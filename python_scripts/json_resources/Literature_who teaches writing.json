You\u2019ll learn to meticulously construct your piece so that every line and image,\nfrom the first word, builds toward an effective ending. You\u2019ll also learn to use your life experience to comment on your\nlife and the world, revealing the ways you have changed as a person between when that event occurred and today.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Perspective\n\u2022 Persona\n\u2022 Voice of innocence and voice of experience\n\u2022 Turn\n\u2022 Scene\nChoosing a Story to Tell\nThe word memoir comes from the French m\u00e9moire, meaning \u201cmemory,\u201d or, more specifically, a person\u2019s memory of their own\nexperiences. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of memoirs as long, narrative books that famous, older people write about their lives, but anyone,\nof any age, can write a memoir. The memoir\u2019s length can be thousands of pages, focusing on many memories connected by a theme\n(like the writer\u2019s experience with their dad over twenty years), or it can be a short essay focusing on one clear memory.\nFor this class, you\u2019ll be writing a narrative essay (not a book!), so it\u2019s easiest to pick one memory for your focus point. While the\nsubject of a memoir can be anything at all, memories that work well for memoir have a few common characteristics:\n1. The remembered event happened long enough ago that the writer has gained new perspective on the event, or a more mature\nway of viewing the situation in light of other experiences and personal growth.\n2. The remembered event inspires complex emotions in the writer to this day. Perhaps those emotions include a mix of pride and 14 | A MEMOIRIST TEACHES NARRATIVE\nsadness, or a mix of anger and joy. The work of memoir involves puzzling out why a memory is important, and how the writer\nfeels about that memory.\n3. The memory includes at least one clear, concrete image that the writer can develop into a scene, a particular moment on the\npage that takes place in a specific space.\nIn the memoir essay \u201cChop Suey,\u201d Ira Sukrungruang1 tells a story of a visit to a bowling alley with his mother that happened when\nhe was a child, long before he crafted the essay. In the memoir essay \u201cDogged,\u201d Barrie Jean Borich2 describes a dog she saw running\nacross the highway when she was a young woman, twenty-five years before she wrote the piece. But there\u2019s no set amount of time that\nneeds to have passed, as long as you\u2019ve been able to gain perspective on that memory. Perspective, in a memoir, means the ability to\nsee the memory with more complexity than you could see it at the time, and the ability to put the memory in context of the world\naround you and other events in your life. The memory also needs to have taken place long enough ago for you to take advantage of\nyour brain\u2019s natural memory sifting process. When something happened last week, it\u2019s often difficult to decide which parts of the\nstory are worth telling, leading to long, dull passages like packing a suitcase for a trip. Years after the event occurs, you\u2019ll have forgotten\nthe inconsequential details, and you\u2019ll be more able to focus on what, for you, was worth remembering.\nWhile great memoir pieces can be about enormous, life-changing events, like a career-ending injury or the death of a family\nmember, they don\u2019t have to be. Sukrungruang\u2019s trip to the bowling alley and Borich\u2019s running dog are small life moments with big\nimplications. What\u2019s important is that you choose something that you can interrogate, dig into. Something that allows you to ask\nyourself why your brain has stored that memory, how you felt about the event then vs. how you feel about it now, and what that\nmemory can tell you about who you are today.\nSplitting Yourself in Two\nWhen a writer crafts a memoir of any length, it\u2019s impossible for them to put their whole self on the page, with every detail that makes\nthem the human being who currently lives in the world. Instead, much like a fiction writer, the memoirist creates a character who\nexperiences and tells the story, choosing the elements of the self that most relate to the situation at hand. In her book The Situation\nand the Story: The Art of Personal Narrative, Vivian Gornick calls that character-self the persona.3\nIn \u201cChop Suey,\u201d Sukrungruang\u2019s persona, or character-self, includes the following: he\u2019s the ten-year-old son of a woman who\nimmigrated from Thailand; he loves his mother but disagrees with her about American culture, people, and life; he has some\nexperience with bowling but no real skill; and he and his mother are the only people of color in a bowling alley full of white men.\nNotice that while the writer chooses what information to give the audience about their persona, they must also decide what to leave\nout. We don\u2019t learn, for example, anything about Sukrungruang\u2019s father, or about other relatives who might be important in his life.\nWe don\u2019t learn anything about the house\/apartment\/trailer\/etc. where he lives, or what he ate for breakfast that morning, or the car\nor train ride or walk to the bowling alley. We don\u2019t learn about his religious beliefs. We don\u2019t learn how he\u2019s doing in school. What\u2019s\nimportant is his relationship with his mother in that bowling alley on that day.\nOf course, the little boy in the bowling alley isn\u2019t the same as the adult, experienced person (or persona) who is narrating the piece.\nThe adult narrator of the piece is proud of his mother, and he\u2019s well aware of her skill at bowling. Sukrungruang begins the essay,\n\u201cMy mother was a champion bowler in Thailand.\u201d The very next sentence shows the contrast between that adult narrator and the\nlittle boy in the bowling alley. Sukrungruang writes, \u201cThis is not what I knew of her.\u201d\n1.

A MEMOIRIST TEACHES NARRATIVE | 15\nIn her craft essay, \u201cInnocence and Experience: Voice in Creative Nonfiction,\u201d Sue William Silverman talks about these two\ndifferent character-selves that show up in every memoir.4 Taking inspiration from the English Romantic poet William Blake, who\nwrote a book of poetry called Songs of Innocence and Experience, she uses the term \u201cvoice of innocence\u201d to describe the younger,\npast persona who experiences the events as they happen, without time for real reflection, and the \u201cvoice of experience\u201d to describe\nthe more mature writer-persona who puts the events into perspective, analyzing them on the page. That adult voice that begins\nSukrungruang\u2019s piece\u2014\u201cMy mother was a champion bowler in Thailand\u201d\u2014is clearly the voice of experience, and the little boy in\na sentence much later in the essay\u2014\u201cI put my head on her shoulder\u201d\u2014is clearly the voice of innocence. But, as Silverman notes,\nthese two voices often intersect and overlap. For example, Sukrungruang describes the moment he learned more of his mother\u2019s\nhistory, writing, \u201cI listened, amazed that my mother could bowl a 200, that she was good at something beyond what mothers were\nsupposed to be good at, like cooking and punishing and sewing. I clapped. I said she should stop being a mother and become a\nbowler.\u201d Crafting that childlike thought and phrasing, \u201cstop being a mother and become a bowler,\u201d Sukrungruang wields the voice\nof innocence. However, readers can also sense some gentle self-mockery from the voice of experience throughout that passage\u2014the\nexperienced adult writer chuckling at his clapping child-self. In a memoir, innocence and experience balance each other out and sing\ntogether.\nWhile Ira Sukrungruang begins his piece with the voice of experience, Barrie Jean Borich takes the opposite approach in \u201cDogged.\u201d\nShe begins with the voice of innocence, narrating the memory as she experienced it as a much younger woman. She writes, \u201cThe dog\non the Calumet Expressway was no discernible breed, a good runner the size of a Doberman or greyhound, sleek and short-haired,\ndark with russet markings. No collar. The dog ran toward my car as I wound around the exit ramp toward the old East Side, where I\nwas headed to pick up Little Grandma.\u201d\nThen, with the beginning of the second paragraph, Borich\u2019s voice of innocence takes a step back, and the voice of experience steps\nin. The voice becomes more thoughtful, less precise, reflecting the fuzziness of memory. \u201cThis was near to twenty-five years ago,\u201d\nBorich\u2019s more experienced voice reminisces. She gives readers the details they need to understand the young persona who experienced\nthat memory, explaining that she\u2019d moved away from Chicago to Minneapolis, and she \u201cwas probably home for a short visit.\u201d We\nlearn that Little Grandma, who doesn\u2019t drive, is Borich\u2019s maternal grandmother, and Borich gives Little Grandma rides on her visits\nhome.\nIn \u201cChop Suey,\u201d Sukrungruang gives readers very little character info about the voice of experience that narrates the piece, focusing\non developing his persona as a little boy. Borich, however, provides equal, or even more, life detail about her voice of experience\/\ncurrent persona, telling readers facts about her current life as well as describing relevant experiences, which presumably happened\nafter the running dog, that helped shape who she is today. Beginning in paragraph four, Borich tells readers she currently owns dogs\nand pampers them, giving them Christmas presents and letting them sleep in her bed. She reveals she\u2019s married to a woman named\nLinnea, and she tells a dog-related story of a time she and Linnea faced discrimination and hate because they were lesbians.\nReading \u201cChop Suey,\u201d you\u2019ll witness a life-changing moment that brought the worldview of the little boy, or the voice of\ninnocence, closer to the adult voice of experience that narrates the piece. \u201cDogged\u201d functions much differently. The dog on the\nhighway didn\u2019t change Borich\u2019s life\u2014she was just never able to forget it. The narrative power of \u201cDogged\u201d comes from the new\nperspective the voice of experience brings to the memory, and from the contrast between the way Borich experienced that running\ndog as a young woman and the way she views that memory today.\nStructure and Scene\nMemoirs of any length build to a turn that comes right at or very close to the memoir\u2019s end and continues to the final word of\nthe piece. At the turn, the memoir plunges into deeper emotional and\/or intellectual territory. The voice of experience comments\n4. Sue William Silverman, \u201cInnocence & Experience: Voice in Creative Nonfiction.\u201d Brevity, 2005. https:\/\/brevitymag.com\/craft-essays\/innocence-experience\/ 16 | A MEMOIRIST TEACHES NARRATIVE\non the situation. The piece\u2019s meaning becomes clear. The reader gets the distinct feeling, We\u2019re getting serious now. Often, though\nnot always, the turn reads like the climax in a fictional short story or novel, with a zoomed-in, slow-motion focus on an important,\ncomplicated scene. In a scene, a specific moment unfolds in a concrete space.\nIn \u201cChop Suey,\u201d the turn begins when Sukrungruang\u2019s mother changes her bowling shoes, and a \u201cman with dark hair and\na mustache\u201d begins walking toward her. The turn lasts all the way to the final line, when Sukrungruang\u2019s mother says, \u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome,\u201d and Sukrungruang\u2019s outlook on his mother and life changes forever.\nSukrungruang\u2019s turn is so effective because he has built the entire piece to set up for that final moment. He\u2019s set up the space\nphysically with the \u201crumble\u201d of pins on the wood floor and the \u201chaze\u201d of cigarette smoke. And he\u2019s set up for the turn on an\nemotional and intellectual level. The first paragraph reveals Sukrungruang\u2019s underestimation of his mother as a ten-year-old, and his\nchildhood lack of understanding of why her view of American culture might differ so much from his own. In the third paragraph, he\ndescribes his mother through the voice of innocence, showing her as a middle-aged, matronly, potentially boring woman with heavy\nmakeup \u201cto cover the acne she got at 50\u201d and a smelly handkerchief she puts over her nose, complaining about the \u201chaze of smoke.\u201d\nBut in that same paragraph, Sukrungruang uses the voice of experience to set up the space\u2019s danger: \u201cMy mother was the only woman\nin the place. We were the only non-white patrons.\u201d\nSukrungruang also sets up the turn with a short scene, narrated mostly through the voice of innocence. Ten-year-old\nSukrungruang tries to show off his bowling skills, fails miserably, and then his mother shocks him after picking up a bowling ball.\nLike any great scene, this one has clear, physical, grounded detail. His mother chooses a \u201cball from the rack, one splattered with\ncolors.\u201d Sukrungruang shows his mother\u2019s body in action, writing, \u201cWhen she was ready, she lined herself up to the pins, the ball at\neye level. In five concise steps, she brought the ball back, dipped her knees and released it smoothly, as if her hand was an extension of\nthe floor.\u201d\nThis scene is crucial for two reasons: Sukrungruang\u2019s mother\u2019s sensational bowling performance begins to change her son\u2019s view\nof her, and her performance apparently challenges the racist, loafing smokers, one of whom soon approaches her to attempt to assert\nhis dominance with racist actions and remarks.\nThen comes the turn, which in this case, functions much like a climax in a work of fiction. The ending stands out from the rest of\nthe essay because of how closely Sukrungruang zooms in, showing every moment. The turn takes up a full third of this short essay\u2019s\nlength. Earlier in the piece, Sukrungruang summed up the dialogue, leaving out the quotation marks, including the line, \u201cI said she\nshould stop being a mother and become a bowler.\u201d In the turn, all the dialogue has quotation marks, and, along with the dialogue,\nSukrungruang shows the man\u2019s changing facial expressions and body language along with Sukrungruang\u2019s mother\u2019s reactions. His\nmother holds tightly to her son and purse, while the man \u201ctoast(s) his beer to his friends, laughing smoke from his lips.\u201d\nLike the scene where Sukrungruang\u2019s mother bowls, the turn takes place in a very specific, grounded space, right behind\nSukrungruang and his mother\u2019s lane, and a \u201cfew lanes over\u201d from where the man\u2019s friends stand. Readers can smell the cigarette\nsmoke. They can see all of the characters\u2019 bodies moving in this specific space: the approaching man clutching his cigarette and\nbeer, the man\u2019s friends \u201chuddled and whispering.\u201d Readers see Sukrungruang\u2019s mother standing up after changing her shoes, and\nSukrungruang himself leaning against her leg. And readers can feel Sukrungruang\u2019s relief and admiration for his mother, and his\nbrand-new understanding of this complicated country and world, as she protects her son and stops the man\u2019s laughter with her\nmeasured response and the look in her eyes.\nIn \u201cDogged,\u201d just like in \u201cChop Suey,\u201d the turn comes close to the end of the piece and extends to the piece\u2019s final word,\n\u201crunning.\u201d While Sukrungruang\u2019s turn hinges on a climax-like scene, Borich\u2019s turn hinges on a revelation through the voice of\nexperience of why she thinks she remembers this dog so clearly, and how she sees the dog differently as a much older writer than she\ndid on the day it ran across the highway. In the next-to-last paragraph, Borich comments on the fact that she has been using she\/\nher\/hers pronouns for this dog during the entire essay, though she wasn\u2019t close enough to determine the sex of the dog. She says she\n\u201cassign[s] [her] memory of the dog a female gender\u201d because she thinks of that dog and sees herself and her female relatives, who lived\non through difficult circumstances that were due, in large part, to the fact that they were women. In the turn, readers understand\nBorich\u2019s difference in perspective that has come twenty-five years later. When she witnessed the dog, Borich felt only sad and worried.\nNow, she remembers that dog and sees the \u201cbreathless, beleaguered female strain to keep on living.\u201d A MEMOIRIST TEACHES NARRATIVE | 17\nAlso like in \u201cChop Suey,\u201d the writer has constructed every line of the essay to build to the turn. However, the piece works\ndifferently because there\u2019s not a whole lot to this memory\u2014it\u2019s just a collarless dog running on a busy highway. The dog on the\nhighway provides a clear, concrete scene, as the dog \u201csp[eeds] toward the rumble of rusted sedans and semi trucks, into the far\nsouthside industrial speedway.\u201d But unlike \u201cChop Suey,\u201d there is no story to spread out over several pages. In fact, Borich gives\nreaders most of the memory of the running dog in the first paragraph.\nIn the subsequent paragraphs, Borich builds toward the turn by providing context through her voice of experience. She defends\nher past self to her current self, and to readers, explaining that because she was on her way to pick up Little Grandma, she couldn\u2019t\nput that dog in her car. Borich tells readers about her current dogs, who wear hats and receive Christmas presents, letting readers\nknow how much it hurt her to leave that dog behind.\nShe also shares a very short additional scene, illustrating the time that Borich and her spouse Linnea took care of two lost Golden\nRetriever puppies. She writes:\nSome rough-looking young men, either neighborhood gangsters or pretending to be, showed up at our door. This was the\nyear we saw neighbor boys with guns stuffed into their pants, the spring city papers started calling the street one block over\nfrom us Crack Avenue. The boys leaned up into our faces, calling us the worst words they could think of to let us know they\ncould see we were lesbians, then accused us of stealing their dogs. We handed the puppies over. A few weeks later we adopted\na dog of our own.\nThe boys at the door, leaning into Borich\u2019s and Linnea\u2019s faces, give the scene its clear image of action in a concrete space. This\nscene fits wonderfully into the essay because it includes dogs, and it builds directly to the ending, setting up the essay\u2019s theme. In this\nscene, two women face danger because of who they are, and they determinedly live on by getting another dog together.\nIt\u2019s important to note that while Borich spends much of her essay in the voice of experience, developing her current persona\nand providing context for the piece\u2019s central memory, she also keeps returning to the running dog in between the background info\nand commentary, keeping readers grounded in that scene throughout the essay. She adds more detail to the running dog scene in\nparagraph three, telling readers it was raining and discussing the area\u2019s terrible pollution at that time, calling it a \u201cyellowish, smoke-\nstained drive to Little Grandma\u2019s.\u201d In paragraph five, she tells readers the dog was \u201crunning\u2026headlong into traffic.\u201d In paragraph six,\nBorich focuses on the dog\u2019s eyes.\nThis brings us to the final paragraph of Borich\u2019s piece. Great memoir endings often have two things in common:\n1. Commentary from the voice of experience.\n2. A final line that leaves readers with a powerful image.\nAt the end of \u201cChop Suey,\u201d Sukrungruang uses the voice of experience to narrate his thoughts about his mother during her\nencounter with the racist man. He writes, \u201cIn that instant, I saw in her face the same resolve she had when she spanked, the\nsame resolve when she scolded. In that instant, I thought my mother was going to hit the man.\u201d Note that in his commentary,\nSukrungruang doesn\u2019t sum up the point of the essay (which is already clear) or tell readers what to think\u2013he just reveals what he was\nthinking in that moment. After his commentary, Sukrungruang ends the essay with the image of his mother\u2019s smile, \u201ctoo bright, too\nlarge,\u201d as she says, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nIn the final paragraph of \u201cDogged,\u201d Borich builds from the voice of experience\u2019s commentary in the previous paragraph, where she\njust analyzed her female gendering of the dog. Now, she uses the voice of experience to zoom out in the running dog scene, showing\nreaders the highway\u2019s proximity to the pollution-choked places where her female family members have led difficult lives. Then, like\nSukrungruang, Borich leaves readers with an image: the running dog, which, seen through through her current perspective\u2013this new\nlens of determination\u2013seems almost hopeful. In Borich\u2019s memory, the dog still runs on that highway, not hit or starving, forever alive. 18 | A MEMOIRIST TEACHES NARRATIVE\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 In a narrative reading that your instructor assigns, where has the writer used the voice of innocence, where has the writer used\nthe voice of experience, and where do those two voices mix together?\n\u2022 In that same narrative reading, find a concrete scene.

It argues that writing about what you love and\ncare about will improve your writing and also deepen your connection to your own expertise. This connection between\nliteracy and expertise likely helps all writers, but it is especially important for writers who may not think of themselves as\ngood writers.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Literacy\n\u2022 \u201cCross Curricular\u201d Literacy\n\u2022 Writing to Learn\nI have been teaching the literacy narrative to students for more than 20 years now. Over time, I have discovered that the best way to\nget students to think about literacy is to put aside any preconceived notions I have about any topic and simply encourage students to\nwrite about and think about what they love. I have always suspected that if you allow students to write about what they care about,\ntheir writing will improve. Even more optimistically, I believe that allowing students to write about what they love will improve their\nlives as well. 20 | A RELUCTANT STUDENT TEACHES THE LITERACY NARRATIVE\nWhen I was growing up, I thought that literacy meant reading books I didn\u2019t want to read. For me, high school English classes were\na blur of scarlet letters, angry grapes, flies with questionable rulership ethics, and people with names like Hester, Francis, and Doras.\nI\u2019m positive that it was a flaw in my own thinking, but I never saw school as relevant to anything in my own life, a life that seemed\nruled at the time by impossible to navigate social orders of popularity and expertise. A lot of my attitude came from my father. He\nabsolutely hated school and always liked to brag about times that he got things over on teachers. Because I\u2019m a writing teacher now,\none story he often tells sticks with me: He wrote the same report six different times about the same book and got six different grades\non that same report. When I was younger, I interpreted the story to be an illustration about the arbitrary nature of school and grades,\nbut when I think about that story now I think it means something more than that, something that suggests that no matter what you\nare planning on majoring in while you are at college, you should get into the business of writing about what you love.\nBut before I get to that, I would like to tell you a little bit about the relationship my dad had to literacy. As he explains it, all\nthrough school whenever he sat down to read he was unable to comprehend what he read. He understood the words, he\u2019d say, but\ncould not comprehend what he was reading. No matter how hard he tried to concentrate, his mind wandered. He\u2019d realize that he\u2019d\nread an entire page and didn\u2019t understand what he read, so he\u2019d go back to the beginning and read again. After reading a second time,\nthough, he\u2019d get just as lost, so he would try again, but that time with the added frustration of having to do it again. \u201cIt was hopeless,\u201d\nhe said. He understood the words, but each time he read they would lose more meaning. \u201cThese days,\u201d he would say when telling me\nthe story, \u201cthey would have said that I had a learning disability, but back in the 50s all the teachers told me was that I was a dumbass,\nthat I\u2019d never do anything but dig ditches for a living.\u201d He would wait for a laugh, which sometimes he would get, and then continue.\n\u201cSo I had this book report hanging over me, and one day I saw this paperback outside of a bookstore in downtown Roanoke. It was\ncalled Street Rod, and I had been working on a \u201851 coupe, and so I thought I could at least relate to this and so I worked my way\nthrough parts of the book, enough that I could write a report on it.\u201d\nMy father was not alone in connecting to this book. In the US, Henry Gregor Felsen\u2019s books were loved (primarily by boys) all\nthrough the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Stephen King named Felsen\u2019s Hot Rod as one of the most influential books of his childhood and it\nis also reported that Felsen was once given an award from a librarian\u2019s association for having written the most stolen library book by\nany author. Published in 1953, Street Rod was the follow up to Hot Rod and would have come out about the time my Dad was 12.\nTwo years before that, my father had bought a lawn mower, so that he could make money mowing loans. As he tells it, he got paid\n50 cents a yard. He had borrowed 63 dollars from his dad for the mower and half of that went to paying off the mower and then\nthe other half he saved. In one summer he had paid off the mower so it was all profit after that. By the time he was 14, he had saved\nenough to buy a car, a \u201851 Ford for 395 dollars. When I was a kid, I found the story a little suspicious, just a story that was meant to\nmotivate me to work, but simple math does prove that this was possible at the time. Cars were simpler then, and anyone who had a\nmind for it and the right opportunities could buy a used car and make it happen.\nIt was only recently that I read Street Rod, and what struck me as I was reading it was how much my dad\u2019s life intersects with this\nbook. At the start of the novel its protagonist, Ricky Madison, has no identity without a car. Ricky Madison\u2019s first decision, the one A RELUCTANT STUDENT TEACHES THE LITERACY NARRATIVE | 21\nthat set the plot\u2019s motion forward, is to buy the car without his parent\u2019s approval. He does, and gets stuck paying $75 dollars (50\ncash, 25 credit) for a car that was likely only worth $35. A combination of pride and stupidity forces Ricky to keep the deal, but also\ngives him a plan: to fix up the car and sell it for a profit. This situation creates in him a drive to succeed, one that goes beyond what\nwould have happened had he not been thrown into this crisis: buy a junker, fix it up, and sell it for a profit.\nAll through his life, my dad did this kind of thing continually. More than once, my mom liked to tell me, she would go to the\nparking lot of where she worked and find that the car she had driven to work had been sold and there was another in its place. It\nbecame a common enough occurrence that she knew to reach on top of the passenger side front tire for the needed key to get home.\nAnd I can confirm that at least once a week there was a different car, or different machine, in the driveway that would be his next\nproject. A WW2 Jeep, A B-Model Mack, An 82 Cutlass body with a 69\u2019 455 Olds engine, a 64 Mustang, A three wheel motorcycle,\nA Harley-Davidson golf cart, A wood paneled station wagon, many different John Deere tractors, various kinds of construction\nequipment: bobcats, front end loaders, backhoes. It was always a combination of vehicles or equipment my father needed at the time\nand something that could be sold at a profit. Unlike Ricky Madison, who would die in the novel\u2019s didactic close because of having\nthe fatal flaw of recklessness, my father made a living embodying Ricky\u2019s plan, eventually going into the auto parts business but\nalways also working these various side hustles, buying and selling machines.\nDad attempted to create this same drive in me, but it didn\u2019t take. I remember when I was a teenager, I bought my first Model R\nJohn Deere tractor with money I had made working at my father\u2019s auto parts store. It came on the back of a tractor trailer, along\nwith three others that my dad had bought from a farm out in Montana. I worked alongside my dad, doing what he did, and taking\nhis advice on it along the way. The tractor needed a new PTO and the rest of the needed work was mostly cosmetic. After putting in\n1200 dollars plus another 400 for parts, I sold the tractor for 3,500 to a farmer in the valley. I remember the farmer pulling a wad of\none hundred dollar bills from his pocket and counting them out in my father\u2019s hand, and then my father handing the money over to\nme. All the ventures I did with my dad along these lines were successful, but it never felt like success to me. As much of a privilege as\nit was, it was borrowed. Though it was becoming clear to me that I was developing a love for words at college, I didn\u2019t have what my\nfather had when it came to selling.\nBut as someone who has decided to give his life to helping other people connect to words, I always wonder whether writing that\nreport on Street Rod played some role in making my father successful. Recently, I became interested in the idea, so I asked my father\nmore questions about it. \u201cWhat do you mean when you say you turned in the same report 6 times?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I never exactly read the whole book through, I would just thumb through the book, come to a part that I found interesting,\ncopy that part down on paper so that I would understand it and then connect that to something I was doing. My teacher didn\u2019t even\nknow what a street rod was, so I had to explain some things. I remember I got a C on the first report, a B on the second, a D on the\nthird and then Cs on the last three. Different grades each time.\u201d\nThis would have happened in the mid-50s, long before any teacher would have encouraged students to revise their work, but it\nseems from my perspective that is what this teacher was doing. Having him revisit the same book, the same report each time. \u201cThis\nwould have been around the same time,\u201d Dad tells me, \u201cthat I was able to trade in my 51 Ford for a 50 Ford that had fewer miles, and\nI put a Crestliner Strip on the 50 Ford, so there was no other 50 Ford in existence that had that Crestliner Strip on it, so years later I\ngot a great price for that Ford too.\u201d\nIn Street Rod, Ricky Madison wanted to make stock cars special in ways that the everyday person would want to buy them. Even\nthough he doesn\u2019t remember any of the details of the book now, he remembers that he chose that book because he could relate to\nit out of his own experience. Beyond that, I haven\u2019t wanted to discuss the issue further. Talking with my Dad about his reading has\nalways been a sensitive subject for both of us. But in my own mind I like to think this teacher was letting him turn in the same report\nover and over again because she wanted him to revisit the topic, to keep refining it, to keep thinking on it, the same way that my best\nteachers pushed me on topics once I got to college. I like to think she had tapped into something like that. And I like to think that\ndoing so helped clarify directions in his own life.\nSo part of the point of this, and why I\u2019ve told you all of this as a way of having you think about the literacy narrative, is there is\nmore than one way to think about literacy. There is the traditional idea of literacy, the ability to read and write words. You put them\nin a row. You learn to make them clear, interesting, and relatively free of proofreading errors. Most of that gets taught in school. But 22 | A RELUCTANT STUDENT TEACHES THE LITERACY NARRATIVE\nthere is a deeper kind of literacy, too. The literacy my father had, knowing what to buy and what to do with it when he bought it.\nKnowing how to go to someone\u2019s garage or someone\u2019s farm, see a piece of equipment, offer a price and take that piece of equipment\nhome and do something with it that would make someone want to buy it. It is important to write about what you know, though,\nbecause doing so allows you to connect to the kinds of literacy you already have and if you write about those, your writing will get\nbetter too. On top of that, your thinking about the thing that you love will get deeper, more refined, throughout the process.\nThe last time that I taught a course on tutoring writing, I was amazed at the number of students who wanted to research and write\nabout students who are neurodivergent, and one of the pieces that really jumped out at me in their research was this:\nNeurodivergent students often talk about reading as something terribly difficult, describing times that they read a book but did\nnot understand a word of it, so they would go back and read again and again until the words got in. On the positive side, though,\nonce they understood a book they could speak on it with detail that went beyond what anyone could do.\nThat was what writing about Street Rod gave my dad, a topic that made him willing to put in the work and it appears to have\nplayed some role in the direction of his life as well\nThat\u2019s what I hope you are able to do when you write your literacy narrative, and I hope it imparts agency way beyond the confines\nof a single class. I have had students write on topics that I\u2019ve known nothing about. I remember one student back in 2010 who\nwanted to write about his experience setting up computers to mine bitcoins. After the class was over, he wrote to me to thank me for\nbeing a supportive teacher and for helping him clarify this direction. (He changed his major to computer science that semester). He\noffered to show me how to set up a few extra computers he saw in a corner of my 4th floor Morrill Hall office to perform repetitive\nactions within World of Warcraft. These actions would prove valuable enough to players that they would exchange them for bitcoin,\nwhich was a fairly obscure kind of cryptocurrency he had just learned about. At the time, bitcoins were worth about 25 dollars a\npiece. I declined his offer, but was happy to have helped him to find his passion. It\u2019s possible that writing the literacy narrative may\ndo the same for you.\nDiscussion Questions\n1. If you had to write about only one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n2.

You will\nuse the framework of theater to think about ways in which you can make your narrative come to life for your audience.\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be ready to construct your own scene, select relevant details, and show your reader\nthe importance of your story.\nKey Terms\nThe following key terms from the theater world will help you think more deeply about your narrative:\n\u2022 Plot\n\u2022 In Media Res\n\u2022 Soliloquy\n\u2022 Thrust Stage\n\u2022 Audience \/ Spectator\nWriting a Narrative that Comes to Life\nWhat is a Narrative?\nIn simple terms, a narrative is a story or an account of events. Narratives allow us to identify and explain patterns in the world around\nus, helping our audience understand our experiences.\nThe storytelling at the center of a narrative is an act of memory making that responds to a basic human desire to be understood A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE | 25\nand remembered. Shakespeare captures this desire as Hamlet expresses his dying wish to his friend Horatio: \u201cIf thou didst ever hold\nme in thy heart,\u201d he urges, \u201cdraw thy breath [\u2026] \/ To tell my story\u201d (5.2.349).1 Lin-Manuel Miranda echoes this sentiment as the\ncast of Hamilton sings, \u201cWho Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story\u201d at the end of the musical. Researchers across disciplines of\npsychology, sociology, anthropology, marketing, literature, and rhetoric and writing studies emphasize the importance of storytelling,\nor narrative, to the human experience.2\nStorytelling is something that you already do on a daily basis. When you email a professor after missing class or recount the events\nof your drive to work to explain why you were late to a boss, you use narrative. You also use narrative to describe the events of a party,\ngame, a class to a friend who was unable to attend. And, you consume narrative every day in the conversations you have with friends,\nthe music you listen to, the TV shows you watch, and the media you consume both intentionally and unintentionally.\nBecause stories are so integral to our everyday lives, you have likely noticed narratives vary in their effectiveness. Have you ever\nlistened to a friend tell a story, only to ask (perhaps silently), \u201cWhat was the point?\u201d Or, even worse, maybe you thought, \u201cThat\ndoesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nAs you construct your own narrative, you need to make sure that you effectively convey events and communicate your purpose.\nFor this chapter, I define narrative as an account of events, organized logically and brought to life for the audience through intentional\nuse of sensory details to accomplish a specific purpose. This definition lays out the key components of a narrative:\n\u2022 An account of events\n\u2022 Logical organization\n\u2022 An intended audience\n\u2022 Use of sensory details\n\u2022 A specific purpose\nTheater and Narrative\nWriters often hear the advice: \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d And, in the theater, everything is about showing. For this reason, this chapter uses\nthe model of theatrical performance to guide you through the writing of a narrative.\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to a play (or watched a movie), you\u2019ve seen a story come to life. Embodied characters act out events, which\nare organized with the intention of eliciting certain reactions or emotions from the audience. The actions on stage, the scenery and\nprops, the sound effects, and the speeches create sensory experiences that help the audience feel like they are part of the action. If a\nplay is successful, at the end you understand why the story was staged. Theater contains all the elements of narrative in an amplified\nform.\nIn this chapter, you will learn to use this knowledge to create more compelling narratives. By imagining the sensory experiences of\nthe theater, you can more easily identify the elements that will bring your stories to life on the page.\nThe theater is especially useful for imagining a narrative come to life for three reasons:\n\u2022 Because theater happens live, it engages all five senses.\n\u2022 Because theater includes a live audience, it provides a source of direct feedback.\n\u2022 Because theater happens in a limited space, it requires careful decisions about what details are essential to the story.\n1. All references to Shakespeare\u2019s plays in this chapter come from The Riverside Shakespeare 2nd ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1997). Some spelling has been updated.\n2. See, for example: Brian Boyd, On the Origin of Stories: Evolution, Cognition, and Fiction (Belknap: 2009); Michael Austin, Useful Fictions: Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature\n(U of Nebraska Press: 2011); and Leonard Talmy, \u201cForce Dynamics in Language and Cognition,\u201d in Talmy, Toward a Cognitive Semantics, Massachusetts: MIT, vol. I. Ch. 7, 409-470.[3]\n\u201cRivals\u201d in this case means something more akin to \u201cpartners.\u201d (See \"rival, n.2 and adj. 3.\" OED Online. March 2021. Oxford University Press. (accessed May 10, 2021). 26 | A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE\nIn these three ways, the theater departs from the medium of film. However, if you have not been to the theater, you may find it\nhelpful to imagine a TV show or a movie when thinking about your narrative.\nThe sections that follow break down the essential parts of a narrative, using examples from the theater to explain each one.\nSpecifically, these sections draw examples from Shakespeare\u2019s drama. Shakespeare wrote for what many scholars have termed \u201ca bare\nstage.\u201d In other words, he had no elaborate set pieces to help tell the story. Considering the strategies that Shakespeare used can help\nus become better storytellers.\nAn Account of Events\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s see the event\u201d \u2013 Fabian, Twelfth Night (3.4.395)\nAt the center of any good story are answers to the questions: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d and \u201cTo whom?\u201d In your narrative, you will\nanswer these questions through your plot and characters.\nPlot\nThe plot is the sequence of events in your narrative. As the question, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d implies, one of the most essential elements of\nthe plot is conflict and change. When deciding what event to portray in your narrative, think about a moment or experience in which\nyour circumstances changed.\nFocus on the event (or set of events) at the center of this change. Then, use basic plot structure to make sure you have included the\nrelevant events:\n\u2022 A story starts in equilibrium. This is the time before change occurs. In your story, you might give some background\ninformation to help the audience better understand your transformation.\n\u2022 Then a conflict, or problem, is introduced, which prompts a change. In a narrative, this conflict might be between two\npeople, two ideas, or two sets of values.\n\u2022 The conflict produces a reaction, or set of events, called the rising action.\n\u2022 These events build toward the climax, or the point of the story in which the outcome is determined.\n\u2022 The events following the climax are called the falling action. This is where all of the things that have been determined in the\nclimax start to fall into place.\n\u2022 Finally, you reach the resolution, or the point at which things settle into a new normal.\nLet\u2019s look at how these plot elements play out in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet:\n\u2022 At the beginning of the play, watchmen observe a ghost who looks like Hamlet\u2019s father (equilibrium).\n\u2022 The conflict begins when the ghost tells Hamlet that he was poisoned by Claudius, Hamlet\u2019s uncle (conflict).\n\u2022 Hamlet wrestles internally with the desire to avenge his father\u2019s death and looks for ways to prove Claudius is guilty (rising\naction).\n\u2022 The conflict comes to a head once Hamlet believes he has proof (climax).\n\u2022 Then, Hamlet confronts his mother, accidentally kills Polonius, is banished, and is challenged to a duel (all the falling action,\nor the consequences of the climax).\n\u2022 Finally, the play resolves during the duel, as Gertrude drinks from a poisoned cup and Hamlet, Laertes, and Claudius die when\nstruck by Laertes\u2019 poisoned sword (resolution). A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE | 27\nImagine if Hamlet had been a well-adjusted character, his father had lived to old age, and Hamlet had inherited the throne just as\nexpected. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s far-fetched to suggest Shakespeare\u2019s play wouldn\u2019t have gained nearly as much popularity.\nEven if your own story doesn\u2019t have as much drama as a Shakespearean tragedy, you can use the plot structure to establish which\nevents are crucial to your narrative. As you brainstorm your own narrative, answer the following questions:\n\u2022 What were things like before the events? (equilibrium)\n\u2022 What happened to create conflict or what prompted a change? (conflict)\n\u2022 As a result of this conflict, what happened? (rising action)\n\u2022 When did the problem come to a head? (climax)\n\u2022 What did you do as a result? (falling action)\n\u2022 How was everything resolved? And what are things like now? (resolution)\nThe answers to these questions will provide you with a basic plot outline.\nCharacters\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what event to portray, you also need to identify the major and minor characters for your narrative. The major\ncharacters are the people who are essential to the story. In other words, the story cannot happen without these characters. When\nwriting a personal narrative, you will be the protagonist, the character who is facing the conflict. The minor characters are there for\nsupport. They help add dimension to the story, but the story does not revolve around them.\nFocus on the main characters. Consider who needs a name and what physical descriptions might help the audience put a face to\nthe name. If you\u2019ve ever read a play before watching it, you\u2019ll notice that many of these descriptions are missing (or imbedded in\nconversation). Because you will not have the benefit of the stage, you need to create visual elements through your writing.\nImagine that you are staging the episode. Thinking about the people in your story as staged characters will help you identify details\nthat are essential to your understanding of the character and their role in your narrative. How would the character style their hair?\nWhat would they be wearing? What would they say and how would they say it? It might even help to identify the actor who would\nplay the character. Ask yourself what about this actor or their past performances makes them a good representative of the person\nwho they are portraying.\nConsider the effect of these two versions of the same event:\nVersion 1: When I was in middle school, my friend brought a cow skull to school for show and tell.\nVersion 2: Elisabeth\u2019s spiral curls bounced as she reached her freckle-covered arm into the black garbage bag to retrieve her\nshow and tell item. I heard gasps from the other students as she pulled out a cow skull.\nVersion 1 gives the reader basic information but does not tell the audience anything about the characters.\nThe additional details in Version 2 help establish Elisabeth as a character. Presumably in a longer version, the reader will learn more\nabout her: perhaps that she received the nickname \u201cFrizzy Lizzy\u201d from her friends or that she spent hours outside each day on her\nparents\u2019 farm. The spiral curls and the freckles become small reminders of larger aspects of her character. In this example, \u201cthe other\nstudents\u201d are the minor characters, who provide context but are not assigned names.\nIn your narrative, use less details when discussing minor characters. Similar to the above example, Shakespeare assigns names to\nhis major characters\u2014Hamlet, Romeo, Juliet, and Cleopatra, while relegating minor characters to their positions\u2014First Gentleman,\nGravedigger, or Page. You might follow a similar model, refer to these characters collectively (for example as \u201cthe crowd\u201d or \u201cother\ncustomers\u201d), or even choose to exclude minor characters from your narrative altogether. Regardless, make sure all details about your\nmajor or minor characters are relevant to the story. 28 | A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE\nLogical Organization\n\u201cOrder gave each thing view.\u201d \u2013 Duke of Norfolk, Henry VIII (1.1.44)\nOnce you have decided what event(s) to portray and which characters to depict, you must decide on the order of events. While\nthe plot describes the chronological order in which events occur, you may choose to present your story in a different logical order.\nFor example, you might start with the climax of your story and then use flashbacks or dialog to show the reader how you got to that\npoint. Or, you may choose to keep your events in chronological order but skip forward in time, highlighting the most important\nevents.\nWhere to Start\nStudents often struggle with how to start their narrative. From a practical point of view, you probably do not want to start by writing\nyour introduction. Start with the material that comes easiest to you or the part of your story that you are most excited to write. Once\nyou have a draft, you can figure out how to introduce your narrative.\nFirst drafts often begin and end by telling the reader why the experience was significant. Although, as a drafting technique, it might\nmake sense to establish the purpose before you start writing, once you get to the final draft, consider what you want the introduction\nto accomplish and what the audience needs to know before they continue. Rather than contextualization, the audience needs to get\na feel of the characters, setting, and tone of the story.\nPlace yourself in the audience of a theater. Imagine if you sat down and the play began with a 10-minute explanation of the theme,\nthe characters\u2019 backgrounds, and all the events that preceded the action. You would probably be bored, and you might even walk out\nof the theater.\nTo grab the audience\u2019s attention, plays often start in media res, or in the midst of things. Here\u2019s an example from the beginning\nof Act 1, Scene 1 of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet:\nBernardo: Who\u2019s there?\nFrancisco: Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.\nBernardo: Long live the king!\nFrancisco: Bernardo?\nBernardo: He.\nFrancisco: You come most carefully upon your hour.\nBernardo: \u2019Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.\nFrancisco: For this relief much thanks: \u2019tis bitter cold\nAnd I am sick at heart.\nBernardo: Have you had quiet guard?\nFrancisco: Not a mouse stirring.\nBernardo: Well, good night.\nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,\nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nNotice how the play starts with a verbal exchange. The play does not provide the audience with background information about\nthe two characters. At the beginning of the scene, the audience doesn\u2019t know who Bernardo or Francisco are or even that they\nare Bernardo and Francisco. We don\u2019t know the occasion of their meeting or the significance of it. Instead, Shakespeare drops the\naudience into the action, as if they have just walked into the middle of a conversation. By the end of this short exchange, however, A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE | 29\nthe audience has learned the two characters names, that the two characters function as some sort of guards working in shifts, that the\nnight so far has been relatively uneventful, and that Horatio and Marcellus are \u201crivals.\u201d3\nThe tension in the first exchange, created with the short responses suggests the possibility that Francisco and Bernardo are leaving\nsomething unsaid, a suspicion confirmed with the entrance of Horatio and Marcellus only a few lines later.\nThrough this exchange, Shakespeare sets the tone and gives the audience information needed to understand the story. As you are\nwriting your narrative, consider whether you can use a short scene to establish tone and key ideas.\nPast Events\nIn Hamlet, we find out from the Ghost that the rumor that Hamlet\u2019s father died when \u201cA serpent stung [him]\u201d is false. The Ghost\ninforms Hamlet (and the audience) that \u201cThe serpent that did sting [Hamlet\u2019s] father\u2019s life \/ Now wears his crown\u201d (1.5.39-40). In\ncase Hamlet or the audience missed his accusation of his own brother, Claudius, the ghost more clearly articulates, \u201cthy uncle stole, \/\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, \/ And in the porches of my ears did pour \/ The leperous distilment; [\u2026] Thus was I, sleeping,\nby a brother\u2019s hand \/ Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch\u2019d\u201d (1.5.61-64;74-75).\nThis murder happens prior to the actions on stage. By the time the play begins, Hamlet\u2019s father is dead, and the ghost already\nhaunts Denmark. The murder is, however, crucial to the events that unfold on stage. Without this accusation, Hamlet would never\nbe driven to \u201cRevenge [his father\u2019s] foul and most unnatural murder\u201d (1.5.25). Rather than give the audience this context before\nthe action starts, Shakespeare includes it in the fifth scene. In doing so, he influences audience perception. Already introduced to\nthe skepticism that the other characters have expressed about the ghost, the audience must decide whether to trust this information\nor disregard it. Their decision affects how they judge Hamlet for the remainder of the play. The introduction of past events at this\nmoment is intentional and provides an organic way to incorporate these details.\nIn your narrative, you may similarly use dialogue to provide important context for current events. For example, your friend might\nsay, \u201cRemember when we went to Dairy Queen? I forgot my wallet and Clint brought it to me.\u201d If Clint is an important character,\nthis story might explain how you first met.\nYou can also recall past events by using flashbacks or by communicating your internal thoughts. There are many ways to do this.\nYou can use markers like \u201clast year\u201d or \u201ca similar event occurred when I was five.\u201d You can also jump back in time (sometimes a\nspace between paragraphs is enough to clue in your reader). Or you can communicate your thoughts through writing that parallels a\nsoliloquy, or the type of speech an actor gives to himself (and the audience), but not the other characters on stage. Let\u2019s say you are pulling\nup in your friend\u2019s driveway. You could use the drive to recall the first time you pulled into that same spot or a moment when you\nfought with that friend in front of her house.\nGaps in Time\nWhen deciding how to organize your narrative, also consider how you will handle the gaps between major events. For example, maybe\nyou had a key experience at 5 that influenced how you dealt with another experience at 18. You won\u2019t have time in your narrative to\nwrite about everything that happened between 5 and 18. So, you can use that space to strategically connect material.\nMy favorite example of Shakespeare jumping forward in time happens between Act III and Act IV of The Winter\u2019s Tale. Act III\nends with a detailed scene, where a shepherd and his son find an abandoned infant and observe a shipwreck. Act IV elaborates on\nthe preparations for a sheepshearing festival 16 years later. Time, portrayed by an actor on stage, gives a speech bridging this gap and\nnoting the important events that have happened during this span: the abandoned infant has been raised as a shepherd\u2019s daughter,\nsixteen years have passed, the baby\u2019s father has grieved, and a new character (Florizel) has entered the action.\n3. \u201cRivals\u201d in this case means something more akin to \u201cpartners.\u201d (See \"rival, n.2 and adj. 3.\" OED Online. March 2021. Oxford University Press. (accessed May 10, 2021). 30 | A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE\nZoom in on what\u2019s important and zoom out on the filler material. In your narrative, consider which events need the stage\ntreatment. In other words, if you were depicting the experience on stage, which actions would you depict, and which would you\ndescribe? See the section on Sensory Details below for more information on how to bring your events to life.\nAn Intended Audience\n\u201cCall the noblest to the audience.\u201d \u2013 Fortinbras, Hamlet (5.2.37)\nAt the end of Hamlet, young Fortinbras issues an order to \u201ccall the noblest to the audience,\u201d cultivating a specific audience for the\nstory Horatio intends to tell.\nYour instructor may ask you to write for a particular audience. Or, you may have the opportunity to select your readers. Either\nway, you should keep your audience in mind as you are writing. Consider what the audience knows and how they will react.\nVisualizing your audience in a theater (and especially a theater that possesses the characteristics of Shakespeare\u2019s stage) will help\nyou identify the characteristics that they possess and the reactions you want to elicit. When you think about the theater, you likely\nimagine a play in the dark with lighting on the stage. Such lighting helps us follow the action, but distances the audience from events.\nShakespeare\u2019s theater was different. There was no barrier between the audience and the stage. The use of a thrust stage meant that\nthe audience surrounded the stage on three sides. Standing playgoers, known as groundlings, stood for the entirety of the production,\njostled for position, and even leaned against the stage.\nBecause the productions happened during the day, playgoers could see other audience members as clearly as they could see what\nwas happening on stage. If an audience didn\u2019t laugh or clap at the right time or if they laughed or clapped at the wrong time, it had\na big impact on the production. The actors had to compete for the audience\u2019s attention and they did that by improvising, making\ndirect eye contact, and using asides to speak directly to the audience.\nEven if the stories you write are not produced on stage, you can still make a meaningful connection with your own audience\nby translating the power of physical embodiment in the theater into the words that you select for the page. Obviously, you can\u2019t\nlook into your audience\u2019s eyes, respond to something they\u2019ve said, or react when their attention fades. But you can still make that\nconnection by considering how they will react. One way to do this is to have someone else read your story. Instead of asking them to\nedit it, ask them to document when they laughed, smiled, teared up, and so on. Ask them when they felt interested and when their\ninterest waned.\nBy identifying your audience and seeking feedback, you can adapt your narrative to capture the audience\u2019s attention. Consider\nwhat terms you might need to define, how much description or explanation the audience will need, and what part of your story will\nmost interest your audience.\nUse of Sensory Details\n\u201cAwake your senses.\u201d \u2013 Brutus, Julius Caesar (3.2.16-17)\nThe word audience comes from the same root word as auditory and implies that playgoers primary engage with a play through\nsound. Sometimes the word spectators is used to describe the same group of people. Spectators, from the same root word as\nspectacles, implies visual engagement with a play. Although this chapter primarily uses the word \u201caudience,\u201d considering both terms\nhighlights the way playgoers or even readers engage through multiple senses.\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your main plot points, decided which parts need the most emphasis, and selected a target audience, you are\nready to fill in the details. These details are what transforms your narrative from telling to showing.\nWhile you may be used to plays or movies with elaborate scenery, Shakespeare did not have this luxury when he wrote or directed\nhis plays. In fact, evidence shows that 16th and 17th century public theater performances used very little scenery and few stage pieces.\nFurthermore, because such performances took place outside in the afternoon, the playwright had little control over the weather or\nlighting. If a scene took place at night under starry skies, Shakespeare had to figure out a way to communicate that to his audience A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE | 31\n(characters carried lanterns or candles). And, some of the magic of Shakespeare is that he continues to communicate it to us today.\nSometimes when you are writing a narrative, you might feel like you are creating something out of nothing. Imagining Shakespeare\u2019s\nstage might help you do this.\nOn the page, your audience cannot see the characters or hear their speeches. That means that you need to paint the scene with\nwords.\nThe Logical Organization section of this chapter briefly mentioned the idea of zooming in and out. Zoom in on what you want\nthe reader to notice. This means deciding which events deserve the stage treatment. In other words, if you were staging this scene,\nwhat events would happen on the stage?\nOnce you decide on these events, consider what is significant about each moment. Significance can come from a moment\u2019s\nrelationship to other events or from symbolic value. Select the details that highlight this significance.\nTake a moment to recall a scene from a play, movie, or TV show that particularly resonated with you. Consider all of the details\nthat went into the production of that scene. If the scene was inside a building, what room was it in? What flooring was used? Walls?\nLighting? Furniture? What props were present? What colors were used in the scene? Where were the characters positioned? From\nwhere did they enter or leave? What did they look like? How was their hair styled? What were they wearing? Consider the auditory\ncomponents of the scene. Who spoke? What was their voice like? What did they say? What other sounds did you hear?\nNow imagine this same scene without each component. How would it be different? What if, for example, all the sounds were\ntaken away? Or you just had a narrator telling you what the characters did, but there was no movement?\nBy imagining your narrative played out on stage, you can identify details that will show rather than tell your experiences. While\nyour final version will not include every prop, piece of scenery, or physical detail of a character, it should include enough of these for\nthe reader to fill in the rest of the picture. The more essential that object, place, or person is to your story, the more details you need\nto provide about it. Use the following techniques to incorporate detail.\nThe Five Senses\nFocus on the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. If you are writing a narrative about your own experiences, think about\nwhat you saw, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt. To practice, set a 5-minute timer and write down everything you sense during those\n5-minutes. Because we experience things through the senses, the best way to show your experience to the reader is by activating their\nsenses.\nMetaphor\nA related way to involve your reader is by incorporating simile or metaphor. What did an object look like, sound like, smell like,\ntaste like, or feel like? For instance, let\u2019s say you are describing a squeaking noise. Is it more like the sound created as a basketball\nplayer pivots on the court or the sound created as a teacher drags a sharp piece of chalk down the blackboard? Or is it something\nelse entirely? What feelings do these sounds evoke in your body? Metaphors use the audience\u2019s own memory to help the reader\nunderstand an unfamiliar experience. Great writing will help the reader feel the sensation of the response in their body. Thinking\nabout your own reaction will help you develop effective comparisons.\nDialogue\nWriting dialogue is another way to help drop your reader into your scene. Sometimes students feel intimidated because they can\u2019t\nremember the exact conversation that they had with someone years ago. However, in personal narratives, it is okay to take minor\ncreative liberties to communicate a point. If you remember the gist of the conversation, you can still put it into dialogue.\nBy using the senses, metaphor, and dialogue, you can paint a picture of characters, scenery, and events to engage your audience at\na sensory level. 32 | A SHAKESPEAREAN TEACHES NARRATIVE\nA Specific Purpose\n\u201cI have spoke to the purpose.\u201d \u2013 Hermione, The Winter\u2019s Tale (1.2.100)\nThis chapter has asked you to imagine your story as if were to be produced on the stage. As you continue to do so, make sure to\nwrite with a clear purpose in mind. Ask yourself:\n\u2022 Why am I telling this story?\n\u2022 What do I want the reader to get out of my story?\nDeciding on your purpose might take some work. And while it is tempting to just pick an event and then later add in a purpose,\nthat\u2019s not going to create the best narrative. A strong narrative starts with purpose.\nTo explore and identify purpose, consider starting with some journaling work. The following prompts may help you arrive at an\nidea for your paper and help you understand why it is important to tell that story:\n\u2022 What keeps you up at night?\n\u2022 What defines you as a person?\n\u2022 What do you wish other people knew about you?\n\u2022 Are you the same person you were 5 years ago? Why or why not?\nSometimes students feel like they don\u2019t have a life changing moment to write about. That\u2019s okay. Your story might be more subtle.\nSome of the best narratives start with small moments that seem insignificant. Focusing on the details around these moments and\nmaking theme come to life will result in a better narrative than a big moment with little relatability.\nConclusion\nFollowing the advice in this chapter will help you write an engaging narrative that accomplishes a specific purpose. Remember, there\nare different styles of writing, and Composition I is a great place to try these out. Reading a variety of narratives as you prepare to\nwrite your own will help you identify the required components and find a style that works for you.\nDiscussion Questions\nUse the following questions to further explore the ideas in the chapter and begin brainstorming for your own narrative.\n1. Think of a time you used storytelling (i.e. narrative) in your everyday life to persuade or inform someone. Were you effective in\nachieving your purpose? Why or why not?\n2. Think of a narrative that you have recently read, listened to, or watched. Then, answer the following questions:\n\u25e6 How did it begin? How might switching the order of the narrative switch the outcome or interpretation of the story?\n\u25e6 Who was the audience for this narrative? How do you know?\n\u25e6 What was the narrative\u2019s purpose? How do you know? What details in the text or story contributed to this purpose?\n3. Imagine you are staging an event from your life. Think about the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings that would help\nthis moment come to life. Make a list of details you could add for each of the five senses.

If it\u2019s a personal narrative, how is it more than being self-absorbed, or\nhow can our own story reach other people? You\u2019ll discover in this chapter ways to give your narrative significance or\nanswer the \u201cso what\u201d question for readers: \u201cwhy should I care?\u201d You\u2019ll learn about the importance of having a \u201cclaim of\nsignificance,\u201d and how to come to that by finding what Donald Murray calls a \u201ccentral tension\u201d in a narrative. You\u2019ll read\nabout the importance of revision to best find and bring out the tension and significance. Finally, you\u2019ll get some ideas for\nhow to get words on the screen by being as particular as you can as well as how your openings and endings can help\ngive your narrative more substance and meaning.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Claim of Significance (\u201cSo what\u201d)\n\u2022 Central tension\n\u2022 Allatonceness\n\u2022 Openings & Endings\nWhy and How to Find the \u201cSo What?\u201d in Your Narrative\nSometimes we feel like we have nothing to say, and we might feel that even more when we\u2019re given an assignment. When I took first-\nyear composition my first semester of college, we wrote personal narratives the entire semester. I had lots to say\u2014I was homesick,\noverwhelmed, but also thrilled about the social happenings coming at me. But I still sat stymied in front of the screen, not sure what\nwould make a good story or what was interesting to readers. Brainstorming helped, but I still had to come up with initial ideas. I A FORMER FIRST-YEAR COMP STUDENT TEACHES NARRATIVE | 35\ndecided to write about things familiar to me from home, stories I\u2019d told that had gotten good reactions from friends. I wrote about\nmy parents\u2019 car I borrowed in high school that could no longer go in reverse; I wrote about a terrible movie date where my date\ndisappeared from the movie theater\u2014I thought he\u2019d ditched me\u2014only to find out that when he got up to use the restroom during\nthe movie, his leg had fallen asleep. He had to crawl up the aisle and was too embarrassed to come back in to the theater, dark as it\nwas. I wrote about a bridge where my friends and I used to converge.\nThese were readable, even engaging, according to my instructor, but she kindly pushed me in her feedback to clarify the point or\npurpose of my essays. To put it not-as-nicely: so what? Coming up with an idea may or may not be the hard part\u2014sometimes it\u2019s\nhaving an idea that readers can engage with and get into, that has a clear purpose, that\u2019s the hardest part. Narrative can be deceptively\nsimple\u2014I\u2019m just writing a story\u2014but it still should have a purpose. Wendy Belcher calls this purpose a claim of significance, which\nis a piece\u2019s \u201cworthiness or value, emerging from its object of study, approach, argument, or solution.\u201d1 She\u2019s talking here about\ndrafting an academic article that typically has a clearer, more overt argument than narrative, but it applies just as much here: to\n\u201canswer readers\u2019 questions of \u2018so what?\u2019 That is: \u2018what will reading this [piece] do for me? Why does\/should your [piece] matter to\nreaders like me?\u2019\u201d2\nHow can we go from an idea, something that sparks our energy or interest that might be a good story\u2014good meaning engaging\nto readers\u2014to a successful narrative? Largely the revision process helps us get there. Revision means to \u201cre-see.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mean to\nwrite to an outline and then \u201cperfect\u201d your points. Outlines can be great to have a foothold and guiding focus, but if it is approached\nas the answer to get to and not a guide to help us develop our writing, narratives can be limited and not have much of a claim of\nsignificance. Rather than, or in addition to, creating an outline, try asking yourself some questions about the moment both when\nyou\u2019re initially drafting or later, when you\u2019re revising.\nDonald Murray, a writing teacher and theorist on the writing process, wrote The Craft of Revision, and in it he says what I think\nconnects to finding a claim of significance: \u201cEvery piece of effective writing will say many different things to individual readers. Good\nwriting has depth and texture, but something should stand out.\u201d3 He calls this a central tension, \u201cwhat makes the focus dynamic,\nactive, something worth writing and reading. There should be forces at work within the focus: a question, a doubt, a conflict, a\ncontradiction.\u201d4 This can happen if the piece is humorous, serious, or both. A central tension is more than an idea or topic and gives\nyou as a writer much more to play with, because an idea or topic don\u2019t automatically come with a central tension. Murray shows\nthis well when he describes writing an essay about your mom\u2014that\u2019s a topic or idea, but not a central tension. But here\u2019s one: My\nmom\u2019s first love\u2014her third husband. (My dad introduces my mom\u2014his wife of over 50 years\u2014as his first wife. Embedded in his joke\nis a central tension meant to be a funny icebreaker when meeting someone new.)\nA lack of tension can be why some topics might fall flat: I\u2019ve worked with students writing an argument essay against drunk\ndriving, for instance, but write themselves into a corner when trying to make their argument, since the vast majority of people agree\nthat driving drunk is a poor choice. But an essay on whether or not the legal limit for drunkenness should be lowered is going to\nbring about differing opinions and give the author more fodder to draw upon.\nSo how do you get to the central tension from an idea or topic\u2014how can you have one purposeful idea come across? Questions\nin the early drafting and revision process can help you get there. Murray offers some great questions to ask of the draft:\n\u2022 What surprised you?\n\u2022 What did you expect to read? How was what you read different from your expectations?\n\u2022 What do you remember most vividly?\n\u2022 What one thing does a reader need to know?\n1. Belcher, Wendy Laura. Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks. 2nd Ed. U of Chicago P, 2019. p.192\n2. Belcher, p. 192\n3. Murray, Donald. The Craft of Revision. 5th Ed., Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2013. p. 60\n4. Murray, p. 60 36 | A FORMER FIRST-YEAR COMP STUDENT TEACHES NARRATIVE\n\u2022 What is the single most important detail, quote, fact, idea in the draft?\n\u2022 What do you itch to explore during revision?\n\u2022 What single idea may the final draft deliver?5\nIt\u2019s through revision\u2014and even if we have a nugget of the \u201cso what\u201d in the initial drafting, it\u2019s rare for the claim of significance to be\nfully discovered, realized, or developed\u2014I came to understand the meaning of the narratives I was writing as a student in my first-year\ncomp class. My funny story about my bad movie date was about the awkwardness and vulnerability of putting myself out there. My\nessay about this plain, cement bridge was about loving a rural landscape that most people overlook.\nOf course, that\u2019s not to say the initial drafting doesn\u2019t set the stage for unearthing the central tension. It may be more accurate to\nsay the scenes may need to be re-staged through revision. A good way to explain it comes from Bruce Ballenger, a writing theorist and\nteacher, who draws on Ann Berthoff\u2019s idea of \u201callatonceness\u201d (all-at-once-ness; she was thinking in hashtags before hashtags were a\nthing). The metaphor she uses is that writing is like learning to ride a bike: you don\u2019t separate handlebar skills with pedaling with\nbalancing, but you get on the bike and try to bring these things together.6 This allatonceness happens because thinking and writing\nhappen simultaneously rather than thinking happening before writing.\nLet me extend the metaphor a bit. It can be frustrating, falling off and getting back on a bike, and so we might cling to the outline\nlike we do training wheels. And training wheels serve us well up to a point, but we\u2019re more limited. Outlines can be a guide, but if\nwe hold too tightly to them, our narrative is constrained and often underdeveloped in its potential complexity. Even more, you as the\nauthor may lose interest, and that can make it harder to get and sustain interest from the reader. In short: the outline can be a tool\nfor your writing but can be less helpful as the end goal.\nWe have an idea, a question, a glimmer toward a possible claim of significance. We know now that writing and thinking together\nmove us forward, but that blank screen might still be intimidating us. How to start?\nTry these two things to get moving:\n\u2022 Start in the middle of a story\u2014meaning a scene or real-time moment\u2014where things are already happening, not so the reader is\nlost or confused, but where she will want to dive right in to keep up\n\u2022 Share that story with particulars and specifics to your experience.\nSometimes less-experienced writers think the best way to reach everybody is to be as general as possible so that the broadest possible\naudience can be reached. Thinking of your audience as everybody is a challenge. You want to have some sense of your audience\u2014a\ngenerally educated person that you want to convince of an argument? An empathetic reader you want to connect to or move with\nyour prose? But you\u2019ll still want to narrow some. For example, in writing this chapter, I\u2019m making a couple of assumptions: 1) that\nyou\u2019re taking a college writing course and 2) that you could have less experience with writing. The first assumption is pretty safe, as I\nwas asked to create a chapter for a book for a writing class. The second assumption could be on the mark but not a sure thing. Maybe\nyou\u2019re someone who has come back to college at age 30 and had a full time job that involved writing. Chances are more students are\nthe traditional college-aged demographic. As the author I can\u2019t know the exact audience, so I have to make some assumptions but\nmust be quite careful in doing so to not resort to stereotypes.\nThe second issue with trying to be broad to be universal is ripe for pitfalls. The idea that we are all human and that we all\nhave universal experiences\u2014heartache, grief, joy\u2014makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t account for our many different identities, experiences,\nbeliefs, upbringings. So my experience of heartbreak at age 18 in a rural town as a white, young adult is likely different than yours.\nAnd yet: writing and stories do allow us to immerse ourselves in other peoples\u2019 experiences and realities, and research has shown\nthat learning about others in this way can improve empathy and understanding.\n5. Murray, p. 62\n6. Ballenger, Bruce. The Curious Writer. 5th Ed. Pearson, 2016. p. 6 A FORMER FIRST-YEAR COMP STUDENT TEACHES NARRATIVE | 37\nHere\u2019s the paradox of particulars: when sharing our narrative, we want to do the opposite of being broad to cast a wide net for\nthe most readers. It is in the particularities that we can best connect to other readers. That isn\u2019t to say that they will have the same\nexperience or that we are all the same, but it is much more likely to invite readers to appreciate, if not feel or connect to, the situation\nof the writer.\nFor example, if I share with you the story of my heartbreak and first set the scene about my first love in high school, I might reveal a\nmoment from my prom at a high school so small that we didn\u2019t need to have dates because we just needed a critical mass to fill up the\ndance floor. So the guy I was crushing on was there at the prom, but he wasn\u2019t my date. Good news, though: he wasn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s\ndate, either. I might describe him as a saw him, leaning over in his rented tux at one of the tables on the gym stage, looking out at\nthe dance floor, me shadowed by the stage in the white, fitted dress with more dazzle than I\u2019d normally wear (I\u2019d borrowed the dress),\npeeking up at him while out of his eyesight. But then my favorite song, \u201cIf You Leave\u201d by OMD begins playing over the loudspeakers.\nI feel a compulsion to ask him to dance; Pretty in Pink had just come out a couple months before, after all. I do, and he says yes.\nNow: you may not have gone to your prom, or you may not be crushing on anyone, or you maybe couldn\u2019t reveal a crush for\ncertain reasons, and my assumption is that your prom was not in the 1980s like mine was. But my hope as a writer is that you could\nstill find a way in to that story in a way that connects to your particulars or experiences in some way even if it was vastly different\nthan mine. In other words: as writers we want to try to connect with our readers through our experiences, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\nshould assume they have the same experiences or feelings about their experiences.\nKeep in mind, then, what Tracy Kidder and Richard Todd say in their book Good Prose: the Art of Nonfiction, \u201cA story lives in its\nparticulars, in the individuality of person, place, and time.\u201d7\nAfter brainstorming and getting distractions out of the way (close browsers, turn over your phone, or better yet, move it), unpack\nthe story that stems from the idea or tension you are pursuing. While doing so, stay in the particulars that come from sensory\ndetails or descriptions that can also reveal tension (notice how I was looking up at my crush on the stage from below. True, but also\nthematically relevant). Later, when I know more about what I\u2019m trying to say (perhaps my essay will be about the realities\u2014versus\nthe 1980s movie versions\u2014of unrequited love), I\u2019ll revise to draw out the tension even more through scenes and moments.\nPerhaps in that first draft, but more likely during revision, you\u2019ll then want to cue readers to that claim of significance\u2014why they\nare reading about this tension at all. (Are you seeing how important revision is, the part that\u2019s often overlooked as we instead put\nmuch pressure on ourselves to come up with the perfect idea than instantly and easily translate it from our brain to the screen?)\nI want to wrap this chapter by speaking to two key parts of a narrative that people either overlook or stew so much over that it can\nstop them cold from producing words: the introduction and conclusion. Only I think it\u2019s more accurate to call them \u201copenings\u201d\nand \u201cendings,\u201d because the ways introductions and conclusions are usually defined are formulaic and too narrow for the possibilities\nthat come with personal narratives.\nAs a reader, getting pulled in to an essay that starts with the broadest, most generic sentence possible is tough: \u201cPeople in society\nlike to have a place to connect with each other.\u201d But starting in the middle of the action by opening rather than introducing the piece\ncan bring readers with you: \u201cI approached the Sarben Bridge, turning off my headlights so I didn\u2019t block the view of the fireflies and\nblind my friends who\u2019d arrived before me.\u201d Openings invite the reader into your story, and then you can leave a trail that signals the\nclaim of significance; in a personal narrative you don\u2019t need to state your central tension directly in the first paragraph, though you\ndo want to clue your reader in to where things are headed sooner rather than later (the first page or so, give or take).\nEndings: those can be daunting, and with good reason. We\u2019ve usually been taught that they either re-state everything that\u2019s been\nsaid or end with a dramatic final thought that magically wraps everything together in a tidy bow for the reader. There\u2019s not one right\nway to end a personal narrative, but rather than thinking summarize or conclude, try leaving the reader with what a lot of writers call\nresonance, an idea or image that has reverberations beyond the essay by leaving readers thinking. Emily W. Blacker explains this well:\n\u201cAn essay ending \u2018works\u2019 when it clarifies and amplifies the dominant theme or emotional exploration of the piece without hitting\n7. Kidder, Tracy and Richard Todd. Good Prose: the Art of Nonfiction. Random House, 2013. p. 14 38 | A FORMER FIRST-YEAR COMP STUDENT TEACHES NARRATIVE\nthe reader over the head with it.\u201d8 This isn\u2019t easy to do, but often ending on an image or moment that references or invokes the\ncentral tension can do this better than spelling it out. (Listen to the essay \u201cRepeat After Me,\u201d by David Sedaris for an ending that\ndoes this beautifully.9)\nIt can feel like a lot, making all of these elements of personal narrative come together seamlessly. Here\u2019s the thing: it doesn\u2019t come\ntogether seamlessly\u2014it comes together by batting around ideas, drafting and lots of revision that gets more focused when you are\nclearer what you are really wanting to get across. Usually when I talk with my students\u2014or myself\u2014about writing a piece, I tell them\nto learn about the genre but not get so caught up that it trips you up while writing. Sit (and put away distractions!) and get to the\n#allatonceness. (Let\u2019s just make it a hashtag!)\nHappy drafting! You\u2019ve got this.\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 What experience do you have with revision? What has worked best for you? Why?\n\u2022 Try this for starting an essay: put the central tension right there in the first paragraph, like talking about a trip to Disney World\nat age 10 but saying you hated Disney World. Roxane Gay does this in her New York Times essay, \u201cWhy the Beach is a\nBummer,\u201d where she takes the assumption that everyone loves the beach and turns it on its head.10\n\u2022 What are some examples you have from books or movies or podcasts or games that really pulled you in as the audience? What\nkind of particulars brought you in to the piece, and why? How could you appreciate or connect to the text whether or not it\nconnected to your own experiences?\n\u2022 Sometimes cutting can be some of the smartest revision we can do. Take a first draft you have and try cutting the current first\nand last paragraph. What gets lopped off? Have you already said it better somewhere else? Can you move an idea or two from\nthose paragraphs elsewhere? Try and see what happens.\nAbout the Author\nDr. Charlotte Hogg\nTEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY\nhttps:\/\/addran.tcu.edu\/view\/charlotte-hogg\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/paxtonista\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/charlotte-hogg-a4239b177\n8.

PART II\nWRITING WITH PRIMARY RESEARCH  5.\nA FEMINIST TEACHES WRITING THROUGH\nINSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY\nDr. Anna Sicari\nAFeministTeachesWritingThroughInstitutionalEthnography._print\nWhat You Will Learn In this Chapter\nIn this chapter, you will learn about Institutional Ethnography as a research methodology and method of inquiry to\ninvestigate a recurring issue you see happening at work, school, any organization you belong to, any \u201cinstitution\u201d you\nbelong to, where you do work. This chapter gives background on Institutional Ethnography, defines key terms and\nconcepts you need to know and how you can apply this to your own work, explains how IE is relevant to the First-Year\nComposition classroom and writing more broadly, gives tips on how to get started on a project using IE, and connects IE\nto feminism and instiutional change. This chapter ends with discussion questions to help you talk about IE and primary\nresearch with others.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Institutional Ethnography\n\u2022 StandPoint\n\u2022 Social Coordination and Ruling Relations\n\u2022 Problematic\n\u2022 Institutional Discourse (Texts)\n\u2022 Feminism\nWhat is Institutional Ethnography?\nDid you ever find yourself at work wondering why things are the way they are? For example, perhaps you are working as an intern\nat a publishing company and you notice that it seems the male-identified interns get more opportunities to work with the editors in\nworking with authors, while the female-identified interns tend to the everyday: answer emails, make copies, run errands. You start\nwondering if it is \u201cjust in your head,\u201d but you have been talking with the female interns who all seem to share similar experiences at 44 | A FEMINIST TEACHES WRITING THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY\nthis company; they are complaining about doing secretarial work when they wanted the opportunity to work with authors and learn\nabout the editorial process. You want to investigate this experience further\u2014to see if other female identified staff feel this way at this\ncompany, possibly at other publishing companies, too. You want to be able to discuss this problem of female staff feeling passed over\nby their male colleagues with your supervisor, but you want evidence to back up your claims. Clear communication, research with\nsignificant findings, and implications for change is necessary for you to make any legitimate case. However, you do not know where\nto start or begin and you find yourself overwhelmed.\nThis is where Institutional Ethnography would come in handy and is a useful sociological method of inquiry to know and learn in\nFirst Year Composition, as work is a central part of our everyday lives and research shows we learn through writing and talking about\nwriting through and with others. Institutional Ethnography is a critical methodology that studies \u201chow things happen\u201d (Smith 5)\nthrough the examination of our work processes and work activities. Work, in IE, can be defined broadly: it can include working at\nan institution or company, or mothering, or being part of a social organization, such as a sorority or a student group. IE was first\ndeveloped by socioligist and feminist Dorothy Smith, for \u201cwomen, and for people,\u201d to better understand how our social relations\nand working activities are shaped for us. Important for readers to know is that Smith was involved in the 1970s feminist movement,\nand participated in and learned more about consciousness-raising; this is a process in which women\/female-identified people met\nand shared common issues that occurred in their lives, both as part of a bonding and problem-solving process. This term is credited\nto feminist activist Anne Forer, when she asked a group of feminists to share how they experienced oppression as women, as she\nneeded it to \u201craise her own consciousness.\u201d Smith was involved in these programs, learning from women their shared experiences\nwith systems of oppression and power (Ritzer & Stepnisky 560-63). This concept of consciousness-raising and encouraging people,\nespecially women and marginalized people, to speak from their own experiences is key to understanding IE and its aims, as IE asks\nfor people to look up from their everyday experiences to understand how these experiences are linked to the translocal and organizes\neveryday experiences. The emphasis is on what people do\u2013with work as a broadly conceived notion\u2013 and what individuals say and\nknow about their work as experts, that point to larger patterns of shared experiences to uncover institutional organizations of power\nthat influence and shape such experiences.\nIE provides tools to examine our work and the institutional forces that shape what we do so that we can have knowledge and\ninsight, from data, to reform and bring intervention to these spaces\/institutions. IE draws on data collection methods typical in\nmore traditional forms of ethnography: interviews, case studies, focus groups, textual analysis, discourse analysis, autoethnography,\nparticipant observation, and archival research. IE asks its practitioners, however, to \u201clook up from where they are\u201d to map up and\naway from just the personal to identify patterns. Two important scholars of IE, Marjorie DeVault and Liza McCoy describe the steps\nof IE research as this: \u201ca) identify an experience b) identify some of the institutional processes that are shaping that experience, and\nc) investigate those processes in order to describe analytically how they operate as the grounds of experience\u201d (20). IE is interested\nin examining how something happens and there are five core concepts, or tools, to understanding IE that this chapter will briefly\nuncover: standpoint, social coordination, ruling relations, problematic, and institutional discourse (or texts).\nStandpoint\nStandpoint is drawn from feminist cultural materialism, and we can see the influence of the feminist consciousness- movement most\nclearly rooted int his concept. The researcher in an IE project is part of the research experience: that is, they are participating in\nthe work processes that they seek to discover\/learn more about. Standpoint makes clear that the uniqueness of an individual shapes\ntheir experience, and research narrative; so, for the female-identified intern at the publishing company in the earlier anecdote to this\nchapter, their experience with the company is different than the male-identified interns, but is similar to the female-identified staff,\nalthough their stories, too, are uniquely situated to them as individuals. Those who practice IE do so with the full knowledge that all\nknowledge is \u201cpartial,\u201d grounded in \u201cmaterial experience\u201d (the embodied and everyday work\/way we live), and a reflection of social\ndynamics. Two writing studies scholars write about standpoint in their article, \u201cInstitutional Ethnography as Materialist Framework A FEMINIST TEACHES WRITING THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY | 45\nfor Writing Program Research and the Faculty-Staff Work Standpoints Project,\u201d \u201cThe uniqueness of individual experience\u2013the\nresearcher\u2019s personal experience or knowledge of a site and what has been gleaned from interviewing and observing\u2013provides the\nguiding perspective for the research narrative produced\u201d (136). In the intern example, the female-identified intern wishes to seek out\nevidence on the treatment of female staff based on her experience and the discussions she has had and witnessed with her fellow\nfemale-identified staff. This research narrative is grounded in her experience, which is partial, embodied, and materially situated\u2013in\nIE, this is important, as the researcher acknowledges their participation in the research and how their own experiences have shaped\ntheir research narrative and project.\nSocial Coordination and Ruling Relation\nSocial Coordination is a unique core component to IE, as it discusses how both institutions and individuals participate in everyday\nsocial relations. Institutions are \u201csocial entities\u201d (LaFrance) that are created by individuals who take up a similar practice: ie, colleges,\nuniversities, hospitals, prisons, businesses. Institutions would not exist without social coordination, and the relations\/networks that\npeople create, and yet they also shape the existing realities of relations. For example, the publishing company was created by a network\nof people who share similar interests in producing texts; in order for the publication of texts to occur, different relations and networks\nwere formed within the company that produces different hierarchies in the company, with interns being on the lower-end of the\ntotem pole (often, intern positions are unpaid with little incentives). Individuals constructed such hierarchies, and yet struggle to\nunderstand how to untangle such hierarchies when they become problematic, as certain systems\/networks in place have been set\nup \u201cforever.\u201d Social relations also impact the way a worker might respond to treatment at work. For example, the female-identified\nstaff of interns who have been complaining about their treatment have formed their own network within the larger network of the\npublishing company; as they complain, many recognize their place within the company, that is, they have very little power or say, as\ninterns. As this publishing company has professional codes and standards, a few of the female-identified staff are afraid to speak out,\nfearing that this will be seen as causing \u201ctrouble\u201d at work. Understanding the complex social relations involved in work processes is\nimportant for those wanting to do IE research; how does one give voice to those who feel powerless and marginalized, especially if the\nresearcher is part of that social network? What are the risks that are involved? It is also important to think about how social relations\ncreated these conditions in the first place: how does the treatment of women in society, historically and locally, play a role in the\ntreatment of women in the workplace, more specifically the publishing industry, and even more specifically, at this one publishing\nindustry? How does the national context shape the treatment of female-identified staff? How does the local? And how might this\nstudy help other female interns in the future, given the complex web of social coordinations? These are important questions to\nconsider, and examining power dynamics within social relationships and networks is key in IE through the third core concept: ruling\nrelations. Ruling relations are \u201cthat extraordinary yet ordinary complex set of relations\u2026that connect us across space and time and\norganize our everyday lives\u201d (Smith 10). Ruling relations delineate and draw on complexes of power and authority and put into focus\nhierarchies within institutions, such as position\/rank and expertise; they also reflect ideologies, histories, and social influences. The\nfemale-identified intern also observes that many of her supervisors are white, male-identified, although her immediate supervisor is\nfemale-identified. She begins to do research on the different positions within her company, and who occupies which position, as she\nconsiders the experiences of the female interns and their concerns. Who is being promoted and what social influences might impact\nwho is getting opportunities? How do the male-identified interns feel about their work? IE allows for the researcher to tease out these\ncomplex power dynamics and work through the nuances and coordinations of hierarchy.\nProblematic\nThe problematic is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d to Institutional Ethnography, as it defines the major issue that needs to be researched, or, to\nquote LaFrance and Nicolas, \u201cis a situated point of entry,\u201d and IE researchers begin with a problematic. A researcher\u2019s problematic 46 | A FEMINIST TEACHES WRITING THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY\n\u201csets out a project of research and discovery that organizes the direction of investigation from the standpoint of those whose\nexperience is its starting point\u201d (Smith 10). A problematic is used to direct attention to a series of questions or concerns that arise\nfrom the people\u2019s everyday concerns; it comes from the people on the ground, doing the work for an institution. In the publishing\nsituation, the problematic is investigating the experiences of the female-identified interns at a local publishing company to better\nunderstand how their experiences have been shaped by institutional factors. A problematic takes into account that not all individuals\nwill be oriented into a practice\/ experience work in the same way, and starts from lived experience that competes with the work\ndiscourse to understand why an individual, or group of individuals, experiences at work compete with the workplace discourse. In\nthe publishing company scenario, the company has a mission that it strives for inclusivity and diversity. This mission statement is\nposted on their website, a copy of it is in the main office, and it is often pasted in individual email messages from supervisors in their\nsignature. The workplace discourse is one that emphasizes inclusivity, and yet the female-identified interns feel as if they are not being\ntreated as their male colleagues in terms of opportunities in the workplace, how they are talked to, and the types of responsibilities\nplaced on them. The people on the ground, who make up the employees of this workplace, do not feel as if they are being included\nin the work, and feel excluded based on their gender, and perhaps rank. These experiences of the female-identified staff are a site\nof contest within the larger, professional organization who work under a mission of inclusivity and diversity. While the company\nliterature and discourse might talk about the work under the framing of inclusivity, the people who work for the company, in this\ncase, the particular subset of female-identified interns, talk about the work in much different terms. This is the problematic, and\nthe cornerstone to the project1. The problematic points to the direction of the investigation and helps the researcher frame guiding\nresearch questions to develop the study, while taking into account core concepts of social coordination and ruling relations. The\nproblematic allows us, too, to understand how the research begins in lived and material experience.\u201d\nInstitutional Discourse (or Texts)\nTexts, and institutional discourse more broadly, are key and central to any IE project. As IE is interested in the everyday, material\nworld of institutions and work, the texts that socially coordinate people to the work are necessary elements in this methodology.\nAs Michelle LaFrance and Melissa Nicolas write, \u201cTexts are shapers of thinking, language use, and ideology. Usefulness, meaning,\npurpose, and accountability arise from the reality of the texts\u201d (140). Think about how important and ubiquitous texts are at a\nworkplace. Work documents, such as emails, text on websites, memos, policies, mission statements, coordinate and shape how we\ntalk and think about work\u2013how bosses talk about the work, how they talk about the work to different employees, how people talk\nabout work to each other, how we talk about the work to ourselves. Texts also include the work that we do: medical charts, reports,\nlesson plans, research, any form of writing that is associated with our work. Social media posts further the importance of texts to\nour everyday work, as it frames the way work is discussed to so many different audiences (on a global level). These texts make up\nhow the work is communicated to and with different people and audiences. Institutional ethnographers recognize how crucial texts\nare for research purposes: the work documents, the texts, coordinate activity, coordinate how the work happens, and it is through\ntexts that institutional ethnographers can make visible the relationship between the institution and the embodied individual doing\nthe work. For the female-identified intern wanting to understand gendered behaviors and relations at her workplace, she might also\nwish to analyze work documents: emails sent out to staff, memos on workplace conduct and professional attire, HR policies on\ndiscrimination in the workplace, the job descriptions of interns. These texts shape the social coordination of the workplace and also\nare key in creating change at an institution. The staff person can use these texts, along with the interviews, to explore how certain\npeople, namely female interns, are being regulated to certain types of work activities and through finding patterns, bring data to the\ninstitution, and\/or her boss, and discuss their findings.\n1. It is important to note, too, that the problematic does not always have to be a problem (although in this example\/scenario, it clearly is) to be \u201cfixed.\u201d In IE, it could be more exploratory: for\nexample, the study of professional development for ICU nurses at a research hospital and examining what professional development might look like for these nurses. A FEMINIST TEACHES WRITING THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY | 47\nThese five organizing principles of Institutional Ethnography show how this framework asks researchers to approach ethnographic\nwork. However, it is important to emphasize that these principles can be extremely flexible in practice, allowing the researcher to\naddress the locally situated and flexible experience and practice of their particular work situation. Dorothy Smith is objective to any\nidea on IE becoming an orthodoxy or a sect, as the key to IE is that it is committed to exploration and discovery. And while there are\nthe definite principles this chapter went over, there are many ways of realizing them into practice. A central idea to IE is that, as a\nmethodology, it \u201cchallenges the notion that work practices or experiences\u2026are accidents of circumstances or the inevitable product\nof processes beyond anyone\u2019s control. IE foregrounds the relationships that exist between the material conditions of work practice\nand choices individuals make as they negotiate their situations\u201d (LaFrance & Nicolas 141). IE recognizes the complexity of work as it\nencompasses relations, material realities, and how power and talk influences our everyday decisions and choices that we make; it also\nallows for researchers to start in their own experiences, to map out the many influences and structures that shape these experiences,\nand to conduct a study that will help us explore how certain things happen. To turn back to our opening anecdote of the female\nintern, it is important to recognize what a complex and difficult situation she is in at work, and how her experience is both highly\nsituated and individualized, and yet also reflective of larger issues of female discrimination in the workplace (which is absolutely\na reality). While IE will not be the answer to this young person\u2019s issues at work, as it is a methodology focused on discovery and\nsituated practice, it will help her understand how these gendered experiences happen to a particular group of workers, interns, at this\nparticular institution, a publishing company. Recognizing the how something happens, how forces of institutional sexism work, is\nkey and central to revising and addressing serious systemic issues of oppression in the workplace.\nWhy IE in First-Year Composition and How to Get Started on\nYour Own Study\nInstitutional Ethnography, rooted in the personal and material world, is extremely relevant to any writing course, as it helps\nwriters\/researchers understand their local realities, and how they are always in relation and coordination with larger discourses and\ncommunities. The IE researcher better understands concepts of audience, genre, communication, and relationality\u2013all key concepts\nthat are important to writing. IE asks us to start from the everyday as we understand the problematic, and through this problematic,\nform guiding research questions; in this way, IE asks us to reflect and write on our experiences first before we form research questions.\nTextual analysis, too, is vital to an Institutional Ethnographer, as texts (which include interviews and focus groups), help us in finding\npatterns and \u201cmapping up.\u201d And it asks researchers to truly think about revision; what is mapping telling us about the institutions\nand work that we participate in, and how can we use these findings to revise? As writing studies scholar Michelle Miley writes on\nIE, \u201cThe findings\u2026allow us to draw maps, maps of intricate relationships that define our work\u2026These maps can then guide as we\nadvocate [for change]\u201d (Miley).\nIf interested in getting started on an IE project, take the time to think about your work. This can be work in which you are\nemployed by an institution, paid or unpaid, or this can be work more broadly defined: the work you do as a student, the work you do\nas a sibling, as a parent, as a member of an organization. Free-write about what a typical day at work looks like\u2013perhaps keep a journal,\neven. As you write, reread your entries and start reflecting on experiences\u2013are their commonalities or issues you want to explore?\nWhat is your problematic, or situated point of entry that you could investigate? Define your problematic. What type of questions\ncan help you discover more about this experience? Start drafting questions and share with other people\u2013perhaps take a visit to the\nwriting center, or share with your friends, your classmates, or the people that you work with. Once you have done this, and revise your\nquestions and have them be your research questions; keep in your mind concepts such as ruling relations and social coordination as\nyou work on these questions. Make sure you are aware of your own standpoint in this research. Then, it will be helpful to then start\nthinking about methods to help you explore these questions\u2013interviews, surveys, focus groups, autoethnographies, field work\u2013what\nmethod is best for your discovery process? This can be several methods, or just one. As you start drafting interview questions, or\ndesigning your survey, it will also be helpful for you to think about important texts\/documents of your everyday work to analyze.\nCollect the material and start coding for patterns. Continually reflect and draw notes on your data, and begin the mapping process. 48 | A FEMINIST TEACHES WRITING THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY\nIf needed, seek more interviews, survey responses, stories that will help systemize your findings2. Draft, redraft, revise; this process is\nrecursive and continually evolving; allow yourself to embrace discovery and not fear messiness. Allow yourself to uncover how things\nhappen and enjoy the experience!\nFeminism, IE, and Writing\nInstitutional Ethnography is grounded in feminist practice and its roots are founded in the 1970s feminist movement; IE encourages\nthose from marginalized positions to speak about their experiences and to use their material world as a starting point for research.\nWhat is feminism you might ask\u2013and it is a good question. I will let bell hooks, a renowned feminist and critical race theorist\/\nscholar\/activist, answer this question through her simple, yet important, definition: \u201cFeminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist\nexploitation, and oppression\u201d (hooks 18). Feminism asks us to imagine a world in which we can all be who we are, in a world of peace\nand possibility; and we must work together to fight all forms of oppression. IE asks us to think about ways to reform and reshape\nour work through the lens of marginalized positions, in order to create more just and equitable spaces. Writing and communication\nis how we spread ideas and help bring change to the world\u2013from the local to the global; you cannot separate identity from writing.\nIE is one more tool for you as a writer and researcher to think about ways in which your own writing can lead to reform and change,\nfor the good of everyone.\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 How might IE help us in understanding how things happen across institutions and organizations? What concept did we find\nparticularly useful in helping us think about IE as a methodology useful to us?\n\u2022 IE, as discussed in this chapter, is grounded in feminist research. Thinking about this chapter, and its particular understanding\nof feminism, how can we apply feminist work to our everyday lives? Why is it important to do so?\n\u2022 Brainstorm a series of issues or concerns you see taking place at a particular institution you work for and\/or a member of.\nShare these issues or concerns with a partner and begin drafting questions that might help you investigate how these issues\nhappen. Can you identify the problematic you wish to explore through IE?\n\u2022 IE begins with your personal, lived experience. Narrate your experience at work, at this organization, similar to the anecdote in\nthis chapter. After writing your narration, and thinking about the problematic, begin thinking about possible methods you\nwould use to explore the research question in your study. Would you collect documents? Would you interview other people in\nyour position? Would you survey people?\n\u2022 After reading this chapter, what is your understanding of feminism? Feminism asks us to continually reflect on our ethos and\nways of being in this world. How can we make sure we are ethical researchers when we use IE?\n\u2022 What are potential questions you have with Institutional Ethnography? What are your questions you have with primary\nresearch in general?\n2. It\u2019s worth mentioning that if you wish to present your work at a conference or to eventually publish your study, and you are working with human subjects, you must first obtain an IRB.

You will also\nlearn how to write an essay using this \u201cprimary\u201d research as your main source. By the end of this chapter, you should be\nable to use primary research in combination with secondary research to make a specific claim in response to a research\nquestion or problem.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Primary Research\n\u2022 Secondary Research\n\u2022 Interview\n\u2022 Writing Studies\nConducting Interviews as Primary Research\nIn the humanities and social sciences, one form of primary research (data that the researcher collects themselves) is the personal\ninterview. In college writing classrooms, instructors often assign primary research projects like the interview in combination with\nsecondary research (existing data in the area you\u2019re investigating) to shed light on a problem, issue, or topic. This is a challenging\nwriting task because it involves several steps that tap into different writing abilities: First you have to figure out who you want to\ninterview; then you have to decide what questions to ask; then you have to conduct the interview and record their responses in\nsome way; and finally you have to write your report and incorporate their responses into your own writing. Despite the difficulty\ninvolved, these techniques are used in several different contexts outside of humanities-based research. For instance, journalists write A WRITING STUDIES SCHOLAR TEACHES INTERVIEW-BASED WRITING ASSIGNMENTS | 51\nstories based on personal interviews with influential people and\/or experts; police officers interview eye-witnesses and write police\nreports to document their investigations; an auditor investigating the finances of a company may conduct an \u201caudit interview\u201d with\nemployees to learn more about the financial information of the company. In each case, these professionals use interviews to collect\ninformation from specific people, and then use writing to put those interviews into context for specific audiences. According to Dana\nLynn Driscoll, interviews \u201care an excellent way to learn in-depth information from a person.\u201d So what are some basic guidelines for\nconducting an interview for a research paper in college?\nDiscovering your Purpose\nThe first thing you will need to do before conducting an interview is to figure out the purpose of the project. The purpose will vary\ndepending on the assignment instructions, the goal of your project, or the criteria on which you will be evaluated. Nevertheless, there\nare some basic guidelines for discovering your purpose that apply in almost every scenario. First, you\u2019ll need to ask yourself, why do\nI need to conduct interviews? What am I supposed to find out from my interviews? For example, is your purpose to collect expert\ntestimonies from people who can provide insight into specialized topics? Or, perhaps you are being asked to conduct an interview\nthat profiles an individual person and their day-to-day lives? Other purposes for interviews may simply be to share somebody\u2019s story\nor to shed light on an important topic. According to Irving Seidman, in-depth interviewing ultimately is about trying to understand\nother human beings through their own interpretations of their experience (9). In other words, interviewing is about discovering how\nreal people understand the meaning behind their behaviors and experiences. As a researcher, then, your goal before you embark on\nan interview-based project is to discover which human experiences would best help you figure out what you want to learn. So let\u2019s try\nthis. See if you can answer the following questions prior to designing an interview-based college writing assignment.\n1. According to my instructor, the main goal of this assignment is to ______\n2. I am being asked to conduct interviews so I can learn more about ______\n3. In order to learn more about ______, I need to learn more about the experiences of _____ and how they attach meaning to\n______\nAs you can see from the questions, before you do an interview project, you need to be able to articulate the main goal of the\nassignment, the main learning outcome you\u2019re supposed to meet, and the specific people and their experiences that you think will\nlead you to that outcome.\nSo, let\u2019s say your first-year composition instructor asks you to interview someone who works in your future industry and then\nwrite a paper summarizing the way they write in that field. Let\u2019s also say that you\u2019re an aspiring mechanical engineer. Your answers to\nthe questions above might be as follows:\n1. According to my instructor, the main goal of this assignment is to interview someone in mechanical engineering and\nwrite a paper about their writing practices\n2. I am being asked to conduct interviews so I can learn more about how writing works in the field of mechanical\nengineering\n3. In order to learn more about mechanical engineering, I need to learn more about the experiences of working mechanical\nengineers and how they attach meaning to their day-to-day activities.\u201d\nIn the above scenario, the student\u2019s answers to these questions (in bold) will help them tailor their interview questions to the specific\npurpose for the project. If you have an interview-based writing assignment, try filling in your own answers and see if it helps the\nbrainstorming process. 52 | A WRITING STUDIES SCHOLAR TEACHES INTERVIEW-BASED WRITING ASSIGNMENTS\nSelecting Participants\nAfter you\u2019ve discovered the purpose of your interview project, your next step is to decide whom to interview. Part of this is logistical:\nWhat do you have time for? Who among your network would be willing to participate in an interview with you? Do you need to\ninterview one person, or multiple? Should it be people you know, or do you need to contact people you\u2019ve never met before? The\nanswers to these questions all depend on the specific assignment.\nSay, for example, your composition instructor asked you to interview an expert in the industry you hope to enter after college. If\nyou are an aspiring high school teacher, for example, it might be best to reach out to a former teacher of yours that you still keep\nin contact with. However, if your assignment was to interview an expert on an important issue impacting your community, there\u2019s\na chance you may not know anybody in that field. In that case, you would contact local nonprofits and community activists who\nspecialize in that specific issue, and then email or call to schedule an interview with someone. Whatever you do, it is important you\nunderstand the connection between the participants you select and the ultimate goal or learning outcome of the assignment.\nDesigning Interview Questions\nSo let\u2019s say you\u2019ve chosen an interview participant and they have agreed to be interviewed by you. Well done! This kind of logistical\nwork is a challenging part of the writing process, because you need to cultivate your interpersonal skills and display confidence so that\nyour interview subjects feel comfortable. But now, with an interview on the calendar, you need to come up with some questions. The\nbest way to brainstorm questions is to make broader conceptual connections to your overall purpose, in the same way we did above.\nSo for example, you may remember that the interview is essentially a way to create new insights into a topic using a real live person\u2019s\nquotations as evidence. In that case, your next task is to determine what kinds of questions would help you create specific insights\nthat the assignment is asking for. As you brainstorm, try to come up with answers to the following prompts:\n\u2022 In order to learn more about _____, I am interviewing _____\n\u2022 Some specific experiences I want _____ to elaborate on might be _____\nNotice that these prompts are designed to help you make explicit connections between the interview questions and what specifically\nyou want to learn. So, let\u2019s say you have an assignment that asks you to interview a faculty member at your university and write a\npaper about their research. Here\u2019s how you might answer the previous brainstorming questions:\n\u2022 In order to learn more about faculty research at my university, I am interviewing my American history professor\n\u2022 Some specific experiences I want my professor to elaborate on might be what her book is about, how she came to be\ninterested in this topic, and why this topic is important for people to understand\nAgain, it\u2019s important to notice here that the answers (in bold) are directly tied to the topic you want to learn about. From here, you\ncan design interview questions that are directly relevant and interesting for your participant.\nInterview Questions to Avoid\nWhile the kinds of questions you ask need to be specific to your overall purpose, there are some kinds of questions that won\u2019t lead\nyou in the right direction. According to the Purdue OWL, there are five types of questions you want to avoid.\n1. Biased Questions: You do not want to ask or word your questions in a way that attempts to lead your participant in a certain\ndirection. For example, if you are interviewing an expert about tax reform, you don\u2019t want to phrase a question like: A WRITING STUDIES SCHOLAR TEACHES INTERVIEW-BASED WRITING ASSIGNMENTS | 53\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree that we need a flat tax rate in this country?\u201d Instead, phrase it as an opportunity to learn about an issue:\n\u201cWhat would you say are some of the pros and cons of a \u2018flax-tax\u2019 policy?\u201d\n2. Questions that assume what they ask: In the field of rhetoric, this is a common fallacy called \u201cBegging the Question,\u201d\nwhich is essentially stating or presuming something as a fact when you\u2019re actually trying to prove or learn more about it in the\nfirst place. So for example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re interviewing a film historian and you say: \u201cWhy is Citizen Kane the best movie of all\ntime?\u201d That\u2019s begging the question. You can\u2019t presume the conclusion of your statement when you\u2019re the one actually trying\nto learn more about it. Instead, ask, \u201cWhat would you say is one of the best movies of all time?\u201d\n3. Double-Barreled Questions: A double-barreled question is a kind of clumsy interview technique where you ask multiple\nquestions at the same time. This makes it difficult for participants to answer clearly and effectively. So, for example, let\u2019s say\nyou\u2019re interviewing your history professor about their research and you say: \u201cHow did you become interested in pre-civil war\nhistory and what is its main relevance today?\u201d This is \u201cdouble-barreled\u201d because it asks them to speak on two questions at\nonce. Instead, ask one question at a time, \u201cHow did you become interested in pre-Civil War history?\u201d After they answer, you\nmay then choose to follow up with, \u201cWhat lessons did you see in your studies of pre-civil war history that are applicable\ntoday?\u201d or perhaps you can ask a follow-up question specific to their answer.\n4. Confusing or Wordy Questions: You want to make sure that the questions you ask are worded in such a way that the\nparticipant knows exactly how to respond. So for example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re interviewing a working professional about the kinds\nof writing they do at their job. They might get confused if you ask them, \u201cWhat do you think about writing in the\nworkplace?\u201d This is a confusing question because it\u2019s so open-ended that they\u2019ll likely only provide vague answers. Instead,\nmake sure your question asks about specific things or actions. Try something like, \u201cWhat are some specific documents you\nhave to produce as part of your day-to-day work as an engineer?\u201d\n5. Questions unrelated to your purpose: The last kinds of interview questions to avoid, according to Purdue OWL, are\nquestions that are unrelated to what you are trying to learn. When conducting an interview for your writing class, you need to\nask yourself if the questions you are asking will help you meet the outcome of the assignment. For example, say you\u2019re profiling\na director at a nonprofit, and the assignment is to learn more about the issue in the community they\u2019re trying to solve. You\nwouldn\u2019t want to ask a question like, \u201cWhat do you think about the recent election?\u201d While the person\u2019s views on this topic\nmight be interesting, the answers are likely not going to help you answer your main research question, and you don\u2019t want to\nwaste their time.\nConducting the Interview\nHere are a few more tips about conducting effective interviews.\n1. Help your participant feel comfortable. Start with a minute or two of small talk so it doesn\u2019t feel like an interrogation.\nRemember, this is a conversation after all.\n2. Ask up front if you can record. It is important that your participant knows they are being recorded, and you don\u2019t want to\nhide it from them or ask them in the middle of your conversation.\n3. Please know that it is perfectly OK to go \u201coff script\u201d when you are interviewing. While you may have thought long and hard\nabout your questions, sometimes the interview goes into new directions you didn\u2019t anticipate. Don\u2019t be so rigid that you can\u2019t\nexplore a new opportunity as the conversation develops. This kind of flexibility can help you learn new things you didn\u2019t even\nrealize you could learn from an interview.\n4. Do your research. Before conducting the interview, try to learn as much as you can about the person you\u2019re interviewing.\nWhat\u2019s been written about them already? Have they given interviews in the past? What kinds of questions have they answered\nalready, and how can you ask new or updated questions? Learn statistics about the broader issue you\u2019re investigating so you\ncan show your participant that you are interested and knowledgeable about the subject you are discussing. 54 | A WRITING STUDIES SCHOLAR TEACHES INTERVIEW-BASED WRITING ASSIGNMENTS\n5. Know the difference between open-ended and yes\/no questions. In other words, you need to make sure the questions you ask\ncan get you where you need to go in the interview. If you ask a question that can be answered in only yes or no, that\u2019s where\nthe discussion will end. Sometimes, that\u2019s OK. For example, the question, \u201cDo you enjoy your job?\u201d is a closed question. It can\nbe answered simply yes or no, and depending on the purpose of your interview, that may be an important insight you\u2019ll want\nto know. But if you want an in-depth answer, a yes\/no question won\u2019t work. Instead, ask more open-ended questions that\nbegin with \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d or \u201cwhat.\u201d These questions give your participant lots of room to explore their thoughts and\nexperiences. For example, instead of \u201cdo you enjoy your job,\u201d you might ask, \u201cWhat does it mean to love your job?\u201d\nTranscribing and Coding the Interview\nAfter you have completed the interview, now it\u2019s time to transcribe it, which means listening to it and writing out exactly what each\nperson in the interview said. The main reason you should transcribe your interview is so you can provide direct quotes from your\nparticipant to use as evidence for claims you make in your essay. This is probably the most time-consuming aspect of your project, so\nmake sure you budget appropriately. Here are three tips for effective transcription:\n1. Listen to the entire interview first. Listening to the interview all the way through before transcribing can help you identify\npauses and the general rhythm of the conversation. It can also help you determine who\u2019s talking at any given moment\/\n2. Come up with a coding system to help you transcribe quickly. As you transcribe, it is important to develop a coding\nsystem so that when you come back to it later you can quickly identify the quotes that you need. Whenever you or the\ninterviewee speaks, for example, write out their name in all caps in the transcription document so that you don\u2019t get mixed up\nwhen you are writing your essay. Also, when you\u2019re typing the words said by each speaker, put their words into paragraphs, or\nsmall chunks, and then whenever they pause or move on to a new thought, start a new paragraph. This will help you keep their\npoints organized so that you know which ones to come back to later. As you\u2019re transcribing, you\u2019ll also want to use ellipses, or\n\u201c\u2026\u201d to indicate pauses or breaks in speech. And, after you\u2019re done transcribing, highlight important points your participant\nmakes, so that you can focus on them in your essay. For example, if you have been creating new paragraphs in your\ntranscription document every time your participant moves on to a new thought or idea, you can highlight certain topics in\nspecific colors. So for example, if you are doing a profile about a person in your community, you may highlight biographical\ninformation they shared with you in red, but use a different color for stories they share about their profession, and so on.\nThen, in your essay, if you want to quote from them, you know which colors to look for in your notes to use.\n3. Make strategic decisions about which portions of the interview you transcribe. You\u2019ll need to be strategic about how\nand whether you transcribe every single utterance they make (\u201cverbatim\u201d) or whether you you edit their words as you\ntranscribe (\u201cnon-verbatim\u201d). For example, when we are just talking to each other out loud, we don\u2019t \u201csound\u201d like we do when\nwe write. Usually when we speak, we use a lot of \u201cums,\u201d or \u201clikes\u201d or \u201cuhs\u201d as we communicate. According to the University\nof Wisconsin Writing Center, these utterances are normal parts of speech: \u201cWe start sentences and then interrupt ourselves and\nnever return to complete those earlier thoughts.\u201d But with writing it\u2019s different. When we write something down, we get to go\nback, edit things, refine ideas, and create a more focused train of thought. Therefore, whenever you\u2019re representing other\npeople\u2019s speech in your writing, you have to decide whether you will transcribe those \u201cums\u201d or whether you\u2019ll edit them out to\nappear more like written speech. This is the difference between \u201cverbatim transcription\u201d and \u201cnon-verbatim transcription.\u201d\nUse verbatim transcription, or writing out exactly what your participant says as they say it (all the filler words, the \u2018likes\u201d and\nthe \u201cuhs\u201d) if your assignment has to do with people\u2019s individual language choices, or if your essay is analyzing or considering\nhow humans use language, or the implications of certain kinds of words, etc. However, you may want to use non-verbatim\ntranscription if you are simply using someone\u2019s experience to make a broader point and you want readers to see a clear and\narticulate representation of the interviewee\u2019s ideas. Whatever you do, the University of Wisconsin Writing Center encourages\nstudent writers to \u201cmake sure that you are being consistent with this choice across your article, paper, report or essay.\u201d Here\u2019s A WRITING STUDIES SCHOLAR TEACHES INTERVIEW-BASED WRITING ASSIGNMENTS | 55\nan example below of the difference between a verbatim and non-verbatim transcription, again from the University of\nWisconsin Writing Center. There is no hard-and-fast rule about which style of transcription is \u201cbest.\u201d It\u2019s all about what you\nare trying to accomplish with the interview and whether you think it\u2019s important the reader knows exactly how they\n\u201csounded\u201d or what their ideas are.\n1. Verbatim transcription: Well, you see, I was [pause] the problem, as I saw it, was more of a, a matter of representation,\nyou know? How can I, like, be the one that\u2019s just out there just declaring the way things are when I\u2019ve not even, like, you\nknow, experiencing the whole process for myself?\n2. Non-verbatim Transcription: The problem, as I saw it, was more a matter of representation. How can I be the one that\u2019s\nout there declaring the way things are when I\u2019ve not even experienced the whole process for myself?\nUsing Interview Data in your Essay\nThe last part of incorporating interview evidence into a college-level writing assignment is to actually write the essay. At this point,\nthe hard part is over: you\u2019ve brainstormed about the purpose and scope of the interview, you contacted and scheduled an interview\nwith your participant, you\u2019ve designed questions tailored to the assignment, and you\u2019ve transcribed the audio of the interview and\ncoded for interesting and worthwhile quotes you hope to use. Now, all you have to do is write up what you discovered. More than\nlikely, your interview assignment will be asking you to make an argument about a topic, or to analyze a particular phenomenon and\nthen support your claims with evidence from your interviews. Even if you\u2019re doing a profile of an individual person, for example,\nyour essay still needs to make some kind of claim or have some kind of common theme using the person\u2019s life story as evidence.\nWhatever the purpose of your assignment, you use an interview source the same way you would use any other source in an essay: to\nback up a claim or a statement that you make. You are the one making the argument, so if you quote from the interview, the quote\nneeds to be in support of a claim you are making, not the other way around. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re doing a profile of a local\nteacher, and you are describing her background. You should begin by contextualizing her background with a summary, and then\nmove in with a direct quote that adds context to that summary. For instance, you might write something like this:\nStacey first became interested in teaching when she was just a little girl. \u201cOne of my earliest memories is teaching my little sister\nhow to tie her shoe,\u201d Stacey recollects.\nThere are two things to notice here. One, the quote isn\u2019t just plopped in, forcing the reader to piece together why it is significant.\nThere is a sentence before the quote that makes a specific point about the person. Second, the quotation doesn\u2019t just repeat the\nstatement made before it either. Instead, the quotation provides first-hand evidence in support of the claim you are making about\nher background. Also notice the verb choice for \u201crecollects\u201d as a way to attribute the quotation. There are lots of phrases for this, like\n\u201cfor example,\u201d \u201caccording to,\u201d \u201cshe said,\u201d \u201cshe described,\u201d etc. Try out a variety of these throughout your essay.\nConclusion\nIncorporating interviews into your writing-based research project is a great way to focus on the experiences of another person and\nto put someone\u2019s life experiences in the context of broader social and cultural issues. But there is a lot of work that goes into the\ninterview-essay before you can even start writing. First, you need to figure out the purpose of your interview. Then, you need to select\nparticipants and design effective questions. After that, you need to actually conduct and then transcribe the interview. And then\nyou can begin writing your essay. By the time you start writing, you will have already spent a considerable amount of time with this\nsubject, which hopefully will help you write and sort through what you want to say.\nMoreover, as you write your essay, you need to make specific claims, statements, or interpretations about the subject of your\ninterview, and utilize their words as evidence to back up your claims (much like you would any other academic source). Begin with an\nintroduction, where you introduce the broader topic of the paper in your own words, and then move into separate paragraphs that\nmake specific points about your interviewee or the broader subject your paper is about. Use quotes from your color-coded interview 56 | A WRITING STUDIES SCHOLAR TEACHES INTERVIEW-BASED WRITING ASSIGNMENTS\ntranscript that \u201cback-up\u201d or provide context to the points you are making in those body paragraphs. Make sure the quotes you choose\ndon\u2019t just repeat what you are writing either. The quotes you choose need to extend, support, or clarify your writing.\nIf you\u2019ve done a good job on your interview-essay, you will come to new ideas, arguments, or insights by putting your own\nwriting in conversation with the quotations of others. Using interview data in your essays can make your writing more exciting and\nengaging. It can also help you make sense of big topics through the very specific experiences of individual people. And as we saw in the\nintroduction of this chapter, the skills you develop conducting interviews will help you in a vast array of other fields, from journalism\nto accounting. Using interviews in your writing classes can also help you develop confidence or expand your personal network. At\nits core, though, conducting interviews for college-level writing assignments is a great way, at least briefly, to walk in somebody else\u2019s\nshoes. By using writing to see the world through somebody else\u2019s eyes, we can think more critically about our world and the diverse\nways everyday people navigate it.\nAbout the Author\nTyler Branson\nUNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO\nhttps:\/\/www.utoledo.edu\/al\/english\/faculty\/branson.html\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/TylerBranson\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tyler-branson-64028650\nDr. Tyler Branson is an assistant professor of English and the associate director of composition at the University of Toledo.

We review the balance\nrequired between storytelling and methodological accuracy, consider the political\/social justice-based significance of such research, 58 | INTERDISCIPLINARY WRITING INSTRUCTORS TEACH AUTOETHNOGRAPHIC CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL\nCONSCIOUSNESS\nand address the challenges this methodology and writing presents. We next distinguish between multiple autoethnographic genres\nand conclude with a step-by-step process for its development and craft.\nPersonal Narratives to Political Insights\nCoined by Hayano (1979), autoethnography is a qualitative research method that originated out of the crisis of representation in the\n1980s (Reed-Danahay, 1997, p. 2). Ellis and Bochner (2016), originators of the method, observe that there is no consensus about its\ndefinition, but Ellis (2004) has flexibly described it as \u201cresearch, writing, story, and method that connect the autobiographical and\npersonal to the cultural, social, and political\u201d (p. xix). As Reed-Danahay (1997) points out, in treating the self as a point of departure,\nautoethnography values self-representation and insider expertise. This contrasts with its progenitor, traditional ethnographic\nresearch, in which scholars adopt the traditional stance of anthropologists, presenting themselves as objective observers of a culture\nforeign to them, implicitly contending that this alleged neutrality grants them greater expertise about that culture\u2019s beliefs, practices,\nand experiences than cultural members (pp. 2-9). In autoethnographic research, researchers curate, narrate, and analyze their own\nexperiences to improve outsiders\u2019 understanding of a community to which they already belong. The result is an approach that affords\nwriters the opportunity and ability to \u201cexamine everyday interpersonal and cultural experiences from the inside out\u201d (Boylan &\nOrbe, 2014, p. 10), placing a premium on storytelling, theory, experiential knowledge, plurality, and multiplicity. This makes space\nfor \u201cways of producing meaningful, accessible, and evocative research grounded in personal experience, research that would sensitize\nreaders to issues of identity politics, to experiences shrouded in silence, and to forms of representation that deepen our capacity to\nempathize with people who are different from us\u201d (Ellis et al., 2011, para. 3).\nAutoethnography meshes creative writing techniques with conventional qualitative research methods to make the argument\nthat, while any review of culture is relative to group dynamics, it can be done, and done well, through an exploration of the\nself (Chang, 2008). To accomplish this task, individual voice is infused with nuance into local, regional, and global dialogues by\nstriking a balance between \u201cintellectual and methodological rigor\u2026and creativity\u201d (Adams et al., 2015). Accordingly, writers rely on\ntechniques like autobiography, narrative inquiry, narrative analysis, performance art, archival work, and meta-ethnographic research.\nThese approaches provide the freedom to \u201cblur the boundaries between humanities and social sciences [to express] concrete lived\nexperience in novel and literary forms [by] depicting local stories and including author\u2019s critical reflections on their lives and writing\nprocess\u201d (Boylan & Orbe, 2014, pp. 9-10). The genre welcomes all stories from all writers but requires the inclusion of context,\ndetail, depth, and evocativeness sufficient for critical interpretation. Per Denzin (2013), \u201cthe emphasis on self, biography, history, and\nexperience must always work back and forth between three concerns: the concerns of performance, of process, and\/or of analysis\u201d (p.\n129): that is, the tale and its telling, the epiphanies and social forms that organize the project, and the interpretation of the tale and\nthe cultural forms that explain and challenge it. Significantly, while the central story should first resonate with the writer, the topics\nand issues addressed must be extrapolatable in order to effectively speak to and address a larger contingent of subjects and audiences.\nThe Self and Social Justice\nAs a genre of academic writing that considers the intersection of the lived experience, communal identity, and sociocultural and\nsocioeconomic variables that influence interaction and communication, autoethnography explores \u201cpeople in the process of figuring\nout what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggle. It is writing and research that strives for social justice\u2026 to make life\nbetter\u201d (Adams et al., 2015, p. 2). Issues of social injustice and\/or inequity are interrogated through day-to-day occurrences often\noverlooked or discarded as normal or natural, that when left unaddressed uphold larger systemic issues related to racism, classism,\nsexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia. The genre decolonizes our modes of knowing. Asking whose voices\nhave been \u201cleft out,\u201d \u201cerased,\u201d and\/or \u201cmarginalized\u201d in academic scholarship, along with \u201cwhose stories were privileged and why,\nand which stories are important and why\u201d in academic and public discourses (Chawla & Atay, 2018, p. 3) interrupts hegemonic INTERDISCIPLINARY WRITING INSTRUCTORS TEACH AUTOETHNOGRAPHIC CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL\nCONSCIOUSNESS | 59\nknowledge structures and legitimizes alternate epistemologies. A self-reflective practice that considers local phenomena within the\ncontext of time, space, and actors, autoethnography encourages visceral texts and performances that recenter minoritized bodies\nand experiences, \u201cshift marginal voices to the center\u201d (Chawla & Atay, 2018, p. 4), and destabilize Western academic knowledge\nproduction. This work aligns directly with Critical Race Theory, as it creates room for \u201ccultural intuition\u201d and diverse stories\nthat speak from and interrogate colonial histories, exposes how institutions are shaped by racism, and challenges the privileging of\nwhiteness and Eurocentric, colonialist ideals in these spaces (Martinez, 2016).\nThis methodological design draws on and overlaps with other academic lenses and paradigms, like feminist, critical race, and queer\ntheories and disability studies. Ettorre (2017) aligned autoethnography with feminist tenets, including its ability to create transitional\nspaces, actively demonstrating how \u201cthe personal is the political,\u201d uphold practices attributed to women, like embodiment, emotion,\nand the arts, and raise oppositional consciousness through revealing precarity (p. 4). Jones (2016) observed that telling queer stories\nis about ascribing legitimacy to identities that become unspeakable, and embodying and enacting change, both of which are key\nto autoethnographic research (p. 8). Additionally, \u201cthrough its empathic form, autoethnography provides a tool to fashion a \u2018non-\ndualistic ontology\u2019 of the mindful body in which emotions play a central role in human experience and cultural scripts of health\nand sickness\u201d (Ettorre, 2017, p. 44) and speak back to medical institutions, making it a useful tool for disability justice. Narrative\ninquiry\/analysis illuminate issues of agency that reflect and form political identities, sensibilities, and responsibilities, central work\nfor feminist and queer theory and disability studies to occupy positions of cultural mediation.\nRecently published autoethnographies display the depth and breadth of this work in addressing inequity to develop a more just\nworld. Carr (2017) focused on the killing of Michael Brown and the subsequent social and racial unrest related to police brutality to\nbetter understand 21st century protest from the perspective of \u201cyoung people who are experiencing these modes of civil resistance\nfor the first time\u201d ( p. 6). Svendby et al. (2018) explored cultural ableism by narrating and analyzing their non-disabled perspectives\nand experiences to critique and challenge the biomedical lenses through which disabled bodies are perceived by the non-disabled\n(p. 225). Miheretu and Henward (2020) used Miheretu\u2019s personal experiences to examine mothers of interracial children who\nidentify as Black to understand the experiences of women who cross color lines as couples and parents. And Holt (2003), Johnston\nand Strong (2008), Wall (2008), Saldana (2014), Forber-Pratt (2015), and Blockmans (2019) have interrogated their experiences as\nqualitative researchers in academia to make visible academic biases about autoethnography and the author\u2019s social location, which\nis \u201calways racialized, classed, gendered\u201d (Martinez, 2016, p. 82) and otherwise embodied. These are only some of the ways in which\nautoethnography has been applied. Our goal in relaying this information isn\u2019t to provide a literature review but rather to show how\nthe method lends itself to writing that explores and challenges prevailing social, cultural, and economic structures.\nIssues of Divulgence and Exposure\nAutoethnography is a personally challenging method, necessitating self-awareness, reflexivity, objective distance, and narrative\nveracity. Researchers must remain vigilant against allowing the self to become overwhelmingly central, marginalizing collective\nexperience. Autoethnography may leave them feeling personally vulnerable, such that they have to quell feelings of defensiveness\nwhen faced with scholarly critique (Ellis et al., 2011). They may incur personal and professional costs in writing about their\nexperiences (Dashper, 2015). It can be difficult to get institutional approval for autoethnography since it challenges traditional forms\nof academic knowledge-making. And its detractors contend that it lacks generalizability and objectivity and is self-indulgent, non-\nrigorous, unethical, and \u2014 due to the fallibility of memory \u2014 inaccurate (Holt, 2003, p. 24).\nMany of these methodological concerns have been addressed by prominent qualitative researchers. Some autoethnographers insist\nautoethnography is about seeking verisimilitude, not precision, and what is generalizable about such research is not the particulars\nof an experience but how it represents a facet of collective experience. Though it\u2019s derided as \u201cnavel-gazing,\u201d autoethnography is\nintrinsically collaborative and polyvocal, as the stories we tell about ourselves are co-constructed with people in our lives. Holman\nJones (2016) addressed the charge that autoethnography lacks theoretical rigor by suggesting, \u201ctheory asks about and explains the\nnuances of an experience and the happenings of a culture; story is the mechanism for illustrating and embodying these nuances 60 | INTERDISCIPLINARY WRITING INSTRUCTORS TEACH AUTOETHNOGRAPHIC CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL\nCONSCIOUSNESS\nand happenings. Because theory and story exist in a mutually influential relationship, theory is not an add-on to story\u201d (p. 229).\nFinally, although issues of relational ethics plague autoethnographic work, other people\u2019s identities can be masked without altering\nthe story\u2019s meaning, and when masked identities may be discoverable, creating composite characters offers further anonymity (Ellis\net al., 2011).\nSome of these issues are subjective. Degrees of personal and professional precarity will affect what scholars choose to disclose in\ntheir research (Dashper, 2015). Member-checking processes, in which characters are asked to assess the credibility of the research,\nmight be impossible or might be comprehensively conducted with reviewers with whom the autoethnographer is intimately\nconnected (Forber-Pratt, 2015). Doing this research for institutional approval comes with risks, as institutional members might\nquestion the project\u2019s validity (Holt, 2003; Dashper, 2015). Autoethnographers should consider their personal and professional\ncircumstances when making these determinations.\nGenres of Autoethnographic Writing\nA capacious, interdisciplinary methodology, autoethnography contains numerous approaches that might be used independently\nof one another or in tandem, including (but not limited to) evocative autoethnography, analytic autoethnography, collaborative\nautoethnography, and performance autoethnography, to name a few. Autoethnography is an orientation to research that prioritizes\nthe craft of writing as much as the research. This writing may take a variety of forms with diverse stylistic features, but it always\ncombines the systematic, empirical methodologies of ethnography with the aesthetic elements of storytelling (Bochner & Ellis, 2016,\np. 67).\nBochner and Ellis (2016) suggest that many of these methods are different types of evocative autoethnography, rather than\nequivalent genres (p. 59). In evocative autoethnography, evocation is a fundamental tool to emotionally move audiences and engage\nquestions of race, gender, sexuality, and social injustice. Analytic autoethnography emphasizes theoretical analysis, perhaps to\nappropriate it into mainstream qualitative research methods. Collaborative autoethnography co-constructs the research story by\ninviting participant accounts of the experience (Ellis et al., 2018). Performance autoethnography recenters embodiment through\nreflective performance (Spry, 2001). These are foundational and influential autoethnographic genres, but they are not the only\nmethods available to researchers. Ultimately, researchers must select the mode of inquiry and writing style that seem best suited to\ntheir research, weaving theoretical prose with narrative strategies to help outsiders better understand the relational practices, value\nsystem, and social logics of the culture through moments that impacted a life trajectory (Ellis et al., 2011).\nAutoethnography permits a certain freedom in both process and product, but \u2014 like all research methodologies \u2014 all of its genres\nadhere to a set of common protocols, regardless of the product\u2019s final form. These conventions are delineated below.\nToward an Autoethnographic Process\n1) The Personal: Mining Memory & Sculpting Scene\nBegin your writing process by mining your memories for significant personal experiences. How do you choose? What stands out as\na moment of transition, change, turning point, or epiphany for you? By choosing a time in your life when you experienced great\nevolution, you are opening up an opportunity to dig into not only how your own personal identity was sculpted, but universal types\nof experiences which are archetypal to all human beings. These moments are likely to resonate with your readers, and will allow you\nto connect to broader social concerns and conversations.\nNow write about your memory and the feelings and beliefs you have associated with it by freewriting for 15-30 minutes.\nFreewriting is a process wherein you write without judgement. Try writing quickly, without stopping to edit or revise. By freewriting, INTERDISCIPLINARY WRITING INSTRUCTORS TEACH AUTOETHNOGRAPHIC CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL\nCONSCIOUSNESS | 61\nyou can achieve a state of flow which connects you to your subconscious, and allows writing to become a process of discovery and\nexcavation, through which you find and investigate hidden understandings and wisdom.\nAfter freewriting on your memory, you will have created a powerful, albeit messy, text. It is likely that you ended in a place that\nyou did not anticipate. Now identify some of your surprising insights. Circle or highlight them and consider them treasures from\nyour excavation process. These are not only personal revelations, but cultural ones. Take for example a personal realization about\nthe divisions of labor within your household: how might you connect this conversation to broader concerns about gender, race, and\nclass?\nTake this block of text and render it into a scene. A scene is a captured moment, played out in real time for your reader to\nobserve. In the exercise above, you will have brought to light many of the compelling ideas and considerations related to your\npersonal experience. By turning these subjects into a scene, you embody these ideas. In this way readers can witness these moments for\nthemselves, and thus be allowed to evaluate, be changed by, and feel the weight of that moment. Scene is an important tool in giving\nyour reader this power. Choose a scene that shows you in interaction with the outside world, either through dialogue or action,\nletting the reader see and understand both your interior and exterior experiences.\n2) Fieldnotes: Further Excavations, Finding Personal Artifacts\nIn the field of anthropology, historically, ethnography has relied on fieldnotes to provide evidence for readers. Ethnographic\nfieldnotes are recordings of what the ethnographer has witnessed. Fieldnotes offer the reader an opportunity to view the world\nthrough the gaze and lens of the ethnographer. For this reason, they are subjective evidence, colored by the beliefs, ideas, and views of\nthe writer. This is why ethnographers often collect other evidence of their time \u201cin the field\u201d\u2014to add context and to provide a more\nobjective image and understanding. Sometimes these are other recordings like photographs or video; sometimes objects like money,\ncalendars, receipts, or maps; and sometimes written correspondences that include other voices, like letters, emails, or text messages.\nAt this point, to fulfill the process of member-checking, refer to the Issues of Divulgence and Exposure section.\nOne of the richest opportunities we have as autoethnographers is the freedom to create multimodal texts. This means that when\nwe research our own lives the evidence we provide can be a fascinating mix of materials which document our realities. In what ways\nhave you recorded your life? What kinds of fieldnotes and evidence might you be able to include in order to give your reader a more\ndetailed view of the world you are situated within?\na) How to Decide\u2014Evaluating Materials:\nThink about the value of the various kinds of fieldnotes you might include, and what additional perspective they offer. In the digital\nage, we often take for granted how much of our lives is recorded and preserved. Since you have so many to choose from, make choices\nbased on what details and layers you can add to your work that couldn\u2019t be achieved otherwise. When you read through your memory\nscene, what feels like it\u2019s missing? Fieldnotes can be a way to add richness to your setting.\nb) How to Curate & Organize\u2014Composition of Materials\nNow that you have gathered fieldnotes, how will you present them? It\u2019s important to consider the significance of the organization of\nthese materials. You may decide to embed them throughout the body of your written work, adding a photograph to the scene you\ndescribe, for example. You also might decide to make a collage, grid, template, or map. Think about how these different presentations\nimpact the experience of your reader. Think of this process as building the scaffolding for an idea. How will the architecture change\nthe way your reader interprets the information? 62 | INTERDISCIPLINARY WRITING INSTRUCTORS TEACH AUTOETHNOGRAPHIC CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n3) Creating a Narrative\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with the traditional plot structure and story arc we all learn in high school: first the rising action, then\nthe climax, then the denouement, and then the resolution. Is this the shape of the story you\u2019ve told? While all stories are different\n\u201cshapes,\u201d this traditional diagram is helpful for thinking through what keeps readers engaged and satisfied. Look back at your\nmemory, scene, and fieldnotes. What order allows your reader to experience tension and resolution?\n4) Meaning Making: Reflection and Analysis\nOnce you have decided how you will present your fieldnotes and the order to your story, it\u2019s time to reflect on and analyze your work.\nLook through and meditate on your materials. What new revelations become apparent? How have initial insights evolved?\n5) Making it Larger: The Individual to the Universal\nNow that you have discovered your own personal story, consider how it connects to the experiences of others. This last part of the\nprocess is all about drawing out these connections. Try diagramming, concept mapping, or freewriting to discover this last element.\nAsk yourself, if this story were a fable, what would be the lesson?\nConclusion\nAutoethnography is a process of turning your gaze within and onto the outside world. We have included here one approach\nand process for writing your own autoethnography, but the nature of this type of writing encourages experimentation. Consider\nrearranging, playing with, and adding new elements. Most importantly, autoethnography is a genre of discovery, of the self, culture,\nand ideas. There are infinite ways to find oneself and one\u2019s voice through writing, and to make that writing significant to a broader\ncultural context. In order to begin that process, consider the questions below.\nQuestions\n1. How have personal events affected or shaped your academic writing and research?\n2. What academic opportunities have you been afforded to consider who you are as a person and\/or writer, and how those\nidentities are shaped by social, cultural, and economic factors?\n3. What lived experiences have most directly impacted your individual sense of self?\n4. How were these experiences reflective of larger systemic issues?\n5. If you were to write about one of these experiences, why would your story resonate with readers, and how could it possibly\naffect social change?\nReferences\nAdams, T., Holman Jones, S., Ellis, C.

Some\nexamples might include working with fifth graders on writing narrative and persuasive essays, helping adults work on resumes and\njob application materials at a local family crisis services center, or working with a local high school to open a writing center.\nService learning gives you the opportunity to fully participate in a project with others in the community, and learn in a hands-\non way that you may not otherwise be able to do in a traditional composition classroom. These projects can be very meaningful,\nsince you are building relationships with community members, learning about them and the issues they face, and taking what you\nlearn to help benefit the community and also yourself (Flower, 2008). It is an opportunity to work with and learn from people A WRITING CENTER ADMINISTRATOR TEACHES SERVICE LEARNING | 67\nwho may be similar or different from you, and learn from those differences. As Flower (2008) states \u201cIn community-based service\nlearning projects, one uses the role of student, mentor, teacher, researcher, or activist to move beyond the academy and form working\nrelationships across differences of race, class, culture, gender, age, status, or discourse\u201d (p. 3). Moving beyond the academy entails\nlearning outside of the college classroom, and being actively involved in the community where we will work side by side with\ncommunity members.\nWhen utilizing service learning in your first year composition course, your writing and actions inform each other. Actions within\nthe community partnership develop critical thinking skills by forcing you to think more deeply about your writing topic, and your\nwriting helps you process your thoughts and adapt your practices within the partnership to better work with participants. Your\nwriting also has practical applications that you and your community partner can put to use, to continually improve the partnership\nand ultimately help serve the community participants in increasingly beneficial ways.\nFor the purpose of this chapter, I will be using the community of Stillwater as an example, and drawing from service learning\nprojects I\u2019ve been involved in with the Oklahoma State University Writing Center, as well as a research project where I interviewed\nour community partners to get their perspectives on partnerships with the Writing Center and other OSU departments. While we\nare talking in this chapter about writing as part of your composition class, the examples from the Writing Center are the same types\nof projects you can participate in as a composition student, and several of the interview excerpts with community partners are also in\nreference to other OSU partnerships they have, including those with specific classes.\nImportant Components of Service Learning\nIntentional Kindness\nAnother way to think of service learning is as kindness in action. And not just kindness in the sense of being nice to someone, but\nas Boquet (2015) states, \u201cKindness, however, is really a habit, an orientation, something we practice and, indeed, can become better\nat. Kindness is something we practice in relation to community, and some kindnesses are not associated with any one individual but\nwith a sense of collective purpose\u201d (p. 25-26). We can be intentional in our kindness through action in service learning, in making\nsure we know what the community partner\u2019s goals are, that we are working in a way that benefits those we are working with, and\ncreating that mutual respect with the partners.\nGoldblatt (2007) emphasizes another aspect of the importance of intentionality: \u201cAnd if one pursues a vision of writing or literacy\ninstruction that goes beyond the campus, indeed beyond the curriculum, there is all the more reason to understand that program\nin its very specific locale, based on the kinds of students in the university, the economic climate of the region, the state of the public\nand private schools in the area, and many other crucial considerations, both contemporary and historical\u201d (p. 9). As an example\nusing the city of Stillwater, the community has about a third of the population living below the poverty level (United States Census\nBureau (2019), and about 41% of the children in the local public school district qualify for the free and reduced lunch program (Neal\nas qtd by Bitton (2018). So in evaluating this, we can think about the program at the children\u2019s museum in town which charges\nan admission cost, versus the public library, where the programs are free. And even more so, the programs at the actual schools\nthemselves, where students already are and have transportation to and from school.\nAnother example that one of our interviewees, Joy, gave was that, because time during school is already jam packed with needed\ncurriculum, and after school programs make it difficult for students who are bus riders, an interested volunteer program instituted\na reading buddies program during breakfast time, which is when the bus riders and other early arrivers would be there and before\nschool starts: \u201cThere is this little window of time, when they\u2019re eating breakfast\u2026 [when] they are able to sit with their reading buddy\nand read and eat a breakfast. So we really are able to catch those kids because those same kids wouldn\u2019t be able to stay after school\nmost likely\u201d (Joy, interview). So for this particular school in Stillwater, that breakfast time \u201ccould be a real avenue to get some of those\nkiddos that we wouldn\u2019t be able to reach after school\u201d (Joy, interview). If we are being intentional about planning a time when many\nof the students from lower socioeconomic homes are going to be at school, will work with teacher schedules and not take time from 68 | A WRITING CENTER ADMINISTRATOR TEACHES SERVICE LEARNING\nnecessary instruction, plus making sure transportation isn\u2019t an issue for students, this breakfast time frame is a way to intentionally\nplan a service learning project with the school.\nRespect\nOne of the most important components of service learning is the attitude we have when meeting the community partners, and\ntalking with them about what we will be working on together. Our community partners are immersed in the community and are in\ntouch with both the strengths and needs of the community. They are the community experts, if you will, and fully equal partners.\nAs Flower (2008) states, \u201cteaching ourselves to see and affirm the deep springs of agency in others is a prerequisite to a dialogue\u201d (p.\n200). To truly have a productive conversation based in respect, we need to view our community partners as having valuable input and\ninsights.\nWhat I mean by respect not only has to do with our view of the community partners, but in how we interact and treat them, and\nsetting goals with them, rather than for them. We will want to have a meeting with the partners ahead of time to make sure that the\nplans for the service learning project will be beneficial for everyone. Rousculp (2014), who writes about a rhetoric of respect, says this:\n\u201cEngaging within a rhetoric of respect draws attention to how we use language in relation with others: how we name and classify,\nhow we collaborate, how we problem-solve. Whereas respect itself may exist as a feeling, a rhetoric of respect requires discursive\naction\u201d (p. 25). So respect is more than a feeling, and includes us having a conversation between equals, where we actually act on the\ninformation and feedback from our community partners.\nIn an interview with one of our community partners, Earl, he says it this way, in regards to collaboration between the public\nschools and OSU: \u201cAll parent engagement stuff these days tells you that if you really want parents engaged, then you really don\u2019t\nwant them to come to you as you\u2019re the parent, I\u2019m the teacher, you know nothing about your child\u2019s education, I know everything.\n[Instead] You are going to spend half the day with the child, so you know stuff about your child that I need to know in order\nto make this work, and I have stuff to share with you that\u2019s going to help. And if we do this as a collaboration between the two\nof us, and not that I\u2019m the educational god then good things happen. But if you don\u2019t approach it that way, it doesn\u2019t work as\nsmoothly as it should\u201d (Earl, interview). Earl reiterates here what Flower and Rousculp tell us. If we are going to engage in a service\nlearning partnership in our community, we need to treat it as a true collaboration, and listen to our partners with their insights and\nperspectives, and come to an agreement together on what the service learning components will entail by mediating the relationship\nthrough respect.\nBeneficial for Both Researcher and Community Partner\nThe work you do with the community partner will help you gain a more in depth and meaningful understanding into a community,\nbut it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that the partner institution\u2019s needs are just as important as your learning. Goldblatt (2007)\npoints out, \u201cTo partner with schools and community organizations, a postsecondary institution must be clear about its self-interests\nand the interests of its partners; it must be willing to negotiate with partners over the direction of a project in a way that benefits\nall participants\u201d (p. 6). And as Royster (1996) states, \u201cIt seems to me that the agreement for inquiry and discovery needs to be\ndeliberately reciprocal\u201d (p. 33). In collaborative projects, our ideas and objectives will take shape when we meet and refine them with\nthe community partners. The project may change somewhat and look different than we initially imagined it, but our definitions of\nsuccess and achievement need to be from meeting both groups\u2019 goals and respecting the needs of all.\nEarl put it succinctly when he brought up, \u201cI guess my thought is, when someone wants to do research in the [public] schools,\nand we don\u2019t necessarily always have the best attitudes towards everyone that\u2019s at the university either, so everyone needs to have an\nopen mind and sit down and go, what is it that we need to accomplish, what can we do that has a mutual goal, and then accomplish\nthat, whatever that may be\u201d (Earl, interview). One example of a way we can do this is by designing our service learning project goals to\nintersect with what our community partners are doing as well. So if you\u2019re working with fifth graders on writing essays and want to\nsee how effective different strategies are, and the classroom is focused on writing a persuasive essay with evidence, then gearing your A WRITING CENTER ADMINISTRATOR TEACHES SERVICE LEARNING | 69\nstrategies around writing a persuasive essay will not only help the fifth graders by having multiple levels of scaffolding, but will also\nhelp the teachers by giving students more focused practice on what they are learning in class. Joy said it this way: \u201cI think as much as\npossible, asking us what will help us too. . . it is a challenge to give up time, so any time we can align what we need with what you all\nneed I think that\u2019s the most beneficial\u201d (Joy, interview). This view of reciprocity also directly ties in with intentionality, as tying in\nwith both groups\u2019 needs will in turn be beneficial for participants.\nMindfulness of Difference\nOur kindness and listening are only the first steps in this mutually beneficial partnership based on respect. Many times, we may\nwork with people from different backgrounds, countries, cultures, races, etc, than ourselves. Our service learning experience is an\nopportunity for us to learn from people different from ourselves, about their history, their perspective, and to broaden our own\nperspectives. Truly interacting with and becoming part of a community includes caring about that community, and becoming\ninvested in work to help change injustices and work for equitable treatment. For example, when working with community members\nfrom marginalized groups, such as students of color, Garcia (2017) states that: \u201cin resisting the retrofitting and\/or reductionism of\nstudents of color, I focus on cultivating a mindfulness of difference by describing the geo, body, and mobile politics of knowledge\nthat students\u2026 carry with them. In these ways, listening is functional and operational towards actional and decolonial work\u201d (p. 33).\nWhile Garcia is specifically talking about a writing center, this idea very much applies to composition classrooms, as well. What kind\nof listening can we do with our community partners, and what should we see in our actions as a result of this listening? Part of our\nintentionality and respect is letting people be themselves, and valuing their experiences, their knowledge, and respecting their right\nto speak for themselves and what they think instead of what we think they are saying and who we think they are.\nAs an example, Royster (1996), a Black professor of English, speaks of some of her experiences when partnering with others. She\npoints out some of the disrespectful ways in which she has been treated, and gives us an idea of how our treatment of others may\nundermine our partnerships: \u201cWhat am I compelled to ask when veils seem more like walls is who has the privilege of speaking first?\nHow do we negotiate the privilege of interpretation? When I have tried to fulfill my role as negotiator, I have often walked away\nknowing that I have spoken, but also knowing, as Anna Julia Cooper knew in 1892, that my voice, like her voice, is still a muted one.\nI speak, but I cannot be heard. Worse, I am heard but I am not believed. Worse yet, I speak but I am not deemed believable\u201d (p. 36). A\nmindfulness of difference not only includes being respectful of differences, but also being aware of some of the subconscious biases\nwe may have, and being intentional about fully respecting our community partners and participants who may be different than us,\nand making sure we are actually taking them as an expert and hearing and valuing what they say.\nHow a Service Learning Project Works\nWriting a Multivoiced Inquiry (Flower, 2008, p. 230-232)\nFrame a Question\nTake time to think through what you are interested in learning about and investigating in regards to the people and program you are\nworking with. Look up information about the partner organization before meeting with them so that you have an idea about the\npopulation and what types of activities the community partner is engaged in. Meet with the community partner to hear from them,\nand find out their thoughts on the work they do and the people in their community who they work with. Then you\u2019ll be ready to\nformulate your research questions with the community partner to make sure they are mutually beneficial.\nBring Multiple Voices to the Table\nWhen planning your project, \u201cdesign a research plan that collects interpretations and analyses of your problem from at least three 70 | A WRITING CENTER ADMINISTRATOR TEACHES SERVICE LEARNING\ndifferent kinds of participants, sources, or perspectives\u201d (Flower, 2008, p. 231). Three is not a fixed number, but the objective is to\nhave multiple voices and perspectives.\nWith my project, I interviewed people from multiple organizations we partner with, people in diverse positions in those\norganizations (for example, an administrator, a principal, and a teacher at a local public school). I did not interview parents\nor students\/participants, though, which would be a helpful and valuable perspective. Additionally, I read applicable pieces in\ncomposition and rhetoric, as well as writing center studies, on community partnerships and service learning. I supplemented these\nwith personal observations from participating in community engagement projects myself with the OSU Writing Center.\nReflect Multiple Voices in Your Text\nIn addition to listening to multiple voices when you are doing your research, make sure to include those various voices in your project.\nFor example, in this text that you are reading, I draw from multiple community partners, service learning and rhetoric scholars, and\nmy experiences.\nMethods for Working with Intercultural Inquiry (Flower, 2008)\nFor the methods you use for working on your project, Flower suggests utilizing: working with texts, observations, interviews, and\ndialogues (Flower, 2008, p. 237-240). As an example, for interviews, you will want to think about how you would record the\ninterview, if you want to have a structured or semi-structured interview, and if you would want to transcribe the entire interview or\nfocus on parts that you found most helpful. Another thing to keep in mind is that if you plan to publish or present information\nabout your project at a conference (as well as any project that involves human subjects), you will need to get permission from the\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) at your institution.\nIn addition to the practical aspects, we also need to think about how we enact those methods. As Garcia points out, \u201cAt the center\nof this design should be a new, not merely renewed, practice of listening: listening as a form of understanding and action\u201d (p. 51).\nOne way we truly listen to our community partners and participants is by changing our own actions and practices based on what\nwe are learning from our partners. Our methods should be changing as we go about our project, as we work to incorporate those\nmultiple voices, both in our text we create and in the way we are working with our community partners.\nAs a final note, we need to keep in the forefront of our minds that we are working with actual people, and that our actions can have\nlong term effects. Aja Martinez, a Mexican-American English professor at the University of North Texas, talks about her experiences\ngrowing up, and how she was treated\/perceived when she was a student, and how those various interactions influenced how she saw\nherself. Martinez (2016) recounts how she started out as a child seeing herself as a writer, but later, through interactions with various\nteachers, began to question that identity, including a professor who gave her a B+++++ but said that because she was a not a native\nEnglish speaker (which, in fact, Martinez actually is a native English speaker) that she wouldn\u2019t be able to write to a certain level.\nOur interactions with participants in our service learning project can have a major impact on participants, whether positive or\nnegative, and so we need to keep in mind kindness and a mindfulness of difference, as well as being positive and helping empower\nparticipants when we interact. The service learning project you participate in should benefit you as a writer, your community\npartners, and ultimately, the participants you are working with.\nTips\n\u2022 Be aware of deadlines with potential partners, for example, Stillwater\u2019s local school district only takes applications twice a year\nfor staff to be involved in IRB research projects with OSU.\n\u2022 Do some research to see what departments on campus you could collaborate with who already have established community\npartnerships. This is one way to make sure that those community relationships are consistent even though students come and\ngo. A WRITING CENTER ADMINISTRATOR TEACHES SERVICE LEARNING | 71\n\u2022 Go to the correct contact for the organization \u2013 for example, Stillwater Public Schools has a SPS liaison for all OSU\npartnerships.\n\u2022 Make sure to prioritize student safety, and let them know they can come to you if any issue arises with the community partner.\n\u2022 Work with your FYC director to make sure it is approved and the partnerships will continue even when you are no longer\nteaching comp\n\u2022 Note: Be ethical\/accurate in how you reflect your project and what comes from it. One of the community partners told me\nbefore recording the interview, and showed me on a website, of a partner who misquoted the community partners and the\nquotes painted participants in a negative light. This damaged the community partner\u2019s relationship with participants. These\ncommunity relationships are built on trust, and it\u2019s important to not take advantage of that by exaggerating in order to make\nour projects look better.\n\u2022 On the other hand, if something negative has happened, you should be honest about that, too. Issues can happen with\ncommunity partners. If you encounter anything troubling or that makes you uncomfortable, contact your instructor or the\nFYC director and go from there.\n\u2022 Always be prepared to revise your goals and plans based on what you are learning as you participate in the project.\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 Thinking of Boquet\u2019s definition of intentional kindness that \u201cKindness, however, is really a habit, an orientation, something\nwe practice and, indeed, can become better at. Kindness is something we practice in relation to community, and some\nkindnesses are not associated with any one individual but with a sense of collective purpose\u201d (p. 25-26), what strategies could\nyou utilize to foster a partnership based on the principles of intentional kindness and mutual respect?\n\u2022 What steps can we take to cultivate listening with empathy and planning out our service learning project collaboratively with\ncommunity partners?\n\u2022 Before meeting with your community partners: Think about your potential partners and what questions you will want to ask\nin order to gain the information needed to be intentional and create a mutually beneficial partnership. What are other\nresources you can consult to prepare for the meeting? For example, if you are in Stillwater and planning to work with the\npublic school district, you could look at the Stillwater Public Schools website in advance, and the city of Stillwater\u2019s\ninformation on the population and demographics as a starting point to learn about the community and population.\n\u2022 After you\u2019ve completed your service learning project, reflect on how successful you were on incorporating intentional kindness\nand listening. What changes would you make for future partnerships?\nSpecial thanks to Salman Rafique for the thoughtful feedback and productive discussions in writing center sessions for this chapter.\nReferences\nBoquet, E.

It will also\nprovide instructions for an easy and organic process to create these paragraphs, and it will discuss the basics of in-text\ncitation for quotations and paraphrases. The goal of this chapter is to help you think about developing your body\nparagraphs as the primary task of your writing process. Following these instructions will help you think about writing as\na process\u2014not a product\u2014and will help you tailor a process-based approach to writing that will work for you\nthroughout college.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Modular Approach to writing\n\u2022 Rhetorical Situation\n\u2022 Close Reading\nIn this chapter I will propose a method for organizing paragraphs that is built on the foundation of a modular approach to\nwriting essays. By modular approach, I simply mean one that develops the components of the papers as modules, focusing on\ncontent development first and on sequencing later. This new way of writing\u2014and thinking about writing\u2014contrasts the mindset\nthat attempts to write an essay straight through from introduction to conclusion. The \u201cstraight through\u201d approach suited our needs\nin high school, but we will find it unsustainable at the college level. In contrast, our new modular approach can be used to write\npapers of any length and scope.\nIn this modular approach, paragraphs develop organically out of the loci of your interest identified in your research. I suggest\ndeveloping all body paragraphs simultaneously from the prewrite stage through to the final draft by first establishing the topics of 74 | A LITERATURE SCHOLAR TEACHES STRUCTURING PARAGRAPHS IN A RESEARCH ESSAY\nyour paragraphs, then determining your paragraphs\u2019 informational component, and finally moving on to the rhetorical aspect of your\nparagraphs. This method of constructing paragraphs is meant to help you develop the five components of every good paragraph:\n1. Topic sentence\n2. Relate topic back to thesis\n3. Observation (Can be multiple sentences)\n4. Analysis (Can be multiple sentences)\n5. Transition\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/open.library.okstate.edu\/whoteacheswriting\/?p=35#h5p-4\nAddressing Our New Rhetorical Situation\nIn high school, the dominant rhetorical situation\u2014the context within which we communicate\u2014that shaped our writing training\nwas the standardized test. When we write for a standardized test, we often create a hasty outline and write straight through the paper\nfrom introduction to conclusion. This method suits composition within the time constraints of standardized testing but ultimately\nsacrifices depth and clarity of elocution as a byproduct. When we make this compromise, we tend to be less satisfied with the work\nwe have created, and sometimes this taints our experience of writing so that we might assume we don\u2019t like to do it. As we shift into\na different rhetorical situation\u2014writing research essays in college\u2014we should also shift our approach to fit that new context. The\nmethod that I propose here is meant to help us think about the writing process differently, help us organize effective paragraphs in\nour new rhetorical situation, and\u2014hopefully, as a result\u2014feel more satisfied with our writing. A LITERATURE SCHOLAR TEACHES STRUCTURING PARAGRAPHS IN A RESEARCH ESSAY | 75\nWe can more easily develop an effective body paragraph if we don\u2019t try to write it all at once, straight through from first sentence\nto last. Effective body paragraphs are constructed so that each component fulfills one of a variety of objectives. As we have seen, there\nare five primary components that each paragraph should contain. Each of these should achieve its own objective. Our task becomes\ncumbersome if we try to switch between these five different mindsets continually while we work through our paper from first word\nto last. Instead, I suggest focusing on one task at a time. The first task of writing any paragraph is to choose what your paragraph\nwill be about. This ordinarily begins with identifying evidence and developing ideas while in the research stage. By writing down this\nevidence and your ideas you begin to create the informational component of your body paragraphs.\nInformational Component\nWhen we write a paragraph, we need to break our overarching task into its constitutive elements. To do so, begin by developing\nthe informational component of your paragraph before moving on to the rhetorical components. The informational component of\nyour paragraph can be broken down into two subcategories: 1. The observation, and 2. The analysis. First, we will address the\nobservational aspect. This observation can be either an original idea, a quotation from the text, or a paraphrase of information found\nin the text. The process I will outline here is general and meant to apply to paragraphs that include quotations as well as those that\ndo not. Remember that we are building paragraphs from the inside out, so once your body paragraph is completed, this observation\n(written first) will be found towards the middle of the paragraph. When we build paragraphs from the inside out, around the key\nobservation that you have made, we ensconce that observation at the center of the paragraph. 76 | A LITERATURE SCHOLAR TEACHES STRUCTURING PARAGRAPHS IN A RESEARCH ESSAY\nWith my students I like to use a rather silly mixed metaphor to convey this point. Think of your observation, quote, or\nparaphrase as a beautiful jewel ensconced in an opulent setting. One cannot immediately or easily remove the jewel\nand make sense of the setting on its own. This contrasts to the sloppy and haphazard way we sometimes add a\nquote to a paragraph as an afterthought: like a pepperoni slapped onto a frozen cheese pizza. The cheese does little\nto prevent us from removing the topping and, though delicious, the pizza still makes sense without the pepperoni.\nWe want to create paragraphs that are like diamond rings and not pepperoni pizzas. I did mention it was a silly\ncomparison, but it conveys the notion that is important here: build your paragraphs around the information that is\nessential to your paragraph and to your thesis. When we think about it this way, it just makes sense to compose that\ninformation (your observation) first. \u2013RS\nAs mentioned above, the informational component is best developed organically out of prewriting and then outlining. This\ndoesn\u2019t need to be a formal pre-write, but rather a sketch of the loci of your interests identified while researching your topic. When\nwe pay attention to our thoughts, we can notate the ideas that arise organically as we follow the path of our interests through\nour attention to the material we are studying. Eventually, we will realize our thesis organically by observing the thoughts we think\nwhile researching our topic. We can also identify quotations that buttress the ideas we are developing. Documenting both of these\ncategories\u20141. Our original ideas and 2. Useful quotations\/concepts to paraphrase\u2014on our pre-write determines the kernels of our\nfuture paragraphs and saves a ton of time in the long run. The time I refer to here is that dreaded time spent staring at a blank page\nwith a flashing cursor. Using this method, one should never have to waste time staring at a blank page with a flashing cursor again.\nNow that you\u2019ve sketched out you pre-write, including your thoughts and evidence gathered from the text, I suggest transcribing\nyour observations one at a time into a fresh word document. After each transcribed idea, quotation, or paraphrase, hit enter four\nor five times. You now have the skeleton of your paper, around which you will develop your paragraphs. Technically, you have\ncreated an outline out of your pre-write, but using this method it feels more like an organic evolution than an artificial construction.\nStarting in this way ensures that each paragraph is organized around one idea. This fresh word document is the foundation of\nyour entire paper. You will notice that working this way entirely circumvents the loathsome blank page with flashing cursor. Write\nyour observation or paraphrase into complete sentences or transcribe your quotation precisely and you have completed your body\nparagraph\u2019s observational component. Save your word document (here, throughout, and frequently) and step away from your\ncomputer for some relaxation. When you return to your computer you will approach your next task, the analytical component of\nyour body paragraphs. We will turn to the analytical component in a moment, but first, let\u2019s address the formal expectations for\nincluding a quote or paraphrase as your observation.\nA note on embedding quotations and paraphrases: the basics\nWhen the observation in your paragraph takes the form of a quotation or a paraphrase, it is customary to provide a\nshort introduction to the idea that is not your own. To do so, we use a signal phrase that shows your audience that\nthe following idea isn\u2019t yours. The simplest and most effective way to do this is to introduce the creator of that idea.\nThough this is only necessary in a paragraph that includes a quotation or paraphrase, in those instances it is essential\nto extend this professional courtesy to the originator of the idea you are discussing. Each quote or paraphrase also\nneeds to include an embedded citation. In the current MLA citation style, that takes the form of a parenthetical A LITERATURE SCHOLAR TEACHES STRUCTURING PARAGRAPHS IN A RESEARCH ESSAY | 77\ncitation after the close of the quotation marks\u2014or at the end of the paraphrase\u2014but before the closing punctuation.\nIf you choose not to introduce the originator of the idea you\u2019re quoting, you must include their last name in the\nparenthesis, along with the page number of the quote. If you have introduced the author, you may omit their name\nand only include the page number in your parenthesis. Below is an example using the first sentence of this\nparagraph:\nAs Ryan Slesinger writes in \u201cA Literature Scholar Teaches Structuring Paragraphs in a Research Essay,\u201d \u201cWhen the\nobservation in your paragraph takes the form of a quotation or a paraphrase, it is customary to provide a short\nintroduction to the idea that is not your own\u201d (#).\nThere are different formatting requirements if you choose to include a longer quotation: more than four lines of prose\nor three lines of poetry. At that length, you would format your quotation as a block quote. To do so, write out your\nquotation in its entirety, then highlight it and indent it \u00bd inch from the left margin. The quote remains double spaced\nlike the rest of your essay. Your parenthetical citation occurs outside of the final punctuation in this case. See the\nbelow example:\nAs Ryan Slesinger writes in, \u201cA Literature Scholar Teaches Structuring Paragraphs in a Research Essay,\u201d\nWhen the observation in your paragraph takes the form of a quotation or a paraphrase, it is customary to\nprovide a short introduction to the idea that is not your own. To do so, we use a signal phrase that shows\nyour audience that the following idea isn\u2019t yours. The simplest and most effective way to do this is to\nintroduce the creator of that idea. (#)\nBe judicious about your quote selection and try to limit your block quote inclusions. Remember that your audience is\nmore interested in what you have to say about your topic than what your sources have to say. These basics of in-text\ncitation should suffice for the purpose of your composition classes, but there is a lot more to learn about appropriate\ncitation methods, including several other styles in addition to MLA. The Purdue OWL website is the go-to resource\nfor all citation styles. If you need more clarification, owl.purdue.edu should be your first stop.\nAnalytical Component\nThe next step is to add your analytical component to each observation. Where the observation in each paragraph anchors that\nparagraph to the text in question, the analytical component provides commentary on why you\u2019ve chosen to include the observation\nto support your thesis. Often when studying a text, this analytical component will take the form of what we in literary studies call\na \u201cclose reading.\u201d Close readings pay special attention to the literary elements of a text, including the word choice, imagery, tone,\netc. Depending on the field and focus of your research you should create appropriate analyses. For instance, if you have provided a\nstatistic, perhaps your analytical component will interpret the statistic for a general (non-specialist) audience. Regardless of which\nfield you\u2019re working in, the pattern is the same. The informational aspect of a paragraph is composed of your observation and\nanalysis. No paragraph is complete without both. The proportion of both is important as well.\nOur analytical component is the most important part of any body paragraph. But sometimes as writers we assume that our readers\nare on a wavelength with us and they intuitively understand why we\u2019ve chosen to include our evidence\/observation. This is not\nalways the case. As a teacher of first year writing over the last fifteen years, I\u2019ve seen many students fall into this trap. Remember that\nyour audience (and in college, your instructor) cannot read your mind, and is ultimately most interested in what you have to say\nabout your topic. So, when you\u2019re choosing a quote, it should provide important information for your argument, but should not 78 | A LITERATURE SCHOLAR TEACHES STRUCTURING PARAGRAPHS IN A RESEARCH ESSAY\nstand alone within the context of your essay. Each paragraph should contain at least as much analysis as observation, and analysis\nshould frequently outweigh observation in each paragraph. These are quantitative measures, but you should try to balance your\nparagraphs between analysis and observation. If an imbalance occurs, make sure that the scale tilts towards an excess of analysis. Your\nanalysis is really the meat of your paragraph, and thus the meat of your essay.\nDO \ud83d\udc4f NOT \ud83d\udc4f FOLLOW \ud83d\udc4f SOMEONE \ud83d\udc4f WHO \ud83d\udc4f HATES \ud83d\udc4f YOU \ud83d\udc4f INTO \ud83d\udc4f THE \ud83d\udc4f WINE \ud83d\udc4f CELLAR \ud83d\udc4f ON\n\ud83d\udc4f THE \ud83d\udc4f PROMISE \ud83d\udc4f OF \ud83d\udc4f A \ud83d\udc4f FINE \ud83d\udc4f VINTAGE \ud83d\udc4f\n\u2014 SparkNotes (@SparkNotes) April 9, 2019\nFortunately, our new modular method of composition creates a failsafe that helps us avoid the temptation of dropping in stand-\nalone quotes: those pepperonis slapped on top of a frozen pizza. When we finished gathering our observational component of the\nessay, we created a document that serves as the backbone of our essay, including each observation\/quote\/paraphrase with four to five\nspaces in between. Our task now is to add our own commentary to that evidence. Move through the outline document adding your\noriginal, analytical thoughts to each of your observations, and before you know it, your analytical component will be complete.\nBecause each observational component is standing alone in this outline document, it is easy to make sure we add analysis to each\nquotation\/paraphrase, and it is easy to make sure our analysis is balanced with\u2014or outweighs\u2014our observational component of\neach paragraph. We will also find that, since we are focusing on each type of task independently, and we have already completed our\nresearch and observations, our analytical thoughts come to us quicker. All we must do is write them down. Once you have added\nyour own original thoughts to each observational component, you have completed the analytical component, and composed the\ninformational component of your body paragraphs. Save the draft and walk away from the computer for a bit. When you return, we\nwill switch gears entirely to the rhetorical component of each paragraph.\nRhetorical Component\nOnce you\u2019ve added analytical comments to each observation, you have written most of each paragraph. That is, you have covered the\ninformational component. Now it\u2019s time to turn to the rhetorical component. The rhetorical component frames your informational\ncomponent and serves to contextualize the observations and analysis you have chosen to present to your audience. As you might\nexpect from my phrase \u201cframing,\u201d the rhetorical component goes before and after the informational. You have three rhetorical\ntasks to complete in every paragraph:\n1. Introduce your topic\n2. Relate topic back to thesis\n3. Transition to next paragraph\nOnce composed, the first two rhetorical aspects will be positioned before your informational component and the third will conclude A LITERATURE SCHOLAR TEACHES STRUCTURING PARAGRAPHS IN A RESEARCH ESSAY | 79\neach paragraph. One might notice that these tasks are relatively simple and easy to compose in contrast to the informational\ncomponent of the paragraphs. However, the rhetorical tasks are crucial for your argument. Think of it this way: the informational\ncomponent tells what you have to say, and the rhetorical elements tell us why what you\u2019re saying is important for your argument.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/open.library.okstate.edu\/whoteacheswriting\/?p=35#h5p-5\nWhen working in our modular system, composing the rhetorical element of body paragraphs is even more accelerated than adding\nanalysis to your observations. Again, I recommend going through these three components one at a time and saving your developing\ndocument after each one. First, go to each pairing of observation + analysis and add a topic sentence that informs the reader of the\ntopic being discussed in that pairing. Do this for each paragraph. Then, go through and write sentences that connect that topic to\nyour thesis and suggests its importance. Once you\u2019ve done this your paper is basically written. Put your paragraphs into the order\nthat they will appear in your final draft. Once you\u2019ve done this, your final rhetorical task is simple: add a sentence to the end of each\nparagraph that creates a transition to the topic discussed in the next paragraph. With these tasks completed, all that\u2019s left to do is\ncompose your introduction, conclusion, revise, and submit your essay.\nConclusion\nBy clarifying the many constitutive steps that make up the overarching writing process, we find that each step is easier to complete.\nFocusing on one step at a time, we watch as our essays develop out of our research before our eyes. This method takes the strain out\nof the way we write and helps us have a more fulfilling experience while composing. You\u2019ll notice that when you inhabit one type\nof thinking at a time, your thoughts arrive clearer, and your transmission of those thoughts to the page is sharper. The method I\u2019ve\npresented here is not the only way you might split up the tasks of the writing process but trying it out is a good place to start. Each\nstudent is at liberty to follow their own thought process and writing habits to tailor this method to their own needs. We find that\nwith a little discipline and time management we can make the once-dreaded writing assignment a pleasant and fulfilling task. Happy\nwriting!\nDiscussion Questions\n1.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a better understanding of what proper literary analysis looks\nlike and how to conduct analysis yourself.\nKey Terms\nBelow are some key terms from the field of literary criticism that should help you when conducting your own analysis:\n\u2022 Meaning\n\u2022 Function\n\u2022 Interpretation\nWhen I was studying literature in college, my professors would often write on my papers in bright red ink: Needs More Analysis.\nTeachers had explained to me that to prove an idea I had to (1) make a claim, (2) provide evidence, (3) and analyze. This confused me,\nsince I thought I had proven my points fine enough with evidence alone\u2014after all, offering evidence is how we show our ideas are\ncorrect. If I want to prove that it\u2019s raining outside, all I need to do is draw the curtain and show you; surely, I don\u2019t need to \u201canalyze\u201d\nthe way the drops are falling on the pavement outside, do I?\nWhat I later learned is that even though this is true for a lot of scenarios, it isn\u2019t always true when we\u2019re dealing with language.\nLanguage isn\u2019t concrete\u2014it\u2019s mutable, contingent, ever-changing, and ever-evolving. Language is contextual and changes based\non who is speaking, who is listening, and what, where, when, why, and how words are spoken. For this reason, language needs\ninvestigation, it needs unpacking, it needs thoughtful consideration\u2014in other words: it needs analysis.\nThroughout this chapter, we\u2019ll look at some examples of successful analysis as well as occasions where analysis falls a bit short of its\ngoal. And by focusing on literary writing, we\u2019ll see language in some of its most creative forms. As you\u2019ll shortly see, creative works can\nsometimes trick us into thinking we\u2019ve analyzed when all we\u2019ve really done is interpret. Interpreting in order to understand writing 84 | A MODERNIST TEACHES ANALYSIS\nis immensely important, but when we then properly analyze it, we get an even richer array of interesting insight and meaning from\nthe literature we read.\nDefining Literary Analysis\nAnalysis is the process of breaking down something complex into its most basic parts to better understand it in its entirety. In other\nwords, analysis is the act of dissecting, scrutinizing closely, and then building back up\u2014but this time, with the new knowledge we\nhave about that thing. If I handed you a Rubik\u2019s cube, for instance, and asked you to tell me how it works, you might say something\nlike, \u201cthe sides rotate and spin in different ways to allow you to line up the color-coded squares.\u201d This is technically true, but it\nanswers what a Rubik\u2019s cube does, not how it works. To see how it works, you\u2019d be better off opening it up and seeing the internal\nmechanisms. Break it down, scrutinize it, and then build it back up.\nWhen we analyze literature, we\u2019re really asking the same question: how does this work? As we\u2019ll see later in this chapter, sometimes\nwe get caught up in what a work of literature is\u2014or what it means\u2014and neglect to consider how it functions, which is the ultimate\ngoal of literary analysis. Let\u2019s take a book a lot of us have read, F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby, and consider one of its most\nmemorable images, the green light across the water. A perennial question that plagues readers of The Great Gatsby is \u201cwhat does the\ngreen light mean?\u201d to which perhaps the most common answer is \u201cthe American Dream.\u201d This is certainly true, but when we expand\nour inquiry to ask \u201cand how does it function in the novel?\u201d we get much more interesting answers. Here, we might say something\nlike, \u201cthe light\u2019s distance and Gatsby\u2019s longing for it serve to critique the illusion of social mobility and the rhetoric of the American\nDream. Gatsby can always see the light, but it is always out of reach.\u201d This insight is far richer and more interesting than merely\npointing out the symbolic meaning of the light, and it represents an example of great literary analysis.\nAnalysis is also, of course, a thing. In its noun form, an analysis can be your argument, your ideas, your essay, your paragraph, etc.\nIn your own writing, you will likely have sections that you consider \u201canalysis\u201d sections\u2014passages of your own writing dedicated to\nthe work of unpacking and scrutinizing the literature you\u2019re exploring. These pieces supplement and complement the other pieces of\nyour writing, like your thesis statements, summaries, evidentiary support, and such.\nLike many things, there is no right or wrong way to get to an analysis of writing. In fact, sometimes the most unique approaches\ncan result in the sharpest analysis. That said, a few steps to keep in mind will help when approaching and conducting your analysis.\nTo conduct analysis and present it in your own work, you should:\n1. Describe or summarize what you see.\n2. Locate and point out important details (evidence).\n3. Discuss those details and show valuable insights.\nThe most effective thing you can do in a literary analysis is point out how one element of the work has the potential to change our\noverall understanding of it as a whole. In literary scholarship, we call this close reading, and it\u2019s the process of rigorous, tightly-focused\nanalysis\u2014sometimes of just a phrase or a few lines\u2014that newly shapes our understanding of the piece of literature. A great section\nof analysis in an essay will summarize or gesture towards specific passages or moments from the text. Then, the writer will narrow in\non specific details that they think have the potential to contribute to their insight. Finally, those details will be carefully scrutinized\nfor how they contribute to the text\u2019s larger purpose.\nFor instance, in the Great Gatsby example from above, we might say that our analysis of the green light as an indictment of the\nillusion of social mobility changes our overall understanding of the novel and its characters. Now, every time we see Gatsby staring\nat the green light, we know not only is he longing for what it represents, but the scene is now tinged with a cruel irony, as we know\nthe larger function of the light. We don\u2019t just see a man longing for success, we see a man longing for success within the context of a\nsociety in the throes of economic crisis. A MODERNIST TEACHES ANALYSIS | 85\nThe Problem of \u201cMeaning\u201d\nA lot of the time, we are told that the point of analyzing literature is to \u201cfind the meaning.\u201d The search for meaning in literature and\nart has long been a part of how people approach them when they encounter a text with a critical or scholarly eye. This search for\nmeaning tends to come when literature seems foreign to us, when something about the writing we encounter feels opaque or almost\nimpenetrable. For example, when reading the works from the distant past, contemporary readers like ourselves can often feel alienated\nby the language. On top of that, throw in poetic and highly stylized writing and the first problem we encounter with literature is\nquite simply an inability to comprehend what is going on. So, we search for understanding and for meaning.\nIn literature from the modernist period (roughly 1890-1945), in particular, writers were really interested in how the mundane\ncould also be thought of as hugely consequential (T. S. Eliot famously wrote \u201cI have measured out my life with coffee spoons\u201d).\nBecause of this, some of the greatest literature from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are impenetrable precisely because\nthey are so mundane. Take Ernest Hemingway\u2019s famous short story, \u201cHills Like White Elephants,\u201d which is about four pages long\nand almost entirely dialogue. In this story, we readers are like strangers eavesdropping a conversation two people are having with\nno context and very few clues to the topic of their veiled discussion. In this story, we readers search for meaning simply because\nHemingway seemingly withholds all of it from us on purpose.\nBut where is the meaning? Is it in the text itself? Is what a story or a poem \u201cmeans\u201d always already inside the words on the page?\nIf so, then our job is to uncover it, to draw it out, mine it from the difficult passages of the text at hand. But what if meaning is\nelsewhere? What if, rather than being always already in the pages, meaning is created while we read\u2014or, to be more precise, while we\ninterpret and analyze?\nWhen my copy of Mrs. Dalloway sits on my bookshelf, for instance, the shapes made of ink on the pages made of paper are no\nmore \u201cmeaningful\u201d than the wood the shelf is made from or the screws holding it together. But when I pick that book up and read\nit, suddenly I\u2019m bringing to life opportunities for meaning and insight. I\u2019m the one who interprets and analyzes when I interact with\na work of literature; but it isn\u2019t a passive practice of opening up and absorbing the work, it\u2019s an active and dynamic relationship\nbetween your critical eye and the raw material of the book you\u2019re reading.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with searching for meaning in literature; it\u2019s a wonderful and productive practice. The problem comes\nonly when we stop short of fully-fledged analysis. If we try so hard to figure out what a piece of fiction means, we might be reticent\nto continue our investigation into how it works. Here, we need to keep our energy going and move from interpretation into analysis.\nAnalysis vs. Interpretation\nWhen we analyze writing\u2014especially poetic, literary works\u2014we run the risk of merely \u201ctranslating\u201d the writing into something more\nintelligible or familiar. This is useful, especially when the literature seems foreign to us. Sometimes it seems like we need to take a\ndeeply analytical approach just to break down the language just to better understand what\u2019s going on. This is all well and good, but\nwhen we do this, we don\u2019t actually draw any unique meaning from the piece of writing, we just translate it into a different set of\nterms that are more familiar to us.\nIn these moments, we confuse analysis with interpretation. Though related, and useful when utilized in conjunction with one\nanother, these concepts are distinct. Failing to recognize the differences can lead to an \u201canalysis\u201d that really isn\u2019t. Here, we ought to\nfocus not on the what, but on the how and why.\nSometimes, it\u2019s useful to strip the allure of interpretation away almost entirely to better focus on analysis. This is why modernist\nliterature in particular is a useful field to study for this purpose. Modernist writers wanted to \u201cMake It New,\u201d as Ezra Pound once\ndeclared, and so they often experimented with how they wrote, even when they often wrote about universal human experiences like\nlove, loss, personal growth and art. Because they focused so much on the form of their work, it allows us to more closely analyze its\nfunction. A useful example here is the very experimental poetry of Gertrude Stein. Here\u2019s a segment from one of her more famously\nexperimental poems, \u201cIf I Told Him.\u201d 86 | A MODERNIST TEACHES ANALYSIS\nIf I told him would he like it. Would he like it if I told him. Would he like it would Napoleon would Napoleon\nwould would he like it.\nIf Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would\nhe like it if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him. If I told him if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him. If I told him would he\nlike it would he like it if I told him.\nIn this opening section to her poem, Stein uses words with meanings attached to them, sure\u2014but in her experimental play, we are\nencouraged to think about things like the poem\u2019s incessant repetition, the musicality of the poem, and the sensation that the formal\naspects of the poem evoke in us. This passage is easier to analyze, in a way, because we can more clearly see what Stein is trying to do\nthan what she might be trying to say. So, in this case, analysis comes more easily. For example, we might say that the repetition of\nthe \u201cif\u201d and the way it\u2019s associated with an action \u201ctold him\u201d serves to show the speaker\u2019s anxiety about committing to something.\nAsking \u201cwould he like it\u201d evokes a fear that what the speaker is going to \u201ctell\u201d Napoleon is precarious, that he may like it or he may\nnot. If we replaced all the \u201cNapoleon\u201d references with another name, it might change the meaning of the poem slightly, but the way\nthese words are working within the poem wouldn\u2019t change that much. Remember, how and why, not always only what.\nPutting Analysis into Practice\nLet\u2019s turn now to another famous work of modernist writing. Take the following lines from T. S. Eliot\u2019s famous poem \u201cThe Love\nSong of J. Alfred Prufrock\u201d as example:\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker\nOne way of analyzing this passage would be to determine what Eliot means by \u201cthe eternal Footman.\u201d A quick bit of research\ninforms us that this is a classic\u2014if a bit opaque\u2014reference to death, personified. Because we now know that death is often referred\nto as \u201cthe eternal Footman,\u201d we can conclude our analysis by stating the following:\nIn this passage, the speaker in Eliot\u2019s poem reveals he is afraid of death. His \u201cgreatness flicker[s],\u201d which recalls a candle at\nrisk of blowing out, symbolizing the end of light, or darkness. Additionally, by referencing \u201cthe eternal Footman,\u201d which is a\neuphemism for death itself, the speaker further shows his anxieties about dying.\nThis is perfectly satisfactory prose, and it serves as great background for analysis in an essay. But let\u2019s take some time to critique it\nas well. Are there moments here where we get any new insight into the speaker of the poem? Or does the analysis merely reframe and\nrepeat the content of the poem itself? The analysis draws interesting insight from Eliot\u2019s choice to use the word \u201cflicker.\u201d Here, the\nanalysis is sharp, since it contributes new ideas to the poem that Eliot hints at or gestures to, but doesn\u2019t say outright. But the second\npart, as you might have guessed, is merely translation disguised as analysis. It tells me what a word or phrase means, and then moves\non.\nLet\u2019s try to analyze this passage again, this time employing more analytical skills while trying to avoid the trap of translation.\nFor this, we\u2019ll think more seriously about the context of the passage and see if there is something more important to latch onto.\nThroughout \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\u201d the speaker is constantly bombarded with his anxiety, self-doubt, confusion,\nprocrastination, and insecurity\u2014and he masks his insecurities with nice clothes. So, knowing at least one aspect of the greater context\nof the poem, what else in this passage strikes you as potentially important?\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker\nAs scholars of literature, we tend to fixate on big-picture human issues\u2014love, death, memory, etc. But in this instance, it might\nbe the more mundane elements that are the most significant. In this passage, let\u2019s analyze closely not what \u201cthe eternal Footman\u201d\nrepresents (death personified), but what he does and his role in this passage. Here\u2019s another example analysis:\nIn this passage, the speaker of Eliot\u2019s poem relates his insecurities and self-conscious nature to a sense of finality and death.\nRelating his \u201cgreatness\u201d to the \u201cflicker\u201d of a candle suggests he is aware it can be extinguished at any moment. When \u201cthe A MODERNIST TEACHES ANALYSIS | 87\neternal Footman,\u201d or the figure of death, holds him by the coat and \u201csnickers,\u201d Eliot argues that even death can penetrate the\nspeaker\u2019s most prized armor\u2014the clothing he puts on to protect his ego. Here, death mocks his paltry attempts to defend\nhimself from the cruel and judgmental eyes of the world.\nIn this analysis, we\u2019ve taken the material Eliot gives us and drawn some greater meaning from it. Rather than merely\ncommunicating what the passage \u201cmeans,\u201d we observed and identified details, summarized their appearance in the text, and discussed\ntheir significance to the writer\u2019s greater artistic project.\nDiscussion Questions\n1. In what everyday scenarios are we interpreting a situation versus scenarios where we analyze a situation?\n2. What formal properties in the Gertrude Stein poem, \u201cIf I Told Him,\u201d can we highlight and begin to investigate? How do they\nchange our understanding of the poem? And what does it contribute?\n3. What questions can we ask ourselves when analyzing literature to help us go beyond interpretation and into the realm of\nanalysis? (For example: \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d can become \u201chow does this change our understanding of the work?\u201d What\nother questions can help us arrive at analysis?\nAbout the Author\nRafael Hernandez\nOKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY\nDr. Rafael Hernandez is an English professor at Oklahoma State University where he teaches courses in literature and writing.\nHe studies British writers from the early twentieth century, focusing on how modernism helped writers and their audiences better\nunderstand the rapidly changing world they lived in.

This analysis is crucial in helping students develop and improve their own writing by\nreflecting and drawing on the techniques implemented by other writers. This chapter explores Kiese Laymon\u2019s essay \u201cMississippi: A\nPoem in Days\u201d to show how audience, argument, evidence, and stance are relevant tools used to decipher an author\u2019s text. Instructors\nand students should be aware that the writer uses racially explicit language.\nAudience\nWhen a person hits share on an Instagram post a lot of thought probably has gone into the picture. Before posting that one photo,\nmore than likely, the person has taken several pictures, reviewed the lighting, colors, angle, and even the items in the background of\neach picture. They\u2019ve thought about who would gravitate toward this particular picture, who would like it, respond with a comment\nto spark conversation within a community, or even share the photograph with other like minds. In other words, they\u2019ve selected the\nparticular photo with a specific audience in mind. An audience is an individual or group of people who share similar ideas, beliefs,\nsituations, and struggles.\nThough some steps may vary, writers make similar decisions before publishing their writing. For instance, a nonfiction writer will\ndetermine which portions of their lives to share in a story. A college professor who writes an essay about the impact of Covid-19 on\ntheir class instruction, will probably include different details then if they were composing an essay about their experiences as a mother\nwhile working, during the Covid-19 pandemic. If only writing about being a professor during Covid they may discuss how different\nit feels to teach solely online, the challenges of community building, or the strangeness of teaching to black boxes when students\ndon\u2019t turn their cameras on. Other educators who share similar experiences would be drawn to an essay that has these particular\ndetails.\nIf this same professor decides to write about being a mother and a professor she might write about managing her own and their\nchildren\u2019s Zoom schedules, chronicles of recording content with her children in the house, attending meetings, or presenting at\nconferences while still being responsible for the health and well-being of her children. Though the essence of the essay is about a\nprofessor, the added layer of motherhood invites another audience.\nOne might argue that the readers of the two essays mentioned above could overlap, and while I agree that this is true, what makes\none essay distinct from another is the details the writer decides to include in the essay. Just like the details in the photograph the\nInstagrammer selected were tailored or will naturally connect to particular audiences, the word choices, images, tone of voice, and\nparts of their lives that a writer decides to elaborate deeply on will connect to particular audiences. I don\u2019t want to insinuate that\nall writers or Instagrammers purposely burden themselves with curating or composing their art hoping that specific audiences will DECONSTRUCTING THE WRITER\u2019S MIND | 89\nengage with their material. What I\u2019m trying to make clear is that the topics selected for the material will draw the attention of\nparticular readers.\nAs an example, by day two of Laymon\u2019s essay readers understand that he is unsure if he should travel during the coronavirus due\nto his Grandmama\u2019s health, yet he affirms, \u201cThese are the events where I make most of my money.\u201d Here Laymon is in conversation\nwith an audience of working people who are caretakers of elderly and were facing similar difficult decisions surrounding finances.\nLike the Covid pandemic, Laymon\u2019s audience is layered. Though he begins his essay with a broad conversation about working people\nwho are also caretakers, by day six, Laymon\u2019s audience becomes more finite with the statement, \u201cI never assumed it would take my\nstudents.\u201d He shares his experience as a mourning educator, and therefore serves as a voice to amplify the fears of other educators.\nLaymon\u2019s student doesn\u2019t die as a result of being at school, yet mentioning her death is still important for this essay. Her death\ninvites readers to ponder how schools handled the Covid pandemic. In doing so Laymon\u2019s audience expands to include not only\nparents, but students, and educators who were also navigating the pandemic, and further extends the conversation to include\ngovernment officials and school administrator\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\nThe death of a student due to Covid is a teacher\u2019s fear. Laymon\u2019s mention of the death of his student invites readers to gain\ninsight into the thoughts of a teacher. In the opening sections of this essay, Laymon\u2019s immediate concern is about the elderly and\npeople with compromised immune systems. Laymon simultaneously broadens the conversation to educators, while also narrowing\nthe conversation to include the lives of students. The author\u2019s details about himself as a caretaker of the elderly, as a person who needs\nto work, and a teacher are specific details he includes to relate to and grab the attention of his audiences.\nActivity\nFor each day of the essay use a graphic organizer to document Laymon\u2019s intended audience. Work with a partner.\nArgument\nArgument is one of those terms that some people run from because it seems synonymous with aggression and hostility. There\u2019s also\nthe fear of being \u201cwrong,\u201d which carries the unfounded connotation of ignorance. On the contrary, the ability to argue merely means\none can support conclusions and interpretations with logical reasoning and evidence. This signifies the ability to not only think for\noneself but process and weed out illogical views and ideas. Regarding being wrong, it\u2019s important to understand that an argument\nis an opinion. As such, like people, opinions should be developing, growing, changing, and evolving as knowledge and experience\nincrease. In short, an argument is a personal and\/or logical claim\/belief that is justified through the interpretation of evidence. Keep\nin mind, the phrasing of the argument will vary from reader to reader. However, if the author does their job, mirroring themes and\nideas will appear.\nFor example, in the Mississippi essay, Laymon consistently references racial descriptions to set up the racial discrimination that\nLaymon wants the reader to process. He starts off by implying the impact this racial awareness has on his interpretation of himself,\nas well as how he perceives others interpret him. For example, the author writes, \u201cWhite people treat Black people who smell like\nold cauliflower like Black People.\u201d Scientifically, cooked cauliflower gives off a sulfuric order that has been described as overpowering 90 | DECONSTRUCTING THE WRITER\u2019S MIND\nand unpleasant. The author suggests that white people who view certain Black people as disagreeable see it fitting to avoid or remove\nthem in some way. The addition of the cauliflower also provides the negative connotation desired with the repetition of the phrase\n\u201cBlack people,\u201d helping the reader see the issue with treating Black people like Black people. Laymon goes on to connect everyday\npractices and beliefs such as these to larger acts of discrimination with Tate Reeves\u2019s college and current political acts. These kinds of\nreferences and allusions appear throughout the work from the racial description of the driver to the color of Laymon\u2019s own clothes.\nTime is also used to support the racial argument. It\u2019s important to note the length of time these beliefs and ideas have spanned,\ntaking note of the narrator\u2019s recollections from college all the way to the present day. The time lapse is reinforced in the quote with\nthe inclusion of the word \u201cold.\u201d A simple term but telling since it takes time for something to become \u201cold.\u201d Color and time are\nconsistent motifs that are utilized to connect racial disparities and\/or attacks. Ultimately, his constant awareness of his own physical\nidentity and the identity of others is crucial to his argument. The time references establish how deeply the information has been\nembedded in the narrator and society. This awareness and time coupled with the negative connotation attached to only Black people\nand the acts of society and politicians is meant to insinuate much larger cultural and social disparities. Specifically, Laymon wants the\nreader to understand that the longevity and practice of racism is so rooted in America that violence and discrimination against Black\npeople is an acceptable and routine practice. Essentially, this norming of violence and disrespect has allowed these disparaging ideas\nand beliefs to become as natural as breathing, blinding society to the true impact of racism.\nActivity\nIn a Tweet no more than 140 characters, find an alternative argument supported in the essay. Share Tweets on Twitter\nand tag the author @KieseLaymon\nEvidence\nEvidence is one of those terms that, intellectually, we understand. It\u2019s only when we try to define it that the word begins to bleed\ninto other ideas and concepts, becoming a literary tie dye. But, like everything in an English Composition class, the definition is not\nas important as the identification of the concept or the execution of the skill. That being said, it\u2019s always good to have a working\ndefinition. The one this chapter will use is anything such as direct and indirect quotes, paraphrases, statistics, facts, figures, and\npersonal stories that qualifies as credible. Now, in order for something to be credible, it has to logically and intelligently support\nthe information in the essay. That ranges from supporting the argument, the stance, or the audience. Keep in mind, you can have\nas many facts and figures and stats as you want. It means nothing if it doesn\u2019t support the essay\u2019s components. Also know that\nevidence doesn\u2019t have to be lifeless numbers or charts. Vivid language, dynamic stories, and even personal interpretations can qualify\nas evidence. If the connections are executed successfully, the reader can consciously and\/or unconsciously follow the author\u2019s logic\nand reasoning, thus finding cohesion and comprehension.\nThis section will focus on Laymon\u2019s argument to demonstrate how evidence functions efficiently. Specifically, he utilizes personal\nstories and a careful attention to word choice to show how both Black and non-Black people have accepted that racial violence and\ndiscrimination are understood and acceptable everyday practices. For example, Laymon includes the story of his experiences with the\nfuture Governor Tate when they were both college students. He states,\nI have never written about the heartbreak of seeing the future governor of Mississippi in that group of white boys, proudly DECONSTRUCTING THE WRITER\u2019S MIND | 91\nrepresenting the Kappa Alpha fraternity and its confederate commitment to Black suffering\u2026it hurt my feelings to see Tate doing\nwhat white boys who pledged their identities to the Old South ideologies were supposed to do.\nLaymon outlines the persistence of racism through the connotations of the words incorporated. He starts off by establishing\nhis argument with the phrase \u201csupposed to do,\u201d insinuating that racial violence and discrimination are expected experiences Black\npeople must learn to navigate through. He builds on that idea with the inclusion of the fraternity. Through this word, the reader is\nbrought back to college life and students. For many, college students are seen as vulnerable and impressionable, though still capable of\nrational and logical decision making, using college as a way to transition into adulthood. Furthermore, fraternities can be associated\nwith youthful experimentation, the creation of life-long connections, and the development of personal identities. It is through these\nreferences the reader is led to understand how racial ideas are passed down, and thus embed themselves throughout history.\nLaymon further achieves the necessary connections by including \u201cthe Old South ideologies\u201d and \u201cconfederate commitment,\u201d\nbringing the reader back to slavery days. Even though history has taught that neither the North nor the South were concerned with\nthe wellbeing of enslaved Black beyond their monetary value, slaves were known to run to the North because of the heightened\ncruelty endured in the South. This phrase combined with the assumptions surrounding fraternity life solidifies the author\u2019s reasoning\nthat racial disparities are engraved in the everyday lives of people. Through his language, Laymon establishes how the racist past\nhas infiltrated impressionable minds and ensured its continued existence. Tate being a member of a fraternity which \u201cproudly\nrepresent[s]\u2026its confederate commitment to Black suffering\u201d shows the reader the longevity of these ideas. This longevity is what has\nmade these practices and ideas a regular fixture in the foundation of America.\nActivity\nPartner with a peer.

Within a text, an author\u2019s viewpoint is called a stance or the\nposition taken, or the beliefs held about an argument, usually conveyed through tone, evidence selection, argument formation, and\ninformation organized for a specific\/intended audience.\nIn this chapter, we have discussed Laymon\u2019s selection of specific details to converse with an audience of people who are caregivers,\neducators, Black themselves, and others who are concerned with the safety of Black lives. Laymon is not simply speaking to a specific\naudience, he is a member of the groups for which he speaks. His membership shapes his stance, and it is his decision to use personal\nanecdotes as evidence for his argument, which centers his identity as a part of his stance. Laymon\u2019s word choices, and the space he\ngives to various topics within the essay including race, education, and the coronavirus, help us pinpoint his stance.\nWithin Laymon\u2019s essay, clear and bold statements are anchored down by a tone of fear. To profess, \u201cI am forever a fat Black boy\nfrom Jackson Mississippi,\u201d calls attention to Laymon\u2019s size, racial identity, and geography. In just one sentence, readers are given the\ncontext surrounding Laymon\u2019s writing. By bringing attention to details of his personal body, and his position in the world as a writer\nwho is from Mississippi, Laymon escalates his locality. Due to historical violence against Black bodies, present day racist offences\nincluding the fact that \u201cthirty-two percent of the state\u2019s African Americans live in poverty,\u201d Jesmyn Ward says that \u201cracism is built 92 | DECONSTRUCTING THE WRITER\u2019S MIND\ninto the very bones of Mississippi.\u201d Thus by calling out his state, Laymon brings our attention to the history of Black people in\nMississippi and signals the longevity and normality of racism in America.\nThis fact that this essay was written just weeks after Breonna Taylor\u2019s death deepens who we understand Laymon to be. We know\nTaylor\u2019s death and other recent Black deaths are on his mind and kindles the fear that fuels Laymon\u2019s thoughts as he writes. In day\nfive\u2019s section we are clear that Laymon is aware and disturbed by American\u2019s racial history. Through plain images which recall recent\nways Blacks have been killed we gain an understanding of the impact these deaths have on Laymon\u2019s mental state, his anger and fear\nfor his own life. He states,\nI sit in this house, once the site of a confederate mansion, alone, afraid to go outside, afraid to let anyone outside see me. I am afraid\nof being killed while dreaming. Driving while Black. Jogging while Black. Dreaming while Black. Fighting while Black. Loving while\nBlack.\nThus by calling out his state, and writing about present day violences against Black people, Laymon brings our attention to the\nhistory of Black people in Mississippi and throughout the US, which signals the longevity and normality of racism in America. In\ndoing so, Laymon expresses himself as a Black man who is aware of the racial tension in America and its impact upon himself and\nother Black people. With these specific details Laymon reflects a stance of a writer who fears for his life because he could suffer simply\nbecause of his location and his race.\nActivity\nChoose three or four images that you would post to an Instagram page to reflect Laymon\u2019s stance. Provide a brief\ncaption for each image.\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 Pick a specific audience and explain what details or information the author could have included to reach that audience. How\nmight these new details impact the essay?\n\u2022 Explain how the coronavirus is significant to Laymon\u2019s argument.\n\u2022 Explain how \u201cDay 9\u201d supports or detracts from Laymon\u2019s argument.\n\u2022 Examine a text that you plan to analyze, make a list of word choices the author uses that show stance.

We demonstrate how to analyze\nwriting through an example genre\u2014a job application cover letter. Here, we will start by introducing the concept of\n\u201cgenre\u201d and proceed to teaching you what steps to take in order to translate knowledge of reading the genre to writing\nit. More specifically, you will learn a) what makes job applications a genre, b) how to recognize the genre features of\ncover letters by analyzing a sample text, and c) how to implement the knowledge you gain from the analysis of the genre\ninto your own writing process. By the end of this chapter, you should develop a deeper appreciation of the concept of\ngenre, genre analysis, and genre writing.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Genre\n\u2022 Moves and Steps\n\u2022 Lexicogrammatical Features\nFor almost every university graduate, one future step is to apply for and obtain a job that fits one\u2019s interest, knowledge, skills, and\/\nor degree. Therefore, any student that graduates from university needs to learn how to approach such an important step in life. Most\nuniversity undergraduate students apply for entry-level positions for which the application process is new to them. Consequently,\nlearning what materials to prepare and what genres to write in order to initiate the job application process is of utmost importance.\nHence, the aim of this chapter is to introduce one of the most important components of a job application packet that is often needed\nto land a first job after university\u2014a job application letter, also known as a cover letter.\nIt would be helpful to start with an analogy that simplifies the communicative purpose and importance of the application letter\ngenre; these letters are meant to \u201csell\u201d you to someone that wants to \u201chire \u201c you. Yes! You have guessed it right! Job application\nletters seem to serve a similar function as promoting products, however, what they promote or sell are your knowledge and skills. We APPLIED LINGUISTS TEACH ANALYZING WRITING | 95\nthink this analogy is helpful to set the background for you for what follows. In this chapter, we will first introduce the concept of\n\u201cgenre\u201d, and then, we will introduce the concepts of moves and strategies by providing an analysis of a sample job letter. Here, the\naim would be to also show you how the analysis of lexico-grammatical features can provide us with tools to understand what moves\nand strategies are included in a job application letter. Finally, we will ask you to transfer the knowledge you will learn from our sample\nanalysis in this chapter in your own writing by discussing a set of guided questions at the end.\nThe Concept of Genre\nHere, we define genre as a class or a type of spoken or written texts that indicate similarities in their purpose, content, form and\/\nor context (Hyon, 2018). A genre in this sense is a tool that facilitates communication of people around a certain communicative\npurpose that both producers and receivers of a genre are aware of. Moreover, for a grene to be successful in delivering the appropriate\nand intended messages of producers, they must adhere to some genre creation norms that make the genre and its intentions\nidentifiable by receivers of the genre. To understand this concept better, pay attention to the excerpts of text in table 1.\nTable 1\nTwo Examples of the Letter Genre\nExample 1 Example 2\n(1) Dear Mr. Smith\n(1) Dear Mr. X:\n(2) Since you\u2019re one of our important customers who appreciates\n(2) I would like to be considered as a candidate for the teaching assistant\nconvenience and value, I am writing to share an opportunity to\nposition advertised in the Jordan Times on the 2nd of January 2000.\nenjoy both!\n(3) I have finished my degree in English for specific purposes (ESP) with\n(3) For example, would you like to choose $60 worth of\nan average \u2018excellent\u2019. I have taken all the ESP courses offered in the\nInnovations merchandise- absolutely FREE?\ndepartment; thus, I have solid background knowledge in ESP teaching.\n(4) And could you benefit from a very convenient credit card-\n(4) My knowledge of ESP course materials goes beyond my formal\none that offers you a free Rewards program, unsurpassed card\nclassroom education. For the past two years I have worked part-time in\nprotection, free PhotoCard, free Purchase Cover, personal\nJordan broadcasting and TV, where I have gained experience in teaching\ncustomer service- and is accepted at over 400,000 locations in\nmass media courses. Also on my own initiative, I designed a teaching\nAustralia, more than 14 million establishments worldwide and\nprogramme for the radio and developed a TV course (Al-Ali, 2004. P.\ngives you cash access at over 341,000 ATMs? (Yunxia, 2000, p.\n8)\n489)\nThe examples in Table 1 showcase two letters. We identify these examples as belonging to the mother genre of \u201cletters\u201d due to\nsimilarities in how they are formatted. In other words, both letters in (1) provide a greeting typical of letter genres, in (2) state\nthe purpose of the letter, in (3) offer the main services and in (4) detail the benefits. The ordering of information in both genres\nseem to indicate that the genres follow relatively the same sequence of information to eventually offer something valuable to the\naddressee. However, when analyzed with relation to context and purpose, the two letters can be distinguished into separate letter\ngenres as what they promote is different and the producers and receivers of the genre seem to belong to rather various communities\nthat use the genre. To put it more clearly, Example 1 promotes a merchandise service to a customer while Example 2 promotes a\njob applicant\u2019s qualifications to a hiring manager. The first letter is a letter genre typical of business communication by business\ncommunity members while the second letter is typical of job application processes. Thus, what defines genres as belonging to more\nspecific categories are a combination of their information structuring, purposes and community of users. Now that you have learned\nthe concept of genre, we will proceed to elaborate the job application genre more by analyzing the genre\u2019s moves and steps. 96 | APPLIED LINGUISTS TEACH ANALYZING WRITING\nMoves and Steps in Job Application Letter Genre\nTo introduce the makeup and structure of the job application letter, we will use the terms \u201cmoves\u201d and \u201csteps\u201d that are typical\nof genre analysis in ESP (English for specific Purposes) tradition developed by Swales (1990, 2004). Swales defines a move as a\n\u201cdiscoursal or rhetorical unit that performs a coherent communicative function in a written or spoken discourse\u201d (Swales, 2004, p.\n228-9). To simplify the definition, a move refers to those text segments that form and shape the overall organization and structure of\na genre and help the user of the genre realize its goal. To realize the overall goal of a genre, \u201ceach move has its own communicative\npurpose, which, together with other moves, contributes to the general communicative purpose of the text\u201d (Pho, 2009, p. 17).\nSteps, then refer to various ways through which some moves are realized. To provide a better understanding, we will follow the move\nstructure of the job application letter proposed by Bhatia (2014) to analyse a sample letter for you to show you how to approach\nthe genre analysis task. Table 2 includes the important moves and seps as proposed by Bhatia (2014) within a sample letter that we\nborrow from Alred, Brusaw and Oliu (2019, P. 40).\nTable 2\nMove\/Step Genre Analysis of a Job Application Letter\nLetter Content Moves and Steps\nDear Ms. Smathers (1):\nDuring the recent NOMAD convention in Washington, Karen Jarrett, (1) Salutation\nDirector of Operations, informed me of an opening at Aerospace\nTechnologies for a manager of new product development (2).\nMy extensive background in engineering exhibit design and (2) Introducing Candidature\nManagement makes me an ideal candidate for this position (3).

Please contact me at (937) 255-4137 or at\nmand@juno.com (7). I look forward to speaking with you (8).\nSincerely (8),\nRobert Mandillo\nEnclosure: R\u00e9sum\u00e9 (5)\nInterestingly, the sample job application letter included all the eight moves that Bhatia (2014) had introduced for job application\nletters. But how do we determine each move and step? To determine the necessary moves and steps for inclusion within a genre, we\nneed to pay attention to how they are witten and identify their lexicogrammatical features.\nLexicogrammatical Features of the Sample\nLet us discuss how various lexicogrammatical features of our sample letter helps us identify the moves and steps and the information\nstructuring in the sample. In move 1, usually to introduce the purpose which is the candidature for the job, job applicants refer to\nhow they have found out about the job vacancy and opening. Hence, the words such as opening are used to refer to the job and APPLIED LINGUISTS TEACH ANALYZING WRITING | 97\nare used to show how they were notified of that and their willingness to apply for it. Using positive and boosting adjectives such as\nextensive and ideal show us that the candidate is establishing credentials. For detailing the essential information such as education\nand job, the candidate simply lists the type of job or degree such as manager of the exhibit design lab and the length of each such\nas the past 7 years. It is common to use verbs and nouns to show further values such as won and received along with awards and\nscholarship. Phrases such as I look forward to discussing my qualifications in an interview can have a pressure impact by persuading\nthe hiring team further to call the candidate to the interview table. Next, contact information is a way to solicit a response by inviting\nthe employers to contact the candaiate. Moreover, a polite tone usually depends on what words are used to end the letter such as I\nlook forward to or sincerely that enables a candidate to end the letter on a polite and warm note. Candidates must always enclose\nmaterials and at times refer back to the enclosed resume as the most important accompanying component of the job application\nletter.\nThe analysis above helps us understand how we can observe the sample language used in the job application or any other desired\ngenre to draw on the communicative purpose of the text and learn from it. In other words, the analysis of lexciogrammatcial features\nenables us to identify the necessary moves and steps of a genre and the possible ways of organizing those in our own writing.\nImplementing Genre Analysis Observations in Your Writing\nTo implement the knowledge you gain from the analysis of sample job application letters, you need to become familiar with the\nprocess of how to do so. Here, we introduce an efficient three-step process that goes from analysis of the rhetorical situation of the\njob application letter, to using the proposed moves and steps in outlining the letter to drafting your letter. Let us expand these in the\nfollowing sections.\nAnalyze the Rhetorical Situation of the Job Application Letter\nTo write any genre, it is of utmost importance to understand why you are writing the genre and for what communicative purposes\nas well as to whom you are writing. While the intention of job application letters is to highlight your abilities and qualifications for\nthe hiring party, the hiring party, or your audience, is various depending on the jobs that you would apply for. We strongly suggest\nthat you analyze the job posting or the requirements of the job you are applying for and also to know who the hiring committee is\nand what their specific needs are before drafting your letter. After gaining a good grasp of the rhetorical situation of your application\nletter, you can then start outlining and drafting your letter accordingly.\nOutlining the Job Application Letter\nTo approach drafting the job application letter, we advise you first outline the draft by taking into consideration the identified moves\nand steps introduced in the previous section. Outlining helps you develop the ideas by identifying the very important and main\nqualifications that you would want to bring to the fore without getting bogged down by details of the letter. Moreover, outlining\nclears up your vision of the connections between the qualifications you would want to highlight and the main requirements of the\nposition as well as the mission of the hiring party. To simplify the outlining for you, we suggest you create a table similar to Table 3\nhere.\nTable 3\nOutlining the Job Application Letter 98 | APPLIED LINGUISTS TEACH ANALYZING WRITING\nMoves and\nMain Points Rough Draft\nSteps\n-To Ms. \u2026.\nSalutation -To Hiring Dear Ms. Edmonds,\nCommittee\nat \u2026.\n-My name\n-My current\njob and\ncompany\nIntroducing -Found My name is \u2026. .

I look forward to hearing from you.\nResponse info\nIn the first column of the table, place the necessary moves and steps that you want to organize your letter around. In the central\ncolumn, include the very main points that you would want to include and emphasize in your application letter. A very important\npoint to consider after completing this section is to gauge the relevance of the main points to the job posting requirements before\ndrafting the points in paragraphs. In our imaginary example in Table 3, the candidate expresses the value of candidature by having\ntheir certification in working with students with disability as one of the main points. This point would bear a very important and\nmajor relevance to the job posting if the job had listed this quality as required by the position. APPLIED LINGUISTS TEACH ANALYZING WRITING | 99\nDrafting the Job Application Letter\nThen the candidate can move to the third column by drafting the complete paragraphs and adding extra details to the description\nof main points. Please notice the reversed procedure involved in how you move from the analysis of samples to drafting your own\nsample of the genre. When drafting the complete paragraphs, it would be important to learn from the sample\u2019s lexicogrammatical\nfeatures that we had also highlighted in Table 2. These features can act as starting points for when you draft the letter genre for the\nvery first time. As you gain experience writing letters and encountering more examples, you will develop a repertoire of the useful\nlexicogrammatical features to be included in the different moves and steps of this genre.\nIn this chapter, we introduced the concept of genre, genre moves and steps as well as lexicogrammatical features using the practical\ngenre of job application letter as our genre sample. We hope that the chapter was helpful in providing you with the necessary steps in\nhow to implement your genre knowledge in your own writing by taking a reverse outlining procedure.\nDiscussion Questions\n1. What is a genre? What are the elements that make up the rhetorical situation of the genre?\n2. What are job application letters? How are they organized? Provide some examples of the elxicogrammatcial features\ncommonly used within the organization of the job application letters?\n3. Do you think the knowledge you have gained from the concepts introduced in this chapter as well as the reverse outlining\nprocedure can help you in writing similar other genres?\nReferences\nBhatia, V.

In poetry, authors make very intentional choices in language, punctuation, and structure to convey meaning;\nthis essay will focus on how learning to notice those choices in poetry can help us become more critical of the choices\nmade by writers of other genres as well as become more intentional in our choices in writing.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Diction\n\u2022 Syntax\n\u2022 Form\nSomewhere between the time we first read Shel Silverstein\u2019s Where the Sidewalk Ends and the time we enter a first-year composition\nclassroom, poetry transforms from a fun, playful read to a frustrating, mysterious genre. Poems are deceptive. They use few words,\noften containing only a sentence, but despite looking simple, they contain layers of meaning.\nPoetry is a genre of noticing and capturing moments and of rendering the abstract concrete. Former U.S. Poet Laureate Ted\nKooser (alongside Scottish painter Mark Gilbert) worked with third-year medical students at the University of Nebraska to provide\n\u201clessons in looking.\u201d During these lessons, the medical students were asked to record observations, either in writing or by sketching,\nabout the standardized patients, or actors pretending to \u201csuffer from various ailments. The visual cues they provide, like the slumped\nposture and lack of expression that could signal depression, are easy to overlook in a hurried examination\u2013but they become more\nobvious when the medical student borrows a page from the painter\u2019s easel or the poet\u2019s notebook\u201d (Mangun) 1. Kooser noted that\n1. Mangun, Katherine. \u201cLearning to See, in Order to Heal.\u201d The Chronicle of Higher Education, vol. 53, no. 26, 2 Mar. 2007, www.chronicle.com\/article\/learning-to-see-in-order-to-heal\/. 102 | A POET TEACHES ANALYSIS\nwhile one can look at a list of symptoms and make a diagnosis, when doctors really observe their patients, they may come to a different\nconclusion. Kooser suggests that rather than burying themselves in charts and test results, \u201cthe doctor should take a close look at the\npatient, paying attention to body language\u201d (Mangun). Students in the program found that the close observation required by poetry\nand sketching helped them to be aware of each patient\u2019s individuality and come up with more accurate diagnoses and treatment\nplans.\nJust as the practice of writing poetry can help medical students gain skills for diagnosing patients, analysis of poetry can help\nreaders gain critical reading and writing skills through \u201clessons in looking.\u201d Writing an analysis essay involves breaking down all of\nthe pieces of the text to understand how they work together to create the whole text. When analyzing a text, we often get into a\nroutine. Class discussion of a text frequently follows the same format as we pick out the main points of an article, discuss an author\u2019s\ncredentials for writing a piece, and look for numbers as evidence of logical appeals or personal anecdotes meant to evoke emotions.\nAfter a few class periods of these types of discussions, we may find ourselves skimming the text looking for specific features without\nreally even reading the text; just like the medical students fell into a routine of looking at a list of symptoms rather than looking at an\nindividual patient, we fall into a routine of looking at a list of features rather than individual texts. Poems break us out of that routine\nby requiring us to pay closer attention to the choices the writer has made. When there are no studies cited within the text or there is\nno data to prove the writer\u2019s point, we\u2019re forced to look at the text from a new angle.\nPoems, more than most other genres, place exaggerated attention on diction, syntax, and form. This makes them an ideal genre\nfor practicing analysis and transferring those skills into our own academic writing. When James M. Lang, author of \u201cDistracted:\nWhy You Should Teach Like a Poet,\u201d visited Kathleen Fisher\u2019s introductory theology class, he observed her students completing an\nexercise drawing on \u201cthe ancient tradition of Torah study, in which practitioners slowly read the sacred scriptures of Judaism aloud\nto one another, pausing and discussing and questioning at every turn.\u201d2 During a 20-minute exercise, students were asked to examine\nindividual words and phrases while engaging with each other to question and discuss the words and images in a passage from the\nBook of Genesis. Lang observed that the activity opened \u201ca striking new lens onto [a text] a student has encountered many times\nbefore\u201d (Lang). Poetry\u2019s insistence that every word, every punctuation mark, and every line break add meaning to the text makes it an\nideal genre for this type of close analysis; as readers, we must slow down and examine each choice the writer has made to understand\nhow all of the elements of the poem come together to create meaning.\nDiction is a person\u2019s word choice or language. Different types of communication call for different types of diction. With our\nfriends and family, we may use a more casual, conversational diction. We might use more professional diction in communication\nwith our boss. In academic writing, we use more formal, polished language. When we think of poetry, we often think of flowery,\n\u201chigh falutin\u2019\u201d language; however, poetry makes use of any available language and spans the spectrum of language from ordinary,\neveryday language to scientific language to elevated, sublime language. Some poems combine multiple levels of diction as Jericho\nBrown does in \u201cThe Tradition\u201d where he uses the scientific genus names of flowers, such as aster, nasturtium, and delphinium,\nalongside common names of flowers, like foxglove and baby\u2019s breath, as well as everyday words like dirt and planted.3 The contrast\nbetween this language forces us to stop and question why Brown combines these different levels of diction: why are some flowers\nreferred to with their Latinate scientific genus name while using the common name for others? why use dirt instead of the more\nelevated soil? why use planted instead of sowed?\nBecause of the short nature of a poem, every word counts and poets select words carefully to craft meaning in the poem. Brown\u2019s\nword choices require us to consider not only the denotations, or dictionary definitions of the words, but also the connotations, or\nthe associations, emotional reactions, and other meanings that are attached to a word. If we consider Brown\u2019s choice of the word dirt\nrather than soil using the denotations, we might come to the conclusion that soil is fertile and provides a place for plants to thrive;\ndirt, on the other hand, is less desirable for planting and lacks the nutrients for plants to grow. Choosing this word at the beginning\n2.

A POET TEACHES ANALYSIS | 103\nof the poem alongside the scientific plant names suggests infertile, inhospitable conditions for growth and sets up Brown\u2019s final line:\n\u201cJohn Crawford. Eric Garner. Mike Brown.\u201d This message of inhospitable landscapes deepens when we consider the connotations\nof dirt. Dirt may bring up associations of the grave as we consider images of dirt being tossed on top of a coffin, which further\nemphasizes the deaths of the men Brown lists in the final line of the poem. Dirt also carries connotations of the racist notion of\nwhiteness being associated with cleanliness while Blackness is associated with dirtiness. The interactions between the varying levels\nof diction allow Brown to craft a complex message about race, identity, life, and death in just fourteen lines.\nIn addition to forcing readers to examine individual words, poetry also requires readers to rethink conventions of grammar and\nmechanics. While academic and professional writing make use of Standard English, poetry frequently breaks from the conventions of\nstandard punctuation, capitalization, and sentence structure to create new layers of meaning in the poem. For example, in \u201cHomage\nto H & the Speedway Diner,\u201d Bernadette Mayer does not use standard punctuation or capitalization:\nh\u2019s wife thinks he spends too much time there (which he does)\nso she started calling him by their dog\u2019s name, peaches\nh is a big fan of northern exposure, oh & i\nforgot to mention the biscuits & gravy. (lines 22-25)4\nRather than seeing the lack of periods at the ends of sentences, the comma splice after exposure, and the lack of capitalization\nfor proper nouns as mistakes, readers must question why Mayer made the choice to stray from standard conventions for writing:\nwhat effect does the lack of punctuation have on the way we read the poem? why has Mayer included some punctuation like the\nparentheses and a few commas (including what would normally be seen as a comma error)? what does Mayer achieve by refusing to\ncapitalize Peaches, Northern Exposure, or I?\nThe opening line of \u201cHomage to H & the Speedway Diner\u201d establishes that the diner is \u201clike a cave full of pictures\u201d and Mayer\ncontinues to build the informal atmosphere of the diner with images of the steak tartare that is instead called \u201cjust raw hamburger\nwith an egg yoke\u201d and sells for $2.25 and a waiter \u201cwho kneels when he takes your order.\u201d When combined with these images, the\ninformal use of punctuation and capitalization highlights the diner\u2019s lack of pretension and builds a conversational voice that makes\nreaders feel welcome in this setting. Allowing the speaker of the poem to praise the diner without the use of periods to break up ideas\nemphasizes the speaker\u2019s admiration for H and the diner by allowing the praise to spill out without pause.\nSimilarly, poets also use syntax, or word order, to add to the meaning of the text. The most common syntactical pattern in English\nis subject-verb-object, but poets often invert this syntax. When Emily Dickinson describes an encounter with a snake in \u201cA narrow\nFellow in the Grass,\u201d she writes, \u201cHis notice instant is\u2013\u201d with the verb coming at the end of the sentence to create a rhythm and\nrepetition of sound that mimics the hiss of a snake in a way traditional syntax would not.5 Robert Frost\u2019s \u201cMending Wall\u201d starts with\na similar technique: \u201cSomething there is that doesn\u2019t love a wall.\u201d6 This unexpected word order causes us to pause and to wonder in\na way that the more direct \u201cThere is something that doesn\u2019t love a wall\u201d would not. Frost carries this sense of wonder and curiosity\nthroughout the poem as the speaker questions the need for a fence between two plots of land that contain only trees while his\nneighbor insists on maintaining the wall: \u201cMy apple trees will never get across \/ and eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. \/ He only\nsays, \u2018Good fences make good neighbors.\u2019\u201d By starting with inverted syntax, Frost places the emphasis on the word \u201csomething\u201d and\ncalls readers to question what that something that doesn\u2019t love walls may be; when the curiosity evoked by the first line is combined\nwith the neighbor\u2019s repetition of \u201cGood fences make good neighbors,\u201d Frost asks readers to reevaluate the role these barriers play in\nour relationships and whether they are as positive as the neighbor suggests.\nPoetry can also take many forms that dictate strict organization of ideas and of language. An abecedarian is a 26-line poem with\nthe first line of the poem starting with the letter A and all of the following lines working through the alphabet until the final line\n4.

The form\nmakes use of refrains by repeating the first and third lines of the first stanza in a specific pattern throughout the poem. The repetition\nof full lines allows poets to explore themes of obsession; these repeated lines turn into images that we cannot get out of our minds\nas we read and they can feel a bit haunting. In Maria Hummel\u2019s \u201cLetter to My Blackout,\u201d the first tercet sets readers up for a\nlively, fun house party full of excess: \u201cDear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound: \/ beneath the house, the kegs roll in; \/ the party flips its\nswitches down.\u201d11 The lines \u201cDear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound\u201d and \u201cthe party flips its switches down\u201d become the refrains for the\npoem, and the repetition at first serves to emphasize the excess of alcohol consumed at the party. However, the repetition also allows\nHummel to switch the tone of the poem halfway through; what starts as a joyful party where the speaker dances with a stranger\nbecomes a terrifying and traumatic moment by the fourth and fifth tercets:\nLet\u2019s go, he says, upstairs now.\nMy cup spills. My shirt is skin.\nDear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound,\nI won\u2019t. Get lucky. Get found. (Hummel, lines 10-13)\nThe repetition of \u201cDear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound\u201d emphasizes the danger the speaker is in; because of the amount of alcohol\nthose in attendance at the party have consumed, there is no one who will find her upstairs. In addition to using repetition to create\nhaunting images, the villanelle (and other forms focused on repetition) also accommodates a conversational style of writing. In\nconversation, we often circle back to ideas and repeat ourselves. This creates the feeling that the speaker of the poem is speaking\ndirectly to the reader and builds a level of intimacy between speaker and reader. The repetition also creates a logical process for reading\nas we come to expect certain lines in specific places and draws our attention to the lines that do not repeat as well as to lines where the\nrefrain is varied.\nOther forms, like prose poetry, challenge our understanding of other genres. For example, on the surface, a prose poem looks like\nprose in the form of sentences and paragraphs without traditional line breaks and stanzas. When we look at prose, we have a set of\nexpectations for the genre, such as a clearly defined subject, linear progression of ideas, and a sense of closure at the end; however, a\nprose poem dissolves the boundaries of genres and breaks down the rules and limits we\u2019ve assigned to genres by combining the visual\nform of prose with poetic devices such as figurative language, alliteration, and repetition. Rather than providing linear organization\nand developed ideas, prose poetry is often elliptical and fragmentary. For example, Joy Harjo\u2019s poem \u201cInvisible Fish,\u201d places images\nof evolving fish learning to walk alongside images of humans coming ashore to \u201cpaint dreams on the dying stone\u201d followed by images\nof Chevy trucks on the ocean floor.12 The placement of these distinct images within the same paragraph causes readers to pause and\nconsider how ancient images of hieroglyphics and modern images of automobiles relate to one another as well as how those human\nartifacts fit in with the images of the evolving fish. Harjo\u2019s poem forces readers to reexamine the rules of genre by creating surprise\n7.

A POET TEACHES ANALYSIS | 105\nin the narrative structure with the attention to language and the overlap of time periods. The prose poem also provides readers with\na familiar framework, the sentence and the paragraph, that can be used to discuss abstract topics. When looking at \u201cThe Invisible\nFish,\u201d we do not have to analyze Harjo\u2019s decisions regarding line breaks or rhyme schemes; instead, we can focus on the way the poem\nexplores the interconnectedness of past and present, human and nonhuman.\nDuring a panel on poetry and protest, Jericho Brown suggested that form creates an architecture for emotion.13 The rules for a\nvillanelle, haiku, sonnet, or any other form provide a structure for writers to explore topics that other genres often try to strip of\nemotion in a quest for objectivity; however, emotion is an important part of understanding the complexity of topics like race, gender,\nand sexuality. Because poets write using a different set of tools than scholars or journalists use, the analysis of poetry can help us look\nat topics from new angles. In \u201cThe Tradition,\u201d Brown draws a parallel between flowers and John Crawford, Eric Garner, and Mike\nBrown and forces us to look at their deaths differently than a news article, a legal document, or a scholarly journal would. Similarly,\nHummel\u2019s \u201cLetter to My Blackout\u201d takes readers to a house party where a rape occurs and uses the villanelle\u2019s repetition to create the\nloss of control, the fear, and the helplessness that are not captured in other genres.\nWhen looking at longer texts, such as articles or books, we may not be able to give each individual word as much attention as we\ncan when analyzing a 14-line poem; however, by embracing poetry\u2019s lessons in looking, we can gain new ways of analyzing other\ntexts. By learning to pay attention to diction, we can identify when writers of articles are using language intentionally to make our\nstomachs turn, our skin crawl, our blood boil. We can also learn to be more intentional with our own word choice in writing to create\nsimilar effects on our readers. Poetry teaches us to see deviations from Standard English\u2013in language, grammar, and mechanics\u2013as\nchoices rather than mistakes; this lens allows us to look more critically at the use of language, grammar, and mechanics in other\ngenres to understand how the authors are creating effects by straying from Standard English\u2019s rules. This also provides us with new\npossibilities for our own writing by giving us permission to break from Standard English when the standard\u2019s rules place limitations\non our ability to communicate ideas effectively.\nWhile poetry\u2019s form often differs significantly from other genres, by learning to question why a poet chose a villanelle over an\nabecedarian or a prose poem instead of a haiku, we can learn to question how writers of other genres forge relationships between ideas\nthrough their choices in organization. As writers, we also become more conscious of our own choices in how we put ideas together.\nThe analysis of poetry helps us become better critical readers, which in turn helps us become better critical writers. Academic writing\ncan often be seen as formulaic and dry, but through analyzing poetry, we can learn to be more intentional in how we create meaning\nin any genre of writing.\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 Poetry is often seen as a genre of emotion. We usually don\u2019t get much information about the author\u2019s credentials and the\nmajority of poems don\u2019t include statistics or other data, so we\u2019re forced to think about persuasion and rhetorical appeals in\nnew ways. When research isn\u2019t clearly cited or we know nothing about the author, what does credibility look like? Does\ncredibility even matter in this genre of writing? When there is no data, what does an appeal to logic or reason look like?\n\u2022 Poets like Bernadette Mayer often omit punctuation rather than following the rules of Standard English in order to create\ncertain effects for the reader. Similarly, poets also add punctuation that goes against the rules of Standard English. For example,\nin \u201cThe Tradition,\u201d Jericho Brown uses periods rather than commas to separate items in a list in the lines: \u201cAster. Nasturtium.\nDelphinium.\u201d and \u201cJohn Crawford. Eric Garner. Mike Brown.\u201d Similarly, in \u201cLetter to My Blackout,\u201d Hummel breaks up the\nfirst line of the fifth tercet with periods: \u201cI won\u2019t. Get lucky. Get found.\u201d How do those choices affect the way we read those\nlines? How would we read them differently if Brown had chosen to use commas in the list instead or if Hummel had\neliminated the periods after won\u2019t and lucky?\n13.

PART IV\nEVALUATING WRITING  14.\nA SOCIOLINGUIST TEACHES EVALUATING\nLANGUAGE\nDr. Ho'omana Nathan Horton\n17 minute read\nASociolinguistTeachesEvaluatingLanguage.print\nWhat You Will Learn in this Chapter\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to develop evaluative criteria for a piece of language (e.g. what makes a piece of\nwriting \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cconvincing,\u201d etc.). You\u2019ll also learn how to use those criteria to support your evaluation of a\npiece of language. We\u2019ll talk about evaluating language from the perspective of sociolinguistics, or the study of how\nsociety and language interact. By the end of this chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to look at some language (a piece of writing),\ndevelop some criteria to evaluate it (is it good or bad, do I like it or not?), and write an evaluation which explains to your\naudience why you feel this way about this piece of language.\nKey Terms\nHere are some terms from sociolinguistics that will help us to think about how and why we evaluate language:\n\u2022 Language attitudes\n\u2022 Stigmatized languages\/dialects\nIn addition to these terms, you\u2019ll see some in-text citations in this chapter. These indicate a reference to another piece of written work.\nSome common reasons these references are used in academic writing are to reference research that supports a claim (as in the first\nthree citations below), or to give credit to the author of an excerpt included in the text (as with the excerpt from Young later in the\nchapter). These typically look like the last name of the author(s) and the year of publication, both inside parentheses (an information-\nprominent citation), or the year of publication in parentheses after the author\u2019s name in the text (an author-prominent citation). 110 | A SOCIOLINGUIST TEACHES EVALUATING WRITING\nEvaluating language\nAnalyzing vs evaluating language\nResearch tells us that children as young as four years old can make a guess about where a speaker is from based on the way they\ntalk (McCullough, Clopper, & Wagner, 2017). This is an example of analyzing language (see the previous section); we hear people\nspeaking a certain way and learn or are told that those people are from a certain region. When we have enough examples of this, we\nhear someone speak, analyze the way they sound, and make a guess about where they might be from based on other people who\nsound like them.\nBut we don\u2019t just learn to analyze language from a very young age; evaluating language, especially spoken language, is a social\npractice that we learn from as early as four years old as well. Day (1980, 1982) and others have demonstrated that children as young as\nfour develop and express positive or negative language attitudes about their own language, and the language of others. This means\nthat they\u2019re not just saying \u201cthis speaker sounds like they come from that region,\u201d they\u2019re saying \u201cthis speaker sounds like they come\nfrom that region, AND that means that they sound good\/bad, intelligent\/unintelligent, lazy\/hardworking, etc.\u201d This is an incredible\ncognitive ability to learn at such a young age!\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to know that there\u2019s nothing at all about any language or dialect that is naturally good\/bad, intelligent\/\nunintelligent, lazy\/hardworking, or any other evaluation. From a linguistic perspective, all languages are equally useful for human\ncommunication, and any evaluations we make about languages or dialects are social judgments of the people who use those languages\nor dialects. But when a dominant group holds and expresses an evaluation of a group and the language they use, their language or\ndialect may become stigmatized, meaning that it\u2019s viewed as worse\/less intelligent\/lazier, etc. than other varieties.\nLet\u2019s take a look at an example of a really useful feature of several American dialects that is also stigmatized. In \u201cStandard American\nEnglish,\u201d (in quotes because this is very hard to define as a variety, but typically refers to the language used predominantly by white\nAmericans), the singular and plural version of the second-person pronoun are both you. So if I say to a classroom full of students\n\u201cYou forgot to turn in your homework,\u201d it\u2019s not clear whether I\u2019m talking to one particular student, or to the whole class.\nTo clear up this ambiguity, many speakers of American English, especially users of African-American English and speakers from\nthe Southern US, use the second-person plural pronoun y\u2019all. To compare with the example above, \u201cY\u2019all forgot to turn in your\nhomework\u201d makes it much clearer that I\u2019m referring to more than one person. As you likely know, this is a pretty salient (well-\nknown) marker of the speech of someone who\u2019s from the South. This means that if someone hears a speaker say y\u2019all, they\u2019re likely\nto extrapolate that this person is from the Southern United States. This is a pretty reasonable analysis, especially if they notice other\nfeatures of Southern English.\nHowever, many listeners (especially if they\u2019re not from this region) may hear this feature, recognize it as Southern English, and\nmake an evaluation about that speaker. Recall that evaluations of a speaker\u2019s language are always an evaluation of the speaker. In the\nUnited States, evaluations of Southern English tend to be negative and associated with slower speech and thought, ignorance, and\nless education, although interestingly, these features (and thus their speakers) are also commonly associated with being humble and\npolite (Hayes, 2013).\nThis example has hopefully helped you to see the difference between the analysis that a speaker who uses y\u2019all may be from the\nSouth, and a positive\/negative evaluation about the word y\u2019all and, by extension, the speaker (or writer) and their group\/region of\norigin. With this distinction in mind, we\u2019ll move on to how we can first develop concrete criteria for evaluating language (especially\nwriting), and then how we can apply these criteria to a piece of writing and share our evaluation with an audience.\nDeveloping criteria for evaluation\nLet\u2019s return to our y\u2019all example for a minute. Despite being associated with lazy thinking and speaking, y\u2019all actually fills a \u201chole\u201d\nin the grammatical system of \u201cStandard English\u201d pronouns, and can help reduce ambiguity. Thus, we can see that a negative A SOCIOLINGUIST TEACHES EVALUATING WRITING | 111\nevaluation of y\u2019all and other Southern American English features probably isn\u2019t based on the criterion of linguistic \u201cusefulness\u201d. If\nanything, y\u2019all can make one\u2019s speaking and writing clearer! Before we start developing criteria for evaluating a piece of writing, let\u2019s\nthink about evaluations that we might already make about language, and what the criteria are for those evaluations.\nWe\u2019ll stick with y\u2019all: if you read the following sentence in an academic essay, would you say it was an example of \u201cgood\u201d writing\nor \u201cbad\u201d writing? Would you say it\u2019s \u201cclear\u201d? Would you say it\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d in this context? Why or why not? Take a look at the\nsentence, then take a minute to brainstorm some adjectives you might use to describe this sentence and, importantly, think about\nwhy you\u2019d choose those adjectives to describe the sentence.\nAlthough Standard American English is implicitly expected by many in academia, y\u2019all do have a right to use your own\nvariety of English in writing assignments for this course and beyond.\nYou may have had an immediate reaction to this sentence, especially to the word y\u2019all in an academic essay, and this is completely\nexpected; remember that we learn at a very young age to both analyze and evaluate language. Just like you have an immediate reaction\nto this sentence, you have similar reactions to other things that you hear and read. We like some things that we read, and we don\u2019t like\nothers. We describe some writing as good, and some as bad. The goal of this chapter is to first acknowledge that evaluations we make\nabout language are subjective, meaning that not everyone will evaluate language in the same way, or based on the same criteria, and\nthen to articulate the criteria that we use to evaluate pieces of writing.\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll focus on evaluating \u201cacademic writing,\u201d which I put in quotes because this is a very broad category which\ncould include such diverse genres as lab reports, annotated bibliographies, argumentative essays, and research writing. However,\nfor this chapter, we\u2019ll consider these categories together, as pieces of writing which share similar communicative goals, namely, to\ncommunicate a process, concept, or argument in a clear, detailed way, to a specific audience.\nEvaluating academic writing\nBefore we can evaluate a piece of academic writing, we\u2019ll need to consider what a piece of academic writing should do, and the\nstrategies that can be used to accomplish this goal. To put it another way, you\u2019ll use what you\u2019ve learned in the excellent chapters\nabout analyzing writing to clearly describe what strategies are used in a piece of writing and whether those strategies accomplish the\ngoals of the author. In order to make this exercise easier, I\u2019ll give you three terms you can use to evaluate a piece of academic writing,\nalthough you could certainly evaluate academic writing through many other perspectives as well. Is this piece of academic writing:\n1. Clear?\n2. Engaging?\n3. Convincing?\nIt\u2019s important to note that you can define these terms however you\u2019d like. That\u2019s the subjective element of evaluating a piece of\nwriting. It\u2019s also crucial to remember that different audiences may evaluate academic writing differently. For example, a piece of\nwriting that\u2019s clear, engaging, and convincing to someone working in Molecular Biology may not be any of those things to a person\nworking in Art History. This is why it\u2019s essential to keep in mind the audience of the piece of writing.\nWhat might make a piece of academic writing clear? What makes it engaging? What makes it convincing? Let\u2019s try applying these\nterms to the example sentence above containing y\u2019all. Is the sentence clear? Why or why not? Does the use of features of a stigmatized\ndialect of English affect the clarity (positively or negatively)? Is the sentence engaging? Does it make you interested in the argument\nand want to keep reading the piece? Does the sentence help to convince you of the author\u2019s argument?\nAgain, these are all questions which have no right answer: you may feel that the sentence is unclear, uninteresting, and\nunconvincing, but it\u2019s crucial that you be able to explain to your audience why you feel this way, using the criteria that you develop\nfor what makes a piece of academic writing clear, engaging, and convincing.\nBefore moving on to the next section, go ahead and develop, then write down a few criteria for what makes a piece of academic\nwriting clear, engaging, and convincing. In your opinion, what kind of strategies do academic authors use who write clear, engaging, 112 | A SOCIOLINGUIST TEACHES EVALUATING WRITING\nand convincing work? If you have some academic writing you\u2019ve recently read that you feel meets those criteria, you may want to take\na look at that for inspiration as you develop your list of criteria.\nApplying criteria for evaluation\nNow that you\u2019ve had some practice developing criteria to evaluate a piece of academic writing, let\u2019s try applying it to something\nlonger than a sentence. Below is an excerpt from an academic essay by professor and scholar Dr. Vershawn Ashanti Young (2010)\nentitled \u201cShould Writers Use They Own English?\u201d In this essay, Young is responding to an article by cultural critic Dr. Stanley Fish\n(2009), who had written an article entitled \u201cWhat Should Colleges Teach.\u201d The opening quote from Young\u2019s article comes from\nFish\u2019s article (note the in-text citation).\n\u201cIf students infected with the facile egalitarianism of soft multiculturalism declare, \u201cI have a right to my own language,\u201d\nreply, \u201cYes, you do, and I am not here to take that language from you; I\u2019m here to teach you another one.\u201d (Who could object\nto learning a second language?) And then get on with it.\u201d (Fish \u201cPart 3\u201d)\nBesides encouraging teachers to be snide and patronizing, Fish flat out confusin (I would say he lyin, but Momma say be\nnice). You cant start off sayin, \u201cdisabuse yo\u2019self of the notion that students have a right to they dialect\u201d and then say to tell\nstudents: \u201cY\u2019all do have a right.\u201d That be hypocritical. It further disingenuous of Fish to ask: \u201cWho could object to learning a\nsecond language?\u201d What he really mean by this rhetorical question is that the \u201cmulticulturals\u201d should be thrilled to leave they\nown dialect and learn another one, the one he promote. If he meant everybody should be thrilled to learn another dialect,\nthen wouldnt everybody be learnin everybody\u2019s dialect? Wouldnt we all become multidialectal and pluralingual? And that\u2019s\nmy exact argument, that we all should know everybody\u2019s dialect, at least as many as we can, and be open to the mix of them\nin oral and written communication.\nSee, dont nobody all the time, nor do they in the same way subscribe to or follow standard modes of expression. Everybody\nmix the dialect they learn at home with whateva other dialect or language they learn afterwards. That\u2019s how we understand\naccents; that\u2019s how we can hear that some people are from a Polish, Spanish, or French language background when they speak\nEnglish. It\u2019s how we can tell somebody is from the South, from Appalachia, from Chicago or any other regional background.\nWe hear that background in they speech, and it\u2019s often expressed in they writin too. It\u2019s natural. (Young, 2010)\nIt\u2019s likely that this piece of academic writing looks quite different from others that you\u2019ve read, and it\u2019s also likely that you had\nsome immediate reaction about whether this writing is clear, engaging, or convincing. However, remember that if we want our own\nevaluation to be clear, engaging, and convincing, it\u2019s important to not just react, but to articulate our evaluation based on clearly-\ndefined criteria. Let\u2019s apply the criteria you developed for the three terms on which we\u2019re evaluating this piece.\nClear\nIs Young\u2019s writing clear? Are you able to understand what he\u2019s saying? Why or why not? How do the features of a variety of English\n(with which you may or may not be familiar) affect your ability to follow his argument? How about the structure of his argument?\nDoes it progress in a way that\u2019s understandable to you?\nEngaging\nIs Young\u2019s writing engaging? If so, what about is it is engaging? Does the use of his own variety of English in academic writing make\nit more engaging, or make you less interested in reading the piece? How about the way he responds to Fish? A SOCIOLINGUIST TEACHES EVALUATING WRITING | 113\nConvincing\nWhat is Young\u2019s main argument here? Are you convinced by Young\u2019s argument? What strategies does he use to try and convince\nthe audience? What lower-level strategies does he use (e.g. specific words, punctuation, grammar)? What broader argumentative\nstrategies does he use?\nAlthough this is a useful practice for evaluating writing, you can develop other criteria for evaluating any piece of writing you\u2019d\nlike! For example, you might evaluate whether a piece of fiction is well-written, entertaining, and interesting. The important thing to\nremember is that what constitutes each of those terms is subjective (up to you), and that you can and should develop specific criteria\nfor what makes a piece of writing each of those things.\nWriting up your evaluation\nNow you\u2019ve had the chance to develop criteria for evaluating writing, and to apply those criteria to a piece of writing. In this final\nsection, I\u2019ll discuss a few strategies for writing up your evaluation of a piece of writing. First, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that\nyour criteria are subjective. What\u2019s clear, engaging, and convincing for one audience may be the opposite for another if they have\ndifferent criteria. Your goal in writing up your evaluation is to express to your readers why you feel that this piece of writing is (or is\nnot) interesting, effective, etc.\nIn order to express your evaluation to your readers, it\u2019s crucial that you clearly define how you\u2019re evaluating the writing and the\ncriteria you\u2019re applying. One successful organizational strategy is to use an introductory paragraph where you tell the audience the\nterms you\u2019re using to evaluate a piece of writing. Then, devote each following paragraph to one of those terms and, before diving into\nthe evaluation, explain to your audience the criteria you used.\nAnother crucial strategy for supporting your evaluation is to use direct examples of the language to explain your evaluation. Let\u2019s\ngo back to the example of the word y\u2019all. I may make the claim that the use of the second-person plural pronoun y\u2019all is clearer than\nthe use of the less-stigmatized you. In order to demonstrate this, I\u2019ve shown a sentence where the less-stigmatized variant leaves some\nambiguity that y\u2019all may not as in the example \u201cyou forgot to turn in your homework\u201d vs \u201cy\u2019all forgot to turn in your homework.\u201d\nSimilarly, when you evaluate a piece of writing, you\u2019ll want to include examples from the text that support your evaluation. For\nexample, if you argue that Young\u2019s (2010) essay above is not clear because his use of African-American English is hard to follow for\nthose unfamiliar with the variety, you may include a sentence which uses features from this variety that were particularly challenging\nfor you to follow.\nOne final strategy for writing a successful and convincing evaluation is to write confidently about your evaluation. Although your\nevaluation is subjective, when you have well-defined criteria and use evidence from the piece of writing to support your evaluation,\nyou can write your evaluation boldly. For example, a common tendency for new academic writers is to \u201chedge\u201d their evaluation by\nsaying things like \u201cI think that Young\u2019s article is unclear because.\u201d Because you\u2019re the author, we know that this is your opinion, and\nbecause you\u2019ve given us the criteria by which you\u2019re evaluating, we know that this is your claim. A more confident way to word this\nevaluation might be \u201cYoung\u2019s article is unclear because of his use of\u2026\u201d\nConclusion\nThroughout your academic career, whether or not you are assigned an evaluative writing assignment, you will be evaluating language,\nboth spoken and written. Remember that in fact, all of us learn to analyze and evaluate language from as early as the age of four!\nEvaluating language is a central part of understanding the language and the people that we read and hear. What this chapter has\naimed to do is give you the skills to develop specific criteria for evaluating language, and to express your evaluation in a way that helps\nyou and others to better understand and communicate with one another. 114 | A SOCIOLINGUIST TEACHES EVALUATING WRITING\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 Think of a time when you evaluated someone\u2019s language use, or when your own language use was evaluated.

We routinely judge, rank, and rate films, television shows, and\nother media as good or bad, as worth watching or not. In this chapter, we will consider strategies for evaluating film that\ngo beyond the subjective opinions of the viewer. This involves an approach to media that is object-oriented\n(emphasizing textual meaning) rather than viewer-oriented (emphasizing personal reactions). The chapter introduces the\ncritical practice of identifying textual functions as a means of understanding the expressive aims of a film. It then stresses\nthe importance of considering form when evaluating media and offers a comparative example of one particular formal\nelement of film, known as mise en sc\u00e8ne. On reading this chapter, students are invited to consider standards of\nevaluation that extend beyond like and dislike.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Function\n\u2022 Convention\n\u2022 Mise en sc\u00e8ne\nDid you like the movie? We\u2019ve all heard this question, uttered as people leave a theater or close Netflix. Much of our interaction with\nmedia is structured around liking things. Are the thumbs up or down? Is the tomato fresh or rotten? Like, comment, subscribe!\nNetflix, YouTube, and other streaming services are continually modifying their recommendation algorithms so that they better\ndeliver content they think you will like. In fact, the entire media industry is devoted to being able to predict whether audiences will\nlike something or not.\nThe likability standard is a common one, then, when evaluating film \u2013 or other types of moving-image media such as television,\nvideo games, and social media \u2013 but is it a useful one? It has its limitations. First, one\u2019s personal taste is, by definition, subjective. Just\nbecause you liked something does not mean that I will. You might want a film to tell a compelling story; I might be more interested\nin its visuals. You might need the film to be realistic; I might prefer more fantastical material. Our definitions of what constitutes a\n\u201cgood\u201d movie, therefore, might be quite far apart, with no way to arbitrate this difference. No wonder Netflix allows for multiple\nprofiles on the same account! A FILM SCHOLAR TEACHES EVALUATIVE WRITING | 117\nThe problem with using enjoyment as our metric is that saying you liked something ultimately tells us more about you than it does\nabout the media object itself. It tells us what you find interesting, suspenseful, scary, or boring, but those are labels that you attach to\na film, not some intrinsic property of it. Nothing is inherently boring; it is always boring to someone.\nA second limitation of the likability standard is that it privileges the familiar. What we have liked in the past we will continue to\nlike, and these repeated consumption habits can overlook content that is different or challenging. Like or dislike are poor metrics for\nthe variety of media texts, which may be intentionally uncomfortable, informative, intriguing, ambiguous, complex, objectionable,\nor obscure. A critic must be attuned and open to what responses the text wants to provoke or experiences it wants to express.\nHow do we evaluate film, if we want to move past liking and enjoyment as our criteria? Valuable criticism means engaging with a\nfilm on its own terms. It is generally not viewer-oriented (emphasizing personal reactions) but object-oriented (emphasizing textual\nmeaning). The goal is to make sense of the media text you\u2019ve just watched, even if you find it unpleasurable or confusing.\nFilm studies has developed useful concepts for evaluating moving-image texts, two of which I will discuss in this chapter. The\nfirst is textual function, which Russian formalist critics introduced in the early 20th century for the study of literature. An emphasis\non function, which describes the intended effect of a textual device, keeps our focus on the text rather than on the responses of\nviewers. The second is the formal element of mise en sc\u00e8ne, which refers to the non-cinematographic aspects of staging a scene. We\nwill consider mise en sc\u00e8ne as part of a broader demonstration of how to critically evaluate a film.\nFUNCTION: What a Film Does\nTo understand the concept of textual function, let\u2019s consider a specific example. In the opening scene of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Vivre\nsa Vie\/My Life to Live (1962), the protagonist, Nana, sits with her husband at the counter of a Paris caf\u00e9 as she tells him that she\nis leaving him to become an actress. In filming this scene, Godard places the camera behind his actors, so we only see the backs\nof their heads. This should strike us as unusual. The beginning of a film typically introduces its main character, but here we are\nprevented from seeing her face throughout the scene. What is the purpose of this atypical choice of framing? In other words, what\nis its function? Function names what a textual element, such as this specific camera placement, does rather than necessarily what it\nmeans. It is what justifies the presence of a textual device. Does it provide us with story information or reveal something about a\ncharacter? Does it develop a theme or convey a mood? In our example from Godard\u2019s film, the function of his camera placement is\nto forestall the viewer\u2019s identification with the character. Rather than losing ourselves in the fiction, we are reminded of the artifice\nof filmmaking, since the unexpected position of the camera reminds us of its presence. Godard instructs the viewer not to approach\nNana as a \u201crealistic\u201d character, but one who will be inscrutable; it will be difficult to figure out what motivates her or what she is\nthinking.\nWe can imagine some viewer dismissing this formal choice as \u201cbad\u201d filmmaking. You can\u2019t see the actress\u2019s face! Viewers have come\nto expect that a film will foster identification with the main character. We want characters to be \u201crelatable.\u201d However, if the intention\nis to prevent this identification with the character, then it hardly makes sense to find a film like Vivre sa Vie lacking on this account.\nEvaluative criticism, in other words, needs to meet a film on its own terms. Rather than imposing our own expectations about what\na film should do, we must be receptive to its intentions and consider how well it achieves those aims. 118 | A FILM SCHOLAR TEACHES EVALUATIVE WRITING\nLearning to recognize functions reorients your attention to commonly used formal techniques. When a textual device is\nconsistently associated with a specific function, this is what we call a convention, or, when it becomes overused, a clich\u00e9. Some\nconventions are so widely used that they are simply accepted as part of the vocabulary of filmmaking; for example, a dissolve between\ntwo shots indicates a lapse of time. That an actor should face the camera is such a fundamental convention that perhaps we did not\neven perceive it as one until Godard violated it.\nConventions develop as creative practitioners \u2013 directors, screenwriters, cinematographers, actors, etc. \u2013 not only borrow from\nprevious films but also innovate new forms. Consider, for example, the convention of parallel editing, where the film alternates\nbetween two spatially separate events that the viewer understands as happening at the same time. Before this convention trained\naudiences to see successive actions as temporally simultaneous, films used other formal strategies that look strange to contemporary\nviewers. The early silent film Life of an American Fireman (Edwin Porter, 1903) repeated the same story event twice from different\nperspectives. In one shot, filmed from the smoke-filled interior of a burning building, we see a rescue ladder appear in the window\nand a fireman enter to carry a mother and child to safety. In the next shot, we see the same action again, but this time from a point\nof view outside of the building. The filmmaker repeated the event because it was assumed that audiences would be confused by\nalternating between both perspectives.\nParallel editing addresses simultaneous actions in a different way, by cutting between them. This technique has become a standard\nfeature of film narration, which means filmmakers can rely on viewers\u2019 knowledge of the conventional meaning and innovate\ndifferent uses of it. In The Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991), the director utilizes parallel editing for a scene that depicts\nan FBI raid on the presumed location of the serial killer Buffalo Bill. Demme alternates between shots inside the house where Bill\nsilences his female captive and outside the house as the agents surround the location. When Bill opens the front door, however, he\nfinds only FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). The other agents were raiding the wrong house. Demme has played with our\nassumptions, using a familiar convention to lead us astray and then surprise us with an unexpected conclusion. Therefore, beyond\nsimply enjoying the trick, a knowledgeable viewer will recognize how Demme utilizes a familiar convention in a new way.\nThe evaluation of film often requires us to consider how conventions change over time. When we judge a film as artistically\npraiseworthy or formally innovative, we do so with an awareness of how it modifies established conventions. Professional critics, for\ninstance, see a lot of movies, and this makes them better equipped to contextualize a film\u2019s formal choices within a director\u2019s other\nwork or other films in the same genre, or within the broader narrational modes and formal strategies that appear across the history of\nthe medium.\nTo summarize, evaluative criticism is a critical engagement with media that is not limited to determinations of good or bad, like or\ndislike. An object-oriented criticism takes its cues from the film itself as to its intended functions, and it seeks criteria for evaluation\nthat are not based in the personal reactions of viewers. What criteria might this include?\n\u2022 Effectivity: What are the intended effects of a scene or of a film generally? How efficiently and effectively does it achieve those\naims? We might find good reason to criticize an action film with unimaginative action set pieces or a musical with substandard\nmusical numbers. Although viewers may disagree about what is frightening and what is not, we can still evaluate how\ncompetently a horror film achieves its scares.\n\u2022 Originality: Does a film carry out its textual functions in a unique or unexpected way? Does the film utilize unconventional\nexpressive means for its intended effects? We can evaluate a film in part based on the degree to which it breaks existing\nconventions or creates new ones.\n\u2022 Complexity: Does the film produce textual devices that carry out multiple functions? Does the film create ambiguity, allowing\nfor differing interpretations of the story? Does the film layer meaning, as for example, when an actor\u2019s line delivery or subtle\ngestures suggest something other than the explicit meaning of their dialogue? A complex film will create a density of meaning\nthat often rewards multiple viewings.\nLet\u2019s note that, while these criteria help us to move past a viewer-oriented criticism, they are not universally applicable. Take for\nexample a film like Gus Van Sant\u2019s Psycho (1998). This film is a shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s famous thriller Psycho A FILM SCHOLAR TEACHES EVALUATIVE WRITING | 119\n(1960). Van Sant cast new actors and shot in color, but except for these and a few other changes, his film is a nearly identical\nrecreation of the earlier version. Is this film original? Nope! Originality as a standard for evaluation doesn\u2019t work for this creative act\nof imitation. The film divided critics, many of whom could not see the point of Van Sant\u2019s copying, but by confronting that question\nof why, object-oriented criticism can meet a film on its own terms and potentially expand our understanding of the artistic medium.\nTo cite another example, consider Andy Warhol\u2019s Empire (1964). The film is an 8-hour shot of the Empire State Building\nfrom dusk to the early hours of the night. Apart from the lights of the building switching on, nothing happens. There are no\ncharacters or story, the camera never moves, and the shot never changes. Is this film complex? Definitely not! But complexity is not\nrelevant to Warhol\u2019s provocative gesture of confronting his viewer with an unchanging image for hours. Why would he create such a\npurposefully boring movie? This is what criticism can tell us if it is open to the idea that the art of film is dedicated to more than just\nenjoyment. Evaluative criticism needs to apply standards of evaluation that fit the object under scrutiny.\nMISE EN SC\u00c8NE: Considering Form\nIf tasked with evaluating a film, then, where does one begin? Casual viewers, including undergraduates in a composition class,\ntend to focus on narrative. Was the story engaging? Were the characters interesting? This attention to story, however, often causes us\nto overlook form. If narrative refers to the what of the story, then form refers to the how.\nTo achieve any textual function, a filmmaker must determine the means of expression. Should the conversation between two\ncharacters be presented in a single take or through an edited sequence of separate shots? Should the camera move in this scene, and if\nso, in what way? A film is nothing more than the end-result of thousands of decisions about what form it should take depending on\nwhat meanings it intends to express. Different choices lead to different effects. Moreover, film has properties that are unique to it as\nan artistic medium which distinguish it from literature, theater, or any other artform. When evaluating film form, we should ask to\nwhat extent and in what manner a film is making use of these formal elements, including editing, cinematography, and sound-image\nrelations.\nLet\u2019s focus on one specific formal element: mise en sc\u00e8ne. Mise en sc\u00e8ne is a term that French film critics borrowed from theater,\nand it is now widely used in film studies. Literally meaning \u201cto place onto the stage,\u201d it is used to refer to all those components of\na film image (called a \u201cshot\u201d) that are physically present when staging a scene. This would include the sets, costumes and makeup,\nprops, lighting, staging (the arrangement of actors within the frame), and performance (the vocal and gestural aspects of acting). It\ndoes not include cinematographic elements such as framing, camera movement, or editing. If you were standing next to the camera\nduring filming, all components of the mise en sc\u00e8ne would be visible to you, but optical effects like a dissolve would not be. Mise en\nsc\u00e8ne is one of the tools for conveying meaning available to filmmakers, and we can evaluate films based on the effectivity, originality,\nand complexity (or other standards!) of their use of this formal element.\nA film\u2019s mise en sc\u00e8ne is unique to it, so direct comparisons can be tricky, but as an illustrative example, let\u2019s examine how two\ndirectors stage the same scene between an original film and its remake. The scene in question comes from the film Imitation of Life,\nwhich was first adapted from Fannie Hurst\u2019s novel by director John Stahl in 1934 and then again by director Douglas Sirk in 1959.\nThe story features a young Black woman (named Peola in the 1934 film and Sarah Jane in the 1959 version) whose light skin tone\nallows her to pass as white. By passing, she can pursue professional opportunities and personal relationships that would otherwise\nbe prohibited to her because of her race. However, doing so also requires that she renounce her mother (Delilah, then Annie) whose\npresence \u201couts\u201d her as Black. This is what happens in our chosen scene: Peola\/Sarah Jane has secured a job but has not told her 120 | A FILM SCHOLAR TEACHES EVALUATIVE WRITING\nmother. Looking for her, her mother shows up at her place of employment, causing her to lose her job once her racial identity is\nrevealed. By examining how each director stages the same story event, we can evaluate their use of mise en sc\u00e8ne to express meaning.\nA full analysis is not possible in this short chapter, so let\u2019s focus on a few revealing differences. In the 1934 version, Peola works\nas a hostess at a restaurant. Positioned behind a sale counter, she is conservatively dressed. Her facial expressions and body language\nindicate a friendly demeanor until Delilah enters the establishment. In the 1959 film, Sarah Jane has a different occupation. Though\nshe told her mother that she had a \u201crespectable job\u201d at the library, she actually works as a lounge singer in a seedy club. The scene\npresents her scantily clad on a small stage performing a song for male customers shown staring at her lasciviously. Whereas the\nlighting in the restaurant was even, brightly lighting the interior, the lighting in the club has deep shadows. In both versions, the\nyoung woman denies knowing her mother and pretends that the woman must be \u201ccrazy.\u201d\nWhat conclusions can we draw from these changes in the setting, costuming, and lighting? Sirk\u2019s staging, we might argue, better\ndevelops the film\u2019s theme of racial passing, since the visual presentation of Sarah Jane\u2019s job as a showgirl (as opposed to Peola\u2019s)\ndepends on soliciting male attention through the visual display of her (seemingly white) body. In the Stahl film, it is only the fact of\nPeola having a job at issue, so the staging plays a minimal role thematically, but in the Sirk version, it is more clearly established how\nSarah Jane\u2019s desire for social advancement depends on her ability to appear as a white woman. There are moral implications to this\nstaging as well. Sirk\u2019s version raises the stakes of Sarah Jane\u2019s renunciation of her mother by suggesting the moral depravity of the\nworld into which she has escaped.\nAnother significant contrast concerns each scene\u2019s depiction of Delilah\/Annie. In both versions, this maternal figure is caring and\nvirtuous, but in Stahl\u2019s version Delilah lacks agency. When Peola denies knowing her, Delilah says nothing and lowers her head in\npainful suffering from the insult. She is accompanied to the restaurant by her employer Beatrice Pullman, and it is this woman who\nreproaches Peola for her denial of her mother. In the Sirk film, Annie confronts Sarah Jane herself, and rather than being silent,\nproudly and assertively claims her daughter as her own. Moreover, Sirk utilizes aspects of the setting to visually express the shifting\ndramatic conflict of the scene. Slated screens separate characters in the frame. Annie is first shown watching Sarah Jane\u2019s performance\nthrough one, and when she announces herself as her mother, a screen is used to divide Sarah Jane from her male companion. This\nvisible dividing line reinforces the viewer\u2019s perception that this interracial romance is now over.\nThe important point to emphasize is that Sirk\u2019s subtle and thoughtful use of mise en sc\u00e8ne amplifies the underlying meaning of the A FILM SCHOLAR TEACHES EVALUATIVE WRITING | 121\nscene. By means of the choices he makes, Sirk revises the racial politics of the earlier film. Peola\u2019s racial passing is a narrative of tragic\nsuffering, but the 1959 film\u2019s depiction of Sarah Jane assists in its criticism of a racially segregated society. The same story expressed\nin a different form can result in radically different meanings. Evaluative criticism, therefore, benefits from a close attention to film\u2019s\nformal elements.\nAs this chapter has emphasized, evaluation is closely related to the analysis or interpretation of texts. Evaluation involves the\nidentification of standards or criteria for determining the relative quality of a film or other media text, but it derives those standards\nnot from the personal taste of the viewer. Instead, evaluation considers the intended aims of the film (its textual functions) and judges\nhow it utilizes the formal properties of the medium to achieve those aims. It seeks to understand how a film\u2019s use of form fits within\nestablished conventions to assess its originality and inventiveness.\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 What are possible criteria, apart from like or dislike, by which viewers can assess the quality of a film?\n\u2022 What are some basic formal conventions in film that you are familiar with from your own viewing?

Much (though not all) of what you encounter\non the web daily are what we call popular information sources, i.e., information written for a general, popular audience. They are\nintended to be easily accessed and understood by anyone who might happen across them. While the web is made up of websites\nterm \u201cwebsites\u201d is too broad for what we want you to think about when you evaluate information. Information can be found on\ngovernment sites, organizational sites, blogs, social media, apps, news organizations, retailers, and many more. When you are online,\nit is important to pay attention to what kind of website you are visiting, especially when fact-checking, as that can tell you a lot about\nthe intention, expertise, and credibility of the information being presented. In the past, when information had to be accessed in print\nforms (like a physical copy of newspaper, or a pamphlet from a charity organization), it was easier to tell what type of source you\nwere looking at. On the web, we have lost a lot of the visual clues that help us identify information source types. That is why when\nfact-checking and evaluating information, it is important to look at more than just the package it comes in (and yes, that includes\nlooking beyond .com, .org, and .gov). A LIBRARIAN TEACHES EVALUATING INFORMATION | 123\nFact-checking information\nIn recent years, the topic of \u201cfake news\u201d has been widely talked about. The term \u201cfake news\u201d is used in many different contexts, and\nit\u2019s meaning often shifts depending on who is using it. It is not a concept that can be easily defined. Instead of calling something\n\u201cfake news,\u201d we should look at terms that more specifically define what kind of information we\u2019re looking at, and how or why it is\nmisleading.\nThe most common types of false or inaccurate information we see on the web falls under one of two headings: misinformation\nor disinformation. Misinformation is used to describe information that is unintentionally false, such as a mistaken statistic or if\nsomeone takes a satirical story seriously. While the information may be inaccurate, the person creating or sharing that information\nwas not intentionally trying to mislead people. Disinformation, on the other hand, is false information that was intended to mislead,\nmanipulate, or lie. Both terms can refer to information that is completely made up, or information that is edited or changed, such as\nmanipulated photos or videos.\nWhen confronted with potentially false or misleading information, we want to develop habits and skills to evaluate what we\u2019re\nseeing and determine if we can trust it or not. To do that, we\u2019re going to go over a method of fact-checking called SIFT.\nSIFT is a series of moves developed by Mike Caulfield to critically examine information on the web for accuracy and reliability.\nThe letters stand for Stop; Investigate the source; Find trusted coverage; and Trace claims, quotes, and media to the original source.\ngoog SIFT and related graphics are licensed CC BY by Mike Caulfield, https:\/\/hapgood.us\/2019\/06\/19\/sift-the-four-moves\/\nWe will go through each of these moves in detail, and share tools and tricks you can use in your fact-checking process. Before we do\nthat, however, we want to make it clear that this is not a checklist approach like you may have encountered before. Information is a\nlot more complicated than that. You won\u2019t always go through each move in the same order every time, and you may circle around\nand repeat moves in your fact-checking process. 124 | A LIBRARIAN TEACHES EVALUATING INFORMATION\nMove 1: Stop\nMuch of the mis\/disinformation you encounter online is designed to play into your emotions: people want you to get angry, sad,\nor happy, because that means you\u2019re more likely to interact with that information in some way, such as commenting or responding\non a post, or by sharing the story online or talking about it with friends and family. That\u2019s why the first move is to stop. When you\nencounter new information online, stop and pay attention to several things:\n\u2022 What kind of emotional you are having, if any\n\u2022 Where this information is being shared, and by whom\n\u2022 The context around the information, such as what form the information takes (i.e., a tweet, a news story, a blog post), if\nimages or videos are also present, and if people are already interacting with it and how\n\u2022 What kind of bias you are bringing to the information\nStopping in this way lets you do several things. First, it allows you to resist the temptation to immediately share or repeat something\nbased on an immediate emotional response. Second, it gives you a chance to consider the source of the information: is it someone you\ntrust to share good information, or is it on a website you\u2019ve never been to? Third, it encourages you to pay attention to the context\nin addition to the information itself. For example, if it is a Twitter post, you know that it is going to have to meet their character\nlimit\u2013which means that by nature it has to be short and succinct, and may not contain all the relevant information. You might also\nnotice if it has been shared a lot and by whom, or if people have commented on it and what they have to say. Finally, you take the time\nto consider your own biases: do you want to accept or reject that information because of your own preexisting beliefs? Or because it\nconfirms or differs from your own opinion?\nAll of these things force you to slow down and not accept what you see at face value. It also gives you a chance to make note of\nthings that are worth investigating further as you progress with your fact-checking.\nMove 2: Investigate the source\nThe next step you might take is to investigate the source. From the previous move, you should have stopped and paid attention to\nwhere the information was posted or share, and who was doing it. It\u2019s possible you already know something about the source, such as\nif it is a trusted website or a writer known for sharing hyper-partisan content. If that\u2019s the case, you can use your previous knowledge\nand experience to determine if and how you should use the information. On the web, though, it is common to end up an unfamiliar\nor new website. In this case, you will want to dig in to learn more about that website, news organization, or person, etc.\nOne great way to do this is to use Wikipedia to learn more about the source. To do this, you simply type the name of the person,\nwebsite, or organization into Google or another search engine, and add the term \u201cwikipedia\u201d to the end of your search. For example,\nyou might type \u201cVox wikipedia\u201d or \u201cWashington Post wikipedia\u201d (without the quotation marks).\nYou can then use the Wikipedia page to look for details about the source. If it is a person, look for things like education,\nemployment, publications, and if they\u2019re affiliated with groups, movements, or organizations. If it is a website, news site, or other\ntype of organization, look for things like how they are funded, if there is a history of controversy or questionable practices, and if\nthey are known to have a bias.\nFinding out more information about where or who information is coming from enables you to make a more informed choice about\nwhat do to: whether that means to trust that information, try to find information somewhere else, or keep digging. Remember, too,\nthat just because information has a perceivable bias does not automatically make it bad. Knowing what that bias is simply helps you\ndetermine how to interpret that information, and if it is appropriate for your needs. A LIBRARIAN TEACHES EVALUATING INFORMATION | 125\nMove 3: Find trusted coverage\nWhen you want to determine if information you have found online is trustworthy, one of the best steps you can take is to verify that\ninformation in multiple sources\u2013better yet if those sources are independent of each other (meaning they are not just citing the same\nsource). You will want to see if you can find multiple places that report the same thing, and be sure to check places you are familiar\nwith and know are trustworthy, like majors news organizations such as NPR, New York Times, or CNN. Look for a consensus across\nmultiple sources, a history of the issue or claim, and any additional context that will help you better understand the information.\nMany people and organizations today are tracking mis\/disinformation, so you can also check fact-checking websites like Snopes,\nPolitifact, and FactCheck.org to see if someone else has already done the work of investigating the information.\nMove 4: Trace claims, quotes, and media to the original source\nWith the ease of creating and spreading information online, a lot of what we see is taken out of context: a photo pulled from a Google\nimage search without knowing the details of where it was taken or uploaded, a clip from an interview missing important details, or a\nimage of a social media post that never actually existed are all examples of ways that different kind of media and quotes can be used\nto show false evidence and lend credibility to mis\/disinformation stories. A lot of the tools you already use on a daily basis can be\nused to trace media. For example, you can paste a link for a photo into a reverse Google Image search or upload a photo to TinEye\nto look for the same or similar photos. This is a great way to find where an image originated or where it has been used. To look for\nvideos, use apps like Youtube. And of course, you can look for original social media posts on the sites where they came from, but it is\nalways possible that posts have been deleted. To look for older versions of websites, you can use the Wayback Machine, a website that\narchives pages on the web.\nBias, scope, and relevancy\nBias\nIn the previous section, we mentioned the word \u201cbias\u201d multiple times. The term bias, like \u201cfake news\u201d is used a lot, and people\ndon\u2019t always mean the same thing when they talk about bias. In this case, we want you to think of bias as the experiences, beliefs,\nand purpose of a creator or source that could influence what they write, create, or share. Everyone has bias, and bias on it\u2019s own\nis not inherently a bad thing. It is when that bias is used against other people or ideas that it becomes a problem. When our own\nbiases lead us to automatically believe information that supports our pre-existing beliefs, or to reject information that contradicts\nour beliefs, that is what is called confirmation bias. This is why the first move in our fact-checking, listed above, is to stop and pay\nattention to the biases of people who wrote or shared the information, and to our own biases. Just because a source (or you!) have\na bias does not automatically make it bad. Consider, for example, the fact that Barilla, a company that makes pasta, funded research\nthat news organizations claimed proved that eating more pasta could help you lose weight. It is quite possible that the science behind\nthe research is sound, but you would still want to know if this potential bias existed.\nScope\nAnother key thing to examine when evaluating any information source is the scope. The scope of a source refers to what kind of and\nhow much information it is trying to impart. This is influenced most heavily by the format a source takes. Consider how much longer\nbooks are than news articles. A book\u2019s scope is much broader\u2013it can cover a lot more detail than a news article, which is trying to\nbe succinct and convey the most important information. Now think about the difference between a news article and a tweet. Social 126 | A LIBRARIAN TEACHES EVALUATING INFORMATION\nmedia platforms in general are not designed for a lot of detail, so even regardless of a user\u2019s intention, they are going to be limited in\nwhat they are able to convey in that format.\nRelevancy\nOne final aspect to examine when evaluating information is the relevancy. If an information source has passed all the moves from\nyour fact-checking, some final questions to ask yourself are:\n\u2022 What perspective is being presented?\n\u2022 What does this information add to your knowledge and understanding of the topic?\n\u2022 How can you use it to demonstrate or prove your points?\nDiscussion Questions\n\u2022 Locate a web source that is relevant to your writing topic, or find a social media post that makes some kind of claim or\nassertion. Evaluate it using the SIFT steps. Describe your process of completing each step. When you have completed your\nevaluation, reflect on the entire process: which parts were easy or challenging? What is your final assessment of the source you\nfound?\n\u2022 What kind of \u201cinformation bias\u201d do you have? Are you more likely to access, consume, or believe content made available\nthrough certain websites or organizations? Do your preferences change depending what information you need or what you\nneed to use it for? How so? Do you feel that your preferences are justified, or do you think you should seek out other sources\nof information? Explain your reasoning.\n\u2022 How do you feel about using information that you find through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media? How could you\ndetermine the authority of an author who posts something online through social media?\nAbout the Author\nHolly Reiter\nOKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY\nhttps:\/\/experts.okstate.edu\/holly.reiter\nHolly Reiter is an associate professor and the Director for Teaching and Learning in the university libraries at Oklahoma State\nUniversity.

All evaluation is guided by a set of criteria or expectations, and many\nof those expectations are created by the community that engages with a topic. However, it is up to the evaluator to\nrevise, apply, and explain those criteria in a way that is clear to the audience, even if the audience ends up disagreeing\nwith the evaluator.\nKey Terms\n\u2022 Criteria\n\u2022 Secondary sources\nEvaluation\nCriteria\nIn sports fandom, there are a lot of debates. Debates about which team is playing better, which player deserves what award, how\nrules should be applied or changed, what a team\u2019s uniforms should look like, and countless others. Sometimes these debates can be\nresolved easily or can achieve a sort of consensus among fans, but more often than not, fans will continue to disagree on what they\nthink about their teams or sports.\nOne less serious debate that rarely reaches a consensus is about which athlete is the Greatest of All Time in their sport or even in all\nsports. The Greatest of All Time or GOAT conversation rarely resolves because fans typically don\u2019t value the same things. Some fans\nwatch sports for the excitement of a close game, while some want their team to crush every opponent and the outcome of the game\nis never in doubt. Some fans track stats while others respond more to well-structured narratives. In GOAT discussions, Fans have a\ntough time agreeing because they have different expectations of what a GOAT should be. In fact, more often than not, the GOAT A SPORTS RHETORICIAN TEACHES EVALUATION | 129\ndebate is usually just as much about the criteria we use to define the GOAT as it is about who fits that criteria. This is true of other\nsimilar debates about the best album of the year, best restaurant in town, or best video game console. Creating good criteria for these\nconversations is almost a bigger task than deciding which person, album, restaurant, or console fulfills them.\nSo if criteria are so important to these conversations, what exactly are they?\nWhen we talk about criteria, we often think about them as strict rules, and sometimes they are. For example, if an individual\nWNBA player scores the most total points across all games during the regular season, they win the \u201cScoring Title.\u201d The same is\ntrue for players in the NBA. The criteria are simple: score more points than any other player that season. Or when trying to make\na particular grade in a class, a student will usually need to earn a certain number of points to get an A or B. However, criteria are\ntypically not this simple.\nCriteria are more like expectations. What do we expect from the album of the year? What do we expect from the greatest basketball\nplayer of all time? What do we expect from a frozen waffle we reheated in a toaster or microwave? These expectations are usually\nformed collaboratively between individuals and the communities that care about whatever the criteria is about. So, in the case of\nathletics: fans, sports media, coaches, athletes, academics, owners, and others involved in a sport are the ones who have some control\nover what we expect from an athlete. Each person provides input in some way into what they think is important and then eventually\na general set of expectations takes root.\nBut how can we tell what those general expectations are, especially if we\u2019re new to a topic?\nCriteria are communal\nOne of the key ways to discover criteria is to listen. We say listening here, we\u2019re not just talking about what you hear, but of\npurposefully being aware of what people say, writer, or do about a topic.\nFor example, if you wanted to figure out what people generally expect from a good romantic comedy, you might start by watching\na bunch of romantic comedies. By watching the trends and repeated tropes in these movies, you can start to see what people expect\nfrom these films in an indirect way. You can formulate a lot of useful ideas from examining these primary sources, or the actual\nsubjects of the conversation, but it might be a slower process at understanding what fans of romantic comedies think is important.\nTo get to that idea more directly, you need to go to secondary sources, or look at what people say about or in response to romantic\ncomedies. You could read reviews, watch videos that present their top 10 romantic comedies of all times, or even engage in direct\nconversation with fans of the genre. Regardless of where you start, you want to figuratively cast a wide net and get a lot of different\nperspectives to really get a sense of what fans think makes a good romantic comedy and what makes a bad one.\nIn a similar sense, if you wanted to figure out with men\u2019s basketball player is the greatest of all time, you could watch video of\nprofessional players since the creation of the NBA, but this would be a slow process and might still not give you as direct of a picture\nof what fans think makes a player the GOAT. So you would again need to turn to secondary sources and read articles, listen to sports\ncommentators and analysts debate, talk to fans from different teams, etc. Through this process you would begin to see a clearer\npicture about what fans value and what they don\u2019t. As you dig into secondary sources for any topic, you will want to watch for\ncommon trends. What ideas or people are mentioned frequently and which ones aren\u2019t? What are common expectations and which\nones are less frequent?\nIf you examined sources in 2021 about who the GOAT of men\u2019s basketball is, you would at this moment see names like Michael\nJordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Wilt Chamberlain mentioned more commonly than other players\nwith Michael Jordan and LeBron James being the most common. Ideas that would typically come up are how many points each\nplayers scored, how many times they won Most Valuable Player, how many championships they won, and how much they changed\nthe trajectory of each team they were on. Reputation can sometimes point you to what fans value about players, but it can also create\nblind spots. After all, most sports were not integrated for much of their history, so some of the best non-white players have not\nreceived the same amount of exposure even if they were superior to their more popular white counterparts. Because these non-white\nathletes played in non-white leagues or non-white teams that were largely ignored by the press, their reputations are less developed 130 | A SPORTS RHETORICIAN TEACHES EVALUATION\neven though they may fit the criteria for being a great player. Many women\u2019s teams still don\u2019t received the same level of accolades or\npraise that their male counterparts received. For example, women were playing American football in the 1930s and 40s and leagues\nwere beginning to form as the men\u2019s sport was asserting itself; however, some administrators and politicians found the sport to be\n\u201ctoo masculine\u201d for women and shut down or banned women from playing the game. Even now as women\u2019s leagues and sports are\nslowly gaining public sports, women\u2019s football is largely unaccepted because of generally held values by fans of the sport and the\nUnited States about which sports men and women should play. There are many other instances of athletes being ignored due to their\nactivism, their politics, or because a handful of powerful people decided they didn\u2019t like the athlete\/team\/sport. So while paying\nattention to trends and commonly brought up names and talking points can give you a sense of expectations, these expectations and\ncriteria are not neutral or formed in neutral environment. No set of communally formed criteria will be without some of the bias and\nhistorical prejudice of the community that forms it.\nSecondary sources and community expectations can be an incredibly useful step in developing criteria, but they can have\nlimitations which means we must also shape criteria from our own personal experience and analysis.\nCriteria are personal\nEven though criteria are formed collaboratively with others, we still need to personally decide how we want to use those expectations\nand where we want to change them or insert our own. As we discussed above, sometimes the criteria created by a community has\nprejudices or unfair expectations built into it which can mean following those criteria exactly would continue those prejudices. While\ncriteria naturally update over time, we can also change them intentionally though we still have to be able to articulate why these new\ncriteria are good ones to use.\nFor example, let\u2019s return to the conversation about the GOAT of men\u2019s basketball. As we discussed above, when reading sources,\nyou will come across common names like Micheal Jordan and common requirements like championships. However, you still need\nto determine and explore how to approach those criteria and if you think they are being applied correctly. For example, Michael\nJordan played for a team called the Chicago Bulls and after he joined the team, the Bulls had gone from losing most of their games to\nwinning most of their games, and starting in 1990 Jordan and the Bulls won 6 of the next 8 NBA championships. LeBron James, on\nthe other hand, has led 3 different teams to 4 championships, including the Cleveland Cavaliers whose only championship in their\n51 year existence came as a direct result of James\u2019s presence on the team. Kobe Bryant won 5 championships though he played for the\nLos Angeles Lakers, who had an established history of success. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6 championships) and Wilt Chamberlain (2\nchampionships) also played for the Lakers for a significant part of their careers, but they helped establish the success of that team for\nplayers like Kobe Bryant to take advantage of in later years. However, if you base your discussion solely off of championships won,\nnone of these players would even be considered as the GOAT. Instead, this would go to Bill Russell who won 11 NBA titles or Sam\nJones who was on the same team as Russell and won 10. Both of these players should be considered in that conversation, but they are\noften overlooked because of how long ago they played (1950s & 60s) compared to players like Michael Jordan (1980s-00s) or LeBron\nJames (2000s-20s). Thus, even this simple set of criteria conflicts in some ways from the common conversation around the issue.\nYou could stop there and consider only championships and numerical measures like wins and losses, but that would likely give\nyou an incomplete picture of who is the GOAT. After all, an excellent player can lose a lot in a team sport while still being one of\nthe best players of all time. Someone like US gymnast Simone Biles could fall short of winning a team gold medal at the Olympics\nbecause her teammates may have struggled to record high enough scores to win gold, but Biles could still win individual gold and\nbe individually incredible. Or in sports like American football or soccer where teams are much bigger and require synergy between\neven more players than gymnastics or basketball, many of the players with the record setting individual statistics have only won few\nif any championships at the professional and college level. However, in an individual sport like tennis, wins and titles can be more\nrepresentative of individual greatness. Tennis player Serena Williams has won more Grand Slam tournaments, the most competitive\nand difficult tournaments to win, than any other tennis player in the last 45 years. It doesn\u2019t mean that another individual player\ncould not have beaten her or even been better than her at times, but we can read her statistics a little differently than we would A SPORTS RHETORICIAN TEACHES EVALUATION | 131\nsomeone like Michael Jordan or Simone Biles who had to depend on teammates for some of their success. Thus we would need to\nfigure out how to balance team accomplishments vs. individual accomplishments as we consider who the greatest men\u2019s basketball\nplayer of all time is.\nWhile all of these examples come from sports, these questions and concerns can apply to evaluating other things, even something as\nubiquitous as fast food. Instead of considering teams vs individuals we might think or brand reputation vs specific locations or meals.\nHow much does the reputation of a chain restaurant like McDonald\u2019s effect how much we enjoy their food on a single occasion?\nOr In-and-Out? Or Whataburger? Or Starbucks? How much loyalty do we have to certain brands and how much does that make us\nexcuse the shortcomings of their products? Does it matter more that our phones and computers all run the same operating system or\nthat they all work exactly how we want them to individually? These and other similar questions are one we will need to grapple with\nas we create our criteria for anything, especially if we are going to argue that our criteria is reasonable. How much were communal\ncriteria decided on by people who don\u2019t share our experiences or needs? What do other people say about this topic, and how does\nthat fit with what I see or experience? And alternatively, how much does my own personal taste change my criteria and where is there\nroom for disagreement?\nTo form a clear set of criteria for even something as low stakes as the GOAT of men\u2019s basketball, we would need to dissect and\nconsider this and many other questions about what criteria to use in this debate. Even in instances where we take up the common\ncriteria used by most people, our specific application of those criteria will require us to make choices about how to apply those criteria\nand how to explain that application to our audience.\nBuilding criteria\nWhen building criteria, you need to be able to clearly articulate what your reasons are for the criteria you have. You may never include\nall of those reasons in your writing, but having a clear vision of your criteria makes composing more straightforward. It can be much\neasier to compose an evaluation if you understand your criteria in advance as opposed to figuring them out as you go. Let\u2019s take a\nlook at one example of what that might look like.\nTo deviate a little from the sports metaphors, let\u2019s instead talk about how we would determine the best pizza in town. You can\napproach this from a lot of different directions, but if we\u2019re going to focus primarily on the food itself, usually the areas we would\nassess are: crust, sauce, toppings, and cheese. But those 4 areas aren\u2019t criteria yet since they don\u2019t give us an expectations yet, so we\u2019ll\nneed to determine what expectations we have for a good pizza in those 4 categories.\nIn the category of crust, people tend to prefer many different styles of crust, so making criteria like \u201ccrust needs to be thin and\ncrispy\u201d or \u201ccrust needs to be thick with air pockets like bread\u201d would make the assessment too narrow. Instead, we should discuss a\nquality that can be assessed, something like flavor. Something like \u201ccrust should have a light flavor but not be tasteless\u201d might work\nbetter for our purposes because it gives us a scale to work on. If the crust flavor is overpowering or absent, something has gone wrong\nand we can notice that fairly easily while eating a wide variety of pizzas.\nWe could use a similar format for the other 3 categories where instead of prescribing a particular kind of pizza, we look for qualities\nthat extend across most types. We could assess how much sauce there is and if the sauce has a good balance of sweet and savory, we\ncould ask if there is enough cheese to blanket the sauce and if it has enough flavor to be good without any other toppings, and we\ncould check on if the toppings are fresh and mesh well with the other components of the pizza. Now our criteria have gone from the\n4 categories of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings to:\n1. Crust should have a light flavor but not be tasteless.\n2. Sauce should cover entire pizza but not be so much that it makes eating the pizza difficult. Sauce should have a good balance of\nsweet and savory.\n3. Cheese should cover entire middle of pizza and have enough flavor to stand on its own without any other toppings.\n4. Toppings of any kind should be fresh and should work well with other ingredients.
