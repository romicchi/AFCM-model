Humans began living closely along\nthe banks of rivers and the coasts of oceans, but\nby this era empires spanned thousands, and\nsometimes more than a million, square miles. At\nits peak, the Roman Empire covered a territory of\napproximately 1.69 million square miles and the\nAchaemenid Empire covered an area of\napproximately 3.29 million square miles.

But\nhow else did geography impact and influence human life and development?\nTerms, places, and people:\nGeography greatly impacted empires in a number of different ways. In some\nPersians\ncases empires were aided and protected by geography and in other cases empires\nwere limited and hindered by their geography. Why were the Persians able to\nconstruct one of the largest empires in the world? When you examine geography\nthe answer becomes clearer: there are very few geographical barriers in that region\nof the world which allowed them to expand and grow into a massive empire.\nGeographical barriers could also act as a source of protection for empires. As\nyou learned in the previous chapter, the Chinese Empire enjoyed protection on\nthree sides with natural barriers to potential invaders. They decided to build a wall\nwhere natural barriers didn\u2019t exist.\n90 By contrast, some regions were limited and constrained by the if we can uncover how geography affects empires.

The majority of these rulers\ncreated an autocracy, a government in which they were the sole ruler, or an\noligarchy, where the empire was ruled by a small group of people. Many empires\npassed power down through family lines in what is known as a dynasty. These\nrulers families often made up the next level of the social hierarchy and had great\npower and wealth.\nThe middle of the social hierarchies tended to be made up of skilled workers and\ncraftsmen. These workers were responsible for the \u201cday-to-day\u201d work of the\nempire. They were the sculptors, carpenters, traders, and merchants who helped\nempires to run smoothly.

It is safe to say, however, that we can organize potential causes\nexternal causes\ninto different categories to help make sense of everything. The simplest way to\nbreak this down is to decide if the causes were internal or external. Internal\ncauses were things that happened within the empire to cause it to splinter and\nfracture. This could be things like unfair taxes, tension within social hierarchies,\npoor leadership, religious beliefs, or bad laws. External causes were things that\nhappened to an empire from outside forces. This could be things like being\nattacked by an outside group, natural disasters, diseases, and having extensive\nborders.

Aksum was a very\npowerful region of Africa because of the trade routes along the\nRed Sea. Aksum was considered a major trade partner with the\nRoman Empire and Ancient India. Traders from Central Africa,\nEgypt, Rome, Persia, and India all came to Aksum to trade for\nsalt, gold, ivory, gems, cloth, glass, and olive oil.

You read about the\n165 Swahili Coast\nJust south of where Aksum once was is the Swahili Coast, a\nregion made up of many city-states. This region succeeded due\nto trade networks that spanned the Indian Ocean. The eastern\ncoast of Africa had two dramatic changes around 1000 CE. First,\nthe Bantu migrated from West Africa and settled along the\neastern coast from Kenya to South Africa. Second, merchants\nand traders from the Muslim world and India realized the\nimportance of trade along the east coast of Africa. There were\nmany opportunities for wealth, so they began to settle there.\nFrom 900 AD onwards, the east coast of Africa saw an increase\nof Arab and Indian settlements. Over time, the coastal areas\nstarted to be controlled by Muslim merchants from Arabia and\nPersia.\nThe language that grew out of the mix of Arabs and Bantu is\nSwahili or Kiswahili (from the Arabic word sawahil which means\n\"coast\").

Here is\na quote about their trading habits.\nThe empire of Ghana was located in West Africa and ruled from\n300 CE to about 1200 CE. Ghana means \u2018warrior king\u2019 and had a \u201cIf you could choose between a pile of salt and a pile of gold, you\nfeudal government with local kings paying homage to the high would probably choose the gold.

But what if you could not easily get salt, and\nsalt, ivory, and the crafts of local artisans. Ghana established without it you could not survive? In fact, throughout history salt\ntrade routes with peoples from Northern Africa and the Middle has been very difficult to obtain in many parts of the world, and\nEast. Caravans of camels were used to travel the Sahara Desert people feared a lack of salt the way we in the industrialized world\nand carry these commodities. fear a shortage of fuel oil.\nOnce cultures began relying on grain, vegetable, or boiled meat\ndiets instead of mainly hunting and eating roasted meat, adding\nsalt to food became an absolute necessity for maintaining life.\nBecause the Akan lived in the forests of West Africa, they had few\nnatural resources for salt and always needed to trade for it. Gold,\nhowever, was much easier to come by. Every Akan knew how to\nfind tiny grains of gold sparkling in the river beds after a rainfall.\nThe people who lived in the desert of North Africa could easily\nmine salt, but not gold. They craved the precious metal that\nwould add so much to their personal splendor and prestige.\nThese mutual needs led to the establishment of long-distance\ntrade routes that connected very different cultures.\nCamel caravans from North Africa carried bars of salt as well as\ncloth, tobacco, and metal tools across the Sahara to trading\ncenters like Djenne and Timbuktu on the Niger River.

Like\nGhana, Mali\u2019s most successful trade goods were gold and salt.\nThe religion of Islam was a very important part of the Mali Empire.\nThe most famous Mali leader was Mansa Musa who became\nfamous by making a pilgrimage to Mecca known to Muslims as\nthe Hajj, which is expected of all Muslims once in their lifetime.\nMansa Musa\u2019s epic trip across North Africa increased the cultural\ndiffusion between Mali and the cities along the route to Mecca.\nMansa Musa is still considered to be one of the richest humans in\nhistory.\nHe spread gold along the trade routes of the Sahara, Europe, and\nthe Middle East and brought back many scholars to help make\nhis kingdom stronger. Mansa Musa also built a capital at\nTimbuktu where he built schools, libraries, and mosques. Mali\ncontrolled the trade routes through the Sahara and gained much\nwealth through trading salt and gold. Mansa Musa died in 1332\nCE and without his strong leadership, the empire weakened as\nnearby areas became independent. Mali\u2019s capital of Timbuktu\nwas lost to the Tuareg peoples in the 1430\u2019s and was eventually\ntaken over by the Songhai Empire in the 1460\u2019s.\n169 Songhai- Planned Government\nThe Songhai of West Africa were located along the Niger River.\nThe Empire lasted from 1464-1591 CE. The emperor Askia\nMuhammad brought Songhai to its height of power taking control\nof the gold and salt trade from Mali. Most Songhai people of this\ntime made their living by herding animals. Being a devout Muslim\nAskia, Muhammad took over the surrounding lands and spread\nIslam as he went.
