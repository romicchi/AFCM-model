It spells out in all detail what is often treated too\nbriefly or vaguely becauseof lack of time or space. It can be used either for sup-\nplementary reading or as a half-year course. It is self-contained, though usually\nthe student will have had elementary calculus before starting it. Without the\n\u201cstarred\u201d sections and problems, it can be (and was) taught even to freshmen.\nThe three chapters are fairly independent and, with small adjustments, may\nbe taught in arbitrary order. The chapter on n-space \u201cimitates\u201d the geometry\nof lines and planes in 3-space, and ensures a thorough review of the latter, for\nstudents who may not have had it. A wealth of problems, some simple, some\nchallenging, follow almost every section.\nSeveral years\u2019 class testing led the author to these conclusions:\n(1) The earlier such a course is given, the more time is gained in the follow-\nup courses, be it algebra, analysis or geometry. The longer students\nare taught \u201cvague analysis\u201d, the harder it becomes to get them used to\nrigorous proofs and formulations and the harder it is for them to get rid of\nthe misconceptionthatmathematicsis justmemorizingandmanipulating\nsome formulas.\n(2) When teaching the course to freshmen, it is advisable to start with Sec-\ntions 1\u20137 of Chapter 2, then pass to Chapter 3, leaving Chapter 1 and\nSections 8\u201310 of Chapter 2 for the end. The students should be urged to\npreread the material to be taught next. (Freshmen must learn to read\nmathematics by rereading what initially seems \u201cfoggy\u201d to them.) The\nteacher then may confine himself to a brief summary, and devote most\nof his time to solving as many problems (similar to those assigned) as\npossible. This is absolutely necessary.\n(3) An early and constant use of logical quantifiers (even in the text) is ex-\ntremely useful. Quantifiers are there to stay in mathematics.\n(4) Motivations are necessary and good, provided they are brief and do not\nuse terms that are not yet clear to students.  About the Author\nElias Zakon was born in Russia under the czar in 1908, and he was swept\nalong in the turbulence of the great events of twentieth-century Europe.\nZakon studied mathematics and law in Germany and Poland, and later he\njoined his father\u2019s law practice in Poland. Fleeing the approach of the German\nArmy in 1941, he took his family to Barnaul, Siberia, where, with the rest of\nthe populace, they endured five years of hardship. The Leningrad Institute of\nTechnology was also evacuated to Barnaul upon the siege of Leningrad, and\nthere he met the mathematician I. P. Natanson; with Natanson\u2019s encourage-\nment, Zakon again took up his studies and research in mathematics.\nZakon and his family spent the years from 1946 to 1949 in a refugee camp\nin Salzburg, Austria, where he taught himself Hebrew, one of the six or seven\nlanguages in which he became fluent. In 1949, he took his family to the newly\ncreated state of Israel and he taught at the Technion in Haifa until 1956. In\nIsrael he published his first research papers in logic and analysis.\nThroughout his life, Zakon maintained a love of music, art, politics, history,\nlaw, and especially chess; it was in Israel that he achieved the rank of chess\nmaster.\nIn 1956, Zakon moved to Canada. As a research fellow at the University of\nToronto, heworkedwith AbrahamRobinson. In1957, hejoinedthemathemat-\nics faculty at the University of Windsor, where the first degrees in the newly\nestablished Honours program in Mathematics were awarded in 1960. While\nat Windsor, he continued publishing his research results in logic and analysis.\nIn this post-McCarthy era, he often had as his house-guest the prolific and\neccentric mathematician Paul Erd\u02ddos, who was then banned from the United\nStates for his political views. Erd\u02ddos would speak at the University of Windsor,\nwhere mathematicians from the University of Michigan and other American\nuniversities would gather to hear him and to discuss mathematics.\nWhileatWindsor,Zakondevelopedthreevolumesonmathematicalanalysis,\nwhich were bound and distributed to students. His goal was to introduce\nrigorous material as early as possible; later courses could then rely on this\nmaterial. We are publishing here the latest complete version of the first of\nthese volumes, which was used in a one-semester class required of all first-year\nScience students at Windsor.  Chapter 1\nSome Set Theoretical Notions\n\u00a71. Introduction. Sets and Their Elements\nThe theory of sets, initiated by Georg Cantor (1845\u20131918), constitutes the\nbasis of almost all modern mathematics. The set concept itself cannot be\ndefined in simpler terms. A set is often described as a collection (\u201caggregate\u201d,\n\u201cclass\u201d, \u201ctotality\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d) of objects of any specified kind. However, such\ndescriptions are no definitions, as they merely replace the term \u201cset\u201d by other\nundefined terms. Thus the term \u201cset\u201d must be accepted as a primitive notion,\nwithout definition. Examples of sets are as follows: the set of all men; the set\nof all letters appearing on this page; the set of all straight lines in a given plane;\nthe set of all positive integers; the set of all English songs; the set of all books\nin a library; the set consisting of the three numbers 1, 4, 17. Sets will usually\nbe denoted by capital letters, A, B, C, ..., X, Y, Z.\nThe objects belonging to a set A are called its elements or members. We\nwrite x A if x is an element of the set A, and x / A if it is not.\n\u2208 \u2208\nExample.\nIf N is the set of all positive integers, then 1 N, 3 N, +\u221a9 N, but\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208\n\u221a7 / N, 0 / N, 1 / N, 1 / N.\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2212 \u2208 2 \u2208\nIt is also convenient to introduce the so-called empty (\u201cvoid\u201d, \u201cvacuous\u201d)\nset, denoted by , i.e., a set that contains no elements at all. Instead of saying\n\u2205\nthat there are no objects of some specific kind, we shall say that the set of these\nelements is empty; however, this set itself, though empty, will be regarded as\nan existing thing.\nOnce a set has been formed, it is regarded as a new entity, that is, a new\nobject, different from any of its elements. This object may, in its turn, be an\nelement of some other set. In fact, we can consider whole collections of sets\n(also called \u201cfamilies of sets\u201d, \u201cclasses of sets\u201d, etc.), i.e., sets whose elements\nare other sets. Thus, if is a collection of certain sets A, B, C, ..., then\nM\nthese sets are elements of , i.e., we have A , B , C , ...;\nM \u2208 M \u2208 M \u2208 M 2 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nbut the single elements of A need not be members of , and the same applies\nM\nto single elements of B, C, .... Briefly, from p A and A , it does\n\u2208 \u2208 M\nnot follow that p . This may be illustrated by the following examples.\n\u2208 M\nLet a \u201cnation\u201d be defined as a certain set of individuals, and let the United\nNations (U.N.) be regarded as a certain set of nations. Then single persons are\nelements of the nations, and the nations are members of U.N., but individuals\nare not members of U.N. Similarly, the Big Ten consists of ten universities,\neach university contains thousands of students, but no student is one of the\nBig Ten. Families of sets will usually be denoted by script letters: , , ,\nM N P\netc.\nIf all elements of a set A are also elements of a set B, we say that A is a\nsubset of B, and write A B. In this instance, we also say that B is a superset\n\u2286\nof A, and we can write B A. The set B is equal to A if A B and B A,\n\u2287 \u2286 \u2286\ni.e., the two sets consist of exactly the same elements. If, however, A B but\n\u2286\nB = A (i.e., B contains some elements not in A), then A is referred to as a\n6\nproper subset of B; in this case we shall use the notation A B. The empty\n\u2282\nset is considered a subset of any set; it is a proper subset of any nonempty\n\u2205\nset. The equality of two sets A and B is expressed by the formula A = B.1\nInstead of A B we shall also write B A; similarly, we write B A instead\n\u2286 \u2287 \u2283\nof A B. The relation \u201c \u201d is called the inclusion relation.2 Summing up, for\n\u2282 \u2286\nany sets A, B, C, the following are true:\n(a) A A.\n\u2286\n(b) If A B and B C, then A C.\n\u2286 \u2286 \u2286\n(c) If A B and B A, then A = B.\n\u2286 \u2286\n(d) A.\n\u2205 \u2286\n(e) If A , then A = .\n\u2286 \u2205 \u2205\nThe properties (a), (b), (c) are usually referred to as the reflexivity, tran-\nsitivity, and anti-symmetry of the inclusion relation, respectively; (c) is also\ncalled the axiom of extensionality.3\nA set A may consist of a single element p; in this case we write A = p .\n{ }\nThis set must not be confused with the element p itself, especially if p itself is\na set consisting of some elements a, b, c, ..., (recall that these elements are not\nregarded as elements of A; thus A consists of a single element p, whereas p may\nhave many elements; A and p then are not identical). Similarly, the empty set\n1The equality sign, here and in the sequel, is tantamount to logical identity. A formula\nlike \u201cA=B\u201d means that the letters A and B denote one and the same thing.\n2Some authors write A B for A B. We prefer, however, to reserve the sign for\n\u2282 \u2286 \u2282\nproper inclusion.\n3The statement that A = B if A and B have the same elements shall be treated as an\naxiom, not a definition. 1.

If A\nconsists of a small number of elements, it may be convenient to list them all in\nbraces. In particular, if A consists of two elements a, b, we write A = a, b .\n{ }\nSimilarly for a set of three elements, A = a, b, c , etc. If confusion is unlikely,\n{ }\na finite set may be indicated by the use of dots and a terminal member, as with\n1, 2, 3, ..., 10 , or 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 , or 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n 1 .\n{ } { } { \u2212 }\nIt should be noted that the order in which the elements of a set follow each\nother does not affect the equality of sets as stated above. For instance, we\nhave a, b = b, a because the two sets consist of the same elements. Also,\n{ } { }\nif some element is mentioned several times, it still counts as one element only.\nThus we have a, a = a . In this respect, a set consisting of two elements a\n{ } { }\nand b must be distinguished from the ordered pair (a,b); and, more generally, a\nset consisting of n elements, x , x , ..., x , should not be confused with the\n1 2 n\n{ }\nordered n-tuple (x ,...,x ). Two ordered pairs (a,b) and (x,y) are considered\n1 n\nequal iff4 a = x and b = y, whereas the sets a, b and x, y are also equal if\n{ } { }\na = y and b = x. A similar distinction applies to ordered n-tuples.5\nIf P(x) is some proposition or formula involving a variable x, we shall use\nthe symbol\nx P(x)\n{ | }\nto denote the set of all objects x for which the formula P(x) is true. For\ninstance, the set of all men can be denoted by x x is a man . Similarly,\n{ | }\nx x is a number, x < 5 stands for \u201cthe set of all numbers less than 5.\u201d\n{ | }\nWe write x A P(x) for \u201cthe set of all elements of A for which P(x) is\n{ \u2208 | }\ntrue.\u201d The variable x in such symbols may be replaced by any other variable;\nx P(x) is the same as y P(y) .\n{ | } { | }\nThus the set of all positive integers less than 5 can be denoted either by\n1, 2, 3, 4 , or by x x is an integer, 0 < x < 5 . Note: The comma in such\n{ } { | }\nsymbols stands for the word \u201cand\u201d.\n\u00a72. Operations on Sets\nWe now proceed to define some operations on sets.\n4\u201ciff\u201d means \u201cif and only if\u201d.\n5We shall not attempt at this stage to give a definition of an ordered pair or n-tuple,\nthough this can be done (cf. Problem 6 after 2).\n\u00a7 4 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nDefinition 1.\nFor any two sets A and B, we define as follows:\n(a) The union, or join, of A and B, denoted by A B, is the set of all\n\u222a\nelements x such that x A or x B (i.e., the set of all elements of\n\u2208 \u2208\nA and B taken together).1\n(b) The intersection, or meet, of A and B, denoted by A B, is the set\n\u2229\nof all elements x such that x A and x B simultaneously (it is\n\u2208 \u2208\nthe set of all common elements of A and B).\n(c) The difference A B is the set of all elements that are in A but not\n\u2212\nin B (B may, but need not, be a subset of A).\nIn symbols,\nA B = x x A or x B , A B = x x A, x B , and\n\u222a { | \u2208 \u2208 } \u2229 { | \u2208 \u2208 }\nA B = x x A, x / B .\n\u2212 { | \u2208 \u2208 }\nThe sets A and B are said to be disjoint iff A B = , i.e., iff they have\n\u2229 \u2205\nno elements in common. The symbols and are called \u201ccup\u201d and \u201ccap\u201d,\n\u222a \u2229\nrespectively; sometimes the symbols + and are used instead. Note that, if A\n\u00b7\nand B have some elements in common, these elements need not be mentioned\ntwice when forming the union A B. The difference A B is also called the\n\u222a \u2212\ncomplement of B relative to A (briefly, \u201cin A\u201d).2\nExamples.\n(1) If A = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and B = 2, 4, 6 , then\n{ } { }\nA B = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , A B = 2, 4 ,\n\u222a { } \u2229 { }\nA B = 1, 3, 5 , B A = 6 .\n\u2212 { } \u2212 { }\n(2) If A is the set of all soldiers and B the set of all students, then A B\n\u222a\nconsists of all persons who are either soldiers or students or both; A B\n\u2229\nis the set of all studying soldiers; A B is the set of all soldiers who do\n\u2212\nnot study; and B A consists of those students who are not soldiers.\n\u2212\nWhenspeakingofsets, weshallalwaystacitlyassumethatwearegivensome\n\u201cmaster set\u201d, called the space, from which our initial elements are selected.\nFrom these elements we then form the various sets (subsets of the space);\nthen we proceed to form families of sets, etc. The space will often remain\nunspecified, so that we retain the possibility of changing it if required. If S is\n1The word \u201cor\u201d is used in mathematics in the inclusive sense; that is, \u201cx A or x B\u201d\n\u2208 \u2208\nmeans \u201cx A or x B or both\u201d.\n\u2208 \u2208\n2Some authors write A B for A B; some use this notation only if B A. Others use\n\\ \u2212 \u2286\nthe terms \u201csum\u201d and \u201cproduct\u201d for \u201cunion\u201d and \u201cintersection\u201d, respectively. We shall not\nfollow this practice. 2. Operations on Sets 5\n\u00a7\nthe space, and E is its subset (i.e., E S), we call the difference S E simply\n\u2286 \u2212\nthe complement of E and denote it briefly by E; thus E = S E (provided\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nthat S is the space and E S).3\n\u2286\nThe notions of union, intersection, and difference can be graphically illus-\ntrated by means of so-called \u201cVenn diagrams\u201d4 on which they appear as the\nshaded areas of two or more intersecting circles or other suitable areas. In Fig-\nures 1, 2, and 3, we provide Venn diagrams illustrating the union, intersection,\nand difference of two sets A and B.\nA B A B A B\nFigure 1: A B Figure 2: A B Figure 3: A B\n\u222a \u2229 \u2212\nTheorem 1. For any sets A, B, and C, we have the following:\n(a) A A = A; A A = A (idempotent laws).\n\u222a \u2229\n(b) A B = B A; A B = B A (commutative laws).\n\u222a \u222a \u2229 \u2229\n(c) (A B) C = A (B C)\n\u222a \u222a \u222a \u222a (associative laws).\n(d) (A B) C = A (B C)\n)\n\u2229 \u2229 \u2229 \u2229\n(e) (A B) C = (A C) (B C)\n\u222a \u2229 \u2229 \u222a \u2229 (distributive laws).\n(f) (A B) C = (A C) (B C)\n)\n\u2229 \u222a \u222a \u2229 \u222a\n(g) A = A; A = ; A = A; A A = .\n\u222a\u2205 \u2229\u2205 \u2205 \u2212\u2205 \u2212 \u2205\nTo verify these formulas, we have to check, each time, that every element\ncontained in the set occurring on the left-hand side of the equation also belongs\nto the right-hand side, and conversely. For example, we shall verify formula (e),\nleaving the proof of the remaining formulas to the reader. Suppose then that\nsome element x belongs to the set (A B) C; this means that x (A B)\n\u222a \u2229 \u2208 \u222a\nand, simultaneously, x C; in other words, we have x A or x B and,\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208\nsimultaneously, x C. It follows that we have (x A and x C) or (x B\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208 \u2208\nand x C); that is, x (A C) or x (B C), whence x [(A C) (B C)].\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2229 \u2208 \u2229 \u2208 \u2229 \u222a \u2229\nThus we see that every element x contained in the left-hand side of (e) is also\ncontained in the right-hand side.

The symbol is used for \u201ciff\u201d (\u201cif\n\u21d2 \u21d0\u21d2\nand only if\u201d). For instance,\n\u201c( x N) [x > 3 x 4]\u201d\n\u2200 \u2208 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2265\nmeans \u201cFor natural numbers x, we have x > 3 if and only if x 4.\u201d\n\u2265\nNegations. In mathematics, we often have to form the negation of a for-\nmulathatstartswithoneorseveralquantifiers. Thenitisnoteworthythateach\nuniversal quantifier is replaced by an existential one (and vice versa), followed\nby the negation of the subsequent part of the original formula. For example, in\ncalculus, a real number p is called the limit of a sequence x , x , ..., x , ...\n1 2 n\niff the following is true: \u201cFor every real \u03b5 > 0, there is a natural k (depending\non \u03b5) such that for all integers n > k, we have x p < \u03b5.\u201d If we agree that\nn\n| \u2212 |\nlower-case letters (possibly with subscripts) denote real numbers, and that n,\nk denote naturals, this sentence can be written thus:\n( \u03b5 > 0) ( k) ( n > k) x p < \u03b5. (2)\nn\n\u2200 \u2203 \u2200 | \u2212 |\nHere \u201c( \u03b5 > 0)\u201d and \u201c( n > k)\u201d stand for \u201c( \u03b5 \u03b5 > 0)\u201d and \u201c( n n > k)\u201d.\n\u2200 \u2200 \u2200 | \u2200 |\nSuch self-explanatory abbreviations will also be used in other similar cases.\nNow let us form the negation of (2). As (2) states that \u201cfor all \u03b5 > 0\u201d\nsomething (i.e., the rest of the formula) is true, the negation of (2) starts with\n\u201cthere is an \u03b5 > 0\u201d (for which the rest of the formula fails). Thus we start\nwith \u201c( \u03b5 > 0)\u201d and form the negation of the rest of the formula, i.e., of \u201c( k)\n\u2203 \u2203\n( n > k) x p < \u03b5\u201d. This negation, in turn, starts with \u201c( k)\u201d (why?), and\nn\n\u2200 | \u2212 | \u2200 14 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nso on. Step by step, we finally arrive at\n( \u03b5 > 0) ( k) ( n > k) x p \u03b5,\nn\n\u2203 \u2200 \u2203 | \u2212 | \u2265\ni.e., \u201cthere is at least one \u03b5 > 0 such that, for every natural k, one can find an\ninteger n > k, with x p \u03b5\u201d. Note that here the choice of n may depend\nn\n| \u2212 | \u2265\non k. To stress it, we write n for n. Thus the negation of (2) emerges as\nk\n( \u03b5 > 0) ( k) ( n > k) x p \u03b5. (3)\nk nk\n\u2203 \u2200 \u2203 | \u2212 | \u2265\nRule: To form the negation of a quantified formula, replace all universal\nquantifiers by existential ones, and conversely; finally, replace the remaining\n(unquantified) formula by its negation. Thus, in (2), \u201c x p < \u03b5\u201d must be\nn\n| \u2212 |\nreplaced by \u201c x p \u03b5\u201d, or rather by \u201c x p \u03b5\u201d, as explained.\nn nk\n| \u2212 | \u2265 | \u2212 | \u2265\nNote 1. Formula (3) is also the negation of (2) when (2) is written as\n\u201c( \u03b5 > 0) ( k) ( n) [n > k = x p < \u03b5]\u201d.\nn\n\u2200 \u2203 \u2200 \u21d2 | \u2212 |\nIn general, to form the negation of a formula containing the implication sign\n= , it is advisable first to re-write all without that sign, using the notation\n\u21d2\n\u201c( x ...)\u201d (here: \u201c( n n > k)\u201d).\n\u2200 | \u2200 |\nNote 2. Theuniversal quantifierinaformula( x A)P(x)does not imply\n\u2200 \u2208\nthe existence of an x for which P(x) is true. It is only meant to imply that\nthere is no x in A for which P(x) fails. This remains true even if A = ; we\n\u2205\nthen say that \u201c( x A) P(x)\u201d is vacuously true. For example, the statement\n\u2200 \u2208\n\u201call witches are beautiful\u201d is vacuously true because there are no witches at\nall; but so also is the statement \u201call witches are ugly\u201d. Similarly, the formula\nB, i.e., ( x ) x B, is vacuously true.\n\u2205 \u2286 \u2200 \u2208 \u2205 \u2208\nProblem. Redo Problems 11 and 13 of 2 using quantifiers.\n\u00a7\n\u00a74. Relations (Correspondences)\nWe already have occasionally used terms like \u201crelation\u201d, \u201coperation\u201d, etc., but\nthey did not constitute part of our theory. In this and the next sections, we\nshall give a precise definition of these concepts and dwell on them more closely.\nOur definition will be based on the concept of an ordered pair. As has\nalready been mentioned, by an ordered pair (briefly \u201cpair\u201d) (x,y), we mean\ntwo (possibly equal) objects x and y given in a definite order, so that one of\nthem, x, becomes the first (or left) and the other, y, is the second (or right)\npart of the pair.1 We recall that two pairs (a,b) and (x,y) are equal iff their\ncorresponding members are the same, that is, iff a = x and b = y. The pair\n1For a more precise definition (avoiding the undefined term \u201corder\u201d), see Problem 6 after\n2.\n\u00a7 4. Relations (Correspondences) 15\n\u00a7\n(y,x) shouldbedistinguishedfrom (x,y); it is calledthe inverse to (x,y). Once\na pair (x,y) has been formed, it is treated as a new thing (i.e., as one object,\ndifferent from x and y taken separately); x and y are called the coordinates of\nthe pair (x,y).\nNothing prevents us, of course, from considering also sets of ordered pairs,\ni.e., sets whose elements are pairs, (each pair being regarded as one element of\nthe set). If the pair (x,y) is an element of such a set R, we write (x,y) R.\n\u2208\nNote: This does not imply that x and y taken separately, are elements of R;\n(then we write x, y R).\n\u2208\nDefinition 1.\nBy a relation, or correspondence, we mean any set of ordered pairs.2\nIf R is a relation, and (x,y) R, then y is called an R-relative of x (but\n\u2208\nx is not called an R-relative of y unless (y,x) R); we also say in this case\n\u2208\nthat y is R-related to x or that the relation R holds between x and y. Instead\nof (x,y) R, we also write xRy. The letter R, designating a relation, may be\n\u2208\nreplaced by other letters; it is often replaced by special symbols like <, >, ,\n\u223c\n, etc.\n\u2261\nExamples.\n(1) Let R be the set of all pairs (x,y) of integers x and y such that x is\nless than y.3 Then R is a relation (called \u201cinequality relation between\nintegers\u201d). The formula xRy means in this case that x and y are integers,\nwith x less than y. Usually the letter R is here replaced by the special\nsymbol <, so that \u201cxRy\u201d turns into \u201cx < y\u201d.\n(2) The inclusion relation introduced in 1 may be interpreted as the set\n\u2286 \u00a7\nof all pairs (X,Y) where X and Y are subsets of a given space, with X a\nsubset of Y. Similarly, the -relation is the set of all pairs (x,A) where\n\u2208\nA is a subset of the space and x is an element of A.\n(3) is a relation (\u201can empty set of pairs\u201d).\n\u2205\nIf P(x,y) is a proposition or formula involving the variables x and y, we\ndenote by (x,y) P(x,y) the set of all ordered pairs for which the formula\n{ | }\nP(x,y) is true. For example, the set of all married couples could be denoted\nby (x,y) x is the wife of y .4 Any such set is a relation.\n{ | }\n2This use of the term \u201crelation\u201d may seem rather strange to a reader unfamiliar with\nexact mathematical terminology. The justification of this definition is in that it fits exactly\nall mathematical purposes, as will be seen later, and makes the notion of relation precise,\nreducing it to that of a \u201cset\u201d.\n3Though the theory of integers and real numbers will be formally introduced only in\nChapter 2, we feel free to use them in illustrative examples.\n4This set could be called \u201cthe relation of being married\u201d. 16 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nSince relations are sets, the equality of two relations, R and S, means that\nthey consist of exactly the same elements (ordered pairs); that is, we have\nR = S iff xRy always implies xSy, and vice versa. Similarly, R S means\n\u2286\nthat xRy always implies xSy (but the converse need not be true).\nBy replacing all pairs (x,y) belonging to a relation R by their inverses (y,x)\nwe obtain a new relation, called the inverse of R and denoted by R\u22121. Clearly,\nwe have xR\u22121y iff yRx; thus\nR\u22121 = (x,y) yRx = (y,x) xRy .\n{ | } { | }\nThis shows that R, in its turn, is the inverse of R\u22121; i.e., (R\u22121)\u22121 = R. For\nexample, the relations < and > between numbers are inverse to each other; so\nalso are the relations and between sets.\n\u2286 \u2287\nIf a correspondence R contains the ordered pairs (x,x\u2032), (y,y\u2032), (z,z\u2032), ...,\nwe shall write\nx y z ...\nR = , (1)\nx\u2032 y\u2032 z\u2032 ...\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\ni.e., the pairs will be written in vertical notation, so that each left coordinate\nof a pair is written above the corresponding right coordinate (i.e., above its\nR-relative). Thus, e.g., the symbol\n1 4 1 3\n(2)\n2 2 1 1\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\ndenotes the relation consisting of the four pairs (1,2), (4,2), (1,1), and (3,1).\nThe inverse relation is obtained by simply interchanging the upper and the\nlower rows.\nDefinition 2.\nThe set of all left coordinates of pairs contained in a relation R is called\nthe domain of R, denoted D . The set of all right coordinates of these\nR\npairs is called the range or co-domain of R, denoted D\u2032 . Clearly, x D\nR \u2208 R\niff xRy for some y. Thus (note these formulas)\nD = x xRy for some y ; D\u2032 = y xRy for some x ;\nR { | } R { | }\nor, using quantifiers,\nD = x ( y) xRy ; D\u2032 = y ( x) xRy .\nR { | \u2203 } R { | \u2203 }\nIn symbols of the form (1), the domain and range appear as the upper and\nthe lower row, respectively; thus, e.g., in (2) the domain is 1, 4, 3 and the\n{ }\nrangeis 2, 1 . Clearly, if allpairs ofa relation R arereplacedby their inverses,\n{ }\nthen the left coordinates turn into the right ones, and conversely. Therefore, 4. Relations (Correspondences) 17\n\u00a7\nthe domain of the inverse relation R\u22121 coincides with the range of R, and the\nrange of R\u22121 is the domain of R; that is,\nD R\u22121 = D R\u2032 , D R\u2032 \u22121 = D R. (3)\nDefinition 3.\nGiven a relation R and any set A we say that R is\n(i) reflexive on A iff we have xRx for all elements x of A;\n(ii) symmetric on A iff xRy implies yRx for any x and y in A;\n(iii) transitive on A iff xRy combined with yRz implies xRz for all x, y,\nand z in A;\n(iv) trichotomic on A iff, for any x and y in A, we always have either\nxRy, or yRx, or x = y, but never two of these together.\nExamples.\n(a) The inequality relation < between real numbers is transitive and tri-\nchotomic because x < y and y < z always implies x < z (transitivity);\nand we always have either x < y, or y < x, or x = y (trichotomy); we\nshall dwell on these properties more closely in Chapter 2.\n(b) The inclusion relation between sets is reflexive (because A A) and\n\u2286 \u2286\ntransitive (because A B and B C implies A C); but it is neither\n\u2286 \u2286 \u2286\nsymmetric nor trichotomic, the latter because it may well happen that\nneither of two sets contains the other, and because A B and A = B\n\u2286\nmay both hold.\n(c) The relation of proper inclusion, , is only transitive.\n\u2282\n(d) The equality relation, =, is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive because\nwe always have x = x, x = y always implies y = x, and x = y = z implies\nx = z. It is, however, not trichotomic. (Why?)\n(e) The relation between an element and a set is neither reflexive nor\n\u2208\nsymmetric, nor transitive, nor trichotomic (on the set consisting of all\nA\nelements and all subsets of a given space).\nDefinition 4.\nThe image of a set A under a relation R (briefly, the R-image of A) is\nthe set of all R-relatives of elements of A; it is denoted by R[A] (square\nbrackets always!). The inverse image (the R\u22121-image) of A, denoted\nR\u22121[A], is the image of A under the inverse relation, R\u22121. The R-image\nof a single element x (or of the set x ) is simply the set of all R-relatives\n{ }\nof x. It is customary to denote it by R[x] instead of the more precise\nnotation R[ x ]. Note: R[A] may be empty!\n{ } 18 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nTo form R[A], we first find the R-relatives of every element x of A (if any),\nthus obtaining R[x] for each x A. The union of all these R[x] combined is\n\u2208\nthe desired image R[A].\nExample.\nLet\n1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 4\nR = .\n1 3 4 5 3 4 1 3 5 1\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nThen R[1] = 1, 3, 4 ; R[2] = 3, 5 ; R[3] = 1, 3, 4, 5 ; R[5] = ;\n{ } { } { } \u2205\nR\u22121[1] = 1, 3, 4 ; R\u22121[2] = ; R\u22121[3] = 1, 2, 3 ; R\u22121[4] = 1, 3 .\n{ } \u2205 { } { }\nIf, further, A = 1, 2 and B = 2, 4 , then R[A] = 1, 3, 4, 5 ;\n{ } { } { }\nR[B] = 1, 3, 5 ; R\u22121[A] = 1, 3, 4 ; and R\u22121[B] = 1, 3 .\n{ } { } { }\nBy definition, R[x] is the set of all R-relatives of x. Hence y R[x] means\n\u2208\nthat y is an R-relative of x, i.e., that (x,y) R, which can also be written as\n\u2208\nxRy. Thus the formulas\n(x,y) R, xRy and y R[x]\n\u2208 \u2208\nare equivalent. More generally, y R[A] means that y is an R-relative of some\n\u2208\nelement x A; i.e., there is x A such that (x,y) R. In symbols, y R[A]\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208 \u2208\nis equivalent to ( x A) (x,y) R, or ( x A) xRy.\n\u2203 \u2208 \u2208 \u2203 \u2208\nNote that the expressions R[A], R\u22121[A], R[x] and R\u22121[x] are defined even\nif A or x are not contained in the domain (or range) of R. These images may,\nhowever, be empty. In particular, R[x] = iff x / D .\nR\n\u2205 \u2208\nWe conclude this section with an important example of a relation. Given\nany two sets A and B, we can consider the set of all ordered pairs (x,y) with\nx A and y B. This set is called the Cartesian product, or cross product, of\n\u2208 \u2208\nA and B, denoted A B. Thus\n\u00d7\nA B = (x,y) x A, y B .\n\u00d7 { | \u2208 \u2208 }\nInparticular, A Ais thesetofallorderedpairsthatcanbeformedofelements\n\u00d7\nof A. Note: A = A = . (Why?)\n\u00d7\u2205 \u2205\u00d7 \u2205\nThe Cartesian product A B is a relation since it is a set of ordered pairs.\n\u00d7\nIts domain is A and its range is B (provided that A and B are not empty).\nMoreover, it is the \u201clargest\u201d possible relation with this domain and this range,\nbecauseanyotherrelationwiththesamedomainandrangeisasubsetofA B,\n\u00d7\ni.e., it contains only some of the ordered pairs contained in A B. Thus, to\n\u00d7\nform a relation with domain A and range B means to select certain pairs from\nA B. The inverse of A B is B A (the set of all inverse pairs).\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nOn the other hand, the formation of Cartesian products may also be treated\nas a new operation on sets (called cross multiplication).

Nevertheless, we can speak of cross\n\u00d7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 \u00d7\nproducts of more than two sets if we agree to write A B C for (A B) C\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n(but not for A (B C)).

Mappings\nWe shall now consider an especially important class of relations, called map-\npings or functions. The mapping concept is a generalization of that of a func-\ntion as usually given in calculus. 5. Mappings 23\n\u00a7\nDefinition 1.\nA relation R is a mapping, a map, or a function iff the image R[x] for\nevery element x D consists of a single element (in other words, every\nR\n\u2208\nelement x D has a unique relative under R). This unique element is\nR\n\u2208\ndenoted by R(x) and is called the function value at x. (Thus R(x) is the\nunique element of R[x].)1 Equivalently, R is a mapping iff no two pairs\nbelonging to R have the same first coordinate. (Explain!)\nIf, in addition, different elements of D have different images, R is\nR\ncalled a one-to-one-mapping or a one-to-one correspondence. In this case,\nx = y implies R(x) = R(y),\n6 6\nprovided that x, y D . Equivalently,\nR\n\u2208\nR(x) = R(y) implies x = y for x, y D .\nR\n\u2208\nMappings will usually be denoted by the letters f, g, h, F, \u03d5, \u03c8, etc.\nA mapping f is said to be \u201cfrom A to B\u201d if D = A and D\u2032 B. In\nf f \u2286\nthis case we write f: A B. If, in particular, D = A and D\u2032 = B, we\n\u2192 f f\nsay that f is a mapping of A onto B and write f: A B. If f is both\no\u2192nto\nonto and one-to-one, we write f: A B. We shall also use expressions\no\u2194nto\nlike \u201cf maps A into B\u201d and \u201cf maps A onto B\u201d instead of f: A B\n\u2192\nand f: A B, respectively.\no\u2192nto\nSince every element x D has a unique f-relative, f(x), under a mapping\nf\n\u2208\nf, all pairs belonging to f have the form (x,f(x)), where f(x) is the function\nvalue at x. Therefore, in order to define a function f, it suffices to define its\ndomain D and to indicate the function value f(x) for every x D .2 We\nf f\n\u2208\nshall often use such definitions.\nIt is customary to say that a function f is defined on a set A if A = D .3\nf\nExamples.\n(1) The relation R = (x,y) x is the wife of y is a one-to-one map of the\n{ | }\nset of all wives onto the set of all husbands. Under this map, every\nhusband is the (unique) R-relative of his wife. The inverse relation, R\u22121,\nis a one-to-one map of the set of all husbands onto the set of all wives.\n(2) The relation f = (x,y) y is the father of x is a mapping of the set of\n{ | }\nall people onto the set of their fathers. It is not one-to-one since several\n1R(x) is often called the image of x under R if confusion with R[x] is irrelevant. Note\nthat R(x) is defined only if x D , whereas R[x] is always defined. If x / D , R[x]= .\nR R\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2205\n2Note,however, thatitdoesnotsufficetogiveaformulaforf(x)only,withoutindicating\nthe domain D .\nf\n3In this connection, D is often referred to as the domain of definition of the function,\nf\nwhile D\u2032 is called its range of values.\nf 24 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\npersons may have one and the same father, and thus x = x\u2032 does not\n6\nimply f(x) = f(x\u2032).\n6\n(3) Let g be the set of the four pairs (1,2), (2,2), (3,3), (4,8). Then g is\na mapping from D = 1, 2, 3, 4 onto D\u2032 = 2, 3, 8 , with g(1) = 2,\ng { } g { }\ng(2) = 2, g(3) = 3, g(4) = 8. (Theseformulascouldserveasthedefinition\nof g.)4 It is not one-to-one since g(1) = g(2), i.e., two distinct elements\nof the domain have one and the same image.\n(4) Letthedomainofamappingf bethesetofallintegers, J, withf(x) = 2x\nfor every integer x. By what has been said above, f is well defined. f is\none-to-one since x = y implies 2x = 2y. The domain of f is J; its range,\n6 6\nhowever, consists of even integers only. Thus f: J J, but it is not onto\n\u2192\nJ. This example shows that a mapping may be one-to-one without being\nonto.5\n(5) The identity map (denoted I) is the set of all pairs of the form (x,x)\nwhere x ranges over some given space (i.e., it is the set of all pairs with\nequal left and right coordinates). It can also be defined by the formula\nI(x) = x for each x; that is, the function value at x is x itself. This map\nis clearly one-to-one and onto.6\nIf f is a mapping, its inverse, f\u22121, is always a certain relation (namely, the\nset of all ordered pairs inverse to those contained in f). However, this relation\nmay fail to be a mapping. For example, let\n1 2 3 4 2 3 3 8\nf = ; then f\u22121 = .\n2 3 3 8 1 2 3 4\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\nHere f is a mapping (see Example (3)), but f\u22121 is not, because f\u22121[3] = 2, 3\n{ }\nconsists of two elements (not of one). On the other hand, as is easily seen, the\nmappings given in Examples (1), (4), and (5) yields inverse relations that are\nmappings likewise. This justifies the following definition.\nDefinition 2.\nA mapping f is said to be invertible iff its inverse, f\u22121, is a map itself.\nIn this case f\u22121 is called the inverse map or inverse function.\nEquivalently,\na mapping (function) is invertible iff it is one-to-one.\n4As we have noted, such a definition suffices provided that the domain of the function is\nknown.\n5Note, however, that we may also regard it as a map of J onto the smaller set E of all\neven integers: f: J E.\no\u2194nto\n6We may also consider the relation (x,x) x A , denoted I , where A is a proper\nA\n{ | \u2208 }\nsubset of the given space S. Then I : A S is one-to-one but not onto S (it is onto A\nA\n\u2192\nonly). I is called the identity map on A.\nA 5. Mappings 25\n\u00a7\nFor, if f is one-to-one, then no distinct elements of its domain can have one\nand the same function value y. But this very fact means that f\u22121[y] cannot\nconsist of more than one element, i.e., that f\u22121 is a function.\nThe function value f(x) is also sometimes denoted by fx, xf, or f . In the\nx\nlatter case (called \u201cindex notation\u201d), the domain of f is also referred to as an\nindex set, and the range of f is denoted by f . It is convenient to regard x\nx\n{ }\nin such symbols as a variable ranging over the domain of f (index set). Then\nalso the function value f(x) (respectively, fx, xf, or f ) becomes a variable\nx\ndependingon x; we call it then the variable function value. If, in particular, D\nf\nand D\u2032 are sets of real numbers, we obtain what is called a real-valued function\nf\nof a real variable. Such functions are considered in the elementary calculus.\nOur function concept is, however, much more general since we consider maps\nwith arbitrary domains and ranges (not necessarily sets of numbers).\nNote 1. We shall strictly distinguish between the function value f(x) and\nthe function f itself. The latter is a set of ordered pairs while the former, f(x),\nis only a single (though possibly variable) element of the range of values of\nf. These two notions are very often confused in elementary calculus, e.g., in\nsuch expressions as \u201cthe function f(x) = 2x.\u201d What is actually meant is \u201cthe\nfunction f defined by the formula f(x) = 2x.\u201d Another correct way of express-\ning this is by saying that \u201cf is the function that carries (or transforms) each\nx D into 2x\u201d or, briefly, that \u201cf is the map x 2x\u201d or \u201cf assigns to x the\nf\n\u2208 \u2192\nvalue 2x,\u201d etc.\nNote 2. Mappings are also often referred to as transformations.\nNote 3. If index notation is used, the range of function values D\u2032 , also\nf\nwritten as f , can be regarded as a certain set of objects f that are\nx x\n{ } { }\ndistinguished from each other by the various values of the variable index x. We\nhave already encountered this notation in 2, with respect to families of sets.\n\u00a7\nAs we have already mentioned, the domain and range of a function f may\nbe quite arbitrary sets.7 In particular, we can consider functions in which\neach element of the domain is itself an ordered pair, (x,y). Such mappings\nare called functions of two variables. Similarly, we speak of a function of n\nvariables if the domain D of that function is a set of ordered n-tuples. To\nf\nany such n-tuple, (x ,x ,...,x ), the function f assigns a unique function\n1 2 n\nvalue, denoted by f(x ,x ,...,x ), provided that the n-tuple belongs to D .\n1 2 n f\nNote that each n-tuple (x ,...,x ) is treated as one element of D and is\n1 n f\nassigned only one function value. Usually (but not always) the domain D\nf\nconsists of all n-tuples that can be formed from elements of a given set A; that\nis, D = An (the Cartesian product of n sets, each equal to A). The range\nf\nmay be any arbitrary set. The formula f: An B is used to denote such a\n\u2192\n7Thesesetsmayevenbeempty. Thenalsof = (\u201canemptysetoforderedpairs\u201d). Thus\n\u2032 \u2205\nis a mapping, with D =D = .\n\u2205 f f \u2205 26 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nfunction. Similarly, we write f: (A B) C for a function of two variables,\n\u00d7 \u2192\nwith D = A B and D\u2032 C, etc.\nf \u00d7 f \u2286\nNote 4. Functions of two variables are also called (binary) operations.\nWhen this terminology is used, we usually replace the function symbols f,\ng, F, ... by special symbols +, , , , etc., and write x + y, x y, etc., in-\n\u00b7 \u222a \u2229 \u00b7\nstead of f(x,y). The function value f(x,y) then is called the sum (product,\ncomposite, etc.) of x and y.\nProblems on Mappings\n1. Which of the following relations, or their inverses, are mappings?\n(x,y) y is the mother of x ; (x,y) x is the father of y ;\n{ | } { | }\n(x,y) y is a child of x ; (x,y) x is a friend of y ;\n{ | } { | }\n(x,y) y is the oldest son of x ; (x,y) x is the oldest cousin of y ;\n{ | } { | }\n(x,y) x real, y = x2 ; (x,y) y real, x = y3 .\n{ | } { | }\n2.

Composition of Relations and Mappings\n1\nA relation R can be treated as a mechanism that transforms any given set A\ninto its image R[A]. If S is another relation, we can apply it to the set R[A]\nto obtain its image under S, i.e., S[R[A]]. Given a third relation T, we can\napply it to the set S[R[A]] to obtain its image, T [S[R[A]]], and so on. This\nprocess of successively applying several relations leads to the important notion\nof composition of relations. Before defining this notion, it is useful to prove the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma. Two relations R and S are equal iff R[x] = S[x] for every element\nx.\nProof. Recall that R and S are equal iff they consist of exactly the same\nordered pairs, that is, iff (x,y) R (x,y) S, for all x, y. But, as was\n\u2208 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2208\nshown in 4, this can also be written as\n\u00a7\ny R[x] y S[x] for all x and y.\n\u2208 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2208\nFixing x, we see from this that, whenever some element y belongs to the set\nR[x], it also belongs to S[x], and vice versa. In other words, the two sets R[x]\nand S[x] consist of the same elements. Thus we have\nR[x] = S[x] for every x,\nas required. The converse is obtained by reversing the steps of the proof. Thus\nthe lemma is proved. (cid:3)\n1This and other \u201cstarred\u201d sections may be omitted in the first reading of Chapter 1.\nIndeed, the beginner is advised to postpone them, pending further directives. \u2217 6. Composition of Relations and Mappings 29\n\u00a7\nThis lemma shows that a relation R is uniquely determined if the sets R[x]\nare given for all x. (Indeed, if any relation has the same image sets, it must\ncoincide with R, by the lemma.) Therefore, a relation can be defined by indi-\ncating the sets R[x] for all x.2 We shall now apply this method to define the\nnotion of the composite relation.\nDefinition.\nBy the composite of two relations R and S, denoted R S or RS, we mean\n\u25e6\nthe relation with images defined by\n(R S)[x] = R[S[x]] for every x. (1)\n\u25e6\nIn other words, the image of any element x under the composite relation\nR S is obtained by first taking its image under S, i.e., S[x], and then taking\n\u25e6\nthe image of the set S[x] under R. Thus all images under R S are well defined;\n\u25e6\nhence so is R S. Note that formula (1) defines implicitly also the domain of\n\u25e6\nR S; it consists of those x whose images under R S are nonvoid.\n\u25e6 \u25e6\nExample.\nLet\n1 2 3 2 3\nR = , S = .\n2 3 4 1 5\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\nThen RS consists of the pair (2,2) alone, while SR consists of (1,1) and\n(2,5). This example shows that RS = SR; that is, the composition of\n6\nrelations is, in general, not commutative (even when they are mappings,\nas in this example). It is, however, associative, as is shown next.\nTheorem 1. For any relations R, S, T, we have (RS)T = R(ST).\nProof. By the lemma, it suffices to show that ((RS)T)[x] = (R(ST))[x], for\nevery x. But, by definition (see formula (1) above), we obtain\n((RS)T)[x] = (RS)[T[x]] = R[S[T[x]]].\nSimilarly, (R(ST))[x] = R[S[T[x]]]. Thus the images coincide, as required,\nand all is proved. (cid:3)\nTheorem 2. For any relations R and S, we have (RS)\u22121 = S\u22121R\u22121.\nThe proof is left as an exercise (see Problem 4 below).\nTheorem 3. If R and S are functions, so also is RS. In particular, if R and\nS are one-to-one mappings, so is RS.\n2This is analogous to defining a function R by indicating R(x) for all x D . In the\nR\n\u2208\npresent case, however, it is unnecessary to specify D because R[x], unlike R(x), is defined\nR\nfor all x. 30 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nProof. Formula (1) above shows that (RS)[x] contains at most one element\nif R[S[x]] does, and this is clearly the case when S and R are mappings. The\nsecond clause likewise follows easily from Theorem 2.

Equivalence Relations\nIn mathematics, as in everyday life, it is often convenient not to distinguish\nbetween certain objects that, however different, serve the same purpose and\nthus may be \u201cidentified\u201d (i.e., regarded as the same) as far as this purpose is\nconcerned. For example, different coins and bills of the same value may be\nregarded as equivalent in all money transactions. Parallel lines may be treated\nas the same in all angle measurements. Congruent figures may be \u201cidentified\u201d\nin geometry. In all such cases some relation (like parallelism or congruence)\nplays the same role as equality. Such relations, called equivalence relations,\nresemble equality in that they are reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Usually\nthey also have, to a certain degree, the so-called substitution property; that is,\nwithin certain limits, equivalent objects may be substituted for each other. We\nnow give precise definitions.\nDefinition 1.\nA binary relation E is called an equivalence relation on a set A if E is\nreflexive, symmetric, and transitive on A and moreover its domain D\nE\nand its range D\u2032 coincide with A.1\nE\nEquivalence relations are usually denoted by special symbols resembling\nequality, such as , , , etc. The formula (x,y) E or xEy, where E\n\u2261 \u2248 \u223c \u2208\nis such a symbol, is read \u201cx is equivalent to y,\u201d \u201cx is congruent with y,\u201d\netc. Sometimes the phrase \u201cmodulo E\u201d is added. Thus we write x y, or\n\u2261\nx y (mod E), for xEy. If such a formula is true, we say that x and y are\n\u2261\nE-equivalent, or equivalent modulo E, or, briefly, equivalent.\nDefinition 2.\nAn equivalence relation E is said to have the substitution property with\nrespect to another relation R if xRy implies x\u2032Ry\u2032 whenever x x\u2032\n\u2261\n(mod E)andy y\u2032 (mod E). InthiscasewealsosaythatE isconsistent\n\u2261\nwith R. In other words, consistency means that the formula xRy does not\n1Note that the domain D of E must coincide with its range D\u2032 due to symmetry.\nE E\nExplain! \u2217 7. Equivalence Relations 33\n\u00a7\nalter its validity or nonvalidity if x and y are replaced by some equivalent\nelements, x\u2032 x, and y\u2032 y.\n\u2261 \u2261\nSimilarly, we say that E is consistent with an operation in a set A,\n\u25e6\nor that E has the substitution property with respect to , if x y x\u2032 y\u2032\n\u25e6 \u25e6 \u2261 \u25e6\nwhenever x, x\u2032, y, y\u2032 A, x\u2032 x, and y\u2032 y (all mod E).\n\u2208 \u2261 \u2261\nTheequalityrelation(i.e.,theidentitymaponasetA)isitselfanequivalence\nrelation since it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. It has the (unlimited)\nsubstitution property since we have defined it as logical identity. Other exam-\nples (such as parallelism of lines, or congruenceof figures) have been mentioned\nabove; see also the problems below.\nDefinition 3.\nIf E is an equivalence relation on A, and if p D , we define the E-class,\nE\n\u2208\nor equivalence class modulo E, generated by p in A to be the set of all\nthose elements of A that are E-equivalent to p. Thus it is the set\ny A pEy = E[p] (= image of p under E).\n{ \u2208 | }\nIf confusion is ruled out, we denote it simply by [p] and call it the E-class\nof p (in A); p is called a generator or representative of [p].2 The family of\nall E-classes, generated in A by different elements, is called the quotient\nset of A by E, denoted A/E. Note: By definition, x [p] iff x p.\n\u2208 \u2261\nExamples.\n(a) If E = I (the identity map on A), then E[x] = [p] = p for each p A.\nA\n{ } \u2208\nThus here each E-class consists of a single element (its generator).\n(b) Under the parallelism relation between straight lines, an equivalence class\nconsists of all lines parallel to a given line in space.\n(c) Under congruence, an equivalence class consists of all figures congruent\nto a given figure.\nTheorem 1. If E is an equivalence relation on a set A, then we have the\nfollowing:\n(i) Every element p A is in some E-class; specifically, p [p] A.\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2286\n(ii) Two elements p, q A are E-equivalent iff they are in one and the same\n\u2208\nequivalence class, i.e., iff [p] = [q].\n(iii) Any two E-classes in Q are either identical or disjoint.\n(iv) The set A is the (disjoint) union of all E-classes.\n2As we shall see (Theorem 1(ii) below), any other element q p is likewise a generator\n\u2261\nof [p] because the E-classes generated by p and q coincide if q p (i.e., q [p]).\n\u2261 \u2208 34 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nProof. (i) By definition, x [p] iff x p. Now, if p A, reflexivity of E\n\u2208 \u2261 \u2208\nyields p p, whence p [p] A, as asserted.\n\u2261 \u2208 \u2286\n(ii) If p q, then, by symmetry and transitivity, ( x A) p x iff q x.\n\u2261 \u2200 \u2208 \u2261 \u2261\nThis means that x [p] iff x [q], i.e., [p] = [q]. Conversely, if [p] = [q], then\n\u2208 \u2208\npart (i) yields q [q] = [p], i.e., q [p], when p q, by the definition of [p].\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2261\n(iii) Suppose [p] [q] = , i.e., ( x) x [p] [q]. Then x [p] and x [q],\n\u2229 6 \u2205 \u2203 \u2208 \u2229 \u2208 \u2208\ni.e., x p q, whence, by (ii), [p] = [q]. Thus [p] and [q] cannot have a\n\u2261 \u2261\ncommon element unless [p] = [q].\n(iv) is a direct consequence of (i) and (iii). Thus all is proved. (cid:3)\nPart (iv) of this theorem shows that every equivalence relation E on A\ndefines a partition of A into E-classes. The converse is likewise true, as we\nshow next.\nTheorem 2. Every partition of a set A into disjoint sets A (i I) uniquely\ni\n\u2208\ndetermines an equivalence relation E on A, such that the sets A are exactly\ni\nthe E-classes in A.\nProof. Given A = A (disj.),3 define E as the set of all pairs (x,y) such\ni\nthat x and y belong to one and the same A . The relation E is easily shown\ni\nS\nto be reflexive, symmetric and transitive on A, with D = D\u2032 = A, so that E\nE E\nis an equivalence relation in A (we leave the details to the reader). Moreover,\nthe E-classes clearly coincide with the sets A . Thus E has all the required\ni\nproperties.\nNext, let E\u2032 be another equivalence relation on A, with the same properties,\nand take any p A. Then, by assumption, E[p] = A , where A is the partition\ni i\n\u2208\nset that contains p; also, E\u2032[p] = A for the same i. It follows that ( p)\ni\n\u2200\nE[p] = E\u2032[p], and this implies that E = E\u2032 (by the lemma of 6). Thus any\ntwo such E and E\u2032 must coincide, i.e., E is unique. (cid:3) \u00a7\nWe see that there is a close connection between all equivalence relations on\nAand allpartitions of A: Every equivalencerelation defines(or, as we shallsay,\ninduces) a partition, and vice versa. Note that the quotient set A/E is exactly\nthe family of the disjoint sets A whose union equals A, i.e., the family of the\ni\ndisjoint equivalence classes, under the equivalence relation E that corresponds\nto a given partition.\nNow we can give a more exact mathematical interpretation to the procedure\nof \u201cidentifying\u201d equivalent elements (see introductory remarks to this section).\nThis procedure applies whenever an equivalence relation E is consistent with\nsome operation or relation R, so that the substitution property holds with\nrespect to R. Then, as far as R is concerned, equivalent elements behave as\nif they were identical, so that they may be treated as \u201ccopies\u201d of one element.\n3We use this notation to indicate that A is the union of disjoint sets A (i I).\ni\n\u2208 \u2217 7. Equivalence Relations 35\n\u00a7\nWe achieve actual identity if we replace each element p of the set A by the\nequivalence class [p] generated by p. Indeed, then, all E-equivalent elements\nare replaced by one and the same equivalence class and thus become one thing.\nThus, from the mathematical point of view, the \u201cidentification\u201d of equivalent\nelements amounts to replacing the set A by the quotient set A/E. In what\nfollows,weshalloftenspeakof\u201cidentifying\u201dcertainobjects. Thereadershould,\nhowever, be aware of the fact that what is meant is actually the procedure\noutlined here, i.e., the replacement of A by the quotient set A/E.\nProblems on Equivalence Relations\n1.

Sequences\nOne of the basic notions of analysis is that of a sequence (infinite or finite).\nIt is closely connected with the theory of mappings and sets. Therefore we 38 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nconsider it here, even though it involves the notion of integers, to be formally\nintroduced in Chapter 2, along with real numbers.\nDefinition 1.\nBy an infinite sequence we mean a mapping (call it u) whose domain\nD consists of all positive integers 1, 2, 3, ... (it may also contain 0).\nu\nA finite sequence is a mapping u in which D consists of positive (or\nu\nnonnegative) integers less than some fixed integer p. The range D\u2032 may\nu\nconsist of arbitrary objects (numbers, points, lines, sets, books, etc.).\nNote 1. In a wider sense, one may speak of \u201csequences\u201d in which D also\nu\ncontains some negative integers, or excludes some positive integers. We shall\nnot need this more general notion.\nNote that a sequence, being a mapping, is a set of ordered pairs. For exam-\nple,\n1 2 3 ... n ...\nu = (1)\n2 4 6 ... 2n ...\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nis an infinite sequence, with D = 1, 2, 3, ... ; its range D\u2032 consists of the\nu { } u\nfunction\u2019s values\nu(1) = 2, u(2) = 4, u(3) = 6, ..., u(n) = 2n, n = 1, 2, ... .\nInstead of u(n), we usually write u (\u201cindex notation\u201d), and call u the n-th\nn n\nterm of the sequence. If n is treated as a variable, u is called the general term\nn\nof u, and u is used to denote the entire sequence, as well as its range D\u2032 .\n{ n } u\nThe formula u B means that D\u2032 is contained in a set B; we then call\n{ n } \u2286 u\nu a sequence of elements of B, or a sequence from B, or in B. To uniquely\ndetermine a sequence u, it suffices to define its general term (by some formula\nor rule) for every n D . In Example (1) above, u = 2n.\nu n\n\u2208\nSince the domain of a sequence is known to consist of integers, we often\nomit it and give only the range D\u2032 , specifying the terms u in the order of\nu n\ntheir indices n. Thus, instead of (1), we briefly write 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, ... or,\nmore generally, u , u , ..., u , ..., along with the still shorter notation u .\n1 2 n n\n{ }\nNevertheless, whatever the notation, the sequence u (a set of ordered pairs)\nshould not be confused with D\u2032 (the set of single terms u ).\nu n\nA sequence need not be a one-to-one mapping; it may have equal (\u201cre-\npeating\u201d) terms: u = u (m = n). For instance, in the infinite sequence\nm n\n6\n1, 1, ..., 1, ..., with general term u = 1, all terms are equal to 1, so that\nn\nits range D\u2032 has only one element, D\u2032 = 1 . Nevertheless, by Definition 1,\nu u { }\nthe sequence itself is infinite. This becomes apparent if we write it out in full\nnotation:\n1 2 3 ... n ...\nu = . (2)\n1 1 1 ... 1 ...\n(cid:18) (cid:19) 8. Sequences 39\n\u00a7\nIndeed, it is now clear that D contains all positive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., and u\nu\nitself contains infinitely many pairs (n,1), n = 1, 2, ..., even thoughD\u2032 = 1 .\nu { }\nSequencesin which all terms are equal are referred to as constant or stationary.\nIn sequences (1) and (2) we were able to define the general term by means\nof a formula: u = 2n or u = 1. This is not always possible. For example,\nn n\nnobody has yet succeeded in finding a formula expressing the general term of\nthe sequence\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, ... (3)\nof so-called prime numbers (i.e., integers with no positive divisors except 1 and\nthemselves).1 Nevertheless, this sequence is well defined since its terms can be\nobtained step by step: start with all positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ...; then remove\nfrom them all multiples of 2 except 2 itself; from the remaining set remove all\nmultiples of 3 except 3 itself, etc., ad infinitum. After the first step, we are left\nwith\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, ...;\nafter the second step, we obtain\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, ...,\nand so on, gradually obtaining (3).\nOther cases of such \u201cstep-by-step\u201d definitions (also called algorithmic or\ninductive definitions) will occur in the later work. In general, a sequence is\nregarded as well defined if some formula (or formulas) or rule has been given\nthat makes it possible to find all terms of the sequence, either directly or\nby some \u201cstep-by-step\u201d or other procedure. One should carefully avoid the\nmisconception that, if several terms in a sequence conform to some law or\nformula, then the same law applies to all the other terms. For instance, if only\nthe first three terms of (3) were given, it would be wrong to conclude that the\nsequence is necessarily 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., n, ..., with general term u = n. Thus\nn\nan infinite set can never be defined by giving a finite number of terms only;\nin this case one can only make a \u201cplausible\u201d guess as to the intended general\nterm. Moreover, one may well think of sequences in which the terms have been\nchosen \u201cat random,\u201d without any particular law. Such a \u201claw\u201d may, but need\nnot, exist.\nAs noted above, the terms of a sequence need not be numbers; they may\nbe arbitrary objects. In particular, we shall often consider sequences of sets:\nA , A , ..., A , ..., where each term A is a set (treated as one thing). The\n1 2 n n\nfollowing definitions will be useful in the later work.\n1For our purposes it is convenient to include 1 in this sequence, though usually 1 is not\nregarded as a prime number. 40 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nDefinition 2.\nA sequence of sets A , n = 1, 2, ..., is said to be expanding iff each\nn\n{ }\nterm A is a subset of the next term A , i.e.,\nn n+1\nA A , n = 1, 2, ...\nn n+1\n\u2286\n(except if A is the last term in a finite sequence).\nn\nThe sequence A is contracting iff\nn\n{ }\nA A , n = 1, 2, ...\nn n+1\n\u2287\n(with the same remark). In both cases, A is called a monotonic, or\nn\n{ }\nmonotone, set sequence.\nThis definition imitates a similar definition for number sequences:\nDefinition 3.\nA sequenceof real numbers u , n = 1, 2, ..., is said to be monotonic or\nn\n{ }\nmonotone iff it is either nondecreasing (i.e., u u ) or nonincreasing\nn n+1\n\u2264\n(i.e., u u ) for all terms. Notation: u and u .\nn n+1 n n\n\u2265 { }\u2191 { }\u2193\nIf the strict inequalities, u < n (u > u , respectively) hold,\nn n+1 n n+1\nthe sequence is said to be strictly monotonic (increasing or decreasing).\nNote 2. Sometimes we say \u201cstrictly increasing\u201d (or \u201cstrictly decreasing\u201d)\nin the latter case.\nFor example, the sequences (1) and (3) above are strictly increasing. Se-\nquence (2) (and any constant number sequence) is monotonic, but not strictly\nso; it is both nondecreasing and nonincreasing. Any sequence of concentric\ndiscs in a plane, with increasing radii, is an expanding sequence of sets (we\ntreat each disc as the set of all points inside its circumference). If the radii\ndecrease, we obtain a contracting sequence.\nBy a subsequence of a sequence u is meant (roughly speaking) any se-\nn\n{ }\nquenceobtainedbydroppingsometermsfrom u , without changing the order\nn\n{ }\nof the remaining terms, which then form the subsequence. More precisely, to\nobtain a subsequence, we must prescribethe terms that are supposedto remain\nin it. This is best done by indicating the subscripts of these terms. Note that\nall such subscripts necessarily form an increasing sequence of integers:\nn < n < n < < n < .\n1 2 3 k\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nIf these subscripts are given, they uniquely determine the corresponding terms\nof the subsequence:\nu , u , u , ...\nn1 n2 n3\nwith general term (or k-th term)\nu , k = 1, 2,... .\nnk 8. Sequences 41\n\u00a7\nThe subsequence is briefly denoted by u ; in special cases, also other nota-\nnk}\n{\ntions are used. Thus we have the following.\nDefinition 4.\nLet u be any sequence, and let n be a strictly increasing sequence\nn k\n{ } { }\nof integers from D . Then the sequence u , with k-th term equal to\nu nk}\n{\nu , is called the subsequence of u , determined by the sequence of\nnk n\n{ }\nsubscripts n D , k = 1, 2, 3, ... .\nk u\n{ } \u2286\nFor example, let us select from (3) the subsequence of terms with subscripts\n2, 4, 6, ..., 2k, ...\n(i.e., consisting of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ..., 2k-th, ... terms of (3)). We obtain\n2, 5, 11, 17, 23, 31, 41, ... .\nIf, instead, the terms\nu , u , u , ..., u , ...\n1 3 5 2k\u22121\nwere selected, we would obtain the subsequence\n1, 3, 7, 19, 29, 37, ... .\nThe first subsequence could briefly be denoted by u (here n = 2k); the\n2k k\n{ }\nsecond subsequence is u , n = 2k 1, k = 1, 2, ... .\n2k\u22121 k\n{ } \u2212\nObserve that, in every sequence u, the integers belonging to its domain\nD are used to \u201cnumber\u201d the terms of u, i.e., the elements of the range D\u2032 ;\nu u\ne.g., u is the first term, u the second, and so on. This procedure is actually\n1 2\nwell known from everyday life: by numbering the buildings in a street or the\nbooks in a library, we put them in a certain order or sequence. The question\nnow arises: given a set A, is it always possible to \u201cnumber\u201d its elements by\nintegers? More precisely, is there a sequence u , finite or infinite, such that\nn\n{ }\nA is contained in its range:\nA D\u2032 = u , u , ..., u , ... ?\n\u2286 u { 1 2 n }\nAsweshallseelater,thisquestionmust, ingeneral,beansweredinthenegative;\nthe set A may be so large that even all integers are too few to number its\nelements. At this stage we only formulate the following definition.\nDefinition 5.\nA set A is said to be countable iff A is contained in the range of some\nsequence (briefly: \u201cA can be put in a sequence\u201d).\nIf, in particular, this sequence can be chosen finite, we call A a finite set\n( is finite, since D\u2032 always). Thus all finite sets are countable.\n\u2205 \u2205 \u2286 u\nSets that are not finite are called infinite.\nSets that are not countable are called uncountable. 42 Chapter 1.

If a set A is countable or finite, so also is any subset B A,\n\u2286\nand so is the image f[A] of A under any mapping f. \u2217 9. Some Theorems on Countable Sets 45\n\u00a7\nProof. If A D\u2032 for a sequence u (finite or not), then certainly B A D\u2032 .\n\u2286 u \u2286 \u2286 u\nThus B can be put in the same sequence, proving our first assertion.\nNext, letf beanymap, andsupposefirstthatD A. Wemayassumethat\nf\n\u2287\nA fills a sequence (if not, drop some terms); say, A = u , u , ..., u , ... .\n1 2 n\n{ }\nThen f[A] consists exactly of the function values f(u ), f(u ), ..., f(u ), ... .\n1 2 n\nBut this very fact shows that f[A] can be put in a sequence v , with general\nn\n{ }\nterm v = f(u ). Thus f[A] is countable (finite if A is), as claimed. The case\nn n\nA * D is treated in Problem 1 below. Thus all is proved. (cid:3)\nf\nTheorem 2. If a set A is uncountable, so also is any set B A, and so is\n\u2287\nf[A] under any one-to-one map f, with D A. (Similarly for infinite sets.)\nf\n\u2287\nProof. The set B A cannot be countable or finite. Otherwise, its subset A\n\u2287\nwould have the same property, by Theorem 1, contrary to assumption.\nNext, if f is one-to-one, so is its inverse, f\u22121. If further A D , then\nf\n\u2286\nA = f\u22121[f[A]] by Problem 9 of 5. Now, if f[A] were countable or finite then,\n\u00a7\nby Theorem 1, so would be its image under any map, such as f\u22121. Thus the\nset f\u22121[f[A]] = A would be countable or finite, contrary to assumption. (cid:3)\nCorollary 1. If all terms of an infinite sequence u are distinct (different from\neach other), then its range is an infinite, though countable, set.\nProof. By assumption, u is a one-to-one map (its terms being distinct), with\nD = N = 1, 2, ... . Therangeofuistheu-imageofitsdomainN,i.e.,u[N].\nu\nNow, as N { is infinite} ,1 so also is u[N] by Theorem 2. (cid:3)\nTheorem 3. If the sets A and B are both countable, so is A B.\n\u00d7\nProof. If A or B is empty, then A B = , and all is proved.\n\u00d7 \u2205\nThus let A and B be nonempty. As before, we may assume that they fill\ntwo sequences, A = a and B = b . For convenience, we also assume that\nn m\n{ } { }\nthese sequences are infinite (if not, repeat some terms). Then, by definition,\nA B is the set of all ordered pairs of the form (a ,b ), where n and m take\nn m\n\u00d7\non independently the values 1, 2, ... . Call n+m the rank of the pair (a ,b ).\nn m\nThe only pair of rank 2 is (a ,b ). Of rank 3 are (a ,b ) and (a ,b ). More\n1 1 1 2 2 1\ngenerally,\n(a ,b ), (a ,b ), ..., (a ,b ) (1)\n1 r\u22121 2 r\u22122 r\u22121 1\nare the r 1 pairs of rank r.\n\u2212\nWe now put all pairs (a ,b ) in one sequence as follows. We start with\nn m\n(a ,b ); then take the two pairs of rank 3; then the three pairs of rank 4, and\n1 1\nso on. At the (r 1)-th step, we take all pairs of rank r in the order shown in\n\u2212\n(1). Continuing this process for all ranks ad infinitum, we obtain the sequence\nof pairs\n(a ,b ), (a ,b ), (a ,b ), (a ,b ), (a ,b ), ... .\n1 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 2\n1A proof of this fact will be suggested in Chapter 2, 6, Problem 15.\n\u00a7 46 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nBy construction, this sequence contains all pairs of any rank, hence all pairs\nthat form the set A B (for every such pair has some rank r; so it must occur\nin the sequence). Th\u00d7 us A B is put in a sequence. (cid:3)\n\u00d7\nAs an application, consider the set Q of all positive rationals, i.e., fractions\nn/m where n and m are naturals. Let n+m be called the rank of n/m, where\nn/m is written in lowest terms. By the same process (writing the fractions in\nthe order of their ranks), we put Q in an infinite sequence of distinct terms:\n1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 1/3, 3/1, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, ... .\nHence we obtain the following.\nCorollary 2. The set R of all rational numbers is countable.\nIndeed, we only have to insert the negative rationals and 0 in the above\nsequence, as follows:\n1 1 1 1\n0, 1, 1, , , 2, 2, , , 3, 3, ... .\n\u2212 2 \u22122 \u2212 3 \u22123 \u2212\nA similar \u201cranking\u201d method also yields the following result.\nTheorem 4. The union of any sequence of countable sets A is countable.\nn\n{ }\nProof. We must show that A = A can be put in one sequence. Now, as\nn n\neach A is countable, we may set\nn\nS\nA = a , a , ..., a , ... ,\nn n1 n2 nm\n{ }\nwhere the double subscripts are to distinguish the sequences representing dif-\nferent sets A . As before, we may assume that all sequences are infinite.\nn\nClearly A consists of the elements of all A combined, i.e., of all a\nn n nm\n(n, m N). Call n+m the rank of the term a . Proceed as in Theorem 3\nnm\n\u2208 S\nto obtain\nA = A = a , a , a , a , a , a , ... .\nn 11 12 21 13 22 31\n{ }\nThus A can be put i[n a sequence. (cid:3)\nNote 1. Theorem 4 is briefly stated as \u201cAny countable union of countable\nsets is countable\u201d (\u201ccountable union\u201d means \u201cunion of a countable family of\nsets,\u201d i.e., one that can be put in a finite or infinite sequence A ).\nn\n{ }\nNote 2. In particular, Theorem 4 applies to finite unions. Thus, if A and\nB are countable sets, so is A B. (So also are A B and A B since they are\n\u222a \u2229 \u2212\nsubsets of the countable set A; see Theorem 1.)\nIn the proof of Theorem 4, we see a set A whose elements a carried two\nnm\nsubscripts. To any pair (n,m) of such subscripts there corresponds a unique\nelement a of A. Thus we can define a function u (of two variables, n and\nnm\nm) by setting\nu(n,m) = a , n, m N.\nnm\n\u2208 \u2217 9. Some Theorems on Countable Sets 47\n\u00a7\nIts domain is the set N N of all pairs (m,n) of positive (or nonnegative)\n\u00d7\nintegers. Such a function is called an infinite double sequence, briefly denoted\nby u . Its range D\u2032 may consist of arbitrary objects, namely the function\n{ nm } u\nvalues u(n,m), briefly u .\nnm\nExactly as in Theorem 4, we obtain the following result.\nCorollary 3. The range of any double sequence u is a countable set.\nnm\n{ }\nTo show that uncountable sets exist also, we shall now prove the uncount-\nability of the interval [0,1), i.e., the set of all reals x such that 0 x < 1.\n\u2264\nWe assume as known that each real x [0,1) has a unique infinite decimal\n\u2208\nexpansion 0.x x ...x ..., where the x are the decimal digits, possibly zeros,\n1 2 n n\nand the sequence x does not terminate in nines (e.g., instead of 0.4999...,\nn\n{ }\nwe write 0.50000...). This fact is proved in Chapter 2, 13.\n\u00a7\nTheorem 5. The interval [0,1) of the real axis is uncountable.\nProof. We must show that no sequence can comprise all of [0,1).\nIndeed, takeany sequence u from[0,1). Writeeachtermu asaninfinite\nn n\n{ }\ndecimal fraction; say, u = 0.a a ...a ... . Then construct a new decimal\nn n1 n2 nm\nfraction z = 0.x x ...x ..., choosing the digits x as follows.\n1 2 n n\nIf a (i.e., the nth digit of u ) is 0, take x = 1; otherwise, take x = 0.\nnn n n n\nThus, in all cases, x = a , i.e., z differs from each u in at least one decimal\nn nn n\n6\ndigit (namely the nth digit). It follows that z differs from all u and hence is\nn\nnot in the sequence u , even though z [0,1). Thus, no matter what the\nn\n{ } \u2208\nchoice of u was, we found some z [0,1), not in the range of that sequence.\nn\nno{ u} [0,1).\u2208(cid:3)\nHence contains all of\nn\n{ }\nNote 3. Observe that the members a used in that proof form the \u201cdiag-\nnn\nonal\u201d of the indefinitely extending square consisting of all a :\nnn\na a a ...... a ...\n11 12 13 1n\na a a ...... a ...\n21 22 23 2n\na a a ...... a ...\n31 32 33 3n\n.................................\na a a ...... a ...\nn1 n2 n3 nn\n.................................\nTherefore the method used above is called the diagonal process (due to\nCantor).\nNow, by Corollary 2, all rationals can be put in a sequence. But, as shown\nabove, no such sequence can cover all of [0,1). Thus [0,1) must contain num-\nbers that are not rational, i.e., cannot be written as ratios of integers, n/m.\nMoreover, such numbers, called irrational, must form an uncountable set, for\notherwise its union with the countable set of all rationals in [0,1) would be\ncountable (by Note 2), whereas actually this union is the uncountable set [0,1). 48 Chapter 1. Some Set Theoretical Notions\nThe same argument applies to any other line interval with endpoints a and\nb (a < b), since any such interval is uncountable (see Problem 2). Thus we\nhave the following.\nCorollary 4. Between any two real numbers a and b (a < b) there are un-\ncountably many irrational numbers.\nNote 4. By Theorem 2, any superset of [0,1) is uncountable. In particular,\nso is the entire set of real numbers (the real axis).\nWe thus see that the irrationals form an uncountable set. In this sense, there\nare many more irrationals than rationals. Both sets are infinite. Thus there\nare different kinds of \u201cinfinities\u201d.\nProblems on Countable and Uncountable Sets\n1.

Infer that A is infinite (contradiction!).]  Chapter 2\nThe Real Number System\n\u00a71. Introduction\nHistorically, the real number system is the result of a long gradual develop-\nment that started with positive integers (\u201cnatural numbers\u201d) 1, 2, 3, ..., later\nfollowed by the invention of the rational numbers (i.e., fractions p/q where p\nand q are integers); it was completed by the discovery of irrational numbers.\nItispossibletoreproducethisgradualdevelopmentalsoinexacttheory, that\nis, to build up the real number system step by step from natural numbers. At\nthis stage, however, we shallassumethe setofallrealnumbersasalreadygiven,\nwithout attempting to reduce the notion of real number to simpler concepts.\nAlso without definition (i.e., as so-called primitive concepts) shall we introduce\nthe notions of the sum (a + b) and the product, (a b) or (ab), of two real\n\u00b7\nnumbers a and b, as well as the inequality relation < (read: \u201cless than\u201d). The\nset of all real numbers taken together will be denoted by E1 (read: \u201cE one\u201d).\nThe formula \u201cx E1\u201d means that x is in E1, i.e., x is a real number.\n\u2208\nThus our primitive concepts are E1 (set of all reals), + (plus sign), (mul-\n\u00b7\ntiplication sign), and < (inequality sign).\nRemark. Every mathematical theory must start with certain concepts ac-\ncepted as primitive (i.e., without definition), since it is impossible to define\nall terms used. Indeed, any definition can only explain some terms by means\nof others. If the latter, too, were to be defined, new defining terms would be\nneeded, and this process would never end. It is often only a matter of con-\nvention, which notions to accept as the first (i.e., the primitive) ones. Once,\nhowever, the choice has been made, all other notions should be defined in terms\nof the primitive ones. Similarly, it is impossible to prove all statements of a\ndeductive theory. Certain propositions (called axioms) must be accepted as\nthe first ones, without proof. Once, however, the axioms have been stated, all\nthe following propositions (called theorems) must be proved, i.e., deduced in a\nstrictly logical way from the axioms. This procedure characterizes every exact\ndeductive science. 52 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nWe now proceed to state a system of axioms for real numbers. The first\nnine axioms will be given in 2 (for a reason to be explained later, they will be\n\u00a7\ncalled \u201caxioms of an ordered field\u201d). The last (10th) axiom will be formulated\nin a later section.\n\u00a72. Axioms of an Ordered Field\nWe shall assume as axioms (i.e., without proof) the following simple properties\nof real numbers. (The reader is certainly familiar with these properties from\nschool algebra, where they are often regarded as \u201cobvious\u201d, so that it might\nseem superfluous to mention them. We must, however, state them as axioms\nin accordance with our introductory remarks made in 1. Each axiom has a\n\u00a7\nname given in parenthesis.)\nA. Axioms of addition and multiplication.\nI (Closure law) The sum x+y and the product xy of any two real numbers\nx and y are themselves real numbers. In symbols:\n( x,y E1) (x+y) E1, (xy) E1.\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2208 \u2208\nII (Commutative laws) ( x,y E1) x+y = y +x, xy = yx.\n\u2200 \u2208\nIII (Associative laws) ( x,y,z E1) (x+y)+z = x+(y+z), (xy)z = x(yz).\n\u2200 \u2208\nIV (Existence of neutral elements)\n(a) There exists a (unique) real number, called \u201czero\u201d (0), such that,\nfor all real x, x+0 = x.\n(b) There exists a (unique) real number, called \u201cone\u201d (1), such that\n1 = 0 and, for all real x, x 1 = x. In symbols:\n6 \u00b7\n( !0 E1) ( x E1) x+0 = x,\n\u2203 \u2208 \u2200 \u2208\n( !1 E1) ( x E1) x 1 = x, 1 = 0.\n\u2203 \u2208 \u2200 \u2208 \u00b7 6\nThe numbers 0 and 1 are called the neutral elements of addition and\nmultiplication, respectively.\nV (Existence of inverses)\n(a) For every real number x, there is a (unique) real number, denoted\nx, such that x+( x) = 0.\n\u2212 \u2212\n(b) For every real number x, other than 0, there is a (unique) real num-\nber denoted x\u22121, such that x x\u22121 = 1. In symbols:\n\u00b7\n( x E1) ( ! x E1) x+( x) = 0,\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2203 \u2212 \u2208 \u2212\n( x E1 x = 0) ( !x\u22121 E1) x x\u22121 = 1.\n\u2200 \u2208 | 6 \u2203 \u2208 \u00b7 2. Axioms of an Ordered Field 53\n\u00a7\nThe numbers x and x\u22121 are called, respectively, the additive inverse (or\n\u2212\nthe symmetric) and the multiplicative inverse (or the reciprocal) of x.\nVI (Distributive law) ( x,y,z E1) (x+y)z = xz +yz.\n\u2200 \u2208\nNote. The uniqueness assertions in Axioms IV and V could actually be\nomitted since they can be proved from other axioms.\nB. Axioms of order.\nVII (Trichotomy) For any real numbers x and y, we have either x < y or\ny < x or x = y, but never two of these relations together.\nVIII (Transitivity) If x, y, z are real numbers, with x < y and y < z, then\nx < z. In symbols:\n( x,y,z E1) x < y < z implies x < z.\n\u2200 \u2208\nIX (Monotonicity of addition and multiplication)\n(a) ( x,y,z E1) x < y implies x+z < y +z.\n\u2200 \u2208\n(b) ( x,y,z E1) x < y and 0 < z implies xz < yz.\n\u2200 \u2208\nNote 1. As has already been mentioned, one additional (10th) axiom will\nbe stated later.\nNote 2. While every real number has an additive inverse (Axiom V(a)),\nonly nonzero numbers have reciprocals. The number 0 has no reciprocal. (Ax-\niom V(b).)\nNote 3. Note the restriction 0 < z in Axiom IX(b). It is easy to see that\nwithout this restriction the axiom would be false. For example, we have 2 < 3,\nbut 2( 1) is not less than 3( 1). No such restriction occurs in Axiom IX(a).\n\u2212 \u2212\nDue to the introduction of inequalities \u201c<\u201d and the Axioms VII\u2013IX, the\nreal numbers may be regarded as given in some definite order, under which\nsmaller numbers precede the larger ones. (This is why Axioms VII\u2013IX are\ncalled \u201caxioms of order\u201d.) We express this fact briefly by saying that E1 is an\nordered set. More precisely, an ordered set is a set in which a certain relation\n\u201c<\u201d has been defined in such a manner that the trichotomy and transitivity\nlaws are satisfied.\nThe ordering of real numbers can be visualized by \u201cplotting\u201d them as points\non a directed line (\u201cthe real axis\u201d), as shown below in Figure 8:\n2 11 1 1 0 1 1 2\n\u2212 \u2212 2 \u2212 \u22122 2\nFigure 8 54 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nTherefore, real numbers are also often referred to as \u201cpoints\u201d of the real\naxis. We say, e.g.,\u201cthe pointx\u201dinsteadof \u201cthe numberx.\u201d We assumethatthe\nreader is familiar with this process of geometric representation of real numbers.\nWe shall not dwell on its justification since it will only be used as illustration,\nnot as proof.\nIt should be noted that the axioms only specify certain properties of real\nnumbers without indicating what these numbers actually are. This question is\nleftentirelyopen, sothatwemayregardrealnumbersasjustany mathematical\nobjects that are only supposed to satisfy our axioms but otherwise are entirely\narbitrary. This makes our theory more general. Indeed, our theory also applies\nto any other set of objects (numbers or not numbers), provided only that they\nsatisfy our axioms with respect to a certain relation of order (<) and certain\noperations(+)and( ), whichmay, butneednot,coincidewithordinarynumber\n\u00b7\naddition and multiplication. Whatever follows logically from the axioms must\nbe true not only for real numbers but also for any other set that conforms with\nthese axioms. In this connection, we introduce the following definitions.\nDefinition 1.\nA field F is any set of objects with two operations (+) and ( ) (usually\n\u00b7\ncalled \u201caddition\u201d and \u201cmultiplication\u201d) defined in it, provided that these\nobjects and operations satisfy the first six axioms (I\u2013VI) listed above.\nIf this set is also equipped with an order relation (<) satisfying the\nadditional three axioms VII\u2013IX, it is called an ordered field.\nIn particular, the real number system E1 is an ordered field. Of course,\nwhen speaking of ordered fields in general, the term \u201creal number\u201d in the\naxioms should be replaced by \u201celement of F.\u201d Similarly, 0 and 1 should\nbe interpreted as elements of the field satisfying Axiom IV(a) and (b),\nbut not necessarily as ordinary numbers.\nE1 is not the only ordered field known in mathematics. Indeed, many ex-\namples of ordered and unordered fields are studied in higher algebra. We shall\nencounter some of them later.\nAs has been mentioned, everything that can be deduced from Axioms I\u2013\nIX applies not only to E1 but also to any other ordered field F (since F is\nsupposedto satisfy theseaxioms). Therefore, we shallhenceforthformulate our\ndefinitions and theorems in a more general way, speaking of \u201cordered fields\u201d in\ngeneral instead of E1 alone. Of course, whatever we say about ordered fields\napplies in particular to E1, and this particular example should be always kept\nin mind.\nDefinition 2.\nAn element x of an ordered field F is said to be positive or negative\naccording as x > 0 or x < 0. The element 0 itself is neither positive nor\nnegative. 2. Axioms of an Ordered Field 55\n\u00a7\nHere and henceforth \u201cx > y\u201d means the same as \u201cy < x\u201d. We also write\n\u201cx y\u201d for \u201cx < y or x = y\u201d; similarly for x y.\n\u2264 \u2265\nThe numbers 0 and 1 have been introduced in Axiom IV, but we do not\nyet \u201cofficially\u201d know what such symbols as 2, 3, 4, ..., etc. mean, since they\nhave not yet been defined. Indeed, we have only introduced the notion of real\nnumber, but not that of natural number (or integer). Therefore, in our system,\nthe latter must be defined in terms of our primitive concepts. Since, however,\naddition is already known, we can use it to define positive integers step by step,\nas follows:\n2 = 1+1, 3 = 2+1, 4 = 3+1, 5 = 4+1, etc.\nIf this process is continued indefinitely, we obtain what is called the set of all\n\u201cpositive integers\u201d (or \u201cnatural numbers\u201d). We may say that a natural number\nis one that can be obtained from 0 by adding to it 1 a finite number of times.\nA similar process is, of course, possible not only in E1 but in any field. Thus\nwe may speak of \u201cnatural elements\u201d in any field.\nThis may serve as a preliminary definition of natural numbers. A more exact\ndefinition will be given in 5.\n\u00a7\nDefinition 3.\nGiven several elements a, b, c, d of a field F, we define\na+b+c = (a+b)+c, a+b+c+d = (a+b+c)+d, etc.\nSimilarly for multiplication.\n\u00a73. Arithmetic Operations in a Field\nAll arithmetic properties of real numbers can be deduced from the axioms\nstated in 2. We shall dwell on only some of these properties to illustrate the\n\u00a7\nmethod of proving them. In this section we shall investigate inferences of the\nfirst six axioms, which hold in every (even unordered) field F.\nDefinition 1.\nGiven two elements x and y of a field F, we define their difference,\nx y = x+( y).\n\u2212 \u2212\nInotherwords, to subtract an element y means to add its additive inverse,\ny.\n\u2212\nIf y = 0, we also define the quotient of x by y,\n6\nx\n= x (y\u22121),\ny \u00b7 56 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nalso denoted by x/y. In other words, to divide x by y means to multiply\nx by the reciprocal of y (provided that y\u22121 exists, i.e., that y = 0).\n6\nIn this way we have defined two new operations: subtraction (i.e., formation\nof differences) and division (i.e., formation of quotients). Note: Division by\n0 is undefined, hence inadmissible. Since subtraction and division have been\ndefined as special cases of addition and multiplication, respectively, we can\napply to them our axioms to obtain the following corollaries.\nCorollary 1. The difference x y and the quotient x/y (where y = 0) of two\n\u2212 6\nreal numbers x and y are themselves real numbers. (Similarly for differences\nand quotients of field elements in general.)\nIn symbols:\n( x,y E1) (x y) E1, (x/y) E1 (the latter if y = 0).\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2212 \u2208 \u2208 6\nCorollary 2. If a, b, c are elements of a field F, with a = b, then\na+c = b+c and ac = bc.\n(In other words, we may add one and the same element c to both sides of an\nequation a = b; similarly for multiplication.)\nIn symbols:\n( a,b,c F) a = b implies a+c = b+c and ac = bc.\n\u2200 \u2208\nProof. By properties of equality, we obviously have a+c = a+c (since the\nleft side is the same as the right side). Now, as a = b, we may replace a by b on\nthe right side. This yields a+c = b+c, as required. Similarly for ac = bc. (cid:3)\nThe converse to this corollary is the following.\nCorollary 3 (Cancellation law). If a, b, c are elements of a field F, then\na+c = b+c implies a = b.\nIf, further, c = 0, then\n6\nac = bc implies a = b.\n(In other words, we may cancel a summand and a nonzero factor on both sides\nof an equation.)\nProof. Let a+c = b+c. By Corollary 2, we may add ( c) on both sides of\n\u2212\nthis equation to get\n(a+c)+( c) = (b+c)+( c),\n\u2212 \u2212\nor, by associativity (Axiom III),\na+[c+( c)] = b+[c+( c)].\n\u2212 \u2212 3. Arithmetic Operations in a Field 57\n\u00a7\nAs c + ( c) = 0 (by Axiom V), we obtain a + 0 = b + 0, i.e., a = b (by\nAxiom IV\u2212 ); similarly for multiplication. (cid:3)\nTheorem 1. Given two elements, a and b, of a field F, there always exists a\nunique element x such that a+x = b; this element equals the difference b a.\n\u2212\n(Thus a+x = b means that x = b a.)\n\u2212\nIf, further, a = 0, there also is a unique element y F, with ay = b; this\n6 \u2208\nelement equals the quotient b/a. (Thus ay = b, a = 0, means that y = b/a.)\n6\nIn symbols:\n( a,b F) ( !x,y F) a+x = b, ay = b (the latter if a = 0).\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2203 \u2208 6\nWe prove only the first part of the theorem, leaving the second (which is\nproved in the same way) to the reader.\nIt is easily checked that the equation a+x = b is satisfied by x = b a. In\n\u2212\nfact, we have (using commutativity, associativity, and Axioms IV and V)\na+x = a+(b a) = (b a)+a = [b+( a)]+a = b+[( a)+a] = b+0 = b.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nThus the equation a + x = b has at least one solution for x, namely x =\nb a. To prove that this solution is unique, suppose that we have still another\n\u2212\nsolution, x\u2032, say. Then we obtain a+x = b and a+x\u2032 = b, so that a+x = a+x\u2032,\nor x+a = x\u2032 +a. Cancelling a (by Corollary 3), we see that x = x\u2032, so that\nthe two solutions necessarily coincide.\nThus both the existence and uniqueness of the solution have been proved.\nTheorem 1 shows that subtraction and division are inverse operations with\nrespect to addition and multiplication. It can also be interpreted as a rule for\ntransferring a summand or a factor from one side of an equation to the other.\nCorollary 4. For any element x of a field F, we have 0 x = x. If, further,\n\u2212 \u2212\nx = 0, then 1/x = x\u22121.\n6\nIn fact, we have, by definition,\n0 x = 0+( x) = x (Axiom IV).\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nSimilarly,\n1/x = 1 x\u22121 = x\u22121.\n\u00b7\nCorollary 5. For any element x of a field F, we have\nx 0 = 0 x = 0.\n\u00b7 \u00b7\n(Hence we never have 0 x = 1; this is why 0 cannot have a multiplicative\n\u00b7\ninverse.)\nIn fact, by distributivity (Axiom VI) and by Axiom IV, we get\n0x+0x = (0+0)x = 0x = 0+0x. 58 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nThus 0x+0x = 0+0x. Cancelling 0x on both sides (Corollary 3), we obtain\n0 x = 0, and by commutativity, also x 0 = 0.\n\u00b7 \u00b7\nCorollary 6 (Rule of signs). For any elements a, b of a field F, we have\n(i) a( b) = ( a)b = (a b);\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u00b7\n(ii) ( a) = a;\n\u2212 \u2212\n(iii) ( a)( b) = ab.\n\u2212 \u2212\nProof. Formula (i) means that a( b), and similarly ( a)b, equals the additive\n\u2212 \u2212\ninverse of ab. Therefore, to prove its first part, we have to show that a( b)+\n\u2212\nab = 0 (for, this is the definition of the additive inverse). But, by distributivity,\nwe have\na( b)+ab = a[( b)+b] = a 0 = 0\n\u2212 \u2212 \u00b7\n(by Corollary 5), as required.\nSimilarly we show that ( a)b = (ab) and that ( a) = a.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nFinally, (iii) is obtained from (i) when a is replaced by ( a). Thus all is\nproved. (cid:3) \u2212\n\u00a74. Inequalities in an Ordered Field. Absolute Values\nAs further examples of applications of our axioms, we now proceed to deduce\nsome corollaries to Axioms VI\u2013IX. They apply to any ordered field.\nCorollary 1. If x is a positive element of an ordered field F, then x is\n\u2212\nnegative; and if x is negative, then x is positive.\n\u2212\nProof. Given x > 0, we may add ( x) on both sides, by Axiom IX. Then we\n\u2212\nobtain\nx+( x) > 0+( x), i.e., 0 > x,\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nas required. Similarly, it is shown that x < 0 implies x > 0. (cid:3)\n\u2212\nCorollary 2 (Addition and multiplication of inequalities). If a, b, x, y are\nelements of an ordered field F, such that a < b and x < y, then\na+x < b+y\n(i.e., we may always add two inequalities).\nIf, further, a, b, x, y are positive, then a < b and x < y implies ax < by\n(i.e., the inequalities may be multiplied).\nProof. Both parts of the corollary are proved in a similar way, so we prove\nonly the second part. 4. Inequalities in an Ordered Field. Absolute Values 59\n\u00a7\nSuppose that a < b, and x < y, with a, b, x, y positive. Then, multiplying\nthe first inequality by x and the second by b (Axiom IX(b)), we have\nax < bx and bx < by.\nHence, by transitivity, ax < bx < by, i.e., ax < by, as required. (cid:3)\nNote 1. Multiplication of inequalities may fail if the numbers involved are\nnot positive. For example, we have 2 < 3 and 2 < 1, but multiplication\n\u2212 \u2212\nwould lead to a false result: 4 < 3. (However, it suffices that only b and x in\nCorollary 2 be positive.)\nCorollary 3. All nonzero elements of an ordered field have positive squares.\nThat is, if a = 0, then a2 = a a > 0. (Hence 1 = 12 > 0.)\n6 \u00b7\nProof. As a = 0, we have, by trichotomy, either a > 0 or a < 0.\n6\nIf a > 0, then we may multiply by a, obtaining a a > 0 a = 0, i.e., a2 > 0.\n\u00b7 \u00b7\nIf a < 0, then, by Corollary 1, a > 0; so we may multiply the inequality\n\u2212\na < 0 by ( a), using again Axiom IX(b). We then obtain\n\u2212\na( a) < 0 ( a) = 0, i.e., a2 < 0, whence a2 > 0, as required. (cid:3)\n\u2212 \u00b7 \u2212 \u2212\nDefinition.\nGiven an element x of an ordered field F, we define its absolute value,\ndenoted x , as follows:\n| |\nIf x 0, then x = x; if, however, x < 0, then x = x.\n\u2265 | | | | \u2212\nIn particular, 0 = 0. It follows that x is always nonnegative. In fact, if\n| | | |\nx 0, then x = x 0; and if x < 0, then by Corollary 1, x > 0; and here\n\u2265 | | \u2265 \u2212\nx = x > 0. Moreover, we always have\n\u2212 | |\nx x x . (1)\n\u2212| | \u2264 \u2264 | |\nFor, if x 0, then x = x by definition, and x = x 0 x. If, however,\n\u2265 | | \u2212| | \u2212 \u2264 \u2264\nx < 0, then x > x since x is positive, while x is negative and x = x . Thus\n| | | | \u2212| |\n(1) holds in both cases.\nCorollary 4. For any elements x and y of an ordered field F, we have x < y\n| |\niff y < x < y.\n\u2212\nProof. Suppose first that x < y. Then, by formula (1), we have x x < y,\n| | \u2264 | |\nwhence x < y. It remains to prove that y < x. This is certainly true if x\n\u2212\nis nonnegative (for y is negative here). If, however, x is negative, then by\n\u2212\ndefinition, x = x , whence x < y (for x < y, by assumption); that is,\n\u2212 | | \u2212 | |\ny < x. Thus, in all cases, x < y implies y < x < y.\n\u2212 | | \u2212\nThe converse is proved in a similar way, by distinguishing the two cases:\nx 0 and x < 0. The details are left to the reader. (cid:3)\n\u2265 60 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nNote 2. This corollary has a simple geometric interpretation. Namely, if x\nis plotted on the real axis, then x is its (undirected) distance from the origin\n| |\n0. Thus the formulas x < y and y < x < y express both the fact that this\n| | \u2212\ndistance is < y.\nCorollary 5. For any elements a and b of an ordered field F, we have\nab = a b .\n| | | |\u00b7| |\nIf further b = 0, then\n6\na a\n| | = .\nb b\n| | (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\nFor the proof, consider the four possi(cid:12)ble(cid:12)cases:\n(1) a 0, b 0; (2) a 0, b < 0; (3) a < 0, b 0; and (4) a < 0, b < 0.\n\u2265 \u2265 \u2265 \u2265\nThe result then easily follows by the definition of absolute value.\nCorollary 6.

Given any two elements a and b (a < b) of an ordered field F,\nthere always is an element x F such that a < x < b. (This element is said to\n\u2208\nlie between a and b.)\nThis important proposition is often expressed by saying that every ordered\nfield (in particular, E1) is densely ordered. More generally, an ordered set F 4. Inequalities in an Ordered Field. Absolute Values 61\n\u00a7\nis said to be densely ordered if it has the property expressed in Corollary 7. In\nthis connection, Corollary 7 will be referred to as the density property of real\nnumbers, or the density of an ordered field.\nProof. It suffices to take\n1\nx = (a+b).\n2\nThen Axiom II easily yields a < x < b. The details are left to the reader. (cid:3)\nNote 3. Corollary 7 shows that, given a real number a, there never exists\na number \u201cclosest\u201d or \u201cnext\u201d to a. In fact, if b were such a number, then by\nCorollary 7, one could find a number x (a < x < b) still closer to a.\nNote 4. Having found one number, say x , between a and b, we can again\n1\napplyCorollary7tofindanumberx betweenx andb,thenagainanumberx\n2 1 3\nbetween x and b, and so on. Since this process can be continued indefinitely,\n2\nCorollary 7 may be strengthened to say that there are infinitely many real\nnumbers between any two given numbers a and b; similarly for ordered fields\nin general.\nAs previously noted, the propositions proved in 3 and 4 are only examples\n\u00a7\u00a7\nillustratingthedeductionofarithmeticrulesfromaxioms.

Natural Numbers. Induction\nAt the end of 2, we showed how to select from E1 the natural numbers\n\u00a7\n1, 2, 3,..., starting with 1 and then adding 1 to each preceding number to\nget the following one. This process also applies to any other field F; the ele-\nments so selected are called the natural elements of F, and the set of all such\nelements (obtained by continuing the process indefinitely) is denoted by N.\nNote that, by this construction, we always have n+1 N if n N.\n\u2208 \u2208\n\u2217A more precise approach to natural elements is as follows.1 A subset S of\na field F is called inductive iff\n(i) 1 S (S contains the unity element of F) and\n\u2208\n(ii) ( x S) x+1 S (S contains x+1 whenever x is in S).2\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2208\nDefine N to be the intersection of all such subsets. We then obtain the follow-\ning.\n\u2217\nTheorem 1. The set N so defined is inductive itself. In fact, it is the\n\u201csmallest\u201d inductive set in F (i.e., contained in any other such set).\nProof. We have to show that, with our new definition,\n(i) 1 N and\n\u2208\n1The beginner may omit all \u201cstarred\u201d passages and simply assume Theorems 1\u2032 and 2\u2032\nbelow as additional axioms without proof.\n2Suchsubsetsdoexist;e.g.,theentirefieldF isinductivesince1 F and( x F)x+1\n\u2208 \u2200 \u2208 \u2208\nF, by the closure law. 64 Chapter 2.

Thus 1 N, as claimed.\n\u2208\nNext, take any x N. Then, by our new definition of N, x is in every\n\u2208\ninductive set S. Hence, by property (ii) of such sets, also x+1 is in every such\nS; thus x+1 is in the intersection of all inductive sets, i.e., x+1 N, and so\n\u2208\nN is inductive, indeed.\nFinally, by definition, N is the common part of all such sets, hence contained\nin each. (cid:3)\nFor applications, Theorem 1 is usually expressed as follows.\nTheorem 1\u2032 (First induction law). A proposition P(n) involving a natural n\nholds for all n N in a field F if\n\u2208\n(i) it holds for n = 1 [P(1) is true]; and\n(ii) whenever P(n) holds for n = m, it holds for n = m + 1; [P(m) =\n\u21d2\nP(m+1)].\n\u2217\nProof. Let S be the set of all those n N for which P(n) is true; that\n\u2208\nis, S = n N P(n) . We must show that actually each n N is in S,\n{ \u2208 | } \u2208\ni.e., N S.\n\u2286\nFirst, we show that S is inductive. By our assumption (i), P(1) is true, so\n1 S.\n\u2208\nNext, suppose x S. This means that P(x) is true. But by assumption (ii),\n\u2208\nthis implies P(x+1), i.e., x+1 S. Thus ( x S) x+1 S and 1 S; so\nS is inductive. But then, by The\u2208 orem 1 (seco\u2200 nd\u2208 clause), N \u2208 S. (cid:3) \u2208\n\u2286\nThis theorem is widely used to prove general propositions on natural ele-\nments, as follows. In order to show that some formula or proposition P(n) is\ntrue for every natural n, we first verify P(1), i.e., show that P(n) holds for\nn = 1. We then show that\n( m N) P(m) = P(m+1);\n\u2200 \u2208 \u21d2\nthat is, if P(n) holds for some value n = m, then it also holds for n = m+1.\nOnce these two facts are established, Theorem 1\u2032 ensures that P(n) holds for\nall natural n.\nProofs of this kind are called inductive, or proofs by induction. Note that\nevery such proof consists of two steps:\n(i) P(1) and (ii) P(m) = P(m+1).\n\u21d2\nSpecial caution must be applied in step (ii). Here we temporarily assume\nthat P(n) has already been verified for some particular (but unspecified) value 5. Natural Numbers. Induction 65\n\u00a7\nn = m.3 From this assumption, we then try to deduce that P(n) holds for\nn = m+1 as well. This fact must be proved; it would be a bad error to simply\nsubstitute m+1 for m in the assumed formula P(m) since it was assumed for\na particular value m, not for m + 1. The following examples illustrate this\nprocedure.4\nExamples.\n(A) If m and n are natural elements, so are m + n and mn. To prove it,\nfix any m N. Let P(n) mean that m + n N. We now verify the\n\u2208 \u2208\nfollowing:\n(i) P(1) is true; for m N is given. Hence, by the very definition of\n\u2208\nN, m+1 N. But this means exactly that P(n) holds for n = 1,\n\u2208\ni.e., P(1) is true.\n(ii) P(k) = P(k+1) (here we use a different letter, k, since m is fixed\n\u21d2\nalready). Suppose that P(n) holds for some particular n = k. This\nmeans that m+k N. Hence, by the definition of N, (m+k)+1\n\u2208 \u2208\nN; or, by associativity, m + (k + 1) N. But this means exactly\n\u2208\nthat P(k+1) is true (if P(k) is). Thus, indeed, P(k) = P(k+1).\n\u21d2\nSince (i) and (ii) have been established, induction is complete;\nthat is, Theorem 1\u2032 shows that P(n) holds for each n N, and this\n\u2208\nmeans that m+n N. As m and n are arbitrary naturals, our first\n\u2208\nassertion is proved.5\nTo show that mn N also, we now let P(n) mean that mn N\n\u2208 \u2208\n(for a fixed m N) and proceed similarly. We leave this to the\n\u2208\nreader.\n(B) If n N, then n 1 = 0 or n 1 N. Indeed, let P(n) mean that\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nn 1 = 0 or n 1 N (one of the two is required). We again verify the\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2208\ntwo steps:\n(i) P(1) is true; for if n = 1, then n 1 = 1 1 = 0. Thus one of the\n\u2212 \u2212\ntwo desired alternatives, namely n 1 = 0, holds if n = 1. Hence\n\u2212\nP(1) is true.\n(ii) P(m) = P(m+1). Suppose P(n) holds for some particular value\n\u21d2\nn = m (inductive hypothesis). This means that either m 1 = 0 or\n\u2212\nm 1 N.\n\u2212 \u2208\nIn the first case, we have (m 1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 N. But\n\u2212 \u2208\n(m 1)+1 = (m+1) 1byassociativityandcommutativity(verify!).\n\u2212 \u2212\nThus (m+1) 1 N.\n\u2212 \u2208\n3This temporary assumption is called the inductive hypothesis.\n4Actually, these examples are basic theorems on naturals, to be well noted.\n5Note the technique we applied here. Faced with two variables m and n, we fixed m and\ncarried out the induction on n. This is a common procedure. 66 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nIn the second case, m 1 N implies (m 1)+1 N by the\n\u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2208\nvery definition of N. Thus, in both cases, (m+1) 1 N, and this\n\u2212 \u2208\nshows that P(m+1) is true if P(m) is.\nAs (i) and (ii) have been established, induction is complete.\n(C) In an ordered field, all naturals are 1. Indeed, let P(n) now mean that\n\u2265\nn 1. As before, we again carry out the two inductive steps.\n\u2265\n(i) P(1) holds; for if n = 1, then certainly n 1; so P(n) holds for\n\u2265\nn = 1.\n(ii) P(m) = P(m+1). We make the inductive hypothesis that P(m)\n\u21d2\nholds for some particular m. This means that m 1. Hence, by\n\u2265\nmonotonicity of addition and transitivity (Axioms II and VIII), we\nhave m + 1 1 + 1 > 1 (the latter follows by adding 1 on both\n\u2265\nsides of 1 > 0). Thus m+1 > 1 and certainly m+1 1, that is,\n\u2265\nP(m+1) holds (if P(m) does). Induction is complete.\n(D) In an ordered field, m, n N and m > n implies m n N. Indeed,\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2208\nfixing an arbitrary m N, let P(n) mean \u201cm n 0 or m n N.\u201d\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2264 \u2212 \u2208\nThen we have the following:\n(i) P(1) is true; for if n = 1, then m n = m 1. But, by Example (B),\n\u2212 \u2212\nm 1 = 0 or m 1 N. This shows that P(n) holds for n = 1;\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nP(1) is true.\n(ii) P(k) = P(k+1). Suppose P(k) holds for some particular k N.\n\u21d2 \u2208\nThis means that\nm k 0 or m k N.\n\u2212 \u2264 \u2212 \u2208\nBy Example (B), it easily follows that either\n(m k) 1 0 or (m k) 1 N;\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nthat is,\neither m (k +1) 0 or m (k +1) N.\n\u2212 \u2264 \u2212 \u2208\nBut this shows that P(k + 1) holds (if P(k) does). By induction,\nthen, P(n) holds for every n N; that is,\n\u2208\neither m n 0 or m n N for every n N.\n\u2212 \u2264 \u2212 \u2208 \u2208\nLemma. For no naturals m, n in an ordered field is m < n < m+1.\nFor, by Example (D), n > m would imply n m N, hence n m 1 (by\n\u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2265\nExample (C)). But n m 1, or n m+1, excludes n < m+1 (trichotomy).\n\u2212 \u2265 \u2265\nThus m < n < m+1 is impossible for naturals. 5. Natural Numbers. Induction 67\n\u00a7\nTheorem 2. In an ordered field, every nonempty subset of N (the naturals)\nhas a least element, i.e., one not exceeding any other of its members.6\n\u2217\nProof. Given = A N, we want to show that A has a least element. To\n\u2205 6 \u2286\ndo this, let\nA = x A x n n = 1, 2 ... .\nn\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 }\nThat is, A consists of those elements of A that are n (A may be empty).\nn n\n\u2264\nNow let P(n) mean\n\u201ceither A = or A has a least element.\u201d (1)\nn n\n\u2205\nWe show by induction that P(n) holds for each n N. Indeed, we have the\n\u2208\nfollowing:\n(i) P(1) is true; for, by construction, A consists of all naturals from A that\n1\nare 1 (if any). But, by Example (C), the only such natural is 1. Thus A , if\n1\n\u2264\nnot empty, consists of 1 alone, and so 1 is also its least member. We see that\neither A = or A has a least element; i.e., P(1) is true.\n1 1\n\u2205\n(ii) P(m) = P(m+1). Suppose P(m) holds for some particular m. This\n\u21d2\nmeans that A = or A has a least element (call it m ). In the latter case,\nm m 0\n\u2205\nm is also the least member of A ; for, by the lemma, A differs from\n0 m+1 m+1\nA by the element m+1 at most, which is greater than all members of A .\nm m\nIf, however, A = , then for the same reason, A (if = ) consists of\nm m+1\n\u2205 6 \u2205\nm+1 alone; so m+1 is also its least element.\nThis shows that P(m+1) is true (if P(m) is). Thus the inductive proof is\ncomplete, and (1) holds for every A .\nn\nNow, by assumption, A = ; so we fix some n A. Then the set\n6 \u2205 \u2208\nA = x A x n\nn\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 }\ncontains n, and hence A = . Thus by (1), A must have a least element m ,\nn n 0\n6 \u2205\nm n. But A differs from A only by elements > n (if any), which are all\n0 n\n> m\u2264 . Thus m is the desired least element of A as well. (cid:3)\n0 0\nTheorem 2 yields a new form of the induction law for ordered fields.\nTheorem 2\u2032 (Second induction law). A proposition P(n) holds for each nat-\nural n in an ordered field if\n(i\u2032) P(1) holds, and\n(ii\u2032) whenever P(n) holds for all naturals n less than some m N, it also\n\u2208\nholds for n = m.\n6This is the so-called well-ordering property of N. A simpler proof for E1 will be given\nin 10. Thus the present proof may be omitted.\n\u00a7 68 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\n\u2217\nProof. We use a so-called indirect proof or proof by contradiction. That is,\ninstead of proving our assertion directly, we shall show that the opposite is\nfalse, and so our theorem must be true.\nThusassume(i\u2032)and(ii\u2032)and,seekingacontradiction,supposeP(n)fails for\nsome n N (call such n \u201cbad\u201d). Then these \u201cbad\u201d naturals form a nonempty\n\u2208\nsubset of N, call it A. By Theorem 2, A has a least member m. Thus m is the\nleast natural for which P(n) fails. It follows that all n less than m do satisfy\nP(n) (among them is 1 by (i\u2032)). But then, by our assumption (ii\u2032), P(n) also\nholds for n = m, which is impossible since m is \u201cbad\u201d by construction.\nThis contradiction shows that there cannot be any \u201cbad\u201d naturals, and the\ntheorem is proved. (cid:3)\nNote. In inductive proofs, Theorem 2\u2032 is used in much the same manner\nas Theorem 1\u2032, but it leaves us more freedom in step (ii): instead of assuming\nthat just P(m) is true, we may assume that P(1), P(2), ..., P(m 1) are true.\n\u2212\nProblem. Verify Example (A) for mn. (See other problems in 6.)\n\u00a7\n\u00a76. Induction (continued)\nA similar induction law applies to definitions. It reads as follows.\nA notion C(n) is regarded as defined for every natural element of an ordered\nfield F if\n(i) it has been defined for n = 1, and\n(ii) some rule or formula is given that expresses C(n) in terms of C(1), C(2),\n..., C(n 1), i.e., in terms of all C(k) with k < n, or some of them.\n\u2212\nSuch definitions are referred to as inductive or recursive. Step (ii), i.e., the\nrule that defines C(n) in terms of all C(k), k < n, or some of them, is called the\nrecursive partofthedefinition. Wehavealreadyencounteredsuchdefinitionsin\nChapter 1, 8. The underlying intuitive idea is again a step-by-step procedure:\n\u00a7\nfirst, we define C(1); then, once C(1) is known, we may use it to define C(2);\nnext, once both C(1) and C(2) are known, we may use them to define C(3),\nand so on. The admissibility of inductive definitions can be proved rigorously,1\nin much the same manner as it was done in 5 for inductive proofs; however,\n\u00a7\nwe shall not go deeper into that problem.\nThe variable n in a recursive definition may run over the natural elements\nof any ordered field under consideration. However, for simplicity, we shall use\nonly those inductive definitions in which n ranges over the natural elements\nof E1, i.e., natural numbers. (Actually, this is no restriction; for, as we shall\n1Cf., e.g., P. Halmos, Naive Set Theory, D. Van Nostrand. 6. Induction (continued) 69\n\u00a7\nshow in 14, the natural elements in all ordered fields have exactly the same\n\u00a7\nmathematical properties and may be \u201cidentified\u201d with the natural numbers in\nE1.) The expression C(n) itself need not denote a number; it may be of quite\narbitrary nature.\nWe shall now illustrate this procedure by several important examples of\ninductive definitions to be used throughout our later work.\nDefinition 1.\nGiven an element x of a field F, we define the n-th power of x, denoted\nxn, for every natural number n E1 (n = 1,2,3,...) by setting\n\u2208\n(i) x1 = x and (ii) xn = xn\u22121x, n = 2,3,... .\nBy the inductive law expressed above, xn is defined for every natural\nn. Intuitively, we may think of it as a step-by-step definition:\nx1 = x, x2 = x1x = xx, x3 = x2x = (xx)x = xxx,\nand so on, indefinitely. Thus, formulas (i) and (ii) actually replace an\ninfinite sequence of definitions, obtained consecutively by setting n =\n2, 3, 4,... in (ii) and substituting the value of xn\u22121 known from the\npreceding step.\n1\nIf x = 0, we also define x0 = 1 and x\u2212n = , n = 1, 2, ... (division\n6 xn\nmakes sense if x = 0). The expression 00 remains undefined.\n6\nDefinition 2.\nFor every natural number n, we define recursively the expression n! (read\n\u201cn factorial\u201d) as follows:\n(i) 1! = 1; (ii) n! = (n 1)! n, n = 2, 3, ....\n\u2212 \u00b7\nThus, e.g., 2! = (1!) 2 = 2; 3! = (2!) 3 = 6, etc. We also define 0! = 1.\n\u00b7 \u00b7\nDefinition 3.\nThe sum and product of n elements x , ..., x F of a field, denoted\n1 n\n\u2208\nby\nx +x + +x and x x x\n1 2 n 1 2 n\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nn n\n(or x and x ), respectively, aredefinedrecursivelyasfollows:\nk=1 k k=1 k\nP 1 Q n n\u22121\nSums: (i) x = x ; (ii) x = x +x , n = 2,3,... ;\nk 1 k k n\nk=1 k=1 (cid:18)k=1 (cid:19)\nX X X\n1 n n\u22121\nProducts: (i) x = x ; (ii) x = x x , n = 2,3,... .\nk 1 k k n\n\u00b7\nk=1 k=1 (cid:18)k=1 (cid:19)\nY Y Y 70 Chapter 2.

Problem 13).\nInductioncanbeusedtodefinethenotionofanordered n-tuple iftheconcept\nof an ordered pair is assumed to be known. In fact, an ordered triple can be\nregarded as an ordered pair of the form\n((x , x ),x ),\n1 2 3\nthat is, as a pair in which the left coordinate is itself a pair. Similarly, an\nordered quadruple is a pair\n((x , x , x ),x )\n1 2 3 4\nin which the left coordinate is an ordered triple (x , x , x ), and so on. This\n1 2 3\nleads to the following definition.\nDefinition 4.\nFor any objects x ,x ,...,x , the ordered n-tuple (x ,...,x ) is defined\n1 2 n 1 n\nby\n(i) (x ) = x (i.e., an ordered \u201cone-tuple\u201d (x ) is x itself);\n1 1 1 1\n(ii) (x , ..., x ) = ((x , ..., x ),x ), n = 2, 3, 4,... .\n1 n 1 n\u22121 n\nAccordingly, we may now also define the Cartesian product\nA A A\n1 2 n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7\nof n sets (see the end of 4 in Chapter 1) either as the set of all n-tuples\n\u00a7\n(x ,...,x ) such that x A , k = 1, 2, ..., n, or directly by induction:\n1 n k k\n\u2208 n\nAssuming the definition is known for two factors and writing A\nk=1 k\nfor A A A , we define\n1 2 n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7 Q\n1 n n\u22121\n(i) A = A and (ii) A = A A , n = 1,2,... .\nk 1 k k n\n\u00d7\nk=1 k=1 (cid:18)k=1 (cid:19)\nY Y Y\nSometimes we start an inductive proof or definition not with n = 1 but with\nn = 0 or with n = 2, say.

We proceed by induction.1 Fix m N, and let P(n) mean m n J.\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2208\n(i) P(1) is true. Indeed, m 1 = 0 or m 1 N by Example (B) in 5.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2208 \u00a7\nThus m 1 J, by definition. But this means that P(n) holds for n = 1.\n\u2212 \u2208\n(ii) P(k) = P(k+1). Suppose P(n) holds for some particular n = k. This\n\u21d2\nmeans that m k J; that is, m k N or m k = 0 or (m k) N.\n\u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nWe must show that this implies [m (k+1)] J, i.e., [(m k) 1] J.\n\u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\n1If F is an ordered field, one can simply apply Example (D) in 5. Indeed, we have\n\u00a7\nm n N, m n = 0, or (m n) N accordingly as m > n, m = n, or m < n. Thus\n\u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nm n J by definition. This may suffice at a first reading.\n\u2212 \u2208 7.

This settles the case m k N.\n\u00a7 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2208\nIf m k = 0, then (m k) 1 = 1 J by definition.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nFinally, if (m k) N, then (m k)+1 N; that is, [m (k+1)] N,\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208 \u2212 \u2212 \u2208\nand so, by definition, [m (k+1)] J. But this means that P(k+1) is true.\n\u2212 \u2208\nThus, in all three cases, P(k + 1) results from P(k). This completes the\ninduction, and so P(n) holds for every n N, i.e., m n J for any m,n\nN. (cid:3) \u2208 \u2212 \u2208 \u2208\nTheorem 1. If x and y are integers in a field F, so are x+y and xy.2\nProof. As x,y J, we must consider the following possible cases.\n\u2208\n(i) If x and y are both naturals, so are x+y and xy by Example (A) in 5.\n\u00a7\nThus they are integers, as claimed.\n(ii) If x or y is 0, all is trivial (we leave this case to the reader).\n(iii) If x and y are both additive inverses of naturals, then x and y are\n\u2212 \u2212\nnaturals; hence so is their sum, ( x) + ( y) = (x + y). This shows\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nthat x + y is the additive inverse of a natural element; so x + y J by\n\u2208\ndefinition. Similarly xy = ( x)( y) N; hence certainly xy J.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2208 \u2208\n(iv) Suppose that one of x and y (say x) is a natural element while the other\n(y) is not. Then either y = 0 or y N.

Hence xy is an integer, being\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2208\nthe additive inverse of the natural element x( y) = xy.\n\u2212 \u2212\nThus, in all cases, x+y J and xy J. The theorem is proved.

The Real Number System\nTheorem 2. The sum, the difference, and the product of two rationals x and\ny in a field F are rational. So also is x/y if y = 0.\n6\nProof. Let x = p/q and y = r/s, where p, q, r, s are integers, with q and s\ndifferent from 0. Then, as is easily seen (cf. Problem 3 in 4),\n\u00a7\nps qr pr x ps\nx y = \u00b1 , xy = , and =\n\u00b1 qs qs y qr\n(the latter provided that y and r, too, are different from zero). Thus x y,\n\u00b1\nxy, and x/y can be written as fractions with integral numerators and denomi-\nnators. (The fact that numerators and denominators are integers follows from\nTheorem 1. It is also easily seen that these denominators are not 0 since q, r,\ns = 0.) By Definition 2, they are rational elements of F, as required. (cid:3)\n6\nIt follows, in particular, that x is rational whenever x is; similarly for\n\u2212\nx\u22121 = 1/x if x = 0. All integers (including 0 and 1) are rationals since an\n6\ninteger m can be written as m/1.\nIt is easy to verify that Axioms I to IX remain valid if E1 is replaced by the\nset R of all rational elements of an ordered field F.

The Real Number System\nIn this case, p and q are called, respectively, a lower (or left) and an\nupper (or right) bound of A.\nIf A is both left- and right-bounded, it is simply referred to as bounded\n(by p and q). The empty set is always regarded as bounded, and all\n\u2205\nelements of F are considered both its lower and upper bounds.\nNote. The bounds p and q may, but need not, belong to the set A.\nIf a set A is bounded below, it has many lower bounds; for if p is one of\nthem, so also is every element less than p. Similarly, a right-bounded set always\nhas many upper bounds.\nAll this applies, in particular, to sets of real numbers, i.e., sets in E1.\nExamples.\n(1) The set of four numbers 1, 2,3,7 is bounded, both above (e.g., by 7,\n{ \u2212 }\n8, 9, 100, etc.) and below (e.g., by 2, 5, 12, etc.).\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n(2) ThesetofallnaturalnumbersN = 1,2,3,... isboundedbelow(e.g.,by\n{ }\n1, 0, 1, 9, etc.) but not above. (An exact proof of this fact will be\n\u22122 \u2212\ngiven later, after the introduction of the missing 10th axiom, on which it\nis based.) On the other hand, the set of all negative integers is bounded\nabove but not below.\n(3) The set J of all integers has no lower and no upper bounds in E1. In\nfact, given any number p E1, one can always find an integer > p and\n\u2208\nan integer < p. Thus no such p can be a lower or an upper bound for J.\nGeometrically, an upper bound of a set A E1 is a point q on the real axis\n\u2282\nthat lies on the right side of A, while a lower bound p lies on the left side; see\nFigure 9.\nA\np q\nz }| {\nFigure 9\nAn especially important class of bounded sets form the so-called intervals.\nDefinition 2.\nGiven any real numbers a and b (a b), we define\n\u2264\n(i) the open interval (a,b) to be the set of all real numbers x such that\na < x < b, i.e.,\n(a,b) = x E1 a < x < b ;\n{ \u2208 | } 8. Bounded Sets in an Ordered Field 79\n\u00a7\n(ii) the closed interval [a,b] to be the set of all real numbers x such that\na x b, i.e.,\n\u2264 \u2264\n[a,b] = x E1 a x b .\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 \u2264 }\nWe also define, in a similar way, the half-open interval (a,b] and the half-\nclosed interval [a,b) by the inequalities a < x b and a x < b, respectively.\n\u2264 \u2264\nThe same definitions also apply to intervals in any ordered field F.\nIn all cases, a and b are called the endpoints of the interval. Note that a\nbelongs to [a,b] and [a,b) but not to (a,b) and (a,b], while b belongs to [a,b]\nand (a,b] but not to (a,b) and [a,b) (square brackets are written beside those\nendpoints that are included in the interval). If a = b, i.e., if the endpoints\ncoincide, the interval is said to be degenerate. In this case the closed interval\n[a,a] consists of a single point, a, while (a,a) = (a,a] = [a,a) = . (Why?)\n\u2205\nEvery interval is a bounded set since its endpoints are its bounds by its very\ndefinition. Geometrically, intervals are segments of the real axis.\nIf an upper bound q of a set A is itself in A, then q is clearly the greatest\nelement of A (i.e., one not exceeded by any other element of A). We then also\ncall it the maximum of A, denoted maxA. Similarly, if A contains its lower\nbound p, then p is its least element, also called the minimum of A or, briefly,\nminA. A set A can have at most one maximum and one minimum; for if, say,\nq and q\u2032 were both maxima, then by definition, q q\u2032 (since q A and q\u2032 is an\n\u2264 \u2208\nupper bound) and, similarly, q\u2032 q, so that q = q\u2032. However, a set may have\n\u2264\nno maximum and no minimum even if it is bounded; such a set is, for example,\nevery open interval. (Why?) We denote by max(a,b) the larger of the two\nelements a and b; similarly for min(a,b) and for sets of several elements.\nIt is important to note that every nonempty finite set A in an ordered field\nmust have a maximum and a minimum. This is easily proved by induction on\nthe number n of elements in A; the details are left to the reader (cf. Problem 15\nin 6). In particular, given n real numbers x , x , ..., x , one of them must\n1 2 n\n\u00a7\nbe the largest, i.e., max(x ,...,x ), and one of them must be the smallest,\n1 n\ni.e., min(x ,...,x ).\n1 n\n\u00a79. The Completeness Axiom. Suprema and Infima\nIn 8 it was shown that a right-bounded set of real numbers always has many\n\u00a7\nupper bounds. The question arises as to whether or not there exists among\nthem a least one. Similarly, one may ask whether or not a left-bounded set\nalways has a greatest lower bound, i.e., one \u201cclosest\u201d to the set.\nGeometrically, this problem may be illustrated as follows. Figure 10 shows\na bounded set M of real numbers plotted on the real axis. 80 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nM\n\u2032 \u2032\nu u v v\nz }| {\np q\nFigure 10\nThe points u and v on the axis represent a lower and an upper bound of M,\nrespectively. It is, however, evident from Figure 10 that v is not the least upper\nbound since also the smaller number v\u2032 is an upper bound of M. Similarly, u\nis not the greatest lower bound since there is a greater lower bound, u\u2032.\nNow imagine that the point v moves along the axis in the direction of the\nset M but remaining to the right of all points of M. It is geometrically evident\nthat v will eventually arrive at a certain position q where it can no longer\ncontinue its motion without passing some points of M, i.e., without ceasing to\nbe an upper bound of M. This very position q (if it actually exists) is clearly\nthat of the least upper bound. Similarly, by moving the point u in the positive\ndirection, one arrives at a position p that corresponds to the greatest lower\nbound of M. Note that p and q need not be the minimum and maximum of M.\nFor example, if M is the open interval (p,q), it has no minimum or maximum\nat all. Nevertheless, p and q are its greatest lower, and least upper, bounds.\n(To fix ideas, assume that M in Figure 10 has no maximum or minimum).\nThese geometric considerations, however plausible, cannot be considered a\nrigorous proof of the existence of the least upper and greatest lower bounds.\nThis proof also cannot be derived from the nine axioms stated thus far. On\nthe other hand, the existence of the least upper and greatest lower bounds is of\nvery great importance for the entire mathematical analysis. Therefore, it has\nto be introduced as a special axiom, which, for reasons to be explained later,\nis called the completeness axiom. It is the last (tenth) axiom in our system.\nCompleteness Axiom.\nX Every nonvoid right-bounded set M of real numbers has a least upper\nbound (also called the supremum of M, abbreviated supM or l.u.b. M).\nNo special axiom is needed for lower bounds since the corresponding propo-\nsition can now be proved from the completeness axiom, as follows.\nTheorem 1. Every nonvoid left-bounded set M of real numbers has a greatest\nlower bound (also called the infimum of M, abbreviated infM or g.l.b. M).\nProof. Let B denote the (nonvoid) set of all lower bounds of M (such bounds\nexist since M is left-bounded). Clearly, each element of M is, in turn, an upper\nbound for B (because no element of B can exceed any element of M by the\ndefinition of a lower bound). Thus B is nonvoid and right-bounded. By the\ncompleteness axiom, B has a supremum, call it p. We shall now prove that p\nis also the required infimum of M. Indeed, we have the following:\n(i) p is a lower bound of M; for p is, by definition, the least of all upper 9. The Completeness Axiom. Suprema and Infima 81\n\u00a7\nbounds of B. But, as we have seen, all elements of M are such upper\nbounds; so p cannot exceed anyone of them, as required.\n(ii) p is the greatest lower bound of M. In fact, as p is an upper bound of B,\nit is not exceeded by any element of B. But, by definition, B contains all\nlower bounds of M; so p is not exceeded by any one of them.\nThis completes the proof. (cid:3)\nNote 1. Theorem 1 could, in turn, be assumed as an axiom. Then our\ncompleteness axiom could be deduced from it in a similar manner.\nNote 2. The supremum and infimum of a set M (if they exist) are unique;\nfor the infimum of M is, by definition, the greatest element of the set B of all\nlower bounds of M, i.e., maxB. But maxB is unique, as shown at the end of\n8; hence so is infM. Similarly for supM.\n\u00a7\nNote 3. To explain the \u201ccompleteness axiom\u201d, consider again Figure 10\nand imagine that the points p and q have been removed from the axis, leaving\ntwo \u201cgaps\u201d in it. Then the set M, though bounded, would have no supremum\nand no infimum since the required points would be missing. The completeness\naxiom asserts, in fact, that such \u201cgaps\u201d never occur, i.e., that the real axis is\n\u201ccomplete\u201d.\nAs we mentioned, the completeness axiom is independent of the first nine\naxioms, i.e., cannot be deduced from them. In fact, there are ordered fields\nthat do not satisfy it, though they certainly satisfy the first nine axioms. Such\na field is, e.g., the field of all rational numbers (see 11). On the other hand,\n\u00a7\nsome ordered fields do have the completeness property, and E1 is one of them.\nThis justifies the following definition.\nDefinition.\nAn ordered field F is said to be complete iff every nonvoid right-bounded\nsubset M of F has a supremum (i.e., a least upper bound) in F.\nIn particular, E1 is a complete ordered field by the completeness axiom. We\ncan now restate Theorem 1 in a more general form:\n\u2032\nTheorem 1 . In a complete ordered field F, every nonvoid left-bounded set\nM F has an infimum (i.e., a greatest lower bound).\n\u2282\nThe proof is exactly the same as in Theorem 1.\nAlso the following corollaries will be stated for ordered fields in general.\nThey apply, of course, to E1 as well.\nCorollary 1. An element q of an ordered field F is the supremum of a set\nM F iff q satisfies these two conditions:\n\u2282\n(i) ( x M) x q; i.e., q is not exceeded by any element x in M.\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2264 82 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\n(ii) Every element p < q is exceeded by some x in M, i.e.,\n( p < q) ( x M) p < x.\n\u2200 \u2203 \u2208\nA similar result holds for the infimum (with all inequalities reversed).\nIn fact, condition (i) states that q is an upper bound of M, while (ii) states\nthat no smaller element p F is such a bound (since it is exceeded by some\n\u2208\nx M). When combined, (i) and (ii) mean that q is the least upper bound.\n\u2208\nNote 4. Every element p < q can be written as q \u01eb, where \u01eb > 0. Hence\n\u2212\nCondition (ii) in Corollary 1 can also be rephrased thusly:\n(ii\u2032) For every field element \u01eb > 0, there is an x M with q \u01eb < x.\n\u2208 \u2212\nIn case q = infM, we have instead that\n( \u01eb > 0) ( x M) q +\u01eb > x.1\n\u2200 \u2203 \u2208\nCorollary 2. Let M be a nonempty set in an ordered field F, and let b F.\n\u2208\nIf each element x of M satisfies the inequality x b (x b), so does supM\n\u2264 \u2265\n(infM, respectively), provided that supM (infM) exists.\nIn fact, the condition\n( x M) x b\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2264\nmeans that b is an upper bound of M. But supM is the least upper bound of\nM, so (supM) b; similarly for infM.\n\u2264\nCorollary 3. If A and B are subsets of an ordered field, both nonvoid, and if\nA B, then\n\u2286\nsupA supB and infA infB,\n\u2264 \u2265\nprovided that the suprema and infima involved exist.

Some Applications of the Completeness Axiom\nFrom everyday experience, one knows that even a large distance y can be\nmeasured by a small yardstick x; one only has to mark x off sufficiently many\ntimes. This fact was noticed by ancient Greeks; it goes back to the Greek\ngeometer and scientist Archimedes. Mathematically, it means that, given a\npositivenumberx(nomatterhowsmall)andanothernumbery (nomatterhow\nlarge), there always is a natural number n such that nx > y. This fact, known\nas the Archimedean property, holds not only for real numbers (i.e., in E1) but\nalso in many other ordered fields. All such fields are called Archimedean fields\nto distinguish them from other fields in which this property fails. In particular,\nweshallnowprovethateverycomplete field(suchasE1)isArchimedean. That\nis, we have following. 86 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nTheorem 1 (Archimedean property). If x and y are elements of a complete\nordered field F (e.g., E1) and if x > 0, then there always is a natural n F\n\u2208\nsuch that nx > y.\nWe shall prove this theorem by showing that the opposite assertion is im-\npossible since it leads to a contradiction; it will then follow that our theorem\nmust be true.\nThus, given a fixed element x > 0, assume (seeking a contradiction) that\nthere is no natural n with nx > y. Then, for all natural n, we have nx y.\n\u2264\nThis means that y is an upper bound of the set of all products\nnx (n = 1, 2, 3, ...);\ncall this set M. Clearly, M is nonvoid and bounded above (by y); so, by the\nassumed completeness of F, M has a supremum, say, q = supM. As q is an\nupper bound of M, we have (by the definition of M) that nx q for each\n\u2264\nnatural element n. But if n is a natural element, so is n+1. Thus, replacing\nn by n+1, we get (n+1)x q, whence\n\u2264\nnx q x, n = 1, 2, 3, ... .\n\u2264 \u2212\nIn other words, q x (which is less than q since x > 0) is another upper\n\u2212\nbound of all nx, i.e., of the set M. But this is impossible because q = supM\nis by definition the least upper bound of M; so no smaller element, such as\nq x, can be its upper bound. This contradiction shows that the negation of\n\u2212\nour theorem must be false. The theorem is proved.\nNote 1. The theorem also holds, with the same proof, for \u201cnatural multi-\nples\u201d nx = x+x+ +x as defined in 6 (see the note after Definition 3).\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a7\nNote 2. Theorem 1 shows that no complete ordered field, such as E1 can\ncontain so-called \u201cinfinitely small\u201d elements, supposedly = 0 but such that all\n6\ntheir integral multiples are less than 1. (However, such elements do exist in\nnon-Archimedean fields; and recent research, due to A. Robinson, made use of\nthem in what is now generally called \u201cNonstandard Analysis\u201d.)\nCorollary 1. Given any element y in an Archimedean field F, there always\nare naturals m,n N such that m < y < n.\n\u2208 \u2212\nProof. Given any y F, use the Archimedean property (with x = 1) to find\n\u2208\na natural n F such that n 1 > y, i.e., n > y. Similarly there is another\nnatural m su\u2208 ch that m > y, \u00b7 i.e., m < y < n. (cid:3)\n\u2212 \u2212\nCorollary 2. In any Archimedean field, the set N of all naturals has no upper\nbound, and the set J of all integers has neither upper nor lower bounds. (The\nnegative integers are not bounded below.)\nFor, by Corollary 1, no element y F can be an upper bound of N (being\n\u2208\nexceeded by n N), nor can it be a lower bound of the negative integers (since\n\u2208 10. Some Applications of the Completeness Axiom 87\n\u00a7\nit exceeds some m, m N).\n\u2212 \u2208\nAlthough our next theorem is valid in all Archimedean fields (see Problem 2\nbelow), a simpler proof (avoiding the use of Theorem 2 of 5) can be given for\n\u00a7\ncomplete fields, such as E1. This is our purpose here.\nTheorem 2. In an Archimedean field F, every nonvoid right-bounded set of\nintegers has a maximum, and every nonvoid left-bounded set of integers has a\nminimum.\nProof for complete fields. Let M be a nonvoid right-bounded set of integers\nin a complete field F. By completeness, M has a supremum, call it q. The\ntheoremwillbeprovedifweshowthatq M (for, anupperboundthatbelongs\n\u2208\nto the set is its maximum). To prove it, we assume the opposite, q / M, and\n\u2208\nseek a contradiction.\nConsider the element q 1. As q 1 < q, Corollary 1 of 9 shows that q 1 is\n\u2212 \u2212 \u00a7 \u2212\nexceeded by some element x M. Since q / M, q cannot equal x. Therefore,\n\u2208 \u2208\nas q is an upper bound of M, we have x < q, so that q 1 < x < q. Now, as\n\u2212\nx < q, Corollary 1 of 9 yields another element y M such that x < y < q,\n\u00a7 \u2208\nand so\nq 1 < x < y < q.\n\u2212\nBut this is impossible because x and y are integers (being elements of M),\nand no two distinct integers can lie between q 1 and q (indeed, this would\n\u2212\nimply 0 < y x < 1, with y x a positive integer, contrary to what was shown\n\u2212 \u2212\nin Example (C) of 5).\n\u00a7\nThis contradiction shows that q must belong to M, and hence q = maxM,\nproving the first clause of the theorem. The second clause is proved quite\nsimilarly. We leave it to the reader. (cid:3)\nWe now use Theorem 2 to obtain two further results.\nCorollary 3. Given any element x of an Archimedean field F, there always\nis a unique integer n F such that\n\u2208\nn x < n+1.\n\u2264\n(This integer is called the integral part of x, denoted [x].)\nProof. By Corollary 1, there are integers x. Clearly, the set of all such\n\u2264\nintegers (call it M) is bounded above by x. Hence, by Theorem 2, M has a\nmaximum; call it n. Thus, n is the greatest integer x. It follows that n+1\n\u2264\ncannot be x, and so n+1 > x n. Thus n has the desired property. This\n\u2264 \u2265\nproperty, in turn, implies that n = maxM. Hence n is unique, as maxM\nis. (cid:3)\nExamples. [1] = 0; [ 11] = 2; [ 4] = 4; [\u221a2] = 1.\n2 \u2212 4 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 88 Chapter 2.

Hence the inequality\n\u2265\n(1) can only be strengthened if we replace in it \u01eb by various natural powers of\n\u01eb.

Clearly, p 0 since p = supM and, by definition, all\n\u2265\nelements of M are 0. We shall now show that this p is the required element\n\u2265\nof F, i.e., that pn = a.\n1At a first reading, the beginner may omit this proof, noting only the lemma itself. 92 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nIndeed, if pn were less than a, then by the previous lemma, there would be\nsome x > p such that xn < a, i.e., x M. But this is impossible because no\n\u2208\nelement x of M can exceed the supremum p of M.\nOn the other hand, if pn > a, then again by the lemma, there is some q < p\n(q 0) with qn > a. Then for every x M, we have xn a < qn, whence\n\u2265 \u2208 \u2264\n(since everything is nonnegative) x < q. Thus q exceeds all elements x M,\n\u2208\ni.e., q is an upper bound of M. But this is impossible because q < p and p is\nthe least upper bound of M.\nThus we see that the inequalities pn < a and pn > a are impossible; and\nit follows by trichotomy that pn = a, as asserted. It remains to prove the\nuniqueness of p. Suppose that there is yet another element r F (r > 0) with\n\u2208\nrn = a = pn. Then\n0 = rn pn = (r p)(rn1 +rn\u22122p+ +pn\u22121).\n\u2212 \u2212 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nDividing by the positive bracketed expression, we obtain r p = 0, whence\nr = p after all. This shows that p is indeed unique. (cid:3) \u2212\nNote 1. \u221an a will always denote the nonnegative value of the root. As usual,\nwe write \u221aa for \u221a2 a.\nTheorem 2. Every complete ordered field F (such as E1) contains irrational\nelements. In particular, \u221a2 is irrational.\nProof. By Theorem 1, F contains the element p = \u221a2, with p2 = 2. Seeking\na contradiction, we assume that \u221a2 is rational, i.e.,\nm\n\u221a2 =\nn\nfor some natural elements m and n.\nNow, by Theorem 2 of 10 (or Problem 5 of 7), we choose the least possible\n\u00a7 \u00a7\nsuch m. Then m and n are not both even (otherwise reduction by 2 would yield\na smaller m). From\nm\n= \u221a2,\nn\nwe obtain m2 = 2n2, whence m2 is even. But, as is easily seen, only even\nelements have even squares. Thus m itself must be even; i.e., m = 2r for some\nnatural element r. It follows that 4r2 = m2 = 2n2, whence 2r2 = n2; and the\nsame argument shows that n must be even. But this is a contradiction since m\nand n are not both even.\nThis contradiction shows that, indeed, 2 is irrational, and thus the theorem\nis proved. (cid:3)\nNote 2. In a similar manner one can prove the irrationality of \u221an, where\nthe natural n is not a full square. Moreover, one can show that the irrationals\nare dense in E1 (cf. Problem 4 below; also, Chapter 1, 9, Corollary 4).\n\u00a7 11. Roots. Irrational Numbers 93\n\u00a7\nNote 3.

The Real Number System\n\u2217\n\u00a712. Powers with Arbitrary Real Exponents\nIn 11, we proved the existence and uniqueness of\n\u00a7\n\u221an a (n = 1, 2, ...)\nfor elements a 0 in a complete ordered field. Using this, we shall now define\n\u2265\nthe power ar for any rational r > 0.\nDefinition 1.\nGiven any element a 0 in a complete ordered field F and any rational\n\u2265\nnumber r = m/n > 0 (where m and n are natural numbers in E1), we\ndefine\nar = \u221an am.\nHere we must clarify two facts:\n(1) In case n = 1, we have\nar = am/1 = \u221a1 am = am.\nThus for natural values of r, our new definition agrees with the original\nmeaning of am (as defined in 6), and so contradictions are excluded.\n\u00a7\n(2) Our definition does not depend on the particular representation of r in\nm\nthe form , and thus is unambiguous. Indeed, if r is represented as a\nn\nfraction in two different ways,\nm p\nr = = ,\nn q\nthen mq = np, whence amq = apn, i.e., (am)q = (ap)n.\nNow, by definition, \u221an am is exactly the element whose n-th power is\nam, i.e.,\n(\u221an am)n = am.\nSimilarly, (\u221aq ap)q = ap. Substituting this for am and ap in the equation\n(am)q = (ap)n,\nwe get\n(\u221an am)nq = (\u221aq ap)nq, whence \u221an am = \u221aq ap\n(by taking the nq-th root of both sides). Thus, indeed, all representations\nof r yield the same value of \u221an am = ar, and so ar is well defined.\nBy using our definition of \u221an a (which can now also be written as a1/n) and\nthe formulas statedin Problems 11and 7in 6, the readerwill easily verify that\n\u00a7 \u2217 12. Powers with Arbitrary Real Exponents 95\n\u00a7\nthese formulas remain valid also for powers ar (a > 0) with rational exponents\n> 0 as defined above.

Let A denote the set of all elements of F of the form ax, where x is\nar\na rational number, 0 < x r; i.e.,\n\u2264\nA = ax 0 < x r, x rational .\nar\n{ | \u2264 }\nBy the density of rationals in E1 (Theorem 3 of 10), such rationals x exist;\n\u00a7\nso A = .\nar\n6 \u2205\nMoreover, A is right-bounded in F.

Thus, ay is an upper bound of\n\u2212\nall ax in A .\nar\nBy the assumed completeness of F, supA exists; so we may (and do)\nar\ndefine\nar = supA .1\nar\nWe also define\n1\na\u2212r = .\nar\n1\nIf 0 < a < 1 (so that > 1), we set\na\n1 \u2212r 1\nar = and a\u2212r = ,\na ar\n(cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17)\nwhere\n1 r\n= supA ,\n1/a,r\na\n(cid:16) (cid:17)\nas above.

Decimal and Other Approximations\nThe reader is certainly familiar with decimal approximations of real numbers;\ne.g.,\n\u221a2 = 1.414213... .\nA terminating decimal fraction is a sum of powers of 10 multiplied by certain\ncoefficients (the \u201cdigits\u201d); e.g.,\n1.413 = 1 100 +4 10\u22121 +1 10\u22122 +3 10\u22123.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nThe idea behind decimal approximations is best explained geometrically.\nGiven a real number x > 0, we first find a \u201ccoarse\u201d decimal approximation of\nthe form 10s\u22121 x < 10s, where s is an integer (possibly 0 or negative).\n\u2264\nNote 1. Such an s exists and is unique. For, by the binomial theorem,\n10n = (1+9)n = 1+9n+ > 9n;\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nhence, by the Archimedean property, 10n > 9n > x for large n. Similarly,\n1\n10m > for some natural m, and so\nx\n10\u2212m < x < 10n.\nThus, the set of all integers n such that 10n > x is nonvoid and bounded below\n(e.g., by m). By Theorem 2 of 10, there is a least such n; call it s. Then\n\u2212 \u00a7\n10s > x 10s\u22121,\n\u2265\nas required.\nThus, x is in the interval [10s\u22121,10s). To find a better approximation, we\nsubdivide this interval into 9 equal subintervals of length 10s\u22121. Then x must\nbe in one of these subintervals; let it be\n[x , x +10s\u22121),\n1 1\nwhere x is some multiple of 10s\u22121; say,\n1\nx = m 10s\u22121.\n1 1\n\u00b7 \u2217 13.

Again one of them must contain x; let it be\n[x , x +10s\u22122),\n2 2\nwhere x is obtained from x by marking off some multiple of 10s\u22122; say,\n2 1\nx = x +m 10s\u22122.\n2 1 2\n\u00b7\nThen we subdivide the interval [x , x +10s\u22122) into 10 still smaller intervals,\n2 2\nof length 10s\u22123, and so on. At the n-th step, x is enclosed in an interval\n[x , x +10s\u2212n),\nn n\napproximating x to within 10s\u2212n. Thus one obtains decimal approximations\nas accurate as is desired.\nInstead of using powers of 10, one could use powers of any other number\nq > 1 to obtain, quite similarly, approximations to within qs\u2212n. Moreover, this\nis possible not only in E1, but in any Archimedean field F.\nIndeed, fixing q > 1 and any x > 0 in F, we find, exactly as before, a whole\nnumber s such that\nqs\u22121 x < qs.\n\u2264\nThen, by the Archimedean property of F there is an integer m in F such that\n1\n(m +1)qs\u22121 > x.\n1\nTaking the least such m , we also achieve that\n1\nm qs\u22121 x.\n1\n\u2264\n(Why?) For brevity, let x = m qs\u22121, so\n1 1\nx x < x +qs\u22121.\n1 1\n\u2264\nWe also put x = 0. Note that 1 m < q.

Then we have\nx y < x < x +qs\u2212n,\nn n\n\u2264\nand hence\n0 < x y < (x +qs\u2212n) x = qs\u2212n,\nn n\n\u2212 \u2212\ni.e., 0 < x y < qs/qn, or\n\u2212\nqn(x y) < qs, n = 1, 2, 3, ... .\n\u2212\nBut this is incompatible with the Archimedean property. (Why?) Thus the\ntheorem is proved. (cid:3)\nIf the field F is complete and q is an integer > 1, the process described\nabove can be reversed. More precisely, we have the following.\nTheorem 2. Let s be an integer in E1, and let q and m (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) be\nn\nintegers in a complete field F, with q > 1, 0 m q 1, and m 1. If the\nn 1\n\u2264 \u2264 \u2212 \u2265\nsequence m does not terminate in q 1, there is a unique element x > 0 in\nn\n{ } \u2212\nF, whose q-ary expansion, as defined above, is exactly s, m , m , ..., m , ... .\n1 2 n\nProof. With q, s and m as above, define\nn\nn n\nx = m qs\u2212k, y = (q 1)qs\u2212k, n = 1, 2, 3, ...,\nn k n\n\u2212\nk=1 k=1\nX X\nso that the x are as in (2). As m q 1, we have x y . Moreover, as\nn k n n\n\u2264 \u2212 \u2264\nm does not terminate in q 1, we have m < q 1 for infinitely many k,\nk k\n{ } \u2212 \u2212\nand hence x < y for large n so that d = y x > 0, and the differences\nn n n n n\n\u2212 102 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nd increase with n. So also do x and y . Let d be one of the d > 0. Then,\nn n n n\nfor sufficiently large n, y x = d > d > 0, and we obtain\nn n n\n\u2212\nn n\nqs\u22121 m qs\u2212k = x < y d = (q 1)qs\u2212k d = qs qs\u2212n d < qs d.\nk n n\n\u2264 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nk=1 k=1\nX X\nThus, the set of all x is bounded above by qs d; so, by completeness, it\nn\n\u2212\nhas a supremum; call it x. By Corollary 2 of 9,\n\u00a7\nqs\u22121 x = supx qs d < qs.\nn\n\u2264 \u2264 \u2212\nAlso, for p > n, we obtain as above (for sufficiently large p and some d > 0)\n0\np\nx x = m qs\u2212k\np n k\n\u2212\nk=n+1\nX\np\n< (q 1)qs\u2212k d (3)\n0\n\u2212 \u2212\nk=n+1\nX\n= qs\u2212n qs\u2212p d\n0\n\u2212 \u2212\n< qs\u2212n d ,\n0\n\u2212\nwhence x < x +qs\u2212n d . Keeping n fixed and passing to sup x , we get\np n \u2212 0 p>n p\nx = supx x +qs\u2212n d < x +qs\u2212n.\np n 0 n\n\u2264 \u2212\np>n\nThus, x x < x +qs\u2212n for each n.\nn n\n\u2264\nFinally, from x = n m qs\u2212k, we obtain\nn k=1 k\nP n+1\nx = m qs\u2212k = x +m qs\u2212(n+1).\nn+1 k n n+1\nk=1\nX\nThis, combined with the previously obtained inequalities,\nx x < x +qs\u2212n and qs\u22121 x < qs,\nn n\n\u2264 \u2264\nshows that the x coincide with the q-ary approximations of x as defined in\nn\n(1) and (2), and that s, m , m , ..., m ,... is the q-ary expansion of x, as\n1 2 n\nrequired. The proof is complete. (cid:3)\nThus, we see that, for any integer q > 1 in a complete field F, there is a\none-to-one correspondence between positive elements x F and their q-ary\n\u2208\nexpansions, i.e., sequences s, m , m , ..., m , ..., not terminating in q 1\n1 2 n\n\u2212\nand such that 0 m < q and m 1 (with s an integer in E1, and m\nn 1 n\n\u2264 \u2265\nintegers in F).

The Real Number System\n\u2217\n\u00a714. Isomorphism of Complete Ordered Fields\nWe shall now show that, in a sense, there is only one complete ordered field.\nThat is, all such fields have the same mathematical properties as E1 and thus\ncannot be distinguished mathematically from E1.\nDefinition 1.\nTwo fields, F and F\u2032, are said to be isomorphic iff there is a one-to-one\nmapping f:F F\u2032 such that (denoting addition and multiplication in\no\u2194nto\nboth fields by the same symbols, + and )\n\u00b7\n( x,y F) f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y) and f(x y) = f(x) f(y). (1)\n\u2200 \u2208 \u00b7 \u00b7\nIf F and F\u2032 are ordered fields, we also require that\n( x,y F) x < y f(x) < f(y). (2)\n\u2200 \u2208 \u21d0\u21d2\nIn other words, the mapping f (called an isomorphism between F and F\u2032)\nestablishes a one-to-one correspondencebetween elements x F and f(x) F\u2032\n\u2208 \u2208\nthat carries the sum and product of any elements x,y F into the sum and\n\u2208\nproduct, respectively, of f(x) and f(y) in F\u2032. We briefly say that f preserves\nthe operations in F and F\u2032. In the ordered case, the map f is also supposed\nto preserve order (formula (2)). Writing briefly x\u2032 for f(x), we may say that,\nunder the correspondence x x\u2032, sums correspond to sums and products\n\u2194\ncorrespond to products:\n(x+y) (x\u2032 +y\u2032), xy x\u2032y\u2032.\n\u2194 \u2194\nThus, any formula valid in F can be \u201ctranslated\u201d into a formula valid in F\u2032;\none only has to replace\nx, y, z, ... F by x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032, ... F\u2032.\n\u2208 \u2208\nAnything that can be proved in F can also be proved in F\u2032, and conversely. In\nordered fields, this applies to inequalities as well, due to (2). Thus F\u2032 behaves\nexactly like F, as far as field operations and inequalities are concerned. There-\nfore, it is customary not to distinguish between two isomorphic fields F and\nF\u2032, even though their elements may be objects of different nature. (Compare\nthis to playing one and the same game of chess or cards with two different sets\nof chessmen or decks of cards: it is not the color or shape of the chessmen but\nthe game itself that really matters.)\nConsequently, if F andF\u2032 areisomorphic, we treat themas justtwo \u201ccopies\u201d\nof the same field; we call F\u2032 the isomorphic image of F (under the isomorphism\nf) and briefly write\nf\nF = F\u2032, or F = F\u2032.\n\u223c \u223c \u2217 14. Isomorphism of Complete Ordered Fields 105\n\u00a7\nThesamedefinitionsandconventionsalsoapplyifF andF\u2032 areanysets (not\nnecessarily fields) with some \u201caddition\u201d and \u201cmultiplication\u201d defined in them,\nsatisfying the closure law but not necessarily the other field axioms. If only one\noperationinF andF\u2032 (say, addition)isconsidered,ordefined, theisomorphism\nf is supposed to preserved this particular operation: f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y).\nWe then say that F and F\u2032 are isomorphic with respect to addition (though,\npossibly, not with respect to multiplication).1 Order isomorphism (2) may\napply to any ordered sets, regardless of operations.\nNote. If the map f satisfies (1) but is not necessarily one-to-one or onto\nF\u2032, we call it a homomorphism (of F into F\u2032).\nExamples.\n(a) Let F = E1 and let F\u2032 be the set of all ordered pairs of the form (x,0),\nx E1. For such pairs, define\n\u2208\n(x,0)+(y,0) = (x+y,0), (x,0) (y,0) = (xy,0);\n\u00b7\nand\n(x,0) < (y,0) x < y.\n\u21d0\u21d2\nIt is easy to verify that F\u2032 is an ordered field under these operations, and\nthe mapping x (x,0) is an isomorphism satisfying both (1) and (2).\n\u2194\nThus E1 = F\u2032.\n\u223c\n(b) Let N be the set of all natural numbers, and let N\u2032\u2032 be the set of all even\nelements of N. Define the mapping f:N N\u2032\u2032 by f(x) = 2x. This map\n\u2192\nis one-to-one and onto N\u2032\u2032. (Verify!) Moreover,\n( x,y N) f(x+y) = 2(x+y) = 2x+2y = f(x)+f(y).\n\u2200 \u2208\nThus f preservesaddition; soit is anisomorphismwith respect to addition\n(but not with respect to multiplication). It also preserves the order since\nwe have\nx < y iff 2x < 2y, i.e., f(x) < f(y).\nThus, N = N\u2032\u2032, with respect to addition and order.\n\u223c\n(c) The identity map I:F F, defined by I(x) = x, obviously preserves\n\u2194\nany operations or ordering defined in F; e.g., for multiplication, we have\nI(xy) = xy = I(x) I(y). Thus, I is an isomorphism of F onto itself:\n\u00b7\nI\nF = F.\n\u223c\nBelow, N and R will denote the naturals and rationals in E1, while N\u2032\nand R\u2032 are the corresponding sets in some arbitrary ordered field F. The\n1Of course, it does not matter whether the operation involved is denoted by (+) or some\nothersymbolandwhetheritis called\u201caddition\u201dorsomeothername. Itmayalsooccurthat\nthe operations in F and F\u2032 have different names and are differently denoted. 106 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nunity element of F is denoted by 1\u2032 to distinguish it from 1 E1. From 6\n\u2208 \u00a7\n(Definition 3 and the subsequent note), we recall that, for any n N and\n\u2208\na F,\n\u2208\nn a = na = a+a+ +a (n terms).\n\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nWe shall now define ra for any r R and a F.\n\u2208 \u2208\nDefinition 2.\nm\nGiven any element a of a field F, and a rational number r = E1\nn \u2208\n(m,n N), we define\n\u2208\nma\nr a = ra =\n\u00b7 n 1\u2032\n\u00b7\n(1\u2032 being the unity of F). We also put\n( r) a = ra and 0 a = 0\u2032 F.\n\u2212 \u00b7 \u2212 \u00b7 \u2208\nNote that ra F in all cases.\n\u2208\nThis definition is unambiguous, inasmuch as it does not depend on the par-\nticular representation of r as a fraction m/n. For, if r = m/n = p/q for some\nm, n, p, q N, then mq = np, whence (mq)(a 1\u2032) = (np)(a 1\u2032). It easily\n\u2208 \u00b7 \u00b7\nfollows [cf. Problem 11(vii) in 6] that (ma) (q1\u2032) = (pa)(n1\u2032), and hence\n\u00a7 \u00b7\npa ma\n= = ra.\nq1\u2032 n1\u2032\nThus, indeed, ra is uniquely determined. Moreover, if r N, i.e., r = m/1,\n\u2208\nthen\nma ma\nra = = = ma.\n1 1\u2032 1\u2032\n\u00b7\nThus, for a natural r, Definition 2 agrees with our previous definition of the\nnatural multiple ma, and so there is no danger of contradiction. We now obtain\nthe following.\nTheorem 1. For any elements a and b of a field F and any rational numbers\nr and s (in E1), we have the following:\n(i) ra+sa = (r +s)a;\n(ii) ra sb = (rs)(ab);\n\u00b7\n(iii) r(a+b) = ra+rb;\n(iv) if F is an ordered field, we also have ra < sa iff r < s, provided a > 0\u2032.\nIndeed, if r, s N, all this follows from Problems 11(vi)\u2013(viii) and 11\u2032 of\n\u2208\n6. The general case (r, s R) easily follows by Definition 2. We leave the\n\u00a7 \u2208\ndetails to the reader. \u2217 14. Isomorphism of Complete Ordered Fields 107\n\u00a7\nTheorem 2. The ordered subfield R of E1 (i.e., the field of all rational num-\nbers) is isomorphic with the rational subfield R\u2032 of any other ordered field F\n(with zero element 0\u2032 and unity 1\u2032).\nProof. As was noted at the end of 7, R and R\u2032 are ordered fields (subfields of\n\u00a7\nE1 and F, respectively). To establish their isomorphism, we define a mapping\nf:R R\u2032 by setting\n\u2192\nf(x) = x 1\u2032 for x R.\n\u00b7 \u2208\nThen, by Theorem 1, ( x,y R)\n\u2200 \u2208\nf(x+y) = (x+y) 1\u2032 = x1\u2032 +y1\u2032 = f(x)+f(y)\n\u00b7\nand\nf(xy) = (xy) 1\u2032 = (x1\u2032) (y1\u2032) = f(x) f(y).\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nThus, f preserves the operations.\nBy part (iv) of the theorem, f also preserves order. This also implies that\nf is one-to-one; for, if\nx = y (x,y R),\n6 \u2208\nthen either\nx < y or x > y,\nwhence\nf(x) < f(y) or f(x) > f(y),\nand in both cases f(x) = f(y), as required.\n6\nIt only remains to show that f is onto R\u2032, i.e., that each element r\u2032 R\u2032 has\n\u2208\nthe form r\u2032 = f(x) for some x R. Let\n\u2208\nm\u2032\nr\u2032 = (m\u2032,n\u2032 naturals in F).\nn\u2032\nNow, by Problem 11\u2032 of 6, we have\n\u00a7\nm\u2032 = m 1\u2032 and n\u2032 = n 1\u2032\n\u00b7 \u00b7\nfor some m,n N. Hence,\n\u2208\nm\u2032 m 1\u2032\nr\u2032 = = \u00b7 .\nn\u2032 n 1\u2032\n\u00b7\nSetting x = m/n, we have, by definition,\nm1\u2032\nf(x) = x 1\u2032 = = r\u2032.\n\u00b7 n1\u2032\nThus, our assertion is proved in case r\u2032 > 0\u2032.\nIf, however, r\u2032 < 0\u2032, then r\u2032 > 0\u2032; so, by what was proved above, r\u2032 =\n\u2212 \u2212\nf(x) = x 1\u2032 for some x R, and it easily follows that r\u2032 = ( x) 1\u2032 = f( x).\n\u00b7 \u2208 \u2212 \u00b7 \u2212 108 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nFinally, 0\u2032 = 0 1\u2032 = f(0), by definition. Thus, f is, indeed, onto R\u2032. This\ncompletes the p\u00b7 roof. (cid:3)\nObserve that the map f carries naturals and integers of E1 onto those of\nF. Thus, we have also proved that the set N of all natural numbers (in E1) is\nisomorphic, with respect to addition, multiplication, and order, to the set N\u2032\nof all naturals in any ordered field F, and similarly for the integers (J and J\u2032).\nBecause of the isomorphism established above, we may regard R and R\u2032 as\n\u201ccopies\u201d of one and the same set and not distinguish between them. Similarly\nfor N and N\u2032, or J and J\u2032. Thus, henceforth, we adopt the convention that\nR, N, and J are the same in each ordered field F, so that each F contains the\nrational numbers, R, themselves (R = R\u2032). In particular, 0 = 0\u2032, 1 = 1\u2032, and\nr 1\u2032 = r 1 = r for any rational r.\n\u00b7 \u00b7\nNext, let F be complete. Then one can define ra (a F) for any real r, in\n\u2208\nmuch the same manner as we defined ar in 12. Fixing first some r > 0 in E1\n\u00a7\nand a > 0\u2032 in F, let\nA = xa x R, 0 < x r ;\nra\n{ | \u2208 \u2264 }\ni.e., A is the set of all xa (defined as in Definition 2), with x R, 0 < x r.\nra\n\u2208 \u2264\nClearly, A = and, by Theorem 1(iv), A is right-bounded in F by any ya,\nra ra\n6 \u2205\nwith y R, y > r. Thus, by completeness, supA exists in F; so we define\nra\n\u2208\nra = supA (r > 0, a > 0\u2032). (3)\nra\nIf, in particular, r is rational then, by Theorem 1(iv), ra is the largest of\nall xa in A ; so ra (as in Definition 2) equals supA = maxA . Thus, in\nra ra ra\nthe rational case, our new definition of ra agrees with Definition 2. Finally, if\nr < 0, we put ra = ( r)a, and if a < 0\u2032, we define ra = [r( a)]. Thus, ra\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nis defined for all r E1 and all a F.\n\u2208 \u2208\nIt is easy to verify that Theorem 1 remains valid for arbitrary real r and s\n(provided F is complete); cf. Problems 2\u20134 below. We now have the following.\nTheorem 3. Any complete ordered field F is isomorphic with E1.\nProof. As before, we define f:E1 F by setting\n\u2192\nf(r) = r 1\u2032 for r E1.\n\u00b7 \u2208\nExactly as in Theorem 2, it follows that f preserves the operations and the\norder and is one-to-one. Only the fact that f is onto F requires a different\nproof.\nGiven any q F, we have to find an r E1 such that q = f(r) = r 1\u2032.\n\u2208 \u2208 \u00b7\nFirst let q > 0\u2032, and let\nQ\u2032 = x R\u2032 0 < x q ;\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 } \u2217 14. Isomorphism of Complete Ordered Fields 109\n\u00a7\ni.e., Q\u2032 consists of all rational x such that 0 < x q in F. Clearly, q is an upper\n\u2264\nbound of Q\u2032. Moreover, there is no smaller upper bound; for if p < q then, by\nthe density of rationals in the complete field F, there is x R\u2032 with p < x < q\n\u2208\n(x > 0), so that x Q\u2032 and x > p, and hence p is not an upper bound of Q\u2032.\n\u2208\nThus q = supQ\u2032. It also follows that Q\u2032 has rational upper bounds (take any\nrational y > q).\nSinceR\u2032 = R, wemayalsoregardQ\u2032 asasetofrationalsin E1, withrational\nupper bounds in E1. Thus Q\u2032 also has a supremum in E1; call it r. Let us\ndenote Q\u2032 by Q when it is regarded as a subset of E1.2 Thus\nQ = x R 0 < x r in E1,\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 }\nwhile\nQ\u2032 = x R\u2032 0\u2032 < x q in F.\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 }\nMore precisely, the sets Q and Q\u2032 correspond to each other under the isomor-\nphism\nx x 1\u2032.\n\u2194 \u00b7\nThus Q\u2032 is exactly the set of all elements in F of the form\nx 1\u2032 (x R, 0 < x r).\n\u00b7 \u2208 \u2264\nIn other words, Q\u2032 = A with a = 1\u2032, and\nra\nq = supQ\u2032 = supA = r 1\u2032 = f(r);\nra\n\u00b7\ni.e., q has the form f(r) for some r E1, as required. This proves our assertion\n\u2208\nin case q > 0\u2032.\nOn the other hand, if q < 0\u2032, then q > 0\u2032 and hence, by what was proved\n\u2212\nabove, q = f(s) for some s E1. Hence, by definition, f( s) = q; so our\n\u2212 \u2208 \u2212\nassertion is true in the negative case as well.\nFinally, by definition, 0\u2032 = f(0). Thus every element of F has the form f(r),\nr E1, and so f is indeed onto F. This completes the proof.

In the problems of 7 in Chapter 1, we sketched a method of constructing\n\u00a7\nintegers from naturals, and rationals from integers. Now we shall show how\nreals can be constructed from rationals. More generally, we shall show how\nan Archimedean field R can be extended to a complete one, and consider a 112 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nsimilar problem for ordered sets in general.1 This can be done by using so-\ncalled Dedekind cuts (Richard Dedekind, 1831\u20131916). We define them now for\nany ordered set R.\nDefinition 1.\nA Dedekind cut (briefly, cut) in an ordered set R is a pair (A,B) of\nnonempty subsets of R such that A is exactly the set of all lower bounds\nof B, and B is the set of all upper bounds of A, in R.\nA cut (A,B) is called a gap (in R) iff A B = .\n\u2229 \u2205\nIf (A,B) is not a gap, i.e., A B = , then A B consists of a single element;\n\u2229 6 \u2205 \u2229\nfor, by the definition of (A,B), any element p A B is an upper bound of A\n\u2208 \u2229\n(since p B) and hence p = maxA (for p A); similarly, p = minB. Thus,\n\u2208 \u2208\nby the uniqueness of maxA and minB,\np = maxA = minB is unique.\nFrom Definition 1, it also follows that\ny x A = y A; and y x B = y B.\n\u2264 \u2208 \u21d2 \u2208 \u2265 \u2208 \u21d2 \u2208\n(Why?) In the examples below, R is the set of all rationals.\nExamples.\n(1) Let p R, let\n\u2208\nA = x R x p , B = x R x p .\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 } { \u2208 | \u2265 }\nThis yields a cut (A,B); it is not a gap, for maxA = minB = p A B.\n\u2208 \u2229\n(2) Let\nA = x R x 0 or x2 < 2 , B = x R x > 0 and x2 > 2 .\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 } { \u2208 | }\nThen (A,B) is a cut. (Verify!) It is a gap since A B = . Also, maxA\n\u2229 \u2205\nand minB do not exist in R (cf. 11, Problem 8).\n\u00a7\nThus, we see that there are cuts of both kinds in R: gaps and nongaps.\nTheorem 1. For any cut (A,B) in an ordered set R, we have R = A B.\n\u222a\nIndeed, by Definition 1,\nA R and B R,\n\u2286 \u2286\nwhence A B R. Conversely, if x R and, say, x / A, then x is not a lower\n\u222a \u2286 \u2208 \u2208\nbound of B; i.e.,\nx > y for some y B.\n\u2208\n1We recall from 2 that an ordered set is a set in which a transitive and trichotomic\n\u00a7\nrelation\u201c<\u201dis defined.

We leave to the reader the proof that A A\u2032 is equivalent\nto\u2282 B B\u2032. (cid:3) \u2282\n\u2283\nWe shall now show that any ordered set R can be made complete by adding\nto it new elements, so as to \u201cfill\u201d its gaps. The nature of these elements may\nbe arbitrary; it is only required that they be different from the original (\u201cold\u201d)\nelements of R. Thus, for each gap (A,B) in R, we introduce a new element p\nin such a manner that different elements p correspond to different gaps (A,B);\nwe shall say that this p is determined by the corresponding gap (A,B), and\nconversely.\nIf (A,B) is not a gap then, as was shown above, there is in R an element\np = maxA = minB; in this case, too, we shall say that p is determined by the\ncut (A,B). Thus each cut (A,B) in R determines a certain element p that is\n\u201cnew\u201d or \u201cold\u201d according as (A,B) is, or is not, a gap.3 The set consisting of\nthe \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d elements together is called the completion of R, denoted\nR. By what was said above, there is a one-to-one correspondence between all\nelements of R and all cuts in R; the \u201cnew\u201d elements correspond to gaps in R.\nFor brevity, we write \u201cp (A,B)\u201d to mean that p is determined by (A,B).\n\u2261\nDefinition 2.\nFor any elements p (A,B) and q (A\u2032,B\u2032) in R, we write\n\u2261 \u2261\np < q iff A A\u2032, and p q iff A A\u2032.\n\u2282 \u2264 \u2286\nSimilarly for p > q and p q.\n\u2265\n2A is a proper subset of A\u2032 because r A\u2032 , while r / A, by assumption.\n\u2208 \u2208\n3p is said to be \u201cold\u201d if p R and \u201cnew\u201d if p / R.\n\u2208 \u2208 114 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nThe relation \u201c<\u201d so defined is trichotomic on R by Theorem 2. It is also\ntransitive (for so is ). Thus, it makes R an ordered set. Moreover, it agrees\n\u2282\nwith the original ordering of R if p, q R. Indeed, in this case (A,B) and\n\u2208\n(A\u2032,B\u2032) are not gaps, and so\nA = x R x p , A\u2032 = x R x q .\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 } { \u2208 | \u2264 }\nHence it easily follows (by Corollary 3 of 9) that A A\u2032 iff p q, and A A\u2032\n\u00a7 \u2286 \u2264 \u2282\niff p < q, under the original meaning of \u201cp < q\u201din R. (Verify!)\nTheorem 3. For any p (A,B) in R,\n\u2261\np = supA = infB.\nIf, further, p < q in R, there always are x,y R such that\n\u2208\np x < y q.\n\u2264 \u2264\nProof. All this is trivial if p R, i.e., if (A,B) is not a gap. Thus, we assume\n\u2208\nA B = , i.e., p is a \u201cnew\u201d element.\n\u2229 \u2205\nFirst we show that p is an upper bound of A. Take any element r A. As\n\u2208\nA R, r R; sor isdeterminedbya cut(A\u2032\u2032,B\u2032\u2032) (nogap!), with r = maxA\u2032\u2032.\n\u2282 \u2208\nHence,\n( x A\u2032\u2032) x r A,\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2264 \u2208\nimplying\n( x A\u2032\u2032) x A.\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2208\nThus, A\u2032\u2032 A, i.e., r p (by Definition 2). As this holds for any r A, p is\n\u2286 \u2264 \u2208\nindeed an upper bound of A. Similarly it is shown that p is a lower bound of\nB. We shall briefly say that p \u201cbounds\u201d A and B.\nAs the next step, let p < q (A\u2032,B\u2032). Then, by definition, A A\u2032; so we\n\u2261 \u2282\ncan find some y A\u2032 A. As y / A, we have y B; so, by what was proved\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2208 \u2208\nabove, p y q (for q bounds A\u2032, and y A\u2032). Moreover, as (A,B) is a gap,\n\u2264 \u2264 \u2208\nB has no minimum in R; thus, B must also contain some x < y, so that\np x < y q.\n\u2264 \u2264\nThis proves the second clause of the theorem. It also shows that no q > p\ncan be a lower bound of B (for it exceeds some x B). Thus, p is the greatest\nlower bound of B, i.e., p = infB. Similarly for p =\u2208 supA. (cid:3)\nNote 1 It follows that if a set M R has an upper (lower) bound q in R,\n\u2286\nthen M must also have such a bound in R. For example, if q (A\u2032,B\u2032) is an\n\u2261\nupper bound, then ( b B\u2032) q b; so b is another bound of M, and b R.\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2264 \u2208\nTheorem 4. The completion R of any ordered set R is a complete ordered set.\n(This justifies the name \u201ccompletion\u201d.) \u2217 15. Dedekind Cuts. Construction of E1 115\n\u00a7\nProof. The fact that R is an ordered set was established above. We only have\nto show that any nonempty right-bounded subset M of R has a supremum in\nR.\nNow, by Note 1, such an M has upper bounds belonging to R. Let B =\n6 \u2205\nbe the set of all such upper bounds on M, so that B R. In turn, let A\n\u2286\nbe the set of all lower bounds of B in R. (They exist, by Note 1, for B has\nleft bounds in M.) As is easily seen, (A,B) is a cut in R; so it determines an\nelement p (A,B). We shall show that p = supM.\n\u2261\nIndeed, by Theorem 3, p = infB; so p is not less than any lower bound of\nB, e.g., any m M. Thus ( m M) m p; i.e., p is an upper bound of M.\n\u2208 \u2200 \u2208 \u2264\nNow, seeking a contradiction, suppose there is a smaller upper bound r, r < p.\nThen, again by Theorem 3, r x < p for some x R. Hence, x too is an\n\u2264 \u2208\nupper bound of M, and since x R, it must belong to B, by the definition of\n\u2208\nB. But this is impossible since x < p = infB. This contradiction shows that p\nis the least upper bound of M, p = supM. (cid:3)\nII. Thus far we have only assumed that R is an ordered set. Now suppose that\nit is an ordered field. Then we not only can construct the complete ordered set\nR as above but also define operations in it, as follows.\nDefinition 3.\nLet R be an ordered field and let R be as above. Assuming that p,q R,\n\u2208\np (A,B), and q (A\u2032,B\u2032), we have the following:\n\u2261 \u2261\n(i) We define\np+q = inf(B +B\u2032),\nwhere B +B\u2032 is the set of all sums x+y, with x B and y B\u2032.\n\u2208 \u2208\n(These sums are defined in R, since B R and B\u2032 R.)\n\u2282 \u2282\n(ii) We define\np = inf( A),\n\u2212 \u223c\nwhere A is the set of all additive inverses x of elements x A\n\u223c \u2212 \u2208\n(similarly for B).\n\u223c\nNote that B is exactly the set of all lower bounds of A in\n\u223c \u223c\nR, and, conversely, A consists of all upper bounds of B. Thus\n\u223c \u223c\n( B, A) is a cut. By Theorem 3, the element determined by\n\u223c \u223c\n( B, A) equals inf( A), i.e., p. Thus p ( B, A).\n\u223c \u223c \u223c \u2212 \u2212 \u2261 \u223c \u223c\n(iii) If p > q and q > 0, we define\npq = inf(BB\u2032),\nwhere BB\u2032 is the set of all products xy, with x B, y B\u2032.\n\u2208 \u2208\nWe also put p 0 = 0 p = 0. In case p < 0, q < 0, we put\n\u00b7 \u00b7\npq = ( p)( q).\n\u2212 \u2212 116 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nIf p < 0 < q, we define pq = (( p)q), and if q < 0 < p, then\n\u2212 \u2212\npq = (p( q)),\n\u2212 \u2212\nso as to preserve the rule of signs. This reduces everything to the\npositive case; for if p < 0, then p > 0, as easily follows from\n\u2212\npart (ii) of the definition.\n(iv) If p > 0, we define\np\u22121 = inf(A\u22121),\nwhere A\u22121 is the set of all reciprocals of positive elements x A.\n\u2208\n(Such elements exist if p > 0; why?) Finally, if p < 0, we put\np\u22121 = ( p)\u22121.\n\u2212 \u2212\nObserve that all the infima required above exist in R because R is complete\n(by Theorem 4) and all sets involved are left-bounded. For, by Definition 1, B\nand B\u2032 have lower bounds r A and r A\u2032, respectively. Thus\n\u2208 \u2208\n( x B) ( y B\u2032) r x, r\u2032 y.\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2200 \u2208 \u2264 \u2264\nAs R is a field and x, y, r, r\u2032 R, we may add the inequalities and obtain\n\u2208\nr+r\u2032 x+y for all x+y in B +B\u2032;\n\u2264\nso r+r\u2032 is a lower bound of B +B\u2032.\nAlso, as A is right-bounded by some s B, A is left-bounded by s.\n\u2208 \u2212 \u2212\nAll this is still simpler in parts (iii) and (iv); for the assumption p > 0,\nq > 0 implies that B and B\u2032 consist of positive elements only (why?); so 0 is a\nlower bound of BB\u2032 in (iii), and similarly in (iv). Thus, indeed, all the required\ninfima are well-defined elements of R; hence so are p+q and pq. This proves\nthe closure laws in R.\nFinally note that if p,q R, then our definition of p+q and pq agrees with\n\u2208\nthe original meaning of p+q and pq in the field R. For, by Theorem 3, if\np = infB and q = infB\u2032,\nthen\np+q = inf(B +B\u2032) and pq = inf(BB\u2032)\nin R (cf. Problems 8 and 9 of 9). We can now prove our main result.\n\u00a7\nTheorem 5. With operations and inequalities (<) defined as above, the com-\npletion of an Archimedean field R is a complete ordered field.\nProof. Closure laws, trichotomy, transitivity, and completeness have already\nbeen verified above. The easy verification of Axioms II\u2013IV is sketched in Prob-\nlems 9\u201312 below. It remains to verify V, VI, and IX. \u2217 15. Dedekind Cuts. Construction of E1 117\n\u00a7\nAxiom V(a). Givenanelementp (A,B)inR,wemustshowthatp+( p) =\n\u2261 \u2212\n0, where p ( B, A) by Definition 3(ii). This amounts to proving that\n\u2212 \u2261 \u223c \u223c\n0 = inf[B +( A)], where\n\u223c\nB +( A) = y x y B, x A ,\n\u223c { \u2212 | \u2208 \u2208 }\nby Definition 3(i).\nNow, as (A,B) is a cut, we have\n( x A) ( y B) y x,\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2200 \u2208 \u2265\ni.e., y x 0. Thus, 0 is a lower bound of the set B + ( A), and we must\n\u2212 \u2265 \u223c\nonly show that 0 is the greatest lower bound.\nSeeking a contradiction, suppose there is a larger lower bound, r > 0. Then,\nfixing any x A, we have\n\u2208\n( y B) r y x\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2264 \u2212\nsince r is a lower bound of all such y x. Thus\n\u2212\n( y B) y r +x,\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2265\ni.e., r +x is a lower bound of B, and hence r +x A, by the definition of a\n\u2208\ncut. We see that\n( x A) r +x A.\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2208\nAs this applies to any x A, we may replace x by r + x, and thus obtain\n\u2208\nr +(r +x) = 2r +x A. Repeating this process, we obtain\n\u2208\nnr+x A, n = 1,2,...\n\u2208\nfor any x A; hence nr +x y for y B (for each y B is an upper bound\n\u2208 \u2264 \u2208 \u2208\nof A). Thus, fixing x A and y B, we get\n\u2208 \u2208\nnr y x, n = 1, 2, ...\n\u2264 \u2212\ncontrary to the assumed Archimedean property of R. This contradiction shows\nthat, indeed, B +( A) has no lower bounds > 0, and completes the proof.\n\u223c\nAxiom V(b) is proved quite analogously in case p > 0. One only has to\nreplace everywhere addition and subtraction by multiplication and division.\nAccordingly,\n0, p, B +( A), y x, r+x, and nr\n\u2212 \u223c \u2212\nare replaced, respectively, by\ny\n1, p\u22121, BA\u22121, , rx, and rn,\nx\nbut essentially the argument is the same. Note that the binomial expansion\nyields\nrn = (1+a)n = 1+na+ > na\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 118 Chapter 2. The Real Number System\nif we put r = 1+a (using the fact that r > 1 here). Thus, by the Archimedean\nproperty\ny\nrn > na >\nx\nfor large n, and this yields the required contradiction in the last part of the\nproof. The details are left to the reader. Finally, the proof for p < 0 easily\nfollows from the positive case, by the formula p\u22121 = ( p)\u22121. Thus Axiom V\n\u2212 \u2212\nis verified in full.\nAxiom VI. Let\np (A,B), q (A\u2032,B\u2032), r (A\u2032\u2032,B\u2032\u2032).\n\u2261 \u2261 \u2261\nWe must show that (p+q)r = pr +qr.\nAssume first that p, q, r > 0. Then it easily follows that\n(p+q)r = inf[(B +B\u2032)B\u2032\u2032] and pr +qr = inf(BB\u2032\u2032 +B\u2032B\u2032\u2032);\ncf. Problem 10(c). Thus all reduces to proving that\n(B +B\u2032)B\u2032\u2032 = BB\u2032\u2032 +B\u2032B\u2032\u2032.\nBut, by definition, the elements of (B +B\u2032)B\u2032\u2032 have the form (b+b\u2032)b\u2032\u2032, and\nthose of BB\u2032\u2032 +B\u2032B\u2032\u2032 have the form bb\u2032\u2032 +b\u2032b\u2032\u2032 (b B, b\u2032 B\u2032, b\u2032\u2032 B\u2032\u2032, all in\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208\nR). Thus, by the distributive law for R (a field, by assumption),\n(b+b\u2032)b\u2032\u2032 = bb\u2032\u2032 +b\u2032b\u2032\u2032,\nand so the sets (B+B\u2032)B\u2032\u2032 and BB\u2032\u2032+B\u2032B\u2032\u2032 coincide. This settles the case p,\nq, r > 0.\nMoreover, if p > q > 0 and r > 0, we also have\n(p q)r +qr = [(p q)+q]r,\n\u2212 \u2212\nby what was proved above (replacing p by p q). Hence (p q)r = pr qr.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nThis holds also if q > p > 0, since\n(p q)r = [(q p)r] = (qr pr) = pr qr.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nThus\n(p q)r = pr qr\n\u00b1 \u00b1\nfor p, q, r > 0. Now also the other cases can be handled. For example, if\np > 0 > q and r > 0, then q > 0 and\n\u2212\n(p+q)r = [p ( q)]r = pr ( q)r = pr +qr.\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2217 15. Dedekind Cuts.

We\n\u2261 \u2261 \u2261\nmust show that\np+r > q +r.\nNow, by Definition 2 and Theorem 2, p > q implies A A\u2032 and B\u2032 B;\n\u2283 \u2283\nhence\nB\u2032 +B\u2032\u2032 B +B\u2032\u2032.\n\u2287\n(Verify!) Thus, by Corollary 3 in 9,\n\u00a7\ninf(B +B\u2032\u2032) inf(B\u2032 +B\u2032\u2032),\n\u2265\ni.e., p + r q + r. Equality is excluded here, for p + r = q + r would imply\n\u2265\np = q (by Axioms III\u2013V, which we assume as proved already for R), and this\nis contrary to p > q. Thus p+r > q +r, as claimed.\nAxiom IX(b) is proved similarly for p, q > 0 and is obvious if p = 0 or q = 0.\nIn the general case (with r > 0, always), p > q implies p q > 0, whence\n\u2212\n(p q)r > 0 r = 0,\n\u2212 \u00b7\ni.e., pr > qr, by distributivity (Axiom VI). (cid:3)\nThus the theorem is proved. In particular, we can apply it to the field R of\nall rational numbers (for R is Archimedean).4 By Theorem 5, the completion\nR of R satisfies all axioms valid for real numbers, and so we may simply define\nE1 to be R. In this case, the \u201cold\u201d elements of R are the rationals, and hence\nthe \u201cnew\u201d ones are the irrationals.\nProblems on Dedekind Cuts\n1.

(g.l.b.) if A is bounded above\n6 \u2205\n(below, respectively), but not otherwise. In order to avoid this inconvenient\nrestriction, we now add to E1 two new objects of arbitrary nature (\u201ctwo peb-\nbles\u201d) and call them \u201cminus infinity\u201d ( ) and \u201cplus infinity\u201d(+ ), with the\n\u2212\u221e \u221e\nconvention that < + and < x < + for all x E1.\n\u2212\u221e \u221e \u2212\u221e \u221e \u2208\nIt is readily seen that, with this convention, the laws of trichotomy and\ntransitivity (Axioms VII and VIII) remain valid. The set consisting of all reals\nand the two infinities is called the extended real number system. We denote\nit by E\u2217 and call its elements extended real numbers. The ordinary reals are\nalso called finite numbers, while are the only two infinite elements of E\u2217.\n\u00b1\u221e\n(Caution: They are not real numbers. E\u2217 is not a field.)\nAt this stage we do not define any operations involving (though this\n\u00b1\u221e\ncan be done). However, the notions of upper and lower bound, maximum,\nminimum, supremum, and infimum are defined in E\u2217 exactly as in E1. In\nparticular, = minE\u2217 and + = maxE\u2217. Thus, in E\u2217, all sets are\n\u2212\u221e \u221e\nbounded by and + .1\n\u2212\u221e \u221e\nIt follows that in E\u2217 every set A = has a l.u.b. and a g.l.b. For if A has\n6 \u2205\nno upper bound in E1, it still has the upper bound + in E\u2217, which in this\n\u221e\ncase is the unique (hence also the least) upper bound; thus supA = + .2 It\n\u221e\nis also customary to define sup = and inf = + (this is the only case\n\u2205 \u2212\u221e \u2205 \u221e\nwhere supA < infA). All properties of l.u.b. and g.l.b. stated in 9 remain\n\u00a7\nvalid in E\u2217, with the same proof.

Because of this repre-\nsentation, such pairs are often called\n\u201cpoints\u201d of the Cartesian plane (each\npair being regarded as one \u201cpoint\u201d).\nThe set of all such pairs is, by defini-\ntion, the Cartesian product (or cross (0,0) x X\nproduct)E1 E1, alsobrieflydenoted Figure 12\n\u00d7\nby E2. An ordered pair (x, y) E2\n\u2208\ncan also be graphically represented as a directed line segment (\u201cvector\u201d) pass-\ning from the origin (0, 0) to (x, y) (see Figure 12). Therefore, such pairs are\nalso called \u201cvectors\u201d in E2.\nQuite similarly, ordered triples (x, y, z) of real numbers are called \u201cpoints\u201d\nor \u201cvectors\u201d of the three-dimensional space E3 = E1 E1 E1. Nothing\n\u00d7 \u00d7\nprevents us also from considering the set En of all ordered n-tuples of real\nnumbers (with n fixed). Though in n dimensions there is no actual geometric\nrepresentation, it is convenient to use the geometric language in this case, too.\nThus every ordered n-tuple of real numbers\n(x , x , ..., x )\n1 2 n\nwill also be called a \u201cpoint\u201d or \u201cvector\u201d in En, and the single numbers\nx , x , ..., x\n1 2 n\nof which it is composed are called its coordinates or components. En itself is\ncalled n-dimensional Euclidean space, briefly, \u201cn-space\u201d. A point in En will 130 Chapter 3.

Thus we write\n~x = (x , x , ..., x ), u\u00af = (u , u , ..., u ), etc.;\n1 2 n 1 2 n\nthe notation x\u00af = (0, 1, 2, 4) means that x\u00af is a point (vector) in E4, with\n\u2212\ncoordinates 0, 1, 2, and 4 (in this order). In E2 and E3, we shall also\n\u2212\nsometimesuse x, y, z to denotethe coordinates; e.g.,~v = (x, y, z) E3, or u\u00af =\n\u2208\n(x,y) E2. It should be well noted that the term \u201cpoint\u201d or \u201cvector\u201d means\n\u2208\nthe n-tuple, and not its graphical representation (\u201cdot\u201d or \u201cline segment\u201d); a\ndrawing may not be used at all. The formula x\u00af En means that x\u00af is a point\n\u2208\nin En, i.e., an n-tuple, namely (x , x , ..., x ).\n1 2 n\nAs we know, two ordered n-tuples are equal only if the corresponding coor-\ndinates are the same. Thus two vectors (points) ~x and ~y in En are equal iff\nthey have the same corresponding components, i.e., if\nx = y , x = y , ..., x = y ,\n1 1 2 2 n n\nbut not if the components occur in different order; e.g., (4, 2, 1) = (2, 1, 4).\n6\nNote: One vector equation is equivalent to n coordinate equations.\nThe point whose coordinates are all 0 is called the origin or the zero-vector,\ndenoted by ~0 or \u00af0. Thus ~0 = (0, 0, ..., 0) (n times). The vector whose k-th\ncoordinate is 1 and whose remaining n 1 coordinates are 0 is called the k-th\n\u2212\nbasic unit vector, denoted by ~e ; there are exactly n such vectors, namely,\nk\n~e = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0), ~e = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), ..., ~e = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1).\n1 2 n\nIn E2, we often denote these vectors by~\u0131 and ~\uf6be; in E3, we denote them by~\u0131, ~\uf6be,\n~\nand k, respectively.\nThe term \u201cvector\u201d (rather than \u201cpoint\u201d) is preferably used when certain\noperations are involved, which we shall define next; single real numbers are\nthen called scalars. Note: No scalar can be equal to a vector in En (since\nthe latter is an n-tuple), except if n = 1 (i.e., if we consider E1 itself as our\n\u201cspace\u201d). Also note that the n components of a vector in En are scalars, not\nvectors. Sometimes we write \u22120\u2192x for a vector ~x (especially when we think of\n~x as represented by a directed line segment); \u22120\u2192x is often called the \u201cposition\nvector\u201d of the \u201cpoint\u201d x\u00af. In our theory, it is just another name for the vector\n(point) ~x itself.\nDefinition 1.\nGiven two vectors ~x = (x , x , ..., x ) and ~y = (y , y , ..., y ) in En,\n1 2 n 1 2 n\nwe define their sum and difference to be the vector whose coordinates\nare obtained by adding or subtracting, respectively, the corresponding 1.

The reader will note that this definition agrees with\nthe familiar geometric rule of constructing the sum of two vectors, in E2 or E3,\nas the diagonal of the parallelogram whose sides are these vectors, represented\nas directed line segments. Imitating the usual geometric terminology, we shall\nalso call ~x ~y the \u201cvector passing from the point ~y to the point ~x\u201d and denote\n\u2212\nit also by \u2212y\u2192x.

Thus Theorem 2 shows that any vector\n~v En can be expressed, in a unique way, as a linear combination of the n\n\u2208\nbasic unit vectors ~e (the coefficients a being necessarily the components of\nk k\n~v).\nNote 2. As we have noted, in E3 the basic unit vectors are often denoted\n~\nby~\u0131, ~\uf6be, k and the coordinates by x, y, z. Then, by Theorem 2,\n~\n~v = (x, y, z) = x~\u0131+y~\uf6be+zk,\nand this representation of ~v is unique. Thus the right side sum may be treated\nas a standard notation for a vector, instead of (x, y, z). It should, however, be\nwell-noted that this sum represents an ordered triple, namely, (x, y, z).\nNote 3. From our definitions and Theorem 1, the n-space En has emerged\nas a set of elements (called \u201cvectors\u201d or \u201cpoints\u201d) for which two operations are\ndefined, namely, addition of vectors and multiplication of a vector by a scalar\n(real number). There also are many other sets (not necessarily sets of n-tuples)\nfor which two such operations are defined in some manner. Any set with two\nsuch operations is called a real vector space if these operations obey all laws\nspecified in Theorem 1. E1 is called its field of scalars. Thus En is a real\nvector space under the operations defined above. 134 Chapter 3. The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nCaution: We shall not define any inequalities (<) for vectors in En. Thus,\nexpressions like x\u00af < y\u00af will not be used and should be carefully avoided except\nif n = 1, i.e., if the \u201cvectors\u201d under consideration are simply real numbers\n(elements of E1).\nDespite the two operations defined in En, the n-space is not a field (except\nin the case of E1), mainly because the multiplication of a vector by a vector\nis not defined in En. Scalar multiples are not products of two vectors, even\nthough some of their properties resemble those of products of real numbers.\nThere also is no such thing as a \u201cneutral element of vector multiplication\u201d\n(though there is a neutral element of vector addition, namely, ~0). In the next\nsection we shall define certain products (\u201cinner products\u201d) of vectors; but even\nso, En will not become a field, because these products do not satisfy the field\naxioms in full. Only for E2 shall we later define a vector multiplication that\nwill satisfy these axioms, and so E2 will become a field.\nNote 4. As we have seen in Theorem 2, sometimes we have to num-\nber several vectors by affixing appropriate subscripts; e.g., ~e , ~e , ..., ~e or\n1 2 n\n~x , ~x , ..., ~x .

The notions of angle and unit vector were defined by using inner\nproducts and absolute values. Thus one can define them, in exactly the same\nmanner, notonly in En but also in other vector spaces(see Note 3, 1) in which\n\u00a7\ninner products (satisfying Theorem 1 of 2) are defined. Such vector spaces are\n\u00a7\ncalled Euclidean. For more details, see 9.\n\u00a7\n\u00a74. Lines and Line Segments\nThe term \u201cline\u201d shall always mean a line extending indefinitely (never a line\nsegment, which is only a part of a line).\nx\u00af\nTo obtain all points of a straight\nline in E2 or E3, we take a \u201cvector\u201d\n\u00afb\n~u = \u2212a\u2192b (joining two given points a\u00af\n~u\n\u00af\nand b on the line) and then, so to say, a\u00af\n\u201cstretch\u201d it indefinitely in both direc-\ntions, i.e., multiply ~u by all possible\nscalarst E1 (positive, negative, and\n\u2208\n0).

Here the vector \u2212a\u2192x is a\nscalar multiple of \u2212a\u2192b = ~u; specifically, \u2212a\u2192x = t~u, where\n\u2212a\u2192x \u2212a\u2192x\nt = | | or t = | |\n~u \u2212 ~u\n| | | |\naccordingto whetherthevectors\u2212a\u2192x and~u have thesameoroppositedirections.\nThus we have\nx\u00af = \u22120\u2192x = \u22120\u2192a +\u2212a\u2192x = a\u00af+t~u.\nConversely, every point of that form (for any t E1) lies on the line ab.

The formula\nx\u00af = a\u00af + t~u (respectively, x\u00af =\u2212 a\u00af + t(\u00af b a\u00af)) is called the equation of the line\n\u2212\n(more precisely, its parametric equation). In the first case, we say that the line\nis given by a point a\u00af and a direction ~u; in the second case, it is determined\nby two of its points, a\u00af and \u00af b. In terms of the coordinates of x\u00af, a\u00af and ~u (or \u00af b),\nthe parametric equation is equivalent to n simultaneous equations (called the\nparametric coordinate equations of the line):\nx = a +tu = a +t(b a ), k = 1,2,...,n. (2)\nk k k k k k\n\u2212\nIt is a great advantage of the vector notation that one vector equation replaces\nn coordinate equations.\nNow, since the vector ~u (used to form the line) is anyway being multiplied\nby arbitrary scalars t, it is clear that the line (1) will not gain or lose any of\nits points if ~u is replaced by some scalar multiple c~u (c = 0). In particular,\n6\nwe may replace ~u by its unit ~u/ ~u (taking c = 1/ ~u ). Thus we may always\n| | | |\nassume (if desirable) that ~u is a unit vector itself. In this case the equation\nx\u00af = a\u00af + t~u (and the equations (2)) are said to be normal. To normalize an\nequation of a line means to replace ~u by ~u/ ~u . Since c may also be negative,\n| |\nthe line (1) does not change if we replace ~u by ~u; thus the direction of a\n\u2212\nline is not uniquely determined: we always have two choices of the unit vector\n~u. If, however, a particular ~u is prescribed in advance, we speak of a directed\nline. The coordinates of the direction vector ~u (or any of its scalar multiples\nc~u) are called a set of n direction numbers for the line (1); of course, there are\ninfinitely many such sets corresponding to different values of c. In particular,\nthe direction cosines of ~u (i.e., the components of the unit vector ~u/ ~u ) are\n| |\ncalled a set of direction cosines of the line. (There are precisely two such sets,\nnamely the direction cosines of ~u and those of ~u.)\n\u2212\nIn addition to changing the vector ~u, we may also alter the parameter t.\nIndeed, since t is anyway supposed to take on all real values, nothing will\nchange if we replace it by some other variable expression \u03b8 which likewise runs\nover all real values, e.g., by \u03b8 = 1 t. Thus, every line has infinitely many\n\u2212\nparametric equations, depending on the choice of the parameter. We can also\nentirelyeliminatetheparameterfromequations(2)byrewritingthemasfollows 4.

Fix a point a\u00af of\nthe plane and a vector ~u = \u2212a\u2192b perpendicular to the plane (imagine a pencil\nstanding vertically at a\u00af on the horizontal plane of the table). Then a point x\u00af\nlies on the plane iff ~u \u2212a\u2192x (the pencil ~u is perpendicular to the line ax drawn\n\u22a5\non the table). It is natural to accept this as a definition in En as well (here\n\u201cplanes\u201d are also called \u201chyperplanes\u201d).\nDefinition 1.\nBy a hyperplane (briefly, plane) through a given point a\u00af En, perpen-\n\u2208\ndicular to a fixed vector ~u =~0, we mean the set of all points x\u00af En such\n6 \u2208\nthat ~u is perpendicular to \u2212a\u2192x.

This shows that we may replace the normal vector ~u by any\nscalar multiple q~u (q = 0), without changing the hyperplane.

If, however, the direction is\nprescribed, we speak of a directed hyperplane.\nIf all but one coefficients u vanish, then ~u becomes a scalar multiple of the\nk\ncorresponding basic unit vector ~e ; the plane is then perpendicular to ~e , and\nk k\nwe say that it is \u201cperpendicular to the k-th axis\u201d.

We express this by saying that f preserves linear combi-\ni\nnations, or preserves vector addition and multiplication by scalars. Mappings\nwith that property turn out to be of great importance for the theory of vector\nspaces in general (cf. 1, Note 3). They are called linear maps (because they\n\u00a7\npreserve linear combinations).\nIn particular, for Euclidean spaces En and Er, we have the following.\nDefinition 2.\nA mapping f:En Er is said to be linear iff it preserves linear combi-\n\u2192\nnations, i.e., satisfies (4) and hence (5) (see above).

If such a vector u\u00af exists then, as was shown above, f satisfies (4) and\nhence is linear. Conversely, if f is linear, then f preserves linear combinations.\nNow, by Theorem 2 of 1, every x\u00af En is such a combination, namely,\n\u00a7 \u2208\nn\nx\u00af = x e\u00af .\nk k\nk=1\nX\nThus, by (5),\nn n\nf(x\u00af) = f x e\u00af = x f(e\u00af ), x\u00af En.\nn k k k\n\u2208\n(cid:18)k=1 (cid:19) k=1\nX X\nHere, since f is a map into E1, the function values f(e\u00af ) are in E1, i.e., cer-\nk\ntain real numbers. Then let f(e\u00af ) = u E1, k = 1,2,...,n, and set\nk k\n\u2208\nu\u00af = (u , ..., u ).

Thus u is the desired vector, and all is\nproved. (cid:3)\nNote 1. The vector u\u00af of Theorem 2 is unique.

The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nOur next theorem shows that hyperplanes are exactly all those sets in En\nwhose equations are of the form f(x\u00af) = c, where f is a linear functional not\nidentically 0 and c is a real constant. More precisely, we have the following\nresult.\nTheorem 3. A set A En is a hyperplane iff there is a linear functional\n\u2286\nf:En E1, f 0, and some c E1, such that\n\u2192 6\u2261 \u2208\nA = x\u00af En f(x\u00af) = c ,\n{ \u2208 | }\ni.e., A consists of exactly those points x\u00af En for which f(x\u00af) = c.\n\u2208\nProof. If A is a hyperplane, its general equation (2) may also be written\nas u\u00af x\u00af = c (since u\u00af x\u00af is, by definition, the left-hand side of (2)). Thus\n\u00b7 \u00b7\nA = x\u00af En u\u00af x\u00af = c . Setting f(x\u00af) = u\u00af x\u00af, we obtain a linear functional\n{ \u2208 | \u00b7 } \u00b7\nf:En E1, by Theorem 2. Then A = x\u00af En f(x\u00af) = c . Moreover, as\n\u2192 { \u2208 | }\nu\u00af = \u00af0 in (2), f is not 0 (Problem 9 of 4). Thus A is as stated in Theorem 3.\n6 \u2261 \u00a7\nConversely, if A = ~x En f(x\u00af) = c , with f a linear functional 0, then\n{ \u2208 | } 6\u2261\nagain Theorem 2 yields a vector u\u00af = \u00af0 such that\n6\nn\nf(x\u00af) = u\u00af x\u00af = u x\nk k\n\u00b7\nk=1\nfor all x\u00af En. Then we obtain X\n\u2208\nn\nA = x\u00af En f(x\u00af) = c = x\u00af En u x = c ,\nk k\n{ \u2208 | } \u2208 |\n(cid:26) k=1 (cid:27)\nX\nand this means that A is exactly the set of points satisfying equation (2), i.e., a\nhyperplane. Thus all is proved. (cid:3)\nNote 2. This theorem could be accepted as an alternative definition of a\nhyperplane. It has the advantage that it replaces the notion of dot products by\nthat of a linear functional, without any reference to \u201cangles\u201d or orthogonality\n(which are defined in Euclidean spaces only; cf. Note 4 in 3).\n\u00a7\nExamples.\n(1\u2032\u2032) Let a\u00af = (1, 2, 0, 3) and ~u = (1, 1, 1, 1) in E4.

Similarly, cross products of three line intervals\nyield rectangular parallelepipeds in E3. We may also consider cross products\nof n line intervals. This leads us to the following definition.\nDefinition 1.\nBy an interval in En, we mean the Cartesian product of any n intervals\nin E1 (some may be open, some closed or half-open, etc.).\n\u00af\nIn particular, given a\u00af = (a , ..., a ) and b = (b , ..., b ), with a b ,\n1 n 1 n k k\nk = 1,...,n, we define the open interval (a\u00af, \u00af b), the closed interval [a\u00af, \u00af b\u2264 ], the\nhalf-open interval (a\u00af, \u00af b], and the half-closed interval [a\u00af, \u00af b) as follows.

Similarly,\nk k\n\u00af\n[a\u00af, b] = [a , b ] [a , b ] [a , b ]\n1 1 2 2 n n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7\n= x\u00af En a x b , k = 1, 2, ..., n ;\nk k k\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 \u2264 }\n\u00af\n(a\u00af, b] = (a , b ] (a , b ] (a , b ]\n1 1 2 2 n n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7\n= x\u00af En a < x b , k = 1, 2, ..., n ;\nk k k\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 }\n\u00af\n[a\u00af, b) = [a , b ) [a , b ) [a , b )\n1 1 2 2 n n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7\n= x\u00af En a x < b , k = 1, 2, ..., n .\nk k k\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 }\nWhile in E1 there are only these four types of intervals, in En we can\nform many more kinds of them by cross-multiplying different (mixed) kinds of\nline intervals. In all cases, the points a\u00af and \u00af b are called the endpoints of the\ninterval. If a = b for some k, the interval is called degenerate. We often\nk k\ndenote intervals by single capitals; e.g., A = (a\u00af, \u00af b).\n\u00af\nNote 1. A point x\u00af belongs to (a\u00af, b) only if the inequalities a < x < b\nk k k\nhold simultaneously for k = 1, 2, ..., n. This is impossible if a = b for\nk k\nsome k. Thus a degenerate open interval is always empty. Similarly for other\nnonclosed intervals. A closed interval contains at least its endpoints a\u00af, \u00af b.\nDefinition 2.\nIf a\u00af and\u00af b are the endpointsof an interval A in En, their distance\u03c1(a\u00af,\u00af b) =\n\u00af b a\u00af is called the diagonal dA of A; the n differences b a = \u2113 are\nk k k\n| \u2212 | \u2212\ncalled its n edgelengths; their product\nn n\n\u2113 = (b a )\nk k k\n\u2212\nk=1 k=1\nY Y 166 Chapter 3.

To \u201cimitate\u201d\nthis in En, we use hyperplanes (see 5). A hyperplane perpendicular to the\n\u00a7\nk-th axis (i.e., to ~e ) can be defined as the set of all those points x\u00af in En\nk\nwhose k-th coordinate equals some fixed number c (the other coordinates may\nbe arbitrary). Briefly, we call it \u201cthe hyperplane x = c\u201d. If a < c < b (a\u00af\nk k k\n\u00af\nand b being the endpoints of A), then A splits into two disjoint sets:\nP = x\u00af A x < c and Q = x\u00af A x c ,\nk k\n{ \u2208 | } { \u2208 | \u2265 }\nor\nP = x\u00af A x c and Q = x\u00af A x > c .\nk k\n{ \u2208 | \u2264 } { \u2208 | }\nWe shall now show that P and Q are indeed intervals, with vA = vP +vQ.\nTheorem 1. If an interval A En with endpoints a\u00af and \u00af b is split by a\n\u2282\nhyperplane x = c (a < c < b ), then the partition sets P and Q (as above)\nk k k\nare intervals, and one of them is closed if A is. In particular, if c = 1(a +b )\n2 k k\n(the plane bisects the k-th edge), then the k-th edgelength of P and Q equals\n1\u2113 = 1(b a ); the other edgelengths equal those of A.\n2 k 2 k \u2212 k\nMoreover, the volume of A is the sum of vP and vQ: vA = vP +vQ.\nProof. To fix ideas, let A be half-\nY\n\u00af\nopen, i.e., A = (a\u00af, b]; let a < c < b\n1 1 q\u00af \u00afb\n(i.e., we cut the first edge), and let b 2\nP = x\u00af A x c ,\n{ \u2208 | 1 \u2264 } P Q\nQ = x\u00af A x > c\n1\n{ \u2208 | } a\n2\n(i.e.,weincludethecrosssectionx = a\u00af p\u00af\n1\nc in P). Consider the points\n\u00af0 a c b\n1 1 X\np\u00af= (c, a , a , ..., a ) and\n2 3 n\nFigure 19\nq\u00af= (c, b , b , ..., b )\n2 3 n 7. Intervals in En 167\n\u00a7\n(see Figure 19), so that p = q = c, while p = a and q = b for k 2. To\n1 1 k k k k\n\u2265\nprove that P is an interval, we show that P = (a\u00af, q\u00af].\nIndeed, if some x\u00af is in P, then, by definition, x\u00af A and a < x c =\n1 1\n\u2208 \u2264\nq , and a < x b = q , k = 2, ..., n. Thus a < x q for all k,\n1 k k k k k k k\n\u2264 \u2264\ni.e., x (a, q]. Reversing steps, we also see that x\u00af (a, q] implies x\u00af P. Thus\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208 \u00af\nP (a\u00af,q\u00af] P, i.e., P = (a\u00af, q\u00af]. Quite similarly it is shown that Q = (p\u00af, b].\nTh\u2286 us P and\u2286 Q are indeed intervals. It is clear that if A is closed, i.e., A = [a\u00af, \u00af b],\nthe same proof yields P = [a\u00af, q\u00af] (so P is closed!). This proves the first part of\nthe theorem.\nNext, we compute the edgelengths of P and Q. For k 2, we have q = b\nk k\n\u2265\nand p = a . Thus the edgelengths of P = (a\u00af, q\u00af] are q a = b a , i.e., the\nk k k k k k\n\u2212 \u2212\nsame as those of A (for k 2); similarly for Q. On the other hand, the first\n\u2265\nedgelength of P is q a = c a and that of Q is b p = b c. If\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nc = 1(a +b ), both expressions simplify to 1(b a ). This proves the second\n2 1 1 2 1 \u2212 1\npart of the theorem.\nFinally, the formula vA = vP +vQ is proved by computing vA and vQ; we\nleave the details to the reader. Thus the theorem is proved. (cid:3)\nNote that, by including the cross section x = c in Q (instead of P), we\n1\ncould make Q closed (if A itself is). Thus the choice is ours; but we cannot\nmake both P and Q closed. (Why?) Also note that, by what was shown above,\na half-open interval (a, b] can be split into two half-open intervals P and Q;\nsimilarly for half-closed intervals.\nNext, we consider partitions into\nY\nmore than two subintervals. One im-\nportant case is where we draw n hy- \u00afb\nperplanes, each bisecting one of the\nedges of an interval A and perpendic-\nular to the corresponding axis. The\nfirst hyperplane bisects the first edge,\na\u00af\nleaving the others unchanged (as was\nshown in Theorem 1). The resulting\n\u00af0\nX\ntwo subintervals P and Q then are\nFigure 20\nboth cut (each into two parts) by the\nsecond hyperplane, which bisects the second edge in A, P, and Q. Thus, we get\nfour disjoint intervals (see Figure 20 for E2). The third hyperplane bisects the\nthird edge in each of them. This yields eight subintervals. Thus each successive\nhyperplane doubles the number of the subintervals. After all n steps, we thus\nobtain 2n intervals, with all edges bisected, so that every edgelength in each of\nthe 2n subintervals equals 1 of the corresponding edgelength of A. Moreover,\n2\nif A is closed then, as previously noted, we can make any one of them (but\nonly one) closed, by properly manipulating the cross sections at each of the n\nsteps. This argument yields the following result. 168 Chapter 3. The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nTheorem 2. By drawing n hyperplanes bisecting the edges of an interval A\n\u2282\nEn, one can split A into 2n disjoint subintervals whose edgelengths equal one\nhalf of the corresponding edgelengths of A and whose diagonals equal 1dA. Any\n2\none (but only one) of the subintervals can be made closed if A is closed.\nIndeed, all this was proved except the statement about the diagonals. But\n\u00af\nif a\u00af and b are the endpoints of A, then clearly\nn n\ndA = \u00af b a\u00af = (b a )2 = \u21132.\n| \u2212 | k \u2212 k k\ns s\nk=1 k=1\nX X\nSince the edgelengths of the subintervals are 1\u2113 , their diagonals, by the\n2 k\nsame formula, equal\nn n\n1 1 1\n\u21132 = \u21132 = dA,\n4 k 2 k 2\ns s\nk=1 k=1\nX X\nas claimed.\nOur next theorem states an important property of the volume, called its\nadditivity.

Complex Numbers\nAs we have already noted, En is not a field, because of the lack of a vector\nmultiplication that would satisfy the field axioms. Now we shall define such a\nmultiplication, but only for E2. Thus E2 will become a field which we shall\ncall the complex field, denoted C.\nIn this connection, it will be convenient to introduce some notational and\nterminological changes. Points of E2, when regarded as elements of the field C,\nwill be called complex numbers (each being an ordered pair of real numbers).\nWe shall denote them by lower case letters (preferably z), without a bar or an\narrow; e.g., z = (x,y) denotes a complex number with coordinates x and y.\nWe shall preferably write (x,y) instead of (x ,x ). The coordinates x and y of\n1 2\nz are also called the real and imaginary parts of z, respectively. 8. Complex Numbers 173\n\u00a7\nIf z = (x,y), then z will denote\nY z\nthe complex number (x, y), called\n\u2212\nthe conjugate of z. Thus z has the\nsame real part as z, but its imaginary\npart is the additive inverse of that of 0 X\nz. Geometrically, the point z is sym-\nmetric to z with respect to the x-axis z\n(see Figure 22). Figure 22\nComplex numbers of the form (x,0), i.e., those with vanishing imaginary\npart, are called real points of C. For brevity, we shall simply write x for (x,0);\ne.g., 2 = (2,0). In particular, we write 1 for e\u00af = (1,0) and call it the real unit\n1\nin C. Points of the form (0,y), with vanishing real part, are called (purely)\nimaginary numbers. In particular, the unit vector e\u00af is such a number since\n2\ne\u00af = (0,1); we shall now denote it by i and call it the imaginary unit in C.\n2\nApart from these notational and terminological peculiarities, all our former\ndefinitions that were given for En remain valid in E2 = C. In particular, this\napplies to the definition of the sum and difference,\n(x,y) (x\u2032,y\u2032) = (x x\u2032,y y\u2032),\n\u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1\nand that of the absolute value: If z = (x,y), then z = x2 +y2. Similarly,\n| |\nif z = (x,y) and z(x\u2032,y\u2032), then \u03c1(z,z\u2032) = (x x\u2032)2 +(y y\u2032)2. Hence, also,\n\u2212 p\u2212\nall previous theorems remain valid.\np\nWe now definethe newmultiplication in C. Thedefinitionmay seemstrange\nat first sight, but it makes a field out of E2, as will be seen.\nDefinition 1.\nThe product of two complex numbers (x,y) = z and (x\u2032,y\u2032) = z\u2032 is the\ncomplex number (xx\u2032 yy\u2032,xy\u2032 +yx\u2032), denoted (x,y)(x\u2032,y\u2032) or zz\u2032.\n\u2212\nTheorem 1. E2 = C is a field under addition and multiplication as defined\nabove, with the zero element 0 = (0,0) and unity 1 = (1,0).\nProof. We only must show that multiplication obeys the field axioms I\u2013VI (as\nfor addition, all is proved in Theorem 1 of 1).\n\u00a7\nAxiom I (closure law) is obvious from Definition 1: if z, z\u2032 are in C, so is\nzz\u2032. To prove commutativity, we take any two complex numbers, z = (x,y)\nand z\u2032 = (x\u2032,y\u2032), and verify that zz\u2032 = z\u2032z. Indeed, by definition,\nzz\u2032 = (xx\u2032 yy\u2032,xy\u2032 +yx\u2032), while z\u2032z = (x\u2032x y\u2032y,x\u2032y +y\u2032x);\n\u2212 \u2212\nbut the bracketed expressions coincide, by the commutative laws for real num-\nbers. Thus, indeed, zz\u2032 = z\u2032z. Associativity and distributivity are proved in a\nsimilar manner, and we leave it to the reader.\nNext, we show that 1 = (1,0) is the \u201cunity\u201d element required in Ax-\niom IV(b), i.e., that for any number z = (x,y) C, we have 1z = z. In\n\u2208 174 Chapter 3. The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nfact, by Definition 1,\n1z = (1,0)(x,y) = (1x 0y,1y +0x) = (x 0,y +0) = (x,y) = z\n\u2212 \u2212\n(here we have used the corresponding laws for reals).\nIt remains to establish Axiom V(b), i.e., to show that every complex number\nz = (x,y) = (0,0) has a multiplicative inverse z\u22121 such that zz\u22121 = 1. It turns\n6\nout that this inverse is obtained by setting\nx y\nz\u22121 = , \u2212 ,\nz 2 z 2\n(cid:16)| | | | (cid:17)\nwhere z 2 = x2 +y2. In fact, with z\u22121 so defined, we have\n| |\nx y x2 +y2 xy +yx\nzz\u22121 = (x,y) , \u2212 = , \u2212\nz 2 z 2 z 2 z 2\n(cid:16)| | | | (cid:17) (cid:16) | | | | (cid:17)\nx2 +y2\n= ,0 = (1,0) = 1.\nz 2\n(cid:16) | | (cid:17)\nThus, indeed, zz\u22121 = 1, as required, and all is proved. (cid:3)\nWe now obtain some immediate corollaries.\nCorollary 1. i2 = 1. In fact, by definition,\n\u2212\ni2 = (0,1)(0,1) = (0 0 1 1,0 1+1 0) = ( 1,0) = 1.\n\u00b7 \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 \u2212\nThus the complex field C has an element i = (0,1) whose square is 1 =\n\u2212\n( 1,0), whereas there is no such element in E1, by Corollary 3 in 4 of Chap-\n\u2212 \u00a7\nter 2. This is not a contradiction since that corollary was proved only for\nordered fields (it is based on Axioms VII\u2013IX). This only shows that C cannot\nbe ordered, so as to satisfy Axioms VII\u2013IX. Thus we shall define no inequalities\n(<) in C.\nFrom our definitions one easily obtains the following equations for \u201creal\npoints\u201d (x,0) and (x\u2032,0):\n(x,0)+(x\u2032,0) = (x+x\u2032,0) and (x,0) (x\u2032,0) = (xx\u2032,0).\n\u00b7\n(Verify!) Thus two \u201creal points\u201d in C are added (multiplied) by simply adding\n(multiplying) their real parts, xandx\u2032, whiletheimaginarypart,i.e.,0,remains\nunchanged, as an \u201conlooker\u201d only. Similarly for subtraction and division. In\nother words, when carrying out field operations on \u201creal points\u201d in C, we may\nsafely forget about the distinction between the real number x (x E1) and the\n\u2208\nreal point (x,0) in C. The real points in C behave exactly like real numbers.\nOne easily verifies that they form a field (called the real subfield of C), and we\nmay even order them exactly as we order their real parts, i.e., by setting\n(x,0) < (x\u2032,0) x < x\u2032.\n\u21d0\u21d2 8. Complex Numbers 175\n\u00a7\nThen the real points in C become an ordered field that, mathematically, is an\nexact copy of E1. Geometrically, it is the x-axis in the xy-plane representing\nC.\n(\u2217More precisely, one can describe this situation by using the notion of iso-\nmorphism defined in 14 of Chapter 2. The mapping x (x,0) is an isomor-\n\u00a7 \u2192\nphism of E1 onto the real subfield of C, since it preserves addition, multiplica-\ntion, and order. (Verify!))\nTherefore it is customary not to distinguish between real numbers and real\npoints in C, \u201cidentifying\u201d x with (x,0) in C, as was explained above. With this\nconvention, E1 becomes simply a subset (and a subfield) of C. Henceforth, we\nshall simply say that \u201cx is real\u201d or \u201cx E1,\u201d instead of saying that \u201cx = (x,0)\n\u2208\nis a real point in C.\u201d We then also obtain the following result.\nTheorem 2. Every complex number z has a unique representation as a sum:\nz = x+yi, where x and y are real and i = (0,1) is the imaginary unit.\nProof. By our convention, x and y stand for (x,0) and (y,0), respectively;\nthus x+yi = (x,0)+(y,0) (0,1). Computing the right side expression from\n\u00b7\ndefinitions, we obtain for any x,y E1\n\u2208\nx+yi = (x,0)+(y 0 0 1,y 1+0 0) = (x,0)+(0,y) = (x,y).\n\u00b7 \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nThus (x,y) = x+yi for any x,y E1. If, in particular, we take the coordinates\n\u2208\nof z for x and y in that formula, we obtain z = (x,y) = x + yi, which is the\nrequired representation.\nTo prove its uniqueness, suppose that we also have = x\u2032 +y\u2032i, where x\u2032 =\n(x\u2032,0) and y\u2032 = (y\u2032,0). But then, as was shown above,\nz = (x\u2032,0)+(y\u2032,0) (0,1) = (x\u2032,y\u2032),\n\u00b7\nand so z = (x\u2032,y\u2032). Since also z = (x,y), we have (x,y) = (x\u2032,y\u2032), i.e., the\npairs (x,y) and (x\u2032,y\u2032) are the same, and so x = x\u2032, y = y\u2032 after all. Thus the\ntheorem is proved. (cid:3)\nWe shall now consider the geomet-\nY\nric representation of complex num-\nz\nbers as points of the Cartesian plane y\n(see Figure 23). The x-axis comprises\nall the \u201creal points\u201d; the y-axis con- r\nsists of all \u201cimaginary\u201d points\u201d. The\nrest of the plane represents all the\n\u03b8\nother complex numbers. Instead of\nthe Cartesian coordinates (x,y), we 0 x X\nmay also use polar coordinates (r,\u03b8),\nFigure 23\nwhere r = x2 +y2 is the absolute\nvalue z of z = (x,y) and \u03b8 is the (counterclockwise) rotation angle from the\n| | p 176 Chapter 3. The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nx-axis to 0z (representedasthe directed line segment0z). Clearly, z is uniquely\ndetermined by r and \u03b8, but \u03b8 is not uniquely determined by z; indeed, the same\npoint of the plane results if \u03b8 is replaced by \u03b8 + 2n\u03c0 (n = 1, 2, ...); r and \u03b8\nare called, respectively, the modulus and argument of z = (x,y). By elemen-\ntary trigonometry, we have x = rcos\u03b8 and y = rsin\u03b8. Substituting this in\nz = x+yi (see Theorem 2), we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. z = r(cos\u03b8 +isin\u03b8) (\u201ctrigonometric form of z\u201d).\nIn conclusion, we note that since C is a field, all consequences of the field\nAxiomsI\u2013VI(butnotVII\u2013IX)applytoit.

We have occasionally mentioned that there are vector spaces other than En.\nNow we shall dwell on this matter in more detail.\nLet V be an arbitrary set whoseelements will be called \u201cpoints\u201d or \u201cvectors\u201d\n(even though they may have nothing in common with E1 or En). Suppose\nthat a certain binary operation (call it \u201caddition\u201d) has somehow been defined\nin V in such a manner that the first five axioms for real numbers hold for\nthis \u201caddition\u201d.

In\nthis section, however, only commutative groups will be considered. Note that\nthe operation (+) need not be the ordinary addition, and sometimes other\nsymbols are used instead of \u201c+\u201d. For an example of a noncommutative group,\nsee Problem 8 in 6 of Chapter 1.\n\u00a7\nNext, let F be any field (e.g., E1 or C); its elements will be called scalars; its\nzero-element will be denoted by 0, and its unity by 1. Suppose that yet another\noperation (call it \u201cmultiplication of scalars by vectors\u201d) has been defined that\nassigns to every scalar a F and every vector x V a certain vector ax V,\n\u2208 \u2208 \u2208\ncalled the a-multiple of x, and suppose that it satisfies the following laws:\n( a,b F) ( x,y V)\n\u2200 \u2208 \u2200 \u2208\na(x+y) = ax+ay, (a+b)x = ax+bx, (ab)x = a(bx), and 1x = x.\nIn other words, we assume that all laws of Theorem 1 of 1 are valid. In this\n\u00a7\ncase, V together with these two operations is called a vector space, or a linear\nspace, over the field F; F is called its field of scalars or scalar field.\nExamples.\n(a) En is a vector space over E1 (its scalar field), with operations as defined\nin 1.

Dot products in Cn are defined by\nn\nx y = x y ,\n\u00b7 k k\nk=1\nX 180 Chapter 3. The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nwhere y is the conjugate of the complex number y (cf. 8).

Moreover, x x = 0 iff x =~0.\n\u2265 \u00b7\n(iii) x y = y x (= conjugate of y x). Thus commutativity fails in general.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(iv) ( a,b C) (ax) (by) = (ab)(x y); hence\n\u2200 \u2208 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(iv\u2032) (ax) y = a(x y) = x (ay).\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(v) (x+y) z = x z +y z and\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(v\u2032) z (x+y) = z x+z y (distributive laws).\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nObserve that (v\u2032) follows from (v) by using (iii). Verify!\nIII. Sometimes (but not always) dot products can also be defined on complex\nor real linear spaces other than Cn or En in such a manner that they satisfy\nthe laws (i)\u2013(v) listed above (with C replaced by E1 if the space is real). If\nthese laws hold, the space is called a (complex or real) Euclidean space.1 In\nparticular, Cn is a complex Euclidean space, and En is a real Euclidean space.\nIn every Euclidean space (real or complex), one can define absolute values of\nvectors by setting x = \u221ax x (this root exists in E1 since x x 0 by formula\n| | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265\n(ii) above). In particular, this definition applies to Cn and En (cf. 2, Note 3).\n\u00a7\nThen, similarly as was done for En, one obtains the following laws, valid for\nall vectors x,y and any scalar a:\n(a\u2032) x 0; and x = 0 iff x = \u00af0;\n| | \u2265 | |\n(b\u2032) ax = a x ;\n| | | || |\n(c\u2032) x+y x + y (triangle inequality);\n| | \u2264 | | | |\n(d\u2032) x y x y (Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality).\n| \u00b7 | \u2264 | || |\nIn particular, these laws are valid in Cn and En.\nTheproofisanalogoustothatofTheorem 2of 2.

Normed Linear Spaces\nIn 9 we saw how absolute values can be defined from inner products in Eu-\n\u00a7\nclidean spaces. Sometimes, however, absolute values can be defined directly,\neven in non-Euclidean linear spaces (where there are no dot products), \u201cby-\npassing\u201d inner products altogether. All that is required is to assign, in some\nway or other, a real absolute value x to every vector x in such a manner that\n| |\nlaws (a\u2032)\u2013(c\u2032) specified in 9 are satisfied (excluding (d\u2032) since it has no sense if\n\u00a7\nthere are no dot products). A vector space equipped with such absolute values\nis called a normed linear space. Thus, we have the following definition.\nDefinition 1.\nA normed linear space is a real or complex vector space V in which every\nvector v is associated with a real number v , called its absolute value (or\n| |\nnorm or magnitude), such that, for any vectors u, v V and any scalar\n\u2208\na (in E1 or C, as the case may be),\n(i) v 0;\n| | \u2265\n(i\u2032) v = 0 iff v =~0;\n| |\n(ii) av = a v ; and\n| | | || |\n(iii) u+v u + v (triangle inequality).\n| | \u2264 | | | | 184 Chapter 3. The Geometry of n Dimensions. \u2217 Vector Spaces\nSometimes we write v for v or use other similar symbols.\nk k | |\nMathematically, the existence of absolute values in V amounts to the exis-\ntence of a mapping v v on V, i.e., a mapping \u03d5:V E1, with function\n\u2192 | | \u2192\nvalues \u03d5(v) written as v , satisfying the laws (i)\u2013(iii). Any such mapping is\n| |\ncalled a norm map (briefly, \u201cnorm\u201d) on V. Thus, to define absolute values in\nV means to define a norm map v v on V, satisfying (i)\u2013(iii). Often this\n\u2192 | |\ncan be done in many different ways, thus giving rise to different norms on V,\nall satisfying (i)\u2013(iii).\nNote 1. There also are maps v v that satisfy (i), (ii), and (iii) but\n\u2192 | |\nonly a weaker form of (i\u2032), namely, ~0 = 0, so that v may vanish if v = ~0.\n| | | | 6\nSuch maps are called semi-norms, and vector spaces equipped with such maps\nare called semi-normed linear spaces.\nExamples.\n(1) Every Euclidean space (in particular, En and Cn) is also a normed linear\nspace, with the norm defined by\nv = \u221av v.\n| | \u00b7\nIndeed, as was shown in 9, absolute values so defined satisfy (a\u2032)\u2013(c\u2032),\n\u00a7\ni.e., laws (i)\u2013(iii) of Definition 1. In En and Cn, one can also define v\n| |\ndirectly in terms of coordinates, setting\nn\nv = v 2,\nk\n| | | |\ns\nk=1\nX\nwhich is equivalent to v = \u221av v. This is the so-called standard norm\n| | \u00b7\non En (Cn).\n(2) One can also define various \u201cnonstandard\u201d norms on En and Cn; e.g., fix\nsome real number p 1 and put\n\u2265\nn\np\nv = v p.\nk\nk k | |\ns\nk=1\nX\nIt can be shown that this yields another norm map v v . (See Prob-\n\u2192 k k\nlems 9\u201311 below.)\n(3) A semi-norm on En and Cn is obtained by setting\nv = v where v = (v , v , ..., v );\n1 1 2 n\n| | | |\ne.g., if v = (0, 1, 1, ..., 1), then v = 0 because v = 0. Thus formula\n1\n| |\n(i\u2032) fails here, but the remaining laws (i)\u2013(iii) do hold, as is easily verified.\nTherefore, we have a semi-norm here, not a norm. \u2217 10. Normed Linear Spaces 185\n\u00a7\n(4) Let W be the set of all bounded real functions on a set A = , i.e., maps\n6 \u2205\nf:A E1 such that\n\u2192\n( x A) f(x) < c\n\u2200 \u2208 | |\nfor some constant c (depending on f only). Due to boundedness, the set\nof all absolute values f(x) , for a given f W, has a l.u.b. in E1; we\n| | \u2208\ndenote it by f . Thus\nk k\nf = sup f(x) , x A.\nk k | | \u2208\nWe also define operations in W as in Example (d) of 9, i.e., setting for\n\u00a7\nany a E1 and any f, g W,\n\u2208 \u2208\n( x A) (f +g)(x) = f(x)+g(x) and (af)(x) = a f(x).\n\u2200 \u2208 \u00b7\nThus the maps f +g and af are defined on A.\nIt is easy to show that these definitions make W a normed linear space,\nwith norm f = sup f(x) for f W.
