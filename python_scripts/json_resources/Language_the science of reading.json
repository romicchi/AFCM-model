{"text":"The Science of Reading\nWhat is the Science of Reading?\nThe science of reading refers to a body of research from the fields of education,\ncognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and neuroscience, that explains how\nindividuals learn how to read and best practices for reading instruction1, 2. Recent\nadvances in technology and a greater understanding of neurobiology have allowed\nresearchers and practitioners who work with typical and struggling readers to\nunderstand how reading develops in the brain and the skills that contribute to proficient\nreading. It is important for educators to understand this body of research because it\ndirectly affects how reading is taught and using methods that are not aligned with\nresearch can have a negative impact on students\u2019 reading achievement. As such, the\npurpose of this section of the toolkit is to provide a brief overview of this body of\nresearch and provide additional resources for educators and other practitioners to\nexplore.\nAreas of the Brain Involved in Reading\nA common misconception about reading is that all humans \u201clearn to read in a different\nway.\u201d Although reading is a relatively recent cultural invention, the human brain is not\nprewired to learn to read naturally3. Neurobiological research has demonstrated that\nreading is a complex process that occurs in three different but connected areas of the\nbrain1,4. These three areas work together to help individuals read words:\n\u2022 Frontal Lobe \u2013 the inferior frontal gyrus in the frontal lobe is responsible for\ngrammatical and speech processing, in addition to information about the sounds\nin words\n\u2022 Temporoparietal Area \u2013 responsible for processing and storing speech sounds;\nwhere phonemes (sounds) are connected to graphemes (letters); also involved in\nword and sentence meanings\n\u2022 Occipitotemporal Area \u2013 processes visual information (e.g., letters, words)\nImaging studies, such as fMRI studies, show that these different areas of the brain are\nactivated during reading4. There are two main pathways of the brain that are activated\nduring reading:\n1. Dorsal Pathway \u2013 activated during decoding\/sounding out\n2. Ventral Pathway \u2013 activated when words are read by sight (i.e., automatically\nwithout sounding out)\nStruggling readers, including students with dyslexia, activate different pathways and\nareas of their brain than proficient readers do, which causes these students to use\nUpd at ed 2\/ 21 other, less efficient, areas of their brain to read words4. Despite this, high-quality\nevidence-based instruction and intervention can actually \u201crewire\u201d the brains of students\nwith dyslexia so that they can use more efficient areas and pathways to read5.\nThe Simple View of Reading and Scarborough\u2019s Reading Rope\nIn the Simple View of Reading (SVR), reading comprehension is conceptualized as the\nproduct of two component skills: decoding and linguistic comprehension6,7. Decoding, a\nword-level skill, involves rapidly and efficiently retrieving words from memory, and\nlinguistic comprehension consists of the literal and inferential construction and\ninterpretation of the meaning of those words7,8. If an individual is able to decode words,\nbut does not understand what those words mean, then they will not be able to\ncomprehend a text. Conversely, if an individual is able to understand what words mean,\nbut not decode them, they will also not be able to comprehend text. Because many\nstudents with dyslexia have difficulties with decoding, they are likely to have difficulty\ncomprehending text. This does NOT mean that reading is a simple process, only that\ntwo main components (decoding and linguistic comprehension) contribute the most to\noverall reading comprehension. Click here to view an infographic about the Simple View\nof Reading.\nScarborough (2001)9 created a graphic called the \u201cReading Rope\u201d that depicts the\ncomponents of the SVR. To become a skilled reader, a student must develop increasing\nspeed and accuracy in decoding and linguistic comprehension skills9. Specifically,\nautomatic decoding frees up an individual\u2019s attentional resources so that they can\ncomprehend text. To reach this level of automaticity, students require proper instruction\nthat focuses on mastering decoding skills.

While acquiring the alphabetic principle, individuals\nprogress through several stages of alphabetic decoding, in which they learn to map\nphonemes to graphemes10,12,13. Ehri\u2019s (1998)12 stage model of reading development\ndescribes these progressive stages as follows:\n\u25cf Pre-Alphabetic \u2013 pre-reading stage where individuals do not make letter-to-sound\nconnections; \u201creading\u201d is based on visual cues\n\u25cf Partial Alphabetic \u2013 individuals begin to connect some phonemes to graphemes,\nbut these representations are not complete\nUpd at ed 2\/ 21 \u25cf Full Alphabetic \u2013 individuals develop more complete representations of words\nand their phoneme-grapheme relationships\n\u25cf Consolidated Alphabetic \u2013 individuals have acquired a large bank of words they\ncan read by sight (i.e., automatically and accurately) and now recognize larger\nunits of language in words such as syllables and morphemes\nIndividuals progress through similar stages for spelling11,14; however, spelling is often\nmore difficult for individuals to acquire than word-reading14,15,16,17. Spelling requires\nindividuals to learn to visually identify letters by their shape and to physically produce\nthose shapes11. Proficient spelling also requires individuals to acquire in-depth\nknowledge about the structure of the English language system14. Spelling proficiency is\nacquired by learning about different patterns in words:\n\u25cf Phonological (Sound) Patterns \u2013 understanding of the sounds in words\n\u25cf Graphotactic (Written) Patterns \u2013 how words are written or represented in print\n\u25cf Morphological (Structure) Patterns \u2013 understanding the meanings of words or\nparts of words\nWord-reading is also acquired and enhanced through an individual\u2019s spelling\ndevelopment. As an individual repeatedly associates phonemes to graphemes and\nlarger units of language (i.e., orthographic mapping), these association become\nengrained in the memory and easier to retrieve with automaticity12,13.\nAccurate and Automatic Word-Reading\nAlthough individuals initially learn to read by activating the dorsal pathway in the brain to\ndecode words, the dorsal pathway is slower and less automatic than the ventral\npathway where words are read by sight. There are two key processes necessary for\naccurate and automatic sight-word reading (i.e., proficient word-reading):\n1. connecting a word\u2019s pronunciation to its meaning and spelling; and\n2. connecting a word\u2019s meaning to its spelling, so that it can be read without going\nthrough the phonological system which slows down the process10,13,18.\nProficient word-reading occurs when a word\u2019s pronunciation is associated with its\nmeaning and its written spelling13,14,18. With practice, individuals begin to automatically\nconnect words\u2019 pronunciations, meanings, and spellings and this allows an individual\u2019s\nspeed and accuracy to improve19,20. This also helps individuals bypass the slower and\nless efficient dorsal\/decoding pathway. This allows the cognitive resources (i.e., working\nmemory) to be allocated to reading comprehension21,22,23. If individuals do not become\naccurate and automatic word-readers, then they must constantly rely on the slower\ndorsal pathway to decode words, which can cause difficulties with spelling, word-\nreading, and text comprehension10,20.\nUpd at ed 2\/ 21 Linguistic\/Language Comprehension\nAccurate and automatic word-reading alone is not sufficient for individuals to be able to\ncomprehend text. Proficient reading comprehension also requires the reader to be able\nto comprehend language6. Language comprehension requires in-depth knowledge of\nmorphology, semantics, syntax, background knowledge, verbal reasoning, and literacy\nknowledge3,9. Morphology is the study of the smallest units of language that have\nmeaning (i.e., prefixes, suffixes, roots, base words). Semantics (vocabulary) involves\nthe meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. Syntax includes grammatical structure\nand parts of speech.\nThe Five Components of Reading\nHow does all of this information relate to the five \u201ccomponents\u201d of reading, as identified\nby the National Reading Panel\u2019s (NRP\u2019s) report on reading instruction24? Although the\nNRP identified five \u201ccomponents\u201d of reading instruction from research (phonemic\nawareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and reading comprehension), it is important to\nnote that each of these \u201ccomponents\u201d are highly connected and should not be taught as\ndistinct skills25. For example, phonological awareness, phonics, and word-reading\nfluency are a part of decoding or word-recognition in the SVR, whereas vocabulary is a\npart of linguistic comprehension. These components are typically taught together in a\ncomprehensive literacy program. The five \u201ccomponents\u201d are described below3,24:\n\u25cf Phonemic Awareness \u2013 the ability to identify, think about, and manipulate the\nsmallest sounds (phonemes) in language\n\u25cf Phonics \u2013 a method for teaching phoneme-grapheme correspondences for\nreading and spelling\n\u25cf Fluency \u2013 the ability to read a text accurately, automatically, and with expression\n\u25cf Vocabulary \u2013 understanding and using words in oral and written language\n\u25cf Comprehension \u2013 the ultimate goal of reading; understanding what is read\nAdditional Resources about The Science of Reading\nAdditional resources (e.g., books, articles, websites, learning modules) about the\nScience of Reading are available in the Science of Reading Resources section of this\ntoolkit.
