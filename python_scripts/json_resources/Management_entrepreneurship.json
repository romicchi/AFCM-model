Entrepreneurship is not so much a skill as a habitual state of mind.\nWhen entrepreneurship describes activities within a firm or large organization, it is referred to as intrapreneurship and may include\ncorporate venturing, when large entities spin off organizations.\nEntrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called the gale of creative destruction to replace wholly or partly inferior innovations across\nmarkets and industries. This destruction simultaneously creates new products and new business models.\nEntrepreneurship ranges in scale from solo projects (even involving the part-time entrepreneur) to major undertakings that create many\njob opportunities.\nEntrepreneurial activities can be incremental or disruptive. Incremental innovations are a number of small changes that transform process\nflows while disruptive innovations are entirely new approaches.\nKey Terms\nentrepreneur: A person who organizes and operates a business venture and assumes much of the associated risk.\nentrepreneurship: The art or science of innovation and risk-taking for profit in business.\nEntrepreneurs\nEntrepreneurs are innovators, willing to take risks and generate new ideas to create unique and potentially profitable solutions to\nmodern-day problems. This innovation may result in new organizations or revitalize mature organizations in response to a perceived\nopportunity. The most obvious form of entrepreneurship is starting a new business (referred as a startup company). In recent years, the\nterm has been extended to include social and political forms of entrepreneurial activity, which are often referred to as social\nentrepreneurship.\nEntrepreneurial activities differ substantially depending on the type of organization and creativity involved. Entrepreneurship ranges in\nscale from solo projects (that can even involve the entrepreneur working only part-time) to major undertakings that create many job\nopportunities. Many high-value entrepreneurial ventures seek venture capital or angel funding (seed money) to raise capital for building\nthe business.\nFostering Entrepreneurship\nWhen entrepreneurship describes activities within a firm or large organization, it is referred to as intrapreneurship and may include\ncorporate venturing, in which large entities create spin-off organizations. Corporations have become aware of the potential advantages of\ninternal entrepreneurial activity and often have innovation specialists in their organizations to develop creative solutions for complex\nproblems. Google has become well known for allowing all employees to dedicate 20 percent of their time to any new project of their\nchoosing. Entrepreneurs have become an integral part of business.\nMany kinds of organizations now exist to support would-be entrepreneurs, including specialized government agencies, business\nincubators, science parks, and some non-governmental organizations. More recently, the term entrepreneurship has been extended to\ninclude elements unrelated to business formation activity. Concepts of entrepreneurship as a specific mindset have emerged, resulting in\ninitiatives like social entrepreneurship, political entrepreneurship, and knowledge entrepreneurship.\nDisruptive and Incremental\nJoseph Schumpeter describes an entrepreneur as \"a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful\ninnovation.\" Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called the gale of creative destruction. Schumpeter's idea encompasses more\nthan single innovations, as he further explains how innovative thinking allows for a sustainable and long-term economic growth for\nsocieties that enable it. Creating new goods and new ways of doing things allows for consistent job growth, more consumption, and more\neconomic dynamism. Innovative thinking allows for so-called disruptive innovations\u2014innovations which make leaps and bounds over\nexisting products. One classic example is the iPhone.\nSchumpeter's view is not the only one, however. Incremental innovation is also largely recognized as a vital entrepreneurial pursuit. The\nidea of incremental innovation is simple: large change is a byproduct of small innovations compounded with others. Incremental\ninnovators find ways to improve the efficiency of established processes to drive efficiency. An example of this kind of innovation is\nToyota's just-in-time inventory management. Incremental innovations are often process-based, while disruptive innovations are usually\nnew goods or processes themselves.\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
