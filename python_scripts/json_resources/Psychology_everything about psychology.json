Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go\non to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on\ncollegecampusesacrosstheUnitedStates(Johnson&Lubin,2011).Anumberofwell-knownindividuals\nwere psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\u2019s creator Mark Zuckerberg,\ntelevision personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes\nCraven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the\ndiscipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2013).\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons.

They learn about basic principles that\nguide how we think and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across\nindividuals and across cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch a briefvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/psycmajor)that describes some\nof the questions a student should consider before deciding to major in psychology. 8 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\n1.2 History of Psychology\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\n\u2022 Appreciate Freud\u2019s influence on psychology\n\u2022 Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\n\u2022 Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology\u2019s history\n\u2022 Understand basic tenets of humanism\n\u2022 Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology\u2019s focus back to the mind\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring\nissuesrelatedtothemindgenerallydidsoinaphilosophicalcontextpriortothe19thcentury.Twomen,\nworking in the 19th century, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a science and\nacademic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. Their names were Wilhelm Wundt and William\nJames. This section will provide an overview of the shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology\nfrom Wundt and James through today.\nWUNDT AND STRUCTURALISM\nWilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\npsychologist.HisfamousbookentitledPrinciplesofPhysiologicalPsychologywaspublishedin1873.Wundt\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of\npsychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result\nin our conscious experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it \u201cinternal perception\u201d), a process by\nwhich someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human\nmind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed. Wundt\u2019s version of introspection used\nonly very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a\nscientifically observable (repeatable) experience of the mind (Danziger, 1980). The first stringent\nrequirementwastheuseof\u201ctrained\u201dorpracticedobservers, whocouldimmediatelyobserveandreport\na reaction. The second requirement was the use of repeatable stimuli that always produced the same\nexperience in the subject and allowed the subject to expect and thus be fully attentive to the inner\nreaction.Theseexperimentalrequirementswereputinplacetoeliminate\u201cinterpretation\u201dinthereporting\nof internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is\nobservingtheirmindorconsciousnessaccurately,sinceitcannotbeseenbyanyotherperson.Thisattempt\ntounderstandthestructureorcharacteristicsofthemindwasknownasstructuralism.Wundtestablished\nhis psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure 1.3). In this laboratory, Wundt\nand his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A subject, sometimes in a room\nisolatedfromthescientist,wouldreceiveastimulussuchasalight,image,orsound.Thesubject\u2019sreaction\nto the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the time to reaction. Wundt\ncould measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 9\nFigure 1.3 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in his\nlaboratory in Germany.\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained\nhighlysubjective,andtherewasverylittleagreementbetweenindividuals.Asaresult,structuralismfell\nout of favor with the passing of Wundt\u2019s student, Edward Titchener, in 1927 (Gordon, 1995).\nJAMES AND FUNCTIONALISM\nWilliam James (1842\u20131910) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on\nhow psychology should operate (Figure 1.4). James was introduced to Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by\nnatural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism\u2019s characteristics. Key to that theory is\nthe idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are adapted to their environment, including their\nbehavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction\nof the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James saw it, psychology\u2019s purpose was to\nstudy the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective was known as functionalism.\nFunctionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment.\nFunctionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in the\noperationofthewholemindratherthanofitsindividualparts,whichwerethefocusofstructuralism.Like\nWundt,Jamesbelievedthatintrospectioncouldserveasonemeansbywhichsomeonemightstudymental\nactivities,butJamesalsoreliedonmoreobjectivemeasures,includingtheuseofvariousrecordingdevices,\nandexaminationsofconcreteproductsofmentalactivitiesandofanatomyandphysiology(Gordon,1995).\nFigure 1.4 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist. 10 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nFREUD AND PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY\nPerhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology\u2019s history was Sigmund Freud\n(Figure 1.5). Freud (1856\u20131939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering\nfrom \u201chysteria\u201d and neurosis. Hysteria was anancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with\na wide variety of symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which\nhad an apparent physical cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients\u2019 problems arose from the\nunconsciousmind.InFreud\u2019sview,theunconsciousmindwasarepositoryoffeelingsandurgesofwhich\nwe have no awareness. Gaining access to the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution\nof the patient\u2019s problems. According to Freud, the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream\nanalysis,byexaminationsofthefirstwordsthatcametopeople\u2019sminds,andthroughseeminglyinnocent\nslips of thetongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on therole of aperson\u2019s unconscious, as well as early\nchildhoodexperiences,andthisparticularperspectivedominatedclinicalpsychologyforseveraldecades\n(Thorne & Henley, 2005).\nFigure 1.5 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many books,\nA General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published in 1922.\nFreud\u2019sideaswereinfluential,andyouwilllearnmoreaboutthemwhenyoustudylifespandevelopment,\npersonality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the\nimpactofearlychildhoodexperiencesontherestofaperson\u2019slife.Themethodofpsychoanalysis,which\ninvolvesthepatienttalkingabouttheirexperiencesandselves,whilenotinventedbyFreud,wascertainly\npopularized by him and is still used today. Many of Freud\u2019s other ideas, however, are controversial.\nDrew Westen (1998) argues that many of the criticisms of Freud\u2019s ideas are misplaced, in that they\nattack his older ideas without taking into account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to\nconsider the success of the broad ideas that Freud introduced or developed, such as the importance\nof childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role of unconscious versus conscious motivations in\ndrivingourbehavior,thefactthatmotivationscancauseconflictsthataffectbehavior,theeffectsofmental\nrepresentations of ourselves and others in guiding our interactions, and the development of personality\nover time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for all of these ideas.\nMore modern iterations of Freud\u2019s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective\n(Knektetal.,2008;Shedler,2010).Somecurrentpracticesinpsychotherapyinvolveexaminingunconscious\naspects of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 11\nFreud\u2019s historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of\nthe historical movements within psychology.\nWERTHEIMER, KOFFKA, K\u00d6HLER, AND GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY\nMax Wertheimer (1880\u20131943), Kurt Koffka (1886\u20131941), and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (1887\u20131967) were three\nGerman psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi\nGermany. These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt\nprinciples.ThewordGestaltroughlytranslatesto\u201cwhole;\u201damajoremphasisofGestaltpsychologydeals\nwiththefactthatalthoughasensoryexperiencecanbebrokendownintoindividualparts,howthoseparts\nrelatetoeachotherasawholeisoftenwhattheindividualrespondstoinperception.Forexample,asong\nmay be made up of individual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is\nperceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many\nways,thisparticularperspectivewouldhavedirectlycontradictedWundt\u2019sideasofstructuralism(Thorne\n& Henley, 2005).\nUnfortunately, in moving to the United States, these men were forced to abandon much of their work\nand were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of\nbehaviorism(describednext)intheUnitedStatespreventedprinciplesofGestaltpsychologyfrombeingas\ninfluentialintheUnitedStatesastheyhadbeenintheirnativeGermany(Thorne&Henley,2005).Despite\nthese issues, several Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual\nas a whole rather than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in\nhumanistic theory late in the century. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on\nsensation and perception.\nStructuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with\ndescribingandunderstandinginnerexperience.Butotherresearchershadconcernsthatinnerexperience\ncould be a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the\nobjectively observable outcome of mental processes.\nPAVLOV, WATSON, SKINNER, AND BEHAVIORISM\nEarly work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936).\nPavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human\nproduced a reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the\nresponse to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex\nPavlov worked with was salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be\nelicited using a second stimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the\ninitial food stimulus several times. Once the response to the second stimulus was \u201clearned,\u201d the food\nstimuluscouldbeomitted.Pavlov\u2019s\u201cclassicalconditioning\u201disonlyoneformoflearningbehaviorstudied\nby behaviorists.\nJohnB.Watson(1878\u20131958)wasaninfluentialAmericanpsychologistwhosemostfamousworkoccurred\nduring the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University (Figure 1.6). While Wundt and James were\nconcerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness\nwasflawed.Becausehebelievedthatobjectiveanalysisofthemindwasimpossible,Watsonpreferredto\nfocus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major\nproponentofshiftingthefocusofpsychologyfromthemindtobehavior,andthisapproachofobserving\nandcontrollingbehaviorcametobeknownasbehaviorism.Amajorobjectofstudybybehavioristswas\nlearned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used\nanimalsinexperimentsundertheassumptionthatwhatwaslearnedusinganimalmodelscould,tosome\ndegree,beappliedtohumanbehavior.Indeed,Tolman(1938)stated,\u201cIbelievethateverythingimportant\ninpsychology(except\u2026suchmattersasinvolvesocietyandwords)canbeinvestigatedinessencethrough\nthecontinuedexperimentalandtheoreticalanalysisofthedeterminersofratbehavioratachoice-pointin 12 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\na maze.\u201d\nFigure 1.6 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology.\nBehaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt\ntoday (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a\nscientific discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used\nin behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom\nsettings. Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.\nB. F. Skinner (1904\u20131990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.7). Like Watson, Skinner was a\nbehaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner\nspoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research,\nSkinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior\nthroughreinforcementandpunishment.Thisdevice,knownasanoperantconditioningchamber(ormore\nfamiliarly, a Skinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne &\nHenley, 2005).\nFigure 1.7 (a) B. F. Skinner is famous for his research on operant conditioning. (b) Modified versions of the operant\nconditioning chamber, or Skinner box, are still widely used in research settings today. (credit a: modification of work\nby \"Silly rabbit\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nThe Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior\nindicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to\ndeliverapositivereinforcementofthebehavior(suchasfood)orapunishment(suchasanoise)oratoken\nconditioner (such as a light) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment.\nSkinner\u2019s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in\npsychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite\nthis, conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification. Skinner\u2019s two widely read and\ncontroversial popular science books about the value of operant conditioning for creating happier lives\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 13\nremain as thought-provoking arguments for his approach (Greengrass, 2004).\nMASLOW, ROGERS, AND HUMANISM\nDuringtheearly20thcentury,Americanpsychologywasdominatedbybehaviorismandpsychoanalysis.\nHowever, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being\nso influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the\nunconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.\nBehaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by\na combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that\nemphasizedpersonalcontrol,intentionality,andatruepredispositionfor\u201cgood\u201dasimportantforourself-\nconceptandourbehavior.Thus,humanismemerged.Humanismisaperspectivewithinpsychologythat\nemphasizesthepotentialforgoodthatisinnatetoallhumans.Twoofthemostwell-knownproponentsof\nhumanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O\u2019Hara, n.d.).\nAbrahamMaslow(1908\u20131970)wasanAmericanpsychologistwhoisbestknownforproposingahierarchy\nof human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.8). Although this concept will be discussed in more\ndetailinalaterchapter,abriefoverviewwillbeprovidedhere.Maslowassertedthatsolongasbasicneeds\nnecessary for survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would\nbegin to motivate behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a\nprocess by which we achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human\nnaturethatarecharacteristicofthehumanisticperspectiveisevident(Thorne&Henley,2005).Humanistic\npsychologists rejected, on principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the\ntradition of the physical and biological sciences, because it missed the \u201cwhole\u201d human being. Beginning\nwith Maslow and Rogers, there was an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program\nhas been largely qualitative (not measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research\nstrainswithinhumanisticpsychology,includingresearchonhappiness,self-concept,meditation,andthe\noutcomes of humanistic psychotherapy (Friedman, 2008).\nFigure 1.8 Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is shown.\nCarlRogers(1902\u20131987)wasalsoanAmericanpsychologistwho,likeMaslow,emphasizedthepotential 14 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nfor good that exists within all people (Figure 1.9). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-\ncentered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking\npsychotherapy. Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in\ninterpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy\ninvolves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to\ndisplay three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive\nregard, genuineness, and empathy. Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist\naccepts their client for who they are, no matter what he or she might say. Provided these factors, Rogers\nbelieved that people were more than capable of dealing with and working through their own issues\n(Thorne & Henley, 2005).\nFigure 1.9 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been influential\nin clinical settings.

Furthermore, Rogers\u2019 client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly\nused in psychotherapeutic settings today (O\u2019hara, n.d.)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView a briefvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/crogers1)of Carl Rogers\ndescribing his therapeutic approach.\nTHE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION\nBehaviorism\u2019semphasisonobjectivityandfocusonexternalbehaviorhadpulledpsychologists\u2019attention\naway from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists\nredirectedattentiontotheindividualhumanasawhole,andasaconsciousandself-awarebeing.Bythe\n1950s, new disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging,\nand these areas revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective\nhascometobeknownasthecognitiverevolution(Miller,2003).By1967,UlricNeisserpublishedthefirst\ntextbookentitledCognitivePsychology,whichservedasacoretextincognitivepsychologycoursesaround\nthe country (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 15\nwas very influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.10). Chomsky (1928\u2013), an American\nlinguist, was dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that\npsychology\u2019s focus on behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental\nfunctioning into its purview if it were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior\n(Miller, 2003).\nFigure 1.10 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology;\nand thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European\npsychologists and their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with\nscientistsinotherfields,likeanthropology,linguistics,computerscience,andneuroscience,amongothers.\nThis interdisciplinary approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and\nprominence of this particular perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\nDIG DEEPER\nFeminist Psychology\nThescienceofpsychologyhashadanimpactonhumanwellbeing,bothpositiveandnegative.Thedominant\ninfluence of Western, white, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\ndevelopedwiththebiasesinherentinthoseindividuals,whichoftenhadnegativeconsequencesformembers\nof society that were not white or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and\nother countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than heterosexual had difficulties entering the\nfield of psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of white,\nmalepsychologists,whowerenotimmunetothenonscientificattitudesprevalentinthesocietyinwhichthey\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a \u201cwomanless\u201d psychology\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\ninfluenceonwhatwasstudied.Inaddition,theexperimentalsubjectsofpsychologyweremostlymen,which\nresultedfromunderlyingassumptionsthatgenderhadnoinfluenceonpsychologyandthatwomenwerenot\nof sufficient interest to study.\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution\nin psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male\npsychologists for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without\ncareful experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples,\nstatements by prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: \u201c. . . we must\nstartwiththerealizationthat,asmuchaswomenwanttobegoodscientistsorengineers,theywantfirstand\nforemost to be womanly companions of men and to be mothers.\u201d Weisstein\u2019s critique formed the foundation\nfor the subsequent development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male\ncultural biases on our knowledge of the psychology of women and, indeed, of both genders.\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as 16 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nfeminist psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history\nof psychology, studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the\npractice of the scientific approach to knowledge.\nMULTICULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY\nCulture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology, yet the effects of culture on\npsychology are under-studied. There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white,\nAmericansettingscouldbeassumedtoapplytoindividualsandsocialgroupsfromotherculturesandthis\nis unlikely to be true (Betancourt & L\u00f3pez, 1993). One weakness in the field of cross-cultural psychology\nis that in looking for differences in psychological attributes across cultures, there remains a need to go\nbeyondsimpledescriptivestatistics(Betancourt&L\u00f3pez,1993).Inthissense,ithasremainedadescriptive\nscience, rather than one seeking to determine cause and effect. For example, a study of characteristics of\nindividuals seeking treatment for a binge eating disorder in Hispanic American, African American, and\nCaucasian American individuals found significant differences between groups (Franko et al., 2012). The\nstudy concluded that results from studying any one of the groups could not be extended to the other\ngroups, and yet potential causes of the differences were not measured.\nThishistoryofmulticulturalpsychology intheUnitedStatesisalongone.TheroleofAfricanAmerican\npsychologists in researching the cultural differences between African American individual and social\npsychologyisbutoneexample.In1920,CecilSumnerwasthefirstAfricanAmericantoreceiveaPhDin\npsychologyintheUnitedStates.SumnerestablishedapsychologydegreeprogramatHowardUniversity,\nleading to the education of a new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and\nOmari, 2004). Much of the work of early African American psychologists (and a general focus of much\nwork in first half of the 20th century in psychology in the United States) was dedicated to testing and\nintelligence testing in particular (Black et al., 2004). That emphasis has continued, particularly because\nof the importance of testing in determining opportunities for children, but other areas of exploration in\nAfrican-American psychology research include learning style, sense of community and belonging, and\nspiritualism (Black et al., 2004).\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\npsychologiststhatfacilitateinteractionsamongmembers.Sincepsychologistsbelongingtospecificethnic\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these\norganizations provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the impact of culture on individual\nand social psychology.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRead anews story (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/crogers2)about the influence of\nan African American\u2019s psychology research on the historicBrown v.

As such, they often combine the\nresearchstrategiesofbothpsychologistsandphysiologiststoaccomplishthisgoal(asdiscussedinCarlson, 18 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\n2013).\nFigure 1.11 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate behavior.\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited\nto, sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\nneurodevelopment,plasticityofthenervoussystem,andbiologicalcorrelatesofpsychologicaldisorders.\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably\ncomeasnosurprisethatindividualsfromallsortsofbackgroundsareinvolvedinthisresearch,including\nbiologists, medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often\nreferred to as neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\nWhilebiopsychology typically focuses ontheimmediate causes ofbehavior based inthephysiology ofa\nhumanorotheranimal,evolutionarypsychologyseekstostudytheultimatebiologicalcausesofbehavior.\nTo the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a\nhumanoranimal,willdemonstrateadaptiontoitssurroundings.Thesesurroundingsincludethephysical\nenvironmentand,sinceinteractionsbetweenorganismscanbeimportanttosurvivalandreproduction,the\nsocialenvironment.ThestudyofbehaviorinthecontextofevolutionhasitsoriginswithCharlesDarwin,\nthe co-discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors\nshouldbeadaptiveandwrotebookstitled,TheDescentofMan(1871)andTheExpressionoftheEmotionsin\nMan and Animals(1872), to explore this field.\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a\nresurgence in recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a\nsignificant genetic cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused\ngenetically, since the genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most\nevolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on\nevolutionary theory and then to make observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the\nresults match the theory. It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence\nthat a behavior is adaptive, since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not\nentirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is\nextraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason, some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume\nthe behaviors they study have genetic determinants (Confer et al., 2010).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 19\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\nenvironmentalandsocialconditionsfarbackinhumanhistory,andwehaveapoorunderstandingofwhat\ntheseconditionswere.Thismakespredictionsaboutwhatisadaptiveforabehaviordifficult.Behavioral\ntraits need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they\nevolved, about which we can only hypothesize.\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social\norganization, and status (Confer et al., 2010).\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between\nobservationsandexpectations.Inoneexample,inastudyofmatepreferencedifferencesbetweenmenand\nwomen that spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater\nthanmen,andmenvaluedpotentialreproductivefactors(youthandattractiveness)greaterthanwomenin\ntheirprospectivemates.Ingeneral,thepredictionswereinlinewiththepredictionsofevolution,although\nthere were deviations in some cultures.\nSENSATION AND PERCEPTION\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.12).

These are all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.\nFigure 1.12 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the\nsame, but your perception can vary dramatically.\nAs described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our\nexperienceofourworldisnotassimpleasthesumtotalofallofthesensoryinformation(orsensations)\ntogether. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our\nattention, our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.\nCOGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to\nfocustheirattentiononbetterunderstandingthemindandmentalprocessesthatunderliebehavior.Thus,\ncognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and\ntheirrelationshiptoourexperiencesandouractions.Likebiologicalpsychology,cognitivepsychologyis\nbroad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary\nbackgrounds.Thishasledsometocointhetermcognitivesciencetodescribetheinterdisciplinarynature\nof this area of research (Miller, 2003).\nCognitive psychologists have research interests thatspan aspectrum of topics, rangingfrom attention to\nproblemsolvingtolanguagetomemory.Theapproachesusedinstudyingthesetopicsareequallydiverse. 20 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nGivensuchdiversity,cognitivepsychologyisnotcapturedinonechapterofthistextperse;rather,various\nconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text\nonsensationandperception,thinkingandintelligence,memory,lifespandevelopment,socialpsychology,\nand therapy.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView abrief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cogpsys)recapping some of the\nmajor concepts explored by cognitive psychologists.\nDEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental\npsychologistsareinterestedinprocessesrelatedtophysicalmaturation.However,theirfocusisnotlimited\nto the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral\nreasoning, social behavior, and other psychological attributes.\nEarly developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching\nadulthood, providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities\nthat exist between very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.13)\ndemonstratedthatveryyoungchildrendonotdemonstrateobjectpermanence.Objectpermanencerefers\ntotheunderstandingthatphysicalthingscontinuetoexist,eveniftheyarehiddenfromus.Ifyouwereto\nshowanadultatoy,andthenhideitbehindacurtain,theadultknowsthatthetoystillexists.However,\nvery young infants act as if a hidden object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is\nachieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata, McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).\nFigure 1.13 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move from\ninfancy to adulthood.\nWhilePiagetwasfocused oncognitive changesduringinfancyandchildhood aswemovetoadulthood,\nthere is an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This\nmay be reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and\nmore people live longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed,\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 21\nit is estimated that there were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States\nin 2010. However, by 2020, this number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it\nis estimated that nearly 90 million people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and\nHuman Services, n.d.).\nPERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY\nPersonalitypsychologyfocusesonpatternsofthoughtsandbehaviorsthatmakeeachindividualunique.\nSeveralindividuals(e.g.,FreudandMaslow)thatwehavealreadydiscussedinourhistoricaloverviewof\npsychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality.\nThese early theorists attempted to explain how an individual\u2019s personality develops from his or her\ngivenperspective.Forexample,Freudproposedthatpersonalityaroseasconflictsbetweentheconscious\nand unconscious parts of the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that\nan individual went through various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult\npersonality would result from the resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of\nerogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing) zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the\ngenitals. Like many of Freud\u2019s theories, this particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to\nexperimental tests (Person, 1980).\nMorerecently,thestudyofpersonalityhastakenonamorequantitativeapproach.Ratherthanexplaining\nhow personality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and\ndetermining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in\nany given situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and\nmanyhaveproposedthatfivetraitdimensionsaresufficienttocapturethevariationsinpersonalityseen\nacross individuals. These five dimensions are known as the \u201cBig Five\u201d or the Five Factor model, and\nincludedimensionsofconscientiousness,agreeableness,neuroticism,openness,andextraversion(Figure\n1.14). Each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen,\nMets\u00e4pelto, Feldt, Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is\ninfluenced by genetics (e.g., Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996). 22 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nFigure 1.14 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description would\ndescribe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given dimension\ncould be described in opposite terms.\nSOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY\nSocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct\nresearchonawidevarietyoftopicsthatincludedifferencesinhowweexplainourownbehaviorversus\nhow we explain the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal\nconflicts.Socialpsychologistshavealsosoughttodeterminehowbeingamongotherpeoplechangesour\nown behavior and patterns of thinking.\nThere are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of\ntheseinalaterchapterofthistextbook.Untilthen,youwillbeintroducedtooneofthemostcontroversial\npsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is\nmost famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war\ncriminal,AdolfEichmann,whowasaccusedofcommittingmassatrocities,wasputontrial.Manypeople\nwondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they\nwere unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the\ntime, most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and\nsuffering, simply because they were obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine\nwhether or not this was true (Figure 1.15). As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly\ntwo-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology 23\nperson,simplybecausetheywereinstructedtodosobyanauthorityfigure(inthiscase,amandressedin\nalabcoat).Thiswasinspiteofthefactthatparticipantsreceivedpaymentforsimplyshowingupforthe\nresearchstudyandcouldhavechosennottoinflictpainormoreseriousconsequencesonanotherperson\nbywithdrawing from thestudy.

This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.\nINDUSTRIAL-ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY\nIndustrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies\npsychological theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O\npsychologists are often involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure,\nand workplace environment. Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring\ndecisions as well as to create an environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and\nefficiency.Inadditiontoitsappliednature,I-Opsychologyalsoinvolvesconductingscientificresearchon\nbehavior within I-O settings (Riggio, 2013). 24 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY\nHealth psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological, psychological, and\nsociocultural factors. This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.16).\nHealth psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy,\neducation, intervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the\nrelationship between one\u2019s genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress,\nand health. They may research effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that\ncontribute to poorer health (MacDonald, 2013).\nFigure 1.16 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these three\nfactors.\nSPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY\nResearchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,\nincluding motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional\nwellbeing.

Thus,\npsychologyisdefinedasthescientificstudyofmindandbehavior.Studentsofpsychologydevelopcritical\nthinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.\n1.2History of Psychology\nBefore the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers.\nHowever,bothWundtandJameshelpedcreatepsychologyasadistinctscientificdiscipline.Wundtwasa\nstructuralist,whichmeanthebelievedthatourcognitiveexperiencewasbestunderstoodbybreakingthat\nexperience into its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.\nWilliam James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This\nparticular perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism\u2019s\nenvironment. Like Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also\nincorporated more objective measures as well.\nSigmundFreudbelievedthatunderstandingtheunconscious mindwasabsolutelycriticaltounderstand\nconscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various\nhysteriasandneuroses.Freudreliedondreamanalysis,slipsofthetongue,andfreeassociationasmeans\nto access the unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for\nseveral decades.\nGestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an\nindividualandhisexperiences.AstheNaziscametopowerinGermany,Wertheimer,Koffka,andK\u00f6hler\nimmigratedtotheUnitedStates.Althoughtheylefttheirlaboratoriesandtheirresearchbehind,theydid\nintroduce America toGestaltideas.Some oftheprinciplesofGestaltpsychology arestillveryinfluential\nin the study of sensation and perception.\nOneofthemostinfluentialschoolsofthoughtwithinpsychology\u2019shistorywasbehaviorism.Behaviorism\nfocused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the\nimportanceofunobservablementalprocesses.JohnWatsonisoftenconsideredthefatherofbehaviorism,\nand B. F. Skinner\u2019s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be\nunderestimated.\nAs behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to\nbecome dissatisfied with psychology\u2019s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within\npsychology began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow\nand Rogers were influential in shaping humanistic psychology.\nDuringthe1950s,thelandscapeofpsychologybegantochange.Ascienceofbehaviorbegantoshiftback\ntoitsrootsoffocusonmentalprocesses.Theemergenceofneuroscienceandcomputerscienceaidedthis\ntransition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was\ncrucial to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.\n1.3Contemporary Psychology\nPsychologyisadiversedisciplinethatismadeupofseveralmajorsubdivisionswithuniqueperspectives. 32 Chapter 1 | Introduction to Psychology\nBiological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception\nrefer to the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is\nreceived, and how this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around\nus. Cognitive psychology is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior,\nand developmental psychologists study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one\u2019s\nlifespan. Personality psychology focuses on individuals\u2019 unique patterns of behavior, thought, and\nemotion. Industrial and organizational psychology, health psychology, sport and exercise psychology,\nforensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial\nandorganizational psychologists applypsychological concepts toI-Osettings.

At various\ntimes in history, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth\u2019s\ncontinents did not move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2).

Scientific knowledge is empirical:It is grounded inobjective, tangible evidence that can\nbe observed time and time again, regardless of who is observing.\nWhile behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the\nreason for the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain,\nor happy? Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone\u2019s behavior by simply asking a question, like\n\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or\nunwilling to answer the question honestly, or is incapable of answering.

More than ever before, we have an incredible\namount of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might\nresult in a number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community\ngoing through the process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus\nemerges. For example, the hypothesized link between exposure to media violence and subsequent\naggression has been debated in the scientific community for roughly 60 years. Even today, we will find\ndetractors,butaconsensusisbuilding.Severalprofessionalorganizationsviewmediaviolenceexposure\nasariskfactorforactualviolence,includingtheAmericanMedicalAssociation,theAmericanPsychiatric\nAssociation, and the American Psychological Association (American Academy of Pediatrics, American\nAcademy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, American Psychological Association, American Medical\nAssociation, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Psychiatric Association, 2000).\nIn the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a\ndegreeofhealthyskepticism.Whensomeonemakesaclaim,weshouldexaminetheclaimfromanumber\nofdifferentperspectives:whatistheexpertiseofthepersonmakingtheclaim,whatmighttheygainifthe\nclaim is valid, does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of\ntheclaim?Thisisespeciallyimportantwhenweconsiderhowmuchinformationinadvertisingcampaigns\nandontheinternetclaimstobebasedon\u201cscientificevidence\u201dwheninactualityitisabelieforperspective\nof just a few individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.\nWe should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on\nthis information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public\npolicy. Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities\nis to manage the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents\u2019 tax dollars. As the\nnew governor, you need to decide whether to continue funding the D.A.R.E.

The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and\ninductive. In deductive reasoning, ideas are tested against the empirical world; in inductive reasoning,\nempirical observations lead to new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling\nandexhaling,butdifferentresearchapproachesplacedifferentemphasisonthedeductiveandinductive\naspects.\nFigure 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.\nIn the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization\u2014one hypothesis\u2014that is then\nused to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical\nconclusionsreachedthroughdeductivereasoningshouldalsobecorrect.Adeductivereasoningargument\nmightgosomethinglikethis:Alllivingthingsrequireenergytosurvive(thiswouldbeyourhypothesis).\nDucks are living things.

Sometimes, however, an incorrect\nhypothesismayleadtoalogicalbutincorrectconclusion.Considerthisargument:allducksarebornwith\nthe ability to see. Quackers is a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists\nuse deductive reasoning to empirically test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks,\nresearchers might design a study to test the hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive,\nthen ducks will be found to require energy to survive.\nDeductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,\ninductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to\nconstructbroadgeneralizations.Unlikedeductivereasoning,conclusionsdrawnfrominductivereasoning\nmayormaynotbecorrect,regardlessoftheobservationsonwhichtheyarebased.Forinstance,youmay\nnotice that your favorite fruits\u2014apples, bananas, and oranges\u2014all grow on trees; therefore, you assume\nthat all fruit must grow on trees.

In the end, science involves\nboth deductive and inductive processes.\nFor example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the\nside of empirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as\nresearchersgathermassiveamountsofobservationsandseekinterestingpatterns(newideas)inthedata.\nExperimental research, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPlay this\u201cDeal Me In\u201d interactive card game (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\ndealmein)to practice using inductive reasoning.\nWe\u2019vestatedthattheoriesandhypothesesareideas,butwhatsortofideasarethey,exactly?Atheoryisa\nwell-developedsetofideasthatproposeanexplanationforobservedphenomena.Theoriesarerepeatedly\nchecked against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers\ncreate hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.\nA hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is\noften worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The\nhypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real\nworld. As specific hypotheses aretested, theories aremodified and refined to reflect and incorporate the\nresult of these testsFigure 2.5. 40 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nFigure 2.5 The scientific method of research includes proposing hypotheses, conducting research, and creating or\nmodifying theories based on results.\nTo see how this process works, let\u2019s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated\nfrom that theory. As you\u2019ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that\nemotionalexperiencereliesonthephysiologicalarousalassociatedwiththeemotionalstate.Ifyouwalked\nout of your home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would\nbegintoraceandyourstomachchurn.AccordingtotheJames-Langetheory,thesephysiologicalchanges\nwould result in your feeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a\nperson who is unaware of the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.\nA scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the\nintroductorychapterthatSigmundFreudhadlotsofinterestingideastoexplainvarioushumanbehaviors\n(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud\u2019s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable;\nforexample,itisimpossibletoimagineempiricalobservationsthatwoulddisprovetheexistenceoftheid,\nthe ego, and the superego\u2014the three elements of personality described in Freud\u2019s theories.

In broader strokes, his views set\nthe stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of psychological\nprocesses.\nIn contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described\nabove. Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the\nbodily changes that often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by\ndetermining how emotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these\nchangesintheirphysiologicalarousalandthosewhodonot.Infact,thisresearchhasbeenconductedand\nwhiletheemotionalexperiencesofpeopledeprivedofanawarenessoftheirphysiologicalarousalmaybe\nless intense, they still experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).\nScientific research\u2019s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it\nproduces.

Some methods rely\non observational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the\nindividuals who are being studied\u2014ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth\ninterviews\u2014to well-controlled experiments.\nEach of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be\nappropriateforcertaintypesofresearchquestions.Forexample,studiesthatrelyprimarilyonobservation\nproduce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger\npopulation is somewhat limited because of small sample sizes.

While this can be a fairly inexpensive\nway to collect data that can provide insight into a number of research questions, researchers using this\napproach have no control on how or what kind of data was collected.

In\nexperimental research, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of\ncontrol over variables of interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in\nvery artificial settings. This calls into question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how\ntheywouldapplyinreal-worldsettings.Inaddition,manyofthequestionsthatpsychologistswouldlike\nto answer cannot be pursued through experimental research because of ethical concerns.\nCLINICAL OR CASE STUDIES\nIn 2011,theNew York Times published afeaturestory on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.\nTheseparticulartwinsareuniquebecauseKristaandTatianaareconjoinedtwins,connectedatthehead.\nThere is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is\na major sensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before\nreaching higher regions of the cerebral cortex for processing.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research 43\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo learn more about Krista and Tatiana, watch thisNew York Times video\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hogans)about their lives.\nTheimplicationsofthispotentialconnectionmeanthatitmightbepossibleforonetwintoexperiencethe\nsensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program,\nTatiana might smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program.

However, people might change their behavior in unexpected\nwaysiftheyknowtheyarebeingobserved.Howdoresearchersobtainaccurateinformationwhenpeople\ntend to hide their natural behavior? As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your\nclasstoraisetheirhandiftheyalwayswashtheirhandsafterusingtherestroom.Chancesarethatalmost\neveryone in the classroom will raise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the\nrestroom is really that universal?\nThis is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feel\ncomfortable answering a question honestly. But if we are committed to finding out the facts about hand\nwashing, we have other options available to us.\nSuppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands\nafter using the restroom. Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white\nlab coat, sitting with a clipboard, and staring at the sinks? We want our researcher to be\ninconspicuous\u2014perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly 44 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nrecording the relevant information. This type of observational study is called naturalistic observation:\nobserving behavior in its natural setting. To better understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger\ncollaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children\non a playground. How did the observers remain inconspicuous over the duration of the study? They\nequippedafewofthechildrenwithwirelessmicrophones(whichthechildrenquicklyforgotabout)and\nobservedwhiletakingnotesfromadistance.Also,thechildreninthatparticularpreschool(a\u201claboratory\npreschool\u201d) were accustomed to having observers on the playground (Fanger, Frankel, & Hazen, 2012).\nItiscriticalthattheobserverbeasunobtrusiveandasinconspicuousaspossible:whenpeopleknowthey\narebeingwatched,theyarelesslikelytobehavenaturally.Ifyouhaveanydoubtaboutthis,askyourself\nhow your driving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a\ndesertedhighwayduringthemiddleoftheday;inthesecondsituation,youarebeingfollowedbyapolice\ncar down the same deserted highway (Figure 2.7).\nFigure 2.7 Seeing a police car behind you would probably affect your driving behavior. (credit: Michael Gil)\nItshouldbepointedoutthatnaturalisticobservationisnotlimitedtoresearchinvolvinghumans.Indeed,\nsome of the best-known examples of naturalistic observation involve researchers going into the field to\nobserve various kinds of animals in their own environments. As with human studies, the researchers\nmaintaintheirdistanceandavoidinterferingwiththeanimalsubjectssoasnottoinfluencetheirnatural\nbehaviors.Scientistshaveusedthistechniquetostudysocialhierarchiesandinteractionsamonganimals\nranging from ground squirrels to gorillas. The information provided by these studies is invaluable in\nunderstanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another. The\nanthropologist Jane Goodall, for example, spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of\nchimpanzees in Africa (Figure 2.8). As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might\nencounter in naturalistic observation, some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names\ninstead of referring to them by numbers\u2014using names was thought to undermine the emotional\ndetachment required for the objectivity of the study (McKie, 2010).\nFigure 2.8 (a) Jane Goodall made a career of conducting naturalistic observations of (b) chimpanzee behavior.\n(credit \u201cJane Goodall\u201d: modification of work by Erik Hersman; \u201cchimpanzee\u201d: modification of work by \u201cAfrika\nForce\u201d/Flickr.com)\nThe greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity, or accuracy, of information collected\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research 45\nunobtrusivelyinanaturalsetting.Havingindividualsbehaveastheynormallywouldinagivensituation\nmeans that we have a higher degree of ecological validity, or realism, than we might achieve with\nother research approaches. Therefore, our ability to generalize the findings of the research to real-world\nsituations is enhanced. If done correctly, we need not worry about people or animals modifying their\nbehavior simply because they are being observed. Sometimes, people may assume that reality programs\ngive us a glimpse into authentic human behavior. However, the principle of inconspicuous observation\nis violated as reality stars are followed by camera crews and are interviewed on camera for personal\nconfessionals. Given that environment, we must doubt how natural and realistic their behaviors are.\nThe major downside of naturalistic observation is that they are often difficult to set up and control. In\nourrestroomstudy,whatifyoustoodintherestroomalldaypreparedtorecordpeople\u2019shandwashing\nbehavior and no one came in? Or, what if you have been closely observing a troop of gorillas for weeks\nonlytofindthattheymigratedtoanewplacewhileyouweresleepinginyourtent?Thebenefitofrealistic\ndatacomesatacost.Asaresearcheryouhavenocontrolofwhen(orif)youhavebehaviortoobserve.In\naddition, thistypeofobservational researchoftenrequiressignificantinvestments oftime,money,anda\ngood dose of luck.\nSometimesstudiesinvolvestructuredobservation.Inthesecases,peopleareobservedwhileengagingin\nset,specifictasks.AnexcellentexampleofstructuredobservationcomesfromStrangeSituationbyMary\nAinsworth(youwillreadmoreaboutthisinthechapteronlifespandevelopment).TheStrangeSituationis\naprocedureusedtoevaluateattachmentstylesthatexistbetweenaninfantandcaregiver.Inthisscenario,\ncaregivers bring their infants into a room filled with toys. The Strange Situation involves a number of\nphases, including a stranger coming into the room, the caregiver leaving the room, and the caregiver\u2019s\nreturn to the room. The infant\u2019s behavior is closely monitored at each phase, but it is the behavior of the\ninfant upon being reunited with the caregiver that is most telling in terms of characterizing the infant\u2019s\nattachment style with the caregiver.\nAnother potential problem in observational research is observer bias. Generally, people who act as\nobservers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to\nfit their research goals or expectations. To protect against this type of bias, researchers should have clear\ncriteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified. In\naddition,researchersoftencompareobservationsofthesameeventbymultipleobservers,inordertotest\ninter-rater reliability: a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different\nobservers.\nSURVEYS\nOften, psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data. Surveys are lists of questions to be\nansweredbyresearchparticipants,andcanbedeliveredaspaper-and-pencilquestionnaires,administered\nelectronically,orconductedverbally(Figure 2.9).Generally,thesurveyitselfcanbecompletedinashort\ntime, and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people.\nSurveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research\nmethods. A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population, which is the overall group of\nindividualsthattheresearchersareinterestedin.Researchersstudythesampleandseektogeneralizetheir\nfindings to the population. 46 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nFigure 2.9 Surveys can be administered in a number of ways, including electronically administered research, like\nthe survey shown here.

By using surveys, we\ncancollectinformationfromalargersampleofpeople.Alargersampleisbetterabletoreflecttheactual\ndiversity of the population, thus allowing better generalizability.

For example, people may report drinking less alcohol than is actually the case.\nAnynumberofresearchquestionscanbeansweredthroughtheuseofsurveys.Onereal-worldexample\nis the research conducted by Jenkins, Ruppel, Kizer, Yehl, and Griffin (2012) about the backlash against\nthe US Arab-American community following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Jenkins and\ncolleagues wanted to determine to what extent these negative attitudes toward Arab-Americans still\nexisted nearly a decade after the attacks occurred. In one study, 140 research participants filled out a\nsurvey with 10 questions, including questions asking directly about the participant\u2019s overt prejudicial\nattitudestowardpeopleofvariousethnicities.Thesurveyalsoaskedindirectquestionsabouthowlikely\nthe participant would be to interact with a person of a given ethnicity in a variety of settings (such as,\n\u201cHowlikelydoyouthinkitisthatyouwouldintroduceyourselftoapersonofArab-Americandescent?\u201d).\nThe results of the research suggested that participants were unwilling to report prejudicial attitudes\ntowardanyethnicgroup.However,thereweresignificantdifferencesbetweentheirpatternofresponses\ntoquestionsaboutsocialinteractionwithArab-Americanscomparedtootherethnicgroups:theyindicated\nless willingness for social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to the other ethnic groups.

For\none, the researcher employing archival research never directly interacts with research participants.\nTherefore, the investment of time and money to collect data is considerably less with archival research.\nAdditionally, researchers have no control over what information was originally collected. Therefore,\nresearchquestionshavetobetailoredsotheycanbeansweredwithinthestructureoftheexistingdatasets.\nThere is also no guarantee of consistency between the records from one source to another, which might\nmake comparing and contrasting different data sets problematic.\nLONGITUDINAL AND CROSS-SECTIONAL RESEARCH\nSometimes we want to see how people change over time, as in studies of human development and\nlifespan. When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time, we\nareconductinglongitudinalresearch.Longitudinalresearchisaresearchdesigninwhichdata-gathering\nis administered repeatedly over an extended period of time.

Longitudinal research is a powerful approach because the\nsameindividualsareinvolvedintheresearchprojectovertime,whichmeansthattheresearchersneedto\nbe less concerned with differences among cohorts affecting the results of their study.\nOften longitudinal studies are employed when researching various diseases in an effort to understand 48 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nparticular risk factors. Such studies often involve tens of thousands of individuals who are followed\nfor several decades. Given the enormous number of people involved in these studies, researchers can\nfeel confident that their findings can be generalized to the larger population. The Cancer Prevention\nStudy-3(CPS-3)isoneofaseriesoflongitudinalstudiessponsoredbytheAmericanCancerSocietyaimed\nat determining predictive risk factors associated with cancer.

For instance, earlier\nlongitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society provided some of the first scientific\ndemonstrations of the now well-established links between increased rates of cancer and smoking\n(American Cancer Society, n.d.) (Figure 2.11).\nFigure 2.11 Longitudinal research like the CPS-3 help us to better understand how smoking is associated with\ncancer and other diseases. (credit: CDC/Debora Cartagena)\nAs with any research strategy, longitudinal research is not without limitations. For one, these studies\nrequire an incredible time investment by the researcher and research participants. Given that some\nlongitudinalstudiestakeyears,ifnotdecades,tocomplete,theresultswillnotbeknownforaconsiderable\nperiod of time. In addition to the time demands, these studies also require a substantial financial\ninvestment.

People move, get married and take new names, get ill, and eventually die.\nEven without significant life changes, some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation\nin the project.

There is no question that a relationship exists\nbetween ice cream and crime (e.g., Harper, 2013), but it would be pretty foolish to decide that one thing\nactually caused the other to occur.\nIt is much more likely that both ice cream sales and crime rates are related to the temperature outside.\nWhen the temperature is warm, there are lots of people out of their houses, interacting with each other,\ngettingannoyedwithoneanother,andsometimescommittingcrimes.Also,whenitiswarmoutside,we\nare more likely to seek a cool treat like ice cream. How do we determine if there is indeed a relationship\nbetween two things? And when there is a relationship, how can we discern whether it is attributable to\ncoincidence or causation?\nCORRELATIONAL RESEARCH\nCorrelation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables (such as ice cream\nconsumption and crime), but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect. When two\nvariablesarecorrelated,itsimplymeansthatasonevariablechanges,sodoestheother.Wecanmeasure\ncorrelation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient.

A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction. Put another\nway,itmeansthatasonevariableincreasessodoestheother,andconversely,whenonevariabledecreases\nso does the other. A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions. If two\nvariables are negatively correlated, a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other\nand vice versa.\nThe example of ice cream and crime rates is a positive correlation because both variables increase when 50 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\ntemperatures are warmer. Other examples of positive correlations are the relationship between an\nindividual\u2019s height and weight or the relationship between a person\u2019s age and number of wrinkles.

The stronger the\ncorrelation, the closer the data points are to a straight line.

The ebb and flow of the 52 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nocean\u2019s tides are tightly tied to the gravitational forces of the moon. Many people believe, therefore, that\nit is logical that we are affected by the moon as well. After all, our bodies are largely made up of water.\nA meta-analysis of nearly 40 studies consistently demonstrated, however, that the relationship between\nthe moon and our behavior does not exist (Rotton & Kelly, 1985). While we may pay more attention to\noddbehaviorduringthefullphaseofthemoon,theratesofoddbehaviorremainconstantthroughoutthe\nlunar cycle.\nWhy are we so apt to believe in illusory correlations like this?

It is important for the control group to be treated\nsimilarly to the experimental group, with the exception that the control group does not receive the\nexperimental manipulation. Therefore, we have the control group watch non-violent television\nprogramming for the same amount of time as the experimental group.\nWe also need to precisely define, or operationalize, what is considered violent and nonviolent. An\noperational definition is a description of how we will measure our variables, and it is important in\nallowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment. In\noperationalizing violent behavior, we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching\nas instances of this behavior, or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges. Whatever we\ndetermine, it is important that we operationalize violent behavior in such a way that anyone who hears\nabout our study for the first time knows exactly what we mean by violence. This aids peoples\u2019 ability to\ninterpret our data as well as their capacity to repeat our experiment should they choose to do so.\nOncewehaveoperationalizedwhatisconsideredviolenttelevisionprogrammingandwhatisconsidered\nviolentbehaviorfromourexperimentparticipants,weneedtoestablishhowwewillrunourexperiment.\nIn this case, we might have participants watch a 30-minute television program (either violent or 54 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nnonviolent,dependingontheirgroupmembership)beforesendingthemouttoaplaygroundforanhour\nwhere their behavior is observed and the number and type of violent acts is recorded.\nIdeally, the people who observe and record the children\u2019s behavior are unaware of who was assigned to\nthe experimental or control group, in order to control for experimenter bias. Experimenter bias refers to\nthepossibilitythataresearcher\u2019sexpectationsmightskewtheresultsofthestudy.Remember,conducting\nan experiment requires a lot of planning, and the people involved in the research project have a vested\ninterest in supporting their hypotheses.

To\nachieve this, we must pay attention to two important variables, or things that can be changed, in any\nexperimental study: the independent variable and the dependent variable. An independent variable is\nmanipulated or controlled by the experimenter. In a well-designed experimental study, the independent\nvariable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups. In our example\nofhowviolenttelevisionprogramsaffectchildren\u2019sdisplayofviolentbehavior,theindependentvariable\nis the type of program\u2014violent or nonviolent\u2014viewed by participants in the study (Figure 2.17). A\ndependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable\nhad.Inourexample,thedependentvariableisthenumberofviolentactsdisplayedbytheexperimental\nparticipants.\nFigure 2.17 In an experiment, manipulations of the independent variable are expected to result in changes in the\ndependent variable. (credit \u201cautomatic weapon\u201d: modification of work by Daniel Oines; credit \u201ctoy gun\u201d: modification of\nwork by Emran Kassim)\nWe expect that the dependent variable will change as a function of the independent variable. In other\nwords, the dependent variable depends on the independent variable. A good way to think about the\nrelationship between the independent and dependent variables is with this question: What effect does\nthe independent variable have on the dependent variable? Returning to our example, what effect does\nwatchingahalfhourofviolenttelevisionprogrammingornonviolenttelevisionprogramminghaveonthe\nnumber of incidents of physical aggression displayed on the playground?\nSelecting and Assigning Experimental Participants\nNowthatourstudyisdesigned,weneedtoobtainasampleofindividualstoincludeinourexperiment.\nOur study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include. Participants are the\nsubjectsofpsychologicalresearch,andasthenameimplies,individualswhoareinvolvedinpsychological\nresearchactivelyparticipateintheprocess.Often,psychologicalresearchprojectsrelyoncollegestudents\nto serve as participants. In fact, the vast majority of research in psychology subfields has historically\ninvolved students as research participants (Sears, 1986; Arnett, 2008). But are college students truly 56 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nrepresentative of the general population? College students tend to be younger, more educated, more\nliberal, and less diverse than the general population. Although using students as test subjects is an\nacceptedpractice,relyingonsuchalimitedpoolofresearchparticipantscanbeproblematicbecauseitis\ndifficult to generalize findings to the larger population.\nOurhypotheticalexperimentinvolveschildren,andwemustfirstgenerateasampleofchildparticipants.\nSamples are used because populations are usually too large to reasonably involve every member in\nour particular experiment (Figure 2.18). If possible, we should use a random sample (there are other\ntypes of samples, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on random samples). A random\nsample is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance\nof being selected. Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be\nreasonablysurethattheparticipatingindividualsarerepresentativeofthelargerpopulation.Thismeans\nthat the percentages of characteristics in the sample\u2014sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other\ncharacteristics that might affect the results\u2014are close to those percentages in the larger population.\nIn our example, let\u2019s say we decide our population of interest is fourth graders. But all fourth graders\nis a very large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of\ninterestisallfourthgradersinaparticularcity.Weshouldincludestudentsfromvariousincomebrackets,\nfamily situations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town. With this more manageable\npopulation,wecanworkwiththelocalschoolsinselectingarandomsampleofaround200fourthgraders\nwho we want to participate in our experiment.\nIn summary, because we cannot test all of the fourth graders in a city, we want to find a group of about\n200thatreflectsthecompositionofthatcity.Witharepresentativegroup,wecangeneralizeourfindings\nto the larger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way.\nFigure 2.18 Researchers may work with (a) a large population or (b) a sample group that is a subset of the larger\npopulation. (credit \u201ccrowd\u201d: modification of work by James Cridland; credit \u201cstudents\u201d: modification of work by Laurie\nSullivan)\nNow that we have a sample, the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into\nexperimentalandcontrolgroupsthroughrandomassignment.Withrandomassignment,allparticipants\nhave an equal chance of being assigned to either group. There is statistical software that will randomly\nassign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group.\nRandom assignment is critical for sound experimental design. With sufficiently large samples, random\nassignmentmakesitunlikelythattherearesystematicdifferencesbetweenthegroups.So,forinstance,it\nwouldbeveryunlikelythatwewouldgetonegroupcomposedentirelyofmales,agivenethnicidentity,\noragivenreligiousideology.Thisisimportantbecauseifthegroupsweresystematicallydifferentbefore\ntheexperimentbegan,wewouldnotknowtheoriginofanydifferenceswefindbetweenthegroups:Were\nthe differences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable?

For instance, imagine that you want to know\nwhateffectsex(theindependentvariable)hasonspatialmemory(thedependentvariable).Althoughyou\ncancertainlylookfordifferencesbetweenmalesandfemalesonataskthattapsintospatialmemory,you\ncannotdirectlycontrolaperson\u2019ssex.Wecategorizethistypeofresearchapproachasquasi-experimental\nand recognize that we cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.\nExperimenters are also limited by ethical constraints. For instance, you would not be able to conduct an\nexperiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem\namong adults. To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental\nparticipants to a group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical.\nInterpreting Experimental Findings\nOnce data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups, a statistical analysis is\nconducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups. A statistical analysis\ndetermines how likely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful). In psychology,\ngroupdifferencesareconsideredmeaningful,orsignificant,iftheoddsthatthesedifferencesoccurredby\nchancealoneare5percentorless.Statedanotherway,ifwerepeatedthisexperiment100times,wewould\nexpect to find the same results at least 95 times out of 100.\nThegreateststrengthofexperimentsistheabilitytoassertthatanysignificantdifferencesinthefindings\nare caused by the independent variable.

The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes a manual detailing how to write\na paper for submission to scientific journals. Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine\nlike Psychology Today, which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology, scientific journals\ngenerallypublishpeer-reviewedjournalarticlesaimedatanaudienceofprofessionalsandscholarswho\nare actively involved in research themselves. 58 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheOnline Writing Lab (OWL) (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/owl)at Purdue\nUniversity can walk you through the APA writing guidelines.\nApeer-reviewedjournalarticleisreadbyseveralotherscientists(generallyanonymously)withexpertise\nin the subject matter.

Since the initial reports,\nlarge-scaleepidemiologicalresearchhassuggestedthatvaccinationsarenotresponsibleforcausingautism\nand that it is much safer to have your child vaccinated than not. Furthermore, several of the original studies\nmaking this claim have since been retracted.\nA published piece of work can be rescinded when data is called into question because of falsification,\nfabrication, or serious research design problems. Once rescinded, the scientific community is informed that\nthere are serious problems with the original publication. Retractions can be initiated by the researcher who\nled the study, by research collaborators, by the institution that employed the researcher, or by the editorial\nboard of the journal in which the article was originally published.

Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result. In the context of\npsychological research, this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in\nconsistent, reproducible ways.\nUnfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measured\nsomethingcorrectly.Toillustratethisconcept,considerakitchenscalethatwouldbeusedtomeasurethe\nweight of cereal that you eat in the morning. If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently\nunder- or overestimate the amount of cereal that\u2019s being measured. While the scale is highly reliable in\nproducing consistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same\nreading each time), those results are incorrect. This is where validity comes into play. Validity refers to\ntheextenttowhichagiveninstrumentortoolaccuratelymeasureswhatit\u2019ssupposedtomeasure.While\nany valid measure is by necessity reliable, the reverse is not necessarily true. Researchers strive to use\ninstruments that are both highly reliable and valid.\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\nHow Valid Is the SAT?\nStandardizedtestsliketheSATaresupposedtomeasureanindividual\u2019saptitudeforacollegeeducation,but\nhow reliable and valid are such tests? Research conducted by the College Board suggests that scores on\nthe SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students\u2019 GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw, Mattern, 60 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research\n& Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test\u2019s ability to effectively predict the GPA of\ncollege freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT for admission, this high\ndegree of predictive validity might be comforting.\nHowever, the emphasis placed on SAT scores in college admissions has generated some controversy on a\nnumberoffronts.Forone,someresearchersassertthattheSATisabiasedtestthatplacesminoritystudents\nat a disadvantage and unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices & Wilson,\n2010).Additionally,someresearchhassuggestedthatthepredictivevalidityoftheSATisgrosslyexaggerated\nin how well it is able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been suggested that\ntheSAT\u2019spredictivevaliditymaybeoverestimatedbyasmuchas150%(Rothstein,2004).Manyinstitutions\nof higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in making\nadmission decisions (Rimer, 2008).\nIn 2014, College Board president David Coleman expressed his awareness of these problems, recognizing\nthatcollegesuccessismoreaccuratelypredictedbyhighschoolgradesthanbySATscores.Toaddressthese\nconcerns, he has called for significant changes to the SAT exam (Lewin, 2014).\n2.4 Ethics\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated\n\u2022 Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing\n\u2022 Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated\nToday,scientistsagreethatgoodresearchisethicalinnatureandisguidedbyabasicrespectforhuman\ndignityandsafety.However,asyouwillreadinthefeaturebox,thishasnotalwaysbeenthecase.Modern\nresearchersmustdemonstratethattheresearchtheyperformisethicallysound.Thissectionpresentshow\nethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.\nRESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS\nAnyexperimentinvolvingtheparticipationofhumansubjectsisgovernedbyextensive,strictguidelines\ndesigned to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm.

The purpose of the IRB is to review\nproposals for research that involves human participants.

While\nthisapproach provides anincredible depthofinformation, theabilitytogeneralizetheseobservations to\nthe larger population is problematic.

However,\nnaturalisticobservationdoesnotallowformuchcontrolandoftenrequiresquiteabitoftimeandmoney\ntoperform.Researchersstrivetoensurethattheirtoolsforcollectingdataarebothreliable(consistentand\nreplicable) and valid (accurate).\nSurveys can be administered in a number of ways and make it possible to collect large amounts of data\nquickly.

Cross-sectional research compares multiple segments of a population at a single time.\n2.3Analyzing Findings\nA correlation is described with a correlation coefficient, r, which ranges from -1 to 1. The correlation\ncoefficient tells us about the nature (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between\ntwo or more variables. Correlations do not tell us anything about causation\u2014regardless of how strong\nthe relationship is between variables. In fact, the only way to demonstrate causation is by conducting an\nexperiment. People often make the mistake of claiming that correlations exist when they really do not.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 2 | Psychological Research 67\nResearchers can test cause-and-effect hypotheses by conducting experiments. Ideally, experimental\nparticipants are randomly selected from the population of interest. Then, the participants are randomly\nassigned to their respective groups. Sometimes, the researcher and the participants are blind to group\nmembership to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.\nInidealexperimentaldesign,theonlydifferencebetweentheexperimentalandcontrolgroupsiswhether\nparticipants are exposed to the experimental manipulation.

In parts of Africa where malaria\nis prevalent, having the sickle-cell mutation does provide health benefits for carriers (protection from\nmalaria).\nThis is precisely the situation that Charles Darwin describes in the theory of evolution by natural\nselection (Figure 3.3). In simple terms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their\nenvironment will survive and reproduce, while those that are poorly suited for their environment will\ndie off.

How can we tell them apart?\nIn both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certain\npatterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior\nandcognitiveprocesseshaveevolvedovertime.Therefore,variationsincognitionandbehaviorwouldmake\nindividuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes to their offspring. Evolutionary\npsychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including\nfear response, food preferences, mate selection, and cooperative behaviors (Confer et al., 2010).\nWhereasevolutionarypsychologistsfocusonuniversalpatternsthatevolvedovermillionsofyears,behavioral\ngeneticists study how individual differences arise, in the present, through the interaction of genes and the\nenvironment. When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies\nto research questions of interest. Twin studies compare the rates that a given behavioral trait is shared\namongidenticalandfraternaltwins;adoptionstudiescomparethoseratesamongbiologicallyrelatedrelatives\nand adopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and\nenvironment for the expression of a given trait.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisinterview (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/buss)with renowned\nevolutionary psychologistDavis Buss for an explanation of how a psychologist\napproaches evolution and how this approach fits within the field of social science.\nGENETIC VARIATION\nGeneticvariation,thegeneticdifferencebetweenindividuals,iswhatcontributestoaspecies\u2019adaptation\nto its environment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and\nfertilization.Fertilewomenovulateroughlyoncepermonth,releasinganeggfromfolliclesintheovary.\nDuringtheegg'sjourneyfromtheovarythroughthefallopiantubes,totheuterus,aspermmayfertilize\nan egg.\nTheeggandthespermeachcontain23chromosomes.Chromosomesarelongstringsofgeneticmaterial\nknown as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base\npairs. In each chromosome, sequences of DNA make upgenes thatcontrol or partiallycontrol anumber\nofvisiblecharacteristics,knownastraits,suchaseyecolor,haircolor,andsoon.Asinglegenemayhave\nmultiplepossiblevariations,oralleles.Analleleisaspecificversionofagene.So,agivengenemaycode\nfor the trait of hair color, and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has.\nWhen a sperm and egg fuse, their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of\nchromosomes.Therefore,eachparentcontributeshalfthegeneticinformationcarriedbytheoffspring;the\nresultingphysicalcharacteristicsoftheoffspring(calledthephenotype)aredeterminedbytheinteraction\nof genetic material supplied by the parents (called the genotype). A person\u2019s genotype is the genetic\nmakeup of that individual. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the individual\u2019s inherited physical\ncharacteristics, which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences (Figure 3.4).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology 77\nFigure 3.4 (a) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material (DNA) inherited\nfrom one\u2019s parents. (b) Phenotype describes an individual\u2019s observable characteristics, such as hair color, skin color,\nheight, and build. (credit a: modification of work by Caroline Davis; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nMost traits are controlled by multiple genes, but some traits are controlled by one gene. A characteristic\nlike cleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent. In this example, we will call\nthegeneforcleftchin\u201cB,\u201dandthegeneforsmoothchin\u201cb.\u201dCleftchinisadominanttrait,whichmeans\nthathavingthedominantalleleeitherfromoneparent(Bb)orbothparents(BB)willalwaysresultinthe\nphenotypeassociatedwiththedominantallele.Whensomeonehastwocopiesofthesameallele,theyare\nsaidtobehomozygous forthatallele.Whensomeone hasacombination ofallelesforagivengene,they\naresaidtobeheterozygous.Forexample,smoothchinisarecessivetrait,whichmeansthatanindividual\nwill only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for thatrecessive allele(bb).\nImaginethatawomanwithacleftchinmateswithamanwithasmoothchin.Whattypeofchinwilltheir\nchildhave?Theanswertothatdependsonwhichalleleseachparentcarries.Ifthewomanishomozygous\nfor cleft chin (BB), her offspring will always have cleft chin.

The\ncapital B represents the dominant allele, and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele. In the example of the\ncleft chin, where B is cleft chin (dominant allele), wherever a pair contains the dominant allele, B, you can expect a\ncleft chin phenotype. You can expect a smooth chin phenotype only when there are two copies of the recessive allele,\nbb. (b) A cleft chin, shown here, is an inherited trait.\nSickle-cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes.\nFor example, phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally\nconverts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts. If someone with this condition goes untreated,\nhe or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and increased risk of various 78 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology\npsychiatric disorders. Because PKU is a recessive trait, each parent must have at least one copy of the\nrecessive allele in order to produce a child with the condition (Figure 3.6).\nSo far, we have discussed traits that involve just one gene, but few human characteristics are controlled\nbyasinglegene.Mosttraitsarepolygenic:controlledbymorethanonegene.Heightisoneexampleofa\npolygenic trait, as are skin color and weight.\nFigure 3.6 In thisPunnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is\nassociated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their\noffspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.\nWhere do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from?

Stated simply, our genes influence our environment, and our environment\ninfluences the expression of our genes (Figure 3.7). Not only do our genes and environment interact,\nas in range of reaction, but they also influence one another bidirectionally. For example, the child of an\nNBA player would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age. Such exposure might allow the\nchild to realize his or her full genetic, athletic potential. Thus, the parents\u2019 genes, which the child shares,\ninfluence the child\u2019s environment, and that environment, in turn, is well suited to support the child\u2019s\ngenetic potential.\nFigure 3.7 Nature and nurture work together like complex pieces of a human puzzle.

Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to\na number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to\nspirituality(forexamples,seeMustanskietal.,2005;Comings,Gonzales,Saucier,Johnson,&MacMurray,\n2000).

Learning how\nthe cells and organs (like the brain) function, help us understand the biological basis behind human\npsychology. The nervous system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and\nneurons. Glial cells, which outnumber neurons ten to one, are traditionally thought to play a supportive\nrole to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous\nsystem is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication, provide\ninsulationtoneurons,transportnutrientsandwasteproducts,andmediateimmuneresponses.Neurons,\nontheotherhand,serveasinterconnectedinformationprocessors thatareessentialforallofthetasksof\nthe nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.\nNEURON STRUCTURE\nNeurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,\nneurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron\u2019s\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology 81\nouter surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules\nand molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged\nmolecules.\nFigure 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated.\nThenucleusoftheneuronislocatedinthesoma,orcellbody.Thesomahasbranchingextensionsknown\nasdendrites.Theneuronisasmallinformationprocessor,anddendritesserveasinputsiteswheresignals\nare received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a\nmajorextensionfromthesomaknownastheaxon,whichendsatmultipleterminalbuttons.Theterminal\nbuttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous\nsystem.\nAxons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty\nsubstance known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the\nspeed at which the signal travels. The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons\nwithinthenervoussystem:thelossoftheinsulationitprovidescanbedetrimentaltonormalfunction.To\nunderstandhowthisworks,let\u2019sconsideranexample.Multiplesclerosis(MS),anautoimmunedisorder,\ninvolves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout the nervous system. The resulting\ninterferenceintheelectricalsignalpreventsthequicktransmittalofinformationbyneuronsandcanlead\ntoanumberofsymptoms,suchasdizziness,fatigue,lossofmotorcontrol,andsexualdysfunction.While\nsome treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and manage certain symptoms, there is\ncurrently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.\nIn healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where\nsynaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse (Figure 3.9). The synapse is a very small\nspace between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.\nOnce neurotransmitters are released into the synapse, they travel across the small space and bind with\ncorresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface\nwhere neurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes \u201cmatching\u201d different\nneurotransmitters.\nHow does a neurotransmitter \u201cknow\u201d which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor\nhave what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship\u2014specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors\nsimilar to how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits. 82 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology\nFigure 3.9 (a) The synapse is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of another\nneuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green) has been\nopened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000 neurotransmitter\nmolecules.

The neuron exists in a fluid environment\u2014it is surrounded by\nextracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these\ntwo fluids separate\u2014a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends\non the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the\nmembrane, called themembrane potential, provides energy for the signal.\nThe electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The\nsemipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged\nmolecules,and,asaresult,someofthechargedparticlestendtobecomemoreconcentratedeitherinside\nor outside the cell.\nBetween signals, the neuron membrane\u2019s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting\npotential. Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side\nofthecellmembrane,readytorushacrossthemembranewhentheneurongoesactiveandthemembrane\nopensitsgates(i.e.,asodium-potassiumpumpthatallowsmovementofionsacrossthemembrane).Ions\nin high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to\nmove to areas with a negative charge.\nIntherestingstate,sodium(Na+)isathigherconcentrations outsidethecell,soitwilltendtomoveinto\nthecell.Potassium(K+),ontheotherhand,ismoreconcentratedinsidethecell,andwilltendtomoveout\nofthecell(Figure 3.10).Inaddition, theinside ofthecellisslightlynegativelycharged compared tothe\noutside.

Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged\nproteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge\nin the intracellular fluid.\nFrom this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure\n3.11).Whenaneuronreceivessignalsatthedendrites\u2014duetoneurotransmittersfromanadjacentneuron\nbinding to its receptors\u2014small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions,\npropelledbybothchargeandconcentrationdifferences,tomoveintothecell.Withthisinfluxofpositive\nions,theinternalchargeofthecellbecomesmorepositive.Ifthatchargereachesacertainlevel,calledthe\nthreshold of excitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.\nMany additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the\nmembrane potential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the\npotassiumgatesopen.Aspositivelychargedpotassiumionsleave,thecellquicklybeginsrepolarization.\nAt first, it hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels\noff, returning to the resting potential.\nFigure 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.\nThispositivespikeconstitutestheactionpotential:theelectricalsignalthattypicallymovesfromthecell\nbodydowntheaxontotheaxonterminals.Theelectricalsignalmovesdowntheaxonlikeawave;ateach\npoint,someofthesodiumionsthatenterthecelldiffusetothenextsectionoftheaxon,raisingthecharge\npastthethresholdofexcitationandtriggeringanewinfluxofsodiumions.Theactionpotentialmovesall 84 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology\nthe way down the axon to the terminal buttons.\nThe action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon.

The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to\nreceptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron\n(assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered,\nexcess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are\nreabsorbed in a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped\nback into the neuron that released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse\nserves both to provide a clear \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d state between signals and to regulate the production of\nneurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be\nproduced).\nFigure 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from which\nit was released.\nNeuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event.

Much\nof what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects\nof drugs in psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the\nphysiologicalcausesofbehaviorassertthatpsychologicaldisorderslikedepressionandschizophreniaare\nassociated with imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic\nmedications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications\nare drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.\nTable 3.1Major Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior\nNeurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior\nAcetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced\ncognition\nBeta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased\ntension\nDopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed\nappetite\nGamma-aminobutyric acid Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased\n(GABA) tension\nGlutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced\nmemory\nNorepinephrine Heart, intestines, Increased arousal, suppressed\nalertness appetite\nSerotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed\nappetite\nPsychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system.

Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron\nfrom signaling information to adjacent neurons.\nIncontrasttoagonistsandantagonists,whichbothoperatebybindingtoreceptorsites,reuptakeinhibitors\nprevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This leaves more\nneurotransmitters in the synapse for a longer time, increasing its effects. Depression, which has been\nconsistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more time\nto interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,\nPaxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons\nand receptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from\npsychological disorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing\nimprovement, and many psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects.

The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the\nautonomic nervous system.\nThe somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or\nvoluntary. It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore,\nit consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to\nthemuscles,areefferentfibers(efferentmeans\u201cmovingawayfrom\u201d).Sensoryneurons,carryingsensory\ninformation to the CNS, are afferent fibers (afferent means \u201cmoving toward\u201d). Each nerve is basically a\ntwo-way superhighway, containing thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.\nThe autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered\nto be outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic divisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the\nbody for stress-related activities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the\nbody to routine, day-to-day operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in\ntandem to maintain the body\u2019s homeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, in which biological\nconditions (such as body temperature) are maintained at optimal levels. 88 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology\nFigure 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite\neffects on various systems.\nThesympatheticnervoussystemisactivatedwhenwearefacedwithstressfulorhigh-arousalsituations.\nThe activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival.

The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath\nthecortex(calledsubcorticalstructures):thalamus,hypothalamus,pituitarygland,andthelimbicsystem\n(collection of structures). The cerebral cortex, which is the outer surface of the brain, is associated with\nhigher level processes such as consciousness, thought, emotion, reasoning, language, and memory. Each\ncerebral hemisphere can be subdivided into four lobes, each associated with different functions. 92 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology\nFigure 3.17 The brain and its parts can be divided into three main categories: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.\nLobes of the Brain\nThefourlobesofthebrainarethefrontal,parietal,temporal,andoccipitallobes(Figure3.18).Thefrontal\nlobeislocatedintheforwardpartofthebrain,extendingbacktoafissureknownasthecentralsulcus.The\nfrontallobeisinvolvedinreasoning,motorcontrol,emotion,andlanguage.Itcontainsthemotorcortex,\nwhichisinvolvedinplanningandcoordinatingmovement;theprefrontalcortex,whichisresponsiblefor\nhigher-level cognitive functioning; andBroca\u2019s area, which is essential for language production.\nFigure 3.18 The lobes of the brain are shown.\nPeople who suffer damage to Broca\u2019s area have great difficulty producing language of any form (Figure\n3.18). For example, Padma was an electrical engineer who was socially active and a caring, involved\nmother. About twenty years ago, she was in a car accident and suffered damage to her Broca\u2019s area. She\ncompletely lost the ability to speak and form any kind of meaningful language.

Gage's case occurred in the midst of a 19th century debate over\nlocalization\u2014regardingwhethercertainareasofthebrainareassociatedwithparticularfunctions.Onthe\nbasisofextremelylimitedinformationaboutGage,theextentofhisinjury,andhislifebeforeandafterthe\naccident, scientists tended to find support for their own views, on whichever side of the debate they fell\n(Macmillan, 1999).\nFigure 3.19 (a) PhineasGageholds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad construction accident.\n(b) Gage\u2019s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere.

The auditory cortex, the main area\nresponsible for processing auditory information, is located within the temporal lobe. Wernicke\u2019s area,\nimportant for speech comprehension, is also located here. Whereas individuals with damage to Broca\u2019s\narea have difficulty producing language, those with damage to Wernicke\u2019s area can produce sensible\nlanguage, but they are unable to understand it (Figure 3.21).\nFigure 3.21 Damage to either Broca\u2019s area or Wernicke\u2019s area can result in language deficits. The types of deficits\nare very different, however, depending on which area is affected.\nTheoccipitallobeislocatedattheverybackofthebrain,andcontainstheprimaryvisualcortex,whichis\nresponsibleforinterpretingincomingvisualinformation.Theoccipitalcortexisorganizedretinotopically,\nwhich means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person\u2019s visual field and\nthe position of that object\u2019s representation on the cortex. You will learn much more about how visual\ninformation is processed in the occipital lobe when you study sensation and perception.\nOther Areas of the Forebrain\nOther areas of the forebrain, located beneath the cerebral cortex, include the thalamus and the limbic\nsystem. The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain. All of our senses, with the exception of smell, are\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology 95\nroutedthroughthethalamusbeforebeingdirectedtootherareasofthebrainforprocessing(Figure3.22).\nFigure 3.22 The thalamus serves as the relay center of the brain where most senses are routed for processing.\nThe limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory. Interestingly, the sense of smell\nprojects directly to the limbic system; therefore, not surprisingly, smell can evoke emotional responses\nin ways that other sensory modalities cannot. The limbic system is made up of a number of different\nstructures, but three of the most important are the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus\n(Figure 3.23). The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory. The amygdala is\ninvolved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories. The\nhypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes, including the regulation of body\ntemperature, appetite, and blood pressure. The hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the\nnervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior.\nFigure 3.23 The limbic system is involved in mediating emotional response and memory.\nThe Case of Henry Molaison (H.M.)\nIn 1953, Henry Gustav Molaison (H. M.) was a 27-year-old man who experienced severe seizures. In\nan attempt to control his seizures, H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and\namygdala. Following the surgery, H.M\u2019s seizures became much less severe, but he also suffered some 96 Chapter 3 | Biopsychology\nunexpected\u2014anddevastating\u2014consequencesofthesurgery:helosthisabilitytoformmanytypesofnew\nmemories.Forexample,hewasunabletolearnnewfacts,suchaswhowaspresidentoftheUnitedStates.\nHewasabletolearnnewskills,butafterwardhehadnorecollectionoflearningthem.Forexample,while\nhemightlearntouseacomputer,hewouldhavenoconsciousmemoryofeverhavingusedone.Hecould\nnot remember new faces, and he was unable to remember events, even immediately after they occurred.\nResearchers were fascinated by his experience, and he is considered one of the most studied cases in\nmedical and psychological history (Hardt, Einarsson, & Nader, 2010; Squire, 2009). Indeed, his case has\nprovidedtremendousinsightintotherolethatthehippocampusplaysintheconsolidationofnewlearning\ninto explicit memory.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClive Wearing, an accomplished musician, lost the ability to form new memories\nwhen his hippocampus was damaged through illness. Check out the first few\nminutes of thisdocumentary video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/wearing)for an\nintroduction to this man and his condition.\nMIDBRAIN AND HINDBRAIN STRUCTURES\nThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain, between the forebrain and the\nhindbrain.Thereticularformationiscenteredinthemidbrain,butitactuallyextendsupintotheforebrain\nand down into the hindbrain. The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep/wake cycle,\narousal, alertness, and motor activity.\nThesubstantianigra(Latinfor\u201cblacksubstance\u201d)andtheventraltegmentalarea(VTA)arealsolocated\nin the midbrain (Figure 3.24).

The medulla, pons, and midbrain together are known\nas the brainstem.\nFigure 3.25 The pons, medulla, and cerebellum make up the hindbrain.\nThe cerebellum (Latin for \u201clittle brain\u201d) receives messages from muscles, tendons, joints, and structures\nin our ear to control balance, coordination, movement, and motor skills. The cerebellum is also thought\nto be an important area for processing some types of memories. In particular, procedural memory, or\nmemoryinvolvedinlearningandrememberinghowtoperformtasks,isthoughttobeassociatedwiththe\ncerebellum. Recall that H. M. was unable to form new explicit memories, but he could learn new tasks.\nThis is likely due to the fact that H.

While glia generally play\nsupporting roles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated\nwith the nervous system. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron\u2019s specialized\nstructures. The soma contains the cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like\nbranches.Theaxonisanothermajorextensionofthecellbody;axonsareoftencoveredbyamyelinsheath,\nwhichincreasesthespeedoftransmissionofneuralimpulses.Attheendoftheaxonareterminalbuttons\nthat contain synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters.\nNeuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for\nneurotransmitters releasedbynearbyneurons.Ifthesignalsreceivedfromotherneuronsaresufficiently\nstrong,anactionpotentialwilltraveldownthelengthoftheaxontotheterminalbuttons,resultinginthe\nrelease of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and\ninvolve the movement of Na+and K+across the neuronal membrane.\nDifferentneurotransmittersareassociatedwithdifferentfunctions.Often,psychologicaldisordersinvolve\nimbalancesinagivenneurotransmittersystem.Therefore,psychotropicdrugsareprescribedinanattempt\nto bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a\ngiven neurotransmitter system.\n3.3Parts of the Nervous System\nThe brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is\ncomprisedofthesomaticandautonomicnervoussystems.Thesomaticnervoussystemtransmitssensory\nand motor signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the\nfunctionofourorgansandglands,andcanbedividedintothesympatheticandparasympatheticdivisions.\nSympatheticactivationpreparesusforfightorflight,whileparasympatheticactivationisassociatedwith\nnormal functioning under relaxed conditions.\n3.4The Brain and Spinal Cord\nThe brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere\ncan be subdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes\nofthecerebralcortex,theforebrainincludesthethalamus(sensoryrelay)andlimbicsystem(emotionand\nmemorycircuit).Themidbraincontainsthereticularformation,whichisimportantforsleepandarousal,\naswellasthesubstantianigraandventraltegmentalarea.Thesestructuresareimportantformovement,\nreward, and addictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons,\nand midbrain), which control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also\ncontains the cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.\nIndividuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of\ndifferent areas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by\nimaging brain structure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.\n3.5The Endocrine System\nThe glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions.

Melatonin release is stimulated by\ndarkness and inhibited by light.\nThere are individual differences with regards to our sleep-wake cycle. For instance, some people would\nsaytheyaremorningpeople,whileotherswouldconsiderthemselvestobenightowls.Theseindividual\ndifferences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person\u2019s chronotype, and research\ndemonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip,\nCoste,Sagaspe,&Bioulac,2003).Sleepregulationreferstothebrain\u2019scontrolofswitchingbetweensleep\nand wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this briefvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/circadian)describing circadian\nrhythms and how they affect sleep.\nDisruptions of Normal Sleep\nWhetherlark,owl,orsomewhereinbetween,therearesituationsinwhichaperson\u2019scircadianclockgets\nout of synchrony with the external environment.

For example, a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.\non Tuesday, and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday. In such instances, the individual\u2019s schedule\nchanges so frequently that it becomes difficult for a normal circadian rhythm to be maintained.

Homeostatic regulation of sleep is\nevidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-\ndeprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for\nsleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using\nelectroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well\n(Figure 4.6).\nFigure 4.6 This is a segment of a polysonograph (PSG), a recording of several physical variables during sleep. The\nx-axis shows passage of time in seconds; this record includes 30 seconds of data. The location of the sets of\nelectrode that produced each signal is labeled on they-axis. The red box encompasses EEG output, and the\nwaveforms are characteristic of a specific stage of sleep. Other curves show other sleep-related data, such as body\ntemperature, muscle activity, and heartbeat.\nSleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another.\nSome of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the\nhypothalamus contains the SCN\u2014the biological clock of the body\u2014in addition to other nuclei that, in\nconjunctionwiththethalamus,regulateslow-wavesleep.Theponsisimportantforregulatingrapideye\nmovement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).\nSleepisalsoassociatedwiththesecretionandregulationofanumberofhormonesfromseveralendocrine\nglands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth\nhormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).

Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to\nexplain the function of sleep.\nAdaptive Function of Sleep\nOne popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary\npsychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have\nevolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior\nmake individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One\nhypothesisfromthisperspectivemightarguethatsleepisessentialtorestoreresourcesthatareexpended\nduring the day. Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at\nnight to reduce their energy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little\nresearchthatsupportsthisexplanation.Infact,ithasbeensuggestedthatthereisnoreasontothinkthat\nenergeticdemandscouldnotbeaddressedwithperiodsofrestandinactivity(Frank,2006;Rialetal.,2007),\nandsomeresearchhasactuallyfoundanegativecorrelationbetweenenergeticdemandsandtheamount\nof time spent sleeping (Capellini, Barton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).\nAnother evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response\ntopredatoryrisks,whichincreaseindarkness.Thuswesleepinsafeareastoreducethechanceofharm.\nAgain, this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent\nextendedperiodsoftimeasleeptoreduceattentiontothemselvesfrompotentialpredators.Comparative\nresearch indicates, however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very\ncomplex and equivocal. Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer\nhours than other species (Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship\nbetween the amount of time a given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth,\nAmlaner, & Lima, 2006).\nIt is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have\nevolved different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have\ndiscussed the negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there\nare many benefits that are associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the 120 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness\nNational Sleep Foundation (n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving\nmood,andincreasingmotorcoordination,aswellasanumberofbenefitsrelatedtocognitionandmemory\nformation.\nCognitive Function of Sleep\nAnother theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep\u2019s importance for cognitive function and memory\nformation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation\nresults in disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our\nabilities to maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these\nimpairments become more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola,\n2007).Furthermore,slow-wavesleepafterlearninganewtaskcanimproveresultantperformanceonthat\ntask (Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation\n(Stickgold, 2005). Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand\nthat cramming all night for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this briefvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sleepdeprived)describing\nsleep deprivation in college students.\nHere\u2019s another briefvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sleeptips)describing\nsleep tips for college students.\nSleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicates that included among\nthese possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick, Harrison, Kanady,\n& Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn, Nusbaum, &\nMargoliash, 2003; G\u00f3mez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu, Payne,\nTitone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by\ncertain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this briefvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sleepmemory)describing the\nrelationship between sleep and memory.\n4.3 Stages of Sleep\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Differentiate between REM and non-REM sleep\n\u2022 Describe the differences between the four stages of non-REM sleep\n\u2022 Understand the role that REM and non-REM sleep play in learning and memory\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness 121\nSleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can\nbe differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage.\nThese changes in brain wave activity can be visualized using EEG and are distinguished from one\nanother by both the frequency and amplitude of brain waves (Figure 4.8). Sleep can be divided into\ntwo different general phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM)\nsleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM\nsleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is\nsubdividedintofourstagesdistinguishedfromeachotherandfromwakefulnessbycharacteristicpatterns\nofbrainwaves.ThefirstfourstagesofsleepareNREMsleep,whilethefifthandfinalstageofsleepisREM\nsleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and their associated patterns of brain\nwave activity.\nFigure 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. (credit \"sleeping\":\nmodification of work by Ryan Vaarsi)\nNREM STAGES OF SLEEP\nThefirst stage of NREM sleep isknown asstage 1sleep. Stage 1sleep isatransitional phase thatoccurs\nbetween wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is\na slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked\ndecrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.\nIn terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early\nportion of stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves, which are relatively low frequency (8\u201313Hz), high\namplitude patterns of electrical activity (waves) that become synchronized (Figure 4.9). This pattern of\nbrainwaveactivityresemblesthatofsomeonewhoisveryrelaxed,yetawake.Asanindividualcontinues\nthrough stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency\n(4\u20137Hz),higheramplitudebrainwavesthanalphawaves.Itisrelativelyeasytowakesomeonefromstage\n1 sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep. 122 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness\nFigure 4.9 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.\nAs we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate\nthe activity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles\n(Figure4.10).Asleepspindleisarapidburstofhigherfrequencybrainwavesthatmaybeimportantfor\nlearningandmemory(Fogel&Smith,2011;Poe,Walsh,&Bjorness,2010).Inaddition,theappearanceof\nK-complexesisoftenassociatedwithstage2sleep.AK-complexisaveryhighamplitudepatternofbrain\nactivitythatmayinsomecasesoccurinresponsetoenvironmentalstimuli.Thus,K-complexesmightserve\nasabridgetohigherlevelsofarousalinresponsetowhatisgoingoninourenvironments(Hal\u00e1sz,1993;\nSteriade & Amzica, 1998).\nFigure 4.10 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.\nStage 3 and stage 4 of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because these stages\nare characterized by low frequency (up to 4 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.11). During this\ntime, an individual\u2019s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically. It is much more difficult to awaken\nsomeonefromsleepduringstage3andstage4thanduringearlierstages.Interestingly,individualswho\nhaveincreasedlevelsofalphabrainwaveactivity(moreoftenassociatedwithwakefulnessandtransition\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness 123\ninto stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 and stage 4 often report that they do not feel refreshed upon waking,\nregardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar, & Lichstein, 2008).\nFigure 4.11 (a) Delta waves, which are low frequency and high amplitude, characterize (b) slow-wave stage 3 and\nstage 4 sleep.\nREM SLEEP\nAsmentionedearlier,REMsleepismarkedbyrapidmovementsoftheeyes.Thebrainwavesassociated\nwith this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in Figure\n4.12,andthisistheperiodofsleepinwhichdreamingoccurs.Itisalsoassociatedwithparalysisofmuscle\nsystemsinthebodywiththeexceptionofthosethatmakecirculationandrespirationpossible.Therefore,\nno movement of voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often\nreferredtoasparadoxicalsleepbecauseofthiscombinationofhighbrainactivityandlackofmuscletone.\nLike NREM sleep, REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais,\n&Born,2001),althoughthereisdisagreementwithinthescientificcommunityabouthowimportantboth\nNREM and REM sleep are for normal learning and memory (Siegel, 2001).\nFigure 4.12 (a) A period of rapid eye movement is marked by the short red line segment.

In fact,\nsomehavesuggestedthatREMdeprivationcanactuallybebeneficialinsomecircumstances.Forinstance,\nREM sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to improve symptoms of people suffering from major\ndepression, and many effective antidepressant medications suppress REM sleep (Riemann, Berger, &\nVolderholzer, 2001; Vogel, 1975).\nIt should be pointed out that some reviews of the literature challenge this finding, suggesting that sleep\ndeprivationthatisnotlimitedtoREMsleepisjustaseffectiveormoreeffectiveatalleviatingdepressive\nsymptomsamongsomepatientssufferingfromdepression.Ineithercase,whysleepdeprivationimproves\nthe mood of some patients is not entirely understood (Giedke & Schw\u00e4rzler, 2002).

Freud made\ndistinctionsbetweenthemanifestcontentandthelatentcontentofdreams.Manifestcontentistheactual\ncontent, or storyline, of a dream. Latent content, on the other hand, refers to the hidden meaning of a\ndream.Forinstance,ifawomandreamsaboutbeingchasedbyasnake,Freudmighthavearguedthatthis\nrepresents the woman\u2019s fear of sexual intimacy, with the snake serving as a symbol of a man\u2019s penis.\nFreudwasnottheonlytheoristtofocusonthecontentofdreams.The20thcenturySwisspsychiatristCarl\nJungbelievedthatdreamsallowedustotapintothecollectiveunconscious. Thecollectiveunconscious,\nas described by Jung, is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone.\nAccording to Jung, certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are\nsimilar for all people regardless of culture or location.\nThesleepanddreamingresearcherRosalindCartwright,however,believesthatdreamssimplyreflectlife\neventsthatareimportanttothedreamer.UnlikeFreudandJung,Cartwright\u2019sideasaboutdreaminghave\nfound empirical support. For example, she and her colleagues published a study in which women going\nthrough divorce were asked several times over a five month period to report the degree to which their\nformer spouses were on their minds. These same women were awakened during REM sleep in order to\nprovideadetailedaccountoftheirdreamcontent.Therewasasignificantpositivecorrelationbetweenthe\ndegreetowhichwomenthoughtabouttheirformerspousesduringwakinghoursandthenumberoftimes\ntheir former spouses appeared as characters in their dreams (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, & Friedman,\n2006).

For example,\nHobson (2009) suggests that dreaming may represent a state of protoconsciousness. In other words,\ndreaming involves constructing a virtual reality in our heads that we might use to help us during\nwakefulness. Among a variety of neurobiological evidence, John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams\nas an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general. Lucid dreams are dreams in which certain\naspectsofwakefulnessaremaintainedduringadreamstate.Inaluciddream,apersonbecomesawareof\nthe fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control the dream\u2019s content (LaBerge, 1990).\n4.4 Sleep Problems and Disorders\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the symptoms and treatments of insomnia\n\u2022 Recognize the symptoms of several parasomnias\n\u2022 Describe the symptoms and treatments for sleep apnea\n\u2022 Recognize risk factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and steps to\nprevent it\n\u2022 Describe the symptoms and treatments for narcolepsy\nMany people experience disturbances in their sleep at some point in their lives.

In addition, these individuals may wake up several times during the night only to find that\nthey have difficulty getting back to sleep. As mentioned earlier, one of the criteria for insomnia involves\nexperiencing these symptoms for at least three nights a week for at least one month\u2019s time (Roth, 2007).\nIt is not uncommon for people suffering from insomnia to experience increased levels of anxiety about\ntheir inability to fall asleep. This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle because increased anxiety leads to\nincreased arousal, and higher levels of arousal make the prospect of falling asleep even more unlikely.\nChronic insomnia is almost always associated with feeling overtired and may be associated with\nsymptoms of depression.\nThere may be many factors that contribute to insomnia, including age, drug use, exercise, mental status,\nandbedtimeroutines.Notsurprisingly,insomniatreatmentmaytakeoneofseveraldifferentapproaches.\nPeople who suffer from insomnia might limit their use of stimulant drugs (such as caffeine) or increase\ntheir amount of physical exercise during the day. Some people might turn to over-the-counter (OTC) or\nprescribed sleep medications to help them sleep, but this should be done sparingly because many sleep\nmedications result in dependence and alter the nature of the sleep cycle, and they can increase insomnia\novertime.Thosewhocontinuetohaveinsomnia,particularlyifitaffectstheirqualityoflife,shouldseek\nprofessional treatment.\nSome forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help sufferers of insomnia.\nCognitive-behavioraltherapyisatypeofpsychotherapythatfocusesoncognitiveprocessesandproblem\nbehaviors. The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes\nin problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia (e.g., spending more waking time in bed).\nCognitive-behavioral therapy has been demonstrated to be quite effective in treating insomnia (Savard,\nSimard, Ivers, & Morin, 2005; Williams, Roth, Vatthauer, & McCrae, 2013).\nPARASOMNIAS\nA parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted, disruptive motor activity and/\nor experiences during sleep play a role. Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep.\nSleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors are all examples of parasomnias (Mahowald &\nSchenck, 2000).\nSleepwalking\nIn sleepwalking, or somnambulism, the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from\nwanderingabouttodrivinganautomobile.Duringperiodsofsleepwalking,sleepersoftenhavetheireyes\nopen,buttheyarenotresponsivetoattemptstocommunicatewiththem.Sleepwalkingmostoftenoccurs\nduring slow-wave sleep, but it can occur at any time during a sleep period in some affected individuals\n(Mahowald & Schenck, 2000).\nHistorically, somnambulism has been treated with a variety of pharmacotherapies ranging from\nbenzodiazepines to antidepressants. However, the success rate of such treatments is questionable.\nGuilleminault et al. (2005) found that sleepwalking was not alleviated with the use of benzodiazepines.\nHowever, all of their somnambulistic patients who also suffered from sleep-related breathing problems\nshowed a marked decrease in sleepwalking when their breathing problems were effectively treated.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness 127\nDIG DEEPER\nA Sleepwalking Defense?\nOnJanuary16,1997,ScottFalatersatdowntodinnerwithhiswifeandchildrenandtoldthemaboutdifficulties\nhewasexperiencingonaprojectatwork.Afterdinner,hepreparedsomematerialstouseinleadingachurch\nyouth group the following morning, and then he attempted repair the family\u2019s swimming pool pump before\nretiring to bed.

These behaviors vary widely, but they can include kicking,\npunching, scratching, yelling, and behaving like an animal that has been frightened or attacked. People\nwho suffer from this disorder can injure themselves or their sleeping partners when engaging in these\nbehaviors. Furthermore, these types of behaviors ultimately disrupt sleep, although affected individuals\nhave no memories that these behaviors have occurred (Arnulf, 2012).\nThis disorder is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. In\nfact, this relationship is so robust that some view the presence of RBD as a potential aid in the diagnosis\nand treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Ferini-Strambi, 2011). Clonazepam, an anti-\nanxiety medication with sedative properties, is most often used to treat RBD.

Because GABA has a\nquieting effect on the brain, GABA agonists also have a quieting effect; these types of drugs are often\nprescribed to treat both anxiety and insomnia.\nFigure 4.17 The GABA-gated chloride (Cl-) channel is embedded in the cell membrane of certain neurons. The\nchannel has multiple receptor sites where alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines bind to exert their effects. The\nbinding of these molecules opens the chloride channel, allowing negatively-charged chloride ions (Cl-) into the\nneuron's cell body. Changing its charge in a negative direction pushes the neuronawayfrom firing; thus, activating a\nGABA neuron has a quieting effect on the brain.\nAcutealcoholadministrationresultsinavarietyofchangestoconsciousness.Atratherlowdoses,alcohol\nuseisassociatedwithfeelingsofeuphoria.Asthedoseincreases,peoplereportfeelingsedated.Generally,\nalcohol is associated with decreases in reaction time and visual acuity, lowered levels of alertness, and\nreductioninbehavioralcontrol.Withexcessivealcoholuse,apersonmightexperienceacompletelossof\nconsciousnessand/ordifficultyrememberingeventsthatoccurredduringaperiodofintoxication(McKim\n& Hancock, 2013). In addition, if a pregnant woman consumes alcohol, her infant may be born with a\ncluster of birth defects and symptoms collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or fetal\nalcohol syndrome (FAS).\nWith repeated use of many central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, a person becomes\nphysically dependent upon the substance and will exhibit signs of both tolerance and withdrawal.\nPsychologicaldependenceonthesedrugsisalsopossible.Therefore,theabusepotentialofcentralnervous\nsystem depressants is relatively high.\nDrugwithdrawalisusuallyanaversiveexperience,anditcanbealife-threateningprocessinindividuals\nwho have a long history of very high doses of alcohol and/or barbiturates.

Many of these drugs act as\nagonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Dopamine activity is often associated with reward\nandcraving;therefore,drugsthataffectdopamineneurotransmissionoftenhaveabuseliability.Drugsin\nthis category include cocaine, amphetamines (including methamphetamine), cathinones (i.e., bath salts),\nMDMA (ecstasy), nicotine, and caffeine.\nCocaine can be taken in multiple ways.

Methamphetamine\nis a type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available (e.g., medications\ncontaining pseudoephedrine, a compound found in many over-the-counter cold and flu remedies).\nDespite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult,\nmethamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option (Shukla,\nCrump, & Chrisco, 2012).\nThe cocaine, amphetamine, cathinones, and MDMA users seek a euphoric high, feelings of intense\nelation and pleasure, especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking.\nRepeateduseofthesestimulantscanhavesignificantadverseconsequences.Userscanexperiencephysical\nsymptoms that include nausea, elevated blood pressure, and increased heart rate. In addition, these\ndrugs can cause feelings of anxiety, hallucinations, and paranoia (Fiorentini et al., 2011). Normal brain\nfunctioning is altered after repeated use of these drugs. For example, repeated use can lead to overall\ndepletion among the monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin).

Humans have an endogenous opioid\nneurotransmitter system\u2014the body makes small quantities of opioid compounds that bind to opioid\nreceptors reducing pain and producing euphoria. Thus, opioid drugs, which mimic this endogenous\npainkilling mechanism, have an extremely high potential for abuse. Natural opioids, called opiates, are\nderivatives of opium, which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant.

This final section will consider hypnotic and meditative\nstates as additional examples of altered states of consciousness experienced by some individuals.\nHYPNOSIS\nHypnosis is a state of extreme self-focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external\nstimuli.Inthetherapeuticsetting,aclinicianmayuserelaxationandsuggestioninanattempttoalterthe\nthoughtsandperceptionsofapatient.Hypnosishasalsobeenusedtodrawoutinformationbelievedtobe\nburieddeeplyinsomeone\u2019smemory.Forindividualswhoareespeciallyopentothepowerofsuggestion,\nhypnosis can prove to be a very effective technique, and brain imaging studies have demonstrated\nthat hypnotic states are associated with global changes in brain functioning (Del Casale et al., 2012;\nGuldenmund, Vanhaudenhuyse, Boly, Laureys, & Soddu, 2012).\nHistorically, hypnosis has been viewed with some suspicion because of its portrayal in popular media\nand entertainment (Figure 4.23). Therefore, it is important to make a distinction between hypnosis as\nanempiricallybasedtherapeuticapproachversusasaformofentertainment.Contrarytopopularbelief,\nindividuals undergoing hypnosis usually have clear memories of the hypnotic experience and are in\ncontrol of their own behaviors. While hypnosis may be useful in enhancing memory or a skill, such\nenhancements are very modest in nature (Raz, 2011).\nFigure 4.23 Popular portrayals of hypnosis have led to some widely-held misconceptions.\nHowexactlydoesahypnotistbringaparticipanttoastateofhypnosis?Whiletherearevariations,there\nare four parts that appear consistent in bringing people into the state of suggestibility associated with\nhypnosis (National Research Council, 1994). These components include:\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness 139\n\u2022 The participant is guided to focus on one thing, such as the hypnotist\u2019s words or a ticking watch.\n\u2022 The participant is made comfortable and is directed to be relaxed and sleepy.\n\u2022 The participant is told to be open to the process of hypnosis, trust the hypnotist and let go.\n\u2022 The participant is encouraged to use his or her imagination.\nThese steps are conducive to being open to the heightened suggestibility of hypnosis.\nPeople vary in terms of their ability to be hypnotized, but a review of available research suggests that\nmost people are at least moderately hypnotizable (Kihlstrom, 2013). Hypnosis in conjunction with other\ntechniques is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes and has shown to be at least somewhat effective\nforpainmanagement,treatmentofdepression andanxiety,smokingcessation, andweightloss(Alladin,\n2012; Elkins, Johnson, & Fisher, 2012; Golden, 2012; Montgomery, Schnur, & Kravits, 2012).\nSomescientistsareworkingtodeterminewhetherthepowerofsuggestioncanaffectcognitiveprocesses\nsuch as learning, with a view to using hypnosis in educational settings (Wark, 2011). Furthermore, there\nis some evidence that hypnosis can alter processes that were once thought to be automatic and outside\nthe purview of voluntary control, such as reading (Lifshitz, Aubert Bonn, Fischer, Kashem, & Raz, 2013;\nRaz, Shapiro, Fan, & Posner, 2002). However, it should be noted that others have suggested that the\nautomaticity of these processes remains intact (Augustinova & Ferrand, 2012).\nHow does hypnosis work? Two theories attempt to answer this question: One theory views hypnosis as\ndissociationandtheothertheoryviewsitastheperformanceofasocialrole.Accordingtothedissociation\nview,hypnosisiseffectivelyadissociatedstateofconsciousness,muchlikeourearlierexamplewhereyou\nmay drive to work, but you are only minimally aware of the process of driving because your attention\nis focused elsewhere. This theory is supported by Ernest Hilgard\u2019s research into hypnosis and pain. In\nHilgard\u2019s experiments, he induced participants into a state of hypnosis, and placed their arms into ice\nwater.Participantsweretoldtheywouldnotfeelpain,buttheycouldpressabuttoniftheydid;whilethey\nreported not feeling pain, they did, in fact, press the button, suggesting a dissociation of consciousness\nwhile in the hypnotic state (Hilgard & Hilgard, 1994).\nTaking a different approach to explain hypnosis, the social-cognitive theory of hypnosis sees people\nin hypnotic states as performing the social role of a hypnotized person. As you will learn when you\nstudy social roles, people\u2019s behavior can be shaped by their expectations of how they should act in\na given situation. Some view a hypnotized person\u2019s behavior not as an altered or dissociated state of\nconsciousness, but as their fulfillment of the social expectations for that role.\nMEDITATION\nMeditation is the act of focusing on a single target (such as the breath or a repeated sound) to increase\nawarenessofthemoment.Whilehypnosisisgenerallyachievedthroughtheinteractionofatherapistand\nthe person being treated, an individual can perform meditation alone. Often, however, people wishing\ntolearntomeditatereceivesometrainingintechniquestoachieveameditativestate.Ameditativestate,\nas shown by EEG recordings of newly-practicing meditators, is not an altered state of consciousness per\nse; however, patterns of brain waves exhibited by expert meditators may represent a unique state of\nconsciousness (Fell, Axmacher, & Haupt, 2010).\nAlthoughthereareanumberofdifferenttechniquesinuse,thecentralfeatureofallmeditationisclearing\nthe mind in order to achieve a state of relaxed awareness and focus (Chen et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2012).\nMindfulness meditation has recently become popular. In the variation of meditation, the meditator\u2019s\nattention is focused on some internal process or an external object (Zeidan, Grant, Brown, McHaffie, &\nCoghill, 2012).\nMeditative techniques have their roots in religious practices (Figure 4.24), but their use has grown in\npopularity among practitioners of alternative medicine. Research indicates that meditation may help\nreduce blood pressure, and the American Heart Association suggests that meditation might be used in 140 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness\nconjunction with more traditional treatments as a way to manage hypertension, although there is not\nsufficient data for a recommendation to be made (Brook et al., 2013). Like hypnosis, meditation also\nshowspromiseinstressmanagement,sleepquality(Caldwell,Harrison,Adams,Quin,&Greeson,2010),\ntreatment of mood and anxiety disorders (Chen et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2010; V\u00f8llestad, Nielsen, &\nNielsen, 2012), and pain management (Reiner, Tibi, & Lipsitz, 2013).\nFigure 4.24 (a) This is a statue of a meditating Buddha, representing one of the many religious traditions of which\nmeditation plays a part.

Important factors\nin these changes are the biological rhythms, and, more specifically, the circadian rhythms generated\nby the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Typically, our biological clocks are aligned with our external\nenvironment, and light tends to be an important cue in setting this clock.

If people go extended periods of time without sleep, they will\naccrue a sleep debt and potentially experience a number of adverse psychological and physiological\nconsequences. 144 Chapter 4 | States of Consciousness\n4.2Sleep and Why We Sleep\nWedevoteaverylargeportionoftimetosleep,andourbrainshavecomplexsystemsthatcontrolvarious\naspects of sleep. Several hormones important for physical growth and maturation are secreted during\nsleep.Whilethereasonwesleepremainssomething ofamystery,thereissomeevidencetosuggestthat\nsleep is very important to learning and memory.\n4.3Stages of Sleep\nThe different stages of sleep are characterized by the patterns of brain waves associated with each stage.\nAs a person transitions from being awake to falling asleep, alpha waves are replaced by theta waves.\nSleep spindles and K-complexes emerge in stage 2 sleep. Stage 3 and stage 4 are described as slow-wave\nsleep that is marked by a predominance of delta waves. REM sleep involves rapid movements of the\neyes,paralysisofvoluntarymuscles,anddreaming.BothNREMandREMsleepappeartoplayimportant\nroles in learning and memory. Dreams may represent life events that are important to the dreamer.\nAlternatively,dreamingmayrepresentastateofprotoconsciousness,oravirtualreality,inthemindthat\nhelps a person during consciousness.\n4.4Sleep Problems and Disorders\nMany individuals suffer from some type of sleep disorder or disturbance at some point in their lives.\nInsomnia is a common experience in which people have difficulty falling or staying asleep. Parasomnias\ninvolve unwanted motor behavior or experiences throughout the sleep cycle and include RBD,\nsleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors. Sleep apnea occurs when individuals stop\nbreathingduringtheirsleep,andinthecaseofsuddeninfantdeathsyndrome,infantswillstopbreathing\nduring sleep and die. Narcolepsy involves an irresistible urge to fall asleep during waking hours and is\noften associated with cataplexy and hallucination.\n4.5Substance Use and Abuse\nSubstance use disorder is defined in DSM-5 as a compulsive pattern of drug use despite negative\nconsequences.Bothphysicalandpsychologicaldependenceareimportantpartsofthisdisorder.Alcohol,\nbarbiturates, and benzodiazepines are central nervous system depressants that affect GABA\nneurotransmission. Cocaine, amphetamine, cathinones, and MDMA are all central nervous stimulants\nthatagonizedopamineneurotransmission,whilenicotineandcaffeineaffectacetylcholineandadenosine,\nrespectively. Opiate drugs serve as powerful analgesics through their effects on the endogenous opioid\nneurotransmittersystem,andhallucinogenicdrugscausepronouncedchangesinsensoryandperceptual\nexperiences.

We use this\ninformationtosuccessfullynavigateandinteractwithourenvironmentsothatwecanfindnourishment,\nseek shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations.\nThis chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the\nnervous system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the\ndistinctionbetweensensationandperception.Thenweconsiderthephysicalpropertiesoflightandsound\nstimuli, along with an overview of the basic structure and function of the major sensory systems. The\nchapter will close with a discussion of a historically important theory of perception called Gestalt. 150 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\n5.1 Sensation versus Perception\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Distinguish between sensation and perception\n\u2022 Describe the concepts of absolute threshold and difference threshold\n\u2022 Discuss the roles attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation play in perception\nSENSATION\nWhatdoesitmeantosensesomething?Sensoryreceptorsarespecializedneuronsthatrespondtospecific\ntypesofstimuli.Whensensoryinformationisdetectedbyasensoryreceptor,sensationhasoccurred.For\nexample, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These\ncells relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to\nthecentralnervoussystem.Theconversionfromsensorystimulusenergytoactionpotentialisknownas\ntransduction.\nYou have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition),\nsmell (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five\nsenses is oversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the\nvestibularsense),bodypositionandmovement(proprioceptionandkinesthesia),pain(nociception),and\ntemperature (thermoception).\nThesensitivityofagivensensorysystemtotherelevantstimulicanbeexpressedasanabsolutethreshold.\nAbsolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the\nstimulustobedetected50%ofthetime.Anotherwaytothinkaboutthisisbyaskinghowdimcanalight\nbeorhowsoftcanasoundbeandstillbedetectedhalfofthetime.Thesensitivityofoursensoryreceptors\ncan be quite amazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the\nbackoftheeyecandetectacandleflame30milesaway(Okawa&Sampath,2007).Underquietconditions,\nthehaircells(thereceptorcellsoftheinnerear)candetectthetickofaclock20feetaway(Galanter,1962).\nIt is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious\nawareness\u2014these are called subliminal messages. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it\nis strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute\nthreshold. A message below that threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not\nconsciously aware of it. Over the years there has been a great deal of speculation about the use of\nsubliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and self-help audio programs. Research evidence shows\nthat in laboratory settings, people can process and respond to information outside of awareness. But\nthis does not mean that we obey these messages like zombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect\non behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc, 1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel,\nSarrazin, Legrain, & Gobanc\u00e9, 2009; Loersch, Durso, & Petty, 2013).\nAbsolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are\noptimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required\nto detect a difference between them. This is known as the just noticeable difference (jnd) or difference\nthreshold. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus\nintensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were\nto receive a text message on her cell phone which caused her screen to light up, chances are that many\npeople would notice the change in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in\na brightly lit arena during a basketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness\ndoesnotchange,butitsabilitytobedetectedasachangeinilluminationvariesdramaticallybetweenthe\ntwocontexts.ErnstWeberproposedthistheoryofchangeindifferencethresholdinthe1830s,andithas\nbecomeknownasWeber\u2019slaw:Thedifferencethresholdisaconstantfractionoftheoriginalstimulus,as\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception 151\nthe example illustrates.\nPERCEPTION\nWhile our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately\nhow we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the\nwaysensoryinformationisorganized,interpreted,andconsciouslyexperienced.Perceptioninvolvesboth\nbottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built\nfrom sensory input. On the other hand, how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available\nknowledge, our experiences, and our thoughts. This is calledtop-down processing.\nOne way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is\npsychological.Forexample,uponwalkingintoakitchenandsmellingthescentofbakingcinnamonrolls,\nthesensationisthescentreceptorsdetectingtheodorofcinnamon,buttheperceptionmaybe\u201cMmm,this\nsmells like the bread Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays.\u201d\nAlthoughourperceptionsarebuiltfromsensations,notallsensationsresultinperception.Infact,weoften\ndon\u2019t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known as\nsensoryadaptation.Imagineenteringaclassroomwithanoldanalogclock.Uponfirstenteringtheroom,\nyou can hear the ticking of the clock; as you begin to engage in conversation with classmates or listen\nto your professor greet the class, you are no longer aware of the ticking. The clock is still ticking, and\nthat information is still affecting sensory receptors of the auditory system. The fact that you no longer\nperceive the sound demonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation\nand perception are different.\nThere is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role\nindeterminingwhatissensedversuswhatisperceived.Imagineyouareatapartyfullofmusic,chatter,\nand laughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the\nbackground noise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would\nprobably be unable to answer that question.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee for yourself how inattentional blindness works by checking out thisselective\nattention test (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/blindness)from Simons and Chabris\n(1999).\nOneofthemostinterestingdemonstrationsofhowimportantattentionisindeterminingourperceptionof\ntheenvironmentoccurredinafamousstudyconductedbyDanielSimonsandChristopherChabris(1999).\nIn this study, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs.\nParticipantswereaskedtocountthenumberoftimestheteaminwhitepassedtheball.Duringthevideo,\na person dressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams.

They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects,\ndisregardingtheothercolor.Whenaredcrosspassedacrossthescreen,aboutonethirdofsubjectsdidnot 152 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nnotice it (Figure 5.2) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).\nFigure 5.2 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen because\ntheir attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nMotivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and,\nwhile taking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then\nyouhaveexperiencedhowmotivationtodetectameaningfulstimuluscanshiftourabilitytodiscriminate\nbetween a true sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is\nembedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a\nmother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is\nasleep.Signaldetectiontheoryhaspracticalapplications,suchasincreasingairtrafficcontrolleraccuracy.\nControllers need to be able to detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen\nand follow those planes as they move through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who\ndeveloped signal detection theory was focused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to\nplane blips (Swets, 1964).\nOurperceptionscanalsobeaffectedbyourbeliefs,values,prejudices,expectations,andlifeexperiences.\nAs you will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision\nduringcriticalperiodsofdevelopmenthavetroubleperceivingdepth(Fawcett,Wang,&Birch,2005).The\nshared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception.\nForexample,MarshallSegall,DonaldCampbell,andMelvilleHerskovits(1963)publishedtheresultsofa\nmultinationalstudyinwhichtheydemonstratedthatindividualsfromWesternculturesweremoreprone\ntoexperiencecertaintypesofvisualillusionsthanindividualsfromnon-Westerncultures,andviceversa.\nOne such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion (Figure\n5.3): The lines appear to be different lengths, but they are actually the same length.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception 153\nFigure 5.3 In the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows at\nthe ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) When\napplied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines are the\nsame length.\nThese perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features\nexperienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for\nexample, have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall\u2019s study called a\ncarpentered world (Segall et al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an\nuncarpenteredview,suchastheZuluofSouthAfrica,whosevillagesaremadeupofroundhutsarranged\nin circles, are less susceptible to this illusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected\nby cultural factors. Indeed, research has demonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its\npleasantnessanditsintensity,variescross-culturally(Ayabe-Kanamura,Saito,Distel,Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez,&\nHudson, 1998).\nChildrendescribedasthrillseekersaremorelikelytoshowtastepreferencesforintensesourflavors(Liem,\nWesterbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might\naffectperception.Furthermore,individualswhoholdpositiveattitudestowardreduced-fatfoodsaremore\nlikely to rate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes\nabout these products (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994).\n5.2 Waves and Wavelengths\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe important physical features of wave forms\n\u2022 Show how physical properties of light waves are associated with perceptual experience\n\u2022 Show how physical properties of sound waves are associated with perceptual experience\nVisualandauditorystimulibothoccurintheformofwaves.Althoughthetwostimuliareverydifferentin\ntermsofcomposition,waveformssharesimilarcharacteristicsthatareespeciallyimportanttoourvisual\nand auditory perceptions.

The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound\u2019s\npitch. High-frequency sound waves are perceived as high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency sound\nwaves are perceived as low-pitched sounds. The audible range of sound frequencies is between 20 and\n20000 Hz, with greatest sensitivity to those frequencies that fall in the middle of this range.\nAs was the case with the visible spectrum, other species show differences in their audible ranges. For\ninstance, chickens have a very limited audible range, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mice have an audible range\nfrom1000to91000Hz,andthebelugawhale\u2019saudiblerangeisfrom1000to123000Hz.Ourpetdogsand\ncats have audible ranges of about 70\u201345000 Hz and 45\u201364000 Hz, respectively (Strain, 2003).\nThe loudness of a given sound is closely associated with the amplitude of the sound wave. Higher\namplitudes are associated with louder sounds. Loudness is measured in terms of decibels (dB), a\nlogarithmic unit of sound intensity. A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB; a rock concert\nmightcheckinat120dB(Figure 5.8).Awhisper5feetawayorrustlingleavesareatthelowendofour\nhearing range; sounds like a window air conditioner, a normal conversation, and even heavy traffic or\na vacuum cleaner are within a tolerable range. However, there is the potential for hearing damage from 156 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nabout 80 dB to 130 dB: These are sounds of a food processor, power lawnmower, heavy truck (25 feet\naway),subwaytrain(20feetaway),liverockmusic,andajackhammer.Thethresholdforpainisabout130\ndB, a jet plane taking off or a revolver firing at close range (Dunkle, 1982).\nFigure 5.8 This figure illustrates the loudness of common sounds.

The pupil\u2019s\nsize is controlled by muscles that are connected to theiris, which is the colored portion of the eye. 158 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nFigure 5.10 The anatomy of the eye is illustrated in this diagram.\nAfter passing through the pupil, light crosses the lens, a curved, transparent structure that serves to\nprovide additional focus.

Rods are colored green and cones are blue.\nWe have all experienced the different sensitivities of rods and cones when making the transition from\na brightly lit environment to a dimly lit environment. Imagine going to see a blockbuster movie on a\nclear summer day. As you walk from the brightly lit lobby into the dark theater, you notice that you\nimmediately have difficulty seeing much of anything. After a few minutes, you begin to adjust to the\ndarkness and can see the interior of the theater. In the bright environment, your vision was dominated\nprimarily by cone activity. As you move to the dark environment, rod activity dominates, but there is a\ndelayintransitioningbetweenthephases.Ifyourrodsdonottransformlightintonerveimpulsesaseasily\nand efficiently as they should, you will have difficulty seeing in dim light, a condition known as night\nblindness.\nRods and cones are connected (via several interneurons) to retinal ganglion cells. Axons from the retinal\nganglioncellsconvergeandexitthroughthebackoftheeyetoformtheopticnerve.Theopticnervecarries\nvisual information from the retina to the brain. There is a point in the visual field called the blind spot:\nEvenwhenlightfromasmallobjectisfocusedontheblindspot,wedonotseeit.Wearenotconsciously\naware of our blind spots for two reasons: First, each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field;\ntherefore,theblindspotsdonotoverlap.Second,ourvisualsystemfillsintheblindspotsothatalthough\nwe cannot respond to visual information that occurs in that portion of the visual field, we are also not\naware that information is missing.\nThe optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm.

Visual information might be processed in parallel pathways which can\ngenerally be described as the \u201cwhat pathway\u201d and the \u201cwhere/how\u201d pathway. The \u201cwhat pathway\u201d\nis involved in object recognition and identification, while the \u201cwhere/how pathway\u201d is involved with\nlocation in space and how one might interact with a particular visual stimulus (Milner & Goodale, 2008;\nUngerleider&Haxby,1994).Forexample,whenyouseeaballrollingdownthestreet,the\u201cwhatpathway\u201d\nidentifies what the object is, and the \u201cwhere/how pathway\u201d identifies its location or movement in space.\nCOLOR AND DEPTH PERCEPTION\nWe do not see the world in black and white; neither do we see it as two-dimensional (2-D) or flat (just\nheightandwidth,nodepth).Let\u2019slookathowcolorvisionworksandhowweperceivethreedimensions\n(height, width, and depth).\nColor Vision\nNormal-sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision. Each of these\nconetypesismaximallysensitivetoaslightlydifferentwavelengthoflight.Accordingtothetrichromatic\ntheory of color vision, shown in Figure 5.13, all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining\nred, green, and blue. The three types of cones are each receptive to one of the colors.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception 161\nFigure 5.13 This figure illustrates the different sensitivities for the three cone types found in a normal-sighted\nindividual.

The basic idea is that some cells of the visual system are excited\nby one of the opponent colors and inhibited by the other. So, a cell that was excited by wavelengths\nassociated with green would be inhibited by wavelengths associated with red, and vice versa. One of\nthe implications of opponent processing is that we do not experience greenish-reds or yellowish-blues\nas colors. Another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages.

But once the signal moves past the retina on its way to\nthe brain, the cells respond in a way consistent with opponent-process theory (Land, 1959; Kaiser, 1997).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/colorvision)to see the first part of\na documentary explaining color vision in more detail.\nDepth Perception\nOur ability to perceive spatial relationships in three-dimensional (3-D) space is known as depth\nperception.

The outer ear includes the pinna, which is the visible\npart of the ear that protrudes from our heads, the auditory canal, and the tympanic membrane, or\neardrum.

As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along\nthe auditory nerve to the brain. Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial\ngeniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain\nfor processing. Like the visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory\nrecognitionandlocalizationisprocessedinparallelstreams(Rauschecker&Tian,2000;Renieretal.,2009).\nPITCH PERCEPTION\nDifferentfrequenciesofsoundwavesareassociatedwithdifferencesinourperceptionofthepitchofthose\nsounds. Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched. How\ndoes the auditory system differentiate among various pitches?\nSeveral theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception. We\u2019ll discuss two of them here:\ntemporaltheoryandplacetheory.Thetemporaltheoryofpitchperceptionassertsthatfrequencyiscoded\nbytheactivitylevelofasensoryneuron.Thiswouldmeanthatagivenhaircellwouldfireactionpotentials\nrelated to the frequency of the sound wave.

More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to\nhigh frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. Therefore, hair\ncellsthatareinthebaseportionwouldbelabeledashigh-pitchreceptors,whilethoseinthetipofbasilar\nmembrane would be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001).\nInreality,boththeoriesexplaindifferentaspectsofpitchperception.Atfrequenciesuptoabout4000Hz,\nitisclearthatboththerateofactionpotentialsandplacecontributetoourperceptionofpitch.However,\nmuch higher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001).\nSOUND LOCALIZATION\nTheabilitytolocatesoundinourenvironmentsisanimportantpartofhearing.Localizingsoundcouldbe\nconsideredsimilartothewaythatweperceivedepthinourvisualfields.Likethemonocularandbinocular\ncues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both monaural (one-eared) and\nbinaural(two-eared) cues to localize sound.\nEachpinnainteractswithincomingsoundwavesdifferently,dependingonthesound\u2019ssourcerelativeto\nourbodies.Thisinteractionprovidesamonauralcuethatishelpfulinlocatingsoundsthatoccuraboveor\nbelowandinfrontorbehindus.Thesoundwavesreceivedbyyourtwoearsfromsoundsthatcomefrom\ndirectly above, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential\n(Grothe, Pecka, & McAlpine, 2010).\nBinaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis\nbyrelyingondifferencesinpatternsofvibrationoftheeardrumbetweenourtwoears.Ifasoundcomes\nfromanoff-centerlocation,itcreatestwotypesofbinauralcues:interauralleveldifferencesandinteraural\ntimingdifferences.Interauralleveldifferencereferstothefactthatasoundcomingfromtherightsideof\nyour body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound\nwave as it passes through your head. Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the\ntime at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear (Figure 5.17). Certain brain areas monitor these\ndifferences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010). 166 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nFigure 5.17 Localizing sound involves the use of both monaural and binaural cues.

From the olfactory bulb,\ninformation is sent to regions of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex, which is located\nvery near the gustatory cortex (Lodovichi & Belluscio, 2012; Spors et al., 2013).\nFigure 5.20 Olfactory receptors are the hair-like parts that extend from the olfactory bulb into the mucous membrane\nof the nasal cavity.\nThereistremendousvariationinthesensitivityoftheolfactorysystemsofdifferentspecies.Weoftenthink\nofdogsashavingfarsuperiorolfactorysystemsthanourown,andindeed,dogscandosomeremarkable\nthingswiththeirnoses.Thereissomeevidencetosuggestthatdogscan\u201csmell\u201ddangerousdropsinblood\nglucose levels as well as cancerous tumors (Wells, 2010).

Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive\nstatus of a potential mate. So, for example, when a female rat is ready to mate, she secretes pheromonal\nsignals that draw attention from nearby male rats. Pheromonal activation is actually an important\ncomponentinelicitingsexualbehaviorinthemalerat(Furlow,1996,2012;Purvis&Haynes,1972;Sachs,\n1997). There has also been a good deal of research (and controversy) about pheromones in humans\n(Comfort, 1971; Russell, 1976; Wolfgang-Kimball, 1992; Weller, 1998).\nTOUCH, THERMOCEPTION, AND NOCICEPTION\nA number of receptors are distributed throughout the skin to respond to various touch-related stimuli\n(Figure 5.21). These receptors include Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel\u2019s disks, and\nRuffini corpuscles. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations, and\nPaciniancorpusclesdetecttransientpressureandhigherfrequencyvibrations.Merkel\u2019sdisksrespondto\nlight pressure, whileRuffini corpusclesdetect stretch (Abraira & Ginty, 2013). 170 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nFigure 5.21 There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin, each attuned to specific touch-related\nstimuli.\nIn addition to the receptors located in the skin, there are also a number of free nerve endings that\nserve sensory functions. These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch-related\nstimuliandserveassensoryreceptorsforboththermoception(temperatureperception)andnociception\n(a signal indicating potential harm and maybe pain) (Garland, 2012; Petho & Reeh, 2012; Spray, 1986).\nSensoryinformationcollectedfromthereceptorsandfreenerveendingstravelsupthespinalcordandis\ntransmittedtoregionsofthemedulla,thalamus,andultimatelytosomatosensorycortex,whichislocated\nin the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe.\nPain Perception\nPainisanunpleasantexperiencethatinvolvesbothphysicalandpsychologicalcomponents.Feelingpain\nisquiteadaptivebecauseitmakesusawareofaninjury,anditmotivatesustoremoveourselvesfromthe\ncauseofthatinjury.Inaddition,painalsomakesuslesslikelytosufferadditionalinjurybecausewewill\nbe gentler with our injured body parts.\nGenerallyspeaking,paincanbeconsideredtobeneuropathicorinflammatoryinnature.Painthatsignals\nsometypeoftissuedamageisknownasinflammatorypain.Insomesituations,painresultsfromdamage\ntoneuronsofeithertheperipheralorcentralnervoussystem.Asaresult,painsignalsthataresenttothe\nbraingetexaggerated.Thistypeofpainisknownasneuropathicpain.Multipletreatmentoptionsforpain\nreliefrangefromrelaxationtherapytotheuseofanalgesicmedicationstodeepbrainstimulation.Themost\neffectivetreatmentoptionforagivenindividualwilldependonanumberofconsiderations,includingthe\nseverity and persistence of the pain and any medical/psychological conditions.\nSome individuals are born without the ability to feel pain.

Young children have serious mouth and tongue injuries because they have bitten\nthemselves repeatedly.

As Figure 5.22\nshows, the major sensory organs (utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals) of this system are\nlocatednexttothecochleaintheinnerear.Thevestibularorgansarefluid-filledandhavehaircells,similar\ntotheonesfoundintheauditorysystem,whichrespondtomovementoftheheadandgravitationalforces.\nWhenthesehaircellsarestimulated,theysendsignalstothebrainviathevestibularnerve.Althoughwe\nmaynotbeconsciouslyawareofourvestibularsystem\u2019ssensoryinformationundernormalcircumstances,\nits importance is apparent when we experience motion sickness and/or dizziness related to infections of\nthe inner ear (Khan & Chang, 2013).\nFigure 5.22 The major sensory organs of the vestibular system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear.\nThese include the utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals (posterior, superior, and horizontal).\nIn addition to maintaining balance, the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling\nmovement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body\nposition.Therefore,bothproprioception(perceptionofbodyposition)andkinesthesia(perceptionofthe\nbody\u2019s movement through space) interact with information provided by the vestibular system.\nThese sensory systems also gather information from receptors that respond to stretch and tension in\nmuscles, joints, skin, and tendons (Lackner & DiZio, 2005; Proske, 2006; Proske & Gandevia, 2012).\nProprioceptive and kinesthetic information travels to the brain via the spinal column. Several cortical\nregionsinadditiontothecerebellumreceiveinformationfromandsendinformationtothesensoryorgans\nof the proprioceptive and kinesthetic systems. 172 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\n5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the figure-ground relationship\n\u2022 Define Gestalt principles of grouping\n\u2022 Describe how perceptual set is influenced by an individual\u2019s characteristics and mental state\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Max Wertheimer published a paper demonstrating that individuals\nperceivedmotioninrapidlyflickeringstaticimages\u2014aninsightthatcametohimasheusedachild\u2019stoy\ntachistoscope. Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang K\u00f6hler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his\npartners,believedthatperceptioninvolvedmorethansimplycombiningsensorystimuli.Thisbeliefledto\nanewmovement withinthefieldofpsychology knownasGestaltpsychology.Theword gestaltliterally\nmeansformorpattern,butitsusereflectstheideathatthewholeisdifferentfromthesumofitsparts.In\notherwords,thebraincreatesaperceptionthatismorethansimplythesumofavailablesensoryinputs,\nanditdoessoinpredictableways.Gestaltpsychologiststranslatedthesepredictablewaysintoprinciples\nbywhichweorganizesensoryinformation.Asaresult,Gestaltpsychologyhasbeenextremelyinfluential\nin the area of sensation and perception (Rock & Palmer, 1990).\nOne Gestalt principle is the figure-ground relationship. According to this principle, we tend to segment\nour visual world into figure and ground. Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual\nfield,whilethegroundisthebackground.AsFigure 5.23shows,ourperceptioncanvarytremendously,\ndepending on what is perceived as figure and what is perceived as ground. Presumably, our ability to\ninterpret sensory information depends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any\nparticularcase,althoughthisassumption hasbeencalledintoquestion (Peterson &Gibson, 1994;Vecera\n& O\u2019Reilly, 1998).\nFigure 5.23 The concept of figure-ground relationship explains why this image can be perceived either as a vase or\nas a pair of faces.\nAnother Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity. This\nprinciple asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as Figure 5.24\nillustrates.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception 173\nFigure 5.24 The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b)\nthree columns on the right side.\nHowwereadsomethingprovidesanotherillustrationoftheproximityconcept.Forexample,wereadthis\nsentencelikethis,notlikethisorthat.Wegroupthelettersofagivenwordtogetherbecausethereareno\nspacesbetweentheletters,andweperceivewordsbecausetherearespacesbetweeneachword.Hereare\nsome more examples: Cany oum akes enseo ft hiss entence? What doth es e wor dsmea n?\nWe might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields. According to this\nprinciple, things that are alike tend to be grouped together (Figure 5.25). For example, when watching\na football game, we tend to group individuals based on the colors of their uniforms. When watching an\noffensive drive, we can get a sense of the two teams simply by grouping along this dimension.\nFigure 5.25 When looking at this array of dots, we likely perceive alternating rows of colors. We are grouping these\ndots according to the principle of similarity.\nTwo additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity (or good continuation) and closure. The law\nof continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than\njagged, broken lines (Figure 5.26). The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into\ncomplete objects rather than as a series of parts (Figure 5.27). 174 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nFigure 5.26 Good continuation would suggest that we are more likely to perceive this as two overlapping lines,\nrather than four lines meeting in the center.\nFigure 5.27 Closure suggests that we will perceive a complete circle and rectangle rather than a series of\nsegments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/gestalt)showing real world\nillustrations of Gestalt principles.\nAccording to Gestalt theorists, pattern perception, or our ability to discriminate among different figures\nand shapes, occurs by following the principles described above. You probably feel fairly certain that\nyour perception accurately matches the real world, but this is not always the case. Our perceptions are\nbasedonperceptualhypotheses:educatedguessesthatwemakewhileinterpretingsensoryinformation.\nThese hypotheses are informed by a number of factors, including our personalities, experiences, and\nexpectations. We use these hypotheses to generate our perceptual set. For instance, research has\ndemonstrated that those who are given verbal priming produce a biased interpretation of complex\nambiguous figures (Goolkasian & Woodbury, 2010).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception 175\nDIG DEEPER\nThe Depths of Perception: Bias, Prejudice, and Cultural Factors\nIn this chapter, you have learned that perception is a complex process. Built from sensations, but influenced\nby our own experiences, biases, prejudices, and cultures, perceptions can be very different from person\nto person. Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception. For instance,\nseveralstudieshavedemonstratedthatnon-Blackparticipantsidentifyweaponsfasterandaremorelikelyto\nidentifynon-weaponsasweaponswhentheimageoftheweaponispairedwiththeimageofaBlackperson\n(Payne,2001;Payne,Shimizu,&Jacoby,2005).Furthermore,Whiteindividuals\u2019decisionstoshootanarmed\ntargetinavideogameismademorequicklywhenthetargetisBlack(Correll,Park,Judd,&Wittenbrink,2002;\nCorrell,Urland,&Ito,2006).Thisresearchisimportant,consideringthenumberofveryhigh-profilecasesin\nthe last few decades in which young Blacks were killed by people who claimed to believe that the unarmed\nindividuals were armed and/or represented some threat to their personal safety. 176 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception\nKey Terms\nabsolute threshold minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be\ndetected 50% of the time\nafterimage continuation of a visual sensation after removal of the stimulus\namplitude height of a wave\nbasilar membrane thin strip of tissue within the cochlea that contains the hair cells which serve as the\nsensory receptors for the auditory system\nbinaural cue two-eared cue to localize sound\nbinocular cue cue that relies on the use of both eyes\nbinocular disparity slightly different view of the world that each eye receives\nblind spot point where we cannot respond to visual information in that portion of the visual field\nbottom-up processing system in which perceptions are built from sensory input\nclosure organizing our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts\ncochlea fluid-filled, snail-shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells of the auditory system\ncochlear implant electronic device that consists of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode\narray to directly stimulate the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain\nconductive hearing loss failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the ossicles\ncone specialized photoreceptor that works best in bright light conditions and detects color\ncongenital deafness deafness from birth\ncongenital insensitivity to pain (congenital analgesia) genetic disorder that results in the inability to\nexperience pain\ncornea transparent covering over the eye\ndeafness partial or complete inability to hear\ndecibel (dB) logarithmic unit of sound intensity\ndepth perception ability to perceive depth\nelectromagnetic spectrum all the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment\nfigure-ground relationship segmenting our visual world into figure and ground\nfovea small indentation in the retina that contains cones\nfrequency number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period\nGestalt psychology field of psychology based on the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its\nparts\ngood continuation (also, continuity) we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 5 | Sensation and Perception 177\nrather than jagged, broken lines\nhair cell auditory receptor cell of the inner ear\nhertz (Hz) cycles per second;

The eye\u2019s lens focuses this light so that the\nimage is focused on a region of the retina known as the fovea. The fovea contains cones that possess\nhigh levels of visual acuity and operate best in bright light conditions. Rods are located throughout the\nretinaandoperatebestunderdimlightconditions.Visualinformationleavestheeyeviatheopticnerve.\nInformation from each visual field is sent to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm.

Our ability to perceive pitch\nrelies on both the firing rate of the hair cells in the basilar membrane as well as their location within the\nmembrane. In terms of sound localization, both monaural and binaural cues are used to locate where\nsounds originate in our environment.\nIndividualscanbeborndeaf,ortheycandevelopdeafnessasaresultofage,geneticpredisposition,and/\nor environmental causes.

Although only minutes old, the hatchlings know exactly what to do. Their flippers are not\nvery efficient for moving across the hot sand, yet they continue onward, instinctively.

Despite these dangers, the hatchlings are driven to leave the safety of their nest and find the\nocean.\nNot fardown this same beach, Ben and his son, Julian,paddle out into the ocean on surfboards.

Infants suckle at their mother\u2019s breast. Dogs shake\nwater off wet fur. Salmon swim upstream to spawn, and spiders spin intricate webs. What do these\nseemingly unrelated behaviors have in common? They all are unlearned behaviors. Both instincts and\nreflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with. Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a\nspecificstimulusintheenvironment.Theytendtobesimplerthaninstincts,involvetheactivityofspecific\nbody parts and systems (e.g., the knee-jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light), and\ninvolve more primitive centers of the central nervous system (e.g., the spinal cord and the medulla).

As we discussed briefly in the previous section,\nclassicalconditioningisaprocessbywhichwelearntoassociatestimuliand,consequently,toanticipate\nevents.\nFigure 6.3 Ivan Pavlov\u2019s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning\nprocess now known as classical conditioning.\nPavlov came to his conclusions about how learning occurs completely by accident. Pavlov was a\nphysiologist, not a psychologist. Physiologists study the life processes of organisms, from the molecular\nleveltothelevelofcells,organsystems,andentireorganisms.Pavlov\u2019sareaofinterestwasthedigestive\nsystem (Hunt, 2007). In his studies with dogs, Pavlov surgically implanted tubes inside dogs\u2019 cheeks to\ncollect saliva. Hethenmeasured theamount ofsaliva produced inresponse tovarious foods. Overtime,\nPavlov (1927) observed that the dogs began to salivate not only at the taste of food, but also at the sight\noffood,atthesightofanemptyfoodbowl,andevenatthesoundofthelaboratoryassistants'footsteps.\nSalivating to food in the mouth is reflexive, so no learning is involved. However, dogs don\u2019t naturally\nsalivate at the sight of an empty bowl or the sound of footsteps.\nTheseunusualresponsesintriguedPavlov,andhewonderedwhataccountedforwhathecalledthedogs'\n\u201cpsychicsecretions\u201d(Pavlov,1927).Toexplorethisphenomenoninanobjectivemanner,Pavlovdesigned\naseriesofcarefullycontrolledexperimentstoseewhichstimuliwouldcausethedogstosalivate.Hewas\nabletotrainthedogstosalivateinresponsetostimulithatclearlyhadnothingtodowithfood,suchasthe\nsoundofabell,alight,andatouchontheleg.Throughhisexperiments,Pavlovrealizedthatanorganism\nhas two types of responses to its environment: (1) unconditioned (unlearned) responses, or reflexes, and\n(2) conditioned (learned) responses.\nIn Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them. The meat\npowderinthissituationwasanunconditionedstimulus(UCS):astimulusthatelicitsareflexiveresponse\nin an organism. The dogs\u2019 salivation was an unconditioned response (UCR): a natural (unlearned)\nreaction to a given stimulus. Before conditioning, think of the dogs\u2019 stimulus and response like this:\nMeat powder (UCS) \u2192 Salivation (UCR)\nIn classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is presented immediately before an unconditioned stimulus.\nPavlovwouldsoundatone(likeringingabell)andthengivethedogsthemeatpowder(Figure6.4).The\ntonewastheneutralstimulus(NS),whichisastimulusthatdoesnotnaturallyelicitaresponse.Priorto\nconditioning,thedogsdidnotsalivatewhentheyjustheardthetonebecausethetonehadnoassociation\nfor the dogs.

During conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus (food) is\npresented repeatedly just after the presentation of the neutral stimulus (bell). After conditioning, the neutral stimulus\nalone produces a conditioned response (salivation), thus becoming a conditioned stimulus.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNow that you have learned about the process of classical conditioning, do you think\nyou can condition Pavlov\u2019s dog?

These stingrays have\nbeen classically conditioned to associate the sound of a boat motor with food provided by tourists. (credit:\nKathryn Dumper)\nClassical conditioning also applies to humans, even babies. For example, Sara buys formula in blue\ncanisters for her six-month-old daughter, Angelina. Whenever Sara takes out a formula container,\nAngelina gets excited, tries to reach toward the food, and most likely salivates. Why does Angelina get\nexcited when she sees the formula canister? What are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR here?\nSo far, all of the examples have involved food, but classical conditioning extends beyond the basic need\nto be fed. Consider our earlier example of a dog whose owners install an invisible electric dog fence.\nA small electrical shock (unconditioned stimulus) elicits discomfort (unconditioned response). When the\nunconditioned stimulus (shock) ispairedwithaneutralstimulus (theedgeofayard),thedog associates\nthediscomfort(unconditionedresponse)withtheedgeoftheyard(conditionedstimulus)andstayswithin\nthesetboundaries.Inthisexample,theedgeoftheyardelicitsfearandanxietyinthedog.Fearandanxiety\nare the conditioned response.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor a humorous look at conditioning, watch thisvideo clip\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/theoffice)from the television showThe Office, where\nJim conditions Dwight to expect a breath mint every time Jim\u2019s computer makes a\nspecific sound. 192 Chapter 6 | Learning\nGENERAL PROCESSES IN CLASSICAL CONDITIONING\nNowthatyouknowhowclassicalconditioningworksandhaveseenseveralexamples,let\u2019stakealookat\nsome of the general processes involved. In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known\nas acquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus.\nDuring acquisition, the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response, and eventually the\nneutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself.\nTiming is important for conditioning to occur. Typically, there should only be a brief interval between\npresentation of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. Depending on what is being\nconditioned,sometimesthisintervalisaslittleasfiveseconds(Chance,2009).However,withothertypes\nof conditioning, the interval can be up to several hours.\nTaste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the\nconditionedstimulus(somethingingested)andtheunconditionedstimulus(nauseaorillness).Here\u2019show\nit works. Between classes, you and a friend grab a quick lunch from a food cart on campus. You share a\ndishofchickencurryandheadofftoyournextclass.Afewhourslater,youfeelnauseousandbecomeill.\nAlthough your friend is fine and you determine that you have intestinal flu (the food is not the culprit),\nyou\u2019ve developed a taste aversion; the next time you are at a restaurant and someone orders curry, you\nimmediatelyfeelill.Whilethechickendishisnotwhatmadeyousick,youareexperiencingtasteaversion:\nyou\u2019ve been conditioned to be averse to a food after a single, negative experience.\nHow does this occur\u2014conditioning based on a single instance and involving an extended time lapse\nbetweentheeventandthenegativestimulus?Researchintotasteaversionsuggeststhatthisresponsemay\nbe an evolutionary adaptation designed to help organisms quickly learn to avoid harmful foods (Garcia\n& Rusiniak, 1980; Garcia & Koelling, 1966). Not only may this contribute to species survival via natural\nselection,butitmayalsohelpusdevelopstrategiesforchallengessuchashelpingcancerpatientsthrough\nthenauseainducedbycertaintreatments(Holmes,1993;Jacobsenetal.,1993;Hutton,Baracos,&Wismer,\n2007; Skolin et al., 2006).\nOnce we have established the connection between the unconditioned stimulus and the conditioned\nstimulus, how do we break that connection and get the dog, cat, or child to stop responding? In Tiger\u2019s\ncase,imaginewhatwouldhappenifyoustoppedusingtheelectriccanopenerforherfoodandbeganto\nuseitonlyforhumanfood.Now,Tigerwouldhearthecanopener,butshewouldnotgetfood.Inclassical\nconditioning terms, you would be giving the conditioned stimulus, but not the unconditioned stimulus.\nPavlovexploredthisscenarioinhisexperimentswithdogs:soundingthetonewithoutgivingthedogsthe\nmeatpowder.Soonthedogsstoppedrespondingtothetone.Extinctionisthedecreaseintheconditioned\nresponse when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus. When\npresentedwiththeconditionedstimulusalone,thedog,cat,orotherorganismwouldshowaweakerand\nweaker response, and finally no response. In classical conditioning terms, there is a gradual weakening\nand disappearance of the conditioned response.\nWhat happens when learning is not used for a while\u2014when what was learned lies dormant? As we\njust discussed, Pavlov found that when he repeatedly presented the bell (conditioned stimulus) without\nthe meat powder (unconditioned stimulus), extinction occurred; the dogs stopped salivating to the bell.\nHowever,afteracoupleofhoursofrestingfromthisextinctiontraining,thedogsagainbegantosalivate\nwhen Pavlov rang the bell. What do you think would happen with Tiger\u2019s behavior if your electric can\nopenerbroke,andyoudidnotuseitforseveralmonths?Whenyoufinallygotitfixedandstartedusing\nit to open Tiger\u2019s food again, Tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her\nfood\u2014shewouldgetexcitedandruntothekitchenwhensheheardthesound.ThebehaviorofPavlov\u2019s\ndogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called spontaneous recovery: the return of a previously\nextinguished conditioned response following a rest period (Figure 6.7).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 6 | Learning 193\nFigure 6.7 This is the curve of acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery. The rising curve shows the\nconditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the\nunconditioned stimulus (acquisition). Then the curve decreases, which shows how the conditioned response weakens\nwhen only the conditioned stimulus is presented (extinction). After a break or pause from conditioning, the\nconditioned response reappears (spontaneous recovery).\nOfcourse,theseprocessesalsoapplyinhumans.Forexample,let\u2019ssaythateverydaywhenyouwalkto\ncampus,anicecreamtruckpassesyourroute.Dayafterday,youhearthetruck\u2019smusic(neutralstimulus),\nsoyoufinallystopandpurchaseachocolateicecreambar.Youtakeabite(unconditionedstimulus)and\nthenyourmouthwaters(unconditionedresponse).Thisinitialperiodoflearningisknownasacquisition,\nwhenyoubegintoconnecttheneutralstimulus(thesoundofthetruck)andtheunconditionedstimulus\n(the taste of the chocolate ice cream in your mouth).

Your mouth begins to water again. Why? After a break from conditioning,\nthe conditioned response reappears, which indicates spontaneous recovery.\nAcquisition and extinction involve the strengthening and weakening, respectively, of a learned\nassociation. Two other learning processes\u2014stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalization\u2014are\ninvolvedindistinguishingwhichstimuliwilltriggerthelearnedassociation.Animals(includinghumans)\nneed to distinguish between stimuli\u2014for example, between sounds that predict a threatening event and\nsounds that do not\u2014so that they can respond appropriately (such as running away if the sound is\nthreatening).Whenanorganismlearnstoresponddifferentlytovariousstimulithataresimilar,itiscalled\nstimulus discrimination. In classical conditioning terms, the organism demonstrates the conditioned\nresponse only to the conditioned stimulus. Pavlov\u2019s dogs discriminated between the basic tone that\nsoundedbeforetheywerefedandothertones(e.g.,thedoorbell),becausetheothersoundsdidnotpredict 194 Chapter 6 | Learning\nthe arrival of food. Similarly, Tiger, the cat, discriminated between the sound of the can opener and the\nsoundoftheelectricmixer.Whentheelectricmixerisgoing,Tigerisnotabouttobefed,soshedoesnot\ncome running to the kitchen looking for food.\nOntheotherhand,whenanorganismdemonstratestheconditionedresponsetostimulithataresimilarto\nthe condition stimulus, it is called stimulus generalization, the opposite of stimulus discrimination. The\nmoresimilarastimulusistotheconditionstimulus,themorelikelytheorganismistogivetheconditioned\nresponse.Forinstance,iftheelectricmixersoundsverysimilartotheelectriccanopener,Tigermaycome\nrunning after hearing its sound. But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound, and you\ncontinuetofeedherconsistentlyaftertheelectriccanopenersound,shewillquicklylearntodiscriminate\nbetween the two sounds (provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart).\nSometimes, classical conditioning can lead to habituation. Habituation occurs when we learn not to\nrespondtoastimulusthatispresentedrepeatedlywithoutchange.Asthestimulusoccursoverandover,\nwelearnnottofocusourattentiononit.Forexample,imaginethatyourneighbororroommateconstantly\nhasthetelevisionblaring.Thisbackgroundnoiseisdistractingandmakesitdifficultforyoutofocuswhen\nyou\u2019restudying.However,overtime,youbecomeaccustomedtothestimulusofthetelevisionnoise,and\neventually you hardly notice it any longer.\nBEHAVIORISM\nJohn B. Watson, shown in Figure 6.8, is considered the founder of behaviorism. Behaviorism is a school\nof thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century, which incorporates elements of Pavlov\u2019s\nclassicalconditioning(Hunt,2007).InstarkcontrastwithFreud,whoconsideredthereasonsforbehavior\nto be hidden in the unconscious, Watson championed the idea that all behavior can be studied as a\nsimplestimulus-responsereaction,withoutregardforinternalprocesses.Watsonarguedthatinorderfor\npsychology to become a legitimate science, it must shift its concern away from internal mental processes\nbecausementalprocessescannotbeseenormeasured.Instead,heassertedthatpsychologymustfocuson\noutward observable behavior that can be measured.\nFigure 6.8 John B. Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion.\nWatson\u2019sideaswereinfluencedbyPavlov\u2019swork.AccordingtoWatson,humanbehavior,justlikeanimal\nbehavior,isprimarilytheresultofconditionedresponses.WhereasPavlov\u2019sworkwithdogsinvolvedthe\nconditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of\nhuman emotions (Watson, 1919). Thus began Watson\u2019s work with his graduate student Rosalie Rayner\nand a baby called Little Albert. Through their experiments with Little Albert, Watson and Rayner (1920)\ndemonstrated how fears can be conditioned.\nIn 1920, Watson was the chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University.

He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the\nhelp of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to associate these stimuli with an emotion\u2014fear.

Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex\nautomatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the\nsecond type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to\nassociate a behavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more\nlikelytoberepeatedinthefuture.Forexample,Spirit,adolphinattheNationalAquariuminBaltimore,\ndoes a flip in the air when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish.\nTable 6.1Classical and Operant Conditioning Compared\nClassical Conditioning Operant Conditioning\nConditioning An unconditioned stimulus (such as The target behavior is followed by\napproach food) is paired with a neutral reinforcement or punishment to\nstimulus (such as a bell). The neutral either strengthen or weaken it, so\nstimulus eventually becomes the that the learner is more likely to\nconditioned stimulus, which brings exhibit the desired behavior in the\nabout the conditioned response future.\n(salivation).\nStimulus timing The stimulus occurs immediately The stimulus (either reinforcement\nbefore the response. or punishment) occurs soon after the\nresponse.\nPsychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are\nreflexivelyelicited,anditdoesn\u2019taccountfornewbehaviorssuchasridingabike.Heproposedatheory\nabout how such behaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences\nwe receive for the behavior: the reinforcements and punishments.

In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean\ngood and bad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking\nsomething away. Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are\ndecreasing a behavior. Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive\nor negative. All reinforcers (positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All\npunishers (positive or negative) decrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let\u2019s combine\nthese four terms: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative\npunishment (Table 6.2). 198 Chapter 6 | Learning\nTable 6.2Positive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment\nReinforcement Punishment\nPositive Something isaddedtoincreasethe Something isaddedtodecreasethe\nlikelihood of a behavior. likelihood of a behavior.\nNegative Something isremovedtoincreasethe Something isremovedtodecreasethe\nlikelihood of a behavior. likelihood of a behavior.\nREINFORCEMENT\nThe most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In\npositive reinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.\nFor example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome\nquickly cleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let\u2019s pause for a moment. Some people might\nsay, \u201cWhy should I reward my child for doing what is expected?\u201d But in fact we are constantly and\nconsistently rewarded in our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into\nour preferred school. Being praised for doing a good job and for passing a driver\u2019s test is also a reward.\nPositive reinforcement as a learning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most\neffective ways to increase achievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay\nthechildrentoread.Specifically,second-gradestudentsinDallaswerepaid$2eachtimetheyreadabook\nand passed a short quiz about the book. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension\n(Fryer, 2010). What do you think about this program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably\nthink this was a great idea. He was a strong proponent of using operant conditioning principles to\ninfluence students\u2019 behavior at school. In fact, in addition to the Skinner box, he also invented what\nhe called a teaching machine that was designed to reward small steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)\u2014an\nearly forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teaching machine tested students\u2019 knowledge as\nthey worked through various school subjects. If students answered questions correctly, they received\nimmediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered incorrectly, they did not receive\nany reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional time studying the material to\nincrease their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).\nIn negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, car\nmanufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go \u201cbeep,\nbeep, beep\u201d until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired\nbehavior, increasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative reinforcement is also\nusedfrequentlyinhorsetraining.Ridersapplypressure\u2014bypullingthereinsorsqueezingtheirlegs\u2014and\nthenremovethepressurewhenthehorseperformsthedesiredbehavior,suchasturningorspeedingup.\nThe pressure is the negative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.\nPUNISHMENT\nManypeopleconfusenegativereinforcementwithpunishmentinoperantconditioning,buttheyaretwo\nvery different mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a\nbehavior. In contrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an\nundesirablestimulustodecreaseabehavior.Anexampleofpositivepunishmentisscoldingastudentto\ngetthestudenttostoptextinginclass.Inthiscase,astimulus(thereprimand)isaddedinordertodecrease\nthe behavior (texting in class). In negative punishment, you remove an aversive stimulus to decrease\nbehavior. For example, when a child misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a\nstimulus (the toy) is removed in order to decrease the behavior.\nPunishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 6 | Learning 199\nimagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times\n\u201cI will not hit my brother\" (positive punishment). Chances are he won\u2019t repeat this behavior. While\nstrategies like this are common today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment,\nsuch as spanking. It\u2019s important to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on\nchildren. First, punishment may teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may\nbecome fearful of the person who delivered the punishment\u2014you, his parent. Similarly, children who\nare punished by teachers may come to fear the teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010).\nConsequently,mostschoolsintheUnitedStateshavebannedcorporalpunishment.Second,punishment\nmay cause children to become more aggressive and prone to antisocial behavior and delinquency\n(Gershoff,2002).Theyseetheirparentsresorttospankingwhentheybecomeangryandfrustrated,so,in\nturn,theymayactoutthissamebehaviorwhentheybecomeangryandfrustrated.Forexample,because\nyou spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she might start hitting her friends\nwhen they won\u2019t share their toys.\nWhile positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment\nshouldbeweighedagainstthepossiblenegativeeffects.Today\u2019spsychologistsandparentingexpertsfavor\nreinforcement over punishment\u2014they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and\nreward her for it.\nShaping\nIn his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of\nrewardingonlythetargetbehavior,inshaping,werewardsuccessiveapproximationsofatargetbehavior.\nWhy is shaping needed? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first\ndisplay the behavior. Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display\nanythingbutthesimplestofbehaviorsspontaneously.Inshaping,behaviorsarebrokendownintomany\nsmall, achievable steps. The specific steps used in the process are the following:\n1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.\n2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer\nreinforce the previously reinforced response.\n3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.\n4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.\n5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.\nShaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to\nteachpigeonsnotonlysuchrelativelysimplebehaviorsaspeckingadiskinaSkinnerbox,butalsomany\nunusualandentertainingbehaviors,suchasturningincircles,walkinginfigureeights,andevenplaying\nping pong; the technique is commonly used by animal trainers today. An important part of shaping is\nstimulus discrimination. Recall Pavlov\u2019s dogs\u2014he trained them to respond to the tone of a bell, and not\nto similar tones or sounds. This discrimination is also important in operant conditioning and in shaping\nbehavior.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHere is abrief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/pingpong)of Skinner\u2019s pigeons\nplaying ping pong. 200 Chapter 6 | Learning\nIt\u2019seasytoseehowshapingiseffectiveinteachingbehaviorstoanimals,buthowdoesshapingworkwith\nhumans?Let\u2019sconsiderparentswhosegoalistohavetheirchildlearntocleanhisroom.Theyuseshaping\ntohelphimmasterstepstowardthegoal.Insteadofperformingtheentiretask,theysetupthesestepsand\nreinforceeachstep.First,hecleansuponetoy.Second,hecleansupfivetoys.Third,hechooseswhether\nto pick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away.

If you were on a remote island in the middle of the\nPacificOceanandyouhadstacksofmoney,themoneywouldnotbeusefulifyoucouldnotspendit.What\nabout the stickers on the behavior chart? They also are secondary reinforcers.\nSometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used. Tokens, which are also secondary\nreinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes. Entire behavior management systems, known\nas token economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers. Token economies have\nbeen found to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as schools, prisons,\nandmentalhospitals.Forexample,astudybyCangiandDaly(2013)foundthatuseofatokeneconomy\nincreasedappropriatesocialbehaviorsandreducedinappropriatebehaviorsinagroupofautisticschool\nchildren. Autistic children tend to exhibit disruptive behaviors such as pinching and hitting. When the\nchildren in the study exhibited appropriate behavior (not hitting or pinching), they received a \u201cquiet\nhands\u201d token. When they hit or pinched, they lost a token. The children could then exchange specified\namounts of tokens for minutes of playtime.\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\nBehavior Modification in Children\nParents and teachers often use behavior modification to change a child\u2019s behavior.

When a child\nmisbehaves, he or she is removed from a desirable activity in an effort to decrease the unwanted behavior.\nFor example, (a) a child might be playing on the playground with friends and push another child; (b) the child\nwho misbehaved would then be removed from the activity for a short period of time.

In partial reinforcement, also referred to as intermittent reinforcement,\nthe person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior. There are\nseveral different types of partial reinforcement schedules (Table 6.3). These schedules are described as\neither fixed or variable, and as either interval or ratio. Fixed refers to the number of responses between\nreinforcements, or the amount of time between reinforcements, which is set and unchanging. Variable\nrefers to the number of responses or amount of time between reinforcements, which varies or changes.\nIntervalmeansthescheduleisbasedonthetimebetweenreinforcements,andratiomeansthescheduleis\nbased on the number of responses between reinforcements.\nTable 6.3Reinforcement Schedules\nReinforcement Description Result Example\nSchedule\nFixed interval Reinforcement is Moderate response rate Hospital patient uses\ndelivered at predictable with significant pauses patient-controlled,\ntime intervals (e.g., after after reinforcement doctor-timed pain relief\n5, 10, 15, and 20\nminutes).\nVariable Reinforcement is Moderate yet steady Checking Facebook\ninterval delivered at response rate\nunpredictable time\nintervals (e.g., after 5, 7,\n10, and 20 minutes).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 6 | Learning 203\nTable 6.3Reinforcement Schedules\nReinforcement Description Result Example\nSchedule\nFixed ratio Reinforcement is High response rate with Piecework\u2014factory\ndelivered after a pauses after worker getting paid for\npredictable number of reinforcement every x number of items\nresponses (e.g., after 2, 4, manufactured\n6, and 8 responses).\nVariable ratio Reinforcement is High and steady Gambling\ndelivered after an response rate\nunpredictable number of\nresponses (e.g., after 1, 4,\n5, and 9 responses).\nNow let\u2019s combine these four terms. A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is\nrewarded after a set amount of time. For example, June undergoes major surgery in a hospital. During\nrecovery,sheisexpectedtoexperiencepainandwillrequireprescriptionmedicationsforpainrelief.June\nis given an IV drip with a patient-controlled painkiller. Her doctor sets a limit: one dose per hour. June\npushes a button when pain becomes difficult, and she receives a dose of medication. Since the reward\n(painrelief)onlyoccursonafixedinterval,thereisnopointinexhibitingthebehaviorwhenitwillnotbe\nrewarded.\nWith a variable interval reinforcement schedule, the person or animal gets the reinforcement based\non varying amounts of time, which are unpredictable. Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast-food\nrestaurant.EveryonceinawhilesomeonefromthequalitycontroldivisioncomestoManuel\u2019srestaurant.\nIf the restaurant is clean and the service is fast, everyone on that shift earns a $20 bonus. Manuel never\nknowswhenthequalitycontrolpersonwillshowup,sohealwaystriestokeeptherestaurantcleanand\nensures that his employees provide prompt and courteous service. His productivity regarding prompt\nservice and keeping a clean restaurant are steady because he wants his crew to earn the bonus.\nWith a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule, there are a set number of responses that must occur before\nthebehaviorisrewarded.Carlasellsglassesataneyeglassstore,andsheearnsacommissioneverytime\nshe sells a pair of glasses. She always tries to sell people more pairs of glasses, including prescription\nsunglasses or a backup pair, so she can increase her commission. She does not care if the person really\nneeds the prescription sunglasses, Carla just wants her bonus. The quality of what Carla sells does not\nmatter because her commission is not based on quality; it\u2019s only based on the number of pairs sold.\nThis distinction in the quality of performance can help determine which reinforcement method is most\nappropriate for a particular situation. Fixed ratios are better suited to optimize the quantity of output,\nwhereas a fixed interval, in which the reward is not quantity based, can lead to a higher quality of output.\nIn a variable ratio reinforcement schedule, the number of responses needed for a reward varies.

The variable ratio schedule is\nunpredictable and yields high and steady response rates, with little if any pause after reinforcement (e.g., gambler). A\nfixed ratio schedule is predictable and produces a high response rate, with a short pause after reinforcement (e.g.,\neyeglass saleswoman). The variable interval schedule is unpredictable and produces a moderate, steady response\nrate (e.g., restaurant manager). The fixed interval schedule yields a scallop-shaped response pattern, reflecting a\nsignificant pause after reinforcement (e.g., surgery patient).\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\nGambling and the Brain\nSkinner(1953)stated,\u201cIfthegamblingestablishmentcannotpersuadeapatrontoturnovermoneywithnoreturn,\nit may achieve the same effect by returning part of the patron's money on a variable-ratio schedule\u201d (p. 397).\nSkinnerusesgamblingasanexampleofthepowerandeffectivenessofconditioningbehaviorbasedonavariable\nratio reinforcement schedule.

Research has shown that some pathological gamblers have lower levels\nof the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) known as norepinephrine than do normal gamblers (Roy, et al., 1988).\nAccording to a study conducted by Alec Roy and colleagues, norepinephrine is secreted when a person feels\nstress, arousal, or thrill; pathological gamblers use gambling to increase their levels of this neurotransmitter.\nAnotherresearcher,neuroscientistHansBreiter,hasdoneextensiveresearchongamblinganditseffectsonthe\nbrain.Breiter(ascitedinFranzen,2001)reportsthat\u201cMonetaryrewardinagambling-likeexperimentproduces\nbrain activation very similar to that observed in a cocaine addict receiving an infusion of cocaine\u201d (para. 1).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 6 | Learning 205\nDeficiencies in serotonin (another neurotransmitter) might also contribute to compulsive behavior, including a\ngambling addiction.\nItmaybethatpathologicalgamblers\u2019brainsaredifferentthanthoseofotherpeople,andperhapsthisdifference\nmaysomehowhaveledtotheirgamblingaddiction,asthesestudiesseemtosuggest.However,itisverydifficult\ntoascertainthecausebecauseitisimpossibletoconductatrueexperiment(itwouldbeunethicaltotrytoturn\nrandomlyassignedparticipantsintoproblemgamblers).Therefore,itmaybethatcausationactuallymovesinthe\nopposite direction\u2014perhaps the act of gambling somehow changes neurotransmitter levels in some gamblers\u2019\nbrains.Italsoispossiblethatsomeoverlookedfactor,orconfoundingvariable,playedaroleinboththegambling\naddiction and the differences in brain chemistry.\nFigure 6.14 Some research suggests that pathological gamblers use gambling to compensate for abnormally\nlow levels of the hormone norepinephrine, which is associated with stress and is secreted in moments of arousal\nand thrill.

Tolman, had a\ndifferent opinion. Tolman\u2019s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they\ndo not receive immediate reinforcement (Tolman & Honzik, 1930; Tolman, Ritchie, & Kalish, 1946). This\nfindingwasinconflictwiththeprevailingideaatthetimethatreinforcementmustbeimmediateinorder\nfor learning to occur, thus suggesting a cognitive aspect to learning.\nIn the experiments, Tolman placed hungry rats in a maze with no reward for finding their way through\nit. He also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze. As the\nunreinforced rats explored the maze, they developed a cognitive map: a mental picture of the layout of\nthe maze (Figure 6.15). After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement, food was placed in a goal\nboxattheendofthemaze.Assoonastheratsbecameawareofthefood,theywereabletofindtheirway\nthroughthemazequickly,justasquicklyasthecomparisongroup,whichhadbeenrewardedwithfoodall\nalong.Thisisknownaslatentlearning:learningthatoccursbutisnotobservableinbehavioruntilthere\nis a reason to demonstrate it. 206 Chapter 6 | Learning\nFigure 6.15 Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze. Have you\never worked your way through various levels on a video game? You learned when to turn left or right, move up or\ndown. In that case you were relying on a cognitive map, just like the rats in a maze. (credit: modification of work by\n\"FutUndBeidl\"/Flickr)\nLatent learning also occurs in humans. Children may learn by watching the actions of their parents but\nonlydemonstrateitatalaterdate,whenthelearnedmaterialisneeded.Forexample,supposethatRavi\u2019s\ndad drives him to school every day. In this way, Ravi learns the route from his house to his school, but\nhe\u2019sneverdriventherehimself,sohehasnothadachancetodemonstratethathe\u2019slearnedtheway.One\nmorningRavi\u2019sdadhastoleaveearlyforameeting,sohecan\u2019tdriveRavitoschool.Instead,Ravifollows\nthe same route on his bike that his dad would have taken in the car. This demonstrates latent learning.\nRavi had learned the route to school, but had no need to demonstrate this knowledge earlier.\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\nThis Place Is Like a Maze\nHave you ever gotten lost in a building and couldn\u2019t find your way back out?

In observational learning, we learn by watching others and then imitating, or\nmodeling, what they do or say. The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models.\nResearch suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron, called a mirror neuron\n(Hickock, 2010; Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi, & Gallese, 2002; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese, 2006).\nHumansandotheranimalsarecapableofobservationallearning.Asyouwillsee,thephrase\u201cmonkeysee,\nmonkey do\u201d really is accurate (Figure 6.16). The same could be said about other animals. For example,\nin a study of social learning in chimpanzees, researchers gave juice boxes with straws to two groups of\ncaptive chimpanzees. The first group dipped the straw into the juice box, and then sucked on the small\namountofjuiceattheendofthestraw.Thesecondgroupsuckedthroughthestrawdirectly,gettingmuch\nmore juice.

There are three main types\nof learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and\noperant conditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that\noccur together. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.\n6.2Classical Conditioning\nPavlov\u2019spioneeringworkwithdogscontributedgreatlytowhatweknowaboutlearning.Hisexperiments\nexplored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning.

An animal or a human\nreceives a consequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or\na punisher. All reinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response.\nAll punishment (positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of\nreinforcement schedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.\n6.4Observational Learning (Modeling)\nAccording to Bandura, learning can occur by watching others and then modeling what they do or say.\nThis is known as observational learning. There are specific steps in the process of modeling that must\nbe followed if learning is to be successful. These steps include attention, retention, reproduction, and\nmotivation. Through modeling, Bandura has shown that children learn many things both good and bad\nsimply by watching their parents, siblings, and others.\nReview Questions\n1.

Can you get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school\nis done? These thoughts are one example of cognition at work. Exceptionally complex, cognition is an\nessential feature of human consciousness, yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced.\nCognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think. It attempts\nto explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking,\nemotion, creativity, language, and problem solving, in addition to other cognitive processes.

To make this process more complex, the brain does not gather information from external\nenvironments only. When thoughts are formed, the brain also pulls information from emotions and\nmemories(Figure7.2).Emotionandmemoryarepowerfulinfluencesonbothourthoughtsandbehaviors.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence 219\nFigure 7.2 Sensations and information are received by our brains, filtered through emotions and memories, and\nprocessed to become thoughts.\nInordertoorganizethisstaggeringamountofinformation,thebrainhasdevelopedafilecabinetofsorts\nin the mind. The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts. Concepts are categories or\ngroupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. Concepts are,\nin many ways, big ideas that are generated by observing details, and categorizing and combining these\ndetailsintocognitivestructures.Youuseconceptstoseetherelationshipsamongthedifferentelementsof\nyour experiences and to keep the information in your mind organized and accessible.\nConcepts are informed by our semantic memory (you will learn more about semantic memory in a later\nchapter)andarepresentineveryaspectofourlives;however,oneoftheeasiestplacestonoticeconcepts\nis inside a classroom, where they are discussed explicitly. When you study United States history, for\nexample, you learn about more than just individual events that have happened in America\u2019s past.

In psychology,\nfor example, Piaget\u2019s stages of development are abstract concepts. Some concepts, like tolerance, are\nagreed upon by many people, because they have been used in various ways over many years.

Her peaceful resistance to\nsegregation on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, is a recognizable example of civil disobedience.\nOr your prototype could be Mohandas Gandhi, sometimes called Mahatma Gandhi (\u201cMahatma\u201d is an\nhonorific title) (Figure 7.3). 220 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nFigure 7.3 In 1930, Mohandas Gandhi led a group in peaceful protest against a British tax on salt in India.\nMohandas Gandhi served as a nonviolent force for independence for India while simultaneously\ndemanding that Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian leaders\u2014both Indian and British\u2014collaborate\npeacefully. Although he was not always successful in preventing violence around him, his life provides\na steadfast example of the civil disobedience prototype (Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2013).

Natural concepts\nare created \u201cnaturally\u201d through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect\nexperiences. For example, if you live in Essex Junction, Vermont, you have probably had a lot of direct\nexperience with snow. You\u2019ve watched it fall from the sky, you\u2019ve seen lightly falling snow that barely\ncovers the windshield of your car, and you\u2019ve shoveled out 18 inches of fluffy white snow as you\u2019ve\nthought,\u201cThisisperfectforskiing.\u201dYou\u2019vethrownsnowballsatyourbestfriendandgonesleddingdown\nthe steepest hill in town. In short, you know snow. You know what it looks like, smells like, tastes like,\nand feels like. If, however, you\u2019ve lived your whole life on the island of Saint Vincent in the Caribbean,\nyou may never have actually seen snow, much less tasted, smelled, or touched it. You know snow from\nthe indirect experience of seeing pictures of falling snow\u2014or from watching films that feature snow as\npartofthesetting.Eitherway,snowisanaturalconceptbecauseyoucanconstructanunderstandingofit\nthrough direct observations or experiences of snow (Figure 7.4).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence 221\nFigure 7.4 (a) Our concept of snow is an example of a natural concept\u2014one that we understand through direct\nobservation and experience. (b) In contrast, artificial concepts are ones that we know by a specific set of\ncharacteristics that they always exhibit, such as what defines different basic shapes. (credit a: modification of work by\nMaarten Takens; credit b: modification of work by \u201cShayan (USA)\u201d/Flickr)\nAn artificial concept, on the other hand, is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics.\nVarious properties of geometric shapes, like squares and triangles, serve as useful examples of artificial\nconcepts. A triangle always has three angles and three sides. A square always has four equal sides and\nfourrightangles.Mathematicalformulas,liketheequationforarea(length\u00d7width)areartificialconcepts\ndefined by specific sets of characteristics that are always the same.

When a schema is\nactivated, the brain makes immediate assumptions about the person or object being observed.\nThereareseveraltypesofschemata.Aroleschemamakesassumptionsabouthowindividualsincertain\nroles will behave (Callero, 1994). For example, imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a\nfirefighter. When this happens, your brain automatically activates the \u201cfirefighter schema\u201d and begins\nmaking assumptions that this person is brave, selfless, and community-oriented. Despite not knowing\nthis person, already you have unknowingly made judgments about him. Schemata also help you fill in\ngapsintheinformationyoureceivefromtheworldaroundyou.Whileschemataallowformoreefficient\ninformation processing, there can be problems with schemata, regardless of whether they are accurate:\nPerhapsthisparticularfirefighterisnotbrave,hejustworksasafirefightertopaythebillswhilestudying\nto become a children\u2019s librarian.\nAneventschema,alsoknownasacognitivescript,isasetofbehaviorsthatcanfeellikearoutine.Think\nabout what you do when you walk into an elevator (Figure 7.5).

You never face the back of the elevator, do you? And\nwhen you\u2019re riding in a crowded elevator and you can\u2019t face the front, it feels uncomfortable, doesn\u2019t it?\nInterestingly,eventschematacanvarywidelyamongdifferentculturesandcountries.Forexample,while\nit is quite common for people to greet one another with a handshake in the United States, in Tibet, you\ngreetsomeonebystickingyourtongueoutatthem,andinBelize,youbumpfists(CairnsRegionalCouncil, 222 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nn.d.)\nFigure 7.5 What event schema do you perform when riding in an elevator?

This section will focus on what distinguishes language as a special form of\ncommunication, how the use of language develops, and how language affects the way we think.\nCOMPONENTS OF LANGUAGE\nLanguage,beitspoken,signed,orwritten,hasspecificcomponents:alexiconandgrammar.Lexiconrefers\nto the words of a given language. Thus, lexicon is a language\u2019s vocabulary. Grammar refers to the set\nof rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon (Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011). For\ninstance, English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an \u201c-ed\u201d at the end to indicate past tense.\nWordsareformedbycombiningthevariousphonemesthatmakeupthelanguage.Aphoneme(e.g.,the\nsounds \u201cah\u201d vs. \u201ceh\u201d) is a basic sound unit of a given language, and different languages have different\nsetsofphonemes.Phonemesarecombinedtoformmorphemes,whicharethesmallestunitsoflanguage\nthatconvey some typeofmeaning(e.g.,\u201cI\u201disbothaphonemeandamorpheme). Weusesemantics and\nsyntaxtoconstructlanguage.Semanticsandsyntaxarepartofalanguage\u2019sgrammar.Semanticsrefersto\ntheprocessbywhichwederivemeaningfrommorphemesandwords.Syntaxreferstothewaywordsare\norganized into sentences (Chomsky, 1965; Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011).\nWe apply the rules of grammar to organize the lexicon in novel and creative ways, which allow us to\ncommunicate information about both concrete and abstract concepts. We can talk about our immediate\nand observable surroundings as well as the surface of unseen planets. We can share our innermost\nthoughts, our plans for the future, and debate the value of a college education. We can provide detailed\ninstructions for cooking a meal, fixing a car, or building a fire. The flexibility that language provides to\nrelay vastly different types of information is a property that makes language so distinct as a mode of\ncommunication among humans.\nLANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT\nGiven the remarkable complexity of a language, one might expect that mastering a language would\nbe an especially arduous task; indeed, for those of us trying to learn a second language as adults, this\nmight seem to be true. However, young children master language very quickly with relative ease. B. F.\nSkinner(1957)proposedthatlanguageislearnedthroughreinforcement.NoamChomsky(1965)criticized\nthis behaviorist approach, asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are\nbiologically determined. The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears\nto follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. It would\nseem,therefore,thatwearebornwithabiological predisposition toacquirealanguage(Chomsky, 1965;\nFern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011). Moreover, it appears that there is a critical period for language acquisition, 224 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nsuchthatthisproficiencyatacquiringlanguageismaximalearlyinlife;generally,aspeopleage,theease\nwith which they acquire and master new languages diminishes (Johnson & Newport, 1989; Lenneberg,\n1967; Singleton, 1995).\nChildren begin to learn about language from a very early age (Table 7.1). In fact, it appears that this is\noccurringevenbeforeweareborn.Newbornsshowpreferencefortheirmother\u2019svoiceandappeartobe\nable to discriminate between the language spoken by their mother and other languages. Babies are also\nattunedtothelanguagesbeingusedaroundthemandshowpreferencesforvideosoffacesthataremoving\nin synchrony with the audio of spoken language versus videos that do not synchronize with the audio\n(Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).\nTable 7.1Stages of Language and Communication Development\nStage Age Developmental Language and Communication\n1 0\u20133 months Reflexive communication\n2 3\u20138 months Reflexive communication; interest in others\n3 8\u201313 months Intentional communication; sociability\n4 12\u201318 months First words\n5 18\u201324 months Simple sentences of two words\n6 2\u20133 years Sentences of three or more words\n7 3\u20135 years Complex sentences; has conversations\nDIG DEEPER\nThe Case of Genie\nIn the fall of 1970, a social worker in the Los Angeles area found a 13-year-old girl who was being raised in\nextremelyneglectfulandabusiveconditions.Thegirl,whocametobeknownasGenie,hadlivedmostofher\nlifetiedtoapottychairorconfinedtoacribinasmallroomthatwaskeptclosedwiththecurtainsdrawn.Fora\nlittleoveradecade,Geniehadvirtuallynosocialinteractionandnoaccesstotheoutsideworld.Asaresultof\ntheseconditions,Geniewasunabletostandup,chewsolidfood,orspeak(Fromkin,Krashen,Curtiss,Rigler,\n& Rigler, 1974; Rymer, 1993).

During this\ntime, children know a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child\u2019s early\nvocabularyislimitedtofamiliarobjectsorevents,oftennouns.Althoughchildreninthisstageonlymake\none-wordutterances,thesewordsoftencarrylargermeaning(Fern\u00e1ndez&Cairns,2011).So,forexample,\na child saying \u201ccookie\u201d could be identifying a cookie or asking for a cookie.\nAs a child\u2019s lexicon grows, she begins to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very\nrapid pace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that\napplytotheirlanguage(s).Eventhemistakesthatchildrensometimesmakeprovideevidenceofjusthow\nmuch they understand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In\nthis context, overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For\nexample, in English, it is usually the case that an \u201cs\u201d is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality.\nForexample,wespeakofonedogversustwodogs.Youngchildrenwillovergeneralizethisruletocases\nthatareexceptionstothe\u201caddanstotheendoftheword\u201druleandsaythingslike\u201cthosetwogooses\u201dor\n\u201cthree mouses.\u201d Clearly, the rules of the language are understood, even if the exceptions to the rules are\nstill being learned (Moskowitz, 1978).\nLANGUAGE AND THOUGHT\nWhenwespeakonelanguage,weagreethatwordsarerepresentationsofideas,people,places,andevents.\nThe given language that children learn is connected to their culture and surroundings. But can words\nthemselves shape the way we think about things? Psychologists have long investigated the question of\nwhetherlanguageshapesthoughtsandactions,orwhetherourthoughtsandbeliefsshapeourlanguage.\nTwo researchers, Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, began this investigation in the 1940s. They\nwanted to understand how the language habits of a community encourage members of that community\ntointerpretlanguageinaparticularmanner(Sapir,1941/1964).SapirandWhorfproposedthatlanguage\ndeterminesthought,suggesting,forexample,thatapersonwhosecommunitylanguagedidnothavepast-\ntenseverbswouldbechallengedtothinkaboutthepast(Whorf,1956).Researchers havesinceidentified\nthis view as too absolute, pointing out a lack of empiricism behind what Sapir and Whorf proposed\n(Abler, 2013; Boroditsky, 2011; van Troyer, 1994). Today, psychologists continue to study and debate the\nrelationship between language and thought. 226 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\nThe Meaning of Language\nThink about what you know of other languages; perhaps you even speak multiple languages. Imagine for\na moment that your closest friend fluently speaks more than one language. Do you think that friend thinks\ndifferently,dependingonwhichlanguageisbeingspoken?Youmayknowafewwordsthatarenottranslatable\nfrom their original language into English. For example, the Portuguese word saudade originated during the\n15th century, when Portuguese sailors left home to explore the seas and travel to Africa or Asia. Those left\nbehinddescribedtheemptiness andfondness theyfelt assaudade(Figure 7.7).Thewordcametoexpress\nmany meanings, including loss, nostalgia, yearning, warm memories, and hope. There is no single word in\nEnglish that includes all of those emotions in a single description. Do words such as saudade indicate that\ndifferent languages produce different patterns of thought in people? What do you think??\nFigure 7.7 These two works of art depictsaudade. (a)Saudade de N\u00e1poles, which is translated into\n\u201cmissing Naples,\u201d was painted by Bertha Worms in 1895. (b) Almeida J\u00fanior paintedSaudadein 1899.\nLanguage may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism. One\nrecent demonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin\nChinese speakers talk and think about time. English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that\ndescribe changes along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like \u201cI\u2019m running behind\nschedule\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in\nhorizontal terms, it is not uncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement. For\nexample,thepastmightbedescribedasbeing\u201cup\u201dandthefutureasbeing\u201cdown.\u201dItturnsoutthatthese\ndifferences in language translate into differences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure\nhow quickly an individual can recognize temporal relationships. Specifically, when given a series of\ntaskswithverticalpriming,MandarinChinesespeakerswerefasteratrecognizingtemporalrelationships\nbetween months. Indeed, Boroditsky (2001) sees these results as suggesting that \u201chabits in language\nencourage habits in thought\u201d (p. 12).\nOne group of researchers who wanted to investigate how language influences thought compared how\nEnglishspeakersandtheDanipeopleofPapuaNewGuineathinkandspeakaboutcolor.TheDanihave\ntwo words for color: one word for light and one word for dark.

However, the Dani were able to distinguish colors with the same ability as\nEnglish speakers, despite having fewer words at their disposal (Berlin & Kay, 1969). A recent review of\nresearch aimed at determining how language might affect something like color perception suggests that\nlanguage can influence perceptual phenomena, especially in the left hemisphere of the brain. You may\nrecallfromearlierchaptersthatthelefthemisphereisassociatedwithlanguageformostpeople.However,\nthe right (less linguistic hemisphere) of the brain is less affected by linguistic influences on perception\n(Regier & Kay, 2009)\n7.3 Problem Solving\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe problem solving strategies\n\u2022 Define algorithm and heuristic\n\u2022 Explain some common roadblocks to effective problem solving\nPeople face problems every day\u2014usually, multiple problems throughout the day.

The way that researchers have defined the concept of intelligence has been\nmodified many times since the birth of psychology. British psychologist Charles Spearman believed\nintelligence consisted of one general factor, called g, which could be measured and compared among\nindividuals. Spearman focused on the commonalities among various intellectual abilities and\ndemphasized what made each unique. Long before modern psychology developed, however, ancient\nphilosophers, such as Aristotle, held a similar view (Cianciolo & Sternberg, 2004).\nOthers psychologists believe that instead of a single factor, intelligence is a collection of distinct abilities.\nIn the 1940s, Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into\ntwo components: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence (Cattell, 1963). Crystallized intelligence\nis characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it. When you learn, remember, and\nrecallinformation,youareusingcrystallizedintelligence.Youusecrystallizedintelligenceallthetimein\nyourcoursework bydemonstrating thatyouhavemastered theinformation covered inthecourse. Fluid\nintelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems. Navigating your\nwayhomeafterbeingdetouredontoanunfamiliarroutebecauseofroadconstructionwoulddrawupon\nyourfluidintelligence.Fluidintelligencehelpsyoutacklecomplex,abstractchallengesinyourdailylife,\nwhereas crystallized intelligence helps you overcome concrete, straightforward problems (Cattell, 1963).\nOthertheoristsandpsychologistsbelievethatintelligenceshouldbedefinedinmorepracticalterms.For\nexample,whattypesofbehaviors helpyougetaheadinlife?Whichskillspromote success? Thinkabout\nthisforamoment.Beingabletoreciteall44presidentsoftheUnitedStatesinorderisanexcellentparty\ntrick, but will knowing this make you a better person?\nRobert Sternberg developed another theory of intelligence, which he titled the triarchic theory of\nintelligence because it sees intelligence as comprised of three parts (Sternberg, 1988): practical, creative, 234 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nand analytical intelligence (Figure 7.12).\nFigure 7.12 Sternberg\u2019s theory identifies three types of intelligence: practical, creative, and analytical.\nPracticalintelligence,asproposedbySternberg,issometimescomparedto\u201cstreetsmarts.\u201dBeingpractical\nmeans you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your\nexperiences. This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ;\nindividuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative\nand analytical intelligence (Sternberg, 1988).\nThis story about the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings illustrates both high and low practical intelligences.\nDuring the incident, one student left her class to go get a soda in an adjacent building. She planned to\nreturntoclass,butwhenshereturnedtoherbuildingaftergettinghersoda,shesawthatthedoorsheused\nto leave was now chained shut from the inside. Instead of thinking about why there was a chain around\nthe door handles, she went to her class\u2019s window and crawled back into the room. She thus potentially\nexposed herself to the gunman. Thankfully, she was not shot. On the other hand, a pair of students was\nwalkingoncampuswhentheyheardgunshotsnearby.Onefriendsaid,\u201cLet\u2019sgocheckitoutandseewhat\nis going on.\u201d The other student said, \u201cNo way, we need to run away from the gunshots.\u201d They did just\nthat.Asaresult,bothavoidedharm.Thestudentwhocrawledthroughthewindowdemonstratedsome\ncreativeintelligencebutdidnotusecommonsense.Shewouldhavelowpracticalintelligence.Thestudent\nwho encouraged his friend to run away from the sound of gunshots would have much higher practical\nintelligence.\nAnalytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations. Sternberg\nsays that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze, evaluate, judge, compare, and\ncontrast.Whenreadingaclassicnovelforliteratureclass,forexample,itisusuallynecessarytocompare\nthe motives of the main characters of the book or analyze the historical context of the story.

Gardner\u2019s theory, which has been refined for more than 30 years, is a more\nrecent development among theories of intelligence.

Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and\nothers, show empathy, understand social relationships and cues, and regulate your own emotions and\nrespond in culturally appropriate ways (Parker, Saklofske, & Stough, 2009). People with high emotional\nintelligence typically havewell-developed social skills. Some researchers, including DanielGoleman, the\nauthorofEmotionalIntelligence:WhyItCanMatterMorethanIQ,arguethatemotionalintelligenceisabetter\npredictor of success than traditional intelligence (Goleman, 1995). However, emotional intelligence has\nbeen widely debated, with researchers pointing out inconsistencies in how it is defined and described,\nas well as questioning results of studies on a subject that is difficulty to measure and study emperically\n(Locke, 2005; Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2004)\nIntelligencecanalsohavedifferentmeaningsandvaluesindifferentcultures.Ifyouliveonasmallisland, 236 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nwhere most people get their food by fishing from boats, it would be important to know how to fish\nand how to repair a boat.

Similarly, IQ tests\u2014the tools designed to measure intelligence\u2014have been\nthe subject of debate throughout their development and use.\nWhen might an IQ test be used? What do we learn from the results, and how might people use this\ninformation? IQ tests are expensive to administer and must be given by a licensed psychologist.\nIntelligence testing has been considered both a bane and a boon for education and social policy. In\nthis section, we will explore what intelligence tests measure, how they are scored, and how they were\ndeveloped.\nMEASURING INTELLIGENCE\nItseemsthatthehumanunderstandingofintelligenceissomewhatlimitedwhenwefocusontraditionalor\nacademic-typeintelligence.Howthen,canintelligencebemeasured?Andwhenwemeasureintelligence,\nhow do we ensure that we capture what we\u2019re really trying to measure (in other words, that IQ tests\nfunction as valid measures of intelligence)? In the following paragraphs, we will explore the how\nintelligence tests were developed and the history of their use.\nThe IQ test has been synonymous with intelligence for over a century. In the late 1800s, Sir Francis\nGalton developed the first broad test of intelligence (Flanagan & Kaufman, 2004). Although he was not\na psychologist, his contributions to the concepts of intelligence testing are still felt today (Gordon, 1995).\nReliableintelligencetesting(youmayrecallfromearlierchaptersthatreliabilityreferstoatest\u2019sabilityto\nproduceconsistentresults)beganinearnestduringtheearly1900switharesearchernamedAlfredBinet\n(Figure7.13).BinetwasaskedbytheFrenchgovernmenttodevelopanintelligencetesttouseonchildren\ntodeterminewhichonesmighthavedifficultyinschool;itincludedmanyverballybasedtasks.American\nresearchers soon realized the value of such testing. Louis Terman, a Stanford professor, modified Binet\u2019s\nwork by standardizing the administration of the test and tested thousands of different-aged children to\nestablishanaveragescoreforeachage.Asaresult,thetestwasnormedandstandardized,whichmeans\nthatthetestwasadministeredconsistentlytoalargeenoughrepresentativesampleofthepopulationthat\ntherangeofscoresresultedinabellcurve(bellcurveswillbediscussedlater).Standardizationmeansthat\nthemannerofadministration,scoring,andinterpretationofresultsisconsistent.Norminginvolvesgiving\natesttoalargepopulationsodatacanbecollectedcomparinggroups,suchasagegroups.Theresulting\ndataprovidenorms,orreferentialscores,bywhichtointerpretfuturescores.Normsarenotexpectations\nof what a given group should know but a demonstration of what that group does know. Norming and\nstandardizing the test ensures that new scores are reliable. This new version of the test was called the\nStanford-BinetIntelligenceScale(Terman,1916).Remarkably,anupdatedversionofthistestisstillwidely\nused today. 238 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nFigure 7.13 French psychologist Alfred Binet helped to develop intelligence testing. (b) This page is from a 1908\nversion of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale. Children being tested were asked which face, of each pair, was prettier.\nIn1939,DavidWechsler,apsychologistwhospentpartofhiscareerworkingwithWorldWarIveterans,\ndevelopedanewIQtestintheUnitedStates.Wechslercombinedseveralsubtestsfromotherintelligence\ntests used between 1880 and World War I. These subtests tapped into a variety of verbal and nonverbal\nskills, because Wechsler believed that intelligence encompassed \u201cthe global capacity of a person to act\npurposefully,tothinkrationally,andtodealeffectivelywithhisenvironment\u201d(Wechsler,1958,p.7).He\nnamed the test the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981). This combination of subtests\nbecameoneofthemostextensivelyusedintelligencetestsinthehistoryofpsychology.Althoughitsname\nwas later changed to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and has been revised several times,\nthe aims of the test remain virtually unchanged since its inception (Boake, 2002). Today, there are three\nintelligence tests credited to Wechsler, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-fourth edition (WAIS-IV),\nthe Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of\nIntelligence\u2014IV (WPPSI-IV) (Wechsler, 2012). These tests are used widely in schools and communities\nthroughout the United States, and they are periodically normed and standardized as a means of\nrecalibration.Interestingly,theperiodicrecalibrationshaveledtoaninterestingobservationknownasthe\nFlynn effect. Named after James Flynn, who was among the first to describe this trend, the Flynn effect\nrefers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last.

Where, however, should the lines of intellectual\ndisability be drawn? In May 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in a related case (Hall v. Florida) that IQ scores\ncannot be used as a final determination of a prisoner\u2019s eligibility for the death penalty (Roberts, 2014).\nTHE BELL CURVE\nTheresultsofintelligencetestsfollowthebellcurve,agraphinthegeneralshapeofabell.Whenthebell\ncurveisusedinpsychologicaltesting,thegraphdemonstratesanormaldistributionofatrait,inthiscase,\nintelligence, in the human population. Many human traits naturally follow the bell curve. For example,\nif you lined up all your female schoolmates according to height, it is likely that a large cluster of them\nwould be the average height for an American woman: 5\u20194\u201d\u20135\u20196\u201d.

Individuals earn a score called an intelligence\nquotient(IQ).Overtheyears,differenttypesofIQtestshaveevolved,butthewayscoresareinterpreted\nremains the same. The average IQ score on an IQ test is 100. Standard deviations describe how data are\ndispersed in a population and give context to large data sets. The bell curve uses the standard deviation\nto show how all scores are dispersed from the average score (Figure 7.15). In modern IQ testing, one\nstandard deviation is 15 points. So a score of 85 would be described as \u201cone standard deviation below\nthe mean.\u201d How would you describe a score of 115 and a score of 70? Any IQ score that falls within one\nstandarddeviationaboveandbelowthemean(between85and115)isconsideredaverage,and68%ofthe\npopulation has IQ scores in this range. An IQ score of 130 or above is considered a superior level.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence 241\nFigure 7.15 The majority of people have an IQ score between 85 and 115.\nOnly2.2%ofthepopulationhasanIQscorebelow70(AmericanPsychologicalAssociation[APA],2013).\nA score of 70 or below indicates significant cognitive delays, major deficits in adaptive functioning,\nand difficulty meeting \u201ccommunity standards of personal independence and social responsibility\u201d when\ncompared to same-aged peers (APA, 2013, p. 37). An individual in this IQ range would be considered\nto have an intellectual disability and exhibit deficits in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior\n(American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2013). Formerly known as mental\nretardation, the accepted term now is intellectual disability, and it has four subtypes: mild, moderate,\nsevere,andprofound(Table7.5).TheDiagnosticandStatisticalManualofPsychologicalDisorderslistscriteria\nfor each subgroup (APA, 2013).\nTable 7.5Characteristics of Cognitive Disorders\nIntellectual Percentage of\nDisability Intellectually Disabled Description\nSubtype Population\nMild 85% 3rd- to 6th-grade skill level in reading, writing, and\nmath; may be employed and live independently\nModerate 10% Basic reading and writing skills; functional self-care\nskills; requires some oversight\nSevere 5% Functional self-care skills; requires oversight of\ndaily environment and activities\nProfound <1% May be able to communicate verbally or\nnonverbally; requires intensive oversight\nOn the other end of the intelligence spectrum are those individuals whose IQs fall into the highest\nranges. Consistent with the bell curve, about 2% of the population falls into this category. People are\nconsidered gifted if they have an IQ score of 130 or higher, or superior intelligence in a particular\narea. Long ago, popular belief suggested that people of high intelligence were maladjusted. This idea\nwas disproven through a groundbreaking study of gifted children. In 1921, Lewis Terman began a\nlongitudinal study of over 1500 children with IQs over 135 (Terman, 1925). His findings showed that 242 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nthesechildrenbecamewell-educated,successfuladultswhowere,infact,well-adjusted(Terman&Oden,\n1947). Additionally, Terman\u2019s study showed that the subjects were above average in physical build and\nattractiveness,dispellinganearlierpopularnotionthathighlyintelligentpeoplewere\u201cweaklings.\u201dSome\npeoplewithveryhighIQselecttojoinMensa,anorganizationdedicatedtoidentifying,researching,and\nfostering intelligence. Members must have an IQ score in the top 2% of the population, and they may be\nrequired to pass other exams in their application to join the group.\nDIG DEEPER\nWhat\u2019s in a Name? Mental Retardation\nIn the past, individuals with IQ scores below 70 and significant adaptive and social functioning delays were\ndiagnosed with mental retardation. When this diagnosis was first named, the title held no social stigma.

Why or why not?\nWHY MEASURE INTELLIGENCE?\nThe value of IQ testing is most evident in educational or clinical settings. Children who seem to be\nexperiencing learning difficulties or severe behavioral problems can be tested to ascertain whether the\nchild\u2019s difficulties can be partly attributed to an IQ score that is significantly different from the mean for\nheragegroup.WithoutIQtesting\u2014oranothermeasureofintelligence\u2014childrenandadultsneedingextra\nsupportmightnotbeidentifiedeffectively.Inaddition,IQtestingisusedincourtstodeterminewhethera\ndefendanthasspecialorextenuatingcircumstancesthatprecludehimfromparticipatinginsomewayina\ntrial.PeoplealsouseIQtestingresultstoseekdisabilitybenefitsfromtheSocialSecurityAdministration.\nWhile IQ tests have sometimes been used as arguments in support of insidious purposes, such as the\neugenicsmovement(Severson,2011),thefollowingcasestudydemonstratestheusefulnessandbenefitsof\nIQ testing.\nCandace, a 14-year-old girl experiencing problems at school, was referred for a court-ordered\npsychologicalevaluation.Shewasinregulareducationclassesinninthgradeandwasfailingeverysubject.\nCandace had never been a stellar student but had always been passed to the next grade.

Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited\nfrom a person\u2019s parents. Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the\nheritability of intelligence. The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well-known\ntwin studies. In this investigation, researchers found that identical twins raised together and identical\ntwins raised apart exhibit a higher correlation between their IQ scores than siblings or fraternal twins\nraisedtogether(Bouchard,Lykken,McGue,Segal,&Tellegen,1990).Thefindingsfromthisstudyreveal\na genetic component to intelligence (Figure 7.16). At the same time, other psychologists believe that\nintelligence is shaped by a child\u2019s developmental environment. If parents were to provide their children\nwithintellectualstimuli from beforetheyareborn,itislikelythattheywould absorb thebenefitsofthat\nstimulation, and it would be reflected in intelligence levels. 244 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nFigure 7.16 Thecorrelationsof IQs of unrelated versus related persons reared apart or together suggest a genetic\ncomponent to intelligence.\nThe reality is that aspects of each idea are probably correct. In fact, one study suggests that although\ngenetics seem to be in control of the level of intelligence, the environmental influences provide both\nstabilityandchangetotriggermanifestationofcognitiveabilities(Bartels,Rietveld,VanBaal,&Boomsma,\n2002). Certainly, there are behaviors that support the development of intelligence, but the genetic\ncomponentofhighintelligenceshouldnotbeignored.Aswithallheritabletraits,however,itisnotalways\npossible to isolate how and when high intelligence is passed on to the next generation.\nRange of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based\non his or her genetic makeup. According to this idea, your genetic potential is a fixed quantity, but\nwhether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you\nexperience, especially in childhood. Think about this scenario: A couple adopts a child who has average\ngenetic intellectual potential. They raise her in an extremely stimulating environment. What will happen\nto the couple\u2019s new daughter? It is likely that the stimulating environment will improve her intellectual\noutcomes over the course of her life. But what happens if this experiment is reversed? If a child with\nan extremely strong genetic background is placed in an environment that does not stimulate him: What\nhappens? Interestingly, according to a longitudinal study of highly gifted individuals, it was found that\n\u201cthetwoextremesofoptimalandpathologicalexperiencearebothrepresenteddisproportionatelyinthe\nbackgrounds of creative individuals\u201d; however, those who experienced supportive family environments\nwere more likely to report being happy (Csikszentmihalyi & Csikszentmihalyi, 1993, p. 187).\nAnother challenge to determining origins of high intelligence is the confounding nature of our human\nsocialstructures.ItistroublingtonotethatsomeethnicgroupsperformbetteronIQteststhanothers\u2014and\nit is likely that the results do not have much to do with the quality of each ethnic group\u2019s intellect.\nThe same is true for socioeconomic status. Children who live in poverty experience more pervasive,\ndaily stress than children who do not worry about the basic needs of safety, shelter, and food. These\nworries can negatively affect how the brain functions and develops, causing a dip in IQ scores. Mark\nKishiyamaandhiscolleaguesdeterminedthatchildrenlivinginpovertydemonstratedreducedprefrontal\nbrain functioning comparable to children with damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex (Kishyama, Boyce,\nJimenez, Perry, & Knight, 2009).\nThedebatearoundthefoundationsandinfluencesonintelligenceexplodedin1969,whenaneducational\npsychologistnamedArthurJensenpublishedthearticle\u201cHowMuchCanWeBoostI.Q.andAchievement\u201d\nin the Harvard Educational Review. Jensen had administered IQ tests to diverse groups of students, and\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence 245\nhis results led him to the conclusion that IQ is determined by genetics. He also posited that intelligence\nwas made up of two types of abilities: Level I and Level II. In his theory, Level I is responsible for rote\nmemorization, whereas Level II is responsible for conceptual and analytical abilities. According to his\nfindings, Level I remained consistent among the human race. Level II, however, exhibited differences\namong ethnic groups (Modgil & Routledge, 1987). Jensen\u2019s most controversial conclusion was that Level\nIIintelligenceisprevalentamongAsians,thenCaucasians,thenAfricanAmericans.RobertWilliamswas\namong those who called out racial bias in Jensen\u2019s results (Williams, 1970).\nObviously,Jensen\u2019sinterpretationofhisowndatacausedanintenseresponseinanationthatcontinuedto\ngrapplewiththeeffectsofracism(Fox,2012).However,Jensen\u2019sideaswerenotsolitaryorunique;rather,\nthey represented one of many examples of psychologists asserting racial differences in IQ and cognitive\nability. In fact, Rushton and Jensen (2005) reviewed three decades worth of research on the relationship\nbetween race and cognitive ability. Jensen\u2019s belief in the inherited nature of intelligence and the validity\nof the IQ test to be the truest measure of intelligence are at the core of his conclusions.

It should be pointed out that learning disabilities are not the same thing as intellectual\ndisabilities. Learning disabilities are considered specific neurological impairments rather than global\nintellectualordevelopmentaldisabilities.Apersonwithalanguagedisabilityhasdifficultyunderstanding\nor using spoken language, whereas someone with a reading disability, such as dyslexia, has difficulty\nprocessing what he or she is reading.\nOften, learning disabilities are not recognized until a child reaches school age. One confounding aspect\nof learning disabilities is that they often affect children with average to above-average intelligence. At\nthe same time, learning disabilities tend to exhibit comorbidity with other disorders, like attention-\ndeficithyperactivitydisorder(ADHD).Anywherebetween30\u201370%ofindividualswithdiagnosedcasesof\nADHDalsohavesomesortoflearningdisability(Riccio,Gonzales,&Hynd,1994).Let\u2019stakealookattwo\nexamples of common learning disabilities: dysgraphia and dyslexia. 246 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nDysgraphia\nChildrenwithdysgraphiahavealearningdisabilitythatresultsinastruggletowritelegibly.Thephysical\ntask of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person.

Still others focus on the importance of emotional\nintelligence. Finally, creativity seems to be a facet of intelligence, but it is extremely difficult to measure\nobjectively.\n7.5Measures of Intelligence\nIn this section, we learned about the history of intelligence testing and some of the challenges regarding\nintelligence testing. Intelligence tests began in earnest with Binet; Wechsler later developed intelligence\ntests that are still in use today: the WAIS-IV and WISC-V. The Bell curve shows the range of scores that\nencompass average intelligence as well as standard deviations.\n7.6The Source of Intelligence\nGenetics and environment affect intelligence and the challenges of certain learning disabilities. The\nintelligence levels of all individuals seem to benefit from rich stimulation in their early environments.\nHighly intelligent individuals, however, may have a built-in resiliency that allows them to overcome\ndifficult obstacles in their upbringing. Learning disabilities can cause major challenges for children who\nare learning to read and write. Unlike developmental disabilities, learning disabilities are strictly\nneurological in nature and are not related to intelligence levels. Students with dyslexia, for example,\nmay have extreme difficulty learning to read, but their intelligence levels are typically average or above\naverage. 250 Chapter 7 | Thinking and Intelligence\nReview Questions\n1.

Once you know how to drive, you\ncan encode additional information about this skill automatically. (credit: Robert Couse-Baker)\nWhat are the most effective ways to ensure that important memories are well encoded? Even a simple\nsentence is easier to recall when it is meaningful (Anderson, 1984). Read the following sentences\n(Bransford &McCarrell,1974),thenlookawayandcountbackwards from30bythreestozero,andthen\ntry to write down the sentences (no peeking back at this page!).\n1. The notes were sour because the seams split.\n2. The voyage wasn't delayed because the bottle shattered.\n3. The haystack was important because the cloth ripped.\nHow well did you do? By themselves, the statements that you wrote down were most likely confusing\nand difficult for you to recall. Now, try writing them again, using the following prompts: bagpipe, ship\nchristening, and parachutist. Next count backwards from 40 by fours, then check yourself to see how\nwellyourecalledthesentencesthistime.Youcanseethatthesentencesarenowmuchmorememorable\nbecause each of the sentences was placed in context. Material is far better encoded when you make it\nmeaningful.\nThere are three types of encoding. The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic\nencoding. It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked\npeople to memorize words. The 60 words were actually divided into 4 categories of meaning, although\nthe participants did not know this because the words were randomly presented. When they were asked\nto remember thewords, theytended to recall them incategories, showing thattheypaid attention to the\nmeanings of the words as they learned them.\nVisual encoding is the encoding of images, and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds, words in\nparticular.Toseehowvisualencodingworks,readoverthislistofwords:car,level,dog,truth,book,value.\nIf you were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you\u2019d most likely\nremember? You would probably have an easier time recalling the words car, dog, and book, and a more\ndifficulttimerecallingthewordslevel,truth,andvalue.Whyisthis?Becauseyoucanrecallimages(mental\npictures) more easily than words alone. When you read the words car, dog, and book you created images\nofthesethingsinyourmind.Theseareconcrete,high-imagerywords.Ontheotherhand,abstractwords\nlike level, truth, and value are low-imagery words. High-imagery words are encoded both visually and\nsemantically (Paivio, 1986), thus building a stronger memory.\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to acoustic encoding. You are driving in your car and a song comes on the\nradio that you haven\u2019t heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word. In the United\nStates, children often learnthealphabetthrough song, andtheylearnthenumber ofdays ineachmonth\nthrough rhyme: \u201cThirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-\none,/SaveFebruary,withtwenty-eightdaysclear,/Andtwenty-nineeachleapyear.\u201dTheselessonsare 256 Chapter 8 | Memory\neasytorememberbecauseofacousticencoding.Weencodethesoundsthewordsmake.Thisisoneofthe\nreasons why much of what we teach young children is done through song, rhyme, and rhythm.\nWhichofthethreetypesofencodingdoyouthinkwouldgiveyouthebestmemoryofverbalinformation?\nSome years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments\nto find out. Participants were given words along with questions about them. The questions required the\nparticipantstoprocessthewordsatoneofthethreelevels.Thevisualprocessingquestionsincludedsuch\nthings as asking the participants about the font of the letters. The acoustic processing questions asked\nthe participants about the sound or rhyming of the words, and the semantic processing questions asked\nthe participants about the meaning of the words. After participants were presented with the words and\nquestions, they were given an unexpected recall or recognition task.\nWords that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually or\nacoustically.Semanticencodinginvolvesadeeperlevelofprocessingthantheshallowervisualoracoustic\nencoding. Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic\nencoding, especially if we apply what is called the self-reference effect. The self-reference effect is the\ntendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison\ntomaterialthathaslesspersonalrelevance(Rogers,Kuiper&Kirker,1977).Couldsemanticencodingbe\nbeneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter?\nSTORAGE\nOnce the information has been encoded, we have to somehow have to retain it. Our brains take the\nencoded information and place it in storage.Storageis the creation of a permanent record of information.\nIn order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct\nstages: Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first\nproposedbyRichardAtkinsonandRichardShiffrin(1968).Theirmodelofhumanmemory(Figure 8.4),\ncalled Atkinson-Shiffrin (A-S), is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a\ncomputer processes information.\nFigure 8.4 According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stages in\norder for it to be stored in long-term memory.\nBut A-S is just one model of memory. Others, such as Baddeley and Hitch (1974), have proposed a\nmodelwhereshort-termmemoryitselfhasdifferentforms.Inthismodel,storingmemoriesinshort-term\nmemory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information. The type of short-term\nmemory (or computer file) depends on the type of information received. There are memories in visual-\nspatial form, as well as memories of spoken or written material, and they are stored in three short-term\nsystems:avisuospatialsketchpad,anepisodicbuffer,andaphonologicalloop.AccordingtoBaddeleyand\nHitch, acentral executive part of memory supervises or controls the flow of information to and from the\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 8 | Memory 257\nthree short-term systems.\nSensory Memory\nIn the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory:\nstorageofbriefsensoryevents,suchassights,sounds,andtastes.Itisverybriefstorage\u2014uptoacouple\nof seconds.

George Miller (1956), in his research on the capacity of memory, found that most\npeoplecanretainabout7itemsinSTM.Someremember5,some9,sohecalledthecapacityofSTM7plus\nor minus 2.\nThink of short-term memory as the information you have displayed on your computer screen\u2014a\ndocument, a spreadsheet, or a web page.

Unlike short-term memory, the\nstorage capacity of LTM has no limits. It encompasses all the things you can remember that happened\nmorethanjustafewminutesagotoallofthethingsthatyoucanrememberthathappeneddays,weeks,\nand years ago. In keeping with the computer analogy, the information in your LTM would be like the\ninformation you have saved on the hard drive. It isn\u2019t there on your desktop (your short-term memory),\nbut you can pull up this information when you want it, at least most of the time. Not all long-term\nmemoriesarestrongmemories.Somememoriescanonlyberecalledthroughprompts.Forexample,you\nmighteasilyrecallafact\u2014\u201cWhatisthecapitaloftheUnitedStates?\u201d\u2014oraprocedure\u2014\u201cHowdoyouride\nabike?\u201d\u2014butyoumightstruggletorecallthenameoftherestaurantyouhaddinnerwhenyouwereon\nvacation in France last summer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was named after its owner, who\nspoke to you about your shared interest in soccer, may help you recall the name of the restaurant.\nLong-term memory is divided into two types: explicit and implicit (Figure 8.7). Understanding the\ndifferent types is important because a person\u2019s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can\nleavecertaintypesofLTMintactwhilehavingdisastrousconsequencesforothertypes.Explicitmemories\narethoseweconsciouslytrytorememberandrecall.Forexample,ifyouarestudyingforyourchemistry\nexam, the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory.

Implicit memory is also called non-declarative memory.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 8 | Memory 259\nFigure 8.7 There are two components of long-term memory: explicit and implicit. Explicit memory includes episodic\nand semantic memory. Implicit memory includes procedural memory and things learned through conditioning.\nProcedural memory is a type of implicit memory: it stores information about how to do things. It is the\nmemory for skilled actions, such as how to brush your teeth, how to drive a car, how to swim the crawl\n(freestyle) stroke. If you are learning how to swim freestyle, you practice the stroke: how to move your\narms,howtoturnyourheadtoalternatebreathingfromsidetoside,andhowtokickyourlegs.Youwould\npracticethismanytimesuntilyoubecomegoodatit.Onceyoulearnhowtoswimfreestyleandyourbody\nknows how to move through the water, you will never forget how to swim freestyle, even if you do not\nswimforacoupleofdecades.Similarly,ifyoupresentanaccomplishedguitaristwithaguitar,evenifhe\nhas not played in a long time, he will still be able to play quite well.\nDeclarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced. Explicit\n(declarative) memory has two parts: semantic memory and episodic memory. Semantic means having\nto do with language and knowledge about language. An example would be the question \u201cwhat does\nargumentativemean?\u201dStoredinoursemanticmemoryisknowledgeaboutwords,concepts,andlanguage-\nbasedknowledgeandfacts.Forexample,answerstothefollowingquestionsarestoredinyoursemantic\nmemory:\n\u2022 Who was the first President of the United States?\n\u2022 What is democracy?\n\u2022 What is the longest river in the world?\nEpisodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced. The concept of episodic\nmemorywasfirstproposedabout40yearsago(Tulving,1972).Sincethen,Tulvingandothershavelooked\nat scientific evidence and reformulated the theory. Currently, scientists believe that episodic memory is\nmemoryabouthappeningsinparticularplacesatparticulartimes,thewhat,where,andwhenofanevent\n(Tulving,2002).Itinvolvesrecollectionofvisualimageryaswellasthefeelingoffamiliarity(Hassabis&\nMaguire, 2007). 260 Chapter 8 | Memory\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\nCan You Remember Everything You Ever Did or Said?\nEpisodic memories are also called autobiographical memories.

How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it? The\nactofgettinginformationoutofmemorystorageandbackintoconsciousawarenessisknownasretrieval.\nThiswouldbesimilartofindingandopeningapaperyouhadpreviouslysavedonyourcomputer\u2019shard\ndrive.Nowit\u2019sbackonyourdesktop,andyoucanworkwithitagain.Ourabilitytoretrieveinformation\nfrom long-term memory is vital to our everyday functioning. You must be able to retrieve information\nfrom memory in order to do everything from knowing how to brush your hair and teeth, to driving to\nwork, to knowing how to perform your job once you get there.\nThere are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long-term memory storage system: recall,\nrecognition, and relearning. Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory\nretrieval: it means you can access information without cues. For example, you would use recall for an\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 8 | Memory 261\nessay test.

Based on his creation of lesions and the animals\u2019\nreaction, he formulated the equipotentiality hypothesis: if part of one area of the brain involved in\nmemory is damaged, another part of the same area can take over that memory function (Lashley, 1950).\nAlthough Lashley\u2019s early work did not confirm the existence of the engram, modern psychologists are\nmaking progress locating it. Eric Kandel, for example, spent decades working on the synapse, the basic\nstructureofthebrain,anditsroleincontrollingtheflowofinformationthroughneuralcircuitsneededto\nstore memories (Mayford, Siegelbaum, & Kandel, 2012).\nManyscientistsbelievethattheentirebrainisinvolvedwithmemory.However,sinceLashley\u2019sresearch,\nother scientists have been able to look more closely at the brain and memory. They have argued that\nmemory is located in specific parts of the brain, and specific neurons can be recognized for their\ninvolvementinformingmemories.Themainpartsofthebraininvolvedwithmemoryaretheamygdala,\nthe hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex (Figure 8.9). 262 Chapter 8 | Memory\nFigure 8.9 The amygdala is involved in fear and fear memories. The hippocampus is associated with declarative\nand episodic memory as well as recognition memory. The cerebellum plays a role in processing procedural\nmemories, such as how to play the piano. The prefrontal cortex appears to be involved in remembering semantic\ntasks.\nTHE AMYGDALA\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation. The main job of the amygdala is to\nregulateemotions,suchasfearandaggression(Figure 8.9).Theamygdalaplaysapartinhowmemories\nare stored because storage is influenced by stress hormones. For example, one researcher experimented\nwithratsandthefearresponse(Josselyn,2010).UsingPavlovianconditioning,aneutraltonewaspaired\nwithafootshocktotherats.Thisproducedafearmemoryintherats.Afterbeingconditioned,eachtime\ntheyheardthetone,theywouldfreeze(adefenseresponseinrats),indicatingamemoryfortheimpending\nshock.Thentheresearchersinducedcelldeathinneuronsinthelateralamygdala,whichisthespecificarea\nofthebrainresponsibleforfearmemories.Theyfoundthefearmemoryfaded(becameextinct).Becauseof\nitsroleinprocessingemotionalinformation,theamygdalaisalsoinvolvedinmemoryconsolidation:the\nprocess of transferring new learning into long-term memory.

When researchers damaged the\ncerebellums of rabbits, they discovered that the rabbits were not able to learn the conditioned eye-blink\nresponse (Steinmetz, 1999; Green & Woodruff-Pak, 2000).\nOther researchers have used brain scans, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans, to learn\nhowpeopleprocessandretaininformation.Fromthesestudies,itseemstheprefrontalcortexisinvolved.\nIn one study, participants had to complete two different tasks: either looking for the letter a in words\n(consideredaperceptualtask)orcategorizinganounaseitherlivingornon-living(consideredasemantic\ntask)(Kapuretal.,1994).Participantswerethenaskedwhichwordstheyhadpreviouslyseen.Recallwas\nmuch better for the semantic task than for the perceptual task.

There continues to be\ndiscussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role\n(Blockland,1996).Althoughwedon\u2019tyetknowwhichroleeachneurotransmitterplaysinmemory,wedo\nknowthatcommunicationamongneuronsvianeurotransmittersiscriticalfordevelopingnewmemories.\nRepeatedactivitybyneuronsleadstoincreasedneurotransmittersinthesynapsesandmoreefficientand\nmore synaptic connections.

Where\nwere you when you first heard about the 9/11 terrorist attacks? Most likely you can remember where\nyou were and what you were doing. In fact, a Pew Research Center (2011) survey found that for those\nAmericanswhowereage8orolderatthetimeoftheevent,97%canrecallthemomenttheylearnedofthis\nevent, even a decade after it happened.\nFigure 8.10 Most people can remember where they were when they first heard about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

There are several reasons why this happens.\nAMNESIA\nAmnesia is the loss of long-term memory that occurs as the result of disease, physical trauma, or\npsychologicaltrauma.PsychologistTulving(2002)andhiscolleaguesattheUniversityofTorontostudied\nK. C. for years. K. C. suffered a traumatic head injury in a motorcycle accident and then had severe\namnesia. Tulving writes,\ntheoutstandingfactaboutK.C.'smentalmake-upishisutterinabilitytorememberanyevents,\ncircumstances,orsituationsfromhisownlife.Hisepisodicamnesiacovershiswholelife,from\nbirthtothepresent.Theonlyexceptionistheexperiencesthat,atanytime,hehashadinthelast\nminute or two. (Tulving, 2002, p. 14)\nAnterograde Amnesia\nThere are two common types of amnesia: anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia (Figure 8.11).\nAnterogradeamnesiaiscommonlycausedbybraintrauma,suchasablowtothehead.Withanterograde\namnesia, you cannot remember new information, although you can remember information and events\nthat happened prior to your injury. The hippocampus is usually affected (McLeod, 2011). This suggests\nthatdamagetothebrainhasresultedintheinabilitytotransferinformationfromshort-termtolong-term\nmemory; that is, the inability to consolidate memories.\nMany people with this form of amnesia are unable to form new episodic or semantic memories, but are\nstill able to form new procedural memories (Bayley & Squire, 2002). This was true of H. M., which was\ndiscussedearlier.Thebraindamagecausedbyhissurgeryresultedinanterogradeamnesia.H.M.would\nreadthesamemagazineoverandover,havingnomemoryofeverreadingit\u2014itwasalwaysnewtohim.\nHe also could not remember people he had met after his surgery. If you were introduced to H. M. and\nthenyoulefttheroomforafewminutes,hewouldnotknowyouuponyourreturnandwouldintroduce\nhimself to you again. However, when presented the same puzzle several days in a row, although he did\nnot remember having seen the puzzle before, his speed at solving it became faster each day (because of\nrelearning) (Corkin, 1965, 1968). 266 Chapter 8 | Memory\nFigure 8.11 This diagram illustrates the timeline of retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Memory problems that\nextend back in time before the injury and prevent retrieval of information previously stored in long-term memory are\nknown as retrograde amnesia. Conversely, memory problems that extend forward in time from the point of injury and\nprevent the formation of new memories are called anterograde amnesia.\nRetrograde Amnesia\nRetrogradeamnesiaislossofmemoryforeventsthatoccurredpriortothetrauma.Peoplewithretrograde\namnesia cannot remember some or even all of their past. They have difficulty remembering episodic\nmemories. What if you woke up in the hospital one day and there were people surrounding your bed\nclaiming to be your spouse, your children, and your parents? The trouble is you don\u2019t recognize any of\nthem. You were in a car accident, suffered a head injury, and now have retrograde amnesia. You don\u2019t\nremember anything about your life prior to waking up in the hospital. This may sound like the stuff of\nHollywoodmovies,andHollywoodhasbeenfascinatedwiththeamnesiaplotfornearlyacentury,going\nall the way back to the film Garden of Lies from 1915 to more recent movies such as the Jason Bourne\nspythrillers.However,forreal-lifesufferersofretrogradeamnesia,likeformerNFLfootballplayerScott\nBolzan,thestoryisnotaHollywoodmovie.Bolzanfell,hithishead,anddeleted46yearsofhislifeinan\ninstant.

Yet as we retrieve our memories, we also tend to alter and modify\nthem. A memory pulled from long-term storage into short-term memory is flexible. New events can be\nadded and we can change what we think we remember about past events, resulting in inaccuracies and\ndistortions. People may not intend to distort facts, but it can happen in the process of retrieving old\nmemories and combining them with new memories (Roediger and DeSoto, in press).\nSuggestibility\nWhen someone witnesses a crime, that person\u2019s memory of the details of the crime is very important in\ncatchingthesuspect.Becausememoryissofragile,witnessescanbeeasily(andoftenaccidentally)misled\nduetotheproblemofsuggestibility.Suggestibilitydescribestheeffectsofmisinformationfromexternal\nsourcesthatleadstothecreationoffalsememories.Inthefallof2002,asniperintheDCareashotpeople\natagasstation,leavingHomeDepot,andwalkingdownthestreet.Theseattackswentoninavarietyof\nplacesforoverthreeweeksandresultedinthedeathsoftenpeople.Duringthistime,asyoucanimagine,\npeoplewereterrifiedtoleavetheirhomes,goshopping,orevenwalkthroughtheirneighborhoods.Police\nofficersandtheFBIworkedfranticallytosolvethecrimes,andatiphotlinewassetup.Lawenforcement\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 8 | Memory 267\nreceived over 140,000 tips, which resulted in approximately 35,000 possible suspects (Newseum, n.d.).\nMostofthetipsweredeadends,untilawhitevanwasspottedatthesiteofoneoftheshootings.Thepolice\nchiefwentonnationaltelevisionwithapictureofthewhitevan.Afterthenewsconference,severalother\neyewitnesses called to say that they too had seen a white van fleeing from the scene of the shooting.

The idea that memories of traumatic events could be repressed has been a theme\nin the field of psychology, beginning with Sigmund Freud, and the controversy surrounding the idea\ncontinues today.\nRecalloffalseautobiographicalmemoriesiscalledfalsememorysyndrome.Thissyndromehasreceived\na lot of publicity, particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent\nwitnesses\u2014often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim (e.g., sexual abuse).\nOn one side of the debate are those who have recovered memories of childhood abuse years after\nit occurred. These researchers argue that some children\u2019s experiences have been so traumatizing and\ndistressing that they must lock those memories away in order to lead some semblance of a normal life.\nThey believe that repressed memories can be locked away for decades and later recalled intact through\nhypnosis and guided imagery techniques (Devilly, 2007).\nResearch suggests that having no memory of childhood sexual abuse is quite common in adults. For\ninstance, one large-scale study conducted by John Briere and Jon Conte (1993) revealed that 59% of\n450 men and women who were receiving treatment for sexual abuse that had occurred before age 18\nhad forgotten their experiences. Ross Cheit (2007) suggested that repressing these memories created 270 Chapter 8 | Memory\npsychological distress in adulthood. The Recovered Memory Project was created so that victims of\nchildhood sexual abuse can recall these memories and allow the healing process to begin (Cheit, 2007;\nDevilly, 2007).\nOn the other side, Loftus has challenged the idea that individuals can repress memories of traumatic\nevents from childhood, including sexual abuse, and then recover those memories years later through\ntherapeutic techniques such as hypnosis, guided visualization, and age regression.\nLoftus is not saying that childhood sexual abuse doesn\u2019t happen, but she does question whether or\nnot those memories are accurate, and she is skeptical of the questioning process used to access these\nmemories, given that even the slightest suggestion from the therapist can lead to misinformation effects.\nFor example, researchers Stephen Ceci and Maggie Brucks (1993, 1995) asked three-year-old children to\nuse an anatomically correct doll to show where their pediatricians had touched them during an exam.\nFifty-five percent of the children pointed to the genital/anal area on the dolls, even when they had not\nreceived any form of genital exam.\nEver since Loftus published her first studies on the suggestibility of eyewitness testimony in the 1970s,\nsocialscientists,policeofficers,therapists,andlegalpractitionershavebeenawareoftheflawsininterview\npractices. Consequently, steps have been taken to decrease suggestibility of witnesses. One way is to\nmodifyhowwitnessesarequestioned.Wheninterviewersuseneutralandlessleadinglanguage,children\nmore accurately recall what happened and who was involved (Goodman, 2006; Pipe, 1996; Pipe, Lamb,\nOrbach, & Esplin, 2004). Another change is in how police lineups are conducted. It\u2019s recommended that\na blind photo lineup be used. This way the person administering the lineup doesn\u2019t know which photo\nbelongs to the suspect, minimizing the possibility of giving leading cues. Additionally, judges in some\nstates now inform jurors about the possibility of misidentification. Judges can also suppress eyewitness\ntestimony if they deem it unreliable.\nFORGETTING\n\u201cI\u2019ve a grand memory for forgetting,\u201d quipped Robert Louis Stevenson.

He calls them the seven sins of memory and categorizes them into three groups: forgetting,\ndistortion, and intrusion (Table 8.1).\nTable 8.1Schacter\u2019s Seven Sins of Memory\nSin Type Description Example\nTransience Forgetting Accessibility of memory Forget events that occurred\ndecreases over time long ago\nabsentmindedness Forgetting Forgetting caused by lapses in Forget where your phone is\nattention\nBlocking Forgetting Accessibility of information is Tip of the tongue\ntemporarily blocked\nMisattribution Distortion Source of memory is confused Recalling a dream memory as\na waking memory\nSuggestibility Distortion False memories Result from leading questions\nBias Distortion Memories distorted by current Align memories to current\nbelief system beliefs\nPersistence Intrusion Inability to forget undesirable Traumatic events\nmemories\nLet\u2019s look at the first sin of the forgetting errors: transience, which means that memories can fade over\ntime.Here\u2019sanexampleofhowthishappens.Nathan\u2019sEnglishteacherhasassignedhisstudentstoread\nthe novel To Kill a Mockingbird.

The memory is right there, but you\ncan\u2019t seem to recall it, just like not being able to remember the name of that very famous actor, Morgan Freeman.\n(credit: modification of work by D. Miller)\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the three errors of distortion: misattribution, suggestibility, and bias.\nMisattributionhappenswhenyouconfusethesourceofyourinformation.Let\u2019ssayAlejandrowasdating\nLucia and they saw the first Hobbit movie together.

Is it possible that the\nvictimcouldactuallyblametherapeonthepersonshesawontelevisionbecauseofmisattribution?This\nis exactly what happened to Donald Thomson.\nAustralian eyewitness expert Donald Thomson appeared on a live TV discussion about the\nunreliabilityofeyewitnessmemory.Hewaslaterarrested,placedinalineupandidentifiedby\na victim as the man who had raped her. The police charged Thomson although the rape had\noccurred at the time he was on TV. They dismissed his alibi that he was in plain view of a TV\naudience and in the company of the other discussants, including an assistant commissioner of\npolice....Eventually,theinvestigatorsdiscoveredthattherapisthadattackedthewomanasshe\nwaswatchingTV\u2014theveryprogramonwhichThomsonhadappeared.Authoritieseventually\nclearedThomson.Thewomanhadconfusedtherapist'sfacewiththefacethatshehadseenon\nTV. (Baddeley, 2004, p. 133)\nThe second distortion error is suggestibility. Suggestibility is similar to misattribution, since it also\ninvolves false memories, but it\u2019s different. With misattribution you create the false memory entirely on\nyourown,whichiswhatthevictimdidintheDonaldThomsoncaseabove.Withsuggestibility,itcomes\nfromsomeoneelse,suchasatherapistorpoliceintervieweraskingleadingquestionsofawitnessduring 274 Chapter 8 | Memory\nan interview.\nMemories can also be affected by bias, which is the final distortion error. Schacter (2001) says that your\nfeelingsandviewoftheworldcanactuallydistortyourmemoryofpastevents.Thereareseveraltypesof\nbias:\n\u2022 Stereotypical bias involves racial and gender biases. For example, when Asian American and\nEuropeanAmericanresearchparticipantswerepresentedwithalistofnames,theymorefrequently\nincorrectlyrememberedtypicalAfricanAmericannamessuchasJamalandTyronetobeassociated\nwith the occupation basketball player, and they more frequently incorrectly remembered typical\nWhite names such as Greg and Howard to be associated with the occupation of politician (Payne,\nJacoby, & Lambert, 2004).\n\u2022 Egocentric bias involves enhancing our memories of the past (Payne et al., 2004). Did you really\nscore the winning goal in that big soccer match, or did you just assist?\n\u2022 Hindsightbiashappenswhenwethinkanoutcomewasinevitableafterthefact.Thisisthe\u201cIknew\nitallalong\u201dphenomenon.Thereconstructivenatureofmemorycontributestohindsightbias(Carli,\n1999). We remember untrue events that seem to confirm that we knew the outcome all along.\nHave you ever had asong playover and over inyour head? How about amemory of atraumatic event,\nsomething you really do not want to think about? When you keep remembering something, to the point\nwhere you can\u2019t \u201cget it out of your head\u201d and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other\nthings, it is called persistence. It\u2019s Schacter\u2019s seventh and last memory error. It\u2019s actually a failure of our\nmemorysystembecauseweinvoluntarilyrecallunwantedmemories,particularlyunpleasantones(Figure\n8.17). For instance, you witness a horrific car accident on the way to work one morning, and you can\u2019t\nconcentrate on work because you keep remembering the scene.\nFigure 8.17 Many veterans of military conflicts involuntarily recall unwanted, unpleasant memories. (credit:\nDepartment of Defense photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Michael R. Holzworth)\nInterference\nSometimes information is stored in our memory, but for some reason it is inaccessible. This is known as\ninterference, and there are two types: proactive interference and retroactive interference (Figure 8.18).\nHave you ever gotten a new phone number or moved to a new address, but right after you tell people\nthe old (and wrong) phone number or address? When the new year starts, do you find you accidentally\nwrite the previous year? These are examples of proactive interference: when old information hinders\nthe recall of newly learned information. Retroactive interference happens when information learned\nmore recently hinders the recall of older information. For example, this week you are studying about\nFreud\u2019sPsychoanalyticTheory.NextweekyoustudythehumanisticperspectiveofMaslowandRogers.\nThereafter,youhavetroublerememberingFreud\u2019sPsychosexualStagesofDevelopmentbecauseyoucan\nonly remember Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 8 | Memory 275\nFigure 8.18 Sometimes forgetting is caused by a failure to retrieve information. This can be due to interference,\neither retroactive or proactive.\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Recognize and apply memory-enhancing strategies\n\u2022 Recognize and apply effective study techniques\nMostofussufferfrommemoryfailuresofonekindoranother,andmostofuswouldliketoimproveour\nmemories so that we don\u2019t forget where we put the car keys or, more importantly, the material we need\nto know for an exam. In this section, we\u2019ll look at some ways to help you remember better, and at some\nstrategies for more effective studying.\nMEMORY-ENHANCING STRATEGIES\nWhat are some everyday ways we can improve our memory, including recall? To help make sure\ninformation goes from short-term memory to long-term memory, you can use memory-enhancing\nstrategies.Onestrategyisrehearsal,ortheconsciousrepetitionofinformationtoberemembered(Craik&\nWatkins,1973).Thinkabouthowyoulearnedyourmultiplicationtablesasachild.Youmayrecallthat6x\n6 = 36, 6 x 7 = 42, and 6 x 8 = 48. Memorizing these facts is rehearsal.\nAnother strategy is chunking: you organize information into manageable bits or chunks (Bodie, Powers,\n& Fitch-Hauser, 2006). Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone\nnumbers.Insteadoftryingtoremember5205550467,yourememberthenumberas520-555-0467.So,ifyou\nmetaninterestingpersonatapartyandyouwantedtorememberhisphonenumber,youwouldnaturally\nchunk it, and you could repeat the number over and over, which is the rehearsal strategy. 276 Chapter 8 | Memory\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTry thisfun activity (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/memgame)that employs a\nmemory-enhancing strategy.\nYoucouldalsoenhancememorybyusingelaborativerehearsal:atechniqueinwhichyouthinkaboutthe\nmeaning of the new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory (Tigner,\n1999).Forexample,inthiscase,youcouldrememberthat520isanareacodeforArizonaandtheperson\nyou met is from Arizona. This would help you better remember the 520 prefix. If the information is\nretained, it goes into long-term memory.\nMnemonicdevicesarememoryaidsthathelpusorganizeinformationforencoding(Figure 8.19).They\nare especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps, stages, phases, and\npartsofasystem(Bellezza,1981).Brianneedstolearntheorderoftheplanetsinthesolarsystem,buthe\u2019s\nhavingahardtimerememberingthecorrectorder.HisfriendKellysuggestsamnemonicdevicethatcan\nhelp him remember.

Now, I might forget that name, but he was wearing\na Grateful Dead t-shirt. What\u2019s a band like the Grateful Dead? Phish. Where do fish live? The\nocean. What else lives in the ocean? Coral. Hello, Co-arl. (Wrubel & Spiller, 2010)\nIt seems the more vivid or unusual the mnemonic, the easier it is to remember. The key to using any\nmnemonic successfully is to find a strategy that works for you.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 8 | Memory 277\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this fascinatingTED Talks lecture (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/foer)titled\n\u201cFeats of Memory Anyone Can Do.\u201d The lecture is given by Joshua Foer, a science\nwriter who \u201caccidentally\u201d won the U. S. Memory Championships. He explains a\nmnemonic device called the memory palace.\nSome other strategies that are used to improve memory include expressive writing and saying words\naloud.Expressivewritinghelpsboostyourshort-termmemory,particularlyifyouwriteaboutatraumatic\nexperience in your life. Masao Yogo and Shuji Fujihara (2008) had participants write for 20-minute\nintervalsseveraltimespermonth.Theparticipantswereinstructedtowriteaboutatraumaticexperience,\ntheir best possible future selves, or a trivial topic. The researchers found that this simple writing task\nincreased short-term memory capacity after five weeks, but only for the participants who wrote about\ntraumatic experiences. Psychologists can\u2019t explain why this writing task works, but it does.\nWhat if you want to remember items you need to pick up at the store? Simply say them out loud to\nyourself. A series of studies (MacLeod, Gopie, Hourihan, Neary, & Ozubko, 2010) found that saying a\nword out loud improves your memory for the word because it increases the word\u2019s distinctiveness.

In other words, make use of the self-reference effect. Write notes in your own words.\nWrite definitions from the text, and then rewrite them in your own words.

Even if you think you know the material, study it again right before test time to increase\nthelikelihoodtheinformationwillremaininyourmemory.Overlearningcanhelppreventstorage\ndecay.\n\u2022 Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse: Review the material over time, in spaced and organized study\nsessions. Organize and study your notes, and take practice quizzes/exams. Link the new\ninformation to other information you already know well.\n\u2022 Be aware of interference: To reduce the likelihood of interference, study during a quiet time\nwithout interruptions or distractions (like television or music).\n\u2022 Keep moving: Of course you already know that exercise is good for your body, but did you also\nknow it\u2019s also good for your mind?

During sleep the brain\norganizes and consolidates information to be stored in long-term memory (Abel & B\u00e4uml, 2013).\n\u2022 Make use of mnemonic devices: As you learned earlier in this chapter, mnemonic devices often\nhelp us to remember and recall information. There are different types of mnemonic devices, such\nastheacronym.Anacronymisawordformedbythefirstletterofeachofthewordsyouwantto\nremember.

memory error in which unused memories fade with the passage of time\nvisual encoding input of images\nSummary\n8.1How Memory Functions\nMemory is a system or process that stores what we learn for future use.\nOur memory has three basic functions: encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Encoding is the\nact of getting information into our memory system through automatic or effortful processing. Storage is\nretentionoftheinformation,andretrievalistheactofgettinginformationoutofstorageandintoconscious\nawareness through recall, recognition, and relearning. The idea that information is processed through\nthreememorysystemsiscalledtheAtkinson-Shiffrin(A-S)modelofmemory.First,environmentalstimuli\nenteroursensorymemoryforaperiodoflessthanasecondtoafewseconds.Thosestimulithatwenotice\nandpayattentiontothenmoveintoshort-termmemory(alsocalledworkingmemory).Accordingtothe\nA-Smodel,ifwerehearsethisinformation,thenitmovesintolong-termmemoryforpermanentstorage.\nOther models like that of Baddeley and Hitch suggest there is more of a feedback loop between short-\ntermmemoryandlong-termmemory.Long-termmemoryhasapracticallylimitlessstoragecapacityand\nisdividedintoimplicitandexplicitmemory.Finally,retrievalistheactofgettingmemoriesoutofstorage\nand back into conscious awareness. This is done through recall, recognition, and relearning.\n8.2Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory\nBeginning with Karl Lashley, researchers and psychologists have been searching for the engram, which\nis the physical trace of memory. Lashley did not find the engram, but he did suggest that memories\nare distributed throughout the entire brain rather than stored in one specific area. Now we know that\nthree brain areas do play significant roles in the processing and storage of different types of memories:\ncerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala. The cerebellum\u2019s job is to process procedural memories; the\nhippocampus is where new memories are encoded; the amygdala helps determine what memories to\nstore, and it plays a part in determining where the memories are stored based on whether we have a\nstrong or weak emotional response to the event. Strong emotional experiences can trigger the release\nof neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthen memory, so that memory for an emotional\neventisusuallystrongerthanmemoryforanon-emotionalevent.Thisisshownbywhatisknownasthe\nflashbulbmemoryphenomenon:ourabilitytoremembersignificantlifeevents.However,ourmemoryfor\nlife events (autobiographical memory) is not always accurate.\n8.3Problems with Memory\nAllofusattimeshavefeltdismayed,frustrated,andevenembarrassedwhenourmemorieshavefailedus.\nOurmemoryisflexibleandpronetomanyerrors,whichiswhyeyewitnesstestimonyhasbeenfoundto\nbelargelyunreliable.Thereareseveralreasonswhyforgettingoccurs.Incasesofbraintraumaordisease,\nforgettingmaybeduetoamnesia.Anotherreasonweforgetisduetoencodingfailure.Wecan\u2019tremember\nsomething if we never stored it in our memory in the first place. Schacter presents seven memory errors\nthatalsocontributetoforgetting.Sometimes,informationisactuallystoredinourmemory,butwecannot\naccess it due to interference. Proactive interference happens when old information hinders the recall of\nnewly learned information. Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently\nhinders the recall of older information.\n8.4Ways to Enhance Memory\nThere are many ways to combat the inevitable failures of our memory system. Some common strategies\nthat can be used in everyday situations include mnemonic devices, rehearsal, self-referencing, and\nadequate sleep. These same strategies also can help you to study more effectively. 282 Chapter 8 | Memory\nReview Questions\n1. ________ is another name for short-term 8.

(Wordsworth, 1802)\nIn this poem, William Wordsworth writes, \u201cthe child is father of the man.\u201d What does this seemingly\nincongruousstatementmean,andwhatdoesithavetodowithlifespandevelopment?Wordsworthmight\nbe suggesting that the person he is as an adult depends largely on the experiences he had in childhood.\nConsider the following questions: To what extent is the adult you are today influenced by the child you\nonce were? To what extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?\nThese are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans\nchange and grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. They view\ndevelopment as a lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental\ndomains\u2014physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Physical development involves growth\nand changes in the body and brain, the senses, motor skills, and health and wellness. Cognitive\ndevelopment involves learning, attention, memory, language, thinking, reasoning, and creativity.\nPsychosocial development involves emotions, personality, and social relationships. We refer to these\ndomains throughout the chapter.\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\nResearch Methods in Developmental Psychology\nYou\u2019ve learned about a variety of research methods used by psychologists. Developmental psychologists use\nmany of these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over\ntime. These methods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others.\nNaturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context.

Freud\u2019s findings helped inform\nhistheoriesofpsychosexualdevelopmentinchildren,whichyouwilllearnaboutlaterinthischapter.LittleGenie,\nthe subject of a case study discussed in the chapter on thinking and intelligence, provides another example\nof how psychologists examine developmental milestones through detailed research on a single individual. In\nGenie\u2019s case, her neglectful and abusive upbringing led to her being unable to speak until, at age 13, she was\nremoved from that harmful environment. As she learned to use language, psychologists were able to compare\nhow her language acquisition abilities differed when occurring in her late-stage development compared to the\ntypical acquisition of those skills during the ages of infancy through early childhood (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss,\nRigler, & Rigler, 1974; Curtiss, 1981).\nThe survey method asks individuals to self-report important information about their thoughts, experiences, and\nbeliefs. This particular method can provide large amounts of information in relatively short amounts of time;\nhowever, validity of data collected in this way relies on honest self-reporting, and the data is relatively shallow\nwhen compared to the depth of information collected in a case study.\nExperimentsinvolvesignificantcontroloverextraneousvariablesandmanipulationoftheindependentvariable.\nAs such, experimental research allows developmental psychologists to make causal statements about certain\nvariables that are important for the developmental process. Because experimental research must occur in\na controlled environment, researchers must be cautious about whether behaviors observed in the laboratory\ntranslate to an individual\u2019s natural environment.\nLater in this chapter, you will learn about several experiments in which toddlers and young children observe\nscenes or actions so that researchers can determine at what age specific cognitive abilities develop. For\nexample,childrenmayobserveaquantityofliquidpouredfromashort,fatglassintoatall,skinnyglass.Asthe\nexperimenters question the children about what occurred, the subjects\u2019 answers help psychologists understand\nat what age a child begins to comprehend that the volume of liquid remained the same although the shapes of\nthe containers differs.\nAcross these three domains\u2014physical, cognitive, and psychosocial\u2014the normative approach to\ndevelopmentisalsodiscussed.Thisapproachasks,\u201cWhatisnormaldevelopment?\u201dIntheearlydecadesof\nthe20thcentury,normativepsychologistsstudiedlargenumbersofchildrenatvariousagestodetermine\nnorms (i.e., average ages) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the\nthree domains (Gesell, 1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904). Although children develop at\nslightly different rates, we can use these age-related averages as general guidelines to compare children\nwith same-age peers to determine the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events\ncalled developmental milestones (e.g., crawling, walking, writing, dressing, naming colors, speaking in\nsentences, and starting puberty).\nNot all normative events are universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all\ncultures.Biologicalmilestones,suchaspuberty,tendtobeuniversal,butsocialmilestones,suchastheage\nwhenchildrenbeginformalschooling,arenotnecessarilyuniversal;instead,theyaffectmostindividuals\nin a particular culture (Gesell & Ilg, 1946). For example, in developed countries children begin school\naround 5 or 6 years old, but in developing countries, like Nigeria, children often enter school at an\nadvanced age, if at all (Huebler, 2005; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization\n[UNESCO], 2013).\nTobetterunderstandthenormativeapproach,imaginetwonewmothers,LouisaandKimberly,whoare\nclosefriendsandhavechildrenaroundthesameage.Louisa\u2019sdaughteris14monthsold,andKimberly\u2019s\nson is 12 months old.

While the researchers acknowledge that programs aimed at\nreducing such socioeconomic discrepancies would likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of\nchildren from different backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would be difficult to\nachieve.

For Freud,\nchildhood experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults. Freud viewed development as\ndiscontinuous; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood, and\nthatifwelackpropernurturanceandparentingduringastage,wemaybecomestuck,orfixated,inthat\nstage. Freud\u2019s stages are called the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children\u2019s\npleasure-seekingurgesarefocusedonadifferentareaofthebody,calledanerogenouszone,ateachofthe\nfive stages of development: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.\nWhile most of Freud\u2019s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the\ncontributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud's\npsychosexualstagesasalegitimateexplanationforhowone'spersonalitydevelops,butwhatwecantake\nawayfromFreud\u2019stheoryisthatpersonalityisshaped,insomepart,byexperienceswehaveinchildhood.\nThese stages are discussed in detail in the chapter on personality.\nPSYCHOSOCIAL THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT\nErik Erikson (1902\u20131994) (Figure 9.4), another stage theorist, took Freud\u2019s theory and modified it as\npsychosocial theory. Erikson\u2019s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our\ndevelopment rather than its sexual nature. While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in\nchildhood, Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan. Erikson\nsuggested that how we interact with others is what affects our sense of self, or what he called the ego\nidentity.\nFigure 9.4 Erik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development. In each stage of Erikson\u2019s theory, there is\na psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel a sense of competence.\nErikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas of our lives.\nAccording to psychosocial theory, we experience eight stages of development over our lifespan, from\ninfancythroughlateadulthood.Ateachstagethereisaconflict,ortask,thatweneedtoresolve.Successful\ncompletionofeachdevelopmentaltaskresultsinasenseofcompetenceandahealthypersonality.Failure\nto master these tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.\nAccording to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months).\nTherefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus mistrust. Infants are dependent upon their\ncaregivers,socaregiverswhoareresponsiveandsensitivetotheirinfant\u2019sneedshelptheirbabytodevelop\nasenseoftrust;theirbabywillseetheworldasasafe,predictableplace.Unresponsivecaregiverswhodo\nnot meet their baby\u2019s needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the\nworld as unpredictable.\nAs toddlers (ages 1\u20133 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can control their actions\nandactontheenvironmenttogetresults.Theybegintoshowclearpreferencesforcertainelementsofthe 292 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\nenvironment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler\u2019s main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy\nversusshameanddoubt,byworkingtoestablishindependence.Thisisthe\u201cmedoit\u201dstage.Forexample,\nwe might observe a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes\nanddressherself.Althoughheroutfitsmightnotbeappropriateforthesituation,herinputinsuchbasic\ndecisionshasaneffectonhersenseofindependence.Ifdeniedtheopportunitytoactonherenvironment,\nshe may begin to doubt her abilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.\nOnce children reach the preschool stage (ages 3\u20136 years), they are capable of initiating activities and\nasserting control over their world through social interactions and play. According to Erikson, preschool\nchildren must resolve the task of initiative versus guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while\ninteractingwithothers,preschoolchildrencanmasterthistask.Thosewhodowilldevelopself-confidence\nand feel a sense of purpose. Those who are unsuccessful at this stage\u2014with their initiative misfiring or\nstifled\u2014may develop feelings of guilt. How might over-controlling parents stifle a child\u2019s initiative?\nDuring the elementary school stage (ages 6\u201312), children face the task of industry versus inferiority.\nChildren begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up.

The social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves\nfinding your life\u2019s work and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as\nvolunteering, mentoring, and raising children. Those who do not master this task may experience\nstagnation, having little connection with others and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.\nFrom the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood.\nErikson\u2019staskatthisstageiscalledintegrityversusdespair.Hesaidthatpeopleinlateadulthoodreflect\non their lives and feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure.

His theory of cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific\nstages,whichexemplifiesthediscontinuityapproachtodevelopment.Asweprogresstoanewstage,there\nis a distinct shift in how we think and reason. 294 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\nFigure 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.\nPiaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts\n(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children\nhave reached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new\ninformation, they adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First,\nthey assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when\ntheytakeininformationthatiscomparabletowhattheyalreadyknow.Accommodationdescribeswhen\nthey change their schemata based on new information. This process continues as children interact with\ntheir environment.\nFor example, 2-year-old Blake learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever.\nWhenBlakeseesotherdogsinhispicturebooks,hesays,\u201cLookmommy,dog!\u201dThus,hehasassimilated\nthem into his schema for dogs. One day, Blake sees a sheep for the first time and says, \u201cLook mommy,\ndog!\u201d Having a basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Blake thinks all furry, four-\nleggedcreaturesaredogs.WhenBlake\u2019smomtellshimthattheanimalheseesisasheep,notadog,Blake\nmustaccommodatehisschemafordogstoincludemoreinformationbasedonhisnewexperiences.Blake\u2019s\nschema for dog was too broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his\nschema for dogs and forms a new one for sheep.\nLike Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately\nassociated with age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages:\nsensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).\nTable 9.2Piaget\u2019s Stages of Cognitive Development\nAge Developmental\nStage Description\n(years) issues\n0\u20132 Sensorimotor World experienced through senses and actions Object\npermanence\nStranger anxiety\n2\u20136 Preoperational Use words and images to represent things, but lack Pretend play\nlogical reasoning Egocentrism\nLanguage\ndevelopment\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development 295\nTable 9.2Piaget\u2019s Stages of Cognitive Development\nAge Developmental\nStage Description\n(years) issues\n7\u201311 Concrete Understand concrete events and analogies Conservation\noperational logically; perform arithmetical operations Mathematical\ntransformations\n12\u2013 Formal Formal operations Abstract logic\noperational Utilize abstract reasoning Moral reasoning\nThe first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old.

Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one\nviewpoint, and are asked what another person at a different viewpoint would see in\nthe same scene. Watch the Three-Mountain Task in action in thisshort video\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/WonderYears)from the University of Minnesota and\nthe Science Museum of Minnesota.\nPiaget\u2019s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In\nthis stage, children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use\nof numbers and start to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and\nunderstand transformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the\nopposite of division. In this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something\nchanges shape, its mass, volume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall,\nthinglasstoashort,fatglass,youstillhavethesameamountofwater.RememberKeikoandKennyand\nthe pizza?

Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about\nconcreteevents,childrenintheformaloperationalstagecanalsodealwithabstractideasandhypothetical\nsituations.Childreninthisstagecanuseabstractthinkingtoproblemsolve,lookatalternativesolutions,\nandtestthesesolutions.Inadolescence,arenewedegocentrismoccurs.Forexample,a15-year-oldwitha\nverysmallpimpleonherfacemightthinkitishugeandincrediblyvisible,underthemistakenimpression\nthat others must share her perceptions.\nBeyond Formal Operational Thought\nAs with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget\u2019s ideas have come under\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development 297\ncriticism based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a\nmodel of development that is more continuous than Piaget\u2019s discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002;\nSiegler, 2005, 2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget\ndescribes (Baillargeon, 2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).\nAccording to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which\ndevelopsbetween11and20yearsold.However,manydevelopmentalpsychologistsdisagreewithPiaget,\nsuggesting a fifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches, 1984;\nCommons&Bresette,2006;Sinnott,1998).Inpostformalthinking,decisionsaremadebasedonsituations\nand circumstances, and logic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on\ncontexts.Onewaythatwecanseethedifferencebetweenanadultinpostformalthoughtandanadolescent\nin formal operations is in terms of how they handle emotionally charged issues.\nIt seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As we attempt to solve\nproblems, we tend to think more deeply about many areas of our lives, such as relationships, work,\nand politics (Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 1999). Because of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past\nexperiencestohelpthemsolvenewproblems.Problem-solvingstrategiesusingpostformalthoughtvary,\ndependingonthesituation.Whatdoesthismean?Adultscanrecognize,forexample,thatwhatseemsto\nbeanidealsolutiontoaproblematworkinvolvingadisagreementwithacolleaguemaynotbethebest\nsolution to a disagreement with a significant other.\nTHEORY OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT\nA major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong.\nPsychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927\u20131987) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regarding\ncognitivedevelopment.Kohlbergbelievedthatmoraldevelopment,likecognitivedevelopment,followsa\nseries of stages. To develop this theory, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to people of all ages, and then\nheanalyzedtheiranswerstofindevidenceoftheirparticularstageofmoraldevelopment.Beforereading\nabout the stages, take a minute to consider how you would answer one of Kohlberg's best-known moral\ndilemmas, commonly known as the Heinz dilemma:\nInEurope,awomanwasneardeathfromaspecialkindofcancer.Therewasonedrugthatthe\ndoctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had\nrecentlydiscovered.Thedrugwasexpensivetomake,butthedruggistwaschargingtentimes\nwhat the drug cost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small\ndose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the\nmoney, but he could only get together about $1,000, which is half of what it cost. He told the\ndruggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the\ndruggistsaid:\u201cNo,IdiscoveredthedrugandI'mgoingtomakemoneyfromit.\u201dSoHeinzgot\ndesperateandbrokeintotheman'sstoretostealthedrugforhiswife.Shouldthehusbandhave\ndone that? (Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379)\nHow would you answer this dilemma? Kohlberg was not interested in whether you answer yes or no to\nthe dilemma: Instead, he was interested in the reasoning behind your answer.\nAfter presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas, Kohlberg reviewed people\u2019s\nresponses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning (Figure 9.6). According to Kohlberg,\nanindividualprogressesfromthecapacityforpre-conventionalmorality(beforeage9)tothecapacityfor\nconventionalmorality(earlyadolescence),andtowardattainingpost-conventionalmorality(onceformal\noperational thought is attained), which only a few fully achieve. Kohlberg placed in the highest stage\nresponses that reflected the reasoning that Heinz should steal the drug because his wife\u2019s life is more\nimportantthanthepharmacistmakingmoney.Thevalueofahumanlifeoverridesthepharmacist\u2019sgreed. 298 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\nFigure 9.6 Kohlberg identified three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-\nconventional: Each level is associated with increasingly complex stages of moral development.\nIt is important to realize that even those people who have the most sophisticated, post-conventional\nreasons for some choices may make other choices for the simplest of pre-conventional reasons. Many\npsychologists agree with Kohlberg's theory of moral development but point out that moral reasoning is\nvery different from moral behavior. Sometimes what we say we would do in a situation is not what we\nactually do in that situation. In other words, we might \u201ctalk the talk,\u201d but not \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d\nHow does this theory apply to males and females? Kohlberg (1969) felt that more males than females\nmovepaststagefourintheirmoraldevelopment.Hewentontonotethatwomenseemtobedeficientin\ntheir moral reasoning abilities. These ideas were not well received by Carol Gilligan, a research assistant\nof Kohlberg, who consequently developed her own ideas of moral development. In her groundbreaking\nbook, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women\u2019s Development, Gilligan (1982) criticized her\nformer mentor\u2019s theory because it was based only on upper class White men and boys. She argued that\nwomenarenotdeficientintheirmoralreasoning\u2014sheproposedthatmalesandfemalesreasondifferently.\nGirls and women focus more on staying connected and the importance of interpersonal relationships.\nTherefore,intheHeinzdilemma,manygirlsandwomenrespondthatHeinzshouldnotstealthemedicine.\nTheirreasoningisthatifhestealsthemedicine,isarrested,andisputinjail,thenheandhiswifewillbe\nseparated, and she could die while he is still in prison.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development 299\n9.3 Stages of Development\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the stages of prenatal development and recognize the importance of prenatal care\n\u2022 Discuss physical, cognitive, and emotional development that occurs from infancy through\nchildhood\n\u2022 Discuss physical, cognitive, and emotional development that occurs during adolescence\n\u2022 Discuss physical, cognitive, and emotional development that occurs in adulthood\nFrom the moment we are born until the moment we die, we continue to develop.\nAsdiscussedatthebeginningofthischapter,developmentalpsychologistsoftendivideourdevelopment\nintothreeareas:physicaldevelopment,cognitivedevelopment,andpsychosocialdevelopment.Mirroring\nErikson\u2019s stages, lifespan development is divided into different stages that are based on age.

The developing\nfetus is completely dependent on the mother for life. It is important that the mother takes good care of\nherself and receives prenatal care, which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of\nboth the mother and the fetus (Figure 9.9). According to the National Institutes of Health ([NIH], 2013),\nroutineprenatalcareisimportantbecauseitcanreducetheriskofcomplicationstothemotherandfetus\nduring pregnancy.

There are different types of teratogens. Alcohol and most drugs cross the\nplacenta and affect the fetus. Alcohol is not safe to drink in any amount during pregnancy.

Although small, a newborn is not completely\nhelpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities help him interact with the environment from the\nmoment of birth. All healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes: inborn automatic responses to\nparticular forms of stimulation. Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex\nbehaviors\u2014thesereflexesarecrucialtosurvival.Theyarepresentinbabieswhosebrainsaredeveloping\nnormally and usually disappear around 4\u20135 months old.

The sucking reflex is\nthe automatic, unlearned, sucking motions that infants do with their mouths. Several other interesting\nnewborn reflexes can be observed. For instance, if you put your finger into a newborn\u2019s hand, you will\nwitness the grasping reflex, in which a baby automatically grasps anything that touches his palms.

Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show a\npreferenceforfaces.Babieswhoarejustafewdaysoldalsopreferhumanvoices,theywilllistentovoices\nlonger than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer\ntheirmother\u2019svoiceoverastranger\u2019svoice(Mills&Melhuish,1974).Inaninterestingexperiment,3-week-\nold babies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant\u2019s mother\u2019s voice and of a stranger\u2019s\nvoice. When the infants heard their mother\u2019s voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills &\nMelhuish,1974).Newbornsalsohaveastrongsenseofsmell.Forinstance,newbornbabiescandistinguish\nthesmelloftheirownmotherfromthatofothers.InastudybyMacFarlane(1978),1-week-oldbabieswho\nwerebeingbreastfedwereplacedbetweentwogauzepads.Onegauzepadwasfromthebraofanursing\nmotherwhowasastranger,andtheothergauzepadwasfromthebraoftheinfant\u2019sownmother.More\nthan two-thirds of the week-old babies turned toward the gauze pad with their mother\u2019s scent.\nPhysical Development\nIn infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body\u2019s physical development is rapid (Figure 9.10).\nOnaverage,newbornsweighbetween5and10pounds,andanewborn\u2019sweighttypicallydoublesinsix\nmonths and triples in one year. By 2 years old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that\na 2 year old should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds.

For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size,\nand by 6 years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages\n3\u20136), the frontal lobes grow rapidly. Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this\nbook,thefrontallobesareassociatedwithplanning,reasoning,memory,andimpulsecontrol.Therefore,\nbythetimechildrenreachschoolage,theyaredevelopmentallycapableofcontrollingtheirattentionand\nbehavior.Throughtheelementaryschoolyears,thefrontal,temporal,occipital,andparietallobesallgrow\nin size. The brain growth spurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget\u2019s sequence of cognitive\ndevelopment, so that significant changes in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb &\nWhishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier, Turner, & Peuster, 1992).\nMotordevelopmentoccursinanorderlysequenceasinfantsmovefromreflexivereactions(e.g.,sucking\nandrooting) tomoreadvanced motor functioning. Forinstance,babiesfirstlearntoholdtheirheadsup,\nthen to sit with assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.\nMotor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on\nthe muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy,\nwriting with a pencil, and using a spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control\nour arms and legs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).\nAs motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve\n(Table 9.4).Foreachmilestonethereisanaverageage,aswellasarangeofagesinwhichthemilestone\nshouldbereached.Anexampleofadevelopmentalmilestoneissitting.Onaverage,mostbabiessitalone\nat 7 months old. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this\nmilestone between 5 and 9 months old. In another example, babies on average are able to hold up their\nhead at 6 weeks old, and 90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not\nholding up his head by 4 months old, he is showing a delay. If the child is displaying delays on several\nmilestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child\u2019s\npediatrician. Some developmental delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.\nTable 9.4Developmental Milestones, Ages 2\u20135 Years\nAge\nPhysical Personal/Social Language Cognitive\n(years)\n2 Kicks a ball; Plays alongside Points to objects when Sorts shapes and\nwalks up other children; named; puts 2\u20134 words colors; follows 2-step\nand down copies adults together in a sentence instructions\nstairs 306 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\nTable 9.4Developmental Milestones, Ages 2\u20135 Years\nAge\nPhysical Personal/Social Language Cognitive\n(years)\n3 Climbs and Takes turns; Names familiar things; Plays make believe;\nruns; pedals expresses many uses pronouns works toys with parts\ntricycle emotions; dresses (levers, handles)\nself\n4 Catches Prefers social play Knows songs and Names colors and\nballs; uses to solo play; knows rhymes by memory numbers; begins\nscissors likes and interests writing letters\n5 Hops and Distinguishes real Speaks clearly; uses full Counts to 10 or higher;\nswings; uses from pretend; likes sentences prints some letters and\nfork and to please friends copies basic shapes\nspoon\nCognitive Development\nIn addition to rapid physical growth, young children also exhibit significant development of their\ncognitive abilities. Piaget thought that children\u2019s ability to understand objects\u2014such as learning that\na rattle makes a noise when shaken\u2014was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures\nand interacts with the environment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect.\nResearchershavefoundthatevenveryyoungchildrenunderstandobjectsandhowtheyworklongbefore\nthey have experience with those objects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For\nexample, children as young as 3 months old demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that\nthey had only viewed and did not have prior experience with them. In one study, 3-month-old infants\nwere shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a screen. The box, which appeared solid but was\nactually hollow, was placed next to the track. The truck rolled past the box as would be expected. Then\ntheboxwasplacedonthetracktoblockthepathofthetruck.Whenthetruckwasrolleddownthetrack\nthis time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more time looking at this impossible\nevent (Figure 9.11). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects cannot pass through each\nother.Baillargeon\u2019sfindingssuggestthatveryyoungchildrenhaveanunderstandingofobjectsandhow\nthey work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to their limited\nexperiences in the world.\nFigure 9.11 In Baillargeon\u2019s study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an\nunobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an\nobstruction.\nJustastherearephysicalmilestonesthatweexpectchildrentoreach,therearealsocognitivemilestones.\nIt is helpful to be aware of these milestones as children gain new abilities to think, problem solve, and\ncommunicate.Forexample,infantsshaketheirhead\u201cno\u201daround6\u20139months,andtheyrespondtoverbal\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development 307\nrequests to do things like \u201cwave bye-bye\u201d or \u201cblow a kiss\u201d around 9\u201312 months.

Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in\nappropriate places when you ask them to find objects.\nPreschool-agechildren(i.e.,3\u20135yearsold)alsomakesteadyprogressincognitivedevelopment.Notonly\ncan they count, name colors, and tell you their name and age, but they can also make some decisions on\ntheirown,suchaschoosinganoutfittowear.Preschool-agechildrenunderstandbasictimeconceptsand\nsequencing(e.g.,beforeandafter),andtheycanpredictwhatwillhappennextinastory.Theyalsobegin\nto enjoy the use of humor in stories.

Preschool-age children love to ask \u201cWhy?\u201d\nAn important cognitive change occurs in children this age. Recall that Piaget described 2\u20133 year olds as\negocentric,meaningthattheydonothaveanawarenessofothers\u2019pointsofview.Between3and5years\nold, children come to understand that people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that are different from\ntheir own. This is known as theory-of-mind (TOM). Children can use this skill to tease others, persuade\ntheirparentstopurchaseacandybar,orunderstandwhyasiblingmightbeangry.Whenchildrendevelop\nTOM, they can recognize that others have false beliefs (Dennett, 1987; Callaghan et al., 2005).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFalse-belief tasks are useful in determining a child\u2019s acquisition of theory-of-mind\n(TOM). Take a look at thisvideo clip (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/crayons)\nshowing a false-belief task involving a box of crayons.\nCognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood (6\u201311 years old). Thought processes\nbecome more logical and organized when dealing with concrete information (Figure 9.12). Children at\nthis age understand concepts such as the past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and\nwork toward goals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and\ncause-and-effect relationships. However, children\u2019s attention spans tend to bevery limited untiltheyare\naround 11 years old. After that point, it begins to improve through adulthood.\nFigure 9.12 Because they understand luck and fairness, children in middle and late childhood (6\u201311 years old) are\nable to follow rules for games. (credit: Edwin Martinez)\nOne well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. As mentioned earlier, the\norderinwhichchildrenlearnlanguagestructuresisconsistentacrosschildrenandcultures(Hatch,1983).\nYou\u2019vealsolearnedthatsomepsychologicalresearchershaveproposedthatchildrenpossessabiological 308 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\npredisposition for language acquisition.\nStarting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies\napparently recognize their mother\u2019s voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their\nmothers and foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with\naudible language (Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).\nChildrencommunicateinformationthroughgesturinglongbeforetheyspeak,andthereissomeevidence\nthat gesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). In\nterms of producing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable\ncombinationofaconsonantandavowelsound(e.g.,cooorba).Interestingly,babiesreplicatesoundsfrom\ntheir own languages. A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby whose\nparentsspeakSpanishorUrdu.Aftercooing, thebabystartstobabble.Babblingbeginswithrepeatinga\nsyllable, such as ma-ma, da-da, or ba-ba. When a baby is about 12 months old, we expect her to say her\nfirst word for meaning, and to start combining words for meaning at about 18 months.\nAt about 2 years old, a toddler uses between 50 and 200 words; by 3 years old they have a vocabulary\nofupto1,000wordsandcanspeakinsentences.Duringtheearlychildhoodyears,children'svocabulary\nincreasesatarapidpace.Thisissometimesreferredtoasthe\u201cvocabularyspurt\u201dandhasbeenclaimedto\ninvolveanexpansioninvocabularyatarateof10\u201320newwordsperweek.Recentresearchmayindicate\nthatwhilesomechildrenexperiencethesespurts,itisfarfromuniversal(asdiscussedinGanger&Brent,\n2004). It has been estimated that, 5 year olds understand about 6,000 words, speak 2,000 words, and can\ndefine words and question their meanings. They can rhyme and name the days of the week. Seven year\nolds speak fluently and use slang and clich\u00e9s (Stork & Widdowson, 1974).\nWhataccountsforsuchdramaticlanguagelearningbychildren?BehavioristB.F.Skinnerthoughtthatwe\nlearn language in response to reinforcement or feedback, such as through parental approval or through\nbeing understood. For example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, \u201cme juice,\u201d to\nwhich his mother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. Noam Chomsky (1957) criticized\nSkinner\u2019s theory and proposed that we are all born with an innate capacity to learn language. Chomsky\ncalled this mechanism a language acquisition device (LAD). Who is correct? Both Chomsky and Skinner\nare right. Remember that we are a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now believe that\nlanguageacquisitionispartiallyinbornandpartiallylearnedthroughourinteractionswithourlinguistic\nenvironment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995; Stork & Widdowson, 1974).\nAttachment\nPsychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with others, and understand\nand manage their feelings.

How does neglect affect these bonds?\nWhat accounts for children\u2019s attachment differences?\nResearchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer\nthese questions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys. He separated\nnewborn monkeys from their mothers. Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers.

Watch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/monkeystudy)to see actual\nfootage of Harlow\u2019s monkey studies.\nBuilding on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept of attachment theory.\nHedefinedattachmentastheaffectionalbondortiethataninfantformswiththemother(Bowlby,1969).\nAn infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional\ndevelopment. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues\nthroughout life. He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and\nchild (1988). A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his\nsurroundings. Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be\nresponsivetothechild\u2019sphysical,social,andemotionalneeds;andthecaregiverandchildmustengagein\nmutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969) (Figure 9.13).\nFigure 9.13 Mutually enjoyable interactions promote the mother-infant bond. (credit: Peter Shanks)\nWhile Bowlby thought attachment was an all-or-nothing process, Mary Ainsworth\u2019s (1970) research\nshowed otherwise. Ainsworth wanted to know if children differ in the ways they bond, and if so, why.\nTofindtheanswers,sheusedtheStrangeSituationproceduretostudyattachmentbetweenmothersand\ntheir infants (1970).

The most common\ntype of attachment\u2014also considered the healthiest\u2014is called secure attachment (Figure 9.14). In this\ntype of attachment, the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger. The attachment figure is used as a\nsecure base to explore the environment and is sought out in times of stress. Securely attached children\nwere distressed when their caregivers left the room in the Strange Situation experiment, but when their\ncaregivers returned, the securely attached children were happy to see them. Securely attached children\nhave caregivers who are sensitive and responsive to their needs. 310 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\nFigure 9.14 In secure attachment, the parent provides a secure base for the toddler, allowing him to securely\nexplore his environment.

If you place a baby in front of a\nmirror, she will reach out to touch her image, thinking it is another baby. However, by about 18 months\na toddler will recognize that the person in the mirror is herself. How do we know this? In a well-known\nexperiment, a researcher placed a red dot of paint on children\u2019s noses before putting them in front of a\nmirror(Amsterdam,1972).Commonlyknownasthemirrortest,thisbehaviorisdemonstratedbyhumans\nand a few other species and is considered evidence of self-recognition (Archer, 1992).

American children raised by authoritative parents tend to have high self-esteem and\nsocial skills. However, effective parenting styles vary as a function of culture and, as Small (1999) points\nout, the authoritative style is not necessarily preferred or appropriate in all cultures.\nIn authoritarian style, the parent places high value on conformity and obedience. The parents are often\nstrict, tightly monitor their children, and express little warmth. In contrast to the authoritative style,\nauthoritarianparentsprobablywouldnotrelaxbedtimerulesduringavacationbecausetheyconsiderthe\nrules to be set, and they expect obedience.

For instance, first-generation Chinese American\nchildren raised by authoritarian parents did just as well in school as their peers who were raised by\nauthoritative parents (Russell et al., 2010).\nFor parents who employ the permissive style of parenting, the kids run the show and anything goes.\nPermissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment.

Not surprisingly, children raised by permissive parents tend to lack self-\ndiscipline, and the permissive parenting style is negatively associated with grades (Dornbusch, Ritter,\nLeiderman, Roberts, & Fraleigh, 1987). The permissive style may also contribute to other risky behaviors\nsuch as alcohol abuse (Bahr & Hoffman, 2010), risky sexual behavior especially among female children\n(Donenberg, Wilson, Emerson, & Bryant, 2002), and increased display of disruptive behaviors by male\nchildren(Parentetal.,2011).However,therearesomepositiveoutcomes associated withchildrenraised\nbypermissiveparents.Theytendtohavehigherself-esteem,bettersocialskills,andreportlowerlevelsof\ndepression (Darling, 1999).\nWith the uninvolved style of parenting, the parents are indifferent, uninvolved, and sometimes referred\nto as neglectful. They don\u2019t respond to the child\u2019s needs and make relatively few demands.

It builds creativity, problem solving skills, and social relationships. Play also allows children to\ndevelop a theory-of-mind as they imaginatively take on the perspective of others.\nOutdoor play allows children the opportunity to directly experience and sense the world around them. While\ndoing so, they may collect objects that they come across and develop lifelong interests and hobbies.

In addition, some schools have taken away recess time for\nchildren in a push for students to do better on standardized tests, and many schools commonly use loss of\nrecess as a form of punishment. Do you agree with these practices? Why or why not?\nADOLESCENCE\nAdolescence is a socially constructed concept. In pre-industrial society, children were considered adults\nwhen they reached physical maturity, but today we have an extended time between childhood and\nadulthoodcalledadolescence.Adolescenceistheperiodofdevelopmentthatbeginsatpubertyandends\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development 313\nat emerging adulthood, which is discussed later. In the United States, adolescence is seen as a time to\ndevelop independence from parents while remaining connected to them (Figure 9.15). The typical age\nrange of adolescence is from 12 to 18 years, and this stage of development also has some predictable\nphysical, cognitive, and psychosocial milestones.\nFigure 9.15 Peers are a primary influence on our development in adolescence. (credit: Sheila Tostes)\nPhysical Development\nAs noted above, adolescence begins with puberty. While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is\npredictable, the onset and pace of puberty vary widely. Several physical changes occur during puberty,\nsuch as adrenarche and gonadarche, the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands, respectively.\nAlsoduringthistime,primaryandsecondarysexualcharacteristicsdevelopandmature.Primarysexual\ncharacteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction, like the uterus and ovaries in females\nand testes in males. Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not\ndirectly involve sex organs, such as development of breasts and hips in girls, and development of facial\nhairandadeepenedvoiceinboys.Girlsexperiencemenarche,thebeginningofmenstrualperiods,usually\naround 12\u201313 years old, and boys experiencespermarche, the first ejaculation, around 13\u201314 years old.\nDuringpuberty,bothsexesexperiencearapidincreaseinheight(i.e.,growthspurt).Forgirlsthisbegins\nbetween 8 and 13 years old, with adult height reached between 10 and 16 years old. Boys begin their\ngrowthspurtslightlylater,usuallybetween10and16yearsold,andreachtheiradultheightbetween13\nand17yearsold.Bothnature(i.e.,genes)andnurture(e.g.,nutrition,medications,andmedicalconditions)\ncan influence height.\nBecause rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty can be a source of\npride or embarrassment. Early maturing boys tend to be stronger, taller, and more athletic than their\nlater maturing peers. They are usually more popular, confident, and independent, but they are also at a\ngreaterriskforsubstanceabuseandearlysexualactivity(Flannery,Rowe,&Gulley,1993;Kaltiala-Heino,\nRimpela, Rissanen, & Rantanen, 2001). Early maturing girls may be teased or overtly admired, which\ncan cause them to feel self-conscious about their developing bodies. These girls are at a higher risk for\ndepression,substanceabuse,andeatingdisorders(Ge,Conger,&Elder,2001;Graber,Lewinsohn,Seeley,\n& Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Striegel-Moore & Cachelin, 1999). Late blooming boys and girls (i.e., they develop\nmoreslowlythantheirpeers)mayfeelself-consciousabouttheirlackofphysicaldevelopment.Negative\nfeelings are particularly a problem for late maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for depression and\nconflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and more likely to be bullied (Pollack & Shuster, 2000).\nThe adolescent brain also remains under development. Up until puberty, brain cells continue to bloom\nin the frontal region. Adolescents engage in increased risk-taking behaviors and emotional outbursts\npossibly because the frontal lobes of their brains are still developing (Figure 9.16). Recall that this area\nis responsible for judgment, impulse control, and planning, and it is still maturing into early adulthood\n(Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005). 314 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\nFigure 9.16 Brain growth continues into the early 20s. The development of the frontal lobe, in particular, is important\nduring this stage.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAccording to neuroscientist Jay Giedd in the Frontline video \u201cInside the Teenage\nBrain\u201d (2013), \u201cIt\u2019s sort of unfair to expect [teens] to have adult levels of\norganizational skills or decision-making before their brains are finished being built.\u201d\nWatch this segment on\u201cThe Wiring of the Adolescent Brain\u201d\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/wiringbrain)to find out more about the developing\nbrain during adolescence.\nCognitive Development\nMore complex thinking abilities emerge during adolescence. Some researchers suggest this is due to\nincreasesinprocessingspeedandefficiencyratherthanastheresultofanincreaseinmentalcapacity\u2014in\nother words, due to improvements in existing skills rather than development of new ones (Bjorkland,\n1987; Case, 1985). During adolescence, teenagers move beyond concrete thinking and become capable of\nabstractthought.RecallthatPiagetreferstothisstageasformaloperationalthought.Teenthinkingisalso\ncharacterized by the ability to consider multiple points of view, imagine hypothetical situations, debate\nideasandopinions(e.g.,politics,religion,andjustice),andformnewideas(Figure 9.17).Inaddition,it\u2019s\nnot uncommon for adolescents to question authority or challenge established societal norms.\nCognitive empathy, also known as theory-of-mind (which we discussed earlier with regard to\negocentrism), relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others (Shamay-\nTsoory, Tomer, & Aharon-Peretz, 2005). Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an\nimportant component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance. According to one longitudinal\nstudy, levels of cognitive empathy begin rising in girls around 13 years old, and around 15 years old in\nboys (Van der Graaff et al., 2013).

Other teens develop identities that are in opposition to their parents but align\nwith a peer group. This is common as peer relationships become a central focus in adolescents\u2019 lives.\nAs adolescents work to form their identities, they pull away from their parents, and the peer group\nbecomes very important (Shanahan, McHale, Osgood, & Crouter, 2007).

Stanley Hall, a pioneer in the study of adolescent development. Only small numbers\nof teens have major conflicts with their parents (Steinberg & Morris, 2001), and most disagreements are\nminor. For example, in a study of over 1,800 parents of adolescents from various cultural and ethnic\ngroups, Barber (1994) found that conflicts occurred over day-to-day issues such as homework, money,\ncurfews, clothing, chores, and friends.

(credit: Philippe Put)\nPsychosocial Development\nThere are many theories about the social and emotional aspects of aging. Some aspects of healthy aging 318 Chapter 9 | Lifespan Development\ninclude activities, social connectedness, and the role of a person\u2019s culture. According to many theorists,\nincluding George Vaillant (2002), who studied and analyzed over 50 years of data, we need to have and\ncontinuetofindmeaningthroughoutourlives.Forthoseinearlyandmiddleadulthood,meaningisfound\nthroughwork(Sterns&Huyck,2001)andfamilylife(Markus,Ryff,Curan,&Palmersheim,2004).These\nareas relate to the tasks that Erikson referred to as generativity and intimacy. As mentioned previously,\nadults tend to define themselves by what they do\u2014their careers. Earnings peak during this time, yet job\nsatisfaction is more closely tied to work that involves contact with other people, is interesting, provides\nopportunities for advancement, and allows some independence (Mohr & Zoghi, 2006) than it is to salary\n(Iyengar, Wells, & Schwartz, 2006). How might being unemployed or being in a dead-end job challenge\nadult well-being?\nPositive relationships with significant others in our adult years have been found to contribute to a state\nof well-being (Ryff & Singer, 2009). Most adults in the United States identify themselves through their\nrelationships with family\u2014particularly with spouses, children, and parents (Markus et al., 2004). While\nraisingchildrencanbestressful,especiallywhentheyareyoung,researchsuggeststhatparentsreapthe\nrewardsdowntheroad,asadultchildrentendtohaveapositiveeffectonparentalwell-being(Umberson,\nPudrovska, & Reczek, 2010). Having a stable marriage has also been found to contribute to well-being\nthroughout adulthood (Vaillant, 2002).\nAnotheraspectofpositiveagingisbelievedtobesocialconnectednessandsocialsupport.Aswegetolder,\nsocioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number,\nbut remain as close, if not more close than in our earlier years (Carstensen, 1992) (Figure 9.20).\nFigure 9.20 Social support is important as we age.

The aim of hospice is\nto help provide a death with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment,\nwhich is usually outside of a hospital setting. In 1974, Florence Wald founded the first hospice in the\nUnited States. Today, hospice provides care for 1.65 million Americans and their families. Because of\nhospice care, many terminally ill people are able to spend their last days at home.\nFigure 9.21 In some cultures, people\u2019s bodies may be buried in a cemetery after death.

Family members receive emotional support\nand are regularly informed of their loved one\u2019s treatment and condition. The family member\u2019s burden\nof care is also reduced (McMillan et al., 2006). Both the patient and the patient\u2019s family members report\nincreasedfamilysupport,increasedsocialsupport,andimprovedcopingwhilereceivinghospiceservices\n(Godkin et al., 1984).\nHow do you think you might react if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness like cancer? Elizabeth\nK\u00fcbler-Ross(1969),whoworkedwiththefoundersofhospicecare,describedtheprocessofanindividual\naccepting his own death. She proposed five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and\nacceptance. Most individuals experience these stages, but the stages may occur in different orders,\ndepending on the individual. In addition, not all people experience all of the stages. It is also important\nto note that some psychologists believe that the more a dying person fights death, the more likely he\nis to remain stuck in the denial phase. This could make it difficult for the dying person to face death\nwithdignity.However,otherpsychologistsbelievethatnotfacingdeathuntiltheveryendisanadaptive\ncoping mechanism for some people.\nWhether due to illness or old age, not everyone facing death or the loss of a loved one experiences the\nnegative emotions outlined in the K\u00fcbler-Ross model (Nolen-Hoeksema & Larson, 1999). For example,\nresearchsuggeststhatpeoplewithreligiousorspiritualbeliefsarebetterabletocopewithdeathbecause\nof their hope in an afterlife and because of social support from religious or spiritual associations (Hood,\nSpilka,Hunsberger,&Corsuch,1996;McIntosh,Silver,&Wortman,1993;Paloutzian,1996;Samarel,1991;\nWortman & Park, 2008).\nA prominent example of a person creating meaning through death is Randy Pausch, who was a well-\nlovedandrespectedprofessoratCarnegieMellonUniversity.Diagnosedwithterminalpancreaticcancer\ninhismid-40sandgivenonly3\u20136monthstolive,Pauschfocusedonlivinginafulfillingwayinthetime\nhe had left.

This field of\npsychology is studied by developmental psychologists. They view development as a lifelong process\nthat can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains: physical, cognitive development,\nand psychosocial. There are several theories of development that focus on the following issues: whether\ndevelopmentiscontinuousordiscontinuous,whetherdevelopmentfollowsonecourseormany,andthe\nrelative influence of nature versus nurture on development.\n9.2Lifespan Theories\nTherearemanytheoriesregardinghowbabiesandchildrengrowanddevelopintohappy,healthyadults.\nSigmund Freud suggested that we pass through a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is\nfocused on certain erogenous zones on the body.

Social supports\nthrough family and friends remain important as we age.\n9.4Death and Dying\nDeath marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we might react when facing death.\nK\u00fcbler-Ross developed a five-stage model of grief as a way to explain this process.

In addition to biological motives, motivations can\nbe intrinsic (arising from internal factors) or extrinsic (arising from external factors) (Figure 10.2).\nIntrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they\nbring, while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others.\nFigure 10.2 Intrinsic motivation comes from within the individual, while extrinsic motivation comes from outside the\nindividual.\nThinkaboutwhyyouarecurrentlyincollege.Areyouherebecauseyouenjoylearningandwanttopursue\naneducationtomakeyourselfamorewell-roundedindividual?Ifso,thenyouareintrinsicallymotivated.\nHowever,ifyouareherebecauseyouwanttogetacollegedegreetomakeyourselfmoremarketablefor\nahigh-payingcareerortosatisfythedemandsofyourparents,thenyourmotivationismoreextrinsicin\nnature.\nIn reality, our motivations are often a mix of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the nature of the\nmix of these factors might change over time (often in ways that seem counter-intuitive). There is an old\nadage:\u201cChoose ajob thatyoulove, andyouwillneverhavetowork adayinyourlife,\u201dmeaningthatif\nyouenjoyyouroccupation, workdoesn\u2019t seemlike...well,work.Someresearchsuggests thatthisisn\u2019t\nnecessarily the case (Daniel & Esser, 1980; Deci, 1972; Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999).

(credit: Agust\u00edn Ruiz)\nOther studies suggest that intrinsic motivation may not be so vulnerable to the effects of extrinsic\nreinforcements, and in fact, reinforcements such as verbal praise might actually increase intrinsic\nmotivation (Arnold, 1976; Cameron & Pierce, 1994). In that case, Odessa\u2019s motivation to bake in her free\ntime might remain high if, for example, customers regularly compliment her baking or cake decorating\nskills.\nThese apparent discrepancies in the researchers\u2019 findings may be understood by considering several\nfactors. For one, physical reinforcement (such as money) and verbal reinforcement (such as praise) may\naffect an individual in very different ways. In fact, tangible rewards (i.e., money) tend to have more\nnegative effects on intrinsic motivation than do intangible rewards (i.e., praise). Furthermore, the\nexpectation of the extrinsic motivator by an individual is crucial: If the person expects to receive an\nextrinsic reward, then intrinsic motivation for the task tends to be reduced. If, however, there is no such\nexpectation, andtheextrinsic motivation ispresented asasurprise, thenintrinsic motivation forthetask\ntends to persist (Deci et al., 1999).\nIneducationalsettings,studentsaremorelikelytoexperienceintrinsicmotivationtolearnwhentheyfeel\na sense of belonging and respect in the classroom. This internalization can be enhanced if the evaluative\naspects of the classroom are de-emphasized and if students feel that they exercise some control over the\nlearning environment. Furthermore, providing students with activities that are challenging, yet doable,\nalong with a rationale for engaging in various learning activities can enhance intrinsic motivation for\nthose tasks (Niemiec & Ryan, 2009). Consider Hakim, a first-year law student with two courses this\nsemester:FamilyLawandCriminalLaw.TheFamilyLawprofessorhasaratherintimidatingclassroom:\nHe likes to put students on the spot with tough questions, which often leaves students feeling belittled\nor embarrassed. Grades are based exclusively on quizzes and exams, and the instructor posts results of\neachtestontheclassroomdoor.Incontrast,theCriminalLawprofessorfacilitatesclassroomdiscussions\nand respectful debates in small groups. The majority of the course grade is not exam-based, but centers\non a student-designed research project on a crime issue of the student\u2019s choice. Research suggests that\nHakimwillbelessintrinsicallymotivatedinhisFamilyLawcourse,wherestudentsareintimidatedinthe\nclassroom setting, and there is an emphasis on teacher-driven evaluations. Hakim is likely to experience\na higher level of intrinsic motivation in his Criminal Law course, where the class setting encourages\ninclusivecollaborationandarespectforideas,andwherestudentshavemoreinfluenceovertheirlearning\nactivities.\nTHEORIES ABOUT MOTIVATION\nWilliam James (1842\u20131910) was an important contributor to early research into motivation, and he is\noften referred to as the father of psychology in the United States. James theorized that behavior was\ndriven by a number of instincts, which aid survival (Figure 10.4). From a biological perspective, an\ninstinct is a species-specific pattern of behavior that is not learned. There was, however, considerable\ncontroversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct. James proposed\nseveral dozen special human instincts, but many of his contemporaries had their own lists that differed. 332 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation\nA mother\u2019s protection of her baby, the urge to lick sugar, and hunting prey were among the human\nbehaviors proposed as true instincts during James\u2019s era. This view\u2014that human behavior is driven by\ninstincts\u2014received a fair amount of criticism because of the undeniable role of learning in shaping all\nsorts of human behavior. In fact, as early as the 1900s, some instinctive behaviors were experimentally\ndemonstratedtoresultfromassociativelearning(recallwhenyoulearnedaboutWatson\u2019sconditioningof\nfear response in \u201cLittle Albert\u201d) (Faris, 1921).\nFigure 10.4 (a) William James proposed the instinct theory of motivation, asserting that behavior is driven by\ninstincts. (b) In humans, instincts may include behaviors such as an infant\u2019s rooting for a nipple and sucking. (credit b:\nmodification of work by \"Mothering Touch\"/Flickr)\nAnother early theory of motivation proposed that the maintenance of homeostasis is particularly\nimportantindirectingbehavior.Youmayrecallfromyourearlierreadingthathomeostasisisthetendency\nto maintain a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system. In a body system, a control center\n(which is often part of the brain) receives input from receptors (which are often complexes of neurons).\nThecontrolcenterdirectseffectors(whichmaybeotherneurons)tocorrectanyimbalancedetectedbythe\ncontrol center.\nAccording to the drive theory of motivation, deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs.\nTheseneedsresultinpsychologicaldrivestatesthatdirectbehaviortomeettheneedand,ultimately,bring\nthe system back to homeostasis.

As you recall from\nyour study of learning, these theories assert that there is an optimal level of arousal that we all try\nto maintain (Figure 10.6). If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some sort of\nstimulation.Ontheotherhand,ifweareoveraroused,wewillengageinbehaviorstoreduceourarousal\n(Berlyne, 1960). Most students have experienced this need to maintain optimal levels of arousal over the\ncourse of their academic career. Think about how much stress students experience toward the end of\nspring semester. They feel overwhelmed with seemingly endless exams, papers, and major assignments\nthatmustbecompletedontime.Theyprobablyyearnfortherestandrelaxationthatawaitsthemoverthe\nextendedsummerbreak.However,oncetheyfinishthesemester,itdoesn\u2019ttaketoolongbeforetheybegin\nto feel bored. Generally, by the time the next semester is beginning in the fall, many students are quite\nhappy to return to school. This is an example of how arousal theory works.\nFigure 10.6 The concept of optimal arousal in relation to performance on a task is depicted here. Performance is\nmaximized at the optimal level of arousal, and it tapers off during under- and overarousal.\nSo what is the optimal level of arousal? What level leads to the best performance? Research shows that\nmoderate arousal is generally best; when arousal is very high or very low, performance tends to suffer\n(Yerkes&Dodson,1908).Thinkofyourarousallevelregardingtakinganexamforthisclass.Ifyourlevel\nisverylow,suchasboredomandapathy,yourperformancewilllikelysuffer.Similarly,averyhighlevel,\nsuch as extreme anxiety, can be paralyzing and hinder performance. Consider the example of a softball\nteamfacingatournament.Theyarefavoredtowintheirfirstgamebyalargemargin,sotheygointothe\ngame with a lower level of arousal and get beat by a less skilled team.\nBut optimal arousal level is more complex than a simple answer that the middle level is always best.\nResearchers Robert Yerkes (pronounced \u201cYerk-EES\u201d) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal 334 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation\narousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed (Figure 10.7). This\nrelationship is known as Yerkes-Dodson law, which holds that a simple task is performed best when\narousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower.\nFigure 10.7 Task performance is best when arousal levels are in a middle range, with difficult tasks best performed\nunder lower levels of arousal and simple tasks best performed under higher levels of arousal.\nSelf-efficacy and Social Motives\nSelf-efficacy is an individual\u2019s belief in her own capability to complete a task, which may include\na previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task. Albert Bandura (1994) theorized\nthat an individual\u2019s sense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior. Bandura argues\nthat motivation derives from expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors, and\nultimately,itistheappreciationofourcapacitytoengageinagivenbehaviorthatwilldeterminewhatwe\ndoandthefuturegoalsthatwesetforourselves.Forexample,ifyouhaveasincerebeliefinyourability\nto achieve at the highest level, you are more likely to take on challenging tasks and to not let setbacks\ndissuade you from seeing the task through to the end.\nA number of theorists have focused their research on understanding social motives (McAdams &\nConstantian, 1983; McClelland & Liberman, 1949; Murray et al., 1938). Among the motives they describe\nare needs for achievement, affiliation, and intimacy. It is the need for achievement that drives\naccomplishment and performance. The need for affiliation encourages positive interactions with others,\nand the need for intimacy causes us to seek deep, meaningful relationships. Henry Murray et al. (1938)\ncategorizedtheseneedsintodomains.Forexample,theneedforachievementandrecognitionfallsunder\nthedomainofambition.Dominanceandaggressionwererecognizedasneedsunderthedomainofhuman\npower, and play was a recognized need in the domain of interpersonal affection.\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\nWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives, individual\ncharacteristics, or social contexts, Abraham Maslow (1943) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the\nspectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social. These needs are often\ndepicted as a pyramid (Figure 10.8).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation 335\nFigure 10.8 Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is illustrated here. In some versions of the pyramid, cognitive and aesthetic\nneeds are also included between esteem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the top of the pyramid\nfor self-transcendence.\nAt the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for survival. These are\nfollowed by basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense of belonging,\nand the need to have self-worth and confidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which\nisaneedthatessentiallyequatestoachievingone\u2019sfullpotential,anditcanonlyberealizedwhenneeds\nlower on the pyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the\nhumanisticemphasisonpositiveaspectsofhumannature.Maslowsuggestedthatthisisanongoing,life-\nlongprocessandthatonlyasmallpercentageofpeopleactuallyachieveaself-actualizedstate(Francis&\nKritsonis, 2006; Maslow, 1943).\nAccordingtoMaslow(1943),onemustsatisfylower-levelneedsbeforeaddressingthoseneedsthatoccur\nhigherinthepyramid.So,forexample,ifsomeoneisstrugglingtofindenoughfoodtomeethisnutritional\nrequirements, it is quite unlikely that he would spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about\nwhether others viewed him as a good person or not.

For example, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a\npolitical statement or in an attempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K. Gandhi, a world-\nrenowned advocate for independence through nonviolent protest, on several occasions went on hunger\nstrikes to protest a particular situation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in\ndanger displaying higher-level motives beyond their own needs. 336 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCheck out thisinteractive exercise (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hierneeds)that\nillustrates some of the important concepts in Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs.\n10.2 Hunger and Eating\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe how hunger and eating are regulated\n\u2022 Differentiate between levels of overweight and obesity and the associated health\nconsequences\n\u2022 Explain the health consequences resulting from anorexia and bulimia nervosa\nEatingisessentialforsurvival,anditisnosurprisethatadrivelikehungerexiststoensurethatweseek\nout sustenance. While this chapter will focus primarily on the physiological mechanisms that regulate\nhunger and eating, powerful social, cultural, and economic influences also play important roles. This\nsection will explain the regulation of hunger, eating, and body weight, and we will discuss the adverse\nconsequences of disordered eating.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS\nThere are a number of physiological mechanisms that serve as the basis for hunger. When our stomachs\nare empty, they contract, causing both hunger pangs and the secretion of chemical messages that travel\nto the brain to serve as a signal to initiate feeding behavior. When our blood glucose levels drop, the\npancreasandlivergenerateanumberofchemicalsignalsthatinducehunger(Kontureketal.,2003;Novin,\nRobinson, Culbreth, & Tordoff, 1985) and thus initiate feeding behavior.\nFor most people, once they have eaten, they feel satiation, or fullness and satisfaction, and their eating\nbehavior stops. Like the initiation of eating, satiation is also regulated by several physiological\nmechanisms.Asbloodglucoselevelsincrease,thepancreasandliversendsignalstoshutoffhungerand\neating (Drazen & Woods, 2003; Druce, Small, & Bloom, 2004; Greary, 1990). The food\u2019s passage through\nthe gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain (Woods, 2004), and fat cells\nreleaseleptin, a satiety hormone.\nThe various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the\nbrain. Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important\nsiteswherethisintegrationoccurs(Ahima&Antwi,2008;Woods&D\u2019Alessio,2008).Ultimately,activity\nin the brain determines whether or not we engage in feeding behavior (Figure 10.9).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation 337\nFigure 10.9 Hunger and eating are regulated by a complex interplay of hunger and satiety signals that are\nintegrated in the brain.\nMETABOLISM AND BODY WEIGHT\nOur body weight is affected by a number of factors, including gene-environment interactions, and the\nnumberofcaloriesweconsumeversusthenumberofcaloriesweburnindailyactivity.Ifourcaloricintake\nexceeds our caloric use, our bodies store excess energy in the form of fat.

For\nexample, there are no changes in metabolic rate between individuals who had recently lost significant\namounts of weight and a control group (Weinsier et al., 2000). In addition, the set-point theory fails to\naccount for the influence of social and environmental factors in the regulation of body weight (Martin-\nGronert & Ozanne, 2013; Speakman et al., 2011). Despite these limitations, set-point theory is still often\nused as a simple, intuitive explanation of how body weight is regulated.\nOBESITY\nWhen someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height, they are\nconsidered overweightorobese.According totheCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention(CDC),an 338 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation\nadult with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight (Figure 10.10).

Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight\nindicatorbytheWorldHealthOrganization(WHO),theCDC,andothergroups,itsvalueasanassessment\ntool has been questioned.

As you\u2019ve learned, the hypothalamus plays an important role in motivated\nbehaviors, and sex is no exception. In fact, lesions to an area of the hypothalamus called the medial\npreoptic area completely disrupt a male rat\u2019s ability to engage in sexual behavior.

Damage to these areas results in a decreased motivation to\nengageinsexualbehavior,whileleavingtheabilitytodosointact(Figure 10.15)(Everett,1990).Similar\ndissociations of sexual motivation and sexual ability have also been observed in the female rat (Becker,\nRudick, & Jenkins, 2001; Jenkins & Becker, 2001).\nFigure 10.15 The medial preoptic area, an area of the hypothalamus, is involved in the ability to engage in sexual\nbehavior, but it does not affect sexual motivation. In contrast, the amygdala and nucleus accumbens are involved in\nmotivation for sexual behavior, but they do not affect the ability to engage in it.\nAlthough human sexual behavior is much more complex than that seen in rats, some parallels between\nanimals and humans can be drawn from this research.

While the majority of people identify as heterosexual, there is a sizable\npopulation of people within the United States who identify as either homosexual or bisexual. Research\nsuggests that somewhere between 3% and 10% of the population identifies as homosexual (Kinsey,\nPomeroy, & Martin, 1948; LeVay, 1996; Pillard & Bailey, 1995).\nFigure 10.18 Between 3% and 10% of the adult population identifies as homosexual. (credit: Till Krech)\nIssues of sexual orientation have long fascinated scientists interested in determining what causes one\nindividual to be heterosexual while another is homosexual. For many years, people believed that these\ndifferences arose because of different socialization and familial experiences. However, research has\nconsistently demonstrated that the family backgrounds and experiences are very similar among\nheterosexuals and homosexuals (Bell, Weinberg, & Hammersmith, 1981; Ross & Arrindell, 1988).\nGenetic and biological mechanisms have also been proposed, and the balance of research evidence\nsuggests that sexual orientation has an underlying biological component. For instance, over the past\n25 years, research has demonstrated gene-level contributions to sexual orientation (Bailey & Pillard,\n1991; Hamer, Hu, Magnuson, Hu, & Pattatucci, 1993; Rodriguez-Larralde & Paradisi, 2009), with some\nresearchers estimating that genes account for at least half of the variability seen in human sexual\norientation (Pillard & Bailey, 1998). Other studies report differences in brain structure and function\nbetween heterosexuals and homosexuals (Allen & Gorski, 1992; Byne et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2008; LeVay,\n1991;Ponsetietal.,2006;Rahman&Wilson,2003a;Swaab&Hofman,1990),andevendifferencesinbasic\nbodystructureandfunctionhavebeenobserved(Hall&Kimura,1994;Lippa,2003;Loehlin&McFadden,\n2003;McFadden&Champlin,2000;McFadden&Pasanen,1998;Rahman&Wilson,2003b).Inaggregate,\nthe data suggest that to a significant extent, sexual orientations are something with which we are born.\nMisunderstandings about Sexual Orientation\nRegardless of how sexual orientation is determined, research has made clear that sexual orientation is\nnot a choice, but rather it is a relatively stable characteristic of a person that cannot be changed.

Together, these are known as the components of emotion. These appraisals are informed\nbyourexperiences,backgrounds,andcultures.Therefore,differentpeoplemayhavedifferentemotional\nexperiencesevenwhenfacedwithsimilarcircumstances.Overtime,severaldifferenttheoriesofemotion,\nshown in Figure 10.21, have been proposed to explain how the various components of emotion interact\nwith one another.\nThe James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal. Recall what\nyouhavelearnedaboutthesympatheticnervoussystemandourfightorflightresponsewhenthreatened.\nIfyouweretoencountersomethreatinyourenvironment,likeavenomoussnakeinyourbackyard,your\nsympathetic nervous system would initiate significant physiological arousal, which would make your\nheartraceandincreaseyourrespirationrate.AccordingtotheJames-Langetheoryofemotion,youwould\nonly experience a feeling of fear after this physiological arousal had taken place. Furthermore, different\narousal patterns would be associated with different feelings.\nOther theorists, however, doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of\nemotionsisdistinctenoughtoresultinthewidevarietyofemotionsthatweexperience.Thus,theCannon-\nBard theory of emotion was developed. According to this view, physiological arousal and emotional\nexperienceoccursimultaneously,yetindependently(Lang,1994).So,whenyouseethevenomoussnake,\nyou feel fear at exactly the same time that your body mounts its fight or flight response. This emotional\nreaction would be separate and independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur.\nThe James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories have each garnered some empirical support in various\nresearch paradigms. For instance, Chwalisz, Diener, and Gallagher (1988) conducted a study of the\nemotional experiences of people who had spinal cord injuries. They reported that individuals who were\nincapable of receiving autonomic feedback because of their injuries still experienced emotion; however,\nthere was a tendency for people with less awareness of autonomic arousal to experience less intense\nemotions.Morerecently,researchinvestigatingthefacialfeedbackhypothesissuggestedthatsuppression\nof facial expression of emotion lowered the intensity of some emotions experienced by participants\n(Davis, Senghas, & Ochsner, 2009). In both of these examples, neither theory is fully supported because\nphysiological arousal does not seem to be necessary for the emotional experience, but this arousal does\nappear to be involved in enhancing the intensity of the emotional experience.\nThe Schachter-Singer two-factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that\ntakes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience. According to this theory,\nemotionsarecomposedoftwofactors:physiologicalandcognitive.Inotherwords,physiologicalarousal\nis interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience. In revisiting our example involving the\nvenomous snake in your backyard, the two-factor theory maintains that the snake elicits sympathetic\nnervous system activation that is labeled as fear given the context, and our experience is that of fear. 352 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation\nFigure 10.21 This figure illustrates the major assertions of the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer\ntwo-factor theories of emotion. (credit \"snake\": modification of work by \"tableatny\"/Flickr; credit \"face\": modification of\nwork by Cory Zanker)\nIt is important to point out that Schachter and Singer believed that physiological arousal is very similar\nacross the different types of emotions that we experience, and therefore, the cognitive appraisal of the\nsituationiscriticaltotheactualemotionexperienced.Infact,itmightbepossibletomisattributearousalto\nan emotional experience if the circumstances were right (Schachter & Singer, 1962).\nTotesttheiridea,SchachterandSingerperformedacleverexperiment.Maleparticipantswererandomly\nassignedtooneofseveralgroups.Someoftheparticipantsreceivedinjectionsofepinephrinethatcaused\nbodily changes that mimicked the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system; however,\nonlysomeofthesemenweretoldtoexpectthesereactionsassideeffectsoftheinjection.Theothermen\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation 353\nthat received injections of epinephrine were told either that the injection would have no side effects or\nthatitwouldresultinasideeffectunrelatedtoasympatheticresponse,suchasitchingfeetorheadache.\nAfterreceivingtheseinjections,participantswaitedinaroomwithsomeoneelsetheythoughtwasanother\nsubject in the research project. In reality, the other person was a confederate of the researcher. The\nconfederate engaged in scripted displays of euphoric or angry behavior (Schachter & Singer, 1962).\nWhen those subjects who were told that they should expect to feel symptoms of physiological arousal\nwere asked about any emotional changes that they had experienced related to either euphoria or anger\n(depending on how their confederate behaved), they reported none. However, the men who weren\u2019t\nexpecting physiological arousal as a function of the injection were more likely to report that they\nexperiencedeuphoriaorangerasafunctionoftheirassignedconfederate\u2019sbehavior.Whileeveryonethat\nreceivedaninjectionofepinephrineexperiencedthesamephysiologicalarousal,onlythosewhowerenot\nexpecting the arousal used context to interpret the arousal as a change in emotional state (Schachter &\nSinger, 1962).\nStrongemotionalresponsesareassociatedwithstrongphysiologicalarousal.Thishasledsometosuggest\nthatthesignsofphysiologicalarousal,whichincludeincreasedheartrate,respirationrate,andsweating,\nmightserveasatooltodeterminewhethersomeoneistellingthetruthornot.Theassumptionisthatmost\nofuswouldshowsignsofphysiologicalarousalifwewerebeingdishonestwithsomeone.Apolygraph,\norliedetectortest,measuresthephysiologicalarousalofanindividualrespondingtoaseriesofquestions.\nSomeone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with\nincreased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those\nanswers. While polygraphs are still commonly used, their validity and accuracy are highly questionable\nbecause there is no evidence that lying is associated with any particular pattern of physiological arousal\n(Saxe & Ben-Shakhar, 1999).\nThe relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them, and the\norder in which these occur, remains a topic of research and debate. Lazarus (1991) developed the\ncognitive-mediational theorythatassertsouremotionsaredeterminedbyourappraisalofthestimulus.\nThisappraisalmediatesbetweenthestimulusandtheemotionalresponse,anditisimmediateandoften\nunconscious.IncontrasttotheSchachter-Singermodel,theappraisalprecedesacognitivelabel.Youwill\nlearn more about Lazarus\u2019s appraisal concept when you study stress, health, and lifestyle.\nTwo other prominent views arise from the work of Robert Zajonc and Joseph LeDoux.

The basolateral complex has dense connections with a\nvariety of sensory areas of the brain. It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional\nvalue to learning processes and memory. The central nucleus plays a role in attention, and it has\nconnections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and\nendocrine systems\u2019 activity (Pessoa, 2010).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation 355\nFigure 10.23 The anatomy of the basolateral complex and central nucleus of the amygdala are illustrated in this\ndiagram.\nAnimalresearchhasdemonstratedthatthereisincreasedactivationoftheamygdalainratpupsthathave\nodor cues paired with electrical shock when their mother is absent. This leads to an aversion to the odor\ncue that suggests the rats learned to fear the odor cue.

It has also been suggested that functional differences in the amygdala could serve as a\nbiomarker to differentiate individuals suffering from bipolar disorder from those suffering from major\ndepressive disorder (Fournier, Keener, Almeida, Kronhaus, & Phillips, 2013).\nHippocampus\nAs mentioned earlier, the hippocampus is also involved in emotional processing. Like the amygdala, 356 Chapter 10 | Emotion and Motivation\nresearch has demonstrated that hippocampal structure and function are linked to a variety of mood\nand anxiety disorders. Individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show marked\nreductionsinthevolumeofseveralpartsofthehippocampus,whichmayresultfromdecreasedlevelsof\nneurogenesisanddendriticbranching(thegenerationofnewneuronsandthegenerationofnewdendrites\nin existing neurons, respectively) (Wang et al., 2010). While it is impossible to make a causal claim with\ncorrelational research like this, studies have demonstrated behavioral improvements and hippocampal\nvolume increases following either pharmacological or cognitive-behavioral therapy in individuals\nsuffering from PTSD (Bremner & Vermetten, 2004; Levy-Gigi, Szab\u00f3, Kelemen, & K\u00e9ri, 2013).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/traumaticexp)about research that\ndemonstrates how the volume of the hippocampus can vary as a function of\ntraumatic experiences.\nFACIAL EXPRESSION AND RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONS\nCulturecanimpactthewayinwhichpeopledisplayemotion.Aculturaldisplayruleisoneofacollection\nof culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are\nacceptable (Malatesta & Haviland, 1982).

The word personality comes from the Latin word persona. In the ancient world, a\npersona was a mask worn by an actor. While we tend to think of a mask as being worn to conceal one\u2019s\nidentity,thetheatricalmaskwasoriginallyusedtoeitherrepresentorprojectaspecificpersonalitytraitof\na character (Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Happy, sad, impatient, shy, fearful, curious, helpful. What characteristics describe your personality?\nHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\nThe concept of personality has been studied for at least 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates in 370\nBCE (Fazeli, 2012). Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four\nseparatetemperamentsassociatedwithfourfluids(\u201chumors\u201d)ofthebody:cholerictemperament(yellow\nbile from the liver), melancholic temperament (black bile from the kidneys), sanguine temperament (red\nblood from the heart), and phlegmatic temperament (white phlegm from the lungs) (Clark & Watson,\n2008; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985; Lecci & Magnavita, 2013; Noga, 2007). Centuries later, the influential\nGreekphysician andphilosopher GalenbuiltonHippocrates\u2019s theory,suggesting thatbothdiseases and\npersonality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits\none of the four temperaments. For example, the choleric person is passionate, ambitious, and bold; the\nmelancholicpersonisreserved,anxious,andunhappy;thesanguinepersonisjoyful,eager,andoptimistic;\nand the phlegmatic person is calm, reliable, and thoughtful (Clark & Watson, 2008; Stelmack & Stalikas,\n1991).Galen\u2019stheorywasprevalentforover1,000yearsandcontinuedtobepopularthroughtheMiddle\nAges.\nIn 1780,FranzGall,aGerman physician, proposed thatthedistances between bumps on theskull reveal\na person\u2019s personality traits, character, and mental abilities (Figure 11.3). According to Gall, measuring\nthesedistancesrevealedthesizesofthebrainareasunderneath,providinginformationthatcouldbeused\ntodeterminewhetherapersonwasfriendly,prideful,murderous,kind,goodwithlanguages,andsoon.\nInitially,phrenologywasverypopular;however,itwassoondiscreditedforlackofempiricalsupportand\nhas long been relegated to the status of pseudoscience (Fancher, 1979).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 11 | Personality 367\nFigure 11.3 The pseudoscience of measuring the areas of a person\u2019s skull is known as phrenology. (a) Gall\ndeveloped a chart that depicted which areas of the skull corresponded to particular personality traits or characteristics\n(Hothersall, 1995). (b) An 1825 lithograph depicts Gall examining the skull of a young woman. (credit b: modification\nof work by Wellcome Library, London)\nIn the centuries after Galen, other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary\ntemperament types, most prominently Immanuel Kant (in the 18th century) and psychologist Wilhelm\nWundt(inthe19thcentury)(Eysenck,2009;Stelmack&Stalikas,1991;Wundt,1874/1886)(Figure 11.4).\nKant agreed with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there\nwas no overlap between the four categories (Eysenck, 2009). He developed a list of traits that could\nbe used to describe the personality of a person from each of the four temperaments. However, Wundt\nsuggested that a better description of personality could be achieved using two major axes: emotional/\nnonemotional and changeable/unchangeable. The first axis separated strong from weak emotions (the\nmelancholic and choleric temperaments from the phlegmatic and sanguine). The second axis divided\nthe changeable temperaments (choleric and sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic and\nphlegmatic) (Eysenck, 2009). 368 Chapter 11 | Personality\nFigure 11.4 Developed from Galen\u2019s theory of the four temperaments, Kant proposed trait words to describe each\ntemperament. Wundt later suggested the arrangement of the traits on two major axes.\nSigmund Freud\u2019s psychodynamic perspective of personality was the first comprehensive theory of\npersonality, explaining a wide variety of both normal and abnormal behaviors. According to Freud,\nunconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression, along with childhood sexuality, are the forces\nthat influence our personality.

However, Freud was the\nfirst to systematically study and theorize the workings of the unconscious mind in the manner that we\nassociate with modern psychology.\nIn the early years of his career, Freud worked with Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician. During this time,\nFreudbecameintriguedbythestoryofoneofBreuer\u2019spatients,BerthaPappenheim,whowasreferredto\nbythepseudonymAnnaO.(Launer,2005).AnnaO.hadbeencaringforherdyingfatherwhenshebegan\ntoexperiencesymptomssuchaspartialparalysis,headaches,blurredvision,amnesia,andhallucinations\n(Launer, 2005). In Freud\u2019s day, these symptoms were commonly referred to as hysteria. Anna O. turned\nto Breuer for help. He spent 2 years (1880\u20131882) treating Anna O. and discovered that allowing her to\ntalkaboutherexperiencesseemedtobringsomereliefofhersymptoms.AnnaO.calledhistreatmentthe\n\u201ctalkingcure\u201d(Launer,2005).DespitethefacttheFreudnevermetAnnaO.,herstoryservedasthebasis\nfor the 1895 book, Studies on Hysteria, which he co-authored with Breuer. Based on Breuer\u2019s description\nof Anna O.\u2019s treatment, Freud concluded that hysteria was the result of sexual abuse in childhood and\nthatthesetraumaticexperienceshadbeenhiddenfromconsciousness.BreuerdisagreedwithFreud,which\nsoon ended their work together. However, Freud continued to work to refine talk therapy and build his\ntheory on personality.\nLEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience, Freud compared the mind to an\niceberg(Figure11.5).Hesaidthatonlyaboutone-tenthofourmindisconscious,andtherestofourmind\nis unconscious. Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable\nto access (Freud, 1923). According to Freud, unacceptable urges and desires are kept in our unconscious\nthroughaprocesscalledrepression.Forexample,wesometimessaythingsthatwedon\u2019tintendtosayby\nunintentionallysubstitutinganotherwordfortheonewemeant.You\u2019veprobablyheardofaFreudianslip,\nthe term used to describe this. Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are actually sexual or aggressive\nurges,accidentally slipping outofourunconscious. Speech errors such asthisarequitecommon. Seeing\nthem as a reflection of unconscious desires, linguists today have found that slips of the tongue tend to\noccur when we are tired, nervous, or not at our optimal level of cognitive functioning (Motley, 2002). 370 Chapter 11 | Personality\nFigure 11.5 Freud believed that we are only aware of a small amount of our mind\u2019s activities and that most of it\nremains hidden from us in our unconscious. The information in our unconscious affects our behavior, although we are\nunaware of it.\nAccordingtoFreud,ourpersonalitydevelopsfromaconflictbetweentwoforces:ourbiologicalaggressive\nand pleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives. Our personality is\nthe result of our efforts to balance these two competing forces. Freud suggested that we can understand\nthis by imagining three interacting systems within our minds. He called them the id, ego, and superego\n(Figure 11.6).\nFigure 11.6 The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with the moral\ncontrol of the superego.\nThe unconscious id contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth. It directs\nimpulses for hunger, thirst, and sex. Freud believed that the id operates on what he called the \u201cpleasure\nprinciple,\u201d in which the id seeks immediate gratification. Through social interactions with parents and\nothers in a child\u2019s environment, the ego and superego develop to help control the id.

It helps satisfy the id\u2019s desires in a rational way that will not lead us to\nfeelings of guilt. According to Freud, a person who has a strong ego, which can balance the demands of\nthe id and the superego, has a healthy personality. Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can\nleadtoneurosis(atendencytoexperiencenegativeemotions),anxietydisorders,orunhealthybehaviors.\nForexample,apersonwhoisdominatedbytheiridmightbenarcissisticandimpulsive.Apersonwitha\ndominantsuperegomightbecontrolledbyfeelingsofguiltanddenythemselvesevensociallyacceptable\npleasures;conversely,ifthesuperegoisweakorabsent,apersonmightbecomeapsychopath.Anoverly\ndominant superego might be seen in an over-controlled individual whose rational grasp on reality is so\nstrongthattheyareunawareoftheiremotionalneeds,or,inaneuroticwhoisoverlydefensive(overusing\nego defense mechanisms).\nDEFENSE MECHANISMS\nFreud believed that feelings of anxiety result from the ego\u2019s inability to mediate the conflict between\nthe id and superego. When this happens, Freud believed that the ego seeks to restore balance through\nvariousprotectivemeasuresknownasdefensemechanisms(Figure 11.7).Whencertainevents,feelings,\nor yearnings cause an individual anxiety, the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety. To do that, the\nindividual\u2019sunconsciousmindusesegodefensemechanisms,unconsciousprotectivebehaviorsthataim\nto reduce anxiety.

This\nway, Joe\u2019s unconscious impulses are further submerged.\nThere are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing\nmemories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let\u2019s say your car is making a strange noise,\nbut because you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer\nhearthestrangenoise.Eventuallyyouforgetaboutit.Similarly,inthehumanpsyche,ifamemoryistoo\noverwhelming to deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud,\n1920). This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas.\nAnother defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and\nbehaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while\nhimself being attracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For\nexample,afour-year-oldchildwhoresentsthearrivalofanewbornsiblingmayactlikeababyandrevert\nto drinking out of a bottle.

He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during\nchildhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper\nnurturing and parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.\nIn each psychosexual stage of development, the child\u2019s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are\nfocusedonadifferentareaofthebody,calledanerogenouszone.Thestagesareoral,anal,phallic,latency,\nand genital (Table 11.1).\nFreud\u2019spsychosexualdevelopmenttheoryisquitecontroversial.Tounderstandtheoriginsofthetheory,\nit is helpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud\u2019s day in Vienna\nat the turn of the 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited\nunderstanding and education surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud\u2019s perspective.\nGiven that sex was a taboo topic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed\nfrom suppression of unconscious sexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and\ninterpretations of patients\u2019 experiences and dreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were\nuniversal events in early childhood. 374 Chapter 11 | Personality\nTable 11.1Freud\u2019s Stages of Psychosexual Development\nAge Erogenous Adult Fixation\nStage Major Conflict\n(years) Zone Example\nOral 0\u20131 Mouth Weaning off breast or Smoking, overeating\nbottle\nAnal 1\u20133 Anus Toilet training Neatness, messiness\nPhallic 3\u20136 Genitals Oedipus/Electra complex Vanity, overambition\nLatency 6\u201312 None None None\nGenital 12+ Genitals None None\nOral Stage\nIntheoralstage(birthto1year),pleasureisfocusedonthemouth.Eatingandthepleasurederivedfrom\nsucking(nipples,pacifiers,andthumbs)playalargepartinababy\u2019sfirstyearoflife.Ataround1yearof\nage,babiesareweanedfromthebottleorbreast,andthisprocesscancreateconflictifnothandledproperly\nby caregivers.

The\nerogenous zone inthis stage is thegenitals. Conflict arises when thechild feels adesire for theopposite-\nsex parent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus\ncomplex, involving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival\nfor the mother\u2019s attention.

A girl desires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother\u2019s place.

People in this stage have mature sexual interests,\nwhich for Freud meant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the\nprevious stages, reaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.\nWhile most of Freud\u2019s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the\ncontributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large\npart of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of early childhood and takes place outside of our\nconscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss the concept of the inferiority complex\n\u2022 Discuss the core differences between Erikson\u2019s and Freud\u2019s views on personality\n\u2022 Discuss Jung\u2019s ideas of the collective unconscious and archetypes\n\u2022 Discuss the work of Karen Horney, including her revision of Freud\u2019s \u201cpenis envy\u201d\nFreud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality.

Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did,\nAdlerfocusedonsocialmotives.Healsoemphasizedconsciousratherthanunconsciousmotivation,since\nhe believed that the three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued.

Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over,\nsuchasfacingdeath,becomingindependent,andstrivingformastery.Jung(1964)believedthatthrough\nbiology, each person is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols\u2014such as the\nhero, the maiden, the sage, and the trickster\u2014are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture.\nIn Jung\u2019s view, the task of integrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-\nrealizationprocessinthesecondhalfoflife.Withthisorientationtowardself-realization,Jungpartedways\nwith Freud\u2019s belief that personality is determined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic\nmovement with its emphasis on self-actualization and orientation toward the future.\nJung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923)\n(Table 11.3).

Jung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of\ngenetics since that time. We\u2019ve found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability\nto acquire language. However, we\u2019ve also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded\nonthegenomeandthatbabiescannotdecodesymbolism,refutingtheideaofabiologicalbasistoarchetypes.\nRather than being seen as purely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly\nfromourexperiencesandarereflectionsoflinguisticorculturalcharacteristics(Young-Eisendrath,1995).Today,\nmost Jungian scholars believe that the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and\nenvironmental influences, with the differences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).\nKAREN HORNEY\nKaren Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great\nDepression, Horney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from 380 Chapter 11 | Personality\nFreud\u2019s teachings. Like Jung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization\nand that the goal of psychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early\nchildhood patterns of dysfunction. Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis\nenvy and are jealous of male biological features. According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely\nculturallybased,duetothegreaterprivilegesthatmalesoftenhave,meaningthatthedifferencesbetween\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s personalities are culturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that\nmen have womb envy, because they cannot give birth.\nHorney\u2019s theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can be\nblockedbybasicanxietystemmingfromneedsnotbeingmet,suchaschildhoodexperiencesofloneliness\nand/orisolation. How do children learntohandlethisanxiety? Horneysuggested threestyles ofcoping\n(Table 11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence.

In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F. Skinner,\na strict behaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the\nenduring, consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists.\nAsyoumayrecallfromyourstudyonthepsychologyoflearning,Skinnerproposedthatwedemonstrate\nconsistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953).\nIn other words, we learn to behave in particular ways. We increase the behaviors that lead to positive\nconsequences,andwedecreasethebehaviorsthatleadtonegativeconsequences.Skinnerdisagreedwith\nFreud\u2019sideathatpersonalityisfixedinchildhood.Hearguedthatpersonalitydevelopsoverourentirelife,\nnotonlyinthefirstfewyears.Ourresponsescanchangeaswecomeacrossnewsituations;therefore,we\ncan expect more variability over time in personality than Freud would anticipate. For example, consider\na young woman, Greta, a risk taker. She drives fast and participates in dangerous sports such as hang\ngliding and kiteboarding. But after she gets married and has children, the system of reinforcements and\npunishments in her environment changes. Speeding and extreme sports are no longer reinforced, so she\nno longer engages in those behaviors. In fact, Greta now describes herself as a cautious person.\nTHE SOCIAL-COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE\nAlbertBanduraagreedwithSkinnerthatpersonalitydevelopsthroughlearning.Hedisagreed,however,\nwith Skinner\u2019s strict behaviorist approach to personality development, because he felt that thinking and\nreasoning are important components of learning. He presented a social-cognitive theory of personality\nthatemphasizesbothlearningandcognitionassourcesofindividualdifferencesinpersonality.Insocial-\ncognitivetheory,theconceptsofreciprocaldeterminism,observationallearning,andself-efficacyallplay\na part in personality development.\nReciprocal Determinism\nIn contrast to Skinner\u2019s idea that the environment alone determines behavior, Bandura (1990) proposed\nthe concept of reciprocal determinism, in which cognitive processes, behavior, and context all interact,\neach factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously (Figure 11.10). Cognitive\nprocesses refer to all characteristics previously learned, including beliefs, expectations, and personality\ncharacteristics. Behavior refers to anything that we do that may be rewarded or punished. Finally, the\ncontext in which the behavior occurs refers to the environment or situation, which includes rewarding/\npunishing stimuli. 382 Chapter 11 | Personality\nFigure 11.10 Bandura proposed the idea of reciprocal determinism: Our behavior, cognitive processes, and\nsituational context all influence each other.\nConsider,forexample,thatyou\u2019reatafestivalandoneoftheattractionsisbungeejumpingfromabridge.\nDo you do it? In this example, the behavior is bungee jumping. Cognitive factors that might influence\nthis behavior include your beliefs and values, and your past experiences with similar behaviors. Finally,\ncontext refers to the reward structure for the behavior. According to reciprocal determinism, all of these\nfactors are in play.\nObservational Learning\nBandura\u2019s key contribution to learning theory was the idea that much learning is vicarious. We learn by\nobserving someone else\u2019s behavior and its consequences, which Bandura called observational learning.\nHefeltthatthistypeoflearningalsoplaysapartinthedevelopmentofourpersonality.Justaswelearn\nindividual behaviors, we learn new behavior patterns when we see them performed by other people or\nmodels. Drawing on the behaviorists\u2019 ideas about reinforcement, Bandura suggested that whether we\nchoose to imitate a model\u2019s behavior depends on whether we see the model reinforced or punished.\nThrough observational learning, we come to learn what behaviors are acceptable and rewarded in our\nculture,andwealsolearntoinhibitdeviantorsociallyunacceptablebehaviorsbyseeingwhatbehaviors\nare punished.\nWe can see the principles of reciprocal determinism at work in observational learning. For example,\npersonal factors determine which behaviors in the environment a person chooses to imitate, and those\nenvironmental events in turn are processed cognitively according to other personal factors.\nSelf-Efficacy\nBandura (1977, 1995) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and\npersonality development, and most recently has focused on the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is\nourlevelofconfidenceinourownabilities,developedthroughoursocialexperiences.Self-efficacyaffects\nhowweapproachchallengesandreachgoals.Inobservational learning,self-efficacyisacognitivefactor\nthat affects which behaviors we choose to imitate as well as our success in performing those behaviors.\nPeople who have high self-efficacy believe that their goals are within reach, have a positive view of\nchallengesseeingthemastaskstobemastered,developadeepinterestinandstrongcommitmenttothe\nactivitiesinwhichtheyareinvolved,andquicklyrecoverfromsetbacks.Conversely,peoplewithlowself-\nefficacyavoidchallengingtasksbecausetheydoubttheirabilitytobesuccessful,tendtofocusonfailure\nand negative outcomes, and lose confidence in their abilities if they experience setbacks.

Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities,\nlocus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives.

Researchers have found that people with an internal locus of control perform better\nacademically, achieve more in their careers, are more independent, are healthier, are better able to cope,\nand are less depressed than people who have an external locus of control (Benassi, Sweeney, & Durfour,\n1988; Lefcourt, 1982; Maltby, Day, & Macaskill, 2007; Whyte, 1977, 1978, 1980).\nFigure 11.11 Locus of control occurs on a continuum from internal to external.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTake theLocus of Control (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/locuscontrol)\nquestionnaire.

When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to\ndelay gratification.

Reactivity refers to how we\nrespond to new or challenging environmental stimuli; self-regulation refers to our ability to control that\nresponse(Rothbart&Derryberry,1981;Rothbart,Sheese,Rueda,&Posner,2011).Forexample,oneperson\nmay immediately respond to new stimuli with a high level of anxiety, while another barely notices it.\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\nBody Type and Temperament\nIs there an association between your body type and your temperament? The constitutional perspective, which\nexaminestherelationshipbetweenthestructureofthehumanbodyandbehavior,seekstoanswerthisquestion\n(Genovese, 2008). The first comprehensive system of constitutional psychology was proposed by American\npsychologistWilliamH.Sheldon(1940,1942).Hebelievedthatyourbodytypecanbelinkedtoyourpersonality.\nSheldon\u2019s life\u2019s work was spent observing human bodies and temperaments. Based on his observations and\ninterviews of hundreds of people, he proposed three body/personality types, which he called somatotypes.\nThe three somatotypes are ectomorphs, endomorphs, and mesomorphs (Figure 11.12). Ectomorphs are thin\nwith a small bone structure and very little fat on their bodies. According to Sheldon, the ectomorph personality\nis anxious, self-conscious, artistic, thoughtful, quiet, and private. They enjoy intellectual stimulation and feel\nuncomfortable in social situations. Actors Adrien Brody and Nicole Kidman would be characterized as\nectomorphs. Endomorphs are the opposite of ectomorphs. Endomorphs have narrow shoulders and wide hips,\nand carry extra fat on their round bodies. Sheldon described endomorphs as being relaxed, comfortable, good-\nhumored, even-tempered, sociable, and tolerant. Endomorphs enjoy affection and detest disapproval. Queen\nLatifah and Jack Black would be considered endomorphs. The third somatotype is the mesomorph. This body\ntype falls between the ectomorph and the endomorph. Mesomorphs have large bone structure, well-defined\nmuscles,broadshoulders,narrowwaists,andattractive,strongbodies.AccordingtoSheldon,mesomorphsare\nadventurous,assertive,competitive,andfearless.Theyarecuriousandenjoytryingnewthings,butcanalsobe\nobnoxious and aggressive.

Do you think\nSheldon\u2019s ideas about somatotypes are generally accurate about most people?\nSheldon (1949) also conducted further research into somatotypes and criminality. He measured the physical\nproportions of hundreds of juvenile delinquent boys in comparison to male college students, and found that\nproblemyouthwereprimarilymesomorphs.Whymightthisbe?Perhapsit\u2019sbecausetheyarequicktoangerand\ndon\u2019t have the restraint demonstrated by ectomorphs. Maybe it\u2019s because a person with a mesomorphic body\ntype reflects high levels of testosterone, which may lead to more aggressive behavior. Can you think of other\nexplanations for Sheldon\u2019s findings?\nSheldon\u2019s method of somatotyping is not without criticism, as it has been considered largely subjective (Carter\n& Heath, 1990; Cort\u00e9s & Gatti, 1972; Parnell, 1958). More systematic and controlled research methods did\nnot support his findings (Eysenck, 1970). Consequently, it\u2019s not uncommon to see his theory labeled as\npseudoscience, much like Gall\u2019s theory of phrenology (Rafter, 2007; Rosenbaum, 1995). However, studies\ninvolving correlations between somatotype, temperament, and children\u2019s school performance (Sanford et al.,\n1943; Parnell); somatotype and performance of pilots during wartime (Damon, 1955); and somatotype and\ntemperament (Peterson, Liivamagi, & Koskel, 2006) did support his theory.\n11.7 Trait Theorists\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss early trait theories of Cattell and Eysenck\n\u2022 Discuss the Big Five factors and describe someone who is high and low on each of the five\ntraits\nTrait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits,\norcharacteristicwaysofbehaving.Doyoutendtobesociableorshy?Passiveoraggressive?Optimisticor\npessimistic?Moodyoreven-tempered?Earlytraittheoriststriedtodescribeallhumanpersonalitytraits. 388 Chapter 11 | Personality\nForexample,onetraittheorist,GordonAllport(Allport&Odbert,1936),found4,500wordsintheEnglish\nlanguage that could describe people.

The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck &\nEysenck, 1963) viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion\nand neuroticism/stability.\nFigure 11.13 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits are influenced by our genetic inheritance.\n(credit: \"Sirswindon\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nAccordingtotheirtheory,peoplehighonthetraitofextroversionaresociableandoutgoing,andreadily\nconnect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone,\nengage in solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others.

A helpful way to remember the traits is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.\nIn the Five Factor Model, each person has each trait, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to\nexperienceischaracterizedbyimagination,feelings,actions,andideas.Peoplewhoscorehighonthistrait\ntendtobecuriousandhaveawiderangeofinterests.Conscientiousnessischaracterizedbycompetence,\nself-discipline,thoughtfulness,andachievement-striving(goal-directedbehavior).Peoplewhoscorehigh\non this trait are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation\nbetween conscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham,\n2008; Conrad & Patry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is\ncharacterized by sociability, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who\nscore high on this trait are usually described as outgoing and warm.

Additionally, The Big Five traits have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures,\nand ages, and may have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996;\nJang et al., 2006; McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007). 392 Chapter 11 | Personality\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo find out about your personality and where you fall on the Big Five traits, follow this\nlink (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/big5)to take the Big Five personality test.\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section you should be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss personality differences of people from collectivist and individualist cultures\n\u2022 Discuss the three approaches to studying personality in a cultural context\nAsyouhavelearnedinthischapter,personalityisshapedbybothgeneticandenvironmentalfactors.The\ncultureinwhichyouliveisoneofthemostimportantenvironmentalfactorsthatshapesyourpersonality\n(Triandis & Suh, 2002).

In fact, there is evidence that\nthe strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the Big Five factors\n(conscientiousness,neuroticism,openness,andextroversion)acrosscultures.Asyouwilllearnwhenyou\nstudy social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be\nless extroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to\nexperience, whereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun,\n2003).\nAccording to this study, there also seem to be regional personality differences within the United States\n(Figure11.16).Researchersanalyzedresponsesfromover1.5millionindividualsintheUnitedStatesand\nfoundthattherearethreedistinctregionalpersonalityclusters:Cluster1,whichisintheUpperMidwest\nandDeepSouth,isdominatedbypeoplewhofallintothe\u201cfriendlyandconventional\u201dpersonality;Cluster\n2,whichincludestheWest,isdominatedbypeoplewhoaremorerelaxed,emotionallystable,calm,and\ncreative; and Cluster 3, which includes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed, irritable, and\ndepressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open (Rentfrow et al., 2013).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 11 | Personality 393\nFigure 11.16 Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States. People tend to be\nfriendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the\nWest; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).\nOne explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective\nmigrationistheconceptthatpeoplechoosetomovetoplacesthatarecompatiblewiththeirpersonalities\nand needs. For example, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and\nfriends, and would choose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness\nwould prefer to settle in a place that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California).\nPERSONALITY IN INDIVIDUALIST AND COLLECTIVIST CULTURES\nIndividualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who\nlive in individualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement\nare important. Individuals in Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score\nhigh on individualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in collectivist cultures\nvalue social harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in\ncountries in Asia, Africa, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995).\nThese values influence personality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures\ndisplayed more personally oriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed\nmore socially oriented personality traits. 394 Chapter 11 | Personality\nAPPROACHES TO STUDYING PERSONALITY IN A CULTURAL CONTEXT\nThere are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-\ncomparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements of\nbothviews.SinceideasaboutpersonalityhaveaWesternbasis,thecultural-comparativeapproachseeks\nto test Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized\nand if they have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011).

Personality testing is often used for this purpose\u2014to screen applicants for employment\nand job training. Personality tests are also used in criminal cases and custody battles, and to assess\npsychological disorders. This section explores the best known among the many different types of\npersonality tests.\nSELF-REPORT INVENTORIES\nSelf-reportinventoriesareakindofobjectivetestusedtoassesspersonality.Theytypicallyusemultiple-\nchoiceitemsornumberedscales,whichrepresentarangefrom1(stronglydisagree)to5(stronglyagree).\nThey often are called Likert scales after their developer, Rensis Likert (1932) (Figure 11.17).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 11 | Personality 395\nFigure 11.17 If you\u2019ve ever taken a survey, you are probably familiar with Likert-type scale questions. Most\npersonality inventories employ these types of response scales.\nOneofthemostwidelyusedpersonalityinventoriesistheMinnesotaMultiphasicPersonalityInventory\n(MMPI),firstpublishedin1943,with504true/falsequestions,andupdatedtotheMMPI-2in1989,with\n567 questions. The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota\nfarmers and psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national\nsampletoallowforbetterstandardization.TheMMPI-2takes1\u20132hourstocomplete.Responsesarescored\nto produce a clinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic\ndeviance(socialdeviance),masculinityversusfemininity,paranoia,psychasthenia(obsessive/compulsive\nqualities),schizophrenia,hypomania,andsocialintroversion.Thereisalsoascaletoascertainriskfactors\nfor alcohol abuse.

This kind of test relies on one of\nthe defense mechanisms proposed by Freud\u2014projection\u2014as a way to assess unconscious processes.\nDuring this type of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is\nencouragedtoprojecthisfeelings,impulses,anddesiresontothecards\u2014bytellingastory,interpretingan\nimage, or completing a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for\nexample,Exner,2002)andcanbeusedtoaccesswhethersomeonehasunusualthoughtsorahighlevelof\nanxiety, or is likely to become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test,\nthe Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS\n(Tell-Me-A-Story), and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB).\nTheRorschach InkblotTestwasdevelopedin1921byaSwisspsychologist namedHermannRorschach\n(pronounced \u201cROAR-shock\u201d). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client\nby a psychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, \u201cWhat might this\nbe?\u201dWhatthetest-takerseesrevealsunconsciousfeelingsandstruggles(Piotrowski,1987;Weiner,2003).\nThe Rorschach has been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression,\npsychosis, and anxiety.\nAsecondprojectivetestistheThematicApperceptionTest(TAT),createdinthe1930sbyHenryMurray,\nan American psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan.

There are three forms of this\ntest for use with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests\ninclude 40incomplete sentences that people areasked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19).\nTheaveragetimeforcompletingthetestisapproximately20minutes,asresponsesareonly1\u20132wordsin\nlength.Thistestissimilartoawordassociationtest,andlikeothertypesofprojectivetests,itispresumed\nthatresponseswillrevealdesires,fears,andstruggles.TheRISBisusedinscreeningcollegestudentsfor\nadjustment problems and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 11 | Personality 397\nFigure 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete\nthese sentences?\nFor many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality\nassessments.However,itwasfoundthattestbiaslimitedtheirusefulness(Hoy-Watkins&Jenkins-Moore,\n2008). It is difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/\ncultural groups using personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins\n& Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the\nresultwasoftenshorterstorylengthandlowlevelsofculturalidentification(Duzant,2005).Therefore,it\nwasvitaltodevelopotherpersonalityassessmentsthatexploredfactorssuchasrace,language,andlevel\nofacculturation(Hoy-Watkins&Jenkins-Moore,2008).Toaddressthisneed,RobertWilliamsdeveloped\nthe first culturally specific projective test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African\nAmericans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).

More recent theories\nof personality have been proposed, including Freud\u2019s psychodynamic perspective, which holds that\npersonality is formed through early childhood experiences. Other perspectives then emerged in reaction\nto the psychodynamic perspective, including the learning, humanistic, biological, trait, and cultural\nperspectives.\n11.2Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective\nSigmundFreudpresentedthefirstcomprehensivetheoryofpersonality.Hewasalsothefirsttorecognize\nthat much of our mental life takes place outside of our conscious awareness.

In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone.\nFailure to resolve a stage can lead one to become fixated in that stage, leading to unhealthy personality\ntraits. Successful resolution of the stages leads to a healthy adult.\n11.3Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney\nThe neo-Freudians were psychologists whose work followed from Freud\u2019s. They generally agreed with\nFreud that childhood experiences matter, but they decreased the emphasis on sex and focused more on\nthesocialenvironmentandeffectsofcultureonpersonality.Someofthenotableneo-FreudiansareAlfred\nAdler, Carl Jung, Erik Erikson, and Karen Horney. The neo-Freudian approaches have been criticized,\nbecausetheytendtobephilosophicalratherthanbasedonsoundscientificresearch.Forexample,Jung\u2019s\nconclusions about the existence of the collective unconscious are based on myths, legends, dreams, and\nart.Inaddition,aswithFreud\u2019spsychoanalytictheory,theneo-Freudiansbasedmuchoftheirtheoriesof\npersonality on information from their patients.\n11.4Learning Approaches\nBehavioral theorists view personality as significantly shaped and impacted by the reinforcements and\nconsequences outside of the organism. People behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B.\nF. Skinner, a prominent behaviorist, said that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns, because we\nhavedevelopedcertainresponsetendencies.Mischelfocusedonhowpersonalgoalsplayaroleintheself-\nregulation process. Albert Bandura said that one\u2019s environment can determine behavior, but at the same\ntime, people can influence the environment with both their thoughts and behaviors, which is known as\nreciprocal determinism. Bandura also emphasized how we learn from watching others. He felt that this\ntypeoflearningalsoplaysapartinthedevelopmentofourpersonality.Banduradiscussedtheconceptof\nself-efficacy,whichisourlevelofconfidenceinourownabilities.Finally,Rotterproposedtheconceptof\nlocus of control, which refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives.

They believed that people strive to become self-actualized. Both Rogers\u2019s and Maslow\u2019s\ntheories greatly contributed to our understanding of the self. They emphasized free will and self-\ndetermination, with each individual desiring to become the best person they can become.\n11.6Biological Approaches\nSomeaspectsofourpersonalitiesarelargelycontrolledbygenetics;however,environmentalfactors(such\nas family interactions) and maturation can affect the ways in which children\u2019s personalities are expressed.\n11.7Trait Theorists\nTrait theorists attempt to explain our personality by identifying our stable characteristics and ways\nof behaving. They have identified important dimensions of personality. The Five Factor Model is the\nmost widely accepted trait theory today. The five factors are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion,\nagreeableness, and neuroticism. These traits occur along a continuum.\n11.8Cultural Understandings of Personality\nThe culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your\npersonality.

(credit:\nSgt. Derec Pierson, U.S. Army)\nSocial psychologists focus on how people construe or interpret situations and how these interpretations\ninfluence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Ross & Nisbett, 1991).

Subfields of psychology tend to focus\non one influence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are\ndetermined by our immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that\nour behavior is determined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a\nperson and includes personality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the\nsituationistperspective,whereaspersonalitypsychologistshavepromotedthedispositionistperspective.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 407\nModernapproachestosocialpsychology,however,takeboththesituationandtheindividualintoaccount\nwhen studying human behavior (Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality\npsychology has emerged to study the complex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect\nhuman behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).\nFUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR\nIntheUnitedStates,thepredominantculturetendstofavoradispositionalapproachinexplaininghuman\nbehavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors,\nand,therefore, anybehavior change must bedueto something internal,such astheirpersonality, habits,\nortemperament.Accordingtosomesocialpsychologists,peopletendtooveremphasizeinternalfactorsas\nexplanations\u2014orattributions\u2014forthebehaviorofotherpeople.Theytendtoassumethatthebehaviorof\nanotherpersonisatraitofthatperson,andtounderestimatethepowerofthesituationonthebehaviorof\nothers.Theytendtofailtorecognizewhenthebehaviorofanotherisduetosituationalvariables,andthus\nto the person\u2019s state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977;\nRiggio & Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Greg returns home from work, and\nuponopeningthefrontdoorhiswifehappilygreetshimandinquiresabouthisday.Insteadofgreetinghis\nwife,Gregyellsather,\u201cLeavemealone!\u201dWhydidGregyellathiswife?Howwouldsomeonecommitting\nthe fundamental attribution error explain Greg\u2019s behavior? The most common response is that Greg is a\nmean, angry, or unfriendly person (his traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,\nimaginethatGregwasjustlaidofffromhisjobduetocompanydownsizing.Wouldyourexplanationfor\nGreg\u2019sbehaviorchange?YourrevisedexplanationmightbethatGregwasfrustratedanddisappointedfor\nlosinghisjob;therefore,hewasinabadmood(hisstate).Thisisnowanexternalorsituationalexplanation\nfor Greg\u2019s behavior.\nThefundamentalattributionerrorissopowerfulthatpeopleoftenoverlookobvioussituationalinfluences\non behavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster\nstudy (Ross, Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role\nofaquestioner(thequizmaster)oracontestantinaquizgame.Questionersdevelopeddifficultquestions\nto which they knew the answers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants\nansweredthequestionscorrectlyonly4outof10times(Figure 12.3).Afterthetask,thequestionersand\ncontestantswereaskedtoratetheirowngeneralknowledgecomparedtotheaveragestudent.Questioners\ndidnotratetheirgeneralknowledgehigherthanthecontestants,butthecontestantsratedthequestioners\u2019\nintelligencehigherthantheirown.Inasecondstudy,observersoftheinteractionalsoratedthequestioner\nas having more general knowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the\nsituation. The questioners wrote the questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants\nandobserversmadeaninternalattributionfortheperformance.Theyconcludedthatthequestionersmust\nbe more intelligent than the contestants.\nFigure 12.3 In the quizmaster study, people tended to disregard the influence of the situation and wrongly\nconcluded that a questioner\u2019s knowledge was greater than their own. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)\nAs demonstrated in the example above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful\ninfluence in how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers 408 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\nhavesuggestedthatthefundamentalattributionerrormaynotbeaspowerfulasitisoftenportrayed.In\nfact, a recent review of more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of\nidiosyncrasyofthecharacterandhowwellhypotheticaleventsareexplained)playaroleindetermining\njust how influential the fundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).\nIS THE FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON?\nYou may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in\nall cultures commit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from\nan individualistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have\nthe greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend\nto be found in western countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote\na focus on the individual. Therefore, a person\u2019s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for\nherbehavior.Incontrast,peoplefromacollectivisticculture,thatis,aculturethatfocusesoncommunal\nrelationshipswithothers,suchasfamily,friends,andcommunity(Figure 12.4),arelesslikelytocommit\nthe fundamental attribution error (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).\nFigure 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize\nrelationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual. Activities such as (a) preparing a meal, (b) hanging\nout, and (c) playing a game engage people in a group.

This focus on others provides a broader perspective that takes into\naccount both situational and cultural influences on behavior; thus, a more nuanced explanation of the\ncauses of others\u2019 behavior becomes more likely.

So\na na\u00efve observer would tend to attribute Greg\u2019s hostile behavior to Greg\u2019s disposition rather than to the\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 409\ntrue,situationalcause.Whydoyouthinkweunderestimatetheinfluenceofthesituationonthebehaviors\nof others? One reason is that we often don\u2019t have all the information we need to make a situational\nexplanationforanotherperson\u2019sbehavior.Theonlyinformationwemighthaveiswhatisobservable.Due\ntothislackofinformationwehaveatendencytoassumethebehaviorisduetoadispositional,orinternal,\nfactor. When it comes to explaining our own behaviors, however, we have much more information\navailable to us. If you came home from school or work angry and yelled at your dog or a loved one,\nwhat would your explanation be? You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed\nquiet time\u2014a situational explanation. The actor-observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other\npeople\u2019s behavior to internal factors (fundamental attribution error) while attributing our own behavior\nto situational forces (Jones & Nisbett, 1971; Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek, 1973; Choi & Nisbett,\n1998).Asactorsofbehavior,wehavemoreinformationavailabletoexplainourownbehavior.Howeveras\nobservers,wehavelessinformationavailable;therefore,wetendtodefaulttoadispositionistperspective.\nOne study on the actor-observer bias investigated reasons male participants gave for why they liked\ntheirgirlfriend(Nisbettetal.,1973).Whenaskedwhyparticipantslikedtheirowngirlfriend,participants\nfocusedoninternal,dispositionalqualitiesoftheirgirlfriends(forexample,herpleasantpersonality).The\nparticipants\u2019 explanations rarely included causes internal to themselves, such as dispositional traits (for\nexample, \u201cI need companionship.\u201d). In contrast, when speculating why amale friend likes his girlfriend,\nparticipantswereequallylikelytogivedispositionalandexternalexplanations.Thissupportstheideathat\nactorstendtoprovidefewinternalexplanationsbutmanysituationalexplanationsfortheirownbehavior.\nIn contrast, observers tend to provide more dispositional explanations for a friend\u2019s behavior (Figure\n12.5).\nFigure 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versus their\nimpressions of others\u2019 reasons for liking a girlfriend.\nSELF-SERVING BIAS\nFollowinganoutcome,self-servingbiasarethoseattributionsthatenableustoseeourselvesinfavorable\nlight (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When\nyou do well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional\nattribution for your behavior (\u201cI\u2019m smart,\u201d) instead of a situational one (\u201cThe exam was easy,\u201d). The 410 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\ntendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive\noutcomesbutsituationalorexternalattributionsfornegativeoutcomesisknownastheself-servingbias\n(Miller&Ross,1975).Thisbiasservestoprotectself-esteem.Youcanimaginethatifpeoplealwaysmade\nsituationalattributionsfortheirbehavior,theywouldneverbeabletotakecreditandfeelgoodabouttheir\naccomplishments.\nWe can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause\nof a result. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus\nexternal),stability(stableversusunstable),andcontrollability(controllableversusuncontrollable).Inthis\ncontext,stabilityreferstheextenttowhichthecircumstancesthatresultinagivenoutcomearechangeable.\nThecircumstancesareconsideredstableiftheyareunlikelytochange.Controllabilityreferstotheextent\nto which the circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those\nthings that we have the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979).\nConsider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team\u2019s wins. Research shows that we make\ninternal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team\u2019s victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanrahan, &\nMcInman, 1991). For example, we might tell ourselves that our team is talented (internal), consistently\nworks hard (stable), and uses effective strategies (controllable). In contrast, we are more likely to make\nexternal, unstable, and uncontrollable attributions when our favorite team loses. For example, we might\ntellourselvesthattheotherteamhasmoreexperiencedplayersorthattherefereeswereunfair(external),\nthe other team played at home (unstable), and the cold weather affected our team\u2019s performance\n(uncontrollable).\nFigure 12.6 We tend to believe that our team wins because it\u2019s better, but loses for reasons it cannot control\n(Roesch & Amirkham, 1997).

In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that\ngoodpeopleexperiencepositiveoutcomes,andbadpeopleexperiencenegativeoutcomes(Jost,Banaji,&\nNosek, 2004; Jost & Major, 2001). The ability to think of the world as a fair place, where people get what\nthey deserve, allows us to feel that the world is predictable and that we have some control over our life\noutcomes(Jostetal.,2004;Jost&Major,2001).Forexample,ifyouwanttoexperiencepositiveoutcomes,\nyou just need to work hard to get ahead in life.\nCan you think of a negative consequence of the just-world hypothesis?

We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology\u2019s emphasis on the\nways in which a person\u2019s environment, including culture and other social influences, affect behavior. In\nthis section, we examine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including\nsocial roles, social norms, and scripts. We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source\nof information, or cues, on how to behave. Situational influences on our behavior have important\nconsequences, such as whether we will help a stranger in an emergency or how we would behave in an\nunfamiliar environment.\nSOCIAL ROLES\nOnemajorsocialdeterminantofhumanbehaviorisoursocialroles.Asocialroleisapatternofbehavior\nthatisexpectedofapersoninagivensettingorgroup(Hare,2003).Eachoneofushasseveralsocialroles.\nYoumaybe,atthesametime,astudent,aparent,anaspiringteacher,asonordaughter,aspouse,anda\nlifeguard.Howdothesesocialrolesinfluenceyourbehavior?Socialrolesaredefinedbyculturallyshared\nknowledge.Thatis,nearlyeveryoneinagivencultureknowswhatbehaviorisexpectedofapersonina\ngivenrole.Forexample,whatisthesocialroleforastudent?Ifyoulookaroundacollegeclassroomyou\nwilllikelyseestudentsengaginginstudiousbehavior,takingnotes,listeningtotheprofessor,readingthe\ntextbook,andsittingquietlyattheirdesks(Figure 12.8).Ofcourseyoumayseestudentsdeviatingfrom 412 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\ntheexpectedstudiousbehaviorsuchastextingontheirphonesorusingFacebookontheirlaptops,butin\nall cases, the students that you observe are attending class\u2014a part of the social role of students.\nFigure 12.8 Being a student is just one of the many social roles you have.

In\nthe summer of 1971, an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers\nto participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life. More than 70 men volunteered,\nand these volunteers then underwent psychological testing to eliminate candidates who had underlying\npsychiatricissues,medicalissues,orahistoryofcrimeordrugabuse.Thepoolofvolunteerswaswhittled\ndownto24healthymalecollegestudents.Eachstudentwaspaid$15perdayandwasrandomlyassigned\ntoplaytheroleofeitheraprisoneroraguardinthestudy.Basedonwhatyouhavelearnedaboutresearch\nmethods, why is it important that participants were randomly assigned?\nA mock prison was constructed in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Participants\nassignedtoplaytheroleofprisonerswere\u201carrested\u201dattheirhomesbyPaloAltopoliceofficers,booked\nat a police station, and subsequently taken to the mock prison. The experiment was scheduled to run\nfor several weeks. To the surprise of the researchers, both the \u201cprisoners\u201d and \u201cguards\u201d assumed their\nroles with zeal. In fact, on day 2, some of the prisoners revolted, and the guards quelled the rebellion\nby threatening the prisoners with night sticks. In a relatively short time, the guards came to harass the\nprisoners in an increasingly sadistic manner, through a complete lack of privacy, lack of basic comforts\nsuch as mattresses to sleep on, and through degrading chores and late-night counts.\nTheprisoners,inturn,begantoshowsignsofsevereanxietyandhopelessness\u2014theybegantoleratingthe\nguards\u2019 abuse. Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher, Philip\nZimbardo, found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role, as prison supervisor, was real as\nwell.Afteronlysixdays,theexperimenthadtobeendedduetotheparticipants\u2019deterioratingbehavior.\nZimbardo explained,\nAtthispointitbecameclearthatwehadtoendthestudy.Wehadcreatedanoverwhelmingly 414 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\npowerful situation\u2014a situation in which prisoners were withdrawing and behaving in\npathological ways, and in which some of the guards were behaving sadistically.

When prisoners rebelled, they violated these social norms,\nwhich led to upheaval. The specific acts engaged by the guards and the prisoners derived from scripts.\nFor example, guards degraded the prisoners by forcing them do push-ups and by removing all privacy.\nPrisoners rebelled by throwing pillows and trashing their cells. Some prisoners became so immersed in\ntheirrolesthattheyexhibitedsymptomsofmentalbreakdown;however,accordingtoZimbardo,noneof\nthe participants suffered long term harm (Alexander, 2001).\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment has some parallels with the abuse of prisoners of war by U.S. Army\ntroops and CIA personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004. The offenses at Abu Ghraib were\ndocumented by photographs of the abuse, some taken by the abusers themselves (Figure 12.10).\nFigure 12.10 Iraqi prisoners of war were abused by their American captors in Abu Ghraib prison, during the second\nIraq war.

Attitude is our\nevaluation of a person, an idea, or an object. We have attitudes for many things ranging from products\nthat we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies. Typically,\nattitudes are favorable or unfavorable: positive or negative (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). And, they have\nthreecomponents:anaffectivecomponent(feelings),abehavioralcomponent(theeffectoftheattitudeon\nbehavior), and a cognitive component (belief and knowledge) (Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960).\nFor example, you may hold a positive attitude toward recycling. This attitude should result in positive\nfeelings toward recycling (such as \u201cIt makes me feel good to recycle\u201d or \u201cI enjoy knowing that I make\na small difference in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills\u201d). Certainly, this attitude\nshouldbereflectedinourbehavior:Youactuallyrecycleasoftenasyoucan.Finally,thisattitudewillbe\nreflectedinfavorablethoughts(forexample,\u201cRecyclingisgoodfortheenvironment\u201dor\u201cRecyclingisthe\nresponsible thing to do\u201d).\nOurattitudesandbeliefsarenotonlyinfluencedbyexternalforces,butalsobyinternalinfluencesthatwe\ncontrol. Like our behavior, our attitudes and thoughts are not always changed by situational pressures,\nbuttheycanbeconsciouslychangedbyourownfreewill.Inthissectionwediscusstheconditionsunder\nwhich we would want to change our own attitudes and beliefs.\nWHAT IS COGNITIVE DISSONANCE?\nSocial psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-\nesteem is a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris & Aronson, 2008). In the United States,\nmembers of the predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves\nas good people who are above average on many desirable traits (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, & Ross, 2005).\nOften, our behavior, attitudes, and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem\nor positive self-image. Psychologist Leon Festinger (1957)defined cognitive dissonance as psychological\ndiscomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes, behaviors, or cognitions (thoughts,\nbeliefs, or opinions). Festinger\u2019s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict\nin our behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self-perceptions, we experience\npsychologicaldiscomfort(dissonance).Forexample,ifyoubelievesmokingisbadforyourhealthbutyou\ncontinue to smoke, you experience conflict between your belief and behavior (Figure 12.11). 416 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\nFigure 12.11 Cognitive dissonance is aroused by inconsistent beliefs and behaviors. Believing cigarettes are bad for\nyour health, but smoking cigarettes anyway, can cause cognitive dissonance. To reduce cognitive dissonance,\nindividuals can change their behavior, as in quitting smoking, or change their belief, such as discounting the evidence\nthat smoking is harmful. (credit \u201ccigarettes\u201d: modification of work by CDC/Debora Cartagena; \u201cpatch\u201d: modification of\n\"RegBarc\"/Wikimedia Commons; \u201csmoking\u201d: modification of work by Tim Parkinson)\nLater research documented that only conflicting cognitions that threaten individuals\u2019 positive self-image\ncause dissonance (Greenwald & Ronis, 1978). Additional research found that dissonance is not only\npsychologically uncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal (Croyle & Cooper, 1983) and\nactivateregionsofthebrainimportantinemotionsandcognitivefunctioning(vanVeen,Krug,Schooler,\n& Carter, 2009). When we experience cognitive dissonance, we are motivated to decrease it because it is\npsychologically,physically,andmentallyuncomfortable.Wecanreducecognitivedissonancebybringing\nour cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors in line\u2014that is, making them harmonious. This can be done in\ndifferent ways, such as:\n\u2022 changing our discrepant behavior (e.g., stop smoking),\n\u2022 changing our cognitions through rationalization or denial (e.g., telling ourselves that health risks\ncan be reduced by smoking filtered cigarettes),\n\u2022 adding a new cognition (e.g., \u201cSmoking suppresses my appetite so I don\u2019t become overweight,\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 417\nwhich is good for my health.\u201d).\nA classic example of cognitive dissonance is John, a 20-year-old who enlists in the military. During boot\ncamp he is awakened at 5:00 a.m., is chronically sleep deprived, yelled at, covered in sand flea bites,\nphysicallybruisedandbattered,andmentallyexhausted(Figure12.12).Itgetsworse.Recruitsthatmake\nit to week 11 of boot camp have to do 54 hours of continuous training.\nFigure 12.12 A person who has chosen a difficult path must deal with cognitive dissonance in addition to many\nother discomforts. (credit: Tyler J. Bolken)\nNot surprisingly, John is miserable. No one likes to be miserable. In this type of situation, people can\nchange their beliefs, their attitudes, or their behaviors. The last option, a change of behaviors, is not\navailable to John. He has signed on to the military for four years, and he cannot legally leave.\nIf John keeps thinking about how miserable he is, it is going to be a very long four years. He will be in\na constant state of cognitive dissonance. As an alternative to this misery, John can change his beliefs or\nattitudes. He can tell himself, \u201cI am becoming stronger, healthier, and sharper. I am learning discipline\nand how to defend myself and my country. What I am doing is really important.\u201d If this is his belief, he\nwillrealizethatheisbecomingstrongerthroughhischallenges.Hethenwillfeelbetterandnotexperience\ncognitive dissonance, which is an uncomfortable state.\nThe Effect of Initiation\nThemilitaryexampledemonstratestheobservationthatadifficultinitiationintoagroupinfluencesusto\nlike the group more, due to the justification of effort. We do not want to have wasted time and effort to\njoin a group that we eventually leave. A classic experiment by Aronson and Mills (1959) demonstrated\nthis justification of effort effect. College students volunteered to join a campus group that would meet\nregularlytodiscussthepsychologyofsex.Participantswererandomlyassignedtooneofthreeconditions:\nno initiation, an easy initiation, and a difficult initiation into the group.

Students in the difficult initiation\ncondition liked the group more than students in other conditions due to the justification of effort.\nSimilar effects can be seen in a more recent study of how student effort affects course evaluations.\nHeckert,Latier,Ringwald-Burton,andDrazen(2006)surveyed463undergraduatesenrolledincoursesat\na midwestern university about the amount of effort that their courses required of them. In addition, the\nstudents were also asked to evaluate various aspects of the course.

Here is one: Marco and Maria live in Fairfield County, Connecticut, which is one of the\nwealthiest areas in the United States and has a very high cost of living. Marco telecommutes from home\nandMariadoesnotworkoutsideofthehome.Theyrentaverysmallhouseformorethan$3000amonth.\nMaria shops at consignment stores for clothes and economizes where she can. They complain that they\nnever have any money and that they cannot buy anything new. When asked why they do not move to a\nless expensive location, since Marco telecommutes, they respond that Fairfield County is beautiful, they\nlove the beaches, and they feel comfortable there. How does the theory of cognitive dissonance apply to\nMarco and Maria\u2019s choices?\nPERSUASION\nIn the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to\nchangeourattitudes,behaviors,and/orcognitionstomakethemconsonant.Persuasionistheprocessof\nchangingourattitudetowardsomethingbasedonsomekindofcommunication.Muchofthepersuasion\nweexperiencecomesfromoutsideforces.Howdopeopleconvinceotherstochangetheirattitudes,beliefs,\nand behaviors (Figure 12.14)?

After the war, Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University. Out of this\nworkcameamodelcalledtheYaleattitudechangeapproach,whichdescribestheconditionsunderwhich\npeople tend to change their attitudes. Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a\npersuasivemessage,thecontentofthemessage,andthecharacteristicsoftheaudiencewillinfluencethe\npersuasiveness of a message (Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953).\nFeaturesofthesourceofthepersuasivemessageincludethecredibilityofthespeaker(Hovland&Weiss,\n1951) and the physical attractiveness of the speaker (Eagly & Chaiken, 1975; Petty, Wegener, & Fabrigar,\n1997).Thus,speakerswhoarecredible,orhaveexpertiseonthetopic,andwhoaredeemedastrustworthy\nare more persuasive than less credible speakers. Similarly, more attractive speakers are more persuasive\nthan less attractive speakers. The use of famous actors and athletes to advertise products on television\nandinprintreliesonthisprinciple.Theimmediateandlongtermimpactofthepersuasionalsodepends,\nhowever, on the credibility of the messenger (Kumkale & Albarrac\u00edn, 2004).\nFeatures of the message itself that affect persuasion include subtlety (the quality of being important, but\nnot obvious) (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Walster & Festinger, 1962); sidedness (that is, having more than\none side) (Crowley & Hoyer, 1994; Igou & Bless, 2003; Lumsdaine & Janis, 1953); timing (Haugtvedt &\nWegener,1994;Miller&Campbell, 1959),andwhetherbothsides arepresented.Messages thataremore\nsubtlearemorepersuasivethandirectmessages.Argumentsthatoccurfirst,suchasinadebate,aremore\ninfluential if messages are given back-to-back. However, if there is a delay after the first message, and\nbeforetheaudienceneedstomakeadecision,thelastmessagepresentedwilltendtobemorepersuasive\n(Miller & Campbell, 1959).\nFeatures of the audience that affect persuasion are attention (Albarrac\u00edn & Wyer, 2001; Festinger &\nMaccoby, 1964), intelligence, self-esteem (Rhodes & Wood, 1992), and age (Krosnick & Alwin, 1989). In\norder to be persuaded, audience members must be paying attention. People with lower intelligence are\nmore easily persuaded than people with higher intelligence; whereas people with moderate self-esteem\naremoreeasilypersuadedthanpeoplewithhigherorlowerself-esteem(Rhodes&Wood,1992).Finally,\nyounger adults aged 18\u201325 are more persuadable than older adults. 420 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\nElaboration Likelihood Model\nAn especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration likelihood\nmodel of persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The elaboration likelihood model considers the variables\nof the attitude change approach\u2014that is, features of the source of the persuasive message, contents of\nthe message, and characteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur.\nAccordingtotheelaborationlikelihoodmodelofpersuasion,therearetwomainroutesthatplayarolein\ndelivering a persuasive message: central and peripheral (Figure 12.15).\nFigure 12.15 Persuasion can take one of two paths, and the durability of the end result depends on the path.\nThecentralrouteislogicdrivenandusesdataandfactstoconvincepeopleofanargument\u2019sworthiness.\nFor example, a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car\u2019s\nsafety features and fuel economy.

The topics of conformity,\nsocial influence, obedience, and group processes demonstrate thepower of thesocial situation to change\nour thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We begin this section with a discussion of a famous social 422 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\npsychology experiment that demonstrated how susceptible humans are to outside social pressures.\nCONFORMITY\nSolomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the\nthoughtsandbehaviorsofotherpeople.Inonestudy,agroupofparticipantswasshownaseriesofprinted\nline segments of different lengths: a, b, and c (Figure 12.17). Participants were then shown a fourth line\nsegment: x. They were asked to identify which line segment from the first group (a, b, or c) most closely\nresembled the fourth line segment in length.\nFigure 12.17 These line segments illustrate the judgment task in Asch\u2019s conformity study. Which line on the\nright\u2014a, b, or c\u2014is the same length as line x on the left?\nEach group of participants had only one true, na\u00efve subject. The remaining members of the group were\nconfederates of the researcher. A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works\nfor the researcher. Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design,\nand the true, na\u00efve participants believe that confederates are, like them, uninformed participants in the\nexperiment.InAsch\u2019sstudy,theconfederatesidentifiedalinesegmentthatwasobviouslyshorterthanthe\ntarget line\u2014a wrong answer.

Research shows that the size of the\nmajority,thepresenceofanotherdissenter,andthepublicorrelativelyprivatenatureofresponsesarekey\ninfluences on conformity.\n\u2022 The size of the majority: The greater the number of people in the majority, the more likely an\nindividual will conform. There is, however, an upper limit: a point where adding more members\ndoes not increase conformity. In Asch\u2019s study, conformity increased with the number of people\nin the majority\u2014up to seven individuals. At numbers beyond seven, conformity leveled off and\ndecreased slightly (Asch, 1955).\n\u2022 The presence of another dissenter: If there is at least one dissenter, conformity rates drop to near\nzero (Asch, 1955).\n\u2022 Thepublicorprivatenatureoftheresponses:Whenresponsesaremadepublicly(infrontofothers),\nconformity is more likely; however, when responses are made privately (e.g., writing down the\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 423\nresponse), conformity is less likely (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).\nThefindingthatconformityismorelikelytooccurwhenresponsesarepublicthanwhentheyareprivate\nisthereasongovernmentelectionsrequirevotinginsecret,sowearenotcoercedbyothers(Figure12.18).\nTheAscheffectcanbeeasilyseeninchildrenwhentheyhavetopubliclyvoteforsomething.Forexample,\nif the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess, no homework, or candy, once a\nfew children vote, the rest will comply and go with the majority.

Compliance can be a form\nof conformity. Compliance is going along with a request or demand, even if you do not agree with the\nrequest. In Asch\u2019s studies, the participants complied by giving the wrong answers, but privately did not\naccept that the obvious wrong answers were correct.\nFigure 12.18 Voting for government officials in the United States is private to reduce the pressure of conformity.\n(credit: Nicole Klauss)\nNow that you have learned about the Asch line experiments, why do you think the participants\nconformed? The correct answer to the line segment question was obvious, and it was an easy task.\nResearchers have categorized the motivation to conform into two types: normative social influence and\ninformational social influence (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).\nInnormativesocialinfluence,peopleconformtothegroupnormtofitin,tofeelgood,andtobeaccepted\nby the group.

These factors include\ntheparticipant\u2019sage,gender,andsocio-culturalbackground(Bond&Smith,1996;Larsen,1990;Walker&\nAndrade, 1996).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Asch2)to see a replication of the\nAsch experiment.\nSTANLEY MILGRAM\u2019S EXPERIMENT\nConformity is one effect of the influence of others on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Another\nform of social influence is obedience to authority. Obedience is the change of an individual\u2019s behavior\nto comply with a demand by an authority figure. People often comply with the request because they\nare concerned about a consequence if they do not comply. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we review\nanother classic social psychology experiment.\nStanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf\nEichmann,aNaziwarcriminal.Eichmann\u2019sdefensefortheatrocitieshecommittedwasthathewas\u201cjust\nfollowingorders.\u201dMilgram(1963)wantedtotestthevalidityofthisdefense,sohedesignedanexperiment\nandinitiallyrecruited40menforhisexperiment.Thevolunteerparticipantswereledtobelievethatthey\nwereparticipatinginastudytoimprovelearningandmemory.Theparticipantsweretoldthattheywere\nto teach other students (learners) correct answers to a series of test items. The participants were shown\nhow to use a device that they were told delivered electric shocks of different intensities to the learners.\nThe participants were told to shock the learners if they gave a wrong answer to a test item\u2014that the\nshockwouldhelpthemtolearn.Theparticipantsgave(orbelievedtheygave)thelearnersshocks,which\nincreasedin15-voltincrements,allthewayupto450volts.Theparticipantsdidnotknowthatthelearners\nwere confederates and that the confederates did not actually receive shocks.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 425\nInresponsetoastringofincorrectanswersfromthelearners,theparticipantsobedientlyandrepeatedly\nshocked them. The confederate learners cried out for help, begged the participant teachers to stop, and\neven complained of heart trouble. Yet, when the researcher told the participant-teachers to continue\nthe shock, 65% of the participants continued the shock to the maximum voltage and to the point that\nthe learner became unresponsive (Figure 12.20). What makes someone obey authority to the point of\npotentially causing serious harm to another person?\nFigure 12.20 The Milgram experiment showed the surprising degree to which people obey authority. Two out of\nthree (65%) participants continued to administer shocks to an unresponsive learner.\nSeveralvariationsoftheoriginalMilgramexperimentwereconductedtotesttheboundariesofobedience.\nWhen certain features of the situation were changed, participants were less likely to continue to deliver\nshocks(Milgram,1965).Forexample,whenthesettingoftheexperimentwasmovedtoanofficebuilding,\nthepercentageofparticipantswhodeliveredthehighestshockdroppedto48%.Whenthelearnerwasin\nthe same room as the teacher, the highest shock rate dropped to 40%. When the teachers\u2019 and learners\u2019\nhands were touching, the highest shock rate dropped to 30%. When the researcher gave the orders by\nphone, the rate dropped to 23%. These variations show that when the humanity of the person being\nshockedwasincreased,obediencedecreased.Similarly,whentheauthorityoftheexperimenterdecreased,\nso did obedience.\nThis case is still very applicable today. What does a person do if an authority figure orders something\ndone?Whatifthepersonbelievesitisincorrect,orworse,unethical?InastudybyMartinandBull(2008),\nmidwives privately filled out a questionnaire regarding best practices and expectations in delivering a\nbaby. Then, a more senior midwife and supervisor asked the junior midwives to do something they had\npreviously stated they were opposed to. Most of the junior midwives were obedient to authority, going\nagainst their own beliefs.\nGROUPTHINK\nWhen in group settings, we are often influenced by the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors around us.\nWhether it is due to normative or informational social influence, groups have power to influence\nindividuals. Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink. Groupthink is the modification\nof the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus (Janis,\n1972). In group situations, the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the\ngroup setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do. Moreover, groupthink 426 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\ncanhinderopposingtrainsofthought.Thiseliminationofdiverseopinionscontributestofaultydecision\nby the group.\nDIG DEEPER\nGroupthink in the U.S. Government\nThere have been several instances of groupthink in the U.S. government. One example occurred when the\nUnited States led a small coalition of nations to invade Iraq in March 2003. This invasion occurred because\na small group of advisors and former President George W. Bush were convinced that Iraq represented a\nsignificantterrorismthreatwithalargestockpileofweaponsofmassdestructionatitsdisposal.Althoughsome\noftheseindividualsmayhavehadsomedoubtsaboutthecredibilityoftheinformationavailabletothematthe\ntime,intheend,thegrouparrivedataconsensusthatIraqhadweaponsofmassdestructionandrepresented\nasignificantthreattonationalsecurity.ItlatercametolightthatIraqdidnothaveweaponsofmassdestruction,\nbutnotuntiltheinvasionwaswellunderway.Asaresult,6000Americansoldierswerekilledandmanymore\ncivilians died.

When\nthegroupishighlycohesive,orhasastrongsenseofconnection,maintaininggroupharmonymaybecome\nmoreimportanttothegroupthanmakingsounddecisions.Ifthegroupleaderisdirectiveandmakeshis\nopinions known, this may discourage group members from disagreeing with the leader. If the group is\nisolatedfromhearingalternativeornewviewpoints,groupthinkmaybemorelikely.Howdoyouknow\nwhen groupthink is occurring?\nThere are several symptoms of groupthink including the following:\n\u2022 perceiving the group as invulnerable or invincible\u2014believing it can do no wrong\n\u2022 believing the group is morally correct\n\u2022 self-censorshipbygroupmembers,suchaswithholdinginformationtoavoiddisruptingthegroup\nconsensus\n\u2022 the quashing of dissenting group members\u2019 opinions\n\u2022 the shielding of the group leader from dissenting views\n\u2022 perceiving an illusion of unanimity among group members\n\u2022 holdingstereotypesornegativeattitudestowardtheout-grouporothers\u2019withdifferingviewpoints\n(Janis, 1972)\nGiventhecausesandsymptomsofgroupthink,howcanitbeavoided?Thereareseveralstrategiesthatcan\nimprove group decision making including seeking outside opinions, voting in private, having the leader\nwithholdpositionstatementsuntilallgroupmembershavevoicedtheirviews,conductingresearchonall\nviewpoints,weighingthecostsandbenefitsofalloptions,anddevelopingacontingencyplan(Janis,1972;\nMitchell & Eckstein, 2009).\nGROUP POLARIZATION\nAnotherphenomenonthatoccurswithingroupsettingsisgrouppolarization.Grouppolarization(Teger\n& Pruitt, 1967) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a\ngroup. That is, if a group initially favors a viewpoint, after discussion the group consensus is likely a\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 427\nstronger endorsement of the viewpoint. Conversely, if the group was initially opposed to a viewpoint,\ngroup discussion would likely lead to stronger opposition. Group polarization explains many actions\ntaken by groups that would not be undertaken by individuals. Group polarization can be observed at\npolitical conventions, when platforms of the party are supported by individuals who, when not in a\ngroup,woulddeclinetosupportthem.Amoreeverydayexampleisagroup\u2019sdiscussionofhowattractive\nsomeone is. Does your opinion change if you find someone attractive, but your friends do not agree? If\nyour friends vociferously agree, might you then find this person even more attractive?\nSocial Facilitation\nNot all intergroup interactions lead to the negative outcomes we have described. Sometimes being in a\ngroup situation can improve performance. Social facilitation occurs when anindividual performs better\nwhen an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone. This typically\noccurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled. Can you think of an example in\nwhichhavinganaudiencecouldimproveperformance?Onecommonexampleissports.Skilledbasketball\nplayers will be more likely to make a free throw basket when surrounded by a cheering audience than\nwhen playing alone in the gym (Figure 12.21). However, there are instances when even skilled athletes\ncan have difficulty under pressure. For example, if an athlete is less skilled or nervous about making a\nfreethrow,havinganaudiencemayactuallyhinderratherthanhelp.Insum,socialfacilitationislikelyto\noccurforeasytasks,ortasksatwhichweareskilled,butworseperformancemayoccurwhenperforming\nin front of others, depending on the task.\nFigure 12.21 The attention of the crowd can motivate a skilled athlete. (credit: Tommy Gilligan/USMA)\nSocial Loafing\nAnother way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social loafing. Social loafing is\nthe exertion of less effort by a person working together with a group. Social loafing occurs when our\nindividualperformancecannotbeevaluatedseparatelyfromthegroup.Thus,groupperformancedeclines\non easy tasks (Karau & Williams, 1993). Essentially individual group members loaf and let other group\nmemberspickuptheslack.Becauseeachindividual\u2019seffortscannotbeevaluated,individualsbecomeless\nmotivated to perform well. For example, consider a group of people cooperating to clean litter from the\nroadside.Somepeoplewillexertagreatamountofeffort,whileotherswillexertlittleeffort.Yettheentire\njob gets done, and it may not be obvious who worked hard and who didn\u2019t.\nAs a college student you may have experienced social loafing while working on a group project. Have\nyoueverhadtocontributemorethanyourfairsharebecauseyourfellowgroupmembersweren\u2019tputting\nin the work? This may happen when a professor assigns a group grade instead of individual grades. If 428 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\ntheprofessordoesn\u2019tknowhowmuchefforteachstudentcontributedtoaproject,somestudentsmaybe\ninclined to let more conscientious students do more of the work. The chance of social loafing in student\nwork groups increases as the size of the group increases (Shepperd & Taylor, 1999).\nInterestingly, the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult (Bond & Titus,\n1983;Geen,1989).Rememberthepreviousdiscussionofchokingunderpressure?Thishappenswhenyou\nperformadifficulttaskandyourindividualperformancecanbeevaluated.Inagroupsetting,suchasthe\nstudentworkgroup,ifyourindividualperformancecannotbeevaluated,thereislesspressureforyouto\ndowell,andthuslessanxietyorphysiologicalarousal(Latan\u00e9,Williams,&Harkens,1979).Thisputsyou\ninarelaxedstateinwhichyoucanperformyourbest,ifyouchoose(Zajonc,1965).Ifthetaskisadifficult\none,manypeoplefeelmotivatedandbelievethattheirgroupneedstheirinputtodowellonachallenging\nproject(Jackson&Williams,1985).Givenwhatyoulearnedaboutsocialloafing,whatadvicewouldyou\ngiveanewprofessorabouthowtodesigngroupprojects?Ifyousuggestedthatindividuals\u2019effortsshould\nnotbeevaluated,topreventtheanxietyofchokingunderpressure,butthatthetaskmustbechallenging,\nyou have a good understanding of the concepts discussed in this section. Alternatively, you can suggest\nthat individuals\u2019 efforts should be evaluated, but the task should be easy so as to facilitate performance.\nGood luck trying to convince your professor to only assign easy projects.\nTable 12.2summarizes the types of social influence you have learned about in this chapter.\nTable 12.2Types of Social Influence\nType of Social Influence Description\nConformity Changing your behavior to go along with the group even if you\ndo not agree with the group\nCompliance Going along with a request or demand\nNormative social influence Conformity to a group norm to fit in, feel good, and be accepted\nby the group\nInformational social influence Conformity to a group norm prompted by the belief that the\ngroup is competent and has the correct information\nObedience Changing your behavior to please an authority figure or to\navoid aversive consequences\nGroupthink Group members modify their opinions to match what they\nbelieve is the group consensus\nGroup polarization Strengthening of the original group attitude after discussing\nviews within a group\nSocial facilitation Improved performance when an audience is watching versus\nwhen the individual performs the behavior alone\nSocial loafing Exertion of less effort by a person working in a group because\nindividual performance cannot be evaluated separately from the\ngroup, thus causing performance decline on easy tasks\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 429\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define and distinguish among prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination\n\u2022 Provide examples of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination\n\u2022 Explain why prejudice and discrimination exist\nHumanconflictcanresultincrime,war,andmassmurder,suchasgenocide.Prejudiceanddiscrimination\noften are root causes of human conflict, which explains how strangers come to hate one another to the\nextreme of causing others harm. Prejudice and discrimination affect everyone.

Indeed, when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively\ninteractingwithsomeonefromadifferentgroup,thisledtoanincreasedpositiveattitudetowardtheother\ngroup and an increase in positive traits associated with the other group. Furthermore, imagined social\ninteraction can reduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions (Crisp & Turner, 2009).

For example, someone\nholdingprejudicedattitudestowardolderadults,maybelievethatolderadultsareslowandincompetent\n(Cuddy, Norton, & Fiske, 2005; Nelson, 2004). We cannot possibly know each individual person of\nadvanced age to know that all older adults are slow and incompetent. Therefore, this negative belief is\novergeneralizedtoallmembersofthegroup,eventhoughmanyoftheindividualgroupmembersmayin\nfact be spry and intelligent.\nAnotherexampleofawell-knownstereotypeinvolvesbeliefsaboutracialdifferencesamongathletes.As\nHodge,Burden,Robinson,andBennett(2008)pointout,Blackmaleathletesareoftenbelievedtobemore\nathletic,yetlessintelligent,thantheirWhitemalecounterparts.Thesebeliefspersistdespiteanumberof\nhigh profile examples to the contrary. Sadly, such beliefs often influence how these athletes are treated\nby others and how they view themselves and their own capabilities. Whether or not you agree with a\nstereotype, stereotypes are generally well-known within in a given culture (Devine, 1989).\nSometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people, and this behavior is\nknown as discrimination. Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one\u2019s\nmembership in a particular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004).

However, it is important to also point out\nthat people can hold positive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward individuals based on group\nmembership; for example, they would show preferential treatment for people who are like\nthemselves\u2014that is, who share the same gender, race, or favorite sports team.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 431\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/racismexp)demonstrates the concepts of\nprejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. In the video, a social experiment is\nconducted in a park where three people try to steal a bike out in the open. The race\nand gender of the thief is varied: a White male teenager, a Black male teenager, and\na White female. Does anyone try to stop them? The treatment of the teenagers in the\nvideo demonstrates the concept of racism.\nTYPES OF PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION\nWhen we meet strangers we automatically process three pieces of information about them: their race,\ngender, and age (Ito & Urland, 2003). Why are these aspects of an unfamiliar person so important? Why\ndon\u2019t we instead notice whether their eyes are friendly, whether they are smiling, their height, the type\nof clothes they are wearing? Although these secondary characteristics are important in forming a first\nimpression of a stranger, the social categories of race, gender, and age provide a wealth of information\nabout an individual. This information, however, often is based on stereotypes. We may have different\nexpectations of strangers depending on their race, gender, and age. What stereotypes and prejudices do\nyou hold about people who are from a race, gender, and age group different from your own?\nRacism\nRacism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one\u2019s membership in a\nspecific racial group (such as toward African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans,\nEuropean Americans). What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups? Research suggests\ncultural stereotypes for Asian Americans include cold, sly, and intelligent; for Latinos, cold and\nunintelligent; for European Americans, cold and intelligent; and for African Americans, aggressive,\nathletic, and more likely to be law breakers (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002;\nSommers & Ellsworth, 2000; Dixon & Linz, 2000).\nRacism exists for many racial and ethnic groups. For example, Blacks are significantly more likely to\nhave their vehicles searched during traffic stops than Whites, particularly when Blacks are driving in\npredominately White neighborhoods, (a phenomenon often termed \u201cDWB,\u201d or \u201cdriving while Black.\u201d)\n(Rojek, Rosenfeld, & Decker, 2012)\nMexicanAmericansandotherLatinogroupsalsoaretargetsofracismfromthepoliceandothermembers\nofthecommunity.Forexample,whenpurchasingitemswithapersonalcheck,Latinoshoppersaremore\nlikely than White shoppers to be asked to show formal identification (Dovidio et al., 2010).\nIn one case of alleged harassment by the police, several East Haven, Connecticut, police officers were\narrestedonfederalchargesduetoreportedlycontinuedharassmentandbrutalizationofLatinos.Whenthe\naccusationscameout,themayorofEastHavenwasasked,\u201cWhatareyoudoingfortheLatinocommunity\ntoday?\u201dTheMayorresponded,\u201cImighthavetacoswhenIgohome,I\u2019mnotquitesureyet\u201d(\u201cEastHaven\nMayor,\u201d 2012) This statement undermines the important issue of racial profiling and police harassment\nof Latinos, while belittling Latino culture by emphasizing an interest in a food product stereotypically\nassociated with Latinos.\nRacism is prevalent toward many other groups in the United States including Native Americans, Arab\nAmericans, Jewish Americans, and Asian Americans. Have you witnessed racism toward any of these\nracial or ethnic groups? Are you aware of racism in your community?\nOne reason modern forms of racism, and prejudice in general, are hard to detect is related to the dual\nattitudes model (Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000). Humans have two forms of attitudes: explicit 432 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\nattitudes, which are conscious and controllable, and implicit attitudes, which are unconscious and\nuncontrollable(Devine,1989;Olson&Fazio,2003).Becauseholdingegalitarianviewsissociallydesirable\n(Plant & Devine, 1998), most people do not show extreme racial bias or other prejudices on measures of\ntheir explicit attitudes. However, measures of implicit attitudes often show evidence of mild to strong\nracial bias or other prejudices (Greenwald, McGee, & Schwartz, 1998; Olson & Fazio, 2003).\nSexism\nSexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex. Typically, sexism takes\nthe form of men holding biases against women, but either sex can show sexism toward their own or\ntheir opposite sex. Like racism, sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect. Common forms of sexism\nin modern society include gender role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of\nthe household. Sexism also includes people\u2019s expectations for how members of a gender group should\nbehave. For example, women are expected to be friendly, passive, and nurturing, and when women\nbehaveinanunfriendly,assertive,orneglectfulmannertheyoftenaredislikedforviolatingtheirgender\nrole (Rudman, 1998). Research by Laurie Rudman (1998) finds that when female job applicants self-\npromote, they are likely to be viewed as competent, but they may be disliked and are less likely to be\nhiredbecausetheyviolatedgenderexpectations formodesty.

If certain types\nofprejudiceanddiscriminationareacceptableinasociety,theremaybenormativepressurestoconform\nand share those prejudiced beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.

When we hold stereotypes about a person, we tend to treat the person\naccordingtoourexpectations.Thistreatmentcaninfluencethepersontoactaccordingtoourstereotypic\nexpectations, thus confirming our stereotypic beliefs. Research by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) found\nthat disadvantaged students whose teachers expected them to perform well had higher grades than\ndisadvantaged students whose teachers expected them to do poorly.\nConsider this example of cause and effect in a self-fulfilling prophecy: If an employer expects an openly\ngay male job applicant to be incompetent, the potential employer might treat the applicant negatively\nduring the interview by engaging in less conversation, making little eye contact, and generally behaving\ncoldlytowardtheapplicant(Hebl,Foster,Mannix,&Dovidio,2002).Inturn,thejobapplicantwillperceive\nthat the potential employer dislikes him, and he will respond by giving shorter responses to interview\nquestions, making less eye contact, and generally disengaging from the interview. After the interview,\nthe employer will reflect on the applicant\u2019s behavior, which seemed cold and distant, and the employer\nwill conclude, based on the applicant\u2019s poor performance during the interview, that the applicant was\nin fact incompetent. Thus, the employer\u2019s stereotype\u2014gay men are incompetent and do not make good\nemployees\u2014is reinforced. Do you think this job applicant is likely to be hired? Treating individuals\naccording to stereotypic beliefs can lead to prejudice and discrimination.\nAnother dynamic that can reinforce stereotypes is confirmation bias. When interacting with the target of\nourprejudice,wetendtopayattentiontoinformationthatisconsistentwithourstereotypicexpectations\nandignoreinformationthatisinconsistentwithourexpectations.Inthisprocess,knownasconfirmation\nbias, we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent\nwithourstereotypes(Wason&Johnson-Laird,1972).Inthejobinterviewexample,theemployermaynot\nhavenoticedthatthejobapplicantwasfriendlyandengaging,andthatheprovidedcompetentresponses\nto the interview questions in the beginning of the interview. Instead, the employer focused on the job\napplicant\u2019s performance in the later part of the interview, after the applicant changed his demeanor and\nbehavior to match the interviewer\u2019s negative treatment.\nHave you ever fallen prey to the self-fulfilling prophecy or confirmation bias, either as the source or\ntarget of such bias? How might we stop the cycle of the self-fulfilling prophecy? Social class stereotypes\nof individuals tend to arise when information about the individual is ambiguous. If information is\nunambiguous, stereotypes do not tend to arise (Baron et al., 1995).\nIN-GROUPS AND OUT-GROUPS\nAs discussed previously in this section, we all belong to a gender, race, age, and social economic group.\nThese groups provide a powerful source of our identity and self-esteem (Tajfel & Turner, 1979).

For example, if you are female, your gender in-group includes all females, and your gender\nout-group includes all males (Figure 12.24). People often view gender groups as being fundamentally\ndifferent from each other in personality traits, characteristics, social roles, and interests. Because we\noften feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in-groups, we develop in-group\nbias: a preference for our own group over other groups. This in-group bias can result in prejudice and\ndiscrimination because the out-group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in-group.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 435\nFigure 12.24 These children are very young, but they are already aware of their gender in-group and out-group.\n(credit: modification of work by Simone Ramella)\nDespitethegroupdynamicsthatseemonlytopushgroupstowardconflict,thereareforcesthatpromote\nreconciliation between groups: the expression of empathy, of acknowledgment of past suffering on both\nsides, and the halt of destructive behaviors.\nOne function of prejudice is to help us feel good about ourselves and maintain a positive self-concept.\nThis need to feel good about ourselves extends to our in-groups: We want to feel good and protect\nour in-groups.

Aggression\ntakes two forms depending on one\u2019s motives: hostile or instrumental. Hostile aggression is motivated\nby feelings of anger with intent to cause pain; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile\naggression.Incontrast,instrumentalaggressionismotivatedbyachievingagoalanddoesnotnecessarily\ninvolveintenttocausepain(Berkowitz,1993);acontractkillerwhomurdersforhiredisplaysinstrumental\naggression.\nThere are many different theories as to why aggression exists. Some researchers argue that aggression\nserves an evolutionary function (Buss, 2004). Men are more likely than women to show aggression\n(Wilson & Daly, 1985). From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, human male aggression, like\nthat in nonhuman primates, likely serves to display dominance over other males, both to protect a mate 436 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\nand to perpetuate the male\u2019s genes (Figure 12.25). Sexual jealousy is part of male aggression; males\nendeavortomakesuretheirmatesarenotcopulatingwithothermales,thusensuringtheirownpaternity\nof the female\u2019s offspring.

Based on what you have learned about\nchild development and social roles, why do you think boys and girls display different types of bullying\nbehavior?\nBullying involves three parties: the bully, the victim, and witnesses or bystanders. The act of bullying\ninvolves an imbalance of power with the bully holding more power\u2014physically, emotionally, and/or\nsocially over the victim. The experience of bullying can be positive for the bully, who may enjoy a boost\nto self-esteem. However, there are several negative consequences of bullying for the victim, and also for\nthe bystanders. How do you think bullying negatively impacts adolescents? Being the victim of bullying\nis associated with decreased mental health, including experiencing anxiety and depression (APA, 2010).\nVictimsofbullyingmayunderperforminschoolwork(Bowen,2011).Bullyingalsocanresultinthevictim\ncommitting suicide (APA, 2010). How might bullying negatively affect witnesses?\nAlthough there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim\nofbullying(APA,2010),researchershaveidentifiedsomepatternsinchildrenwhoareatagreaterriskof\nbeing bullied (Olweus, 1993):\n\u2022 Children who are emotionally reactive are at a greater risk for being bullied.

Interestingly,\ngirls who become cyberbullies often have been the victims of cyberbullying at one time (Vandebosch &\nVan Cleemput, 2009).The effects of cyberbullying arejust as harmful as traditional bullying and include\nthe victim feeling frustration, anger, sadness, helplessness, powerlessness, and fear. Victims will also\nexperience lower self-esteem (Hoff & Mitchell, 2009; Spears et al., 2009). Furthermore, recent research\nsuggeststhatbothcyberbullyingvictimsandperpetratorsaremorelikelytoexperiencesuicidalideation,\nandtheyaremorelikelytoattemptsuicidethanindividualswhohavenoexperiencewithcyberbullying\n(Hinduja & Patchin, 2010). What features of technology make cyberbullying easier and perhaps more\naccessibletoyoungadults?Whatcanparents,teachers,andsocialnetworkingwebsites,likeFacebook,do\nto prevent cyberbullying?\nFigure 12.26 Because cyberbullying is not physical in nature, cyberbullies and their victims are most often female;\nhowever, there is much evidence that male homosexuals are frequently victims of cyberbullying as well (Hinduja &\nPatchin, 2011).

Instead, they just watch what is happening. Social psychologists hold that\nwe make these decisions based on the social situation, not our own personality variables.

Why do people help other people? Is personal benefit such as feeling good about oneself\nthe only reason people help one another? Research suggests there are many other reasons. Altruism is\npeople\u2019s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping. In fact, people acting\ninaltruistic ways may disregard thepersonal costs associated with helping(Figure 12.27).For example,\nnewsaccountsofthe9/11terroristattacksontheWorldTradeCenterinNewYorkreportedanemployee\nin the first tower helped his co-workers make it to the exit stairwell. After helping a co-worker to safety\nhewentbackintheburningbuildingtohelpadditionalco-workers.Inthiscasethecostsofhelpingwere\ngreat, and the hero lost his life in the destruction (Stewart, 2002).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 439\nFigure 12.27 The events of 9/11 unleashed an enormous show of altruism and heroism on the parts of first\nresponders and many ordinary people. (credit: Don Halasy)\nSome researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy. Empathy is the capacity to understand\nanother person\u2019s perspective, to feel what he or she feels. An empathetic person makes an emotional\nconnection with others and feels compelled to help (Batson, 1991). Other researchers argue that altruism\nis a form of selfless helping that is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself. Certainly,\nafter helping, people feel good about themselves, but some researchers argue that this is a consequence\nof altruism, not a cause. Other researchers argue that helping is always self-serving because our egos\nare involved, and we receive benefits from helping (Cialdini, Brown, Lewis, Luce, & Neuberg 1997). It is\nchallengingtodetermineexperimentallythetruemotivationforhelping,whetherisitlargelyself-serving\n(egoism) or selfless (altruism). Thus, a debate on whether pure altruism exists continues.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee this excerpt from the popular TV seriesFriends episode\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/friendsclip)for a discussion of the egoism versus\naltruism debate.\nFORMING RELATIONSHIPS\nWhat do you think is the single most influential factor in determining with whom you become friends\nand whom you form romantic relationships?

Homophily is the tendency for people to form social\nnetworks,includingfriendships,marriage,businessrelationships,andmanyothertypesofrelationships,\nwith others who are similar (McPherson et al., 2001).\nFigure 12.28 People tend to be attracted to similar people. Many couples share a cultural background. This can be\nquite obvious in a ceremony such as a wedding, and more subtle (but no less significant) in the day-to-day workings\nof a relationship. (credit: modification of work by Shiraz Chanawala)\nBut, homophily limits our exposure to diversity (McPherson et al., 2001). By forming relationships only\nwithpeoplewhoaresimilartous,wewillhavehomogenousgroupsandwillnotbeexposedtodifferent\npointsofview.Inotherwords,becausewearelikelytospendtimewiththosewhoaremostlikeourselves,\nwe will have limited exposure to those who are different than ourselves, including people of different\nraces, ethnicities, social-economic status, and life situations.\nOnce we form relationships with people, we desire reciprocity. Reciprocity is the give and take in\nrelationships. We contribute to relationships, but we expect to receive benefits as well. That is, we want\nour relationships to be a two way street. We are more likely to like and engage with people who like us\nback. Self-disclosure is part of the two way street. Self-disclosure is the sharing of personal information\n(Laurenceau,Barrett,&Pietromonaco,1998).Weformmoreintimateconnectionswithpeoplewithwhom\nwe disclose important information about ourselves. Indeed, self-disclosure is a characteristic of healthy\nintimaterelationships,aslongastheinformationdisclosedisconsistentwithourownviews(Cozby,1973).\nATTRACTION\nWe have discussed how proximity and similarity lead to the formation of relationships, and that\nreciprocityandself-disclosureareimportantforrelationshipmaintenance.But,whatfeaturesofaperson\ndowefindattractive?Wedon\u2019tformrelationshipswitheveryonethatlivesorworksnearus,sohowisit\nthat we decide which specific individuals we will select as friends and lovers?\nResearchers have documented several characteristics in men and women that humans find attractive.\nFirst we look for friends and lovers who are physically attractive. People differ in what they consider\nattractive, and attractiveness is culturally influenced. Research, however, suggests that some universally\nattractive features in women include large eyes, high cheekbones, a narrow jaw line, a slender build\n(Buss, 1989), and a lower waist-to-hip ratio (Singh, 1993). For men, attractive traits include being tall,\nhaving broad shoulders, and a narrow waist (Buss, 1989). Both men and women with high levels of\nfacial and body symmetry are generally considered more attractive than asymmetric individuals (Fink,\nNeave, Manning, & Grammer, 2006; Penton-Voak et al., 2001; Rikowski & Grammer, 1999). Social traits\nthatpeoplefindattractiveinpotentialfemalematesincludewarmth,affection,andsocialskills;inmales,\nthe attractive traits include achievement, leadership qualities, and job skills (Regan & Berscheid, 1997).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology 441\nAlthough humans want mates who are physically attractive, this does not mean that we look for the\nmost attractive person possible.

If you think you are particularly unattractive (even if you are not), you likely will seek\npartners that are fairly unattractive (that is, unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior).\nSTERNBERG\u2019S TRIANGULAR THEORY OF LOVE\nWe typically love the people with whom we form relationships, but the type of love we have for our\nfamily, friends, and lovers differs. Robert Sternberg (1986) proposed that there are three components of\nlove: intimacy, passion, and commitment. These three components form a triangle that defines multiple\ntypesoflove:thisisknownasSternberg\u2019striangulartheoryoflove(Figure12.29).Intimacyisthesharing\nof details and intimate thoughts and emotions. Passion is the physical attraction\u2014the flame in the fire.\nCommitment is standing by the person\u2014the \u201cin sickness and health\u201d part of the relationship.\nFigure 12.29 According to Sternberg\u2019s triangular theory of love, seven types of love can be described from\ncombinations of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. (credit: modification of work by\n\u201cLnesa\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nSternberg (1986) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love\u2014intimacy,\npassion, and commitment\u2014which is described as consummate love (Figure 12.30). However, different\naspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages. Other forms of love include liking,\nwhich is defined as having intimacy but no passion or commitment. Infatuation is the presence of\npassionwithoutintimacyorcommitment.Emptyloveishavingcommitmentwithoutintimacyorpassion.\nCompanionate love, which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships, consists of\nintimacyandcommitmentbutnopassion.Romanticloveisdefinedbyhavingpassionandintimacy,but\nnocommitment.Finally,fatuousloveisdefinedbyhavingpassionandcommitment,butnointimacy,such\nasalongtermsexualloveaffair.Canyoudescribeotherexamplesofrelationshipsthatfitthesedifferent\ntypes of love? 442 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\nFigure 12.30 According to Sternberg, consummate love describes a healthy relationship containing intimacy,\npassion, and commitment.

Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as\nthose due to internal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and\nothersocialinfluences.Behaviorisbetterexplained,however,byusingbothapproaches.Laypeopletend\nto over-rely on dispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a\nperspectivecalledthefundamentalattributionerror.Peoplefromindividualistic culturesaremorelikely\nto display this bias versus people from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others\nbehaviors can be biased due to not having enough information about others\u2019 motivations for behaviors\nand by providing explanations that bolster our self-esteem. 446 Chapter 12 | Social Psychology\n12.2Self-presentation\nHuman behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to\nact in a given situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in\nsociety.Socialnormsdictatethebehaviorthatisappropriateorinappropriateforeachrole.Eachsocialrole\nhas scripts that help humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous\nStanford prison experiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles,\nnorms, and scripts we follow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.\n12.3Attitudes and Persuasion\nAttitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive\nor negative. Our attitudes and beliefs are influenced not only by external forces, but also by internal\ninfluences that we control. An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension\nwe experience when our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance,\nindividualscanchangetheirbehavior,attitudes,orcognitions,oraddanewcognition.Externalforcesof\npersuasionincludeadvertising;thefeaturesofadvertisingthatinfluenceourbehaviorsincludethesource,\nmessage,andaudience.Therearetwoprimaryroutestopersuasion.Thecentralroutetopersuasionuses\nfactsandinformationtopersuadepotentialconsumers.Theperipheralrouteusespositiveassociationwith\ncues such as beauty, fame, and positive emotions.\n12.4Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience\nThe power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face of\ninaccurateinformation.Conformitytogroupnormsisdrivenbytwomotivations,thedesiretofitinand\nbe liked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have\ninfluence over our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders\nare contrary to their personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or\nthe faulty decision-making process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group\nharmony.Groupsituationscanimprovehumanbehaviorthroughfacilitatingperformanceoneasytasks,\nbut inhibiting performance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when\nindividual efforts cannot be evaluated.\n12.5Prejudice and Discrimination\nAs diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different\nfrom each other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a\ndifferent social group (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination.\nPrejudice and discrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual\norientation,oravarietyofothersocialidentities.In-group\u2019swhofeelthreatenedmayblametheout-groups\nfor their plight, thus using the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.\n12.6Aggression\nAggression is seeking to cause another person harm or pain.

This site\nalso offers several I-O psychologist profiles.\nTHE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL\nPSYCHOLOGY\nIndustrial and organizational psychology had its origins in the early 20th century. Several influential\nearlypsychologistsstudiedissuesthattodaywouldbecategorizedasindustrialpsychology:JamesCattell\n(1860\u20131944) at Columbia, Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg (1863\u20131916) at Harvard, Walter Dill Scott (1869\u20131955) at\nNorthwestern, Robert Yerkes (1876\u20131956) and Walter Bingham (1880\u20131952) at Dartmouth, and Lillian\nGilbreth (1878\u20131972) at Purdue. Cattell, M\u00fcnsterberg, and Scott had been students of Wilhelm Wundt,\nthe father of experimental psychology. Some of these researchers had been involved in work in the area 456 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\nof industrial psychology before World War I. Cattell\u2019s contribution to industrial psychology is largely\nreflectedinhisfoundingofapsychologicalconsultingcompany,whichisstilloperatingtodaycalledthe\nPsychological Corporation, and in the accomplishments of students at Columbia in the area of industrial\npsychology.In1913,M\u00fcnsterbergpublishedPsychologyandIndustrialEfficiency,whichcoveredtopicssuch\nas employee selection, employee training, and effective advertising.\nScott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising, management, and personnel\nselection.In1903,Scottpublishedtwobooks:TheTheoryofAdvertisingandPsychologyofAdvertising.They\nare the first books to describe the use of psychology in the business world. By 1911 he published two\nmorebooks,InfluencingMeninBusinessandIncreasingHumanEfficiencyinBusiness.In1916anewlyformed\ndivision in the Carnegie Institute of Technology hired Scott to conduct applied research on employee\nselection (Katzell & Austin, 1992).\nThe focus of all this research was in what we now know as industrial psychology; it was only later in\nthe century that the field of organizational psychology developed as an experimental science (Katzell &\nAustin,1992).Inadditiontotheiracademicpositions,theseresearchersalsoworkeddirectlyforbusinesses\nas consultants.\nThe involvement of the United States in World War I in April 1917 catalyzed the participation in the\nmilitaryeffortofpsychologistsworkinginthisarea.AtthattimeYerkeswasthepresidentofthe25-year-\noldAmericanPsychologicalAssociation(APA).TheAPAisaprofessionalassociationintheUnitedStates\nforclinicalandresearchpsychologists.TodaytheAPAperformsanumberoffunctionsincludingholding\nconferences,accreditinguniversitydegreeprograms,andpublishingscientificjournals.Yerkesorganized\na group under the Surgeon General\u2019s Office (SGO) that developed methods for screening and selecting\nenlisted men. They developed the Army Alpha test to measure mental abilities. The Army Beta test was\na non-verbal form of the test that was administered to illiterate and non-English-speaking draftees. Scott\nand Bingham organized a group under the Adjutant General\u2019s Office (AGO) with the goal to develop\nselectionmethodsforofficers.TheycreatedacatalogueofoccupationalneedsfortheArmy,essentiallya\njob-descriptionsystemandasystemofperformanceratingsandoccupationalskilltestsforofficers(Katzell\n& Austin, 1992).\nAfter the war, work on personnel selection continued. For example, Millicent Pond, who received a PhD\nfrom Yale University, worked at several businesses and was director of employment test research at\nScovilleManufacturingCompany.Sheresearchedtheselectionoffactoryworkers,comparingtheresults\nof pre-employment tests with various indicators of job performance. These studies were published in a\nseries of research articles in theJournal of Personnel Researchin the late 1920s (Vinchur & Koppes, 2014).\nFrom 1929 to 1932 Elton Mayo (1880\u20131949) and his colleagues began a series of studies at a plant near\nChicago, Western Electric\u2019s Hawthorne Works (Figure 13.4). This long-term project took industrial\npsychology beyond just employee selection and placement to a study of more complex problems of\ninterpersonal relations, motivation, and organizational dynamics. These studies mark the origin of\norganizational psychology. They began as research into the effects of the physical work environment\n(e.g., level of lighting in a factory), but the researchers found that the psychological and social factors\nin the factory were of more interest than the physical factors. These studies also examined how human\ninteraction factors, such as supervisorial style, enhanced or decreased productivity.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology 457\nFigure 13.4 Hawthorne Works provided the setting for several early I-O studies.\nAnalysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the Hawthorne effect, which describes the\nincreaseinperformanceofindividualswhoarenoticed,watched,andpaidattentiontobyresearchersor\nsupervisorsFigure 13.5).Whattheoriginalresearchersfoundwasthatanychangeinavariable,suchas\nlightinglevels,ledtoanimprovementinproductivity;thiswastrueevenwhenthechangewasnegative,\nsuchasareturntopoorlighting.Theeffectfadedwhentheattentionfaded(Roethlisberg&Dickson,1939).\nThe Hawthorne-effect concept endures today as an important experimental consideration in many fields\nand a factor that has to be controlled for in an experiment. In other words, an experimental treatment of\nsome kind may produce an effect simply because it involves greater attention of the researchers on the\nparticipants (McCarney et al., 2007).\nFigure 13.5 Researchers discovered that employees performed better when researchers or supervisors observed\nand interacted with them, a dynamic termed the Hawthorne effect. 458 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ATT)to hear first-hand accounts of\nthe original Hawthorne studies from those who participated in the research.\nInthe1930s,researchersbegantostudyemployees\u2019 feelingsabouttheirjobs.KurtLewinalsoconducted\nresearchontheeffectsofvariousleadershipstyles,teamstructure,andteamdynamics(Katzell&Austin,\n1992).Lewinisconsideredthefounderofsocialpsychologyandmuchofhisworkandthatofhisstudents\nproduced results that had important influences in organizational psychology.

Bingham was hired as the chief\npsychologist for the War Department (now the Department of Defense) and developed new systems\nfor job selection, classification, training, ad performance review, plus methods for team development,\nmorale change, and attitude change (Katzell & Austin, 1992). Other countries, such as Canada and the\nUnited Kingdom, likewise saw growth in I-O psychology during World War II (McMillan, Stevens, &\nKelloway, 2009). In the years after the war, both industrial psychology and organizational psychology\nbecameareasofsignificantresearcheffort.Concernsaboutthefairnessofemploymenttestsarose,andthe\nethnic and gender biases in various tests were evaluated with mixed results.

This involves job analysis, which means accurately describing\nthe task or job. Then, organizations must identify the characteristics of applicants for a match to the job\nanalysis.Italsoinvolvestrainingemployeesfromtheirfirstdayonthejobthroughouttheirtenurewithin\nthe organization, and appraising their performance along the way.\nSELECTING EMPLOYEES\nWhen you read job advertisements, do you ever wonder how the company comes up with the job\ndescription? Often, this is done with the help of I-O psychologists. There are two related but different\napproachestojobanalysis\u2014youmaybefamiliarwiththeresultsofeachastheyoftenappearonthesame\njob advertisement. The first approach is task-oriented and lists in detail the tasks that will be performed\nfor the job. Each task is typically rated on scales for how frequently it is performed, how difficult it is,\nand how important it is to the job. The second approach is worker-oriented. This approach describes the\ncharacteristics required of the worker to successfully perform the job. This second approach has been\ncalledjobspecification(Dierdorff&Wilson,2003).Forjobspecification,theknowledge,skills,andabilities\n(KSAs) that the job requires are identified.\nObservation, surveys, and interviews are used to obtain the information required for both types of job\nanalysis. It is possible to observe someone who is proficient in a position and analyze what skills are\napparent.Another approach used isto interview people presently holding thatposition, theirpeers, and\ntheir supervisors to get a consensus of what they believe are the requirements of the job.\nHow accurate and reliable is a job analysis? Research suggests that it can depend on the nature of the\ndescriptions and the source for the job analysis. For example, Dierdorff & Wilson (2003) found that job\nanalyses developed from descriptions provided by people holding the job themselves were the least\nreliable; however, they did not study or speculate why this was the case.\nThe United States Department of Labor maintains a database of previously compiled job analyses for\ndifferent jobs and occupations. This allows the I-O psychologist to access previous analyses for nearly\nany type of occupation. This system is called O*Net (accessible at www.online.onetcenter.org). The site\nis open and you can see the KSAs that are listed for your own position or one you might be curious\nabout.Eachoccupationliststhetasks,knowledge,skills,abilities,workcontext,workactivities,education\nrequirements,interests,personalityrequirements,andworkstylesthataredeemednecessary forsuccess\nin that position. You can also see data on average earnings and projected job growth in that industry.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology 461\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe O*Net database describes the skills, knowledge, and education required for\noccupations, as well as what personality types and work styles are best suited to the\nrole. See what it has to say about being afood server in a restaurant\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sumreport1)or anelementary school teacher\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sumreport2)or anindustrial-organizational\npsychologist (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sumreport3).\nCandidate Analysis and Testing\nOnce a company identifies potential candidates for a position, the candidates\u2019 knowledge, skills, and\nother abilities must be evaluated and compared with the job description. These evaluations can involve\ntesting, an interview, and work samples or exercises. You learned about personality tests in the chapter\nonpersonality;intheI-Ocontext,theyareusedtoidentifythepersonalitycharacteristicsofthecandidate\ninanefforttomatchthosetopersonality characteristics thatwould ensuregood performance onthejob.\nForexample,ahighratingofagreeablenessmightbedesirableinacustomersupportposition.However,\nitisnotalwaysclearhowbesttocorrelatepersonalitycharacteristicswithpredictionsofjobperformance.\nIt might be that too high of a score on agreeableness is actually a hindrance in the customer support\nposition. For example, if a customer has a misperception about a product or service, agreeing with their\nmisperceptionwillnotultimatelyleadtoresolutionoftheircomplaint.Anyuseofpersonalitytestsshould\nbe accompanied by a verified assessment of what scores on the test correlate with good performance\n(Arthur,Woehr,&Graziano,2001).OthertypesofteststhatmaybegiventocandidatesincludeIQtests,\nintegrity tests, and physical tests, such as drug tests or physical fitness tests.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\nUsing Cutoff Scores to Determine Job Selection\nMany positions require applicants to take tests as part of the selection process. These can include IQ tests,\njob-specificskillstests,orpersonalitytests.Theorganizationmaysetcutoffscores(i.e.,ascorebelowwhicha\ncandidatewillnotmoveforward)foreachtesttodeterminewhethertheapplicantmovesontothenextstage.\nFor example, there was a case of Robert Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate who applied for a position\nwiththepoliceforceinNewLondon,Connecticut.Aspartoftheselectionprocess,JordantooktheWonderlic\nPersonnel Test (WPT), a test designed to measure cognitive ability.\nJordandidnotmakeittotheinterviewstagebecausehisWPTscoreof33,equivalenttoanIQscoreof125\n(100 is the average IQ score), was too high. The New London Police department policy is to not interview\nanyone who has a WPT score over 27 (equivalent to an IQ score over 104) because they believe anyone\nwho scores higher would be bored with police work. The average score for police officers nationwide is the\nequivalent of an IQ score of 104 (Jordan v. New London, 2000; ABC News, 2000).\nJordan sued the police department alleging that his rejection was discrimination and his civil rights were\nviolatedbecausehewasdeniedequalprotectionunderthelaw.The2ndU.S.CircuitCourtofAppealsupheld\na lower court\u2019s decision that the city of New London did not discriminate against him because the same\nstandards were applied to everyone who took the exam (The New York Times, 1999).\nWhatdoyouthink?Whenmightuniversalcutoffpointsmakesenseinahiringdecision,andwhenmightthey\neliminate otherwise potentially strong employees? 462 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\nInterviews\nMostjobsformid-sizetolarge-sizebusinessesintheUnitedStatesrequireapersonalinterviewasastepin\nthe selection process. Because interviews are commonly used, they have been the subject of considerable\nresearch by industrial psychologists. Information derived from job analysis usually forms the basis for\nthe types of questions asked. Interviews can provide a more dynamic source of information about the\ncandidatethanstandardtestingmeasures.Importantly,socialfactorsandbodylanguagecaninfluencethe\noutcomeoftheinterview.Theseincludeinfluences,suchasthedegreeofsimilarityoftheapplicanttothe\ninterviewerandnonverbalbehaviors,suchashandgestures,headnodding,andsmiling(Bye,Horverak,\nSandal, Sam, & Vivjer, 2014; Raki\u0107, Steffens, & Mummendey, 2011).\nThere are two types of interviews: unstructured and structured. In an unstructured interview, the\ninterviewermayaskdifferentquestionsofeachdifferentcandidate.Onecandidatemightbeaskedabout\nher career goals, and another might be asked about his previous work experience. In an unstructured\ninterview, the questions are often, though not always, unspecified beforehand. And in an unstructured\ninterview the responses to questions asked are generally not scored using a standard system. In a\nstructured interview, the interviewer asks the same questions of every candidate, the questions are\npreparedinadvance,andtheinterviewerusesastandardized ratingsystemforeachresponse.Withthis\napproach,theinterviewercanaccuratelycomparetwocandidates\u2019interviews.Inameta-analysisofstudies\nexamining the effectiveness of various types of job interviews, McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt & Maurer\n(1994) found that structured interviews were more effective at predicting subsequent job performance of\nthe job candidate.\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\nPreparing for the Job Interview\nYou might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview.

(credit: Cory Zanker)\nMentoring is a form of informal training in which an experienced employee guides the work of a new\nemployee. In some situations, mentors will be formally assigned to a new employee, while in others a\nmentoring relationship may develop informally.\nMentoring effects on the mentor and the employee being mentored, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, have been studied in\nrecent years. In a review of mentoring studies, Eby, Allen, Evans, Ng, & DuBois (2008) found significant\nbut small effects of mentoring on performance (i.e., behavioral outcomes), motivation and satisfaction,\nand actual career outcomes. In a more detailed review, Allen, Eby, Poteet, Lentz, & Lima (2004) found\nthat mentoring positively affected a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s compensation and number of promotions compared with\nnon-mentoredemployees.Inaddition,prot\u00e9g\u00e9sweremoresatisfiedwiththeircareersandhadgreaterjob\nsatisfaction. All of the effects were small but significant. Eby, Durley, Evans, & Ragins (2006) examined\nmentoringeffectsonthementorandfoundthatmentoringwasassociatedwithgreaterjobsatisfactionand\norganizational commitment. Gentry, Weber, & Sadri (2008) found that mentoring was positively related\nwith performance ratings by supervisors. Allen, Lentz, & Day (2006) found in a comparison of mentors\nand non-mentors that mentoring led to greater reported salaries and promotions. 464 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\nMentoring is recognized to be particularly important to the career success of women (McKeen & Bujaki,\n2007)bycreatingconnectionstoinformalnetworks,adoptingastyleofinteractionthatmalemanagersare\ncomfortable with, and with overcoming discrimination in job promotions.\nGendercombinations inmentoringrelationshipsarealsoanareaofactivestudy.Ragins&Cotton(1999)\nstudied the effects of gender on the outcomes of mentoring relationships and found that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with\na history of male mentors had significantly higher compensation especially for male prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The study\nfound that female mentor\u2013male prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships were considerably rarer than the other gender\ncombinations.\nIn an examination of a large number of studies on the effectiveness of organizational training to meet its\ngoals, Arthur, Bennett, Edens, and Bell (2003) found that training was, in fact, effective when measured\nby the immediate response of the employee to the training effort, evaluation of learning outcomes (e.g.,\na test at the end of the training), behavioral measurements of job activities by a supervisor, and results-\nbased criteria (e.g., productivity or profits). The examined studies represented diverse forms of training\nincluding self-instruction, lecture and discussion, and computer assisted training.\nEVALUATING EMPLOYEES\nIndustrial and organizational psychologists are typically involved in designing performance-appraisal\nsystemsfororganizations.Thesesystemsaredesignedtoevaluatewhethereachemployeeisperforming\nher job satisfactorily.

Part of the function of performance appraisals for the\norganization is to document poor performance to bolster decisions to terminate an employee.\nPerformance appraisals are becoming more complex processes within organizations and are often used\nto motivate employees to improve performance and expand their areas of competence, in addition to\nassessing their job performance. In this capacity, performance appraisals can be used to identify\nopportunities for training or whether a particular training program has been successful. One approach\nto performance appraisal is called 360-degree feedback appraisal (Figure 13.9). In this system, the\nemployee\u2019sappraisalderivesfromacombinationofratingsbysupervisors,peers,employeessupervised\nby the employee, and from the employee herself.

However, in practice, many performance evaluations are disliked by organizations, employees, or\nboth (Fletcher, 2001), and few of them have been adequately tested to see if they do in fact improve\nperformance or motivate employees (DeNisi & Kluger, 2000). One of the reasons evaluations fail to\naccomplish their purpose in an organization is that performance appraisal systems are often used\nincorrectly or are of an inappropriate type for an organization\u2019s particular culture (Schraeder, Becton, &\nPortis,2007).Anorganization\u2019scultureishowtheorganizationisrun,howitoperates,andhowitmakes\ndecisions.

The Court ultimately decided against\nthe plaintiffs, and the right to a class-action suit was denied. However, the case itself effectively publicized\nthe issue of gender discrimination in employment. Thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/SCOTUS1)\ndiscusses the case history and issues.

It was described by Edwin Locke\n(1976)asthestateoffeelingresultingfromappraisingone\u2019sjobexperiences.Whilejobsatisfactionresults\nfrom both how we think about our work (our cognition) and how we feel about our work (our affect)\n(Saari&Judge,2004),itisdescribedintermsofaffect.Jobsatisfactionisimpactedbytheworkitself,our\npersonality, and the culture we come from and live in (Saari & Judge, 2004).\nJobsatisfactionistypicallymeasuredafterachangeinanorganization,suchasashiftinthemanagement\nmodel,toassesshowthechangeaffectsemployees.Itmayalsoberoutinelymeasuredbyanorganization\nto assess one of many factors expected to affect the organization\u2019s performance. In addition, polling\ncompanies like Gallup regularly measure job satisfaction on a national scale to gather broad information\non the state of the economy and the workforce (Saad, 2012).\nJob satisfaction is measured using questionnaires that employees complete. Sometimes a single question\nmight be asked in a very straightforward way to which employees respond using a rating scale, such\nas a Likert scale, which was discussed in the chapter on personality. A Likert scale (typically) provides\nfive possible answers to a statement or question that allows respondents to indicate their positive-to-\nnegative strength of agreement or strength of feeling regarding the question or statement. Thus the\npossible responses to a question such as \u201cHow satisfied are you with your job today?\u201d might be \u201cVery\nsatisfied,\u201d\u201cSomewhatsatisfied,\u201d\u201cNeithersatisfied,nordissatisfied,\u201d\u201cSomewhatdissatisfied,\u201dand\u201cVery\ndissatisfied.\u201dMorecommonlythesurveywillaskanumberofquestionsabouttheemployee\u2019ssatisfaction\nto determine more precisely why he is satisfied or dissatisfied. Sometimes these surveys are created for\nspecific jobs; at other times, they are designed to apply to any job. Job satisfaction can be measured at a\ngloballevel,meaninghowsatisfiedingeneraltheemployeeiswithwork,oratthelevelofspecificfactors\nintended to measure which aspects of the job lead to satisfaction (Table 13.1).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology 471\nTable 13.1Factors Involved in Job Satisfaction\u2013Dissatisfaction\nFactor Description\nAutonomy Individual responsibility, control over decisions\nWork content Variety, challenge, role clarity\nCommunication Feedback\nFinancial rewards Salary and benefits\nGrowth and development Personal growth, training, education\nPromotion Career advancement opportunity\nCoworkers Professional relations or adequacy\nSupervision and feedback Support, recognition, fairness\nWorkload Time pressure, tedium\nWork demands Extra work requirements, insecurity of position\nResearch has suggested that the work-content factor, which includes variety, difficulty level, and role\nclarityofthejob,isthemoststronglypredictivefactorofoveralljobsatisfaction(Saari&Judge,2004).In\ncontrast,thereisonlyaweakcorrelationbetweenpaylevelandjobsatisfaction(Judge,Piccolo,Podsakoff,\nShaw,&Rich,2010).Judgeetal.(2010)suggestthatindividualsadjustoradapttohigherpaylevels:Higher\npay no longer provides the satisfaction the individual may have initially felt when her salary increased.\nWhy should we care about job satisfaction?

Job satisfaction is related\ntogenerallifesatisfaction,althoughtherehasbeenlimitedresearchonhowthetwoinfluenceeachother\nor whether personality and cultural factors affect both job and general life satisfaction. One carefully\ncontrolled study suggested that the relationship is reciprocal: Job satisfaction affects life satisfaction\npositively, and vice versa (Judge & Watanabe, 1993). Of course, organizations cannot control life\nsatisfaction\u2019s influence on job satisfaction. Job satisfaction, specifically low job satisfaction, is also related\nto withdrawal behaviors, such as leaving a job or absenteeism (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). The\nrelationshipwithturnoveritself,however,isweak(Judge&Kammeyer-Mueller,2012).Finally,itappears\nthat job satisfaction is related to organizational performance, which suggests that implementing\norganizational changes to improve employee job satisfaction will improve organizational performance\n(Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012).\nThereisopportunityformoreresearchintheareaofjobsatisfaction.Forexample,Weiss(2002)suggests\nthattheconceptofjobsatisfactionmeasurementshavecombinedbothemotionalandcognitiveconcepts,\nandmeasurementswouldbemorereliableandshowbetterrelationshipswithoutcomeslikeperformance\nif the measurement of job satisfaction separated these two possible elements of job satisfaction. 472 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\nDIG DEEPER\nJob Satisfaction in Federal Government Agencies\nA2013studyofjobsatisfaction intheU.S. federalgovernment foundindexesofjobsatisfaction plummeting\ncomparedtotheprivatesector.Thelargestfactorinthedeclinewassatisfactionwithpay,followedbytraining\nanddevelopmentopportunities.ThePartnershipforPublicService,anonprofit,nonpartisanorganization,has\nconductedresearchonfederalemployeejobsatisfactionsince2003.Itsprimarygoalistoimprovethefederal\ngovernment\u2019s management.

Job stress, or job strain, is caused by specific stressors in an occupation.\nStresscanbeanambigioustermasitisusedincommonlanguage.Stressistheperceptionandresponseof\nanindividualtoeventsjudgedasovewhelmingorthreateningtotheindividual\u2019swell-being(Gyllensten\n&Palmer,2005).Theeventsthemselvesarethestressors.Stressisaresultofanemployee\u2019sperceptionthat\nthedemandsplacedonthemexceedtheirabilitytomeetthem(Gyllensten&Palmer,2005),suchashaving\ntofillmultiplerolesinajoborlifeingeneral,workplaceroleambiguity,lackofcareerprogress,lackofjob\nsecurity, lack of control over work outcomes, isolation, work overload, discrimination, harrassment, and\nbullying(Colligan&Higgins,2005).Thestressorsaredifferentforwomenthanmenandthesedifferences\nareasignificantareaofresearch(Gyllensten&Palmer,2005).Jobstressleadstopooremployeehealth,job\nperformance, and family life (Colligan & Higgins, 2005).\nAs already mentioned, job insecurity contributes significantly to job stress. Two increasing threats to job\nsecurity are downsizing events and corporate mergers. Businesses typically involve I-O psychologists in\nplanning for, implementing, and managing these types of organizational change.\nDownsizing is an increasingly common response to a business\u2019s pronounced failure to achieve profit\ngoals, and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company\u2019s employees. Industrial-\norganizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing: how the news is delivered\nto employees (both those being let go and those staying), how laid-off employees are supported (e.g.,\nseparation packages), and how retained employees are supported. The latter is important for the\norganization because downsizing events affect the retained employee\u2019s intent to quit, organizational\ncommitment, and job insecurity (Ugboro, 2006).\nIn addition to downsizing as a way of responding to outside strains on a business, corporations often\ngrow larger by combining with other businesses. This can be accomplished through a merger (i.e., the\njoiningoftwoorganizationsofequalpowerandstatus)oranacquisition(i.e.,oneorganizationpurchases\nthe other). In an acquisition, the purchasing organization is usually the more powerful or dominant\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology 473\npartner. In both cases, there is usually a duplication of services between the two companies, such as\ntwo accounting departments and two sales forces. Both departments must be merged, which commonly\ninvolves a reduction of staff (Figure 13.13). This leads to organizational processes and stresses similar\nto those that occur in downsizing events. Mergers require determining how the organizational culture\nwill change, to which employees also must adjust (van Knippenberg, van Knippenberg, Monden, & de\nLima,2002).Therecanbeadditionalstressonworkersastheylosetheirconnectiontotheoldorganization\nand try to make connections with the new combined group (Amiot, Terry, Jimmieson, & Callan, 2006).\nResearch in this area focuses on understanding employee reactions and making practical\nrecommendations for managing these organizational changes.\nFigure 13.13 When companies are combined through a merger (or acquisition), there are often cuts due to\nduplication of core functions, like sales and accounting, at each company.\nWORK\u2013FAMILY BALANCE\nManypeoplejugglethedemandsofworklifewiththedemandsoftheirhomelife,whetheritbecaringfor\nchildrenortakingcareofanelderlyparent;thisisknownaswork-familybalance.Wemightcommonly\nthink about work interfering with family, but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict\nwith work obligations (Carlson, Kacmar, & Williams, 2000). Greenhaus and Beutell (1985) first identified\nthree sources of work\u2013family conflicts:\n\u2022 time devoted to work makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of family, or vice versa,\n\u2022 strain from participation in work makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of family, or vice versa,\nand\n\u2022 specific behaviors required by work make it difficult to fulfill the requirements of family, or vice\nversa.\nWomenoftenhavegreaterresponsibilityforfamilydemands,includinghomecare,childcare,andcaring\nfor aging parents, yet men in the United States are increasingly assuming a greater share of domestic\nresponsibilities. However, research has documented that women report greater levels of stress from\nwork\u2013family conflict (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005).\nThere are many ways to decrease work\u2013family conflict and improve people\u2019s job satisfaction (Posig &\nKickul, 2004). These include support in the home, which can take various forms: emotional (listening), 474 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\npractical (help with chores). Workplace support can include understanding supervisors, flextime, leave\nwith pay, and telecommuting. Flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the\nworkplacearoundwhichtheemployeemayschedulehisarrivalanddeparturefromworktomeetfamily\ndemands. Telecommuting involves employees working at home and setting their own hours, which\nallows them to work during different parts of the day, and to spend part of the day with their family.\nRecall that Yahoo! had a policy of allowing employees to telecommute and then rescinded the policy.\nThere are also organizations that have onsite daycare centers, and some companies even have onsite\nfitness centers and health clinics. In a study of the effectiveness of different coping methods, Lapierre\n& Allen (2006) found practical support from home more important than emotional support. They also\nfoundthatimmediate-supervisorsupportforaworkersignificantlyreducedwork\u2013familyconflictthrough\nsuchmechanisms asallowing anemployeetheflexibilityneededtofulfillfamilyobligations.

Use this site to research\npossible careers and/or organizations that interest you.\nMANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nA significant portion of I-O research focuses on management and human relations. Douglas McGregor\n(1960) combined scientific management (a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes\nworkflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity) and\nhuman relations into the notion of leadership behavior. His theory lays out two different styles called\nTheory X and Theory Y. In the Theory X approach to management, managers assume that most people\ndislike work and are not innately self-directed. Theory X managers perceive employees as people who\nprefertobeledandtoldwhichtaskstoperformandwhen.Theiremployeeshavetobewatchedcarefully\nto be sure that they work hard enough to fulfill the organization\u2019s goals.

Employees function better under leadership that allows them to\nparticipate in, and provide input about, setting their personal and work goals. In Theory Y workplaces,\nemployees participate in decisions about prioritizing tasks; they may belong to teams that, once given a\ngoal,decidethemselveshowitwillbeaccomplished.Insuchaworkplace,employeesareabletoprovide\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology 475\ninput on matters of efficiency and safety. One example of Theroy Y in action is the policy of Toyota\nproductionlinesthatallowsanyemployeetostoptheentirelineifadefectorotherissueappears,sothat\nthedefectcanbefixedanditscauseremedied(ToyotaMotorManufacturing,2013).ATheoryYworkplace\nwill also meaningfully consult employees on any changes to the work process or management system.\nIn addition, the organization will encourage employees to contribute their own ideas. McGregor (1960)\ncharacterized Theory X as the traditional method of management used in the United States. He agued\nthataTheoryYapproachwasneededtoimproveorganizationaloutputandthewellbeingofindividuals.\nTable 13.2summarizes how these two management approaches differ.\nTable 13.2Theory X and Theory Y Management Styles\nTheory X Theory Y\nPeople dislike work and avoid it. People enjoy work and find it natural.\nPeople avoid responsibility. People are more satisified when given\nresponsibility.\nPeople want to be told what to do. People want to take part in setting their own work\ngoals.\nGoals are achieved through rules and Goals are achieved through enticements and\npunishments. rewards.\nAnother management style was described by Donald Clifton, who focused his research on how an\norganization can best use an individual\u2019s strengths, an approach he called strengths-based management.\nHeandhiscolleaguesinterviewed8,000managersandconcludedthatitisimportanttofocusonaperson\u2019s\nstrengths,nottheirweaknesses.Astrengthisaparticularenduringtalentpossessedbyanindividualthat\nallows her to provide consistent, near-perfect performance in tasks involving that talent. Clifton argued\nthatourstrengthsprovidethegreatestopportunityforgrowth(Buckingham&Clifton,2001).Anexample\nof a strength is public speaking or the ability to plan a successful event. The strengths-based approach\nis very popular although its effect on organization performance is not well-studied. However, Kaiser &\nOverfield (2011) found that managers often neglected improving their weaknesses and overused their\nstrengths, both of which interfered with performance.\nLeadershipisanimportantelementofmanagement.Leadershipstyleshavebeenofmajorinterestwithin\nI-O research, and researchers have proposed numerous theories of leadership. Bass (1985) popularized\nand developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles. In\ntransactionalleadership,thefocusisonsupervisionandorganizationalgoals,whichareachievedthrough\na system of rewards and punishments (i.e., transactions). Transactional leaders maintain the status quo:\nTheyaremanagers.Thisisincontrasttothetransformational leader.Peoplewhohavetransformational\nleadership possess four attributes to varying degrees: They are charismatic (highly liked role models),\ninspirational(optimisticaboutgoalattainment),intellectuallystimulating(encouragecriticalthinkingand\nproblem solving), and considerate (Bass, Avolio, & Atwater, 1996).\nAs women increasingly take on leadership roles in corporations, questions have arisen as to whether\nthere are differences in leadership styles between men and women (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van\nEngen,2003).Eagly&Johnson(1990)conductedameta-analysistoexaminegenderandleadershipstyle.\nThey found, to a slight but significant degree, that women tend to practice an interpersonal style of\nleadership(i.e.,shefocusesonthemoraleandwelfareoftheemployees)andmenpracticeatask-oriented\nstyle (i.e., he focuses on accomplishing tasks). However, the differences were less pronounced when one\nlookedonlyatorganizationalstudiesandexcludedlaboratoryexperimentsorsurveysthatdidnotinvolve\nactual organizational leaders. Larger sex-related differences were observed when leadership style was 476 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology\ncategorized as democratic or autocratic, and these differences were consistent across all types of studies.\nThe authors suggest that similarities between the sexes in leadership styles are attributable to both sexes\nneeding to conform the organization\u2019s culture; additionally, they propose that sex-related differences\nreflectinherentdifferencesinthestrengthseachsexbringstobearonleadershippractice.Inanothermeta-\nanalysis of leadership style, Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) found that women tended\nto exhibit the characteristics of transformational leaders, while men were more likely to be transactional\nleaders. However, the differences are not absolute; for example, women were found to use methods of\nreward for performance more often than men, which is a component of transactional leadership. The\ndifferences they found were relatively small. As Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) point\nout, research shows that transformational leadership approaches are more effective than transactional\napproaches, although individual leaders typically exhibit elements of both approaches.\nGOALS, TEAMWORK AND WORK TEAMS\nThe workplace today is rapidly changing due to a variety of factors, such as shifts in technology,\neconomics, foreign competition, globalization, and workplace demographics. Organizations need to\nrespond quickly to changes in these factors. Many companies are responding to these changes by\nstructuringtheirorganizationssothatworkcanbedelegatedtoworkteams,whichbringtogetherdiverse\nskills, experience, and expertise. This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at\ntheir base (Naquin & Tynan, 2003). In the team-based approach, teams are brought together and given a\nspecific task or goal to accomplish. Despite their burgeoning popularity, team structures do not always\ndeliver greater productivity\u2014the work of teams is an active area of research (Naquin & Tynan, 2003).\nWhy do some teams work well while others do not? There are many contributing factors. For example,\nteams can mask team members that are not working (i.e., social loafing). Teams can be inefficient due to\npoor communication; they can have poor decision-making skills due to conformity effects; and, they can\nhaveconflictwithinthegroup.Thepopularityofteamsmayinpartresultfromtheteamhaloeffect:Teams\nare given credit for their successes. but individuals within a team are blamed for team failures (Naquin\n& Tynan, 2003). One aspect of team diversity is their gender mix. Researchers have explored whether\ngendermixhasaneffectonteamperformance.Ontheonehand,diversitycanintroducecommunication\nandinterpersonal-relationshipproblemsthathinderperformance,butontheotherhanddiversitycanalso\nincreasetheteam\u2019sskillset,whichmayincludeskillsthatcanactuallyimproveteammemberinteractions.\nHoogendoorn, Oosterbeek, & van Praag (2013) studied project teams in a university business school\nin which the gender mix of the teams was manipulated. They found that gender-balanced teams (i.e.,\nnearly equal numbers of men and women) performed better, as measured by sales and profits, than\npredominantly male teams. The study did not have enough data to determine the relative performance\nof female dominated teams. The study was unsuccessful in identifying which mechanism (interpersonal\nrelationships, learning, or skills mixes) accounted for performance improvement.\nTherearethreebasictypesofteams:problemresolutionteams,creativeteams,andtacticalteams.Problem\nresolution teams are created for the purpose of solving a particular problem or issue; for example, the\ndiagnostic teams at the Centers for Disease Control. Creative teams are used to develop innovative\npossibilities or solutions; for example, design teams for car manufacturers create new vehicle models.\nTactical teams are used to execute a well-defined plan or objective, such as a police or FBI SWAT team\nhandling a hostage situation (Larson & LaFasto, 1989).

Millennials (born from 1979 to the early\n1994) began to come of age at the turn of the century, and are early in their careers.\nToday, as these three different generations work side by side in the workplace, employers and managers\nneed to be able to identify their unique characteristics. Each generation has distinctive expectations, habits,\nattitudes,andmotivations(Elmore,2010).Oneofthemajordifferencesamongthesegenerationsisknowledge\nof the use of technology in the workplace. Millennials are technologically sophisticated and believe their use\nof technology sets them apart from other generations. They have also been characterized as self-centered\nand overly self-confident. Their attitudinal differences have raised concerns for managers about maintaining\ntheirmotivationasemployeesandtheirabilitytointegrateintoorganizationalculturecreatedbybabyboomers\n(Myers&Sadaghiani,2010).Forexample,millennialsmayexpecttohearthattheyneedtopaytheirduesin\ntheir jobs from baby boomers who believe they paid their dues in their time.

Retaining Generation X workers thus relies on motivating them by making their work\nmeaningful(Gibson,Greenwood,&Murphy,2009).Sincemillennialslackaninherentloyaltytothecompany,\nretaining them also requires effort in the form of nurturing through frequent rewards, praise, and feedback.\nMillennials are also interested in having many choices, including options in work scheduling, choice of job\nduties, and soon.

Warning signs often precede such actions: intimidating behavior, threats,\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 13 | Industrial-Organizational Psychology 479\nsabotaging equipment, or radical changes in a coworker\u2019s behavior. Often there is intimidation and then\nescalation that leads to even further escalation. It is important for employees to involve their immediate\nsupervisor if they ever feel intimidated or unsafe.\nMurder is the second leading cause of death in the workplace.

In addition to many usual\nstresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams, term papers, and the dreaded\nfreshman 15), students today are faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty\nfinding employment after graduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may\nfaceadditionalstressors,suchasraisingchildrenorholdingdownafull-timejobwhileworkingtowarda\ndegree.\nOfcourse,lifeisfilledwithmanyadditionalchallengesbeyondthoseincurredincollegeortheworkplace.\nWe might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family\nresponsibilities, and we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do.

This chapter examines stress and highlights our current understanding of the phenomenon,\nincluding its psychological and physiological natures, its causes and consequences, and thesteps we can\ntake to master stress rather than become its victim. 488 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\n14.1 What Is Stress?\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Differentiate between stimulus-based and response-based definitions of stress\n\u2022 Define stress as a process\n\u2022 Differentiate between good stress and bad stress\n\u2022 Describe the early contributions of Walter Cannon and Hans Selye to the stress research\nfield\n\u2022 Understand the physiological basis of stress and describe the general adaptation syndrome\nThetermstressasitrelatestothehumanconditionfirstemergedinscientificliteratureinthe1930s,butit\ndidnotenterthepopularvernacularuntilthe1970s(Lyon,2012).Today,weoftenusethetermlooselyin\ndescribing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we\nfeelfrustrated,angry,conflicted,overwhelmed,orfatigued.Despitethewidespreaduseoftheterm,stress\nis a fairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.\nResearchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress. Some have\nconceptualized stress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job,\novercrowding, and long commutes to work). Such conceptualizations are known as stimulus-based\ndefinitions because they characterize stress as a stimulus that causes certain reactions. Stimulus-based\ndefinitionsofstressareproblematic,however,becausetheyfailtorecognizethatpeopledifferinhowthey\nview and react to challenging life events and situations. For example, a conscientious student who has\nstudied diligentlyallsemester would likelyexperiencelessstress duringfinalexamsweekthanwould a\nless responsible, unprepared student.\nOthers have conceptualized stress in ways that emphasize the physiological responses that occur when\nfaced with demanding or threatening situations (e.g., increased arousal). These conceptualizations are\nreferred to as response-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental\nconditions. For example, the endocrinologist Hans Selye, a famous stress researcher, once defined stress\nasthe\u201cresponseofthebodytoanydemand,whetheritiscausedby,orresultsin,pleasantorunpleasant\nconditions\u201d(Selye,1976,p.74).Selye\u2019sdefinitionofstressisresponse-basedinthatitconceptualizesstress\nchieflyintermsofthebody\u2019sphysiologicalreactiontoanydemandthatisplacedonit.Neitherstimulus-\nbased nor response-based definitions provide a complete definition of stress. Many of the physiological\nreactions that occur when faced with demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur\nin response to things that most people would not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving\nunanticipated good news: an unexpected promotion or raise.\nA useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and\nresponds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well-being (Lazarus &\nFolkman, 1984). A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we\nappraise\u2014that is, judge\u2014demanding or threatening events (often referred to as stressors); these\nappraisals, in turn, influence our reactions to such events.

In considering the breast lump, some of the thoughts racing\nthrough Robin\u2019s mind are, \u201cOh my God, I could have breast cancer!

As such, Robin would clearly experience greater stress than\nwould Maria. 490 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.3 When encountering a stressor, a person judges its potential threat (primary appraisal) and then\ndetermines if effective options are available to manage the situation. Stress is likely to result if a stressor is perceived\nas extremely threatening or threatening with few or no effective coping options available.\nTobesure,somestressorsareinherentlymorestressfulthanothersinthattheyaremorethreateningand\nleave less potential for variation in cognitive appraisals (e.g., objective threats to one\u2019s health or safety).\nNevertheless, appraisal will still play a role in augmenting or diminishing our reactions to such events\n(Everly & Lating, 2002).\nIfapersonappraisesaneventasharmfulandbelievesthatthedemandsimposedbytheeventexceedthe\navailable resources to manage or adapt to it, the person will subjectively experience a state of stress. In\ncontrast, if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening, she is unlikely to experience\nstress.

Stress can motivate\nus to do things in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and\nperform to the best of our ability at work. Indeed, Selye (1974) pointed out that not all stress is harmful.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 491\nHe argued that stress can sometimes be a positive, motivating force that can improve the quality of\nour lives. This kind of stress, which Selye called eustress (from the Greek eu = \u201cgood\u201d), is a good\nkind of stress associated with positive feelings, optimal health, and performance. A moderate amount of\nstress can be beneficial in challenging situations. For example, athletes may be motivated and energized\nby pregame stress, and students may experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam. Indeed,\nresearch shows that moderate stress can enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational\nmaterial. Male participants in one study who memorized a scientific text passage showed improved\nmemory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild stressor as well as one day following\nexposure to the stressor (Hupbach & Fieman, 2012).\nIncreasingone\u2019slevelofstresswillcauseperformancetochangeinapredictableway.AsshowninFigure\n14.4, as stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach\nan optimal level (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak.

But when stress exceeds this optimal level, it is no longer a\npositive force\u2014it becomes excessive and debilitating, or what Selye termed distress (from the Latin dis\n= \u201cbad\u201d). People who reach this level of stress feel burned out; they are fatigued, exhausted, and their\nperformancebeginstodecline.Ifthestressremainsexcessive,healthmaybegintoerodeaswell(Everly&\nLating, 2002).\nFigure 14.4 As the stress level increases from low to moderate, so does performance (eustress). At the optimal\nlevel (the peak of the curve), performance has reached its peak. If stress exceeds the optimal level, it will reach the\ndistress region, where it will become excessive and debilitating, and performance will decline (Everly & Lating, 2002).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF STRESS\nStress is everywhere and, as shown in Figure 14.5, it has been on the rise over the last several years.\nEachofusisacquaintedwithstress\u2014somearemorefamiliarthanothers.Inmanyways,stressfeelslikea\nloadyoujustcan\u2019tcarry\u2014afeelingyouexperiencewhen,forexample,youhavetodrivesomewhereina\ncripplingblizzard,whenyouwakeuplatethemorningofanimportantjobinterview,whenyourunout\nofmoneybeforethenextpayperiod,andbeforetakinganimportantexamforwhichyourealizeyouare\nnot fully prepared. 492 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.5 Nearly half of U.S. adults indicated that their stress levels have increased over the last five years\n(Neelakantan, 2013).\nStress is an experience that evokes a variety of responses, including those that are physiological (e.g.,\naccelerated heart rate, headaches, or gastrointestinal problems), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating\nor making decisions), and behavioral (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking actions directed at\neliminatingthecauseofthestress).Althoughstresscanbepositiveattimes,itcanhavedeleterioushealth\nimplications, contributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases\n(Cohen & Herbert, 1996).\nThe scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of\nhealth psychology, a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological\ninfluences on health, illness, and how people respond when they become ill (Taylor, 1999). Health\npsychology emerged as a discipline in the 1970s, a time during which there was increasing awareness\nof the role behavioral and lifestyle factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases (Straub,\n2007). In addition to studying the connection between stress and illness, health psychologists investigate\nissues such as why people make certain lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking or eating unhealthy food despite\nknowing the potential adverse health implications of such behaviors). Health psychologists also design\nandinvestigatetheeffectivenessofinterventionsaimedatchangingunhealthybehaviors.Perhapsoneof\nthemorefundamentaltasksofhealthpsychologistsistoidentifywhichgroupsofpeopleareespeciallyat\nrisk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological or behavioral factors. For example, measuring\ndifferences in stress levels among demographic groups and how these levels change over time can help\nidentify populations who may have an increased risk for illness or disease.\nFigure 14.6 depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from\ndifferent demographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire; the surveys were administered in\n1983, 2006, and 2009 (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in\nwomen than in men. Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys, as did\nthose with less education and income; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels. However, from\n2006to2009thegreatestincreaseinstresslevelsoccurredamongmen,Whites,peopleaged45\u201364,college\ngraduates, and those with full-time employment. One interpretation of these findings is that concerns\nsurrounding the 2008\u20132009 economic downturn (e.g., threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of\nretirement savings) may have been especially stressful to White, college-educated, employed men with\nlimited time remaining in their working careers.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 493\nFigure 14.6 The charts above, adapted from Cohen & Janicki-Deverts (2012), depict the mean stress level scores\namong different demographic groups during the years 1983, 2006, and 2009. Across categories of sex, age, race,\neducation level, employment status, and income, stress levels generally show a marked increase over this quarter-\ncentury time span.\nEARLY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF STRESS\nAspreviouslystated,scientificinterestinstressgoesbacknearlyacentury.Oneoftheearlypioneersinthe\nstudyofstresswasWalterCannon,aneminentAmericanphysiologistatHarvardMedicalSchool(Figure\n14.7). In the early part of the 20th century, Cannon was the first to identify the body\u2019s physiological\nreactions to stress. 494 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.7 Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon first articulated and named the fight-or-flight response, the nervous\nsystem\u2019s sympathetic response to a significant stressor.\nCannon and the Fight-or-Flight Response\nImaginethatyouarehikinginthebeautifulmountainsofColoradoonawarmandsunnyspringday.At\none point during your hike, a large, frightening-looking black bear appears from behind a stand of trees\nandsitsabout50yardsfromyou.Thebearnoticesyou,sitsup,andbeginstolumberinyourdirection.In\nadditiontothinking,\u201cThisisdefinitelynotgood,\u201daconstellationofphysiologicalreactionsbeginstotake\nplace inside you.

Your heart starts to pound and speeds up, you\nbegintobreatheheavilyandperspire,yougetbutterfliesinyourstomach,andyourmusclesbecometense,\npreparing you to take some kind of direct action. Cannon proposed that this reaction, which he called\nthe fight-or-flight response, occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions\u2014especially those\nassociatedwithaperceivedthreat(Cannon,1932).Duringthefight-or-flightresponse,thebodyisrapidly\naroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system (Figure 14.8).\nThis arousal helps prepare the person to either fight or flee from a perceived threat.\nFigure 14.8 Fight or flight is a physiological response to a stressor.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 495\nAccording to Cannon, the fight-or-flight response is a built-in mechanism that assists in maintaining\nhomeostasis\u2014an internal environment in which physiological variables such as blood pressure,\nrespiration,digestion,andtemperaturearestabilizedatlevelsoptimalforsurvival.Thus,Cannonviewed\nthefight-or-flightresponseasadaptivebecauseitenablesustoadjustinternallyandexternallytochanges\nin our surroundings, which is helpful in species survival.\nSelye and the General Adaptation Syndrome\nAnother important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye, mentioned earlier. He would\neventually become one of the world\u2019s foremost experts in the study of stress (Figure 14.9). As a young\nassistantinthebiochemistrydepartmentatMcGillUniversityinthe1930s,Selyewasengagedinresearch\ninvolving sex hormones in rats. Although he was unable to find an answer for what he was initially\nresearching, he incidentally discovered that when exposed to prolonged negative stimulation\n(stressors)\u2014such as extreme cold, surgical injury, excessive muscular exercise, and shock\u2014the rats\nshowedsignsofadrenalenlargement,thymusandlymphnodeshrinkage,andstomachulceration.Selye\nrealizedthattheseresponsesweretriggeredbyacoordinatedseriesofphysiologicalreactionsthatunfold\novertimeduringcontinuedexposuretoastressor.Thesephysiologicalreactionswerenonspecific,which\nmeans that regardless of the type of stressor, the same pattern of reactions would occur. What Selye\ndiscoveredwasthegeneraladaptationsyndrome,thebody\u2019snonspecificphysiologicalresponsetostress.\nFigure 14.9 Hans Selye specialized in research about stress. In 2009, his native Hungary honored his work with this\nstamp, released in conjunction with the 2nd annual World Conference on Stress.\nThegeneraladaptationsyndrome,showninFigure 14.10,consistsofthreestages:(1)alarmreaction,(2)\nstage of resistance, and (3) stage of exhaustion (Selye, 1936; 1976). Alarm reaction describes the body\u2019s\nimmediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency, and it is roughly analogous to the\nfight-or-flight response described by Cannon. During an alarm reaction, you are alerted to a stressor,\nandyourbodyalarmsyouwithacascade ofphysiological reactions thatprovide youwiththeenergyto\nmanagethesituation.Apersonwhowakesupinthemiddleofthenighttodiscoverherhouseisonfire,\nfor example, is experiencing an alarm reaction. 496 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.10 The three stages of Selye\u2019s general adaptation syndrome are shown in this graph. Prolonged stress\nultimately results in exhaustion.\nIf exposure to a stressor is prolonged, the organism will enter the stage of resistance. During this stage,\ntheinitialshockofalarmreactionhaswornoffandthebodyhasadaptedtothestressor.Nevertheless,the\nbodyalsoremainsonalertandispreparedtorespondasitdidduringthealarmreaction,althoughwith\nless intensity. For example, suppose a child who went missing is still missing 72 hours later. Although\ntheparentswouldobviouslyremainextremelydisturbed,themagnitudeofphysiologicalreactionswould\nlikely have diminished over the 72 intervening hours due to some adaptation to this event.\nIf exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time, the stage of exhaustion ensues. At this\nstage, the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor: the body\u2019s ability to resist becomes depleted\nas physical wear takes its toll on the body\u2019s tissues and organs. As a result, illness, disease, and other\npermanent damage to the body\u2014even death\u2014may occur. If a missing child still remained missing after\nthreemonths,thelong-termstressassociatedwiththissituationmaycauseaparenttoliterallyfaintwith\nexhaustion at some point or even to develop a serious and irreversible illness.\nIn short, Selye\u2019s general adaptation syndrome suggests that stressors tax the body via a three-phase\nprocess\u2014an initial jolt, subsequent readjustment, and a later depletion of all physical resources\u2014that\nultimately lays the groundwork for serious health problems and even death. It should be pointed out,\nhowever, that this model is a response-based conceptualization of stress, focusing exclusively on the\nbody\u2019sphysicalresponseswhilelargelyignoringpsychologicalfactorssuchasappraisalandinterpretation\nofthreats.Nevertheless,Selye\u2019smodelhashadanenormousimpactonthefieldofstressbecauseitoffers\na general explanation for how stress can lead to physical damage and, thus, disease. As we shall discuss\nlater,prolongedorrepeatedstresshasbeenimplicatedindevelopmentofanumberofdisorders suchas\nhypertension and coronary artery disease.\nTHE PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF STRESS\nWhat goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress? The physiological mechanisms of stress\nare extremely complex, but they generally involve the work of two systems\u2014the sympathetic nervous\nsystem and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When a person first perceives something\nas stressful (Selye\u2019s alarm reaction), the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of\nadrenaline from the adrenal glands. Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to\nstress, such as accelerated heart rate and respiration. At the same time, the HPA axis, which is primarily\nendocrineinnature,becomesespeciallyactive,althoughitworksmuchmoreslowlythanthesympathetic\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 497\nnervoussystem.Inresponsetostress,thehypothalamus(oneofthelimbicstructuresinthebrain)releases\ncorticotrophin-releasing factor, a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic\nhormone (ACTH) (Figure 14.11). The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of\nhormonesintothebloodstream;animportantoneiscortisol,whichcanaffectvirtuallyeveryorganwithin\nthebody.Cortisoliscommonlyknownasastresshormoneandhelpsprovidethatboostofenergywhen\nwe first encounter a stressor, preparing us to run away or fight. However, sustained elevated levels of\ncortisol weaken the immune system.\nFigure 14.11 This diagram shows the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The\nhypothalamus activates the pituitary gland, which in turn activates the adrenal glands, increasing their secretion of\ncortisol.\nIn short bursts, this process can have some favorable effects, such as providing extra energy, improving\nimmune system functioning temporarily, and decreasing pain sensitivity. However, extended release of\ncortisol\u2014as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress\u2014often comes at a high price. High levels of\ncortisol have been shown to produce a number of harmful effects. For example, increases in cortisol can\nsignificantly weaken our immune system (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005), and high levels are frequently\nobservedamongdepressedindividuals(Geoffroy,Hertzman,Li,&Power,2013).Insummary,astressful\nevent causes a variety of physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands, which in turn release\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol. These hormones affect a number of bodily processes in ways\nthatpreparethestressedpersontotakedirectaction,butalsoinwaysthatmayheightenthepotentialfor\nillness.\nWhen stress is extreme or chronic, it can have profoundly negative consequences. For example, stress\noften contributes to the development of certain psychological disorders, including post-traumatic stress\ndisorder, major depressive disorder, and other serious psychiatric conditions. Additionally, we noted\nearlier that stress is linked to the development and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and\ndiseases.Forexample,researchersinonestudyfoundthatpeopleinjuredduringtheSeptember11,2001,\nWorld Trade Center disaster or who developed post-traumatic stress symptoms afterward later suffered\nsignificantly elevated rates of heart disease (Jordan, Miller-Archie, Cone, Morabia, & Stellman, 2011).\nAnother investigation yielded that self-reported stress symptoms among aging and retired Finnish food\nindustry workers were associated with morbidity 11 years later. This study also predicted the onset of 498 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nmusculoskeletal, nervous system, and endocrine and metabolic disorders (Salonen, Arola, Nyg\u00e5rd, &\nHuhtala,2008).AnotherstudyreportedthatmaleSouthKoreanmanufacturingemployeeswhoreported\nhighlevelsofwork-relatedstressweremorelikelytocatchthecommoncoldoverthenextseveralmonths\nthan were those employees who reported lower work-related stress levels (Park et al., 2011).

Acute stressors involve brief focal events that sometimes continue to be experienced\nas overwhelming well after the event has ended, such as falling on an icy sidewalk and breaking your\nleg (Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007). Whether chronic or acute, potential stressors come in many\nshapesandsizes.Theycanincludemajor traumatic events,significant lifechanges,dailyhassles, aswell\nas other situations in which a person is regularly exposed to threat, challenge, or danger.\nTRAUMATIC EVENTS\nSomestressorsinvolvetraumaticeventsorsituationsinwhichapersonisexposedtoactualorthreatened\ndeath or serious injury. Stressors in this category include exposure to military combat, threatened or\nactualphysicalassaults(e.g.,physicalattacks,sexualassault,robbery,childhoodabuse),terroristattacks,\nnaturaldisasters (e.g.,earthquakes,floods, hurricanes),andautomobile accidents.

Many potential\nstressors we face involve events or situations that require us to make changes in our ongoing lives and\nrequire time as we adjust to those changes. Examples include death of a close family member, marriage,\ndivorce, and moving (Figure 14.12).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 499\nFigure 14.12 Some fairly typical life events, such as moving, can be significant stressors. Even when the move is\nintentional and positive, the amount of resulting change in daily life can cause stress. (credit: \"Jellaluna\"/Flickr)\nIn the 1960s, psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life\nstressors and physical illness, based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in\na person\u2019s normal life routines are stressful, whether these events are desirable or undesirable. They\ndevelopedtheSocialReadjustmentRatingScale(SRRS),consistingof43lifeeventsthatrequirevarying\ndegrees of personal readjustment (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). Many life events that most people would\nconsider pleasant (e.g., holidays, retirement, marriage) are among those listed on the SRRS; these are\nexamples of eustress. Holmes and Rahe also proposed that life events can add up over time, and that\nexperiencing a cluster of stressful events increases one\u2019s risk of developing physical illnesses.\nIn developing their scale, Holmes and Rahe asked 394 participants to provide a numerical estimate for\neach of the 43 items; each estimate corresponded to how much readjustment participants felt each event\nwould require. These estimates resulted in mean value scores for each event\u2014often called life change\nunits (LCUs) (Rahe, McKeen, & Arthur, 1967). The numerical scores ranged from 11 to 100, representing\nthe perceived magnitude of life change each event entails. Death of a spouse ranked highest on the scale\nwith 100 LCUs, and divorce ranked second highest with 73 LCUs. In addition, personal injury or illness,\nmarriage, and job termination also ranked highly on the scale with 53, 50, and 47 LCUs, respectively.\nConversely, change in residence (20 LCUs), change in eating habits (15 LCUs), and vacation (13 LCUs)\nranked low on the scale (Table 14.1). Minor violations of the law ranked the lowest with 11 LCUs. To\ncomplete the scale, participants checked yes for events experienced within the last 12 months.

A later examination of medical records revealed positive (but small)\ncorrelationsbetweenLCUscorespriortothevoyageandsubsequentillnesssymptomsduringtheensuing\nsix-month journey (Rahe, 1974).

Perhaps the most serious criticism is that the scale does\nnot take into consideration respondents\u2019 appraisals of the life events it contains. As you recall, appraisal\nof a stressor is a key element in the conceptualization and overall experience of stress.

Daily hassles\u2014the minor irritations and\nannoyances that are part of our everyday lives (e.g., rush hour traffic, lost keys, obnoxious coworkers,\ninclement weather, arguments with friends or family)\u2014can build on one another and leave us just as\nstressed as life change events (Figure 14.13) (Kanner, Coyne, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1981).\nFigure 14.13 Daily commutes, whether (a) on the road or (b) via public transportation, can be hassles that\ncontribute to our feelings of everyday stress. (credit a: modification of work by Jeff Turner; credit b: modification of\nwork by \"epSos.de\"/Flickr)\nResearchers have demonstrated that the frequency of daily hassles is actually a better predictor of both\nphysical and psychological health than are life change units. In a well-known study of San Francisco\nresidents, the frequency of daily hassles was found to be more strongly associated with physical health\nproblemsthanwerelifechangeevents(DeLongis,Coyne,Dakof,Folkman,&Lazarus,1982).Inaddition,\ndaily minor hassles, especially interpersonal conflicts, often lead to negative and distressed mood states\n(Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, & Schilling, 1989). Cyber hassles that occur on social media may represent a\nnew source of stress. In one investigation, undergraduates who, over a 10-week period, reported greater\nFacebook-inducedstress(e.g.,guiltordiscomfortoverrejectingfriendrequestsandangerorsadnessover\nbeingunfriendedbyanother)experiencedincreasedratesofupperrespiratoryinfections,especiallyifthey 502 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nhad larger social networks (Campisi et al., 2012). Clearly, daily hassles can add up and take a toll on us\nboth emotionally and physically.\nOTHER STRESSORS\nStressorscanincludesituationsinwhichoneisfrequentlyexposedtochallengingandunpleasantevents,\nsuch as difficult, demanding, or unsafe working conditions. Although most jobs and occupations can\nat times be demanding, some are clearly more stressful than others (Figure 14.14).

A longitudinal study of over 10,000 British civil servants reported that\nworkersunder50yearsoldwhoearlierhadreportedhighjobstrainwere68%morelikelytolaterdevelop\nheart disease than were those workers under 50 years old who reported little job strain (Chandola et al.,\n2008).\nSome people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout,\nwhich is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one\u2019s job (Maslach &\nJackson, 1981). Job burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs (e.g., social workers,\nteachers, therapists, and police officers). Job burnout consists of three dimensions. The first dimension is\nexhaustion\u2014asensethatone\u2019semotionalresourcesaredrainedorthatoneisattheendofherropeandhas\nnothingmoretogiveatapsychological level.Second, job burnoutischaracterized bydepersonalization:\na sense of emotional detachment between the worker and the recipients of his services, often resulting\nin callous, cynical, or indifferent attitudes toward these individuals.

In addition, depression often co-\noccurs with job burnout. One large-scale study of over 3,000 Finnish employees reported that half of the\nparticipantswithseverejobburnouthadsomeformofdepressivedisorder(Aholaetal.,2005).Jobburnout\nis often precipitated by feelings of having invested considerable energy, effort, and time into one\u2019s work\nwhile receiving little in return (e.g., little respect or support from others or low pay) (Tatris, Peeters, Le\nBlanc, Schreurs, & Schaufeli, 2001).\nAs an illustration, consider CharlieAnn, a nursing assistant who worked in a nursing home. CharlieAnn 504 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nworked long hours for little pay in a difficult facility. Her supervisor was domineering, unpleasant, and\nunsupportive; he was disrespectful of CharlieAnn\u2019s personal time, frequently informing her at the last\nminute she must work several additional hours after her shift ended or that she must report to work on\nweekends.CharlieAnnhadverylittleautonomyatherjob.Shehadlittlesayinherday-to-daydutiesand\nhow to perform them, and she was not permitted to take breaks unless hersupervisor explicitly told her\nthat she could. CharlieAnn did not feel as though her hard work was appreciated, either by supervisory\nstaff or by the residents of the home. She was very unhappy over her low pay, and she felt that many of\nthe residents treated her disrespectfully.\nAfter several years, CharlieAnn began to hate her job.

All of these can\nbe overwhelming, threatening to the relationship, and thus stressful. Such stressors can take a toll both\nemotionally and physically. A longitudinal investigation of over 9,000 British civil servants found that\nthosewhoatonepointhadreportedthehighestlevelsofnegativeinteractionsintheirclosestrelationship\nwere 34% more likely to experience serious heart problems (fatal or nonfatal heart attacks) over a 13\u201315\nyear period, compared to those who experienced the lowest levels of negative interaction (De Vogli,\nChandola & Marmot, 2007).\n14.3 Stress and Illness\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the nature of psychophysiological disorders\n\u2022 Describe the immune system and how stress impacts its functioning\n\u2022 Describe how stress and emotional factors can lead to the development and exacerbation of\ncardiovascular disorders, asthma, and tension headaches\nIn this section, we will discussstressand illness.

Also, someone exposed to high levels of the stress\nhormone cortisol might become vulnerable to infection or disease because of weakened immune system\nfunctioning (McEwen, 1998).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRobert Sapolsky, a noted Stanford University neurobiologist and professor, has for\nover 30 years conducted extensive research on stress, its impact on our bodies, and\nhow psychological tumult can escalate stress\u2014even in baboons. Here are two\nvideos featuring Dr. Sapolsky: one is regardingkiller stress\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sapolsky1)and the other is an excellentin-depth\ndocumentary (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sapolsky2)fromNational Geographic.\nPhysical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional\nfactors are called psychophysiological disorders. The physical symptoms of psychophysiological\ndisorders are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors (hence the psycho\nandphysiological inpsychophysiological). Alistoffrequentlyencountered psychophysiological disorders\nis provided inTable 14.3.\nTable 14.3Types of Psychophysiological Disorders (adapted from Everly &\nLating, 2002)\nType of Psychophysiological Disorder Examples\nCardiovascular hypertension, coronary heart disease\nGastrointestinal irritable bowel syndrome\nRespiratory asthma, allergy\nMusculoskeletal low back pain, tension headaches\nSkin acne, eczema, psoriasis\nIn addition to stress itself, emotional upset and certain stressful personality traits have been proposed\nas potential contributors to ill health. Franz Alexander (1950), an early-20th-century psychoanalyst and\nphysician,oncepostulatedthatvariousdiseasesarecausedbyspecificunconsciousconflicts.Forexample,\nhe linked hypertension to repressed anger, asthma to separation anxiety, and ulcers to an unconscious 506 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\ndesireto\u201cremaininthedependentinfantilesituation\u2014tobelovedandcaredfor\u201d(Alexander,1950,p.102).\nAlthoughhypertensiondoesappeartobelinkedtoanger(asyouwilllearnbelow),Alexander\u2019sassertions\nhave not been supported by research. Years later, Friedman and Booth-Kewley (1987), after statistically\nreviewing 101 studies examining the link between personality and illness, proposed the existence of\ndisease-prone personality characteristics, including depression, anger/hostility, and anxiety. Indeed, a\nstudyofover61,000Norwegiansidentifieddepressionasariskfactorforallmajordisease-relatedcauses\nof death (Mykletun et al., 2007). In addition, neuroticism\u2014a personality trait that reflects how anxious,\nmoody, and sad one is\u2014has been identified as a risk factor for chronic health problems and mortality\n(Ploubidis & Grundy, 2009).\nBelow, we discuss two kinds of psychophysiological disorders about which a great deal is known:\ncardiovasculardisordersandasthma.First,however,itisnecessarytoturnourattentiontoadiscussionof\nthe immune system\u2014one of the major pathways through which stress and emotional factors can lead to\nillness and disease.\nSTRESS AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\nInasense,theimmunesystemisthebody\u2019ssurveillancesystem.Itconsistsofavarietyofstructures,cells,\nand mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading toxins and microorganisms that can harm\nor damage the body\u2019s tissues and organs. When the immune system is working as it should, it keeps us\nhealthy and disease free by eliminating bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances that have entered\nthe body (Everly & Lating, 2002).\nImmune System Errors\nSometimes, the immune system will function erroneously. For example, sometimes it can go awry by\nmistakingyourbody\u2019sownhealthycellsforinvadersandrepeatedlyattackingthem.Whenthishappens,\nthe person is said to have an autoimmune disease, which can affect almost any part of the body. How\nan autoimmune disease affects a person depends on what part of the body is targeted. For instance,\nrheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints, results in joint pain, stiffness, and\nlossoffunction.Systemiclupuserythematosus,anautoimmunediseasethataffectstheskin,canresultin\nrashesandswellingoftheskin.Grave\u2019sdisease,anautoimmunediseasethataffectsthethyroidgland,can\nresult in fatigue, weight gain, and muscle aches (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and\nSkin Diseases [NIAMS], 2012).\nIn addition, the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job. This situation\nis referred to as immunosuppression, the decreased effectiveness of the immune system. When people\nexperience immunosuppression, they become susceptible to any number of infections, illness, and\ndiseases.Forexample,acquiredimmunedeficiencysyndrome(AIDS)isaseriousandlethaldiseasethatis\ncausedbyhumanimmunodeficiencyvirus(HIV),whichgreatlyweakenstheimmunesystembyinfecting\nand destroying antibody-producing cells, thus rendering a person vulnerable to any of a number of\nopportunistic infections (Powell, 1996).\nStressors and Immune Function\nThe question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has\ncaptivated researchers for over three decades, and discoveries made over that time have dramatically\nchanged the face of health psychology (Kiecolt-Glaser, 2009). Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that\nstudies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning.\nThe term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981, when it appeared as the title of a book that\nreviewed available evidence for associations between the brain, endocrine system, and immune system\n(Zacharie,2009).Toalargeextent,thisfieldevolvedfromthediscoverythatthereisaconnectionbetween\nthe central nervous system and the immune system.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 507\nSome of the most compelling evidence for a connection between the brain and the immune system\ncomes from studies in which researchers demonstrated that immune responses in animals could be\nclassically conditioned (Everly & Lating, 2002). For example, Ader and Cohen (1975) paired flavored\nwater(theconditionedstimulus)withthepresentationofanimmunosuppressivedrug(theunconditioned\nstimulus), causing sickness (an unconditioned response). Not surprisingly, rats exposed to this pairing\ndeveloped a conditioned aversion to the flavored water. However, the taste of the water itself later\nproduced immunosuppression (a conditioned response), indicating that the immune system itself had\nbeen conditioned. Many subsequent studies over the years have further demonstrated that immune\nresponses can be classically conditioned in both animals and humans (Ader & Cohen, 2001). Thus, if\nclassical conditioning can alter immunity, other psychological factors should be capable of altering it as\nwell.\nHundreds of studies involving tens of thousands of participants have tested many kinds of brief and\nchronic stressors and their effect on the immune system (e.g., public speaking, medical school\nexaminations, unemployment, marital discord, divorce, death of spouse, burnout and job strain, caring\nfor a relative with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and exposure to the harsh climate of Antarctica). It has been\nrepeatedly demonstrated that many kinds of stressors are associated with poor or weakened immune\nfunctioning(Glaser&Kiecolt-Glaser,2005;Kiecolt-Glaser,McGuire,Robles,&Glaser,2002;Segerstrom&\nMiller, 2004).\nWhen evaluating these findings, it is important to remember that there is a tangible physiological\nconnection between the brain and the immune system. For example, the sympathetic nervous system\ninnervates immune organs such as the thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and even lymph nodes (Maier,\nWatkins, & Fleshner, 1994). Also, we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation can adversely impact immune function. One way they do this is\nbyinhibitingtheproductionoflymphocytes,whitebloodcellsthatcirculateinthebody\u2019sfluidsthatare\nimportant in the immune response (Everly & Lating, 2002).\nSome of the more dramatic examples demonstrating the link between stress and impaired immune\nfunction involve studies inwhichvolunteers wereexposed toviruses. Therationalebehindthisresearch\nis that because stress weakens the immune system, people with high stress levels should be more likely\nto develop an illness compared to those under little stress. In one memorable experiment using this\nmethod, researchers interviewed 276 healthy volunteers about recent stressful experiences (Cohen et al.,\n1998). Following the interview, these participants were given nasal drops containing the cold virus (in\ncase you are wondering why anybody would ever want to participate in a study in which they are\nsubjected to such treatment, the participants were paid $800 for their trouble). When examined later,\nparticipants who reported experiencing chronic stressors for more than one month\u2014especially enduring\ndifficultiesinvolvingworkorrelationships\u2014wereconsiderablymorelikelytohavedevelopedcoldsthan\nwere participants who reported no chronic stressors (Figure 14.15). 508 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.15 This graph shows the percentages of participants who developed colds (after receiving the cold virus)\nafter reporting having experienced chronic stressors lasting at least one month, three months, and six months\n(adapted from Cohen et al., 1998).\nInanotherstudy,oldervolunteersweregivenaninfluenzavirusvaccination.Comparedtocontrols,those\nwho were caring for a spouse with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (and thus were under chronic stress) showed\npoorer antibody response following the vaccination (Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser, Gravenstein, Malarkey, &\nSheridan, 1996).\nOtherstudieshavedemonstratedthatstressslowsdownwoundhealingbyimpairingimmuneresponses\nimportant to wound repair (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005). In one study, for example, skin blisters were\ninduced on the forearm. Subjects who reported higher levels of stress produced lower levels of immune\nproteinsnecessaryforwoundhealing(Glaseretal.,1999).Stress,then,isnotsomuchtheswordthatkills\ntheknight,sotospeak;rather,it\u2019stheswordthatbreakstheknight\u2019sshield,andyourimmunesystemis\nthat shield.\nDIG DEEPER\nStress and Aging: A Tale of Telomeres\nHave you ever wondered why people who are stressed often seem to have a haggard look about them? A\npioneeringstudyfrom2004suggeststhatthereasonisbecausestresscanactuallyacceleratethecellbiology\nof aging.\nStress,itseems,canshortentelomeres,whicharesegmentsofDNAthatprotecttheendsofchromosomes.\nShortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division, which includes growth and proliferation of new cells,\nthereby leading to more rapid aging (Sapolsky, 2004). In the study, researchers compared telomere lengths\nin the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children (Epel\net al., 2004). Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would\nmothers of healthy children. The longer a mother had spent caring for her ill child, the shorter her telomeres\n(the correlation between years of caregiving and telomere length was r = -.40). In addition, higher levels of\nperceived stress were negatively correlated with telomere size (r = -.31). These researchers also found that\ntheaveragetelomerelengthofthemoststressedmothers,comparedtotheleaststressed,wassimilartowhat\nyou would find in people who were 9\u201317 years older than they were on average.\nNumerous other studies since have continued to find associations between stress and eroded telomeres\n(Blackburn & Epel, 2012). Some studies have even demonstrated that stress can begin to erode telomeres\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 509\nin childhood and perhaps even before children are born. For example, childhood exposure to violence (e.g.,\nmaternal domestic violence, bullying victimization, and physical maltreatment) was found in one study to\nacceleratetelomereerosionfromages5to10(Shalevetal.,2013).Anotherstudyreportedthatyoungadults\nwhose mothers had experienced severe stress during their pregnancy had shorter telomeres than did those\nwhose mothers had stress-free and uneventful pregnancies (Entringer et al., 2011). Further, the corrosive\neffects of childhood stress on telomeres can extend into young adulthood. In an investigation of over 4,000\nU.K.womenages41\u201380,adverseexperiencesduringchildhood(e.g.,physicalabuse,beingsentawayfrom\nhome,andparentdivorce)wereassociatedwithshortenedtelomerelength(Surteesetal.,2010),andtelomere\nsize decreased as the amount of experienced adversity increased (Figure 14.16).\nFigure 14.16 Telomeres are shorter in adults who experienced more trauma as children (adapted from\nBlackburn & Epel, 2012).\nEfforts to dissect the precise cellular and physiological mechanisms linking short telomeres to stress and\ndiseasearecurrentlyunderway.Forthetimebeing,telomeresprovideuswithyetanotherreminderthatstress,\nespecially during early life, can be just as harmful to our health as smoking or fast food (Blackburn & Epel,\n2012).\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\nThe cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system.

The pain often feels like the chest is being pressed or\nsqueezed; burning sensations in the chest and shortness of breath are also commonly reported. Such\npain and discomfort can spread to the arms, neck, jaws, stomach (as nausea), and back (American Heart\nAssociation [AHA], 2012a) (Figure 14.17). 510 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.17 Males and females often experience different symptoms of a heart attack.\nA major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension, which is high blood pressure. Hypertension forces\na person\u2019s heart to pump harder, thus putting more physical strain on the heart. If left unchecked,\nhypertension can lead to a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure; it can also lead to kidney failure and\nblindness. Hypertension is a serious cardiovascular disorder, and it is sometimes called the silent killer\nbecauseithasnosymptoms\u2014onewhohashighbloodpressuremaynotevenbeawareofit(AHA,2012b).\nManyriskfactorscontributingtocardiovasculardisordershavebeenidentified.Theseriskfactorsinclude\nsocial determinants such as aging, income, education, and employment status, as well as behavioral risk\nfactors that include unhealthy diet, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption;\nobesity and diabetes are additional risk factors (World Health Organization [WHO], 2013).\nOver the past few decades, there has been much greater recognition and awareness of the importance\nof stress and other psychological factors in cardiovascular health (Nusair, Al-dadah, & Kumar, 2012).\nIndeed, exposure to stressors of many kinds has also been linked to cardiovascular problems; in the\ncase of hypertension, some of these stressors include job strain (Trudel, Brisson, & Milot, 2010), natural\ndisasters(Saito,Kim,Maekawa,Ikeda,&Yokoyama,1997),maritalconflict(Nealey-Moore,Smith,Uchino,\nHawkins, & Olson-Cerny, 2007), and exposure to high traffic noise levels at one\u2019s home (de Kluizenaar,\nGansevoort, Miedema, & de Jong, 2007). Perceived discrimination appears to be associated with\nhypertensionamongAfricanAmericans(Simsetal.,2012).Inaddition,laboratory-basedstresstasks,such\nas performing mental arithmetic under time pressure, immersing one\u2019s hand into ice water (known as\nthe cold pressor test), mirror tracing, and public speaking have allbeen shown to elevate blood pressure\n(Phillips, 2011).\nARE YOU TYPE A OR TYPE B?\nSometimes research ideas and theories emerge from seemingly trivial observations.

If so, how?\nAfterresearchingthismatter,Friedmanandhiscolleague,RayRosenman,cametounderstandthatpeople\nwho are prone to heart disease tend to think, feel, and act differently than those who are not. These\nindividuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always\nseem to be in a rush. According to Friedman and Rosenman, these individuals exhibit Type A behavior\npattern; those who are more relaxed and laid-back were characterized as Type B (Figure 14.18). In a\nsampleofTypeAsandTypeBs,FriedmanandRosenmanwerestartledtodiscoverthatheartdiseasewas\nover seven times more frequent among the Type As than the Type Bs (Friedman & Rosenman, 1959).\nFigure 14.18 (a) Type A individuals are characterized as intensely driven, (b) while Type B people are characterized\nas laid-back and relaxed.

When Jeffrey was 52, he suffered his first heart\nattack.\nBythe1970s,amajorityofpracticingcardiologistsbelievedthatTypeAbehaviorpatternwasasignificant\nrisk factor for heart disease (Friedman, 1977). Indeed, a number of early longitudinal investigations\ndemonstratedalinkbetweenTypeAbehaviorpatternandlaterdevelopmentofheartdisease(Rosenman\net al., 1975; Haynes, Feinleib, & Kannel, 1980).\nSubsequent research examining the association between Type A and heart disease, however, failed to\nreplicate these earlier findings (Glassman, 2007; Myrtek, 2001). Because Type A theory did not pan out\nas well as they had hoped, researchers shifted their attention toward determining if any of the specific\nelements of Type A predict heart disease.\nExtensive research clearly suggests that the anger/hostility dimension of Type A behavior pattern may\nbe one of the most important factors in the development of heart disease. This relationship was initially\ndescribed in the Haynes et al. (1980) study mentioned above: Suppressed hostility was found to\nsubstantially elevate the risk of heart disease for both men and women. Also, one investigation followed 512 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nover1,000malemedicalstudentsfrom32to48years.Atthebeginningofthestudy,thesemencompleted\na questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure; some indicated that they respond with high levels\nof anger, whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger. Decades later, researchers found\nthatthosewhoearlierhadindicated thehighestlevelsofangerwereover6timesmorelikelythanthose\nwho indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age 55, and they were 3.5 times more likely to\nhaveexperiencedheartdiseasebythesameage(Chang,Ford,Meoni,Wang,&Klag,2002).Fromahealth\nstandpoint, it clearly does not pay to be an angry young person.\nAfter reviewing and statistically summarizing 35 studies from 1983 to 2006, Chida and Steptoe (2009)\nconcludedthatthebulkoftheevidencesuggeststhatangerandhostilityconstituteseriouslong-termrisk\nfactorsforadversecardiovascularoutcomesamongbothhealthyindividualsandthosealreadysuffering\nfrom heart disease. One reason angry and hostile moods might contribute to cardiovascular diseases is\nthatsuchmoodscancreatesocialstrain,mainlyintheformofantagonisticsocialencounterswithothers.\nThis strain could then lay the foundation for disease-promoting cardiovascular responses among hostile\nindividuals(Vella,Kamarck,Flory,&Manuck,2012).Inthistransactionalmodel,hostilityandsocialstrain\nform a cycle (Figure 14.19).\nFigure 14.19 According to the transactional model of hostility for predicting social interactions (Vella et al., 2012),\nthe thoughts and feelings of a hostile person promote antagonistic behavior toward others, which in turn reinforces\ncomplimentary reactions from others, thereby intensifying ones\u2019 hostile disposition and intensifying the cyclical nature\nof this relationship.\nForexample,supposeKaitlinhasahostiledisposition;shehasacynical,distrustfulattitudetowardothers\nandoftenthinksthatotherpeopleareouttogether.Sheisverydefensivearoundpeople,eventhoseshe\nhas known for years, and she is always looking for signs that others are either disrespecting or belittling\nher.Intheshowereachmorningbeforework,sheoftenmentallyrehearseswhatshewouldsaytosomeone\nwho said or did something that angered her, such as making a political statement that was counter to\nher own ideology.

As you might imagine, Kaitlin is not\nespecially popular with others, including coworkers, neighbors, and even members of her own family.\nThey either avoid her at all costs or snap back at her, which causes Kaitlin to become even more cynical\nand distrustful of others, making herdisposition even more hostile. Kaitlin\u2019s hostility\u2014through herown\ndoing\u2014has created an antagonistic environment that cyclically causes her to become even more hostile\nand angry, thereby potentially setting the stage for cardiovascular problems.\nIn addition to anger and hostility, a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with\nheart disease, including negative affectivity and depression (Suls & Bunde, 2005). Negative affectivity\nis a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear,\nand nervousness (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). It has been linked with the development of both\nhypertension and heart disease. For example, over 3,000 initially healthy participants in one study were\ntrackedlongitudinally,upto22years.Thosewithhigherlevelsofnegativeaffectivityatthetimethestudy\nbeganweresubstantiallymorelikelytodevelopandbetreatedforhypertensionduringtheensuingyears\nthanwerethosewithlowerlevelsofnegativeaffectivity(Jonas&Lando,2000).Inaddition,astudyofover\n10,000middle-agedLondon-basedcivilservantswhowerefollowedanaverageof12.5yearsrevealedthat\nthose who earlier had scored in the upper third on a test of negative affectivity were 32% more likely to\nhaveexperiencedheartdisease,heartattack,oranginaoveraperiodofyearsthanwerethosewhoscored\ninthelowestthird(Nabi,Kivimaki,DeVogli,Marmot,&Singh-Manoux,2008).Hence,negativeaffectivity\nappears to be a potentially vital risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disorders.\nDEPRESSION AND THE HEART\nFor centuries, poets and folklore have asserted that there is a connection between moods and the heart\n(Glassman & Shapiro, 1998). You are no doubt familiar with the notion of a broken heart following a\ndisappointing or depressing event and have encountered that notion in songs, films, and literature.\nPerhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg\n(1937), who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia (an archaic\nterm for depression) was six times higher than that of the population. A classic study in the late 1970s\nlookedatover8,000manic-depressivepersonsinDenmark,findinganearly50%increaseindeathsfrom\nheart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population (Weeke, 1979). By the\nearly 1990s, evidence began to accumulate showing that depressed individuals who were followed for\nlong periods of time were at increased risk for heart disease and cardiac death (Glassman, 2007). In one\ninvestigation of over 700 Denmark residents, those with the highest depression scores were 71% more\nlikelytohaveexperiencedaheartattackthanwerethosewithlowerdepressionscores(Barefoot&Schroll,\n1996).Figure 14.20illustrates the gradation in risk of heart attacks for both men and women. 514 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.20 This graph shows the incidence of heart attacks among men and women by depression score quartile\n(adapted from Barefoot & Schroll, 1996).\nAfter more than two decades of research, it is now clear that a relationship exists: Patients with heart\ndiseasehavemoredepressionthanthegeneralpopulation,andpeoplewithdepressionaremorelikelyto\neventuallydevelopheartdiseaseandexperiencehighermortalitythanthosewhodonothavedepression\n(Hare, Toukhsati, Johansson, & Jaarsma, 2013); the more severe the depression, the higher the risk\n(Glassman, 2007). Consider the following:\n\u2022 In one study, death rates from cardiovascular problems was substantially higher in depressed\npeople; depressed men were 50% more likely to have died from cardiovascular problems, and\ndepressed women were 70% more likely (\u00d6sby, Brandt, Correia, Ekbom, & Spar\u00e9n, 2001).\n\u2022 A statistical review of 10 longitudinal studies involving initially healthy individuals revealed that\nthosewithelevateddepressivesymptomshave,onaverage,a64%greaterriskofdevelopingheart\ndisease than do those with fewer symptoms (Wulsin & Singal, 2003).\n\u2022 Astudyofover63,000registerednursesfoundthatthosewithmoredepressedsymptomswhenthe\nstudybeganwere49%morelikelytoexperiencefatalheartdiseaseovera12-yearperiod(Whanget\nal., 2009).\nThe American Heart Association, fully aware of the established importance of depression in\ncardiovasculardiseases,severalyearsagorecommendedroutinedepressionscreeningforallheartdisease\npatients(Lichtmanetal.,2008).Recently,theyhaverecommendedincludingdepressionasariskfactorfor\nheart disease patients (AHA, 2014).\nAlthoughtheexactmechanismsthroughwhichdepressionmightproduceheartproblemshavenotbeen\nfully clarified, a recent investigation examining this connection in early life has shed some light. In an\nongoingstudyofchildhooddepression,adolescentswhohadbeendiagnosedwithdepressionaschildren\nweremorelikelytobeobese,smoke,andbephysicallyinactivethanwerethosewhohadnotreceivedthis\ndiagnosis (Rottenbergetal.,2014).Oneimplication ofthisstudyisthatdepression, especiallyifitoccurs\nearlyinlife,mayincreasethelikelihoodoflivinganunhealthylifestyle,therebypredisposingpeopletoan\nunfavorable cardiovascular disease risk profile.\nIt is important to point out that depression may be just one piece of the emotional puzzle in elevating\nthe risk for heart disease, and that chronically experiencing several negative emotional states may be\nespecially important. A longitudinal investigation of Vietnam War veterans found that depression,\nanxiety,hostility,andtraitangereachindependentlypredictedtheonsetofheartdisease(Boyle,Michalek,\n& Suarez, 2006). However, when each of these negative psychological attributes was combined into a\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 515\nsingle variable, this new variable (which researchers called psychological risk factor) predicted heart\ndisease more strongly than any of the individual variables. Thus, rather than examining the predictive\npower of isolated psychological risk factors, it seems crucial for future researchers to examine the effects\nof combined and more general negative emotional and psychological traits in the development of\ncardiovascular illnesses.\nASTHMA\nAsthmaisachronicandseriousdiseaseinwhichtheairwaysoftherespiratorysystembecomeobstructed,\nleadingtogreatdifficultyexpellingairfromthelungs.Theairwayobstructioniscausedbyinflammation\nof the airways (leading to thickening of the airway walls) and a tightening of the muscles around them,\nresulting in a narrowing of the airways (Figure 14.21) (American Lung Association, 2010). Because\nairwaysbecomeobstructed,apersonwithasthmawillsometimeshavegreatdifficultybreathingandwill\nexperience repeated episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing, the latter\noccurring mostly during the morning and night (CDC, 2006).\nFigure 14.21 In asthma, the airways become inflamed and narrowed.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 4,000 people die each year\nfrom asthma-related causes, and asthma is a contributing factor to another 7,000 deaths each year (CDC,\n2013a). The CDC has revealed that asthma affects 18.7 million U.S. adults and is more common among\npeople with lower education and income levels (CDC, 2013b). Especially concerning is that asthma is on\nthe rise, with rates of asthma increasing 157% between 2000 and 2010 (CDC, 2013b).\nAsthma attacks are acute episodes in which an asthma sufferer experiences the full range of symptoms.\nAsthma exacerbation is often triggered by environmental factors, such as air pollution, allergens (e.g.,\npollen, mold, and pet hairs), cigarette smoke, airway infections, cold air or a sudden change in\ntemperature, and exercise (CDC, 2013b).\nPsychological factors appear to play an important role in asthma (Wright, Rodriguez, & Cohen, 1998), 516 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nalthough some believe that psychological factors serve as potential triggers in only a subset of asthma\npatients (Ritz, Steptoe, Bobb, Harris, & Edwards, 2006). Many studies over the years have demonstrated\nthat some people with asthma will experience asthma-like symptoms if they expect to experience such\nsymptoms, such as when breathing an inert substance that they (falsely) believe will lead to airway\nobstruction (Sodergren & Hyland, 1999). As stress and emotions directly affect immune and respiratory\nfunctions, psychological factors likely serve as one of the most common triggers of asthma exacerbation\n(Trueba & Ritz, 2013).\nPeople with asthma tend to report and display a high level of negative emotions such as anxiety, and\nasthma attacks have been linked to periods of high emotionality (Lehrer, Isenberg, & Hochron, 1993). In\naddition, high levels of emotional distress during both laboratory tasks and daily life have been found\nto negatively affect airway function and can produce asthma-like symptoms in people with asthma (von\nLeupoldt, Ehnes, & Dahme, 2006). In one investigation, 20 adults with asthma wore preprogrammed\nwristwatchesthatsignaledthemtobreatheintoaportabledevicethatmeasuresairwayfunction.Results\nshowed that higher levels of negative emotions and stress were associated with increased airway\nobstruction and self-reported asthma symptoms (Smyth, Soefer, Hurewitz, Kliment, & Stone, 1999). In\naddition, D\u2019Amato, Liccardi, Cecchi, Pellegrino, & D\u2019Amato (2010) described a case study of an 18-year-\noldmanwithasthmawhosegirlfriendhadbrokenupwithhim,leavinghiminadepressedstate.Shehad\nalso unfriended him on Facebook , while friending other young males.

Thiscasesuggests thattheuseofFacebook and\notherformsofsocialmediamayrepresentanewsourceofstress\u2014itmaybeatriggeringfactorforasthma\nattacks, especially in depressed asthmatic individuals.\nExposure to stressful experiences, particularly those that involve parental or interpersonal conflicts, has\nbeen linked to the development of asthma throughout the lifespan. A longitudinal study of 145 children\nfoundthatparentingdifficultiesduringthefirstyearoflifeincreasedthechancesthatthechilddeveloped\nasthma by 107% (Klinnert et al., 2001). In addition, a cross-sectional study of over 10,000 Finnish college\nstudents found that high rates of parent or personal conflicts (e.g., parental divorce, separation from\nspouse,orsevereconflictsinotherlong-termrelationships)increasedtheriskofasthmaonset(Kilpel\u00e4inen,\nKoskenvuo, Helenius, & Terho, 2002). Further, a study of over 4,000 middle-aged men who were\ninterviewed in the early 1990s and again a decade later found that breaking off an important life\npartnership (e.g., divorce or breaking off relationship from parents) increased the risk of developing\nasthma by 124% over the time of the study (Loerbroks, Apfelbacher, Thayer, Debling, & St\u00fcrmer, 2009).\nTENSION HEADACHES\nA headache is a continuous pain anywhere in the head and neck region. Migraine headaches are a type\nof headache thought to be caused by blood vessel swelling and increased blood flow (McIntosh, 2013).\nMigraines are characterized by severe pain on one or both sides of the head, an upset stomach, and\ndisturbed vision. They are more frequently experienced by women than by men (American Academy\nof Neurology, 2014). Tension headaches are triggered by tightening/tensing of facial and neck muscles;\nthey are the most commonly experienced kind of headache, accounting for about 42% of all headaches\nworldwide (Stovner et al., 2007). In the United States, well over one-third of the population experiences\ntension headaches each year, and 2\u20133% of the population suffers from chronic tension headaches\n(Schwartz, Stewart, Simon, & Lipton, 1998).\nAnumberoffactorscancontributetotensionheadaches,includingsleepdeprivation,skippingmeals,eye\nstrain,overexertion, muscular tensioncaused bypoorposture,andstress (MedicineNet, 2013).Although\nthereisuncertaintyregardingtheexactmechanismsthroughwhichstresscanproducetensionheadaches,\nstress has been demonstrated to increase sensitivity to pain (Caceres & Burns, 1997; Logan et al., 2001).\nIngeneral,tensionheadachesufferers,comparedtonon-sufferers,havealowerthresholdforandgreater\nsensitivity to pain (Ukestad & Wittrock, 1996), and they report greater levels of subjective stress when\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 517\nfacedwithastressor(Myers,Wittrock,&Foreman,1998).Thus,stressmaycontributetotensionheadaches\nbyincreasingpainsensitivityinalready-sensitivepainpathwaysintensionheadachesufferers(Cathcart,\nPetkov, & Pritchard, 2008).\n14.4 Regulation of Stress\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define coping and differentiate between problem-focused and emotion-focused coping\n\u2022 Describe the importance of perceived control in our reactions to stress\n\u2022 Explain how social support is vital in health and longevity\nAswelearnedintheprevioussection,stress\u2014especiallyifitischronic\u2014takesatollonourbodiesandcan\nhave enormously negative health implications. When we experience events in our lives that we appraise\nas stressful, it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress. Coping refers to\nmentalandbehavioraleffortsthatweusetodealwithproblemsrelatingtostress,includingitspresumed\ncause and the unpleasant feelings and emotions it produces.\nCOPING STYLES\nLazarus and Folkman (1984) distinguished two fundamental kinds of coping: problem-focused coping\nand emotion-focused coping. In problem-focused coping, one attempts to manage or alter the problem\nthatiscausingonetoexperiencestress(i.e.,thestressor).Problem-focusedcopingstrategiesaresimilarto\nstrategies usedineveryday problem-solving: theytypicallyinvolve identifyingtheproblem, considering\npossible solutions, weighing the costs and benefits of these solutions, and then selecting an alternative\n(Lazarus&Folkman,1984).Asanexample,supposeBradfordreceivesamidtermnoticethatheisfailing\nstatisticsclass.IfBradfordadoptsaproblem-focusedcopingapproachtomanaginghisstress,hewouldbe\nproactiveintryingtoalleviatethesourceofthestress.Hemightcontacthisprofessortodiscusswhatmust\nbedonetoraisehisgrade,hemightalsodecidetosetasidetwohoursdailytostudystatisticsassignments,\nandhemayseektutoringassistance.Aproblem-focusedapproachtomanagingstressmeansweactively\ntry to do things to address the problem.\nEmotion-focused coping, in contrast, consists of efforts to change or reduce the negative emotions\nassociated with stress. These efforts may include avoiding, minimizing, or distancing oneself from the\nproblem,orpositivecomparisonswithothers(\u201cI\u2019mnotasbadoffassheis\u201d),orseekingsomethingpositive\nin a negative event (\u201cNow that I\u2019ve been fired, I can sleep in for a few days\u201d). In some cases, emotion-\nfocusedcopingstrategiesinvolvereappraisal,wherebythestressorisconstrueddifferently(andsomewhat\nself-deceptively) without changing its objective level of threat (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). For example,\na person sentenced to federal prison who thinks, \u201cThis will give me a great chance to network with\nothers,\u201disusingreappraisal.IfBradfordadoptedanemotion-focusedapproachtomanaginghismidterm\ndeficiency stress, he might watch a comedy movie, play video games, or spend hours on Twitter to take\nhis mind off the situation. In a certain sense, emotion-focused coping can be thought of as treating the\nsymptoms rather than the actual cause.\nWhile many stressors elicit both kinds of coping strategies, problem-focused coping is more likely to\noccur when encountering stressors we perceive as controllable, while emotion-focused coping is more\nlikelytopredominatewhenfacedwithstressorsthatwebelievewearepowerlesstochange(Folkman&\nLazarus,1980).Clearly,emotion-focusedcopingismoreeffectiveindealingwithuncontrollablestressors.\nForexample,ifatmidnightyouarestressingovera40-pagepaperdueinthemorningthatyouhavenot\nyetstarted,youareprobablybetteroffrecognizingthehopelessnessofthesituationanddoingsomething\ntotakeyourmindoffit;takingaproblem-focusedapproachbytryingtoaccomplishthistaskwouldonly 518 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nlead to frustration, anxiety, and even more stress.\nFortunately, most stressors we encounter can be modified and are, to varying degrees, controllable.

Albert Bandura (1997) stated\nthat \u201cthe intensity and chronicity of human stress is governed largely by perceived control over the\ndemandsofone\u2019slife\u201d(p.262).Ascogentlydescribedinhisstatement,ourreactiontopotentialstressors\ndepends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things. Perceived control\nis our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes, and it has major\nimplicationsforourhealthandhappiness(Infurna&Gerstorf,2014).Extensiveresearchhasdemonstrated\nthat perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes, such as better\nphysical and mental health and greater psychological well-being (Diehl & Hay, 2010). Greater personal\ncontrol is also associated with lower reactivity to stressors in daily life. For example, researchers in one\ninvestigation found that higher levels of perceived control at one point in time were later associated\nwith lower emotional and physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors (Neupert, Almeida, & Charles,\n2007). Further, a daily diary study with 34 older widows found that their stress and anxiety levels were\nsignificantlyreducedondaysduringwhichthewidowsfeltgreaterperceivedcontrol(Ong,Bergeman,&\nBisconti, 2005).\nDIG DEEPER\nLearned Helplessness\nWhenwelackasenseofcontrolovertheeventsinourlives,particularlywhenthoseeventsarethreatening,\nharmful, or noxious, the psychological consequences can be profound. In one of the better illustrations of\nthisconcept,psychologistMartinSeligmanconductedaseriesofclassicexperimentsinthe1960s(Seligman\n& Maier, 1967) in which dogs were placed in a chamber where they received electric shocks from which\nthey could not escape. Later, when these dogs were given the opportunity to escape the shocks by jumping\nacross a partition, most failed to even try; they seemed to just give up and passively accept any shocks the\nexperimenters chose to administer. In comparison, dogs who were previously allowed to escape the shocks\ntended to jump the partition and escape the pain (Figure 14.22).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 519\nFigure 14.22 Seligman\u2019s learned helplessness experiments with dogs used an apparatus that measured\nwhen the animals would move from a floor delivering shocks to one without.\nSeligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned\nhelplessness: They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious\nstimulation they were receiving. Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs\ndemonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression. Therefore, Seligman speculated that\nacquiring a sense of learned helplessness might be an important cause of depression in humans: Humans\nwho experience negative life events that they believe they are unable to control may become helpless. As a\nresult,theygiveuptryingtocontrolorchangethesituationandsomemaybecomedepressedandshowlack\nof initiative in future situations in which they can control the outcomes (Seligman, Maier, & Geer, 1968).\nSeligmanandcolleagueslaterreformulatedtheoriginallearnedhelplessnessmodelofdepression(Abramson,\nSeligman, & Teasdale, 1978). In their reformulation, they emphasized attributions (i.e., a mental explanation\nfor why something occurred) that lead to the perception that one lacks control over negative outcomes are\nimportant in fostering a sense of learned helplessness. For example, suppose a coworker shows up late to\nwork; your belief as to what caused the coworker\u2019s tardiness would be an attribution (e.g., too much traffic,\nslept too late, or just doesn\u2019t care about being on time).\nThe reformulated version of Seligman\u2019s study holds that the attributions made for negative life events\ncontribute to depression. Consider the example of a student who performs poorly on a midterm exam. This\nmodel suggests that the student will make three kinds of attributions for this outcome: internal vs. external\n(believingtheoutcomewascausedbyhisownpersonalinadequaciesorbyenvironmentalfactors),stablevs.\nunstable(believingthecausecanbechangedorispermanent),andglobalvs.specific(believingtheoutcome\nisasignofinadequacyinmosteverythingversusjustthisarea).Assumethatthestudentmakesaninternal\n(\u201cI\u2019m just not smart\u201d), stable (\u201cNothing can be done to change the fact that I\u2019m not smart\u201d) and global (\u201cThis\nis another example of how lousy I am at everything\u201d) attribution for the poor performance. The reformulated\ntheorypredictsthatthestudentwouldperceivealackofcontroloverthisstressfuleventandthusbeespecially\npronetodevelopingdepression.Indeed,researchhasdemonstratedthatpeoplewhohaveatendencytomake\ninternal,global,andstableattributionsforbadoutcomestendtodevelopsymptomsofdepressionwhenfaced\nwith negative life experiences (Peterson & Seligman, 1984).\nSeligman\u2019s learned helplessness model has emerged over the years as a leading theoretical explanation for\ntheonsetofmajordepressivedisorder.Whenyoustudypsychologicaldisorders,youwilllearnmoreaboutthe\nlatest reformulation of this model\u2014now called hopelessness theory. 520 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nPeople who report higher levels of perceived control view their health as controllable, thereby making\nit more likely that they will better manage their health and engage in behaviors conducive to good\nhealth (Bandura, 2004). Not surprisingly, greater perceived control has been linked to lower risk of\nphysical health problems, including declines in physical functioning (Infurna, Gerstorf, Ram, Schupp, &\nWagner,2011),heartattacks(Rosengrenetal.,2004),andbothcardiovasculardiseaseincidence(St\u00fcrmer,\nHasselbach, & Amelang, 2006) and mortality from cardiac disease (Surtees et al., 2010). In addition,\nlongitudinal studies of British civil servants have found that those in low-status jobs (e.g., clerical and\noffice support staff) in which the degree of control over the job is minimal are considerably more likely\ntodevelopheartdiseasethanthosewithhigh-statusjobsorconsiderablecontrolovertheirjobs(Marmot,\nBosma, Hemingway, & Stansfeld, 1997).\nThe link between perceived control and health may provide an explanation for the frequently observed\nrelationship between social class and health outcomes (Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, &\nKeltner, 2012). In general, research has found that more affluent individuals experience better health\nmainly because they tend to believe that they can personally control and manage their reactions to life\u2019s\nstressors (Johnson & Krueger, 2006). Perhaps buoyed by the perceived level of control, individuals of\nhigher social class may be prone to overestimating the degree of influence they have over particular\noutcomes. For example, those of higher social class tend to believe that their votes have greater sway on\nelection outcomes than do those of lower social class, which may explain higher rates of voting in more\naffluent communities (Krosnick, 1990). Other research has found that a sense of perceived control can\nprotectlessaffluentindividualsfrompoorerhealth,depression,andreducedlife-satisfaction\u2014allofwhich\ntend to accompany lower social standing (Lachman & Weaver, 1998).\nTakentogether,findingsfromtheseandmanyotherstudiesclearlysuggestthatperceptionsofcontroland\ncoping abilities are important in managing and coping with the stressors we encounter throughout life.\nSOCIAL SUPPORT\nThe need to form and maintain strong, stable relationships with others is a powerful, pervasive, and\nfundamentalhumanmotive(Baumeister&Leary,1995).Buildingstronginterpersonalrelationshipswith\nothers helps us establish a network of close, caring individuals who can provide social support in times\nof distress, sorrow, and fear. Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends, family,\nandacquaintances(Baron&Kerr,2003).Socialsupportcantakemanyforms,includingadvice,guidance,\nencouragement, acceptance, emotional comfort, and tangible assistance (such as financial help).

Compared to those with the most\nsocial contacts, isolated men and women were, respectively, 2.3 and 2.8 times more likely to die. These\ntrends persisted even after controlling for a variety of health-related variables, such as smoking, alcohol\nconsumption,self-reportedhealthatthebeginningofthestudy,andphysicalactivity(Berkman&Syme,\n1979).\nSince the time of that study, social support has emerged as one of the well-documented psychosocial\nfactors affecting health outcomes (Uchino, 2009). A statistical review of 148 studies conducted between\n1982 and 2007 involving over 300,000 participants concluded that individuals with stronger social\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 521\nrelationshipshavea50%greaterlikelihoodofsurvivalcomparedtothosewithweakorinsufficientsocial\nrelationships (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010). According to the researchers, the magnitude of the\neffect of social support observed in this study is comparable with quitting smoking and exceeded many\nwell-known risk factors for mortality, such as obesity and physical inactivity (Figure 14.23).\nFigure 14.23 Close relationships with others, whether (a) a group of friends or (b) a family circle, provide more than\nhappiness and fulfillment\u2014they can help foster good health.

Studies of other\npopulations have produced similar results, including those of spousal caregivers of dementia sufferers,\nmedical students, elderly adults, and cancer patients (Cohen & Herbert, 1996; Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire,\nRobles, & Glaser, 2002).\nIn addition, social support has been shown to reduce blood pressure for people performing stressful\ntasks, such as giving a speech or performing mental arithmetic (Lepore, 1998).

Furthermore, the sense of belonging to his group might alleviate the distress of being ostracized by\nothers. However, the research literature on the effectiveness of this technique has produced mixed results.\nAnger expression/suppression refers to the options available as a function of the anger evoked by racial\nprejudice and discrimination. Put simply, a target of racist attitudes and behaviors can act upon her anger\nor suppress her anger. As discussed by Brondolo et al. (2009), there has been very little research on the\neffectivenessofeitherapproach;theresultsarequitemixedwithsomeshowingangerexpressionandothers\nshowing anger suppression as the healthier option.\nIn the end, racism-related stress is a complex issue and each of the coping strategies discussed here\nhas strengths and weaknesses. Brondolo et al. (2009) argue that it is imperative that additional research\nbe conducted to ascertain the most effective strategies for coping with the negative outcomes that are\nexperienced by the targets of racism.\nSTRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES\nBeyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks, there are numerous other\nmeansbywhichwecanmanagestress(Figure 14.24).Acommontechniquepeopleusetocombatstress\nisexercise(Salmon,2001).Itiswell-establishedthatexercise,bothoflong(aerobic)andshort(anaerobic)\nduration, is beneficial for both physical and mental health (Everly & Lating, 2002). There is considerable\nevidence that physically fit individuals are more resistant to the adverse effects of stress and recover\nmore quickly from stress than less physically fit individuals (Cotton, 1990). In a study of more than 500\nSwiss police officers and emergency service personnel, increased physical fitness was associated with\nreducedstress,andregularexercisewasreportedtoprotectagainststress-relatedhealthproblems(Gerber,\nKellman, Hartman, & P\u00fchse, 2010).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 523\nFigure 14.24 Stress reduction techniques may include (a) exercise, (b) meditation and relaxation, or (c)\nbiofeedback. (credit a: modification of work by \u201cUNE Photos\u201d/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Caleb Roenigk;\ncredit c: modification of work by Dr. Carmen Russoniello)\nOne reason exercise may be beneficial is because it might buffer some of the deleterious physiological\nmechanisms of stress. One study found rats that exercised for six weeks showed a decrease in\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to mild stressors (Campeau et al., 2010). In high-stress\nhumans, exercise has been shown to prevent telomere shortening, which may explain the common\nobservationofayouthfulappearanceamongthosewhoexerciseregularly(Putermanetal.,2010).Further,\nexercise in later adulthood appears to minimize the detrimental effects of stress on the hippocampus\nand memory (Head, Singh, & Bugg, 2012). Among cancer survivors, exercise has been shown to reduce\nanxiety (Speck, Courneya, Masse, Duval, & Schmitz, 2010) and depressive symptoms (Craft, VanIterson,\nHelenowski, Rademaker, & Courneya, 2012). Clearly, exercise is a highly effective tool for regulating\nstress.\nIn the 1970s, Herbert Benson, a cardiologist, developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation\nresponse technique (Greenberg, 2006). The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with\ntranscendentalmeditation, and consists of four components (Stein, 2001):\n1. sitting upright on a comfortable chair with feet on the ground and body in a relaxed position,\n2. a quiet environment with eyes closed,\n3. repeating a word or a phrase\u2014a mantra\u2014to oneself, such as \u201calert mind, calm body,\u201d\n4. passively allowing the mind to focus on pleasant thoughts, such as nature or the warmth of your\nblood nourishing your body.\nTherelaxationresponseapproachisconceptualizedasageneralapproachtostressreductionthatreduces\nsympatheticarousal,andithasbeenusedeffectivelytotreatpeoplewithhighbloodpressure(Benson&\nProctor, 1994).\nAnothertechniquetocombatstress,biofeedback,wasdevelopedbyGarySchwartzatHarvardUniversity\nin the early 1970s. Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a\nperson\u2019s neuromuscular and autonomic activity\u2014feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory\nsignals. The main assumption of this approach is that providing somebody biofeedback will enable the\nindividual to develop strategies that help gain some level of voluntary control over what are normally\ninvoluntary bodily processes (Schwartz & Schwartz, 1995). A number of different bodily measures have\nbeen used in biofeedback research, including facial muscle movement, brain activity, and skin\ntemperature, and it has been applied successfully with individuals experiencing tension headaches, high\nblood pressure, asthma, and phobias (Stein, 2001). 524 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\n14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define and discuss happiness, including its determinants\n\u2022 Describe the field of positive psychology and identify the kinds of problems it addresses\n\u2022 Explain the meaning of positive affect and discuss its importance in health outcomes\n\u2022 Describe the concept of flow and its relationship to happiness and fulfillment\nAlthough the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating, it\nis\u2014admittedly\u2014somewhat of a grim topic. Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat\nand encouraging approach to human affairs\u2014the quest for happiness.\nHAPPINESS\nAmerica\u2019s founders declared that its citizens have an unalienable right to pursue happiness. But what\nis happiness? When asked to define the term, people emphasize different aspects of this elusive state.\nIndeed,happinessissomewhatambiguousandcanbedefinedfromdifferentperspectives(Martin,2012).\nSome people,especially those who arehighlycommitted totheirreligious faith,view happiness inways\nthat emphasize virtuosity, reverence, and enlightened spirituality. Others see happiness as primarily\ncontentment\u2014the inner peace and joy that come from deep satisfaction with one\u2019s surroundings,\nrelationshipswithothers,accomplishments,andoneself.Stillothersviewhappinessmainlyaspleasurable\nengagementwiththeirpersonalenvironment\u2014havingacareerandhobbiesthatareengaging,meaningful,\nrewarding, and exciting. These differences, of course, are merely differences in emphasis. Most people\nwould probably agree that each of these views, in some respects, captures the essence of happiness.\nElements of Happiness\nSome psychologists have suggested that happiness consists of three distinct elements: the pleasant life,\nthe good life, and the meaningful life, as shown in Figure 14.25 (Seligman, 2002; Seligman, Steen, Park,\n& Peterson, 2005). The pleasant life is realized through the attainment of day-to-day pleasures that add\nfun, joy, and excitement to our lives. For example, evening walks along the beach and a fulfilling sex\nlife can enhance our daily pleasure and contribute to the pleasant life. The good life is achieved through\nidentifyingouruniqueskillsandabilitiesandengagingthesetalentstoenrichourlives;thosewhoachieve\nthegood lifeoftenfindthemselves absorbed intheirwork ortheirrecreational pursuits.

The definition implies that happiness is a long-\nterm state\u2014what is often characterized as subjective well-being\u2014rather than merely a transient positive\nmoodweallexperiencefromtimetotime.Itisthisenduringhappinessthathascapturedtheinterestsof\npsychologists and other social scientists.\nThe study of happiness has grown dramatically in the last three decades (Diener, 2013). One of the most\nbasicquestionsthathappinessinvestigatorsroutinelyexamineisthis:Howhappyarepeopleingeneral?\nThe average person in the world tends to be relatively happy and tends to indicate experiencing more\npositivefeelingsthannegativefeelings(Diener,Ng,Harter,&Arora,2010).Whenaskedtoevaluatetheir\ncurrentlivesonascalerangingfrom0to10(with0representing\u201cworstpossiblelife\u201dand10representing\n\u201cbest possible life\u201d), people in more than 150 countries surveyed from 2010\u20132012 reported an average\nscoreof5.2.PeoplewholiveinNorthAmerica,Australia,andNewZealandreportedthehighestaverage\nscore at 7.1, whereas those living Sub-Saharan Africa reported the lowest average score at 4.6 (Helliwell,\nLayard, & Sachs, 2013). Worldwide, the five happiest countries are Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the\nNetherlands,andSweden;theUnitedStatesisranked17thhappiest(Figure14.26)(Helliwelletal.,2013).\nFigure 14.26 (a) Surveys of residents in over 150 countries indicate that Denmark has the happiest citizens in the\nworld.

However, a recent poll of 2,345 U.S. adults surprisingly revealed that only one-\nthird reported they are \u201cvery happy.\u201d The poll also revealed that the happiness levels of certain groups,\nincludingminorities,recentcollegegraduates,andthedisabled,havetrendeddownwardinrecentyears\n(Gregoire,2013).Althoughitisdifficulttoexplainthisapparentdeclineinhappiness,itmaybeconnected\nto the challenging economic conditions the United States has endured over the last several years. Of\ncourse, this presumption would imply that happiness is closely tied to one\u2019s finances. But, is it? This\nquestion brings us to the next important issue: What factors influence happiness?\nFactors Connected to Happiness\nWhatreallymakespeoplehappy?Whatfactorscontributetosustainedjoyandcontentment?Isitmoney,\nattractiveness,materialpossessions,arewardingoccupation,asatisfyingrelationship?Extensiveresearch\novertheyearshasexaminedthisquestion.Onefindingisthatageisrelatedtohappiness:Lifesatisfaction\nusually increases the older people get, but there do not appear to be gender differences in happiness\n(Diener,Suh,Lucas,&Smith,1999).Althoughitisimportanttopointoutthatmuchofthisworkhasbeen\ncorrelational, many of the key findings (some of which may surprise you) are summarized below.\nFamilyandothersocialrelationshipsappeartobekeyfactorscorrelatedwithhappiness.Studiesshowthat\nmarriedpeoplereportbeinghappierthanthosewhoaresingle,divorced,orwidowed(Dieneretal.,1999).\nHappy individuals also report that their marriages are fulfilling (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005).\nIn fact, some have suggested that satisfaction with marriage and family life is the strongest predictor of\nhappiness(Myers,2000).Happypeopletendtohavemorefriends,morehigh-qualitysocialrelationships,\nand stronger social support networks than less happy people (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Happy people\nalso have a high frequency of contact with friends (Pinquart & S\u00f6rensen, 2000).\nCanmoneybuyhappiness?Ingeneral,extensiveresearchsuggeststhattheanswerisyes,butwithseveral\ncaveats. While a nation\u2019s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is associated with happiness levels\n(Helliwell et al., 2013), changes in GDP (which is a less certain index of household income) bear little\nrelationship to changes in happiness (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). On the whole, residents of affluent\ncountries tend to be happier than residents of poor countries; within countries, wealthy individuals are\nhappierthanpoorindividuals,buttheassociationismuchweaker(Diener&Biswas-Diener,2002).Tothe\nextent that it leads to increases in purchasing power, increases in income are associated with increases\nin happiness (Diener, Oishi, & Ryan, 2013). However, income within societies appears to correlate with\nhappiness only up to a point. In a study of over 450,000 U.S. residents surveyed by the Gallup\nOrganization, Kahneman and Deaton (2010) found that well-being rises with annual income, but only\nup to $75,000. The average increase in reported well-being for people with incomes greater than $75,000\nwas null. As implausible as these findings might seem\u2014after all, higher incomes would enable people\nto indulge in Hawaiian vacations, prime seats as sporting events, expensive automobiles, and expansive\nnew homes\u2014higher incomes may impair people\u2019s ability to savor and enjoy the small pleasures of life\n(Kahneman, 2011). Indeed, researchers in one study found that participants exposed to a subliminal\nreminder of wealth spent less time savoring a chocolate candy bar and exhibited less enjoyment of\nthis experience than did participants who were not reminded of wealth (Quoidbach, Dunn, Petrides, &\nMikolajczak, 2010).\nWhatabouteducationandemployment?Happypeople,comparedtothosewhoarelesshappy,aremore\nlikely to graduate from college and secure more meaningful and engaging jobs. Once they obtain a job,\nthey are also more likely to succeed (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). While education shows a positive (but\nweak) correlation with happiness, intelligence is not appreciably related to happiness (Diener et al., 1999).\nDoes religiosity correlate with happiness? In general, the answer is yes (Hackney & Sanders, 2003).\nHowever,therelationshipbetweenreligiosityandhappinessdependsonsocietalcircumstances.Nations\nandstateswithmoredifficultlivingconditions(e.g.,widespreadhungerandlowlifeexpectancy)tendto\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 527\nbe more highly religious than societies with more favorable living conditions. Among those who live in\nnations with difficult living conditions, religiosity is associated with greater well-being; in nations with\nmorefavorablelivingconditions,religiousandnonreligiousindividualsreportsimilarlevelsofwell-being\n(Diener, Tay, & Myers, 2011).\nClearly the living conditions of one\u2019s nation can influence factors related to happiness. What about the\ninfluenceofone\u2019sculture?Totheextentthatpeoplepossesscharacteristicsthatarehighlyvaluedbytheir\nculture, they tend to be happier (Diener, 2012). For example, self-esteem is a stronger predictor of life\nsatisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995), and\nextraverted people tend to be happier in extraverted cultures than in introverted cultures (Fulmer et al.,\n2010).\nSo we\u2019ve identified many factors that exhibit some correlation to happiness. What factors don\u2019t show\na correlation? Researchers have studied both parenthood and physical attractiveness as potential\ncontributors to happiness, but no link has been identified. Although people tend to believe that\nparenthood is central to a meaningful and fulfilling life, aggregate findings from a range of countries\nindicate that people who do not have children are generally happier than those who do (Hansen, 2012).\nAnd although one\u2019s perceived level of attractiveness seems to predict happiness, a person\u2019s objective\nphysical attractiveness is only weakly correlated with her happiness (Diener, Wolsic, & Fujita, 1995).\nLife Events and Happiness\nAn important point should be considered regarding happiness. People are often poor at affective\nforecasting:predictingtheintensityanddurationoftheirfutureemotions(Wilson&Gilbert,2003).Inone\nstudy, nearly all newlywed spouses predicted their marital satisfaction would remain stable or improve\noverthefollowingfouryears;despitethishighlevelofinitialoptimism,theirmaritalsatisfactionactually\ndeclinedduringthisperiod(Lavner,Karner,&Bradbury,2013).Inaddition,weareoftenincorrectwhen\nestimating how our long-term happiness would change for the better or worse in response to certain life\nevents. For example, it is easy for many of us to imagine how euphoric we would feel if we won the\nlottery, were asked on a date by an attractive celebrity, or were offered our dream job. It is also easy\nto understand how long-suffering fans of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, which has not won a World\nSerieschampionshipsince1908,thinktheywouldfeelpermanentlyelatediftheirteamwouldfinallywin\nanotherWorldSeries.Likewise,iteasytopredictthatwewouldfeelpermanentlymiserableifwesuffered\na crippling accident or if a romantic relationship ended.\nHowever, something similar to sensory adaptation often occurs when people experience emotional\nreactions to life events. In much the same way our senses adapt to changes in stimulation (e.g., our eyes\nadapting to bright light after walking out of the darkness of a movie theater into the bright afternoon\nsun),weeventuallyadapttochangingemotionalcircumstancesinourlives(Brickman&Campbell,1971;\nHelson, 1964). When an event that provokes positive or negative emotions occurs, at first we tend to\nexperience its emotional impact at full intensity. We feel a burst of pleasure following such things as a\nmarriage proposal, birth of a child, acceptance to law school, an inheritance, and the like; as you might\nimagine,lotterywinnersexperienceasurgeofhappinessafterhittingthejackpot(Lutter,2007).Likewise,\nweexperienceasurgeofmiseryfollowingwidowhood,adivorce,oralayofffromwork.Inthelongrun,\nhowever, we eventually adjust to the emotional new normal; the emotional impact of the event tends\nto erode, and we eventually revert to our original baseline happiness levels. Thus, what was at first a\nthrillinglotterywindfallorWorldSerieschampionshipeventuallylosesitslusterandbecomesthestatus\nquo (Figure 14.27). Indeed, dramatic life events have much less long-lasting impact on happiness than\nmight be expected (Brickman, Coats, & Janoff-Bulman, 1978). 528 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\nFigure 14.27 (a) Long-suffering Chicago Cub fans would no doubt feel elated if their team won a World Series\nchampionship, a feat that has not been accomplished by that franchise in over a century. (b) In ways that are similar,\nthose who play the lottery rightfully think that choosing the correct numbers and winning millions would lead to a\nsurge in happiness. However, the initial burst of elation following such elusive events would most likely erode with\ntime. (credit a: modification of work by Phil Roeder; credit b: modification of work by Robert S. Donovan)\nRecently, some have raised questions concerning the extent to which important life events can\npermanentlyalterpeople\u2019shappinesssetpoints(Diener,Lucas,&Scollon,2006).Evidencefromanumber\nof investigations suggests that, in some circumstances, happiness levels do not revert to their original\npositions. For example, although people generally tend to adapt to marriage so that it no longer makes\nthem happier or unhappier than before, they often do not fully adapt to unemployment or severe\ndisabilities(Diener,2012).Figure 14.28,whichisbasedonlongitudinaldatafromasampleofover3,000\nGerman respondents, shows life satisfaction scores several years before, during, and after various life\nevents,anditillustrateshowpeopleadapt(orfailtoadapt)totheseevents.Germanrespondentsdidnot\nget lasting emotional boosts from marriage; instead, they reported brief increases in happiness, followed\nbyquickadaptation.Incontrast,widowsandthosewhohadbeenlaidoffexperiencedsizeabledecreases\ninhappinessthatappearedtoresultinlong-termchangesinlifesatisfaction(Dieneretal.,2006).Further,\nlongitudinaldatafromthesamesampleshowedthathappinesslevelschangedsignificantlyovertimefor\nnearlyaquarterofrespondents,with9%showingmajorchanges(Fujita&Diener,2005).Thus,long-term\nhappiness levels can and do change for some people.\nFigure 14.28 This graphs shows life satisfaction scores several years before and after three significant life events (0\nrepresents the year the event happened) (Diener et al., 2006).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 529\nIncreasing Happiness\nSome recent findings about happiness provide an optimistic picture, suggesting that real changes in\nhappiness are possible. For example, thoughtfully developed well-being interventions designed to\naugment people\u2019s baseline levels of happiness may increase happiness in ways that are permanent and\nlong-lasting,notjusttemporary.Thesechangesinhappinessmaybetargetedatindividual,organizational,\nand societal levels (Diener et al., 2006). Researchers in one study found that a series of happiness\ninterventions involving such exercises as writing down three good things that occurred each day led to\nincreases in happiness that lasted over six months (Seligman et al., 2005).\nMeasuring happiness and well-being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in\ndetermining if people are generally happy or miserable, as well as when and why they might feel the\nwaytheydo.Studiesshowthataveragenationalhappinessscores(overtimeandacrosscountries)relate\nstronglytosixkeyvariables:percapitagrossdomesticproduct(GDP,whichreflectsanation\u2019seconomic\nstandard of living), social support, freedom to make important life choices, healthy life expectancy,\nfreedom from perceived corruption in government and business, and generosity (Helliwell et al., 2013).\nInvestigatingwhypeoplearehappyorunhappymighthelppolicymakersdevelopprogramsthatincrease\nhappiness and well-being within a society (Diener et al., 2006).

In a very general sense,\npositive psychology can be thought of as the science of happiness; it is an area of study that seeks to\nidentifyandpromotethosequalitiesthatleadtogreaterfulfillmentinourlives.Thisfieldlooksatpeople\u2019s\nstrengths and what helps individuals to lead happy, contented lives, and it moves away from focusing\nonpeople\u2019spathology,faults,andproblems.AccordingtoSeligmanandCsikszentmihalyi(2000),positive\npsychology,\nat the subjective level is about valued subjective experiences: well-being, contentment, and\nsatisfaction (inthepast);hopeandoptimism (forthefuture);and\u2026happiness (inthepresent).\nAttheindividuallevel,itisaboutpositiveindividualtraits:thecapacityforloveandvocation,\ncourage, interpersonal skill, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance, forgiveness, originality, future\nmindedness, spirituality, high talent, and wisdom.

Established in 2008 and led by renowned neuroscientist Dr.\nRichard J. Davidson, the Center examines a wide range of ideas, including such things as a kindness\ncurriculum inschools, neural correlates of prosocial behavior, psychological effects of TaiChi training, digital\ngames to foster prosocial behavior in children, and the effectiveness of yoga and breathing exercises in\nreducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nAccordingtoitswebsite,theCenterwasfoundedafterDr.DavidsonwaschallengedbyHisHoliness,the14th\nDalaiLama,\u201ctoapplytherigorsofsciencetostudypositivequalitiesofmind\u201d(CenterforInvestigatingHealth\nMinds, 2013). The Center continues to conduct scientific research with the aim of developing mental health\ntraining approaches that help people to live happier, healthier lives).\nPositive Affect and Optimism\nTaking a cue from positive psychology, extensive research over the last 10-15 years has examined the\nimportance of positive psychological attributes in physical well-being. Qualities that help promote\npsychological well-being (e.g., having meaning and purpose in life, a sense of autonomy, positive\nemotions, and satisfaction with life) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes (especially\nimproved cardiovascular health) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health\nbehaviors(suchasdiet,physicalactivity,andsleepquality)(Boehm&Kubzansky,2012).Thequalitythat\nhas received attention is positive affect, which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment,\nsuch as happiness, joy, enthusiasm, alertness, and excitement (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The\ncharacteristics of positive affect, as with negative affect (discussed earlier), can be brief, long-lasting, or\ntrait-like(Pressman&Cohen,2005).Independentofage,gender,andincome,positiveaffectisassociated\nwith greater social connectedness, emotional and practical support, adaptive coping efforts, and lower\ndepression; it is also associated with longevity and favorable physiological functioning (Steptoe,\nO\u2019Donnell, Marmot, & Wardle, 2008).\nPositiveaffectalsoservesasaprotectivefactoragainstheartdisease.Ina10-yearstudyofNovaScotians,\ntherateofheartdiseasewas22%lowerforeachone-pointincreaseonthemeasureofpositiveaffect,from\n1 (no positive affect expressed) to 5 (extreme positive affect) (Davidson, Mostofsky, & Whang, 2010).

It has also\nbeen conceptualized as a tendency to view life\u2019s stressors and difficulties as temporary and external to\noneself(Peterson&Steen,2002).Numerousstudiesovertheyearshaveconsistentlyshownthatoptimism\nis linked to longevity, healthier behaviors, fewer postsurgical complications, better immune functioning\namong men with prostate cancer, and better treatment adherence (Rasmussen & Wallio, 2008). Further,\noptimistic people report fewer physical symptoms, less pain, better physical functioning, and are less\nlikely to be rehospitalized following heart surgery (Rasmussen, Scheier, & Greenhouse, 2009).\nFLOW\nAnother factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well-being is the ability to derive\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 14 | Stress, Lifestyle, and Health 531\nflow from the things we do in life. Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and\nengrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). It is usually related to\ncreativeendeavorsandleisureactivities,butitcanalsobeexperiencedbyworkerswholiketheirjobsor\nstudents who love studying (Csikszentmihalyi, 1999). Many of us instantly recognize the notion of flow.\nInfact,thetermderivedfromrespondents\u2019spontaneoususeofthetermwhenaskedtodescribehowitfelt\nwhen what they were doing was going well. When people experience flow, they become involved in an\nactivity to the point where they feel they lose themselves in the activity. They effortlessly maintain their\nconcentrationandfocus,theyfeelasthoughtheyhavecompletecontroloftheiractions,andtimeseemsto\npass more quicklythanusual(Csikszentmihalyi, 1997).Flow isconsidered apleasurableexperience,and\nit typically occurs when people are engaged in challenging activities that require skills and knowledge\nthey know they possess. For example, people would be more likely report flow experiences in relation\nto their work or hobbies than in relation to eating. When asked the question, \u201cDo you ever get involved\nin something so deeply that nothing else seems to matter, and you lose track of time?\u201d about 20% of\nAmericans and Europeans report having these flow-like experiences regularly (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997).\nAlthough wealth and material possessions are nice to have, the notion of flow suggests that neither are\nprerequisites for a happy and fulfilling life. Finding an activity that you are truly enthusiastic about,\nsomethingsoabsorbingthatdoingitisrewarditself(whetheritbeplayingtennis,studyingArabic,writing\nchildren\u2019snovels,orcookinglavishmeals)isperhapstherealkey.AccordingtoCsikszentmihalyi(1999),\ncreatingconditionsthatmakeflowexperiencespossibleshouldbeatopsocialandpoliticalpriority.How\nmight this goal be achieved?

The body\u2019s primary physiological response during stress, the fight-or-flight response,\nwas first identified in the early 20th century by Walter Cannon. The fight-or-flight response involves\nthe coordinated activity of both the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n(HPA)axis.HansSelye,anotedendocrinologist,referredtothesephysiologicalreactionstostressaspart\nof general adaptation syndrome, which occurs in three stages: alarm reaction (fight-or-flight reactions\nbegin), resistance (the body begins to adapt to continuing stress), and exhaustion (adaptive energy is\ndepleted, and stress begins to take a physical toll).\n14.2Stressors\nStressors can be chronic (long term) or acute (short term), and can include traumatic events, significant\nlife changes, daily hassles, and situations in which people are frequently exposed to challenging and\nunpleasant events. Many potential stressors include events or situations that require us to make changes\ninourlives,suchasadivorceormovingtoanewresidence.ThomasHolmesandRichardRahedeveloped\ntheSocialReadjustmentRatingScale(SRRS)tomeasurestressbyassigninganumberoflifechangeunits\nto life events that typically require some adjustment, including positive events. Although the SRRS has\nbeen criticized on a number of grounds, extensive research has shown that the accumulation of many\nLCUsisassociatedwithincreasedriskofillness.Manypotentialstressorsalsoincludedailyhassles,which\nare minor irritations and annoyances that can build up over time. In addition, jobs that are especially\ndemanding, offer little control over one\u2019s working environment, or involve unfavorable working\nconditions can lead to job strain, thereby setting the stage for job burnout.\n14.3Stress and Illness\nPsychophysiological disorders are physical diseases that are either brought about or worsened by stress\nand other emotional factors. One of the mechanisms through which stress and emotional factors can\ninfluence the development of these diseases is by adversely affecting the body\u2019s immune system. A\nnumber of studies have demonstrated that stress weakens the functioning of the immune system.\nCardiovascular disorders are serious medical conditions that have been consistently shown to be\ninfluenced by stress and negative emotions, such as anger, negative affectivity, and depression. Other\npsychophysiological disorders that are known to be influenced by stress and emotional factors include\nasthma and tension headaches.\n14.4Regulation of Stress\nWhen faced with stress, people must attempt to manage or cope with it. In general, there are two basic\nforms of coping: problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping.

Extensive research has shown that social\nsupport has beneficial physiological effects for people, and it seems to influence immune functioning.\nHowever, the beneficial effects of social support may be related to its influence on promoting healthy\nbehaviors.\n14.5The Pursuit of Happiness\nHappiness is conceptualized as an enduring state of mind that consists of the capacity to experience\npleasureindailylife,aswellastheabilitytoengageone\u2019sskillsandtalentstoenrichone\u2019slifeandthelives\nof others.

Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he thought that he was being\ncontrolled by radio waves. He called the police to complain about voices in his head and being under\nsurveillanceby\u201cshadowyforces\u201d(Thomas,Levine,Date,&Cloherty,2013).WhileAlexis\u2019sactionscannot\nbe excused, it is clear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is not necessarily a cause\nof violence; it is far more likely that the mentally ill will be victims rather than perpetrators of violence\n(Stuart, 2003). If, however, Alexis had received the help he needed, this tragedy might have been averted. 540 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder\n\u2022 Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction\n\u2022 Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be\nconsidered abnormal and, thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder\nA psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\nPsychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their symptoms, etiology (i.e., their\ncauses), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological\ndisorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for mental health professionals\nto agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in the sense that they\ngenuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology.

If you felt extremely depressed\u2014so much so that\nyou lost interest in activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated\nsuicide\u2014your feelings would be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence\nof a psychological disorder. Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is\ndisordered.\nFor example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an\natypical characteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it\u2019s just unusual. And it is less\nunusualinScotland,whereapproximately13%ofthepopulationhasredhair(\u201cDNAProjectAims,\u201d2012).\nAsyouwilllearn,somedisorders,althoughnotexactlytypical,arefarfromatypical,andtheratesinwhich\nthey appear in the population are surprisingly high.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 541\nFigure 15.2 Red hair is considered unusual, but not abnormal.

Using this criterion, a woman who walks around a subway platform\nwearing a heavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as\nexhibiting symptoms of a psychological disorder. Her actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules\ngoverning appropriate dress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.\nCULTURAL EXPECTATIONS\nViolating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence\nof a psychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected\nand considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example,\nreturning a stranger\u2019s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates\nthat we reciprocate friendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be\nconsidered socially awkward\u2014perhaps even disordered\u2014for violating this expectation. However, such\nexpectationsarenotuniversallyshared.CulturalexpectationsinJapaninvolveshowingreserve,restraint,\nand a concern for maintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive\nto smiles from strangers (Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United\nStatesandEurope,eyecontactwithotherstypicallysignifieshonestyandattention.However,mostLatin-\nAmerican,Asian,andAfricanculturesinterpretdirecteyecontactasrude,confrontational,andaggressive\n(Pazain, 2010). Thus, someone who makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and\nrespectful or brazen and offensive, depending on your culture (Figure 15.3).\nFigure 15.3 Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture.

Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health\nestablishment)tostigmatizeandsubjugatepeoplewhosebehaviorviolatesacceptedsocialandlegalnorms.\nIndeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately\ncharacterized as \u201cproblems in living\u201d (Szasz, 1960).\nInhis1961book,TheMythofMentalIllness:FoundationsofaTheoryofPersonalConduct,Szaszexpressed\nhisdisdainfortheconceptofmentalillnessandforthefieldofpsychiatryingeneral(Oliver,2006).Thebasis\nfor Szasz\u2019s attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g.,\ninfectionsandorgandamageordysfunction)representthedefiningfeaturesofgenuineillnessordisease,and\nbecause symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-\ncalledpsychologicaldisordersarenotdisordersatall.Szasz(1961/2010)proclaimedthat\u201cdiseaseorillness\ncan only affect the body; hence, there can be no mental illness\u201d (p. 267).\nToday, we recognize the extreme level of psychological suffering experienced by people with psychological\ndisorders: the painful thoughts and feelings they experience, the disordered behavior they demonstrate, and\nthe levels of distress and impairment they exhibit. This makes it very difficult to deny the reality of mental\nillness.\nHowevercontroversialSzasz\u2019sviewsandthoseofhissupportersmighthavebeen,theyhaveinfluencedthe\nmentalhealthcommunityandsocietyinseveralways.First,laypeople,politicians,andprofessionalsnowoften\nrefertomentalillnessasmentalhealth\u201cproblems,\u201dimplicitlyacknowledgingthe\u201cproblemsinliving\u201dperspective\nSzaszdescribed(Buchanan-Barker&Barker,2009).AlsoinfluentialwasSzasz\u2019sviewofhomosexuality.Szasz\nwasperhapsthefirstpsychiatristtoopenlychallengetheideathathomosexualityrepresentedaformofmental\nillness or disease (Szasz, 1965).

Many efforts have been made to identify the specific\ndimensions of psychological disorders, yet none is entirely satisfactory. No universal definition of\npsychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present\n(Zachar & Kendler, 2007). However, one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by\nWakefield (1992), who defined psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction. Wakefield argued that\nnatural internal mechanisms\u2014that is, psychological processes honed by evolution, such as cognition,\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 543\nperception,andlearning\u2014haveimportantfunctions,suchasenablingustoexperiencetheworldtheway\nothersdoandtoengageinrationalthought,problemsolving,andcommunication.Forexample,learning\nallows us to associate a fear with a potential danger in such a way that the intensity of fear is roughly\nequal to the degree of actual danger. Dysfunction occurs when an internal mechanism breaks down and\ncannolongerperformitsnormalfunction.But,thepresenceofadysfunctionbyitselfdoesnotdetermine\na disorder. The dysfunction must be harmful in that it leads to negative consequences for the individual\nor for others, as judged by the standards of the individual\u2019s culture. The harm may include significant\ninternalanguish(e.g.,highlevelsofanxietyordepression)orproblemsinday-to-dayliving(e.g.,inone\u2019s\nsocial or work life).\nTo illustrate, Janet has an extreme fear of spiders. Janet\u2019s fear might be considered a dysfunction in that\nit signals that the internal mechanism of learning is not working correctly (i.e., a faulty process prevents\nJanet from appropriately associating the magnitude of her fear with the actual threat posed by spiders).\nJanet\u2019s fear of spiders has a significant negative influence on her life: she avoids all situations in which\nshesuspectsspiderstobepresent(e.g.,thebasementorafriend\u2019shome),andshequitherjoblastmonth\nbecause she saw a spider in the restroom at work and is now unemployed. According to the harmful\ndysfunction model, Janet\u2019s condition would signify a disorder because (a) there is a dysfunction in an\ninternal mechanism, and (b) the dysfunction has resulted in harmful consequences. Similar to how the\nsymptoms of physical illness reflect dysfunctions in biological processes, the symptoms of psychological\ndisorders presumably reflect dysfunctions in mental processes. The internal mechanism component of\nthis model is especially appealing because it implies that disorders may occur through a breakdown\nof biological functions that govern various psychological processes, thus supporting contemporary\nneurobiological models of psychological disorders (Fabrega, 2007).\nTHE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION (APA) DEFINITION\nMany of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of\npsychologicaldisorderdevelopedbytheAmericanPsychiatricAssociation(APA).AccordingtotheAPA\n(2013), a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following:\n\u2022 Therearesignificantdisturbancesinthoughts,feelings,andbehaviors.Apersonmustexperience\ninner states (e.g., thoughts and/or feelings) and exhibit behaviors that are clearly disturbed\u2014that\nis, unusual, but in a negative, self-defeating way. Often, such disturbances are troubling to those\naround the individual who experiences them. For example, an individual who is uncontrollably\npreoccupied by thoughts of germs spends hours each day bathing, has inner experiences, and\ndisplays behaviors that most would consider atypical and negative (disturbed) and that would\nlikely be troubling to family members.\n\u2022 Thedisturbances reflectsomekindofbiological,psychological,ordevelopmentaldysfunction.\nDisturbed patterns of inner experiences and behaviors should reflect some flaw (dysfunction) in\ntheinternalbiological,psychological,anddevelopmentalmechanismsthatleadtonormal,healthy\npsychological functioning. For example, the hallucinations observed in schizophrenia could be a\nsign of brain abnormalities.\n\u2022 The disturbances lead to significant distress or disability in one\u2019s life.

How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person\u2019s inner\nstates and behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder? Arriving at a proper diagnosis\u2014that is,\nappropriately identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms\u2014is absolutely crucial. This process\nenablesprofessionalstouseacommonlanguagewithothersinthefieldandaidsincommunicationabout\nthedisorderwiththepatient,colleaguesandthepublic.Aproperdiagnosisisanessentialelementtoguide\nproper and successful treatment. For these reasons, classification systems that organize psychological\ndisorders systematically are necessary.\nTHE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS (DSM)\nAlthough a number of classification systems have been developed over time, the one that is used by\nmostmentalhealthprofessionalsintheUnitedStatesistheDiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMental\nDisorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). (Note that the American\nPsychiatricAssociationdiffersfromtheAmericanPsychologicalAssociation;bothareabbreviatedAPA.)\nThe first edition of the DSM, published in 1952, classified psychological disorders according to a format\ndevelopedbytheU.S.ArmyduringWorldWarII(Clegg,2012).Intheyearssince,theDSMhasundergone\nnumerous revisions and editions. The most recent edition, published in 2013, is the DSM-5 (APA, 2013).\nThe DSM-5 includes many categories of disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and\ndissociative disorders). Each disorder is described in detail, including an overview of the disorder\n(diagnostic features), specific symptoms required for diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), prevalence\ninformation(whatpercentofthepopulationisthoughttobeafflictedwiththedisorder),andriskfactors\nassociated with the disorder. Figure 15.4 shows lifetime prevalence rates\u2014the percentage of people in\na population who develop a disorder in their lifetime\u2014of various psychological disorders among U.S.\nadults.Thesedatawerebasedonanationalsampleof9,282U.S.residents(NationalComorbiditySurvey,\n2007).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 545\nFigure 15.4 The graph shows the breakdown of psychological disorders, comparing the percentage prevalence\namong adult males and adult females in the United States. Because the data is from 2007, the categories shown\nhere are from the DSM-IV, which has been supplanted by the DSM-5. Most categories remain the same; however,\nalcohol abuse now falls under a broader Alcohol Use Disorder category.\nThe DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity; the co-occurrence of two disorders. For\nexample, the DSM-5 mentions that 41% of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) also meet\nthediagnosticcriteriaformajordepressivedisorder(Figure15.5).Druguseishighlycomorbidwithother\nmental illnesses; 6 out of 10 people who have a substance use disorder also suffer from another form of\nmental illness (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2007).\nFigure 15.5 Obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder frequently occur in the same person.\nThe DSM has changed considerably in the half-century since it was originally published. The first two\neditionsoftheDSM,forexample,listedhomosexualityasadisorder;however,in1973,theAPAvotedto\nremove it from the manual (Silverstein, 2009). Additionally, beginning with the DSM-III in 1980, mental\ndisorders have been described in much greater detail, and the number of diagnosable conditions has 546 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\ngrownsteadily,ashasthesizeofthemanualitself.DSM-Iincluded106diagnosesandwas130totalpages,\nwhereasDSM-IIIincludedmorethan2timesasmanydiagnoses(265)andwasnearlyseventimesitssize\n(886totalpages)(Mayes&Horowitz,2005).AlthoughDSM-5islongerthanDSM-IV,thevolumeincludes\nonly237disorders,adecreasefromthe297disordersthatwerelistedinDSM-IV.Thelatestedition,DSM-5,\nincludes revisions in the organization and naming of categories and in the diagnostic criteria for various\ndisorders (Regier, Kuhl, & Kupfer, 2012), while emphasizing careful consideration of the importance of\ngender and cultural difference in the expression of various symptoms (Fisher, 2010).\nSome believe that establishing new diagnoses might overpathologize the human condition by turning\ncommon human problems into mental illnesses (The Associated Press, 2013). Indeed, the finding that\nnearly half of all Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM disorder at some point in their life (Kessler\net al., 2005) likely fuels much of this skepticism. The DSM-5 is also criticized on the grounds that its\ndiagnostic criteria have been loosened, thereby threatening to \u201cturn our current diagnostic inflation into\ndiagnostic hyperinflation\u201d (Frances, 2012, para. 22). For example, DSM-IV specified that the symptoms\nof major depressive disorder must not be attributable to normal bereavement (loss of a loved one). The\nDSM-5, however, has removed this bereavement exclusion, essentially meaning that grief and sadness\nafter a loved one\u2019s death can constitute major depressive disorder.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES\nA second classification system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), is also widely\nrecognized. Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD was developed in Europe\nshortly after World War II and, like the DSM, has been revised several times. The categories of\npsychological disorders in both the DSM and ICD are similar, as are the criteria for specific disorders;\nhowever, some differences exist. Although the ICD is used for clinical purposes, this tool is also used to\nexamine the general health of populations and to monitor the prevalence of diseases and other health\nproblems internationally (WHO, 2013). The ICD is in its 10th edition (ICD-10); however, efforts are now\nunderway to develop a new edition (ICD-11) that, in conjunction with the changes in DSM-5, will help\nharmonize the two classification systems as much as possible (APA, 2013).\nA study that compared the use of the two classification systems found that worldwide the ICD is more\nfrequentlyusedforclinicaldiagnosis,whereastheDSMismorevaluedforresearch(Mezzich,2002).Most\nresearchfindingsconcerningtheetiologyandtreatmentofpsychologicaldisordersarebasedoncriteriaset\nforthintheDSM(Oltmanns&Castonguay,2013).TheDSMalsoincludesmoreexplicitdisordercriteria,\nalong with an extensive and helpful explanatory text (Regier et al., 2012). The DSM is the classification\nsystemofchoiceamongU.S.mentalhealthprofessionals,andthischapterisbasedontheDSMparadigm.\nTHE COMPASSIONATE VIEW OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS\nAs these disorders are outlined, please bear two things in mind. First, remember that psychological\ndisorders represent extremes of inner experience and behavior. If, while reading about these disorders,\nyou feel that these descriptions begin to personally characterize you, do not worry\u2014this moment of\nenlightenment probably means nothing more than you are normal. Each of us experiences episodes of\nsadness, anxiety, and preoccupation with certain thoughts\u2014times when we do not quite feel ourselves.\nThese episodes should not be considered problematic unless the accompanying thoughts and behaviors\nbecome extreme and have a disruptive effect on one\u2019s life. Second, understand that people with\npsychological disorders are far more than just embodiments of their disorders. We do not use terms\nsuch as schizophrenics, depressives, or phobics because they are labels that objectify people who suffer\nfromtheseconditions,thuspromotingbiasedanddisparagingassumptionsaboutthem.Itisimportantto\nrememberthatapsychologicaldisorderisnotwhatapersonis;itissomethingthatapersonhas\u2014through\nnofaultofhisorherown.Asisthecasewithcancerordiabetes,thosewithpsychologicaldisorderssuffer\ndebilitating, often painful conditions that are not of their own choosing.

Different perspectives provide alternate ways for how to think about the\nnature of psychopathology.\nSUPERNATURAL PERSPECTIVES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS\nFor centuries, psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective: attributed to a\nforce beyond scientific understanding. Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or\npossessed by spirits (Figure 15.6) (Maher & Maher, 1985). For example, convents throughout Europe in\nthe16thand17thcenturiesreportedhundredsofnunsfallingintoastateoffrenzyinwhichtheafflicted\nfoamed at the mouth, screamed and convulsed, sexually propositioned priests, and confessed to having\ncarnalrelationswithdevilsorChrist.Although,today,thesecaseswouldsuggestseriousmentalillness;at\nthetime,theseeventswereroutinelyexplainedaspossessionbydevilishforces(Waller,2009a).Similarly,\ngrievousfitsbyyounggirlsarebelievedtohaveprecipitatedthewitchpanicinNewEnglandlateinthe\n17th century (Demos, 1983). Such beliefs in supernatural causes of mental illness are still held in some\nsocieties today; for example, beliefs that supernatural forces cause mental illness are common in some\ncultures in modern-day Nigeria (Aghukwa, 2012). 548 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nFigure 15.6 InThe Extraction of the Stone of Madness, a 15th century painting by Hieronymus Bosch, a practitioner\nis using a tool to extract an object (the supposed \u201cstone of madness\u201d) from the head of an afflicted person.\nDIG DEEPER\nDancing Mania\nBetween the 11th and 17th centuries, a curious epidemic swept across Western Europe. Groups of people\nwould suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon. This compulsion to dance\u2014referred to as dancing\nmania\u2014sometimesgrippedthousandsofpeopleatatime(Figure15.7).Historicalaccountsindicatethatthose\nafflictedwouldsometimesdancewithbruisedandbloodyfeetfordaysorweeks,screamingofterriblevisions\nandbeggingpriestsandmonkstosavetheirsouls(Waller,2009b).Whatcauseddancingmaniaisnotknown,\nbutseveralexplanationshavebeenproposed,includingspidervenomandergotpoisoning(\u201cDancingMania,\u201d\n2011).\nFigure 15.7 Although the cause of dancing mania, depicted in this painting, was unclear, the behavior was\nattributed to supernatural forces.\nHistorian John Waller (2009a, 2009b) has provided a comprehensive and convincing explanation of dancing\nmaniathatsuggeststhephenomenonwasattributabletoacombinationofthreefactors:psychologicaldistress,\nsocial contagion, and belief in supernatural forces. Waller argued that various disasters of the time (such as\nfamine,plagues,andfloods)producedhighlevelsofpsychologicaldistressthatcouldincreasethelikelihood\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 549\nof succumbing to an involuntary trance state. Waller indicated that anthropological studies and accounts of\npossession rituals show that people are more likely to enter a trance state if they expect it to happen, and\nthat entranced individuals behave in a ritualistic manner, their thoughts and behavior shaped by the spiritual\nbeliefs of their culture. Thus, during periods of extreme physical and mental distress, all it took were a few\npeople\u2014believingthemselvestohavebeenafflictedwithadancingcurse\u2014toslipintoaspontaneoustrance\nand then act out the part of one who is cursed by dancing for days on end.\nBIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS\nThe biological perspective views psychological disorders as linked to biological phenomena, such as\ngenetic factors, chemical imbalances, and brain abnormalities; it has gained considerable attention and\nacceptance in recent decades (Wyatt & Midkiff, 2006). Evidence from many sources indicates that most\npsychological disorders have a genetic component; in fact, there is little dispute that some disorders are\nlargely due to genetic factors. The graph inFigure 15.8showsheritabilityestimates for schizophrenia.\nFigure 15.8 A person\u2019s risk of developing schizophrenia increases if a relative has schizophrenia. The closer the\ngenetic relationship, the higher the risk.\nFindings such as these have led many of today\u2019s researchers to search for specific genes and genetic\nmutations that contribute to mental disorders. Also, sophisticated neural imaging technology in recent\ndecades has revealed how abnormalities in brain structure and function might be directly involved in\nmany disorders, and advances in our understanding of neurotransmitters and hormones have yielded\ninsights into their possible connections. The biological perspective is currently thriving in the study of\npsychological disorders.\nTHE DIATHESIS-STRESS MODEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS\nDespite advances in understanding the biological basis of psychological disorders, the psychosocial\nperspective is still very important. This perspective emphasizes the importance of learning, stress, faulty 550 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nand self-defeating thinking patterns, and environmental factors. Perhaps the best way to think about\npsychological disorders, then, is to view them as originating from a combination of biological and\npsychologicalprocesses.Manydevelopnotfromasinglecause,butfromadelicatefusionbetweenpartly\nbiological and partly psychosocial factors.\nThe diathesis-stress model (Zuckerman, 1999) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict\nthe likelihood of a disorder. This diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying\npredisposition for a disorder (i.e., a diathesis) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when\nfaced with adverse environmental or psychological events (i.e., stress), such as childhood maltreatment,\nnegative life events, trauma, and so on. A diathesis is not always a biological vulnerability to an illness;\nsome diatheses may be psychological (e.g., a tendency to think about life events in a pessimistic, self-\ndefeating way).\nThekeyassumptionofthediathesis-stressmodelisthatbothfactors,diathesisandstress,arenecessaryin\nthedevelopmentofadisorder.Differentmodelsexploretherelationshipbetweenthetwofactors:thelevel\nof stress needed to produce the disorder is inversely proportional to the level of diathesis.\n15.4 Anxiety Disorders\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Distinguish normal anxiety from pathological anxiety\n\u2022 List and describe the major anxiety disorders, including their main features and prevalence\n\u2022 Describe basic psychological and biological factors that are suspected to be important in the\netiology of anxiety disorder\nEverybodyexperiencesanxietyfromtimetotime.Althoughanxietyiscloselyrelatedtofear,thetwostates\npossess important differences. Fear involves an instantaneous reaction to an imminent threat, whereas\nanxietyinvolvesapprehension,avoidance,andcautiousnessregardingapotentialthreat,danger,orother\nnegative event (Craske, 1999). While anxiety is unpleasant to most people, it is important to our health,\nsafety, and well-being. Anxiety motivates us to take actions\u2014such as preparing for exams, watching our\nweight, showing up to work on time\u2014that enable us to avert potential future problems. Anxiety also\nmotivates us to avoid certain things\u2014such as running up debts and engaging in illegal activities\u2014that\ncouldleadtofuturetrouble.Mostindividuals\u2019levelanddurationofanxietyapproximatesthemagnitude\nof the potential threat they face. For example, suppose a single woman in her late 30s who wishes to\nmarryisconcernedaboutthepossibilityofhavingtosettleforaspousewhoislessattractiveandeducated\nthan desired.

Although anxiety is universally experienced, anxiety disorders\ncause considerable distress. As a group, anxiety disorders are common: approximately 25%\u201330% of the\nU.S. population meets the criteria for at least one anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Kessler et al.,\n2005). Also, these disorders appear to be much more common in women than they are in men; within a\n12-month period, around 23% of women and 14% of men will experience at least one anxiety disorder\n(NationalComorbiditySurvey,2007).Anxietydisordersarethemostfrequentlyoccurringclassofmental\ndisordersandareoftencomorbidwitheachotherandwithothermentaldisorders(Kessler,Ruscio,Shear,\n& Wittchen, 2009).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 551\nSPECIFIC PHOBIA\nPhobia is a Greek word that means fear.

Agoraphobia, which literally means \u201cfear of the\nmarketplace,\u201d is characterized by intense fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations in which it might be\ndifficulttoescapeorreceivehelpifoneexperiencessymptomsofapanicattack(astateofextremeanxiety\nthat we will discuss shortly). These situations include public transportation, open spaces (parking lots),\nenclosedspaces(stores),crowds,orbeingoutsidethehomealone(APA,2013).About1.4%ofAmericans\nexperience agoraphobia during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).\nACQUISITION OF PHOBIAS THROUGH LEARNING\nManytheoriessuggestthatphobiasdevelopthroughlearning.Rachman(1977)proposedthatphobiascan\nbe acquired through three major learning pathways. The first pathway is through classical conditioning.\nAs you may recall, classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is\npaired with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response (UCR),\nelicitingthesameresponsethroughitsassociationwiththeunconditionedstimulus.Theresponseiscalled\na conditioned response (CR). For example, a child who has been bitten by a dog may come to fear dogs\nbecauseofherpastassociationwithpain.Inthiscase,thedogbiteistheUCSandthefearitelicitsisthe\nUCR.Becauseadogwasassociated withthebite,anydogmaycometoserveasaconditioned stimulus, 552 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nthereby eliciting fear; the fear the child experiences around dogs, then, becomes a CR.\nThesecondpathwayofphobiaacquisitionisthroughvicariouslearning,suchasmodeling.Forexample,\na child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears, even though\nspiders have never presented any danger to him. This phenomenon has been observed in both humans\nandnonhumanprimates(Olsson&Phelps,2007).Astudyoflaboratory-rearedmonkeysreadilyacquired\na fear of snakes after observing wild-reared monkeys react fearfully to snakes (Mineka & Cook, 1993).\nThe third pathway is through verbal transmission or information. For example, a child whose parents,\nsiblings, friends, and classmates constantly tell her how disgusting and dangerous snakes are may come\nto acquire a fear of snakes.\nInterestingly,peoplearemorelikelytodevelopphobiasofthingsthatdonotrepresentmuchactualdanger\nto themselves, such as animals and heights, and are less likely to develop phobias toward things that\npresentlegitimatedangerincontemporarysociety,suchasmotorcyclesandweapons(\u00d6hman&Mineka,\n2001). Why might this be so? One theory suggests that the human brain is evolutionarily predisposed\nto more readily associate certain objects or situations with fear (Seligman, 1971). This theory argues that\nthroughoutourevolutionaryhistory,ourancestorsassociatedcertainstimuli(e.g.,snakes,spiders,heights,\nand thunder) with potential danger. As time progressed, the mind has become adapted to more readily\ndevelop fears of these things than of others. Experimental evidence has consistently demonstrated that\nconditionedfearsdevelopmorereadilytofear-relevantstimuli(imagesofsnakesandspiders)thantofear-\nirrelevant stimuli (images of flowers and berries) (\u00d6hman & Mineka, 2001).

The observer monkeys developed fears of the fear-relevant\nstimuli but not the fear-irrelevant stimuli.\nSOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER\nSocialanxietydisorder(formerlycalledsocialphobia)ischaracterizedbyextremeandpersistentfearor\nanxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively\nby others (APA, 2013). As with specific phobias, social anxiety disorder is common in the United States;\na little over 12% of all Americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Kessler et al.,\n2005).\nThe heart of the fear and anxiety in social anxiety disorder is the person\u2019s concern that he may act in a\nhumiliating or embarrassing way, such as appearing foolish, showing symptoms of anxiety (blushing),\nor doing or saying something that might lead to rejection (such as offending others). The kinds of\nsocial situations in which individuals with social anxiety disorder usually have problems include public\nspeaking,havingaconversation,meetingstrangers,eatinginrestaurants,and,insomecases,usingpublic\nrestrooms. Although many people become anxious in social situations like public speaking, the fear,\nanxiety, and avoidance experienced in social anxiety disorder are highly distressing and lead to serious\nimpairmentsinlife.Adultswiththisdisorderaremorelikelytoexperiencelowereducationalattainment\nand lower earnings (Katzelnick et al., 2001), perform more poorly at work and are more likely to be\nunemployed(Moitra,Beard,Weisberg,&Keller,2011),andreportgreaterdissatisfactionwiththeirfamily\nlives, friends, leisure activities, and income (Stein & Kean, 2000).\nWhen people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety, they\ntypically perform safety behaviors: mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by\nreducingthechanceofnegativesocialoutcomes.Safetybehaviorsincludeavoidingeyecontact,rehearsing\nsentences before speaking, talking only briefly, and not talking about oneself (Alden & Bieling, 1998).\nOther examples of safety behaviors include the following (Marker, 2013):\n\u2022 assuming roles in social situations that minimize interaction with others (e.g., taking pictures,\nsetting up equipment, or helping prepare food)\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 553\n\u2022 asking people many questions to keep the focus off of oneself\n\u2022 selecting a position to avoid scrutiny or contact with others (sitting in the back of the room)\n\u2022 wearing bland, neutral clothes to avoid drawing attention to oneself\n\u2022 avoiding substances or activities that might cause anxiety symptoms (such as caffeine, warm\nclothing, and physical exercise)\nAlthough these behaviors are intended to prevent the person with social anxiety disorder from doing\nsomethingawkwardthatmightdrawcriticism,theseactionsusuallyexacerbatetheproblembecausethey\ndonotallowtheindividual todisconfirm hisnegativebeliefs,oftenelicitingrejection andothernegative\nreactions from others (Alden & Bieling, 1998).\nPeople with social anxiety disorder may resort to self-medication, such as drinking alcohol, as a means\ntoaverttheanxietysymptomstheyexperienceinsocialsituations(Battista&Kocovski,2010).Theuseof\nalcoholwhenfacedwithsuchsituationsmaybecomenegativelyreinforcing:encouragingindividualswith\nsocialanxietydisordertoturntothesubstancewhenevertheyexperienceanxietysymptoms.Thetendency\nto use alcohol as a coping mechanism for social anxiety, however, can come with a hefty price tag: a\nnumberoflargescalestudieshavereportedahighrateofcomorbiditybetweensocialanxietydisorderand\nalcohol use disorder (Morris, Stewart, & Ham, 2005).\nAs with specific phobias, it is highly probable that the fears inherent to social anxiety disorder can\ndevelop through conditioning experiences. For example, a child who is subjected to early unpleasant\nsocial experiences (e.g., bullying at school) may develop negative social images of herself that become\nactivated later in anxiety-provoking situations (Hackmann, Clark, & McManus, 2000). Indeed, one study\nreported that 92% of a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder reported a history of severe teasing\nin childhood, compared to only 35% of a sample of adults with panic disorder (McCabe, Antony,\nSummerfeldt, Liss, & Swinson, 2003).\nOneofthemostwell-establishedriskfactorsfordevelopingsocialanxietydisorderisbehavioralinhibition\n(Clauss&Blackford,2012).Behavioralinhibitionisthoughttobeaninheritedtrait,anditischaracterized\nby a consistent tendency to show fear and restraint when presented with unfamiliar people or situations\n(Kagan, Reznick, & Snidman, 1988). Behavioral inhibition is displayed very early in life; behaviorally\ninhibitedtoddlersandchildrenrespondwithgreatcautionandrestraintinunfamiliarsituations,andthey\nare often timid, fearful, and shy around unfamiliar people (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols, & Ghera,\n2005). A recent statistical review of studies demonstrated that behavioral inhibition was associated with\nmore than a sevenfold increase in the risk of development of social anxiety disorder, demonstrating that\nbehavioral inhibition is a major risk factor for the disorder (Clauss & Blackford, 2012).\nPANIC DISORDER\nImagine that you are at the mall one day with your friends and\u2014suddenly and inexplicably\u2014you begin\nsweating and trembling, your heart starts pounding, you have trouble breathing, and you start to feel\ndizzyandnauseous.Thisepisodelastsfor10minutesandisterrifyingbecauseyoustarttothinkthatyou\nare going to die. When you visit your doctor the following morning and describe what happened, she\ntells you that you have experienced a panic attack (Figure 15.9). If you experience another one of these\nepisodestwoweekslaterandworryforamonthormorethatsimilarepisodeswilloccurinthefuture,it\nis likely that you have developed panic disorder. 554 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nFigure 15.9 Some of the physical manifestations of a panic attack are shown. People may also experience\nsweating, trembling, feelings of faintness, or a fear of losing control, among other symptoms.\nPeople with panic disorder experience recurrent (more than one) and unexpected panic attacks, along\nwithatleastonemonthofpersistentconcernaboutadditionalpanicattacks,worryovertheconsequences\nof the attacks, or self-defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or\nunfamiliar situations) (APA, 2013). As is the case with other anxiety disorders, the panic attacks cannot\nresultfromthephysiologicaleffectsofdrugsandothersubstances,amedicalcondition,oranothermental\ndisorder. A panic attack is defined as a period of extreme fear or discomfort that develops abruptly\nand reaches a peak within 10 minutes. Its symptoms include accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling,\nchoking sensations, hot flashes or chills, dizziness or lightheadedness, fears of losing control or going\ncrazy, and fears of dying (APA, 2013). Sometimes panic attacks are expected, occurring in response to\nspecific environmental triggers (such as being in a tunnel); other times, these episodes are unexpected\nand emerge randomly (such as when relaxing). According to the DSM-5, the person must experience\nunexpected panic attacks to qualify for a diagnosis of panic disorder.\nExperiencing a panic attack is often terrifying. Rather than recognizing the symptoms of a panic attack\nmerelyassignsofintenseanxiety,individualswithpanicdisorderoftenmisinterpretthemasasignthat\nsomething is intensely wrong internally (thinking, for example, that the pounding heart represents an\nimpending heart attack). Panic attacks can occasionally precipitate trips to the emergency room because\nseveral symptoms of panic attacks are, in fact, similar to those associated with heart problems (e.g.,\npalpitations,racingpulse,andapoundingsensationinthechest)(Root,2000).Unsurprisingly,thosewith\npanicdisorderfearfutureattacksandmaybecomepreoccupiedwithmodifyingtheirbehaviorinaneffort\ntoavoidfuturepanicattacks.Forthisreason,panicdisorderisoftencharacterizedasfearoffear(Goldstein\n& Chambless, 1978).\nPanicattacksthemselvesarenotmentaldisorders.Indeed,around23%ofAmericansexperienceisolated\npanicattacksintheirliveswithoutmeetingthecriteriaforpanicdisorder(Kessleretal.,2006),indicating\nthat panic attacks are fairly common. Panic disorder is, of course, much less common, afflicting 4.7%\nof Americans during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). Many people with panic disorder develop\nagoraphobia, which is marked by fear and avoidance of situations in which escape might be difficult or\nhelpmightnotbeavailableifoneweretodevelopsymptomsofapanicattack.Peoplewithpanicdisorder\noftenexperienceacomorbiddisorder,suchasotheranxietydisordersormajordepressivedisorder(APA,\n2013).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 555\nResearchers arenot entirely sure what causes panic disorder. Children areatahigher risk of developing\npanic disorder if their parents have the disorder (Biederman et al., 2001), and family and twins studies\nindicate that the heritability of panic disorder is around 43% (Hettema, Neale, & Kendler, 2001). The\nexactgenesandgenefunctionsinvolvedinthisdisorder,however,arenotwell-understood(APA,2013).\nNeurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus\nmayplayaroleinthisdisorder.Locatedinthebrainstem,thelocuscoeruleusisthebrain\u2019smajorsource\nof norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that triggers the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response. Activation of the\nlocus coeruleus is associated with anxiety and fear, and research with nonhuman primates has shown\nthat stimulating the locus coeruleus either electrically or through drugs produces panic-like symptoms\n(Charneyetal.,1990).Suchfindingshaveledtothetheorythatpanicdisordermaybecausedbyabnormal\nnorepinephrine activity in the locus coeruleus (Bremner, Krystal, Southwick, & Charney, 1996).\nConditioningtheoriesofpanicdisorderproposethatpanicattacksareclassicalconditioningresponsesto\nsubtlebodilysensationsresemblingthosenormallyoccurringwhenoneisanxiousorfrightened(Bouton,\nMineka,&Barlow,2001).Forexample,considerachildwhohasasthma.Anacuteasthmaattackproduces\nsensations,suchasshortnessofbreath,coughing,andchesttightness,thattypicallyelicitfearandanxiety.\nLater, when the child experiences subtle symptoms that resemble the frightening symptoms of earlier\nasthmaattacks(suchasshortnessofbreathafterclimbingstairs),hemaybecomeanxious,fearful,andthen\nexperienceapanicattack.Inthissituation,thesubtlesymptomswouldrepresentaconditionedstimulus,\nandthepanicattackwouldbeaconditionedresponse.Thefindingthatpanicdisorderisnearlythreetimes\nasfrequentamongpeoplewithasthmaasitisamongpeoplewithoutasthma(Weiser,2007)supportsthe\npossibility that panic disorder has the potential to develop through classical conditioning.\nCognitive factors may play an integral part in panic disorder. Generally, cognitive theories (Clark, 1996)\nargue that those with panic disorder are prone to interpret ordinary bodily sensations catastrophically,\nand these fearful interpretations set the stage for panic attacks. For example, a person might detect\nbodily changes that are routinely triggered by innocuous events such getting up from a seated position\n(dizziness), exercising (increased heart rate, shortness of breath), or drinking a large cup of coffee\n(increased heart rate, trembling). The individual interprets these subtle bodily changes catastrophically\n(\u201cMaybeI\u2019mhavingaheartattack!\u201d).Suchinterpretationscreatefearandanxiety,whichtriggeradditional\nphysicalsymptoms;subsequently,thepersonexperiencesapanicattack.Supportofthiscontentionrests\nwith findings that people with more severe catastrophic thoughts about sensations have more frequent\nand severe panic attacks, and among those with panic disorder, reducing catastrophic cognitions about\ntheir sensations is as effective as medication in reducing panic attacks (Good & Hinton, 2009).\nGENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER\nAlexwasalwaysworriedaboutmanythings.Heworriedthathischildrenwoulddrownwhentheyplayed\nat the beach.

These perceived\nphysical defects cause the person to think she is unattractive, ugly, hideous, or deformed. These\npreoccupations can focus on any bodily area, but they typically involve the skin, face, or hair. The\npreoccupation with imagined physical flaws drives the person to engage in repetitive and ritualistic\nbehavioral and mental acts, such as constantly looking in the mirror, trying to hide the offending body\npart,comparisonswithothers,and,insomeextremecases,cosmeticsurgery(Phillips,2005).Anestimated\n2.4%oftheadultsintheUnitedStatesmeetthecriteriaforbodydysmorphicdisorder,withslightlyhigher\nrates in women than in men (APA, 2013). 558 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nHOARDING DISORDER\nAlthoughhoardingwastraditionallyconsideredtobeasymptomofOCD,considerableevidencesuggests\nthat hoarding represents an entirely different disorder (Mataix-Cols et al., 2010). People with hoarding\ndisorder cannot bear to part with personal possessions, regardless of how valueless or useless these\npossessions are. As a result, these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items\nthat clutter their living areas (Figure 15.12). Often, the quantity of cluttered items is so excessive that\nthepersonisunableusehiskitchen,orsleepinhisbed.Peoplewhosufferfromthisdisorderhavegreat\ndifficulty parting with items because they believe the items might be of some later use, or because they\nformasentimentalattachmenttotheitems(APA,2013).Importantly,adiagnosisofhoardingdisorderis\nmadeonlyifthehoardingisnotcausedbyanothermedicalconditionandifthehoardingisnotasymptom\nof another disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) (APA, 2013).\nFigure 15.12 Those who suffer from hoarding disorder have great difficulty in discarding possessions, usually\nresulting in an accumulation of items that clutter living or work areas.

Nearly 21% of residents of areas affected by Hurricane\nKatrinasufferedfromPTSDoneyearfollowingthehurricane(Kessleretal.,2008),and12.6%ofManhattan\nresidents were observed as having PTSD 2\u20133 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks (DiGrande et al., 2008).\nRISK FACTORS FOR PTSD\nOf course, not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will go on to develop PTSD; several factors\nstronglypredictthedevelopmentofPTSD:traumaexperience,greatertraumaseverity,lackofimmediate\nsocial support, and more subsequent life stress (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). Traumatic events\nthat involve harm by others (e.g., combat, rape, and sexual molestation) carry greater risk than do other\ntraumas(e.g.,naturaldisasters)(Kessler,Sonnega,Bromet,Hughes,&Nelson,1995).Factorsthatincrease\nthe risk of PTSD include female gender, low socioeconomic status, low intelligence, personal history of\nmental disorders, history of childhood adversity (abuse or other trauma during childhood), and family\nhistory of mental disorders (Brewin et al., 2000). Personality characteristics such as neuroticism and\nsomatization (the tendency to experience physical symptoms when one encounters stress) have been\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 561\nshowntoelevatetheriskofPTSD(Bramsen,Dirkzwager,&vanderPloeg,2000).Peoplewhoexperience\nchildhood adversity and/or traumatic experiences during adulthood are at significantly higher risk of\ndeveloping PTSD if they possess one or two short versions of a gene that regulates the neurotransmitter\nserotonin(Xieetal.,2009).Thissuggestsapossiblediathesis-stressinterpretationofPTSD:itsdevelopment\nis influenced by the interaction of psychosocial and biological factors.\nSUPPORT FOR SUFFERERS OF PTSD\nResearch has shown that social support following a traumatic event can reduce the likelihood of PTSD\n(Ozer, Best, Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). Social support is often defined as the comfort, advice, and assistance\nreceived from relatives, friends, and neighbors. Social support can help individuals cope during difficult\ntimes by allowing them to discuss feelings and experiences and providing a sense of being loved and\nappreciated.A14-yearstudyof1,377AmericanLegionnaireswhohadservedintheVietnamWarfound\nthat those who perceived less social support when they came home were more likely to develop PTSD\nthan were those who perceived greater support (Figure 15.14).

(credit: Kevin\nStanchfield)\nLEARNING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PTSD\nPTSD learning models suggest that some symptoms are developed and maintained through classical\nconditioning. The traumatic event may act as an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an unconditioned\nresponse characterized by extreme fear and anxiety. Cognitive, emotional, physiological, and\nenvironmental cues accompanying or related to the event are conditioned stimuli. These traumatic 562 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nreminders evoke conditioned responses (extreme fear and anxiety) similar to those caused by the event\nitself(Nader,2001).ApersonwhowasinthevicinityoftheTwinTowersduringthe9/11terroristattacks\nand who developed PTSD may display excessive hypervigilance and distress when planes fly overhead;\nthis behavior constitutes a conditioned response to the traumatic reminder (conditioned stimulus of\nthe sight and sound of an airplane). Differences in how conditionable individuals are help to explain\ndifferencesinthedevelopmentandmaintenanceofPTSDsymptoms(Pittman,1988).Conditioningstudies\ndemonstrate facilitated acquisition of conditioned responses and delayed extinction of conditioned\nresponses in people with PTSD (Orr et al., 2000).\nCognitive factors are important in the development and maintenance of PTSD. One model suggests that\ntwokeyprocessesarecrucial:disturbancesinmemoryfortheevent,andnegativeappraisalsofthetrauma\nanditsaftermath(Ehlers&Clark,2000).Accordingtothistheory,somepeoplewhoexperiencetraumasdo\nnotformcoherentmemoriesofthetrauma;memoriesofthetraumaticeventarepoorlyencodedand,thus,\nare fragmented, disorganized, and lacking in detail. Therefore, these individuals are unable remember\nthe event in a way that gives it meaning and context.

Depressive disorders vary by degree, but this chapter\nhighlights the most well-known: major depressive disorder (sometimes called unipolar depression).\nBipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature. Mania\nis a state of extreme elation and agitation. When people experience mania, they may become extremely\ntalkative, behave recklessly, or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously. The most recognized of\nthese disorders is bipolar disorder.\nMAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER\nAccordingtotheDSM-5,thedefiningsymptomsofmajordepressivedisorderinclude\u201cdepressedmood\nmost of the day, nearly every day\u201d (feeling sad, empty, hopeless, or appearing tearful to others), and\nloss of interest and pleasure in usual activities (APA, 2013). In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad\nmost of each day, people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that\npreviously weregratifying,suchashobbies, sports, sex,social events,timespentwithfamily,andsoon.\nFriends and family members may notice that the person has completely abandoned previously enjoyed\nhobbies;forexample,anavidtennisplayerwhodevelopsmajordepressivedisordernolongerplaystennis\n(Rothschild, 1999).\nTo receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, one must experience a total of five symptoms for at\nleast a two-week period; these symptoms must cause significant distress or impair normal functioning,\nand they must not be caused by substances or a medical condition. At least one of the two symptoms\nmentioned above must be present, plus any combination of the following symptoms (APA, 2013):\n\u2022 significantweightloss(whennotdieting)orweightgainand/orsignificantdecreaseorincreasein\nappetite; 564 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\n\u2022 difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much;\n\u2022 psychomotoragitation(thepersonisnoticeablyfidgetyandjittery,demonstratedbybehaviorslike\ntheinabilitytosit,pacing,hand-wringing,pullingorrubbingoftheskin,clothing,orotherobjects)\nor psychomotor retardation (the person talks and moves slowly, for example, talking softly, very\nlittle, or in a monotone);\n\u2022 fatigue or loss of energy;\n\u2022 feelings of worthlessness or guilt;\n\u2022 difficulty concentrating and indecisiveness; and\n\u2022 suicidalideation:thoughtsofdeath(notjustfearofdying),thinkingaboutorplanningsuicide,or\nmaking an actual suicide attempt.\nMajor depressive disorder is considered episodic: its symptoms are typically present at their full\nmagnitudeforacertainperiodoftimeandthengraduallyabate.Approximately50%\u201360%ofpeoplewho\nexperienceanepisodeofmajordepressivedisorderwillhaveasecondepisodeatsomepointinthefuture;\nthosewhohavehadtwoepisodeshavea70%chanceofhavingathirdepisode,andthosewhohavehad\nthree episodes have a 90% chance of having a fourth episode (Rothschild, 1999).

In the long-term, many who do\nrecover will still show minor symptoms that fluctuate in their severity (Judd, 2012).\nResults of Major Depressive Disorder\nMajor depressive disorder is a serious and incapacitating condition that can have a devastating effect on\nthequalityofone\u2019slife.Thepersonsufferingfromthisdisorderlivesaprofoundlymiserableexistencethat\noftenresultsinunavailabilityforworkoreducation,abandonmentofpromisingcareers,andlostwages;\noccasionally,theconditionrequireshospitalization.Themajorityofthosewithmajordepressivedisorder\nreport having faced some kind of discrimination, and many report that having received such treatment\nhas stopped them from initiating close relationships, applying for jobs for which they are qualified, and\napplying for education or training (Lasalvia et al., 2013). Major depressive disorder also takes a toll on\nhealth. Depression is a risk factor for the development of heart disease in healthy patients, as well as\nadverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with preexisting heart disease (Whooley, 2006).\nRisk Factors for Major Depressive Disorder\nMajordepressivedisorderisoftenreferredtoasthecommoncoldofpsychiatricdisorders.Around6.6%\noftheU.S.populationexperiencesmajordepressivedisordereachyear;16.9%willexperiencethedisorder\nduringtheirlifetime(Kessler&Wang,2009).Itismorecommonamongwomenthanamongmen,affecting\napproximately 20% of women and 13% of men atsome point intheirlife(National Comorbidity Survey,\n2007). The greater risk among women is not accounted for by a tendency to report symptoms or to seek\nhelpmorereadily,suggestingthatgenderdifferencesintheratesofmajordepressivedisordermayreflect\nbiological and gender-related environmental experiences (Kessler, 2003).\nLifetime rates of major depressive disorder tend to be highest in North and South America, Europe, and\nAustralia; they are considerably lower in Asian countries (Hasin, Fenton, & Weissman, 2011). The rates\nof major depressive disorder are higher among younger age cohorts than among older cohorts, perhaps\nbecause people in younger age cohorts are more willing to admit depression (Kessler & Wang, 2009).\nA number of risk factors are associated with major depressive disorder: unemployment (including\nhomemakers); earning less than $20,000 per year; living in urban areas; or being separated, divorced, or\nwidowed(Hasinetal.,2011).Comorbiddisordersincludeanxietydisordersandsubstanceabusedisorders\n(Kessler & Wang, 2009).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 565\nSUBTYPES OF DEPRESSION\nThe DSM-5 lists several different subtypes of depression. These subtypes\u2014what the DSM-5 refer to as\nspecifiers\u2014arenotspecificdisorders;rather,theyarelabelsusedtoindicatespecificpatternsofsymptoms\nor to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present. One subtype, seasonal\npattern, applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder\nonlyduringaparticulartimeofyear(e.g.,fallorwinter).Ineverydaylanguage,peopleoftenrefertothis\nsubtype as the winter blues.\nAnothersubtype,peripartumonset(commonlyreferredtoaspostpartumdepression),appliestowomen\nwhoexperiencemajordepressionduringpregnancyorinthefourweeksfollowingthebirthoftheirchild\n(APA,2013).Thesewomenoftenfeelveryanxiousandmayevenhavepanicattacks.Theymayfeelguilty,\nagitated,andbeweepy.Theymaynotwanttoholdorcarefortheirnewborn,evenincasesinwhichthe\npregnancywasdesiredandintended.Inextremecases,themothermayhavefeelingsofwantingtoharm\nher child or herself. In a horrific illustration, a woman named Andrea Yates, who suffered from extreme\nperipartum-onset depression (as well as other mental illnesses), drowned her five children in a bathtub\n(Roche,2002).Mostwomenwithperipartum-onsetdepressiondonotphysicallyharmtheirchildren,but\nmost do have difficulty being adequate caregivers (Fields, 2010). A surprisingly high number of women\nexperiencesymptomsofperipartum-onsetdepression.Astudyof10,000womenwhohadrecentlygiven\nbirth found that 14% screened positive for peripartum-onset depression, and that nearly 20% reported\nhaving thoughts of wanting to harm themselves (Wisner et al., 2013).\nPeople with persistent depressive disorder (previously known as dysthymia) experience depressed\nmoods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years, as well as at least two of the other\nsymptoms of major depressive disorder. People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad\nand melancholy, but do not meet all the criteria for major depression. However, episodes of full-blown\nmajor depressive disorder can occur during persistent depressive disorder (APA, 2013).\nBIPOLAR DISORDER\nA person with bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic depression) often experiences mood states\nthat vacillate between depression and mania; that is, the person\u2019s mood is said to alternate from one\nemotional extreme to the other (in contrast to unipolar, which indicates a persistently sad mood).\nTo be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in\nhis life; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder, they are not required for a\ndiagnosis (APA, 2013). According to the DSM-5, a manic episode is characterized as a \u201cdistinct period\nof abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently\nincreased activity or energy lasting at least one week,\u201d that lasts most of the time each day (APA, 2013,\np.124).Duringamanicepisode,someexperienceamoodthatisalmosteuphoricandbecomeexcessively\ntalkative, sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers; others become excessively\nirritable and complain or make hostile comments. The person may talk loudly and rapidly, exhibiting\nflight of ideas, abruptly switching from one topic to another. These individuals are easily distracted,\nwhich can make a conversation very difficult. They may exhibit grandiosity, in which they experience\ninflated but unjustified self-esteem and self-confidence. For example, they might quit a job in order to\n\u201cstrike it rich\u201d in the stock market, despite lacking the knowledge, experience, and capital for such an\nendeavor.Theymaytakeonseveraltasksatthesametime(e.g.,severaltime-consumingprojectsatwork)\nandyetshowlittle,ifany,needforsleep;somemaygofordayswithoutsleep.Patientsmayalsorecklessly\nengageinpleasurableactivitiesthatcouldhaveharmfulconsequences,includingspendingsprees,reckless\ndriving,makingfoolishinvestments,excessivegambling,orengaginginsexualencounterswithstrangers\n(APA, 2013).\nDuring a manic episode, individuals usually feel as though they are not ill and do not need treatment.\nHowever, the reckless behaviors that often accompany these episodes\u2014which can be antisocial, illegal,\nor physically threatening to others\u2014may require involuntary hospitalization (APA, 2013). Some patients 566 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nwithbipolardisorderwillexperiencearapid-cyclingsubtype,whichischaracterizedbyatleastfourmanic\nepisodes (or some combination of at least four manic and major depressive episodes) within one year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn the 1997 independent filmSweetheart, actress Janeane Garofalo plays the part of\nJasmine, a young woman with bipolar disorder. Watchthis video\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sweetheart)to see a portion of this film in which\nJasmine experiences a manic episode.\nRisk Factors for Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is considerably less frequent than major depressive disorder. In the United States, 1\nout of every 167 people meets the criteria for bipolar disorder each year, and 1 out of 100 meet the\ncriteria within their lifetime (Merikangas et al., 2011). The rates are higher in men than in women,\nand about half of those with this disorder report onset before the age of 25 (Merikangas et al., 2011).\nAround 90% of those with bipolar disorder have a comorbid disorder, most often an anxiety disorder or\na substance abuse problem. Unfortunately, close to half of the people suffering from bipolar disorder do\nnot receive treatment (Merikangas & Tohen, 2011). Suicide rates are extremely high among those with\nbipolardisorder:around36%ofindividualswiththisdisorderattemptsuicideatleastonceintheirlifetime\n(Novick, Swartz, & Frank, 2010), and between 15%\u201319% complete suicide (Newman, 2004).\nTHE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF MOOD DISORDERS\nMood disorders have been shown to have a strong genetic and biological basis. Relatives of those with\nmajordepressivedisorderhavedoubletheriskofdevelopingmajordepressivedisorder,whereasrelatives\nof patients with bipolar disorder have over nine times the risk (Merikangas et al., 2011). The rate of\nconcordance for major depressive disorder is higher among identical twins than fraternal twins (50% vs.\n38%,respectively),asisthatofbipolardisorder(67%vs.16%,respectively),suggestingthatgeneticfactors\nplay a stronger role in bipolar disorder than in major depressive disorder (Merikangas et al. 2011).\nPeople with mood disorders often have imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, particularly\nnorepinephrine and serotonin (Thase, 2009). These neurotransmitters are important regulators of the\nbodily functions that are disrupted in mood disorders, including appetite, sex drive, sleep, arousal,\nand mood. Medications that are used to treat major depressive disorder typically boost serotonin and\nnorepinephrine activity, whereas lithium\u2014used in the treatment of bipolar disorder\u2014blocks\nnorepinephrine activity at the synapses (Figure 15.16).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 567\nFigure 15.16 Many medications designed to treat mood disorders work by altering neurotransmitter activity in the\nneural synapse.\nDepression is linked to abnormal activity in several regions of the brain (Fitzgerald, Laird, Maller, &\nDaskalakis, 2008) including those important in assessing the emotional significance of stimuli and\nexperiencingemotions(amygdala),andinregulatingandcontrollingemotions(liketheprefrontalcortex,\nor PFC) (LeMoult, Castonguay, Joormann, & McAleavey, 2013). Depressed individuals show elevated\namygdalaactivity(Drevets,Bogers,&Raichle,2002),especiallywhenpresentedwithnegativeemotional\nstimuli, such as photos of sad faces (Figure 15.17) (Surguladze et al., 2005). Interestingly, heightened\namygdalaactivationtonegativeemotionalstimuliamongdepressedpersonsoccursevenwhenstimuliare\npresentedoutsideofconsciousawareness(Victor,Furey,Fromm,\u00d6hman,&Drevets,2010),anditpersists\neven after the negative emotional stimuli are no longer present (Siegle, Thompson, Carter, Steinhauer, &\nThase,2007).Additionally, depressed individuals exhibitlessactivation intheprefrontal,particularlyon\ntheleftside (Davidson, Pizzagalli,& Nitschke, 2009).Because thePFC can dampen amygdala activation,\nthereby enabling one to suppress negative emotions (Phan et al., 2005), decreased activation in certain\nregions of the PFC may inhibit its ability to override negative emotions that might then lead to more\nnegative mood states (Davidson et al., 2009). These findings suggest that depressed persons are more\nprone to react to emotionally negative stimuli, yet have greater difficulty controlling these reactions. 568 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nFigure 15.17 Depressed individuals react to negative emotional stimuli, such as sad faces, with greater amygdala\nactivation than do non-depressed individuals. (credit: Ian Munroe)\nSince the 1950s, researchers have noted that depressed individuals have abnormal levels of cortisol, a\nstress hormone released into the blood by the neuroendocrine system during times of stress (Mackin\n& Young, 2004). When cortisol is released, the body initiates a fight-or-flight response in reaction to a\nthreat or danger. Many people with depression show elevated cortisol levels (Holsboer & Ising, 2010),\nespecially those reporting a history of early life trauma such as the loss of a parent or abuse during\nchildhood (Baes, Tofoli, Martins, & Juruena, 2012). Such findings raise the question of whether high\ncortisol levels are a cause or a consequence of depression. High levels of cortisol are a risk factor for\nfuture depression (Halligan, Herbert, Goodyer, & Murray, 2007), and cortisol activates activity in the\namygdalawhiledeactivatingactivityinthePFC(McEwen,2005)\u2014bothbraindisturbancesareconnected\nto depression. Thus, high cortisol levels may have a causal effect on depression, as well as on its brain\nfunction abnormalities (van Praag, 2005). Also, because stress results in increased cortisol release\n(Michaud,Matheson,Kelly,Anisman,2008),itisequallyreasonabletoassumethatstressmayprecipitate\ndepression.\nA Diathesis-Stress Model and Major Depressive Disorders\nIndeed, it has long been believed that stressful life events can trigger depression, and research has\nconsistentlysupportedthisconclusion(Mazure,1998).Stressfullifeeventsincludesignificantlosses,such\nas death of a loved one, divorce or separation, and serious health and money problems; life events\nsuch as these often precede the onset of depressive episodes (Brown & Harris, 1989). In particular, exit\nevents\u2014instances in which an important person departs (e.g., a death, divorce or separation, or a family\nmember leaving home)\u2014often occur prior to an episode (Paykel, 2003). Exit events are especially likely\nto trigger depression if these happenings occur in a way that humiliates or devalues the individual. For\nexample,peoplewhoexperiencethebreakupofarelationshipinitiatedbytheotherpersondevelopmajor\ndepressive disorder at a rate more than 2 times that of people who experience the death of a loved one\n(Kendler, Hettema, Butera, Gardner, & Prescott, 2003).\nLikewise, individuals who are exposed to traumatic stress during childhood\u2014such as separation from\na parent, family turmoil, and maltreatment (physical or sexual abuse)\u2014are at a heightened risk of\ndeveloping depression at any point in their lives (Kessler, 1997). A recent review of 16 studies involving\nover23,000subjectsconcludedthatthosewhoexperiencechildhoodmaltreatmentaremorethan2times\nas likely to develop recurring and persistent depression (Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012).\nOf course, not everyone who experiences stressful life events or childhood adversities succumbs to\ndepression\u2014indeed,mostdonot.Clearly,adiathesis-stressinterpretationofmajordepressivedisorder,in\nwhichcertainpredispositionsorvulnerabilityfactorsinfluenceone\u2019sreactiontostress,wouldseemlogical.\nIfso,whatmightsuchpredispositionsbe?AstudybyCaspiandothers(2003)suggeststhatanalteration\ninaspecificgenethatregulatesserotonin(the5-HTTLPRgene)mightbeoneculprit.Theseinvestigators\nfoundthatpeoplewhoexperiencedseveralstressfullifeeventsweresignificantlymorelikelytoexperience\nepisodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried\ntwo long versions.

Thus, genetic\nvulnerability may be one mechanism through which stress potentially leads to depression.\nFigure 15.18 A study on gene-environment interaction in people experiencing chronic depression in adulthood\nsuggests a much higher incidence in individuals with a short version of the gene in combination with childhood\nmaltreatment (Brown & Harris, 2013).\nCognitive Theories of Depression\nCognitive theories of depression take the view that depression is triggered by negative thoughts,\ninterpretations,self-evaluations,andexpectations(Joormann,2009).Thesediathesis-stressmodelspropose\nthat depression is triggered by a \u201ccognitive vulnerability\u201d (negative and maladaptive thinking) and by\nprecipitating stressful life events (Gotlib & Joormann, 2010). Perhaps the most well-known cognitive\ntheoryofdepressionwasdevelopedinthe1960sbypsychiatristAaronBeck,basedonclinicalobservations\nand supported byresearch (Beck, 2008).Beck theorized thatdepression-prone people possess depressive\nschemas,ormentalpredispositionstothinkaboutmostthingsinanegativeway(Beck,1976).Depressive\nschemascontainthemesofloss,failure,rejection,worthlessness,andinadequacy,andmaydevelopearly\ninchildhoodinresponsetoadverseexperiences,thenremaindormantuntiltheyareactivatedbystressful\nor negative life events. Depressive schemas prompt dysfunctional and pessimistic thoughts about the\nself, the world, and the future. Beck believed that this dysfunctional style of thinking is maintained by\ncognitive biases, or errors in how we process information about ourselves, which lead us to focus on\nnegative aspects of experiences, interpret things negatively, and block positive memories (Beck, 2008). A\npersonwhosedepressiveschemaconsistsofathemeofrejectionmightbeoverlyattentivetosocialcuesof\nrejection(morelikelytonoticeanother\u2019sfrown),andhemightinterpretthiscueasasignofrejectionand\nautomatically remember past incidents of rejection. Longitudinal studies have supported Beck\u2019s theory,\ninshowingthatapreexistingtendencytoengageinthisnegative,self-defeatingstyleofthinking\u2014when\ncombined with life stress\u2014over time predicts the onset of depression (Dozois & Beck, 2008). Cognitive\ntherapiesfordepression,aimedatchangingadepressedperson\u2019snegativethinking,weredevelopedasan\nexpansion of this theory (Beck, 1976).\nAnothercognitivetheoryofdepression,hopelessnesstheory,postulatesthataparticularstyleofnegative\nthinkingleadstoasenseofhopelessness,whichthenleadstodepression(Abramson,Metalsky,&Alloy,\n1989). According to this theory, hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or 570 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nthat desired outcomes will not occur, and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes. A key\nassumption of this theory is that hopelessness stems from a tendency to perceive negative life events\nas having stable (\u201cIt\u2019s never going to change\u201d) and global (\u201cIt\u2019s going to affect my whole life\u201d) causes,\nin contrast to unstable (\u201cIt\u2019s fixable\u201d) and specific (\u201cIt applies only to this particular situation\u201d) causes,\nespecially if these negative life events occur in important life realms, such as relationships, academic\nachievement,andthelike.Supposeastudentwhowishestogotolawschooldoespoorlyonanadmissions\ntest.Ifthestudentinfersnegativelifeeventsashavingstableandglobalcauses,shemaybelievethather\npoor performance has a stable and global cause (\u201cI lack intelligence, and it\u2019s going to prevent me from\neverfindingameaningfulcareer\u201d),asopposedtoanunstableandspecificcause(\u201cIwassickthedayofthe\nexam,somylowscorewasafluke\u201d).Hopelessnesstheorypredictsthatpeoplewhoexhibitthiscognitive\nstyleinresponsetoundesirablelifeeventswillviewsucheventsashavingnegativeimplicationsfortheir\nfutureandself-worth,therebyincreasingthelikelihoodofhopelessness\u2014theprimarycauseofdepression\n(Abramson et al., 1989). One study testing hopelessness theory measured the tendency to make negative\ninferences for bad life effects in participants who were experiencing uncontrollable stressors. Over the\nensuing six months, those with scores reflecting high cognitive vulnerability were 7 times more likely to\ndevelop depression compared to those with lower scores (Kleim, Gonzalo, & Ehlers, 2011).\nA third cognitive theory of depression focuses on how people\u2019s thoughts about their distressed\nmoods\u2014depressedsymptomsinparticular\u2014canincreasetheriskanddurationofdepression.Thistheory,\nwhich focuses on rumination in the development of depression, was first described in the late 1980s to\nexplain the higher rates of depression in women than in men (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987). Rumination is\nthe repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms,\nratherthatdistractingone\u2019sselffromthesymptomsorattemptingtoaddresstheminanactive,problem-\nsolving manner (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). When people ruminate, they have thoughts such as \u201cWhy am\nI so unmotivated? I just can\u2019t get going. I\u2019m never going to get my work done feeling this way\u201d (Nolen-\nHoeksema & Hilt, 2009, p. 393). Women are more likely than men to ruminate when they are sad or\ndepressed(Butler&Nolen-Hoeksema,1994),andthetendencytoruminateisassociatedwithincreasesin\ndepression symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, & Grayson, 1999), heightened risk of major depressive\nepisodes (Abela & Hankin, 2011), and chronicity of such episodes (Robinson & Alloy, 2003)\nSUICIDE\nForsomepeoplewithmooddisorders,theextremeemotionalpaintheyexperiencebecomesunendurable.\nOverwhelmedbyhopelessness,devastatedbyincapacitatingfeelingsofworthlessness,andburdenedwith\nthe inability to adequately cope with such feelings, they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way\nout.Suicide,definedbytheCDCas\u201cdeathcausedbyself-directedinjuriousbehaviorwithanyintentto\ndie as the result of the behavior\u201d (CDC, 2013a), in a sense represents an outcome of several things going\nwrong all at the same time Crosby, Ortega, & Melanson, 2011). Not only must the person be biologically\nor psychologically vulnerable, but he must also have the means to perform the suicidal act, and he must\nlack the necessary protective factors (e.g., social support from friends and family, religion, coping skills,\nand problem-solving skills) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great\npsychological pain (Berman, 2009).\nSuicide is not listed as a disorder in the DSM-5; however, suffering from a mental disorder\u2014especially\na mood disorder\u2014poses the greatest risk for suicide. Around 90% of those who complete suicides have\na diagnosis of at least one mental disorder, with mood disorders being the most frequent (Fleischman,\nBertolote,Belfer,&Beautrais,2005).Infact,theassociationbetweenmajordepressivedisorderandsuicide\nis so strong that one of the criteria for the disorder is thoughts of suicide, as discussed above (APA, 2013).\nSuicideratescanbedifficulttointerpretbecausesomedeathsthatappeartobeaccidentalmayinfactbe\nactsofsuicide(e.g.,automobilecrash).Nevertheless,investigationsintoU.S.suiciderateshaveuncovered\nthese facts:\n\u2022 Suicide was the 10th leading cause of death for all ages in 2010 (Centers for Disease Control and\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 571\nPrevention [CDC], 2012).\n\u2022 There were 38,364 suicides in 2010 in the United States\u2014an average of 105 each day (CDC, 2012).\n\u2022 Suicide among males is 4 times higher than among females and accounts for 79% of all suicides;\nfirearmsarethemostcommonlyusedmethodofsuicideformales,whereaspoisoningisthemost\ncommonly used method for females (CDC, 2012).\n\u2022 From 1991 to 2003, suicide rates were consistently higher among those 65 years and older. Since\n2001, however, suicide rates among those ages 25\u201364 have risen consistently, and, since 2006,\nsuicide rates have been greater for those ages 65 and older (CDC, 2013b). This increase in suicide\nrates among middle-aged Americans has prompted concern in some quarters that baby boomers\n(individuals born between 1946\u20131964) who face economic worry and easy access to prescription\nmedication may be particularly vulnerable to suicide (Parker-Pope, 2013).\n\u2022 ThehighestratesofsuicidewithintheUnitedStatesareamongAmericanIndians/Alaskannatives\nand Non-Hispanic Whites (CDC, 2013b).\n\u2022 Suicide rates vary across the United States, with the highest rates consistently found in the\nmountainstatesofthewest(Alaska,Montana,Nevada,Wyoming,Colorado,andIdaho)(Berman,\n2009).\nContrary to popular belief, suicide rates peak during the springtime (April and May), not during the\nholidayseasonorwinter.Infact,suicideratesaregenerallylowestduringthewintermonths(Postolache\net al., 2010).\nRISK FACTORS FOR SUICIDE\nSuicidal risk is especially high among people with substance abuse problems. Individuals with alcohol\ndependence are at 10 times greater risk for suicide than the general population (Wilcox, Conner, &\nCaine,2004).Theriskofsuicidalbehaviorisespeciallyhighamongthosewhohavemadeapriorsuicide\nattempt. Among those who attempt suicide, 16% make another attempt within a year and over 21%\nmake another attempt within four years (Owens, Horrocks, & House, 2002). Suicidal individuals may\nbe at high risk for terminating their life if they have a lethal means in which to act, such as a firearm\nin the home (Brent & Bridge, 2003). Withdrawal from social relationships, feeling as though one is a\nburden to others, and engaging in reckless and risk-taking behaviors may be precursors to suicidal\nbehavior (Berman, 2009). A sense of entrapment or feeling unable to escape one\u2019s miserable feelings or\nexternalcircumstances(e.g.,anabusiverelationshipwithnoperceivedwayout)predictssuicidalbehavior\n(O\u2019Connor, Smyth, Ferguson, Ryan, & Williams, 2013). Tragically, reports of suicides among adolescents\nfollowing instances of cyberbullying have emerged in recent years. In one widely-publicized case a few\nyears ago, Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old Massachusetts high school student, committed suicide following\nincessant harassment and taunting from her classmates via texting and Facebook (McCabe, 2010).\nSuicidescanhaveacontagiouseffectonpeople.Forexample,another\u2019ssuicide,especiallythatofafamily\nmember, heightens one\u2019s risk of suicide (Agerbo, Nordentoft, & Mortensen, 2002). Additionally, widely-\npublicized suicides tend to trigger copycat suicides in some individuals. One study examining suicide\nstatistics in the United States from 1947\u20131967 found that the rates of suicide skyrocketed for the first\nmonthafterasuicidestorywasprintedonthefrontpageoftheNewYorkTimes(Phillips,1974).Austrian\nresearchersfoundasignificantincreaseinthenumberofsuicidesbyfirearmsinthethreeweeksfollowing\nextensive reports in Austria\u2019s largest newspaper of a celebrity suicide by gun (Etzersdorfer, Voracek, &\nSonneck,2004).Areviewof42studiesconcludedthatmediacoverageofcelebritysuicidesismorethan14\ntimesmorelikelytotriggercopycatsuicidesthaniscoverageofnon-celebritysuicides(Stack,2000).This\nreviewalsodemonstratedthatthemediumofcoverageisimportant:televisedstoriesareconsiderablyless\nlikely to prompt a surge in suicides than are newspaper stories. Research suggests that a trend appears\nto be emerging whereby people use online social media to leave suicide notes, although it is not clear\nto what extent suicide notes on such media might induce copycat suicides (Ruder, Hatch, Ampanozi, 572 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nThali,&Fischer,2011).Nevertheless,itisreasonabletoconjecturethatsuicidenotesleftbyindividualson\nsocialmediamayinfluencethedecisionsofothervulnerablepeoplewhoencounterthem(Luxton,June,&\nFairall, 2012).\nOnepossiblecontributingfactorinsuicideisbrainchemistry.Contemporaryneurologicalresearchshows\nthat disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior (Pompili et al., 2010).\nLowlevelsofserotoninpredictfuturesuicideattemptsandsuicidecompletions,andlowlevelshavebeen\nobservedpost-mortemamongsuicidevictims(Mann,2003).Serotonindysfunction,asnotedearlier,isalso\nknowntoplayanimportantroleindepression;lowlevelsofserotoninhavealsobeenlinkedtoaggression\nandimpulsivity(Stanleyetal.,2000).Thecombinationofthesethreecharacteristicsconstitutesapotential\nformula for suicide\u2014especially violent suicide.

A hallucination is a\nperceptualexperiencethatoccursintheabsenceofexternalstimulation.Auditoryhallucinations(hearing\nvoices)occurinroughlytwo-thirdsofpatientswithschizophreniaandarebyfarthemostcommonformof\nhallucination(Andreasen,1987).Thevoicesmaybefamiliarorunfamiliar,theymayhaveaconversation\nor argue,or thevoices may provide arunningcommentary on theperson\u2019s behavior (Tsuang, Farone, &\nGreen, 1999).\nLess common are visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there) and olfactory hallucinations\n(smelling odors that are not actually present).\nDelusions are beliefs that are contrary to reality and are firmly held even in the face of contradictory\nevidence.Manyofusholdbeliefsthatsomewouldconsiderodd,butadelusioniseasilyidentifiedbecause\nit is clearly absurd. A person with schizophrenia may believe that his mother is plotting with the FBI to\npoisonhiscoffee,orthathisneighborisanenemyspywhowantstokillhim.Thesekindsofdelusionsare\nknown as paranoid delusions, which involve the (false) belief that other people or agencies are plotting\ntoharmtheperson.Peoplewithschizophreniaalsomayholdgrandiosedelusions,beliefsthatoneholds\nspecial power, unique knowledge, or is extremely important. For example, the person who claims to\nbe Jesus Christ, or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years, or who claims to be a great\nphilosopherisexperiencinggrandiosedelusions.Otherdelusionsincludethebeliefthatone\u2019sthoughtsare\nbeingremoved(thoughtwithdrawal)orthoughtshavebeenplacedinsideone\u2019shead(thoughtinsertion).\nAnother type of delusion is somatic delusion, which is the belief that something highly abnormal is\nhappening to one\u2019s body (e.g., that one\u2019s kidneys are being eaten by cockroaches).\nDisorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes\u2014usually detected by what\na person says. The person might ramble, exhibit loose associations (jump from topic to topic), or talk\nin a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly\ncombining words. Disorganized thinking is also exhibited by blatantly illogical remarks (e.g., \u201cFenway\nPark is in Boston. I live in Boston. Therefore, I live at Fenway Park.\u201d) and by tangentiality: responding\nto others\u2019 statements or questions by remarks that are either barely related or unrelated to what was\nsaid or asked. For example, if a person diagnosed with schizophrenia is asked if she is interested in\nreceiving special job training, she might state that she once rode on a train somewhere. To a person\nwithschizophrenia,thetangential(slightlyrelated)connectionbetweenjobtrainingandridingatrainare\nsufficient enough to cause such a response.\nDisorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements: becoming\nunusually active, exhibiting silly child-like behaviors (giggling and self-absorbed smiling), engaging in\nrepeated and purposeless movements, or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures. In some cases,\nthepersonwillexhibitcatatonicbehaviors,whichshowdecreasedreactivitytotheenvironment,suchas\nposturing,inwhichthepersonmaintainsarigidandbizarrepostureforlongperiodsoftime,orcatatonic\nstupor, a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior.\nNegative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors,\nemotions, or drives (Green, 2001). A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no\nemotion in his facial expressions, speech, or movements, even when such expressions are normal or\nexpected. Avolition is characterized by a lack of motivation to engage in self-initiated and meaningful\nactivity,includingthemostbasicoftasks,suchasbathingandgrooming.Alogiareferstoreducedspeech\noutput; in simple terms, patients do not say much. Another negative symptom is asociality, or social\nwithdrawalandlackofinterestinengaginginsocialinteractionswithothers.Afinalnegativesymptom,\nanhedonia, refers to an inability to experience pleasure. One who exhibits anhedonia expresses little\ninterest in what most people consider to be pleasurable activities, such as hobbies, recreation, or sexual\nactivity. 574 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Schizo1)and try to identify which\nclassic symptoms of schizophrenia are shown.\nCAUSES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA\nThere is considerable evidence suggesting that schizophrenia has a genetic basis. The risk of developing\nschizophrenia is nearly 6 times greater if one has a parent with schizophrenia than if one does not\n(Goldstein, Buka, Seidman, & Tsuang, 2010). Additionally, one\u2019s risk of developing schizophrenia\nincreases as genetic relatedness to family members diagnosed with schizophrenia increases (Gottesman,\n2001).\nGenes\nWhen considering the role of genetics in schizophrenia, as in any disorder, conclusions based on family\nand twin studies are subject to criticism. This is because family members who are closely related (such\nas siblings) are more likely to share similar environments than are family members who are less closely\nrelated (such as cousins); further, identical twins may be more likely to be treated similarly by others\nthan might fraternal twins. Thus, family and twin studies cannot completely rule out the possible effects\nof shared environments and experiences. Such problems can be corrected by using adoption studies, in\nwhich children are separated from their parents at an early age. One of the first adoption studies of\nschizophreniaconductedbyHeston(1966)followed97adoptees,including47whowereborntomothers\nwithschizophrenia,overa36-yearperiod.Fiveofthe47adoptees(11%)whosemothershadschizophrenia\nwere later diagnosed with schizophrenia, compared to none of the 50 control adoptees. Other adoption\nstudies have consistently reported that for adoptees who are later diagnosed with schizophrenia, their\nbiological relatives have a higher risk of schizophrenia than do adoptive relatives (Shih, Belmonte, &\nZandi, 2004).\nAlthoughadoptionstudieshavesupportedthehypothesisthatgeneticfactorscontributetoschizophrenia,\nthey have also demonstrated that the disorder most likely arises from a combination of genetic and\nenvironmental factors, rather than just genes themselves. For example, investigators in one study\nexaminedtheratesofschizophreniaamong303adoptees(Tienarietal.,2004).Atotalof145oftheadoptees\nhad biological mothers with schizophrenia; these adoptees constituted the high genetic risk group. The\nother 158 adoptees had mothers with no psychiatric history; these adoptees composed the low genetic\nrisk group. The researchers managed to determine whether the adoptees\u2019 families were either healthy or\ndisturbed. For example, the adoptees were considered to be raised in a disturbed family environment if\nthefamilyexhibitedalotofcriticism,conflict,andalackofproblem-solvingskills.Thefindingsrevealed\nthatadopteeswhosemothershadschizophrenia(highgeneticrisk)andwhohadbeenraisedinadisturbed\nfamily environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder\n(36.8%) than were adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia but who had been raised in a\nhealthyenvironment(5.8%),orthanadopteeswithalowgeneticriskwhowereraisedineitheradisturbed\n(5.3%) or healthy (4.8%) environment. Because the adoptees who were at high genetic risk were likely to\ndevelop schizophrenia only if they were raised in a disturbed home environment, this study supports a\ndiathesis-stress interpretation of schizophrenia\u2014both genetic vulnerability and environmental stress are\nnecessary for schizophrenia to develop, genes alone do not show the complete picture.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 575\nNeurotransmitters\nIf we accept that schizophrenia is at least partly genetic in origin, as it seems to be, it makes sense\nthat the next step should be to identify biological abnormalities commonly found in people with the\ndisorder. Perhaps not surprisingly, a number of neurobiological factors have indeed been found to be\nrelated to schizophrenia. One such factor that has received considerable attention for many years is the\nneurotransmitter dopamine. Interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two\nsets of findings: drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia-like symptoms, and\nmedications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms (Howes & Kapur, 2009). The dopamine\nhypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine\nreceptorsareresponsiblefortheonsetandmaintenanceofschizophrenia(Snyder,1976).Morerecentwork\ninthisareasuggeststhatabnormalitiesindopaminevarybybrainregionandthuscontributetosymptoms\ninuniqueways.Ingeneral,thisresearchhassuggestedthatanoverabundanceofdopamineinthelimbic\nsystemmayberesponsibleforsomesymptoms,suchashallucinationsanddelusions,whereaslowlevels\nofdopamineintheprefrontalcortexmightberesponsibleprimarilyforthenegativesymptoms(avolition,\nalogia, asociality, and anhedonia) (Davis, Kahn, Ko, & Davidson, 1991). In recent years, serotonin has\nreceived attention, and newer antipsychotic medications used to treat the disorder work by blocking\nserotonin receptors (Baumeister & Hawkins, 2004).\nBrain Anatomy\nBrainimagingstudiesrevealthatpeoplewithschizophreniahaveenlargedventricles,thecavitieswithin\nthe brain that contain cerebral spinal fluid (Green, 2001).

The frontal lobes are\nimportantinavarietyofcomplexcognitivefunctions,suchasplanningandexecutingbehavior,attention,\nspeech,movement,andproblemsolving.Hence,abnormalitiesinthisregionprovidemeritinexplaining\nwhy people with schizophrenia experience deficits in these of areas.\nEvents During Pregnancy\nWhy do people with schizophrenia have these brain abnormalities? A number of environmental factors\nthatcouldimpactnormalbraindevelopmentmightbeatfault.Highratesofobstetriccomplicationsinthe\nbirthsofchildrenwholaterdevelopedschizophreniahavebeenreported(Cannon,Jones,&Murray,2002).\nIn addition, people are at an increased risk for developing schizophrenia if their mother was exposed to\ninfluenza during the first trimester of pregnancy (Brown et al., 2004). Research has also suggested that a\nmother\u2019semotionalstressduringpregnancymayincreasetheriskofschizophreniainoffspring.Onestudy\nreported that the risk of schizophrenia is elevated substantially in offspring whose mothers experienced\nthe death of a relative during the first trimester of pregnancy (Khashan et al., 2008).\nMarijuana\nAnother variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use. Although a number of reports have\nshownthatindividualswithschizophreniaaremorelikelytousemarijuanathanareindividualswithout\nschizophrenia (Thornicroft, 1990), such investigations cannot determine if marijuana use leads to\nschizophrenia, or vice versa. However, a number of longitudinal studies have suggested that marijuana\nuse is, in fact, a risk factor for schizophrenia. A classic investigation of over 45,000 Swedish conscripts\nwho were followed up after 15 years found that those individuals who had reported using marijuana at\nleast once by the time of conscription were more than 2 times as likely to develop schizophrenia during\nthe ensuing 15 years than were those who reported never using marijuana; those who had indicated\nusing marijuana 50 or more times were 6 times as likely to develop schizophrenia (Andr\u00e9asson, Allbeck, 576 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nEngstr\u00f6m, & Rydberg, 1987). More recently, a review of 35 longitudinal studies found a substantially\nincreased risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in people who had used marijuana, with\nthegreatestriskinthemostfrequentusers(Mooreetal.,2007).Otherworkhasfoundthatmarijuanause\nis associated with an onset of psychotic disorders at an earlier age (Large, Sharma, Compton, Slade, &\nNielssen, 2011). Overall, the available evidence seems to indicate that marijuana use plays a causal role\nin the development of schizophrenia, although it is important to point out that marijuana use is not an\nessentialorsufficientriskfactorasnotallpeoplewithschizophreniahaveusedmarijuanaandthemajority\nof marijuana users do not develop schizophrenia (Casadio, Fernandes, Murray, & Di Forti, 2011). One\nplausible interpretation of the data is that early marijuana use may disrupt normal brain development\nduringimportantearlymaturationperiodsinadolescence(Trezza,Cuomo,&Vanderschuren,2008).Thus,\nearlymarijuanausemaysetthestageforthedevelopmentofschizophreniaandotherpsychoticdisorders,\nespecially among individuals with an established vulnerability (Casadio et al., 2011).\nSCHIZOPHRENIA: EARLY WARNING SIGNS\nEarlydetectionandtreatmentofconditionssuchasheartdiseaseandcancerhaveimprovedsurvivalrates\nand quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions. A new approach involves identifying\npeople who show minor symptoms of psychosis, such as unusual thought content, paranoia, odd\ncommunication, delusions, problems at school or work, and a decline in social functioning\u2014which are\ncoined prodromal symptoms\u2014and following these individuals over time to determine which of them\ndevelopapsychoticdisorderandwhichfactorsbestpredictsuchadisorder.Anumberoffactorshavebeen\nidentified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder:\ngenetic risk (a family history of psychosis), recent deterioration in functioning, high levels of unusual\nthought content, high levels of suspicion or paranoia, poor social functioning, and a history of substance\nabuse(Fusar-Polietal.,2013).Furtherresearchwillenableamoreaccuratepredictionofthoseatgreatest\nrisk for developing schizophrenia, and thus to whom early intervention efforts should be directed.\n15.9 Dissociative Disorders\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the essential nature of dissociative disorders\n\u2022 Identify and differentiate the symptoms of dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/\nderealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder\n\u2022 Discuss the potential role of both social and psychological factors in dissociative identity\ndisorder\nDissociative disorders are characterized by an individual becoming split off, or dissociated, from her\ncore sense of self. Memory and identity become disturbed; these disturbances have a psychological\nrather than physical cause. Dissociative disorders listed in the DSM-5 include dissociative amnesia,\ndepersonalization/derealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder.\nDISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA\nAmnesia refers to the partial or total forgetting of some experience or event. An individual with\ndissociative amnesia is unable to recall important personal information, usually following an extremely\nstressful or traumatic experience such as combat, natural disasters, or being the victim of violence. The\nmemoryimpairmentsarenotcausedbyordinaryforgetting.Someindividualswithdissociativeamnesia\nwill also experience dissociative fugue (from the word \u201cto flee\u201d in French), whereby they suddenly\nwander away from their home, experience confusion about their identity, and sometimes even adopt a\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 577\nnew identity (Carde\u00f1a & Gleaves, 2006). Most fugue episodes last only a few hours or days, but some\ncan last longer. One study of residents in communities in upstate New York reported that about 1.8%\nexperienced dissociative amnesia in the previous year (Johnson, Cohen, Kasen, & Brook, 2006).\nSome have questioned the validity of dissociative amnesia (Pope, Hudson, Bodkin, & Oliva, 1998); it\nhas even been characterized as a \u201cpiece of psychiatric folklore devoid of convincing empirical support\u201d\n(McNally, 2003, p. 275). Notably, scientific publications regarding dissociative amnesia rose during the\n1980s and reached a peak in the mid-1990s, followed by an equally sharp decline by 2003; in fact, only\n13 cases of individuals with dissociative amnesia worldwide could be found in the literature that same\nyear (Pope, Barry, Bodkin, & Hudson, 2006). Further, no description of individuals showing dissociative\namnesia following a trauma exists in any fictional or nonfictional work prior to 1800 (Pope, Poliakoff,\nParker, Boynes, & Hudson, 2006). However, a study of 82 individuals who enrolled for treatment at a\npsychiatric outpatient hospital found that nearly 10% met the criteria for dissociative amnesia, perhaps\nsuggesting that the condition is underdiagnosed, especially in psychiatric populations (Foote, Smolin,\nKaplan, Legatt, & Lipschitz, 2006).\nDEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION DISORDER\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization,\nderealization, or both. Depersonalization is defined as feelings of \u201cunreality or detachment from, or\nunfamiliarity with, one\u2019s whole self or from aspects of the self\u201d (APA, 2013, p. 302). Individuals who\nexperience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own; they may feel\nrobotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech; they may experience a distorted\nsense of time and, in extreme cases, they may sense an \u201cout-of-body\u201d experience in which they see\nthemselves from the vantage point of another person. Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of\n\u201cunreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or\nall surroundings\u201d (APA, 2013, p. 303). A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he\nis in a fog or a dream, or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal. Individuals with\ndepersonalization/derealizationdisorderoftenhavedifficultydescribingtheirsymptomsandmaythink\nthey are going crazy (APA, 2013).\nDISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER\nBy far, the most well-known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder (formerly called\nmultiple personality disorder). People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate\npersonalitiesoridentities,eachwell-definedanddistinctfromoneanother.Theyalsoexperiencememory\ngapsforthetimeduringwhichanotheridentityisincharge(e.g.,onemightfindunfamiliaritemsinher\nshoppingbagsoramongherpossessions),andinsomecasesmayreporthearingvoices,suchasachild\u2019s\nvoiceorthesoundofsomebodycrying(APA,2013).ThestudyofupstateNewYorkresidentsmentioned\nabove (Johnson et al., 2006) reported that 1.5% of their sample experienced symptoms consistent with\ndissociative identity disorder in the previous year.\nDissociative identity disorder (DID) is highly controversial. Some believe that people fake symptoms to\navoidtheconsequencesofillegalactions(e.g.,\u201cIamnotresponsibleforshopliftingbecauseitwasmyother\npersonality\u201d).

When these claims were scrutinized, he\nadmitted faking the symptoms and was found guilty (Schwartz, 1981).\nA second reason DID is controversial is because rates of the disorder suddenly skyrocketed in the 1980s.\nMorecasesofDIDwereidentifiedduringthefiveyearspriorto1986thanintheprecedingtwocenturies 578 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\n(Putnam,Guroff,Silberman,Barban,&Post,1986).Althoughthisincreasemaybeduetothedevelopment\nofmoresophisticateddiagnostictechniques,itisalsopossiblethatthepopularizationofDID\u2014helpedin\npart by Sybil, a popular 1970s book (and later film) about a woman with 16 different personalities\u2014may\nhavepromptedclinicianstooverdiagnosethedisorder(Piper&Merskey,2004).Castingfurtherscrutiny\non the existence of multiple personalities or identities is the recent suggestion that the story of Sybil was\nlargely fabricated, and the idea for the book might have been exaggerated (Nathan, 2011).\nDespite its controversial nature, DID is clearly a legitimate and serious disorder, and although some\npeoplemayfakesymptoms,otherssuffertheirentireliveswithit.Peoplewiththisdisordertendtoreport\na history of childhood trauma, some cases having been corroborated through medical or legal records\n(Carde\u00f1a&Gleaves,2006).ResearchbyRossetal.(1990)suggeststhatinonestudyabout95%ofpeople\nwith DID were physically and/or sexually abused as children. Of course, not all reports of childhood\nabusecanbeexpectedtobevalidoraccurate.However,thereisstrongevidencethattraumaticexperiences\ncan cause people to experience states of dissociation, suggesting that dissociative states\u2014including the\nadoption of multiple personalities\u2014may serve as a psychologically important coping mechanism for\nthreat and danger (Dalenberg et al., 2012).\n15.10 Personality Disorders\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the nature of personality disorders and how they differ from other disorders\n\u2022 List and distinguish between the three clusters of personality disorders\n\u2022 Identify the basic features of borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality\ndisorder, and the factors that are important in the etiology of both\nThetermpersonalityreferslooselytoone\u2019sstable,consistent,anddistinctivewayofthinkingabout,feeling,\nacting,andrelatingtotheworld.Peoplewithpersonalitydisordersexhibitapersonalitystylethatdiffers\nmarkedlyfromtheexpectationsoftheirculture,ispervasiveandinflexible,beginsinadolescenceorearly\nadulthood, and causes distress or impairment (APA, 2013).

Cluster A disorders\ninclude paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality\ndisorder. People with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric. Cluster B\ndisorders include antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality\ndisorder, and borderline personality disorder. People with these disorders usually are impulsive, overly\ndramatic, highly emotional, and erratic. Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder,\ndependent personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (which is not the same\nthing as obsessive-compulsive disorder). People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and\nfearful.Table 15.2provides a description of each of the DSM-5 personality disorders:\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 579\nTable 15.2DSM-5 Personality Disorders\nDSM-5\nPersonality Description Cluster\nDisorder\nParanoid harbors a pervasive and unjustifiable suspiciousness and mistrust of A\nothers; reluctant to confide in or become close to others; reads hidden\ndemeaning or threatening meaning into benign remarks or events; takes\noffense easily and bears grudges; not due to schizophrenia or other\npsychotic disorders\nSchizoid lacks interest and desire to form relationships with others; aloof and A\nshows emotional coldness and detachment; indifferent to approval or\ncriticism of others; lacks close friends or confidants; not due to\nschizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, not an autism spectrum\ndisorder\nSchizotypal exhibits eccentricities in thought, perception, emotion, speech, and A\nbehavior; shows suspiciousness or paranoia; has unusual perceptual\nexperiences; speech is often idiosyncratic; displays inappropriate\nemotions; lacks friends or confidants; not due to schizophrenia or other\npsychotic disorder, or to autism spectrum disorder\nAntisocial continuously violates the rights of others; history of antisocial tendencies B\nprior to age 15; often lies, fights, and has problems with the law; impulsive\nand fails to think ahead; can be deceitful and manipulative in order to gain\nprofit or pleasure; irresponsible and often fails to hold down a job or pay\nfinancial debts; lacks feelings for others and remorse over misdeeds\nHistrionic excessively overdramatic, emotional, and theatrical; feels uncomfortable B\nwhen not the center of others\u2019 attention; behavior is often inappropriately\nseductive or provocative; speech is highly emotional but often vague and\ndiffuse; emotions are shallow and often shift rapidly; may alienate friends\nwith demands for constant attention\nNarcissistic overinflated and unjustified sense of self-importance and preoccupied B\nwith fantasies of success; believes he is entitled to special treatment from\nothers; shows arrogant attitudes and behaviors; takes advantage of others;\nlacks empathy\nBorderline unstable in self-image, mood, and behavior; cannot tolerate being alone B\nand experiences chronic feelings of emptiness; unstable and intense\nrelationships with others; behavior is impulsive, unpredictable, and\nsometimes self-damaging; shows inappropriate and intense anger; makes\nsuicidal gestures 580 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nTable 15.2DSM-5 Personality Disorders\nDSM-5\nPersonality Description Cluster\nDisorder\nAvoidant socially inhibited and oversensitive to negative evaluation; avoids C\noccupations that involve interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism\nor rejection; avoids relationships with others unless guaranteed to be\naccepted unconditionally; feels inadequate and views self as socially inept\nand unappealing; unwilling to take risks or engage in new activities if they\nmay prove embarrassing\nDependent allows others to take over and run her life; is submissive, clingy, and fears C\nseparation; cannot make decisions without advice and reassurance from\nothers; lacks self-confidence; cannot do things on her own; feels\nuncomfortable or helpless when alone\nObsessive- pervasive need for perfectionism that interferes with the ability to C\nCompulsive complete tasks; preoccupied with details, rules, order, and schedules;\nexcessively devoted to work at the expense of leisure and friendships;\nrigid, inflexible, and stubborn; insists things be done his way; miserly with\nmoney\nSlightly over 9% of the U.S. population suffers from a personality disorder, with avoidant and schizoid\npersonality disorders the most frequent (Lezenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2007). Two of these\npersonalitydisorders,borderlinepersonalitydisorderandantisocialpersonalitydisorder,areregardedby\nmany as especially problematic.\nBORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER\nThe\u201cborderline\u201dinborderlinepersonalitydisorderwasoriginallycoinedinthelate1930sinaneffortto\ndescribe patients who appeared anxious, but were prone to brief psychotic experiences\u2014that is, patients\nwhowerethoughttobeliterallyontheborderlinebetweenanxietyandpsychosis(Freeman,Stone,Martin,\n&Reinecke,2005).Today,borderlinepersonalitydisorderhasacompletelydifferentmeaning.Borderline\npersonality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and\nmood, as well as marked impulsivity (APA, 2013). People with borderline personality disorder cannot\ntolerate the thought of being alone and will make frantic efforts (including making suicidal gestures\nand engaging in self-mutilation) to avoid abandonment or separation (whether real or imagined). Their\nrelationships are intense and unstable; for example, a lover may be idealized early in a relationship, but\nthen later vilified at the slightest sign she appears to no longer show interest. These individuals have\nan unstable view of self and, thus, might suddenly display a shift in personal attitudes, interests, career\nplans, and choice of friends. For example, a law school student may, despite having invested tens of\nthousands of dollars toward earning a law degree and despite having performed well in the program,\nconsiderdroppingoutandpursuingacareerinanotherfield.Peoplewithborderlinepersonalitydisorder\nmay be highly impulsive and may engage in reckless and self-destructive behaviors such as excessive\ngambling, spending money irresponsibly, substance abuse, engaging in unsafe sex, and reckless driving.\nTheysometimesshowintenseandinappropriateangerthattheyhavedifficultycontrolling,andtheycan\nbe moody, sarcastic, bitter, and verbally abusive.\nThe prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the U.S. population is estimated to be around\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 581\n1.4% (Lezenweger et al., 2007), but the rates are higher among those who use mental health services;\napproximately 10% of mental health outpatients and 20% of psychiatric inpatients meet the criteria for\ndiagnosis(APA,2013).Additionally,borderlinepersonalitydisorderiscomorbidwithanxiety,mood,and\nsubstance use disorders (Lezenweger et al., 2007).\nBiological Basis for Borderline Personality Disorder\nGeneticfactorsappeartobeimportantinthedevelopmentofborderlinepersonalitydisorder.Forexample,\ncorepersonalitytraitsthatcharacterizethisdisorder,suchasimpulsivityandemotionalinstability,show\na high degree of heritability (Livesley, 2008). Also, the rates of borderline personality disorder among\nrelativesofpeoplewiththisdisorderhavebeenfoundtobeashighas24.9%(White,Gunderson,Zanarani,\n& Hudson, 2003). Individuals with borderline personality disorder report experiencing childhood\nphysical,sexual,and/oremotionalabuseatratesfargreaterthanthoseobservedinthegeneralpopulation\n(Afifi et al., 2010), indicating that environmental factors are also crucial. These findings would suggest\nthat borderline personality disorder may be determined by an interaction between genetic factors and\nadverseenvironmentalexperiences.Consistentwiththishypothesis,onestudyfoundthatthehighestrates\nofborderlinepersonalitydisorderwereamongindividualswithaborderlinetemperament(characterized\nby high novelty seeking and high harm-avoidance) and those who experienced childhood abuse and/or\nneglect (Joyce et al., 2003).\nANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER\nMosthumanbeingsliveinaccordancewithamoralcompass,asenseofrightandwrong.Mostindividuals\nlearnataveryyoungagethattherearecertainthingsthatshouldnotbedone.Welearnthatweshouldnot\nlieorcheat.Wearetaughtthatitiswrongtotakethingsthatdonotbelongtous,andthatitiswrongto\nexploitothersforpersonalgain.Wealsolearntheimportanceoflivinguptoourresponsibilities,ofdoing\nwhatwesaywewilldo.Peoplewithantisocialpersonalitydisorder,however,donotseemtohaveamoral\ncompass.Theseindividualsactasthoughtheyneitherhaveasenseofnorcareaboutrightorwrong.Not\nsurprisingly, these people represent a serious problem for others and for society in general.\nAccording to the DSM-5, the individual with antisocial personality disorder (sometimes referred to as\npsychopathy)showsnoregardatallforotherpeople\u2019srightsorfeelings.Thislackofregardisexhibiteda\nnumberofwaysandcanincluderepeatedlyperformingillegalacts,lyingtoorconningothers,impulsivity\nand recklessness, irritability and aggressiveness toward others, and failure to act in a responsible way\n(e.g.,leavingdebtsunpaid)(APA,2013).Theworstpartaboutantisocialpersonalitydisorder,however,is\nthat people with this disorder have no remorse over one\u2019s misdeeds; these people will hurt, manipulate,\nexploit,andabuseothersandnotfeelanyguilt.Signsofthisdisordercanemergeearlyinlife;however,a\nperson must be at least 18 years old to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.\nPeoplewithantisocialpersonalitydisorderseemtoviewtheworldasself-servingandunkind.Theyseem\ntothinkthattheyshouldusewhatevermeansnecessarytogetbyinlife.Theytendtoviewothersnotas\nliving,thinking,feelingbeings,butratheraspawnstobeusedorabusedforaspecificpurpose.Theyoften\nhave an over-inflated sense of themselves and can appear extremely arrogant.

Disinhibition is a\npropensity toward impulse control problems, lack of planning and forethought, insistence on immediate\ngratification, and inability to restrain behavior. Boldness describes a tendency to remain calm in 582 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nthreatening situations, high self-assurance, a sense of dominance, and a tendency toward thrill-seeking.\nMeannessisdefinedas\u201caggressiveresourceseekingwithoutregardforothers,\u201dandissignaledbyalack\nof empathy, disdain for and lack of close relationships with others, and a tendency to accomplish goals\nthrough cruelty (Patrick et al., 2009, p. 913).\nRisk Factors for Antisocial Personality Disorder\nAntisocial personality disorder is observed in about 3.6% of the population; the disorder is much more\ncommon among males, with a 3 to 1 ratio of men to women, and it is more likely to occur in men who\nareyounger,widowed, separated,divorced, oflowersocioeconomic status,wholiveinurbanareas,and\nwholiveinthewesternUnitedStates(Compton,Conway,Stinson,Colliver,&Grant,2005).Comparedto\nmen with antisocial personality disorder, women with the disorder are more likely to have experienced\nemotionalneglectandsexualabuseduringchildhood,andtheyaremorelikelytohavehadparentswho\nabused substances and who engaged in antisocial behaviors themselves (Alegria et al., 2013).\nTable15.3showssomeofthedifferencesinthespecifictypesofantisocialbehaviorsthatmenandwomen\nwith antisocial personality disorder exhibit (Alegria et al., 2013).\nTable 15.3Gender Differences in Antisocial Personality Disorder\nMen with antisocial personality disorder are Women with antisocial personality disorder\nmore likely than women with antisocial are more likely than men with antisocial\npersonality disorder to personality to\n\u2022 do things that could easily hurt themselves or \u2022 run away from home overnight\nothers\n\u2022 frequently miss school or work\n\u2022 receive three or more traffic tickets for reckless\n\u2022 lie frequently\ndriving\n\u2022 forge someone\u2019s signature\n\u2022 have their driver\u2019s license suspended\n\u2022 get into a fight that comes to blows with an\n\u2022 destroy others\u2019 property\nintimate partner\n\u2022 start a fire on purpose\n\u2022 live with others besides the family for at\n\u2022 make money illegally least one month\n\u2022 do anything that could lead to arrest \u2022 harass, threaten, or blackmail someone\n\u2022 hit someone hard enough to injure them\n\u2022 hurt an animal on purpose\nFamily, twin, and adoption studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors influence the\ndevelopment of antisocial personality disorder, as well as general antisocial behavior (criminality,\nviolence, aggressiveness) (Baker, Bezdjian, & Raine, 2006). Personality and temperament dimensions\nthat are related to this disorder, including fearlessness, impulsive antisociality, and callousness, have\na substantial genetic influence (Livesley & Jang, 2008). Adoption studies clearly demonstrate that the\ndevelopment of antisocial behavior is determined by the interaction of genetic factors and adverse\nenvironmental circumstances (Rhee & Waldman, 2002). For example, one investigation found that\nadopteesofbiologicalparentswithantisocialpersonalitydisorderweremorelikelytoexhibitadolescent\nandadultantisocialbehaviorsiftheywereraisedinadverseadoptivefamilyenvironments(e.g.,adoptive\nparentshadmaritalproblems,weredivorced,useddrugs,andhadlegalproblems)thaniftheywereraised\nin a more normal adoptive environment (Cadoret, Yates, Ed, Woodworth, & Stewart, 1995).\nResearchers who are interested in the importance of environment in the development of antisocial\npersonality disorder have directed their attention to such factors as the community, the structure and\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 583\nfunctioning of the family, and peer groups. Each of these factors influences the likelihood of antisocial\nbehavior. One longitudinal investigation of more than 800 Seattle-area youth measured risk factors for\nviolence at 10, 14, 16, and 18 years of age (Herrenkohl et al., 2000). The risk factors examined included\nthoseinvolvingthefamily,peers,andcommunity.Aportionofthefindingsfromthisstudyareprovided\ninFigure 15.19.\nFigure 15.19 Longitudinal studies have helped to identify risk factors for predicting violent behavior.\nThose with antisocial tendencies do not seem to experience emotions the way most other people do.\nThese individuals fail to show fear in response to environment cues that signal punishment, pain, or\nnoxiousstimulation.Forinstance,theyshowlessskinconductance(sweatinessonhands)inanticipation\nofelectricshockthandopeoplewithoutantisocialtendencies(Hare,1965).Skinconductanceiscontrolled\nby the sympathetic nervous system and is used to assess autonomic nervous system functioning.

However, there are a group of conditions that, when\npresent, are diagnosed early in childhood, often before the time a child enters school. These conditions\nare listed in the DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders, and they involve developmental problems in\npersonal, social, academic, and intellectual functioning (APA, 2013). In this section, we will discuss two\nsuch disorders: attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and autism.\nATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER\nDiegoisalwaysactive,fromthetimehewakesupinthemorninguntilthetimehegoestobedatnight.His\nmotherreportsthathecameoutthewombkickingandscreaming,andhehasnotstoppedmovingsince.\nHehasasweetdisposition,butalwaysseemstobeintroublewithhisteachers,parents,andafter-school\nprogramcounselors.Heseemstoaccidentlybreakthings;helosthisjacketthreetimeslastwinter,andhe\nneverseemstositstill.Histeachersbelieveheisasmartchild,butheneverfinishesanythinghestartsand\nis so impulsive that he does not seem to learn much in school.\nDiego likely has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The symptoms of this disorder were\nfirst described by Hans Hoffman in the 1920s. While taking care of his son while his wife was in the\nhospital giving birth to a second child, Hoffman noticed that the boy had trouble concentrating on his\nhomework,hadashortattentionspan,andhadtorepeatedlygoovereasyhomeworktolearnthematerial\n(Jellinek&Herzog,1999).Later,itwasdiscoveredthatmanyhyperactivechildren\u2014thosewhoarefidgety,\nrestless, socially disruptive, and have trouble with impulse control\u2014also display short attention spans,\nproblems with concentration, and distractibility. By the 1970s, it had become clear that many children\nwho display attention problems often also exhibit signs of hyperactivity. In recognition of such findings,\nthe DSM-III (published in 1980) included a new disorder: attention deficit disorder with and without\nhyperactivity, now known as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAchildwithADHD shows aconstant patternofinattentionand/orhyperactiveandimpulsive behavior\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 585\nthat interferes with normal functioning (APA, 2013). Some of the signs of inattention include great\ndifficultywithandavoidanceoftasksthatrequiresustainedattention(suchasconversationsorreading),\nfailure to follow instructions (often resulting in failure to complete school work and other duties),\ndisorganization (difficulty keeping things in order, poor time management, sloppy and messy work),\nlackofattentiontodetail,becomingeasilydistracted,andforgetfulness.Hyperactivityischaracterizedby\nexcessivemovement,andincludesfidgetingorsquirming,leavingone\u2019sseatinsituationswhenremaining\nseated is expected, having trouble sitting still (e.g., in a restaurant), running about and climbing on\nthings,blurtingoutresponsesbeforeanotherperson\u2019squestionorstatementhasbeencompleted,difficulty\nwaiting one\u2019s turn for something, and interrupting and intruding on others. Frequently, the hyperactive\nchild comes across as noisy and boisterous.

This\nstudy also found that the median concordance rate for unrelated (adoptive) siblings was .09; although\nthis number is small, it is greater than 0, thus suggesting that the environment may have at least some\ninfluence.Anotherreviewofstudiesconcludedthattheheritabilityofinattentionandhyperactivitywere\n71% and 73%, respectively (Nikolas & Burt, 2010).\nThe specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the\nregulationoftheneurotransmitterdopamine(Gizer,Ficks,&Waldman,2009),suggestingthatdopamine\nmay be important in ADHD. Indeed, medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as\nmethylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant\nqualities and elevate dopamine activity. People with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions\nofthebrain,especiallythoseassociatedwithmotivationandreward(Volkowetal.,2009),whichprovides\nsupport to the theory that dopamine deficits may be a vital factor in the development this disorder\n(Swanson et al., 2007).\nBrainimagingstudieshaveshownthatchildrenwithADHDexhibitabnormalitiesintheirfrontallobes,an\nareainwhichdopamineisinabundance.ComparedtochildrenwithoutADHD,thosewithADHDappear\nto have smaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when performing mental\ntasks.Recallthatoneofthefunctionsofthefrontallobesistoinhibitourbehavior.Thus,abnormalitiesin\nthis region may go a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.\nBy the 1970s, many had become aware of the connection between nutritional factors and childhood\nbehavior. At the time, much of the public believed that hyperactivity was caused by sugar and food\nadditives, such as artificial coloring and flavoring. Undoubtedly, part of the appeal of this hypothesis\nwas that it provided a simple explanation of (and treatment for) behavioral problems in children. A\nstatistical review of 16 studies, however, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on\nthe behavioral and cognitive performance of children (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Additionally,\nalthough food additives have been shown to increase hyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the effect is\nrather small (McCann et al., 2007). Numerous studies, however, have shown a significant relationship\nbetween exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the prenatal period and ADHD (Linnet et al.,\n2003).Maternalsmokingduringpregnancyisassociatedwiththedevelopmentofmoreseveresymptoms\nof the disorder (Thakur et al., 2013).\nIs ADHD caused by poor parenting? Not likely. Remember, the genetics studies discussed above\nsuggested that the family environment does not seem to play much of a role in the development of this\ndisorder; if it did, we would expect the concordance rates to be higher for fraternal twins and adoptive\nsiblingsthanhasbeendemonstrated.Allthingsconsidered,theevidenceseemstopointtotheconclusion\nthatADHDistriggeredmorebygeneticandneurologicalfactorsandlessbysocialorenvironmentalones.\nAUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER\nAseminalpaperpublishedin1943bypsychiatristLeoKannerdescribedanunusualneurodevelopmental\ncondition he observed in a group of children.

Children with this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in three main areas: (a)\ndeficits in social interaction, (b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or\ninterests. These disturbances appear early in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA,\n2013).Thechildwithautismspectrumdisordermightexhibitdeficitsinsocialinteractionbynotinitiating\nconversationswithotherchildrenorturningtheirheadawaywhenspokento.Thesechildrendonotmake\neye contact with others and seem to prefer playing alone rather than with others. In a certain sense, it is\nalmostasthoughtheseindividualsliveinapersonalandisolatedsocialworldothersaresimplynotprivy\nto or able to penetrate. Communication deficits can range from a complete lack of speech, to one word\nresponses (e.g., saying \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d when replying to questions or statements that require additional\nelaboration), to echoed speech (e.g., parroting what another person says, either immediately or several\nhours or even days later), to difficulty maintaining a conversation because of an inability to reciprocate\nothers\u2019 comments. These deficits can also include problems in using and understanding nonverbal cues\n(e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate normal communication.\nRepetitive patterns of behavior or interests can be exhibited a number of ways. The child might engage\ninstereotyped,repetitivemovements (rocking,head-banging,orrepeatedlydroppinganobjectandthen\npicking it up), or she might show great distress at small changes in routine or the environment. For\nexample, the child might throw a temper tantrum if an object is not in its proper place or if a regularly-\nscheduled activity is rescheduled. In some cases, the person with autism spectrum disorder might show\nhighly restricted and fixated interests that appear to be abnormal in their intensity. For instance, the\npersonmightlearnandmemorizeeverydetailaboutsomethingeventhoughdoingsoservesnoapparent\npurpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the same thing as intellectual disability, although\nthese two conditions are often comorbid. The DSM-5 specifies that the symptoms of autism spectrum\ndisorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.\nLife Problems From Autism Spectrum Disorder\nAutismspectrumdisorderisreferredtoineverydaylanguageasautism;infact,thedisorderwastermed\n\u201cautistic disorder\u201d in earlier editions of the DSM, and its diagnostic criteria were much narrower than\nthose of autism spectrum disorder. The qualifier \u201cspectrum\u201d in autism spectrum disorder is used to\nindicate that individuals with the disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in\ntheirmagnitudeandseverity: some severe,otherslesssevere.Theprevious editionoftheDSM included\na diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s disorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder;\nindividuals diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence\nandastrongvocabulary,butexhibitingimpairmentsinsocialinteractionandsocialcommunication,such\nas talking only about their special interests (Wing, Gould, & Gillberg, 2011). However, because research\nhasfailedtodemonstratethatAsperger\u2019sdisorderdiffersqualitativelyfromautisticdisorder,theDSM-5\ndoes not include it, which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer\nbe eligible for special services (\u201cAsperger\u2019s Syndrome Dropped,\u201d 2012). Some individuals with autism\nspectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and intellectual skills, can live and work\nindependentlyasadults.However,mostdonotbecausethesymptomsremainsufficienttocauseserious\nimpairment in many realms of life (APA, 2013). 588 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHere is an instructive and poignantvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sevautism)\nhighlighting severe autism.\nCurrently,estimatesindicatethatnearly1in88childrenintheUnitedStateshasautismspectrumdisorder;\nthe disorder is 5 times more common in boys (1 out of 54) than girls (1 out of 252) (CDC, 2012). Rates of\nautistic spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example, California saw an\nincreaseof273%inreportedcasesfrom1987through1998(Byrd,2002);between2000and2008,therateof\nautismdiagnosesintheUnitedStatesincreased78%(CDC,2012).Althoughitisdifficulttointerpretthis\nincrease,itispossiblethattheriseinprevalenceistheresultofthebroadeningofthediagnosis,increased\nefforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In\naddition, mentalhealthprofessionals arenow more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and\nare better equipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).\nDIG DEEPER\nWhy Is the Prevalence Rate of ADHD Increasing?\nMany people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to\nsupport this contention. In a recent study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD\namong children (4\u201317 years old) in the United States increased by 22% during a 4-year period, from 7.8%\nin 2003 to 9.5% in 2007 (CDC, 2010). Over time this increase in parent-reported ADHD was observed in all\nsociodemographic groups and was reflected by substantial increases in 12 states (Indiana, North Carolina,\nandColoradowerethetopthree).Theincreasesweregreatestforolderteens(ages15\u201317),multiracialand\nHispanic children, and children with a primary language other than English. Another investigation found that\nfrom1998\u20132000through2007\u20132009theparent-reportedprevalenceofADHDincreasedamongU.S.children\nbetween the ages of 5\u201317 years old, from 6.9% to 9.0% (Akinbami, Liu, Pastor, & Reuben, 2011).\nA major weakness of both studies was that children were not actually given a formal diagnosis. Instead,\nparentsweresimplyaskedwhetherornotadoctororotherhealth-careproviderhadevertoldthemtheirchild\nhadADHD;thereportedprevalenceratesthusmayhavebeenaffectedbytheaccuracyofparentalmemory.\nNevertheless, the findings from these studies raise important questions concerning what appears to be a\ndemonstrableriseintheprevalenceofADHD.Althoughthereasonsunderlyingthisapparentincreaseinthe\nrates of ADHD over time are poorly understood and, at best, speculative, several explanations are viable:\n\u2022 ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate children as a behavior\ntreatment.\n\u2022 ThereisgreaterawarenessofADHDnowthaninthepast.NearlyeveryonehasheardofADHD,and\nmost parents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their\nchildren to a doctor if they believe their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more\nlikely now than in the past to notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation.\n\u2022 The use of computers, video games, iPhones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive\namong children in the early 21st century, and these devices could potentially shorten children\u2019s\nattentions spans. Thus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply\nreflect exposure to too much technology.\n\u2022 ADHD diagnostic criteria have changed over time.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 589\nCauses of Autism Spectrum Disorder\nEarlytheoriesofautismplacedtheblamesquarelyontheshouldersofthechild\u2019sparents,particularlythe\nmother.BrunoBettelheim(anAustrian-bornAmericanchildpsychologistwhowasheavilyinfluencedby\nSigmundFreud\u2019sideas)suggestedthatamother\u2019sambivalentattitudesandherfrozenandrigidemotions\ntoward her child were the main causal factors in childhood autism.

Autism appears to be strongly\ninfluencedbygenetics,asidenticaltwinsshowconcordanceratesof60%\u201390%,whereasconcordancerates\nfor fraternal twins and siblings are 5%\u201310% (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007). Many different\ngenesandgenemutationshavebeenimplicatedinautism(Meeketal.,2013).Amongthegenesinvolved\nare those important in the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different\nareas of the brain (Gauthier et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be\nassociated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to\nnewmutations.Thesefactorsincludeexposuretopollutants,suchasplantemissionsandmercury,urban\nversus rural residence, and vitamin D deficiency (Kinney, Barch, Chayka, Napoleon, & Munir, 2009).\nChild Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder\nIn the late 1990s, a prestigious medical journal published an article purportedly showing that autism is\ntriggeredbytheMMR(measles,mumps,andrubella)vaccine.Thesefindingswereverycontroversialand\ndrewagreatdealofattention,sparkinganinternationalforumonwhetherchildrenshouldbevaccinated.\nInashockingturnofevents,someyearslaterthearticlewasretractedbythejournalthathadpublishedit\nafteraccusationsoffraudonthepartoftheleadresearcher.Despitetheretraction,thereportinginpopular\nmedia led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting. A recent survey\nof parents, for example, found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern (Kennedy,\nLaVail, Nowak, Basket, & Landry, 2011); and perhaps fearing that their children would develop autism,\nmore than 10% of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations (Dempsey et al., 2011). Some\nparents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine-autism\nlink.Evenpoliticiansandseveralwell-knowncelebritiesweighedin;forexample,actressJennyMcCarthy\n(who believed that a vaccination caused her son\u2019s autism) co-authored a book on the matter. However,\nthereisnoscientificevidencethatalinkexistsbetweenautismandvaccinations(Hughes,2007).Indeed,a\nrecentstudycomparedthevaccinationhistoriesof256childrenwithautismspectrumdisorderwiththatof\n752controlchildrenacrossthreetimeperiodsduringtheirfirsttwoyearsoflife(birthto3months,birthto\n7months,andbirthto2years)(DeStefano,Price,&Weintraub,2013).Atthetimeofthestudy,thechildren\nwere between 6 and 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained.

Since the proliferation of the\nInternet in the 1990s, parents have been constantly bombarded with online information that can become\nmagnified and take on a life of its own. The enormous volume of electronic information pertaining to\nautism spectrum disorder, combined with how difficult it can be to grasp complex scientific concepts,\ncan make separating good research from bad challenging (Downs, 2008). Notably, the study that fueled\nthe controversy reported that 8 out of 12 children\u2014according to their parents\u2014developed symptoms\nconsistentwithautismspectrumdisordershortlyafterreceivingavaccination.Toconcludethatvaccines\ncauseautismspectrumdisorderonthisbasis,asmanydid,isclearlyincorrectforanumberofreasons,not\nthe least of which is because correlation does not imply causation, as you\u2019ve learned.\nAdditionally,aswasthecasewithdietandADHDinthe1970s,thenotionthatautismspectrumdisorder\niscausedbyvaccinationsisappealingtosomebecauseitprovidesasimpleexplanationforthiscondition.\nLike all disorders, however, there are no simple explanations for autism spectrum disorder.

Over time, the number of diagnosable conditions listed in the DSM has grown steadily,\nprompting criticism from some. Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria in the DSM are more explicit than\nthat of any other system, which makes the DSM system highly desirable for both clinical diagnosis and\nresearch.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders 595\n15.3Perspectives on Psychological Disorders\nPsychopathology is very complex, involving a plethora of etiological theories and perspectives. For\ncenturies,psychologicaldisorderswereviewedprimarilyfromasupernaturalperspectiveandthoughtto\narisefromdivineforcesorpossessionfromspirits.Someculturescontinuetoholdthissupernaturalbelief.\nToday, many who study psychopathology view mental illness from a biological perspective, whereby\npsychological disorders are thought to result largely from faulty biological processes. Indeed, scientific\nadvancesoverthelastseveraldecadeshaveprovidedabetterunderstandingofthegenetic,neurological,\nhormonal, and biochemical bases of psychopathology. The psychological perspective, in contrast,\nemphasizestheimportanceofpsychological factors(e.g.,stressandthoughts)andenvironmentalfactors\ninthedevelopmentofpsychologicaldisorders.Acontemporary,promisingapproachistoviewdisorders\nas originating from an integration of biological and psychosocial factors. The diathesis-stress model\nsuggeststhatpeoplewithanunderlyingdiathesis,orvulnerability,forapsychologicaldisorderaremore\nlikely than those without the diathesis to develop the disorder when faced with stressful events.\n15.4Anxiety Disorders\nAnxiety disorders are a group of disorders in which a person experiences excessive, persistent, and\ndistressing fear and anxiety that interferes with normal functioning. Anxiety disorders include specific\nphobia:aspecificunrealisticfear;socialanxietydisorder:extremefearandavoidanceofsocialsituations;\npanicdisorder:suddenlyoverwhelmedbypaniceventhoughthereisnoapparentreasontobefrightened;\nagoraphobia: an intense fear and avoidance of situations in which it might be difficult to escape; and\ngeneralized anxiety disorder: a relatively continuous state of tension, apprehension, and dread.\n15.5Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nObsessive-compulsiveandrelateddisordersareagroupofDSM-5disordersthatoverlapsomewhatinthat\nthey each involve intrusive thoughts and/or repetitive behaviors.

Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by the individual becoming excessively\npreoccupied with one or more perceived flaws in his physical appearance that are either nonexistent or\nunnoticeabletoothers.Preoccupationwiththeperceivedphysicaldefectscausesthepersontoexperience\nsignificant anxiety regarding how he appears to others. Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent\ndifficulty in discarding or parting with objects, regardless of their actual value, often resulting in the\naccumulation of items that clutter and congest her living area.\n15.6Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was described through much of the 20th century and was referred\nto as shell shock and combat neurosis in the belief that its symptoms were thought to emerge from the\nstress of active combat. Today, PTSD is defined as a disorder in which the experience of a traumatic or\nprofoundly stressful event, such as combat, sexual assault, or natural disaster, produces a constellation\nof symptoms that must last for one month or more. These symptoms include intrusive and distressing\nmemories of the event, flashbacks, avoidance of stimuli or situations that are connected to the event,\npersistently negative emotional states, feeling detached from others, irritability, proneness toward\noutbursts, and a tendency to be easily startled. Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will\ndevelop PTSD; a variety of risk factors associated with its development have been identified.\n15.7Mood Disorders\nMood disorders are those in which the person experiences severe disturbances in mood and emotion.\nTheyincludedepressivedisordersandbipolarandrelateddisorders.Depressivedisordersincludemajor\ndepressive disorder, which is characterized by episodes of profound sadness and loss of interest or\npleasure in usual activities and other associated features, and persistent depressive disorder, which\nmarked by a chronic state of sadness. Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood states that vacillate\nbetween sadness and euphoria; a diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires experiencing at least one manic\nepisode, which is defined as a period of extreme euphoria, irritability, and increased activity. Mood 596 Chapter 15 | Psychological Disorders\ndisorders appear to have a genetic component, with genetic factors playing a more prominent role\nin bipolar disorder than in depression. Both biological and psychological factors are important in the\ndevelopment of depression. People who suffer from mental health problems, especially mood disorders,\nare at heightened risk for suicide.\n15.8Schizophrenia\nSchizophrenia is a severe disorder characterized by a complete breakdown in one\u2019s ability to function in\nlife; it often requires hospitalization. People with schizophrenia experience hallucinations and delusions,\nand they have extreme difficulty regulating their emotions and behavior. Thinking is incoherent and\ndisorganized,behaviorisextremelybizarre,emotionsareflat,andmotivationtoengageinmostbasiclife\nactivitiesislacking.Considerableevidenceshowsthatgeneticfactorsplayacentralroleinschizophrenia;\nhowever, adoption studies have highlighted the additional importance of environmental factors.\nNeurotransmitterandbrainabnormalities,whichmaybelinkedtoenvironmentalfactorssuchasobstetric\ncomplications or exposure to influenza during the gestational period, have also been implicated. A\npromising new area of schizophrenia research involves identifying individuals who show prodromal\nsymptoms and following them over time to determine which factors best predict the development of\nschizophrenia. Future research may enable us to pinpoint those especially at risk for developing\nschizophrenia and who may benefit from early intervention.\n15.9Dissociative Disorders\nThe main characteristic of dissociative disorders is that people become dissociated from their sense of\nself, resulting in memory and identity disturbances. Dissociative disorders listed in the DSM-5 include\ndissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. A\npersonwithdissociativeamnesiaisunabletorecallimportantpersonalinformation,oftenafterastressful\nor traumatic experience.\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization\n(i.e., detachment from or unfamiliarity with the self) and/or derealization (i.e., detachment from or\nunfamiliarity with the world). A person with dissociative identity disorder exhibits two or more well-\ndefinedanddistinctpersonalitiesoridentities,aswellasmemorygapsforthetimeduringwhichanother\nidentity was present.\nDissociative identity disorder has generated controversy, mainly because some believe its symptoms\ncan be faked by patients if presenting its symptoms somehow benefits the patient in avoiding negative\nconsequencesortakingresponsibilityforone\u2019sactions.Thediagnosticratesofthisdisorderhaveincreased\ndramaticallyfollowingitsportrayalinpopularculture.However,manypeoplelegitimatelysufferoverthe\ncourse of a lifetime with this disorder.\n15.10Personality Disorders\nIndividuals with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that is inflexible, causes distress and\nimpairment, and creates problems for themselves and others. The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality\ndisorders, organized into three clusters. The disorders in Cluster A include those characterized by a\npersonality style that is odd and eccentric. Cluster B includes personality disorders characterized chiefly\nby a personality style that is impulsive, dramatic, highly emotional, and erratic, and those in Cluster\nC are characterized by a nervous and fearful personality style. Two Cluster B personality disorders,\nborderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, are especially problematic.

According to\ntheU.S.DepartmentofHealthandHumanServices(2013),19%ofU.S.adultsexperiencedmentalillness\nin 2012. For teens (ages 13\u201318), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8\u201315, current\nestimatessuggestthat13%experiencementalillnessinagivenyear(NationalInstituteofMentalHealth\n[NIMH], n.d.-a)\nWithmanydifferenttreatmentoptionsavailable,approximatelyhowmanypeoplereceivementalhealth\ntreatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n(SAMHSA), in 2008, 13.4% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, n.d.-b). These\npercentages, shown in Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and\noutpatient settings and/or used prescription medication for psychological disorders.\nFigure 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004\u20132008 is shown. Adults seeking\ntreatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.\nChildren and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately\nhalf (50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past\nyear (NIMH, n.d.-c). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of\ndisorder (Figure 16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received\ntreatment in the past year, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive\ntreatment. Can you think of some possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment 603\nFigure 16.3 About one-third to one-half of U.S. adolescents (ages 8\u201315) with mental disorders receive treatment,\nwith behavior-related disorders more likely to be treated.\nConsideringthemanyformsoftreatmentformentalhealthdisordersavailabletoday,howdidtheseforms\noftreatmentemerge?Let\u2019stakealookatthehistoryofmentalhealthtreatmentfromthepast(withsome\nquestionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.\nTREATMENT IN THE PAST\nFor much of history, the mentally ill have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mental illness\nwas caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medieval\ntimes,abnormalbehaviorswereviewedasasignthatapersonwaspossessedbydemons.Ifsomeonewas\nconsidered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual.\nThe most common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures:\nIncantationsandprayersweresaidovertheperson\u2019sbody,andshemayhavebeengivensomemedicinal\ndrinks. Another form of treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was\nmadeintheafflictedindividual\u2019sskulltoreleasespiritsfromthebody.Mostpeopletreatedinthismanner\ndied. In addition to exorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of\npeople with psychological disorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking,\nmost people who exhibited strange behaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The\nprevailing theory of psychopathology in earlier history was the idea that mental illness was the result of\ndemonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evil god because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all\nunexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good or evil.\nFrom the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was\nthatsomepeoplemadepactswiththedevilandcommittedhorribleacts,suchaseatingbabies(Blumberg,\n2007).Thesepeoplewereconsidered tobewitchesandweretriedandcondemned bycourts\u2014theywere\noften burned at the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were\nkilled after being accused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)\nBythe18thcentury,peoplewhowereconsideredoddandunusualwereplacedinasylums(Figure16.4).\nAsylumswerethefirstinstitutionscreatedforthespecificpurposeofhousingpeoplewithpsychological\ndisorders,butthefocuswasostracizingthemfromsocietyratherthantreatingtheirdisorders.Oftenthese\npeoplewerekeptinwindowlessdungeons,beaten,chainedtotheirbeds,andhadlittletonocontactwith\ncaregivers. 604 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment\nFigure 16.4 This painting by Francisco Goya, calledThe Madhouse, depicts a mental asylum and its inhabitants in\nthe early 1800s.

She investigated how those who are mentally ill and poor were cared for, and she discovered an\nunderfundedandunregulatedsystemthatperpetuatedabuseofthispopulation(Tiffany,1891).Horrified\nbyherfindings, Dix beganlobbying various state legislatures and theU.S. Congress for change (Tiffany,\n1891). Her efforts led to the creation of the first mental asylums in the United States.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment 605\nFigure 16.6 Dorothea Dix was a social reformer who became an advocate for the indigent insane and was\ninstrumental in creating the first American mental asylum. She did this by relentlessly lobbying state legislatures and\nCongress to set up and fund such institutions.\nDespite reformers\u2019 efforts, however, a typical asylum was filthy, offered very little treatment, and often\nkept people for decades. At Willard Psychiatric Center in upstate New York, for example, one treatment\nwas to submerge patients in cold baths for long periods of time. Electroshock treatment was also used,\nand the way the treatment was administered often broke patients\u2019 backs; in 1943, doctors at Willard\nadministered 1,443 shock treatments (Willard Psychiatric Center, 2009). (Electroshock is now called\nelectroconvulsive treatment, and the therapy is still used, but with safeguards and under anesthesia.

These\nproved a tremendous help in controlling the symptoms of certain psychological disorders, such as\npsychosis. Psychosis was a common diagnosis of individuals in mental hospitals, and it was often\nevidenced by symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, indicating a loss of contact with reality. Then\nin 1963, Congress passed and John F. Kennedy signed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community\nMental Health Centers Construction Act, which provided federal support and funding for community\nmental health centers (National Institutes of Health, 2013). This legislation changed how mental health\nservicesweredeliveredintheUnitedStates.Itstartedtheprocessofdeinstitutionalization,theclosingof\nlargeasylums,byprovidingforpeopletostayintheircommunitiesandbetreatedlocally.In1955,there\nwere558,239severelymentallyillpatientsinstitutionalizedatpublichospitals(Torrey,1997).By1994,by\npercentage of the population, there were 92% fewer hospitalized individuals (Torrey, 1997).\nMENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TODAY\nToday, there are community mental health centers across the nation. They are located in neighborhoods\nnearthehomesofclients,andtheyprovidelargenumbersofpeoplewithmentalhealthservicesofvarious\nkinds and for many kinds of problems. Unfortunately, part of what occurred with deinstitutionalization\nwas that those released from institutions were supposed to go to newly created centers, but the system\nwasnotsetupeffectively.Centerswereunderfunded,staffwasnottrainedtohandlesevereillnessessuch\nas schizophrenia, there was high staff burnout, and no provision was made for the other services people\nneeded, such as housing, food, and job training. Without these supports, those people released under\ndeinstitutionalizationoftenendeduphomeless.Eventoday,alargeportionofthehomelesspopulationis\nconsidered to be mentally ill (Figure 16.7). Statistics show that 26% of homeless adults living in shelters\nexperience mental illness (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], 2011). 606 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment\nFigure 16.7 (a) Of the homeless individuals in U.S. shelters, about one-quarter have a severe mental illness (HUD,\n2011). (b) Correctional institutions also report a high number of individuals living with mental illness. (credit a:\nmodification of work by C.G.P. Grey; credit b: modification of work by Bart Everson)\nAnother group of the mentally ill population is involved in the corrections system. According to a\n2006 special report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), approximately 705,600 mentally ill adults\nwere incarcerated in the state prison system, and another 78,800 were incarcerated in the federal prison\nsystem. A further 479,000 were in local jails. According to the study, \u201cpeople with mental illnesses are\noverrepresented in probation and parole populations at estimated rates ranging from two to four times\nthe general population\u201d (Prins & Draper, 2009, p. 23). The Treatment Advocacy Center reported that the\ngrowing number of mentally ill inmates has placed a burden on the correctional system (Torrey et al.,\n2014).\nToday,insteadofasylums,therearepsychiatrichospitalsrunbystategovernmentsandlocalcommunity\nhospitalsfocusedonshort-termcare.Inalltypesofhospitals,theemphasisisonshort-termstays,withthe\naveragelengthofstaybeinglessthantwoweeksandoftenonlyseveraldays.Thisispartlyduetothevery\nhighcostofpsychiatrichospitalization,whichcanbeabout$800to$1000pernight(Stensland,Watson,&\nGrazier,2012).Therefore,insurancecoverage oftenlimitsthelengthoftimeapersoncanbehospitalized\nfor treatment.

An incarcerated person might receive group therapy in\nprison.Therearemanydifferenttypesoftreatmentproviders,andlicensingrequirementsvaryfromstate\nto state. Besides psychologists and psychiatrists, there are clinical social workers, marriage and family\ntherapists, and trained religious personnel who also perform counseling and therapy.\nA range of funding sources pay for mental health treatment: health insurance, government, and private\npay. In the past, even when people had health insurance, the coverage would not always pay for mental\nhealth services. This changed with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which\nrequires group health plans and insurers to make sure there is parity of mental health services (U.S.\nDepartment of Labor, n.d.). This means that co-pays, total number of visits, and deductibles for mental\nhealthand substance abuse treatment needto beequalto andcannot bemore restrictive or harsher than\nthose for physical illnesses and medical/surgical problems.\nFinding treatment sources is also not always easy: theremay belimited options, especially inruralareas\nandlow-incomeurbanareas;waitinglists;poorqualityofcareavailableforindigentpatients;andfinancial\nobstaclessuchasco-pays,deductibles,andtimeofffromwork.Over85%ofthel,669federallydesignated\nmental health professional shortage areas are rural; often primary care physicians and law enforcement\narethefirst-linementalhealthproviders(Ivey,Scheffler,&Zazzali,1998),althoughtheydonothavethe\nspecializedtrainingofamentalhealthprofessional,whooftenwouldbebetterequippedtoprovidecare.\nAvailability,accessibility,andacceptability(thestigmaattachedtomentalillness)areallproblemsinrural\nareas.Approximatelytwo-thirdsofthosewithsymptomsreceivenocareatall(U.S.DepartmentofHealth\nandHumanServices,2005;Wagenfeld,Murray,Mohatt,&DeBruiynb,1994).Attheendof2013,theU.S.\nDepartmentofAgricultureannouncedaninvestmentof$50milliontohelpimproveaccessandtreatment\nfor mental health problems as part of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to strengthen rural communities. 608 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment\n16.2 Types of Treatment\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Distinguish between psychotherapy and biomedical therapy\n\u2022 Recognize various orientations to psychotherapy\n\u2022 Discuss psychotropic medications and recognize which medications are used to treat\nspecific psychological disorders\nOne of the goals of therapy is to help a person stop repeating and reenacting destructive patterns and to\nstart looking for better solutions to difficult situations.

It was\nthe dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century, but it has since waned significantly in\npopularity. Freud believed most of our psychological problems are the result of repressed impulses\nand trauma experienced in childhood, and he believed psychoanalysis would help uncover long-buried\nfeelings. In a psychoanalyst\u2019s office, you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or\nchildhoodmemories,andthetherapistusingvariousFreudianmethodssuchasfreeassociationanddream\nanalysis(Figure16.9).Infreeassociation,thepatientrelaxesandthensayswhatevercomestomindatthe\nmoment. However, Freud felt that the ego would at times try to block, or repress, unacceptable urges or\npainfulconflictsduringfreeassociation.Consequently,apatientwoulddemonstrateresistancetorecalling\nthese thoughts or situations. Indream analysis, a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams.\nPsychoanalysis is a therapy approach that typically takes years. Over the course of time, the patient\nreveals a great deal about himself to the therapist. Freud suggested that during this patient-therapist\nrelationship, the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist\u2014maybe positive feelings,\nmaybe negative feelings. Freud called this transference: the patient transfers all the positive or negative\nemotions associated with the patient\u2019s other relationships to the psychoanalyst. For example, Crystal is\nseeingapsychoanalyst.Duringtheyearsoftherapy,shecomestoseehertherapistasafatherfigure.She\ntransfersherfeelingsaboutherfatherontohertherapist,perhapsinanefforttogaintheloveandattention\nshe did not receive from her own father. 610 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment\nFigure 16.9 This is the famous couch in Freud\u2019s consulting room. Patients were instructed to lie comfortably on the\ncouch and to face away from Freud in order to feel less inhibited and to help them focus. Today, a psychotherapy\npatient is not likely to lie on a couch; instead he is more likely to sit facing the therapist (Prochaska & Norcross,\n2010).

This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to \u201chelp clients\nprevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth\u201d (O\u2019Connor, 2000, p. 7). The\nidea is that children play out their hopes, fantasies, and traumas while using dolls, stuffed animals, and\nsandboxfigurines(Figure16.10).Playtherapycanalsobeusedtohelpatherapistmakeadiagnosis.The\ntherapist observes how the child interacts with toys (e.g., dolls, animals, and home settings) in an effort\nto understand the roots of the child\u2019s disturbed behavior. Play therapy can be nondirective or directive.\nIn nondirective play therapy, children are encouraged to work through their problems by playing freely\nwhile the therapist observes (LeBlanc & Ritchie, 2001). In directive play therapy, the therapist provides\nmorestructureandguidanceintheplaysessionbysuggestingtopics,askingquestions,andevenplaying\nwith the child (Harter, 1977).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment 611\nFigure 16.10 This type of play therapy is known as sandplay or sandtray therapy.

In\nbehavior therapy, a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable\nbehaviors\u2014rather than digging deeply into one\u2019s unconscious. Therapists with this orientation believe\nthatdysfunctionalbehaviors,likephobiasandbedwetting,canbechangedbyteachingclientsnew,more\nconstructive behaviors. Behavior therapy employs both classical and operant conditioning techniques to\nchange behavior.\nOnetypeofbehaviortherapyutilizesclassicalconditioningtechniques.Therapistsusingthesetechniques\nbelieve that dysfunctional behaviors are conditioned responses.

She\u2019s been invited to several sleepovers,\nbut she won\u2019t go because of her problem. Using a type of conditioning therapy, Emmie begins to sleep\non a liquid-sensitive bed pad that is hooked to an alarm. When moisture touches the pad, it sets off the\nalarm, waking up Emmie. When this process is repeated enough times, Emmie develops an association\nbetween urinary relaxation and waking up, and this stops the bedwetting. Emmie has now gone three\nweeks without wetting her bed and is looking forward to her first sleepover this weekend.\nOnecommonlyusedclassicalconditioningtherapeutictechniqueiscounterconditioning:aclientlearnsa\nnewresponsetoastimulusthathaspreviouslyelicitedanundesirablebehavior.Twocounterconditioning\ntechniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy. Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant\nstimulustostopanundesirablebehavior.Therapistsapplythistechniquetoeliminateaddictivebehaviors,\nsuch as smoking, nailbiting, and drinking. In aversion therapy,clients will typically engageinaspecific\nbehavior (such as nail biting) and at the same time are exposed to something unpleasant, such as a\nmild electric shock or a bad taste. After repeated associations between the unpleasant stimulus and the\nbehavior, the client can learn to stop the unwanted behavior.\nAversion therapy has been used effectively for years in the treatment of alcoholism (Davidson, 1974;\nElkins, 1991; Streeton & Whelan, 2001). One common way this occurs is through a chemically based\nsubstanceknownasAntabuse.WhenapersontakesAntabuseandthenconsumesalcohol,uncomfortable\nside effects result including nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, heart palpitations, severe headache,\nand shortness of breath. Antabuse is repeatedly paired with alcohol until the client associates alcohol\nwith unpleasant feelings, which decreases the client\u2019s desire to consume alcohol. Antabuse creates a\nconditioned aversion to alcohol because it replaces the original pleasure response with an unpleasant one.\nInexposuretherapy,atherapistseekstotreatclients\u2019fearsoranxietybypresentingthemwiththeobject\nor situation that causes their problem, with the idea that they will eventually get used to it.

She teaches Jayden how to relax each of his muscle groups so that\nhe achieves a drowsy, relaxed, and comfortable state of mind. Once he\u2019s in this state, she asks Jayden to\nimagine a mildly anxiety-provoking situation. Jayden is standing in front of the elevator thinking about\npressing the call button.\nIf this scenario causes Jayden anxiety, he lifts his finger.

After this, Jayden and the therapist begin to practice what he only previously\nenvisioned in therapy, gradually going from pressing the button to actually riding an elevator. The goal\nis that Jayden will soon be able to take the elevator all the way up to the 29th floor of his office without\nfeeling any anxiety.\nSometimes, it\u2019s too impractical, expensive, or embarrassing to re-create anxiety- producing situations, so\na therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears.\nVirtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as\nthefearofpublicspeaking,claustrophobia(fearofenclosedspaces),aviophobia(fearofflying),andpost-\ntraumaticstressdisorder(PTSD),atraumaandstressor-relateddisorder(Gerardi,Cukor,Difede,Rizzo,&\nRothbaum, 2010).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA new virtual reality exposure therapy is being used to treat PTSD in soldiers. Virtual\nIraq is a simulation that mimics Middle Eastern cities and desert roads with situations\nsimilar to those soldiers experienced while deployed in Iraq. This method of virtual\nreality exposure therapy has been effective in treating PTSD for combat veterans.\nApproximately 80% of participants who completed treatment saw clinically significant\nreduction in their symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression (Rizzo et al., 2010). Watch thisVirtual Iraq\nvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/virIraq)showing soldiers being treated via simulation. 614 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment\nSome behavior therapies employ operant conditioning.

Patients are rewarded with tokens when they engage in positive\nbehaviors (e.g., making their beds, brushing their teeth, coming to the cafeteria on time, and socializing\nwith other patients). They can later exchange the tokens for extra TV time, private rooms, visits to the\ncanteen, and so on (Dickerson, Tenhula, & Green-Paden, 2005).\nPSYCHOTHERAPY: COGNITIVE THERAPY\nCognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person\u2019s thoughts lead to feelings\nof distress. The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and\nact. Cognitive therapists help their clients change dysfunctional thoughts in order to relieve distress.\nThey help a client see how they misinterpret a situation (cognitive distortion). For example, a client\nmay overgeneralize. Because Ray failed one test in his Psychology 101 course, he feels he is stupid and\nworthless. These thoughts then cause his mood to worsen. Therapists also help clients recognize when\ntheyblowthingsoutofproportion.BecauseRayfailedhisPsychology101test,hehasconcludedthathe\u2019s\ngoingtofailtheentirecourseandprobablyflunkoutofcollegealtogether.Theseerrorsinthinkinghave\ncontributedtoRay\u2019sfeelingsofdistress.Histherapistwillhelphimchallengetheseirrationalbeliefs,focus\non their illogical basis, and correct them with more logical and rational thoughts and beliefs.\nCognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s. His initial focus was on\ndepression and how a client\u2019s self-defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive\nfactors in her life (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) (Figure 16.13). Through questioning, a cognitive\ntherapist can help a client recognize dysfunctional ideas, challenge catastrophizing thoughts about\nthemselves and their situations, and find a more positive way to view things (Beck, 2011).\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment 615\nFigure 16.13 Your emotional reactions are the result of your thoughts about the situation rather than the situation\nitself. For instance, if you consistently interpret events and emotions around the themes of loss and defeat, then you\nare likely to be depressed. Through therapy, you can learn more logical ways to interpret situations.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView a brief video in whichJudith Beck talks about cognitive therapy\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/JBeck)and conducts a session with a client.\nPSYCHOTHERAPY: COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY\nCognitive-behavioraltherapistsfocusmuchmoreonpresentissuesthanonapatient\u2019schildhoodorpast,\nas in other forms of psychotherapy. One of the first forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy was rational\nemotive therapy (RET), which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian\npsychoanalysis (Daniel, n.d.). Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis\u2019s therapeutic\napproach (National Association of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists, 2009).\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior. It\naimstochangecognitivedistortionsandself-defeatingbehaviors.Inessence,thisapproachisdesignedto\nchangethewaypeoplethinkaswellashowtheyact.ItissimilartocognitivetherapyinthatCBTattempts\nto make individuals aware of their irrational and negative thoughts and helps people replace them with\nnew, more positive ways of thinking. It is also similar to behavior therapies in that CBT teaches people\nhowtopracticeandengageinmorepositiveandhealthyapproachestodailysituations.Intotal,hundreds\nof studies have shown the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of numerous\npsychological disorders such as depression, PTSD, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, bipolar disorder,\nand substance abuse (Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, n.d.). For example, CBT has been\nfound to be effective in decreasing levels of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts in previously suicidal\nteenagers (Alavi, Sharifi, Ghanizadeh, & Dehbozorgi, 2013). Cognitive-behavioral therapy has also been\neffective in reducing PTSD in specific populations, such as transit workers (Lowinger & Rombom, 2012).\nCognitive-behavioral therapy aims to change cognitive distortions and self-defeating behaviors using\ntechniquesliketheABCmodel.Withthismodel,thereisanAction(sometimescalledanactivatingevent),\ntheBeliefabouttheevent,andtheConsequencesofthisbelief.Let\u2019ssay,JonandJoebothgotoaparty.Jon\nandJoeeachhavemetayoungwomanattheparty:JonistalkingwithMeganmostoftheparty,andJoeis\ntalkingwithAmanda.Attheendoftheparty,JonasksMeganforherphonenumberandJoeasksAmanda.\nMegan tells Jon she would rather not give him her number, and Amanda tells Joe the same thing.

Jon is internalizing the attribution or reason for the rebuffs, which triggers his depression.\nOn the other hand, Joe is externalizing the cause, so his thinking does not contribute to feelings of\ndepression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy examines specific maladaptive and automatic thoughts and\ncognitive distortions. Some examples of cognitive distortions are all-or-nothing thinking,\novergeneralization, and jumping to conclusions. In overgeneralization, someone takes a small situation\nandmakesithuge\u2014forexample,insteadofsaying,\u201cThisparticularwomanwasnotinterestedinme,\u201dthe\nman says, \u201cI am ugly, a loser, and no one is ever going to be interested in me.\u201d\nAll or nothing thinking, which is a common type of cognitive distortion for people suffering from\ndepression,reflectsextremes.Inotherwords,everythingisblackorwhite.Afterbeingturneddownfora\ndate,Jonbeginstothink,\u201cNowomanwillevergooutwithme.I\u2019mgoingtobealoneforever.\u201dHebegins\nto feel anxious and sad as he contemplates his future.\nThe third kind of distortion involves jumping to conclusions\u2014assuming that people are thinking\nnegatively about you or reacting negatively to you, even though there is no evidence.

Note the change from patients to clients. Rogers (1951) felt that the term patient suggested the\nperson seeking help was sick and looking for a cure.

Another meta-analysis found that psychodynamic therapy was also as effective\nat treating these types of psychological issues as CBT (Shedler, 2010). However, no studies have found\none psychotherapeutic approach more effective thananother (Abbass, Kisely, &Kroenke, 2006;Chorpita\net al., 2011), nor have they shown any relationship between a client\u2019s treatment outcome and the level\nof the clinician\u2019s training or experience (Wampold, 2007).

A more recent alternative is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a procedure approved by\nthe FDA in 2008 that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve depression\nsymptoms; it is used when other treatments have not worked (Mayo Clinic, 2012).\nDIG DEEPER\nEvidence-based Practice\nA buzzword in therapy today is evidence-based practice. However, it\u2019s not a novel concept but one that\nhas been used in medicine for at least two decades. Evidence-based practice is used to reduce errors in\ntreatmentselectionbymakingclinicaldecisionsbasedonresearch(Sackett&Rosenberg,1995).Inanycase, 620 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment\nevidence-based treatment is on the rise in the field of psychology. So what is it, and why does it matter? In\nan effort to determine which treatment methodologies are evidenced-based, professional organizations such\nas the American Psychological Association (APA) have recommended that specific psychological treatments\nbeusedtotreatcertainpsychologicaldisorders(Chambless&Ollendick,2001).AccordingtotheAPA(2005),\n\u201cEvidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) is the integration of the best available research with clinical\nexpertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences\u201d (p. 1).\nThe foundational idea behind evidence based treatment is that best practices are determined by research\nevidence that has been compiled by comparing various forms of treatment (Charman & Barkham, 2005).\nThese treatments are then operationalized and placed in treatment manuals\u2014trained therapists follow these\nmanuals.Thebenefitsarethatevidence-basedtreatmentcanreducevariabilitybetweentherapiststoensure\nthat a specific approach is delivered with integrity (Charman & Barkham, 2005). Therefore, clients have a\nhigherchanceofreceivingtherapeuticinterventionsthatareeffectiveattreatingtheirspecificdisorder.While\nEBPP is based on randomized control trials, critics of EBPP reject it stating that the results of trials cannot\nbe applied to individuals and instead determinations regarding treatment should be based on a therapist\u2019s\njudgment (Mullen & Streiner, 2004).\n16.3 Treatment Modalities\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Distinguish between the various modalities of treatment\n\u2022 Discuss benefits of group therapy\nOnce a person seeks treatment, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, he has an intake done to assess\nhis clinical needs. An intake is the therapist\u2019s first meeting with the client. The therapist gathers specific\ninformationtoaddresstheclient\u2019simmediateneeds,suchasthepresentingproblem,theclient\u2019ssupport\nsystem, and insurance status. The therapist informs the client about confidentiality, fees, and what to\nexpect in treatment. Confidentiality means the therapist cannot disclose confidential communications\nto any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so. During the intake, the therapist and\nclient will work together to discuss treatment goals. Then a treatment plan will be formulated, usually\nwithspecificmeasurableobjectives.Also,thetherapistandclientwilldiscusshowtreatmentsuccesswill\nbe measured and the estimated length of treatment. There are several different modalities of treatment\n(Figure 16.14): Individual therapy, family therapy, couples therapy, and group therapy are the most\ncommon.\nFigure 16.14 Therapy may occur (a) one-on-one between a therapist and client, or (b) in a group setting.

(credit: Alan\nCleaver)\nGROUP THERAPY\nIn group therapy, a clinician meets together with several clients with similar problems (Figure 16.16).\nWhen children are placed in group therapy, it is particularly important to match clients for age and\nproblems. One benefit of group therapy is that it can help decrease a client\u2019s shame and isolation about\na problem while offering needed support, both from the therapist and other members of the group\n(American Psychological Association, 2014). A nine-year-old sexual abuse victim, for example, may feel\nveryembarrassedandashamed.Ifheisplacedinagroupwithothersexuallyabusedboys,hewillrealize\nthat he is not alone. A child struggling with poor social skills would likely benefit from a group with a\nspecificcurriculumtofosterspecialskills.Awomansufferingfrompost-partumdepressioncouldfeelless\nguilty and more supported by being in a group with similar women.\nGroup therapy also has some specific limitations.

Finally, clients can practice social skills in\ngroup treatment settings. (McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, & Ellerby, 2009)\nGroups that have a strong educational component are called psycho-educational groups. For example, a\ngroup for children whose parents have cancer might discuss in depth what cancer is, types of treatment\nforcancer,andthesideeffectsoftreatments,suchashairloss.Often,grouptherapysessionswithchildren\ntakeplaceinschool.Theyareledbyaschoolcounselor,aschoolpsychologist,oraschoolsocialworker.\nGroups might focus on test anxiety, social isolation, self-esteem, bullying, or school failure (Shechtman,\n2002). Whether the group is held in school or in a clinician\u2019s office, group therapy has been found to be\neffective with children facing numerous kinds of challenges (Shechtman, 2002).\nDuringagroupsession,theentiregroupcouldreflectonanindividual\u2019sproblemordifficulties,andothers\nmight disclose what they have done in that situation. When a clinician is facilitating a group, the focus\nis always on making sure that everyone benefits and participates in the group and that no one person\nis the focus of the entire session. Groups can be organized in various ways: some have an overarching\ntheme or purpose, some are time-limited, some have open membership that allows people to come and\ngo, and some are closed. Some groups are structured with planned activities and goals, while others are\nunstructured:Thereisnospecificplan,andgroupmembersthemselvesdecidehowthegroupwillspend\nitstimeandonwhatgoalsitwillfocus.Thiscanbecomeacomplexandemotionallychargedprocess,but\nit is also an opportunity for personal growth (Page & Berkow, 1994).\nCOUPLES THERAPY\nCouplestherapyinvolvestwopeopleinanintimaterelationshipwhoarehavingdifficultiesandaretrying\nto resolve them (Figure 16.17). The couple may be dating, partnered, engaged, or married. The primary\ntherapeutic orientation used in couples counseling is cognitive-behavioral therapy (Rathus & Sanderson,\n1999). Couples meet with a therapist to discuss conflicts and/or aspects of their relationship that they\nwant to change. The therapist helps them see how their individual backgrounds, beliefs, and actions are\naffecting their relationship. Often, a therapist tries to help the couple resolve these problems, as well as\nimplement strategies that will lead to a healthier and happier relationship, such as how to listen, how to\nargue, and how to express feelings. However, sometimes, after working with a therapist, a couple will\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment 623\nrealizethattheyaretooincompatibleandwilldecidetoseparate.Somecouplesseektherapytoworkout\ntheir problems, while others attend therapy to determine whether staying together is the best solution.\nCounselingcouplesinahigh-conflictandvolatilerelationshipcanbedifficult.Infact,psychologistsPeter\nPearsonandEllynBader,whofoundedtheCouplesInstituteinPaloAlto,California,havecomparedthe\nexperienceoftheclinicianincouples\u2019therapytobelike\u201cpilotingahelicopterinahurricane\u201d(Weil,2012,\npara. 7).\nFigure 16.17 In couples counseling, a therapist helps people work on their relationship.

The goal of this approach is to\nenhance the growth of each family member as well as that of the family as a whole.\nOften,dysfunctionalpatternsofcommunicationthatdevelopbetweenfamilymemberscanleadtoconflict.\nA family with this dynamic might wish to attend therapy together rather than individually.

Specialized therapies have also\nbeen developed for specific types of substance-related disorders, including alcohol, cocaine, and opioids\n(McGovern & Carroll, 2003). Substance-related treatment is considered much more cost-effective than\nincarceration or not treating those with addictions (NIDA, 2012) (Figure 16.19).\nFigure 16.19 Substance use and abuse costs the United States over $600 billion a year (NIDA, 2012).

While in\ntreatment,anaddictmightreceivebehaviortherapy,whichcanhelpmotivatetheaddicttoparticipatein\nthe treatment program and teach strategies for dealing with cravings and how to prevent relapse.

This means that\ntreatmentwilladdressfactorssuchascommunication,stressmanagement,relationshipissues,parenting,\nvocational concerns, and legal concerns (McGovern & Carroll, 2003; NIDA, 2012).\nWhile individual therapy is used in the treatment of substance-related disorders, group therapy is the\nmostwidespreadtreatmentmodality(Weiss,Jaffee,deMenil,&Cogley,2004).Therationalebehindusing\ngrouptherapyforaddictiontreatmentisthataddictsaremuchmorelikelytomaintainsobrietyinagroup\nformat. It has been suggested that this is due to the rewarding and therapeutic benefits of the group,\nsuchassupport,affiliation,identification,andevenconfrontation(CenterforSubstanceAbuseTreatment,\n2005). For teenagers, the whole family often needs to participate in treatment to address issues such as\nfamily dynamics, communication, and relapse prevention. Family involvement in teen drug addiction is\nvital. Research suggests that greater parental involvement is correlated with a greater reduction in use\nby teen substance abusers. Also, mothers who participated in treatment displayed better mental health\nand greater warmth toward their children (Bertrand et al., 2013).

Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions, and in many\ncases, psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy. For example, evidence suggests\nthat bupropion (trade names: Wellbutrin and Zyban), approved for treating depression and nicotine\ndependence, might also help reduce craving and use of the drug methamphetamine (NIDA, 2011).\nHowever,moreresearchisneededtobetterunderstandhowthesemedicationswork\u2014particularlywhen\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col11629/1.5 Chapter 16 | Therapy and Treatment 627\ncombined in patients with comorbidities.\n16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how the sociocultural model is used in therapy\n\u2022 Discuss barriers to mental health services among ethnic minorities\nThe sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your\nculture and background.

For example, in one recent study of 462 older Korean Americans (over the age of 60)\nmany participants reported suffering from depressive symptoms. However, 71% indicated they thought\ndepressionwasasignofpersonalweakness,and14%reportedthathavingamentallyillfamilymember\nwould bring shame to the family (Jang, Chiriboga, & Okazaki, 2009).\nLanguage differences are a further barrier to treatment. In the previous study on Korean Americans\u2019\nattitudes toward mental health services, it was found that there were no Korean-speaking mental health\nprofessionals where the study was conducted (Orlando and Tampa, Florida) (Jang et al., 2009). Because\nof the growing number of people from ethnically diverse backgrounds, there is a need for therapists\nand psychologists to develop knowledge and skills to become culturally competent (Ahmed, Wilson,\nHenriksen, & Jones, 2011). Those providing therapy must approach the process from the context of the\nunique culture of each client (Sue & Sue, 2007).\nDIG DEEPER\nTreatment Perceptions\nBythetimeachildisaseniorinhighschool,20%ofhisclassmates\u2014thatis1in5\u2014willhaveexperienceda\nmentalhealthproblem(U.S.DepartmentofHealthandHumanServices,1999),and8%\u2014about1in12\u2014will\nhaveattemptedsuicide(CentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention,2014).Ofthoseclassmatesexperiencing\nmental disorders, only 20% will receive professional help (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000).

little to no treatment,\nand many of the methods used were cruel.

However, most people suffering from mental illness\narenothospitalized.Apersonsufferingsymptomscouldspeakwithaprimarycarephysician,whomost\nlikely would refer him to someone who specializes in therapy. The person can receive outpatient mental\nhealth services from a variety of sources, including psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family\ntherapists, school counselors, clinical social workers, and religious personnel. These therapy sessions\nwould be covered through insurance, government funds, or private (self) pay.\n16.2Types of Treatment\nPsychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud. Freud\u2019s theory is that a person\u2019s psychological\nproblems are the result of repressed impulses or childhood trauma. The goal of the therapist is to help a\nperson uncover buried feelings by using techniques such as free association and dream analysis.\nPlay therapy is a psychodynamic therapy technique often used with children. The idea is that children\nplay out their hopes, fantasies, and traumas, using dolls, stuffed animals, and sandbox figurines.\nInbehaviortherapy,atherapistemploysprinciplesoflearningfromclassicalandoperantconditioningto\nhelpclientschangeundesirablebehaviors.Counterconditioningisacommonlyusedtherapeutictechnique\ninwhichaclientlearnsanewresponsetoastimulusthathaspreviouslyelicitedanundesirablebehavior\nvia classical conditioning.

The best treatment would address both problems simultaneously.\n16.5The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization\nThe sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your\nculture and background. Clinicians using this approach integrate cultural and religious beliefs into the\ntherapeutic process. Research has shown that ethnic minorities are less likely to access mental health\nservices than their White middle-class American counterparts. Barriers to treatment include lack of\ninsurance, transportation, and time; cultural views that mental illness is a stigma; fears about treatment;\nand language barriers.\nReview Questions\n1.

With proactive interference, it\u2019s the\nopposite:oldinformationhinderstherecallofnewlylearnedinformation. 19.Theself-referenceeffectisthetendency\nan individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself than information that is not personally\nrelevant.Youcanusetheself-referenceeffecttorelatethematerialtosomethingyouhavealreadylearnedforanother\nclass,orthinkhowyoucanapplytheconceptstoyourlife.Whenyoudothis,youarebuildingawebofretrievalcues\nthat will help you access the material when you want to remember it.\nChapter9\n1.C 3.A 5.D 7.D 9.C 11.A 13.B 15.The nature versus nurture controversy seeks to understand whether our\npersonalities and traits are the product of our genetic makeup and biological factors, or whether they are shaped\nbyourenvironment,whichincludessuchthingsasourparents,peers,andculture.Today,psychologistsagreethat\nboth nature and nurture interact to shape who we become, but the debate over the relative contributions of each\ncontinues. An example would be a child learning to walk: Nature influences when the physical ability occurs, but\nculturecaninfluencewhenachildmastersthisskill,asinAch\u00e9culture. 17.Childrendevelopatdifferentrates.For\nexample,somechildrenmaywalkandtalkasearlyas8monthsold,whileothersmaynotdosountilwellaftertheir\nfirst birthday.

When you stroke a baby\u2019s cheek she will naturally\nturn her head that way and begin to suck. This may aid survival because it helps the newborn locate a source of\nfood. 27.Emerging adulthood is a relatively new period of lifespan development from 18 years old to the mid-20s,\ncharacterized as a transitional time in which identity exploration focuses on work and love.

On the\nother hand, some parents may be too soft when it comes to potty training. In this case, Freud said that children\ncould also become fixated and display an anal-expulsive personality. As an adult, an anal-expulsive personality is\nmessy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts. 28.Horney disagreed with the Freudian idea that\nwomenhadpenisenvyandwerejealousofaman\u2019sbiologicalfeatures.Horneydiscussedthatthejealousywasmore\nlikely culturally based, due to the greater privileges that males often have, and that differences between men and\nwomen\u2019spersonalitieswerecultural,notbiologicallybased.Horneyalsosuggestedthatmenmayhavewombenvy,\nbecause men cannot give birth. 30.Skinner disagreed with Freud\u2019s idea that childhood plays an important role in\nshaping our personality. He argued that personality develops over our entire life, rather than in the first few years\noflifeasFreudsuggested.Skinnersaidthatourresponsescanchangeaswecomeacrossnewsituations;therefore,\nwe can see more variability over time in personality. 32.The Big Five traits are relatively stable over our lifespan\nwithatendencyforthetraitstoincreaseordecreaseslightly.Researchershavefoundthatconscientiousnessincreases\nthroughyoungadulthoodintomiddleage,aswebecomebetterabletomanageourpersonalrelationshipsandcareers.\nAgreeablenessalsoincreaseswithage,peakingbetween50to70years.However,neuroticismandextroversiontendto\ndeclineslightlywithage. 34.Sincecultureinfluencesone\u2019spersonality,thenWesternideasaboutpersonalitymaynot\nbeapplicabletopeopleofothercultures.Inaddition,Western-basedmeasuresofpersonalityassessmentmaynotbe\nvalidwhenusedtocollectdataonpeoplefromothercultures. 36.Aprojectivetestcouldgivethecliniciancluesabout\ndreams, fears, and personal struggles of which the client may be unaware, since these tests are designed to reveal\nunconscious motivations and attitudes.
