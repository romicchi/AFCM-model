This is the textbook for\nan undergraduate survey course taught at all the universities\nand most of the colleges in the Minnesota State system. Similar\ncourses are taught at institutions around the United States and\nthe world, so the authors have made the text available as an\nopen educational resource that teachers and learners can read,\nadapt, and reuse to meet their needs. We\u2019d like to hear from\npeople who have found the text useful, and we\u2019re always open to\nquestions and suggestions.\nReaders of this text may have varying levels of familiarity\nwith the events of World History before the modern period\nwe will be covering. Occasionally understanding the text may\nrequire a bit of background that will help contextualize the\nmaterial we are covering. This introduction will cover some of\nthat background.\nThe Agricultural Revolution\nFarming developed in a number of different parts of the ancient\nworld, before the beginning of recorded history. That means\nit\u2019s very difficult for historians to describe early agricultural\nsocieties in as much detail as we\u2019d like. Also, because there are\nnone of the written records historians typically use to\nunderstand the past, we rely to a much greater extent on\narchaeologists, anthropologists, and other specialists for the\ndata that informs our histories. And because the science\nsupporting these fields has advanced rapidly in recent years,\nour understanding of this prehistoric period has also changed \u2013\nsometimes abruptly.\n1 2 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA neolithic (stone age) grindstone, used to process grain seeds collected by gatherers\nand later cultivated by farmers.\nFarming was once believed to have developed in the Middle\nEast at sites such as Jericho and Mesopotamia six or seven\nthousand years ago, where the ancestors of modern Europeans\nwere usually credited with the invention of agriculture. More\nrecently, responding to evidence of prehistoric farming in\nAfrica, India, and China, some scholars suggested agriculture\nmay have developed more or less independently in several\nregions of the world. But it was difficult to imagine how such\nparallel development could have occurred, with people in\ndifferent parts of the world not only making the same basic\ndiscoveries but making them pretty much simultaneously. Even\nmore recently, scientists have begun to suspect this confusion\nmay reflect the difficulty of finding archaeological evidence,\nsince plant materials decay in the ground much more quickly\nthan arrowheads and stone spear points. And some have\nsuggested we may have been thinking about agriculture wrong.\nIt now seems likely that agriculture began in a very gradual\nprocess that goes back much farther than we had imagined.\nHumans as a species began in southern Africa some 300,000\nyears ago and after a population crisis about 150,000 years ago,\nmodern humans seem to have left Africa between 80,000 and\n100,000 years ago. They were not the first members of the Modern World History 3\nhuman family that left Africa: Homo erectus, Neanderthals, and\nDenisovans all lived in Europe and Asia until they were\ndisplaced by Homo sapiens.\nA recent (2015) map showing updated theories of human migration out of Africa,\nincluding major archaeological sites.\nIn the early millennia of their spread across the connected\ncontinents of Africa, Europe, and Asia, modern humans lived\nmobile lives as hunter-gatherers. According to archaeologists,\nmany left traces of their presence in the area north of the Black\nSea from about 80,000 to about 50,000 years ago. Although\nthey may have favored certain locations for long periods of\ntime, ancient people were forced to follow the herds they\nhunted and to seek new food sources when conditions changed.\nClimate changed very slowly, but the cycle of glaciation was a\nfactor in human development; especially the most recent ice\nage which began about 36,000 years ago and lasted until about\n11,000 years ago. This ice age displaced both animal and human\npopulations, and also allowed some people to migrate to the\nAmericas, as we will see. 4 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAgriculture probably began when hunter-gatherers began\nfavoring certain plants and weeding around them to help them\ngrow larger and make them easier to reach. At some point,\npeople discovered that seeds dropped into rubbish heaps\nsprouted into new plants. People probably began planting or\ntransplanting their favorites closer to home, so they would not\nalways have to go far, looking for food. This horticulture or\npart-time farming may have begun before these ancient\nhumans began to spread from the Black Sea area westward into\nEurope and east into Asia, which would explain the seemingly\ncoincidental parallel development of farming across much of\nthe globe. Various regions may have each developed their\ndistinctive versions of what we now recognize as agriculture\nfrom a deep pool of common techniques.\nWheat was discovered in a region we call the fertile crescent,\nstretching from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean.\nAs cultivation spread and surpluses of grain were produced,\ncivilizations like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia (today\u2019s Iraq)\nrose between 6,000 and 5,000 years ago. About the same time\n(possibly a bit earlier) residents of the Pearl River estuary in\nwhat is now China began cultivating rice in flooded fields called\npaddies. The three other staple crops of the modern world\n(corn, potatoes, and cassava) were developed between 9,000 and\n7,000 years ago by natives of the Americas, as we will discuss\nbelow.\nThe transition from nomadic hunt-and-gather groups to\nmore complex societies based on agriculture (and the\nspecialization and segmentation of work) allowed for the\ndevelopment of sedentary cultures which established\ngovernments, writing and number systems, and hierarchal\nsocial systems able to build impressive structures, defend (and\nsometimes expand) their borders, and create art and music.\nLet\u2019s look briefly at the ancient societies of Africa, Europe, Asia,\nand the Americas to prepare for our coverage of them in the\nearly modern period in the opening chapters.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 5\n\u2022 Is it significant that historians must rely on information from\nother fields like archaeology to tell the story of the ancient\nworld?\n\u2022 Why does it matter where agriculture first developed?\n\u2022 Does considering human migrations in the deep past affect\nyour opinions on race and ethnicity?\nAncient Kingdoms of North Africa and the Eastern\nMediterranean\nThe ancient dynasties of the Egyptian empire developed along\nthe Nile beginning around 3100 BCE, built on the wheat\nsurpluses made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile\nRiver. Among the most visible and lasting achievements of\nthe Egyptian empires are the pyramids of Giza, built between\n2600-2400 BCE to serve as burial tombs for several emperors.\nThe Egyptian empires lasted for nearly 2300 years before being\nconquered, in succession, by the Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks\nbetween about 700 BCE and 332 BCE.\nThe Giza pyramid complex, with Cairo in the background.\nThe societies of ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, directly\ninfluenced culture and intellectual life in Europe and the Middle\nEast to the present day. Greek dramas and tragedies continue\nto be studied and performed; Pythagoras\u2019 mathematical\ndiscoveries are still taught in schools; and the thinking of 6 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the basis for Western\nphilosophy and political science today. The words \u201cdemocracy\u201d\nand \u201crepublic\u201d come from these ancient Greeks. Greek ideas\nand culture were adopted by the Romans and spread\nthroughout their empire\u2014indeed, many Greek gods became\nRoman gods under different names.\nAncient Rome was a republic for nearly 500 years, expanding\nits territory from the city of Rome on the western coast of\nthe Italian peninsula to nearly all lands surrounding the\nMediterranean Sea, including the former Greek and Egyptian\nempires and even England. The Romans spread their language\n(Latin) and their Latin alphabet to western Europe in particular.\nAfter a period of political crisis, the Republic was replaced with\nan Emperor under Caesar Augustus in 27 BCE.\nThe Egyptian, Greek, Assyrian, Persian, and Roman empires\nall encountered the Hebrew people, who maintained their own\nindependent kingdom of Israel around 1000 BCE. The Hebrew\nprophet Moses, influenced by spiritual ideas from the various\nsocieties, developed the concept of only one god for his people.\nMoses\u2019 monotheism was an unusual innovation in an era when\nmost societies worshipped several gods and many honored the\ngods of other cultures. The Ten Commandments and the laws\nand regulations attributed to Moses in the Torah not only\nformed the basis of Judaism, but also Christianity and later\nIslam\u2014all religions which only worship a single god. Modern World History 7\nThe Roman Empire at its greatest extent, in 117 CE.\nShortly after the Romans conquered the region of Israel, Jesus\nof Nazareth, a Jewish thinker, began preaching a new more\npeaceful and inclusive religion of salvation. He was turned over\nby enemies to the Romans, who crucified him in approximately\n33 CE. His followers, led especially by Paul (said to have never\nmet Jesus), preached that Jesus was the Son of God and invited\nGentiles (people who were not Jews) to join the faith. The new\nreligion was especially embraced by slaves in the Roman\nEmpire who were attracted to the promise of forgiveness, of a\nsingle, all-powerful God\u2019s unending love, and of eternal life after\ndeath. The Romans, who saw the new religion as a challenge to\nstate religious authority, sometimes persecuted Christians.\nIn 330 CE, the Roman Emperor Constantine banned\npersecution of Christians, and by 400 AC, Christianity had\nreplaced the worship of Rome\u2019s traditional gods and goddesses\nas the state religion of the Roman Empire. Because Constantine\nembraced the new faith, the Roman Catholic Church is the\nmost direct descendent of the Roman Empire. The Pope, leader\nof the Catholic Church, still lives in Rome, and the vestments\nof Catholic priests (and the clergy of some other liturgical\nChristian denominations) are similar to those worn by fourth-\ncentury Roman officials. 8 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 On what types of historical evidence do you think references\nto people such as Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad are based?\nHow might these sources differ from the archaeological\nsources mentioned previously?\n\u2022 How do the cultures of ancient Europe continue to influence\nlife in the modern world?\nThe Eastern Roman Empire and the Fall of Rome\nConstantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire to a\nsecond imperial capital in 330 CE. Byzantium, which he\nrenamed Constantinople, was a powerful fortress controlling\nthe Bosphorus Strait which connects the Black Sea to the\nMediterranean. The city of Byzantium, already a thousand\nyears old when Constantine moved there, served as the eastern\nadministrative center of the empire and continued using Greek,\nrather than Latin, as its official language. A somewhat separate\nChristian church developed in this Greek part of the empire,\nbased on the idea that the different archbishops controlled\nspiritual matters as a group, and that the Pope in Rome was\nonly another archbishop, equal to the others. After 1000 CE,\nCatholics in the west and the Greek Orthodox in the east split\nfrom one another.\nDuring the fifth century CE, Germanic tribes from northern\nEurope invaded the Roman Empire. They, in turn, were fleeing\nfrom Attila the Hun and other invaders from Asia. Eventually,\nthe city of Rome itself fell to the barbarians in 476 CE. Western\nEurope was divided up among various Germanic warlords. But\nalthough the empire had ended the Roman Catholic Church\nremained strong. Over the next 500 years, Christianity spread\nthroughout the region and was embraced by local and regional\nrulers. The Church preserved much of the culture of the Roman Modern World History 9\nEmpire, including its language, Latin, which was used in\nliturgies and ceremonies until 1965.\nWhen Rome fell in 476 CE, Western Europe was divided into a number of kingdoms,\nalthough the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire persisted.\nGermanic languages were transformed through their contact\nwith Latin speakers. The English language is a good example\nof both Germanic and Latin influences. Consider how time is\nmeasured: the months of the year are all from the Roman\ncalendar, with the first six months named after Roman gods, and\nJuly and August named after the early emperors Julius Caesar\nand Caesar Augustus. The remaining months are ordinal\nnumbers seven through ten\u2014although in a confusing change,\nthe Catholic Church decided to begin the calendar in January,\nmaking \u201cDecember\u201d the twelfth month instead of the tenth. The\ndays of the week, however, reveal both Latin and Germanic\ninfluences: Saturday, Sunday, and Monday come from the\nsacred Roman orbs in the sky\u2014Spanish, French and other more\nLatin languages continue in this vein for the other four days,\nbut not English, which honors the barbarian gods Tieu, Woden,\nThor, and Frija for the remainder of the week.\nThe Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) lasted for nearly\nanother 1000 years after the fall of Rome. You can tell which 10 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nEuropean peoples were converted by Catholic missionaries and\nwhich were proselytized by Orthodox preachers by looking at\ntheir alphabets\u2014Russia, the Ukraine, and Bulgaria, for example,\nuse the Greek-based \u201cCyrillic\u201d alphabet, while all western\nEuropean languages use a version of the Latin alphabet.\nIslam and Its Influence\nIn 610 CE, the Prophet Muhammad began preaching and\norganizing a new religion\u2014Islam\u2014on the Arabian Peninsula in\nthe region of Mecca. The Prophet\u2019s teachings, later gathered in\nthe Holy Quran, built upon Judaism and Christianity. Mecca\nitself was long a site of religious pilgrimage honoring the\nHebrew patriarch Abraham, and Jesus is considered as an\nimportant prophet in Islam. By the time of Muhammad\u2019s\npassing in 632, Islam was well-established in the eastern Arabian\nPeninsula; within the next one hundred years, it became the\ndominant religion in North Africa, the Middle East, and Persia.\nBy 1200, Muslim rulers also dominated South Asia and the\nIberian Peninsula. Modern World History 11\nIslam brought stability to\nthe region and trade,\nlearning, and the exchange of\nideas flourished. The extent\nof Muslim trade is notable in\nthe establishment of a center\nof Islamic study in Timbuktu\nin the middle of northern\nSub-Saharan Africa, located\nacross the Sahara Desert from\nMecca in today\u2019s Mali.\nReligious conversion often\naccompanied Arab merchant\nactivity. Indeed, the nation\nwith the largest Muslim\npopulation in the world,\nIndonesia, is a South East\nAn 18th-century map of Mecca, showing\nAsian archipelago located\nthe Al-Haram Mosque and the Ka\u2019bah,\nthousands of miles from the\nwhich millions of Muslims visit on\npilgrimages every year. Arabian Peninsula; Arab\ntraders first introduced their\nreligion there in the 1200s. The Arab world benefitted from\nrelatively stable administrations and commercial links that\nallowed merchants to bring new technology, science, and\nmathematics from India and China to the region, which Arab\nscholars refined in their own centers of learning.\nMuslims, like Christians, Jews, and followers of all other world\nreligions, may share common sacred writings and liturgical\ntraditions, but are also divided by different theological\ninterpretations and religious practices. In Islam, a principal\ndivision stems from an early debate over who should have led\nthe religion after the Prophet: should it have been a member of\nhis family, or simply anyone who was an effective and dynamic\nleader? Sunnis, 90% of Muslims today, stem from the group who\nbelieved in the latter, while Shi\u2019ites, some 10% of all Muslims,\ninclude the (often martyred) descendants of the Prophet as early\nprinciple imams (spiritual leaders) of Islam. As will be discussed\nlater, the rulers of Persia\u2014today\u2019s Iran\u2014embraced Shi\u2019ism,\nwhile most of their neighbors are Sunni. Although Sunnis and 12 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nShi\u2019ites fought one another in the early years of Islam, many\nhave also lived together in relative peace for centuries, until the\nlast few decades (which will be examined in later chapters).\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How do you think the memory of the Roman Empire affected\nEuropeans?\n\u2022 How did conflict between Muslims and Christians shape\nEuropean history?\nThe Center of World Population: Asia\nAfter thousands of years of hunting and gathering, the ancient\npeople of northern China began cultivating millet and rice at\nabout the same time and in much the same way that people of\nthe Middle East grew wheat and people of the Americas grew\nmaize, potatoes, and cassava. China\u2019s recorded history began\nabout 2000 BCE, or over four thousand years ago, so historians\nhave a pretty good idea what happened there in the distant\npast. Based on irrigated rice agriculture, the population of China\ngrew to 50 to 60 million people as early as 2,000 years ago. This\npopulation was originally divided into several small kingdoms\nwhose ruling families were connected through political\nmarriages. Beginning in 221 BCE, the most influential and\npowerful family organized the kingdoms into an empire\ncovering much of the territory of modern China. This empire\nlasted over two thousand years under a series of over a dozen\ndynasties until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the\nestablishment of the Republic of China.\nIn the region that is now Pakistan and India, Indus Valley cities such as\nMohenjo-daro and Harappa, which reached their maturity by about 2600 BCE,\neach housed 30,000 to 60,000 people. These cultures grew on an agricultural\nbase focused on wheat, barley, and millet. The permanent nature of sedentary\nagricultural societies led thinkers to consider in more complex ways how people Modern World History 13\nshould live correctly in the world, which led to the establishment of both religious\nand civil structures that are the ancestors and sources of many of the world\ngovernments and religions which still exist today. During the Vedic period in\nIndia, Hinduism took root beginning around 2000 BCE, based on stories of gods\nand goddesses, and their relationships with one another and the world. The\nspiritual richness of South Asia inspired the Buddha (who was originally from\ntoday\u2019s Nepal) to engage in his own spiritual journey to enlightenment in the fifth\ncentury BCE. Buddhist ideas inspired the spiritual aspects of Chinese, Japanese,\nand Southeast Asian thought.\nThe extent of the Roman and Han Empires around the year 1 CE.\nThe earliest emperors of China began large public\nworks programs including construction of what\nthey called Long Walls which later formed the\nbasis of the Great Wall, partly to protect from\nnorthern tribes and partly to expand their territory\nnorthward. Around 200 BCE, the second Chinese\ndynasty, the Han, established a trade route called\nthe Silk Road linking China through central Asia\nwith Europe. Artifacts from the Roman Empire\nhave been found in China and silk (which China\ndeveloped before 3000 BCE) became a luxury\nfabric in Greece and Rome. The next dynasty, the\nSui, dug the Grand Canal to connect the Yellow\nand Yangtze Rivers in the sixth century CE. The\ncanal allowed rice, wheat, and millet to be 14 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ntransported on a protected inland waterway\ninstead of being shipped on the ocean where\nshipments could be threatened by pirates. China\nalso led the world in iron, copper, and porcelain\nproduction as well as in the \u201cFour Great\nInventions\u201d: the compass, gunpowder, paper-\nmaking, and printing.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Is it significant that China and India have always been centers\nof world population?\n\u2022 Why do agricultural surpluses encourage the building of\ncities, kingdoms, and empires?\n\u2022 Is it surprising to you that the Han and Roman Empires\nexisted at the same time and that there was trade between\nAsia and Europe via the Silk Road?\nThe Isolated Americas\nThe people living in the Americas were separated by climate change from Eurasia\nfor nearly 12,000 years after the end of the ice age that had created Beringia\nbetween what is now Alaska and Siberia, and allowed Eurasians to cross over\ninto the Americas. During this period, which we should remember is twice as\nlong as recorded history, the Native Americans were not idle. When they had\narrived in the Americas, they found very few large animal species available\nto domesticate. Like the Europeans, Asians, and Africans, Native Americans\nexperienced their own agricultural revolution after a long period of hunting\nand gathering; but instead of domesticating cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs,\nand chickens, Americans developed certain plants, creating three of the world\u2019s\ncurrent top five staple crops. Modern World History 15\nAn image depicting Teosinte, a Maize-teosinte hybrid, and Maize, developed 7,000 to\n10,000 years ago in central Mexico.\nStaple crops produce the foods that provide the greatest percentage of the calories\npeople eat. It might surprise you that today only about fifteen staple crops account\nfor 90% of the calories people eat every day. The top five are responsible for\nnearly three quarters, including feed for the animals whose meat we eat. They\nwere all discovered/invented by ancient people between six and ten thousand\nyears ago, and three of the five were invented in the Americas. The world\u2019s five\ntop five staples today (in order of importance) are maize (corn), rice, wheat,\npotatoes, and cassava. Only rice and wheat were known to Europe, Asia, and\nAfrica before contact with the Americas. Natives of what is now Mexico\ndeveloped maize from a native grass called teosinte beginning about nine\nthousand years ago, and its use spread to nearly every part of the Americas. Over\ngenerations, women (who were the farmers in ancient Mexico) selectively bred\nthe grass to produce more and bigger seeds. Maize is currently the most important\nstaple in the world for both human and animal feed, as well as in industrial uses\nlike High Fructose Corn Syrup, plastics and fuel.\nAndean natives in what is now Peru and Bolivia created many varieties of\npotatoes beginning 10,000 years ago. Andean women developed different\nvarieties for different growing conditions and learned to freeze dry potatoes for\nlong-term storage. And the people of the Amazon region not only discovered\nmanioc trees growing in the rainforest, but developed processes to turn the trees\u2019\npoisonous roots into cassava (what we know as tapioca) between 10,000 and 16 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n7,000 years ago. Raw cassava root is toxic. So in addition to domesticating the\nplant, Amazonian tree farmers had to develop technologies (combinations of\nboiling, drying, and chemical leaching) to remove the cyanide compounds and\nmake the manioc useful. Along with rice and wheat developed in Eurasia, maize,\npotatoes, and manioc are the most important staple crops in the modern world,\nfeeding billions of people. We have ancient native Americans to thank for them.\nCassava roots need to be processed to remove poisons before they can be eaten.\nOf course, eating nothing but maize, potatoes, and cassava would be a very\nbland diet. The indigenous in central Mexico developed other plants to flavor\ntheir cuisine: the various types of hot peppers, beans, and tomatoes present in\nMexican food today were enjoyed by the Olmecs, Toltecs, and Mexica hundreds\nof years before their encounter with Europeans in the sixteenth century. The\nMeso-Americans also ground cocoa beans and added hot water, peppers, and\nhoney to make hot chocolate\u2013even today, millions of Latin Americans begin and\nend their day with a cup, prepared in a traditional olleta with a hand-held batidor,\nusing chunks of chocolate. However, such a delicious drink was originally\nreserved for the nobility, and cocoa beans themselves were often used as a kind\nof currency.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 17\n\u2022 Why would it matter that there were no large animal species\nin the Americas for natives to domesticate?\n\u2022 Is it significant that the people breeding new staple crops in\nthe Americas were mostly women?\nWe will look more closely in the next several chapters at the\ncultures of all these regions, as they entered the modern era.\nAlthough the people of each continent and region developed\ndifferent traditions and customs, their agriculturally-based\ncultures shared a lot of similarities and their civilizations were\nall comparably advanced at the beginning of our survey. with\nthat introduction, let\u2019s begin.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Molino_neoli\u0301tico_de_vaive\u0301n \u00a9 Jos\u00e9-Manuel Benito\n\u00c1lvarez is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution\nShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Putative_migration_waves_out_of_Africa \u00a9 Saioa\nL\u00f3pez, Lucy van Dorp and Garrett Hellenthal is\nlicensed under a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Pyramids_of_the_Giza_Necropolis \u00a9 KennyOMG is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 Roman_Empire_Trajan_117AD \u00a9 Tataryn is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Europe_and_the_Near_East_at_476_AD \u00a9 Guriezous\nis licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 OldmapofMecca \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 RomanandHanEmpiresAD1 \u00a9 Gabagool is licensed\nunder a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Maize-teosinte \u00a9 John Doebley is licensed under a CC 18 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Manihot_esculenta_dsc07325 \u00a9 David Monniaux is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense [1]\nModern World History Begins in\nAsia\nSome of the 8,000 Terracotta Soldiers from the 209 BCE grave of the first emperor, Qin\nShi Huang, discovered in 1974 by farmers in Xi\u2019an China.\n19 20 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nWe begin our survey of modern world history in Asia. This may\nsurprise many who grew up believing that most of the important\nevents of modern history happened in the West. Don\u2019t worry,\nwe\u2019ll add Europe, Africa, and the Americas to the story soon\nenough. But before we do that, it\u2019s important to understand\nthat the histories of China and India are as old as western\nhistory if not older, and Asia has always been the center of\nworld population. So, let\u2019s look at how Asia achieved that global\npreeminence.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, civilization began in India\nabout 4,600 years ago and China\u2019s recorded history began about\n2000 BCE. Based on irrigated rice agriculture, the population\nof China grew to 50 to 60 million people as early as 2,000\nyears ago. This population was originally divided into several\nsmall kingdoms whose ruling families were connected through\npolitical marriages. Beginning in 221 BCE, the Chinese created\nan empire that lasted over two thousand years under a series\nThe early imperial\nof more than a dozen dynasties.\ngovernments began construction of\nthe called Long Walls, and dug the\nGrand Canal to connect the Yellow and\nYangtze Rivers in the sixth century CE.\nChina held a monopoly on the\ncreation of silk, which was a closely-\nheld state secret for millennia, and led\nthe world in iron, copper, and\nporcelain production as well as a\nvariety of technological inventions\nincluding the compass, gunpowder,\npaper-making, mechanical clocks, and\nmoveable type printing.\nThe social stability that allowed Chinese culture to produce Modern World History 21\nthese innovations was based on not only the imperial form of\ngovernment, but on an elaborate system of professional civil\nservice. The early establishment of a professional\nadministrative class of \u201cscholar-officials\u201d was a remarkable\nelement of imperial Chinese rule that made it more stable,\nlonger-lasting, and at least potentially less oppressive than\nempires in other parts of the world. The imperial courts sent\nthousands of highly-educated administrators throughout the\nempire and China was ruled not by hereditary nobles or even\nelected representatives, but by a class of men who had received\nrigorous training and had passed very stringent examinations to\nprove themselves qualified to lead.\nThe Liji or Book of Rites was one of the five Classic Confucian texts.\nYoung men who wanted to become civil administrators in\nChina entered training schools that concentrated on calligraphy\nand the teachings of Confucius. Calligraphy in China equaled\nliteracy. Chinese language is based on characters rather than on\nan alphabet, and is said to be the world\u2019s oldest continually-used\nwriting system. A dictionary published in 1039 CE listed 53,525\ncharacters, and a 2004 Chinese dictionary included 106,230.\nMost Chinese words are made of one or more characters. For\ncomparison, the English alphabet uses 26 letters and the average\nAmerican has a practical vocabulary of about 10,000 words.\nWhile a foreigner learning Chinese today would be judged 22 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nproficient on the national exam (the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi or\nHSK) with a vocabulary of about 9,000 words, they would need\nto know the 2,865 characters that made up these words in order\nto study at a Chinese university or work in a Chinese business.\nIn addition to literacy, civil\nservice training focused on\nthe philosophy of Confucius,\na Chinese philosopher who\nhad lived from 551 to 479\nBCE. Kong Fuzi (Master\nKong\u2014he is known as\n\u201cConfucius\u201d in the West)\ntaught principles derived\nfrom what he described as old\nChinese classics. Confucius\nclaimed he was not so much\ncreating a new philosophy as\npreserving and combining\nthe best traditions of the past,\nwhich was very appropriate\nNow about 600 years old, this portrait of\nConfucius was drawn nearly two thousand in a culture devoted to\nyears after his death. reverence of its ancestors. He\ntraveled as a teacher and\nadvisor of local rulers, and his practical philosophy spread.\nConfucian ideas about conduct focus on five basic virtues:\nseriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and kindness.\nWhen a student asked him \u201cIs there any one word that could\nguide a person throughout life?\u201d Confucius replied, \u201cHow about\n\u2018reciprocity\u2019! Never impose on others what you would not\nchoose for yourself.\u201d (Analects XV.24) The Chinese, who valued\nsilver higher than gold, called this the silver rule. Confucian\nsocial morality is based on this reciprocity and on empathy and\nunderstanding others rather than on divinely ordained rules.\nAlthough Confucius occasionally talked about heaven and an\nafterlife, his moral system was not based on the idea of\nsupernatural rewards and punishments. Confucian morality is\nsecular rather than religious, which left room for the Emperor\nto be a representative of Divinity and claim \u201cthe Mandate of\nHeaven\u201d without the Chinese Empire becoming a theocracy. Modern World History 23\nMing Dynasty painting of the highest-level Confucian examination at the imperial\npalace.\nCenturies after his death, Confucian ideas became the basis\nof civil service education in imperial China. Scholars would\ntravel to testing centers and sit for exams that often took days\nto complete. They brought food and a bedroll and remained\nin their small testing cells until they had completed the exam.\nThere were four increasingly-difficult levels of testing: County,\nDistrict, Province, and Imperial. The highest exam was\nadministered by the emperor himself and passing it qualified\na scholar for assignments in the imperial court. The exams\nwere extremely difficult and at each level more people failed\nthan passed. But the exams were also democratic in a way:\neven a scholar from a poor family could take the exam if he\ncould educate himself; success on the top exam was a ticket to\nthe highest levels of imperial society. Over the centuries, the\nscholars became an upper class in Chinese society, a gentry\nbased on educational merit rather than merely on birth or\nwealth. Although there were times when the system was\ncorrupted, for most of its history Chinese society was run by 24 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\neducated men rather than by nobles who had inherited their\npositions.\nConfucianism is not a\nperfect philosophy, since it\naccepted and even reinforced\ncertain societal injustices.\nConfucius incorporated\ntraditional Chinese ancestor-\nworship into his system,\nwhich implied a degree of\nsacredness for ancestral\npractices. For this reason,\nConfucian principles\nperpetuated and exacerbated\nthe oppression of women,\nwho had no standing in the\nmale-dominated family\nstructure.

In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan, the\ngrandson of Genghis Khan, defeated the Chinese army and\nestablished the Yuan dynasty, which that lasted 98 years until\n1368. Although Kublai Khan never completely conquered 26 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nChina despite 65 years of struggle, Yuan rule marked the first\ntime the Chinese Empire was controlled by foreigners.

Zhu joined forces with a rebel army called\nthe Red Turbans and rose quickly through the ranks. Zhu\nmarried the daughter of the founder of the Red Turbans and\ninherited his leadership position after eliminating several rival\ngenerals. In 1356, the 28-year old general conquered the ancient\ncity of Nanjing and made it his base. In 1368, Zhu led his troops\nnorth and chased the Yuans out of their capital of Dadu (now\nBeijing).

Remembering the\nsuffering and famines during his youth, partly caused by the\nflooding of the Yangtze River, Hongwu promoted public works\nand infrastructure projects including new dikes and irrigation\nsystems to serve an agricultural system dominated by paddy\nrice. He organized the building or repair of nearly 41,000\nreservoirs and planted over a billion trees in his land\nreclamation program.

Yongle ruled through an extensive network of\ncourt eunuchs who formed his palace guard and secret police.\nYongle repaired and reopened China\u2019s Grand Canal, the\n1,104-mile waterway that linked the Yellow and Yangxi Rivers\nand enabled the new capital to receive rice shipments from the\nsouth. Between 1406 and 1420, he also directed 100,000 artisans\nand 1 million laborers in building the Forbidden City in Beijing\nas a permanent imperial residence.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How did the early Ming emperors try to change the society\nthey ruled? Would you consider most of their changes\npositive or negative for the Chinese people? 30 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nOne of Yongle\u2019s most\ntrusted subordinates was the\neunuch admiral Zheng He\n(1371-1433), the son of a\nMuslim soldier from\nsouthwestern China. At the\nage of ten Zheng He was\ncaptured, castrated, and sent\nto serve Prince Zhu Di in\nDadu. Castration was a\ncommon practice throughout\nthe ancient and early modern\nworld, used in China to insure\nloyalty by eliminating conflict\nbetween family and duty.\nEducated in the prince\u2019s\nhousehold, Zheng He became\na loyal soldier and later a Statue of Admiral Zheng He located in\ngeneral. Zheng He helped Melaka, Malaysia.\nZhu Di depose his nephew\nand take control of the empire, and the new Yongle Emperor\nappointed Zheng He admiral of his fleet and sent him on seven\nexpeditions between 1405 and 1430. Modern World History 31\nZheng He\u2019s flagship compared to the caravel Santa Maria used by Columbus 87 years\nlater.\nZheng He\u2019s first expedition left China in July 1405 with 62\nlarge ships, over 200 smaller ships, and 28,000 soldiers. The\nlargest ships were 425 feet long, over six times the length of\nthe 65-foot caravels the Spanish and Portuguese would use on\ntheir explorations nearly a century later. China\u2019s four-decked,\n1,500-ton flagships had shallow drafts to allow them to navigate\nin river estuaries and watertight bulkheads to protect them from\nsinking. Their nine masts were up to two hundred feet tall and\nfitted with rattan sails.\nZheng He\u2019s fleet was not interested in establishing colonies,\nbut in exacting tribute and opening trade relationships\nthroughout South Asia. The fleet traded for ivory, spices,\nointments, exotic woods, giraffes, zebras, and ostriches; while\nalso demanding tribute from the rulers of nations like Sumatra\nand Sri Lanka. Often, when local leaders seemed unwilling to\nsubmit, Zheng He seized them and brought them to Beijing\nwhere they could be convinced of the overwhelming power\nof the Chinese Empire. Among the places Zheng visited were\nBangkok, Java, Melaka, Burma, the east and west coasts of India, 32 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nHormuz in the Persian Gulf, Jedda on the Red Sea, and\nMogadishu and Mombasa on the east coast of Africa. Ninety-\nfive delegations from Southeast Asia and other more distant\nnations reached the Yongle Emperor\u2019s court during his 22-year\nreign, and he established a College of Translators to handle all\nthe correspondence he received from foreign contacts. Zheng\nHe\u2019s seven expeditions extracted tribute from many\nneighboring kingdoms, and Yongle trusted him so completely\nthat he sent Zheng He blank scrolls with his imperial seal on\nthem, to use in whatever way he chose.\nThe seven voyages of Zheng He, 1405-1433.\nFor many centuries the voyages of Zheng He were not\nfeatured in histories of China, even in China itself. As historians\nhave rediscovered these expeditions, the superiority of Chinese\nnaval technology has challenged the belief that western nations\nwere the first to establish maritime power. One of the most\ninteresting questions about Zheng He\u2019s voyages is, \u201cWhy did\nthey end?\u201d China did not establish offshore colonies, perhaps\npartly because there was so much territory available on the\nempire\u2019s northern and western frontiers. China\u2019s rapidly-\ngrowing population was a ready market for most of the empire\u2019s Modern World History 33\nfarm products and manufactures, and the international trade\nthat interested China already found its way to the empire\nwithout much effort on China\u2019s part. And unlike European\nkings, the Yongle emperor was not interested in evangelizing\nConfucianism or Buddhism to the rest of the world\u2014the\nSpanish and Portuguese, in particular, wanted to convert the\nworld to Catholic Christianity, which became not only a goal but\na justification for conquest and colonization.\nWhen the Yongle Emperor\u2019s son and grandson inherited the\nthrone, Zheng He\u2019s expeditions gradually became less of a\npriority. After a final voyage in 1433, expeditions were halted\nand the fleet was retired and ultimately burned. Ending China\u2019s\nnavy was one of the major changes made by Yongle\u2019s\ndescendants. The burning of the Chinese fleet left a power\nvacuum in the South China Sea, which in the sixteenth century\nwas filled by Japanese and Chinese coastal pirates. Finally,\nshortly after Yongle and Zheng He\u2019s deaths, China was\nchallenged from the north again. Sixteen years after Zheng He\u2019s\nfinal expedition, Yongle\u2019s great grandson, the sixth Ming\nemperor, was captured and held hostage by Mongol raiders in\n1449.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What do you think was the most significant element of Zheng\nHe\u2019s seafaring missions?\n\u2022 With such a commanding technological lead, why did China\nturn away from the outside world and suspend exploration?\n\u2022 What might the world look like now, if the Chinese Empire\nhad continued along the lines begun by Zheng He? 34 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Great Wall of China at Jinshanling\nThe alarmed Chinese turned their attention to their border\ndefenses and rebuilt the crumbling Long Walls into a 1,550-mile\nlong fortification with hundreds of guard towers. The Long\nWalls had existed since the beginning of the Chinese Empire,\nbut had failed to hold off Mongol invaders. Under the Mings the\nGreat Wall was improved and extended, especially around the\ncapital of Beijing and the agricultural heartland in the Liaodong\nProvince north of the Korean Peninsula. These defenses enabled\nthe Chinese population to rise from 100 million in 1500 to\n160 million in 1600. However, the threat of a Manchurian land\ninvasion from the north was taken very seriously, to the\ndetriment of authorizing further naval expeditions. China\u2019s\nturning away from the ocean was a momentous decision in\nworld history, opening the door for Southeast Asians, Muslims,\nand eventually Europeans to dominate the Indian Ocean and\nthe Pacific. Modern World History 35\nAs the generations passed,\nMing emperors and their\ncourts became increasingly\nisolated in the Forbidden City\nthe Yongle Emperor had\nbuilt. Some were\nincompetent rulers, others\nwere just uninterested in\nruling. Similar to other new\nimperial dynasties, the Ming\nDynasty began by\nconcentrating political power\nin the Emperor and in the\ncivil servants chosen through\nthe Confucian examination\nprocess. As time passed, a\nruling class grew and power\nThe Forbidden City as depicted in 1500. shifted as the new elite\nprotected their lands and\npossessions from taxation. Corrupt officials siphoned funds\ndesignated for public works into their own pockets and\ninfrastructure such as dams and dikes crumbled. Eventually,\nirrigation systems failed and peasants died in widespread\nfamines.\nAt the same time, Manchuria was being unified under strong\nmilitary leaders who had adopted Chinese ways and who even\nemployed Confucian administrators. In 1644, a Ming\ngovernment official dealing with a local peasant insurrection\nthat threatened Beijing asked the Manchurians for military aid.\nOf course, once the Manchu armies were past the Wall, there\nwas no way to send them back. They took control of Beijing and\ndeclared the end of the Ming Empire and the beginning of a\nnew dynasty, the Qing (pure). 36 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nWe will return later to the\nhistory of China, the Qing\nDynasty, and what came after.\nFor now, the point of\nbeginning modern world\nhistory with China is that in\nterms of population and\neconomic power, it was the\ncenter of the world in 1500\nwhen our survey of Modern\nWorld History begins. In\n1500, the Chinese population\nwas growing rapidly, the\nMing Empire had a standing\narmy of over a million\nsoldiers and the Chinese navy\nof Zheng He had recently Qing emperor Qianlong in ceremonial\nManchurian armor, ca. 1758.\nprojected the empire\u2019s power\nthroughout Asia. The Chinese\neconomy produced one quarter of the world\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) in 1500, followed by India which produced\nnearly another quarter. In comparison, the fourteen nations of\nwestern Europe produced just about half of China\u2019s GDP or only\none-eight of the global total production. The largest European\neconomy, in Italy, produced only about one-sixth of China\u2019s\noutput.\nThe Ming Empire\u2019s population in 1500 was about 125 million.\nThe next largest empires were Southern India\u2019s Vijayanagara\nEmpire (16 million), followed by the Inca Empire of South\nAmerica (12 million), the Ottoman Empire (11 million), the\nSpanish Empire (about 8.5 million), and the Ashikaga Shogunate\nof Japan (8 million). Keep the immense mass of China and\nthe gravity exerted by its economy in mind as we move on to\ndiscuss events like the creation of a Spanish colonial empire\nin the Americas\u2014Spanish-American mines produced the silver\nthat accidentally became the world\u2019s currency, filling not only\nthe treasuries Europe, but also that of China in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries.

They contain a wealth of information about Ming\nChina, including twenty-two references to Chinese Admiral\nZheng He and his diplomatic voyages, dated from July 1405\nto March 1431. Here are some entries, describing Zheng He\u2019s\nmissions and incidents related to them. In several, Zheng is\ndescribed as being sent as an emissary to fan countries. The\nMandarin word fan translates roughly as ordinary or mortal,\nsuggesting the attitude of the Chinese emperors toward 44 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nforeign nations and their rulers. The English word \u201cenfeoff\u201d is\nalso not well known. It means to grant something to a lesser\nlord or noble, like a fiefdom. Entries are dated by imperial era\ndates, with western calendar dates in parentheses:\n\u201cThe eunuch Zheng He and others were sent to take\nImperial orders of instruction to the various countries in the\nWestern Ocean, and to confer upon the kings of those\ncountries patterned fine silks and variegated thin silks\ninterwoven with gold thread, as appropriate.\u201d\nYongle: Year 3, Month 6, Day 15 (11 Jul 1405)\n\u201cThe Eunuch Director Zheng He who had been sent to the\nvarious countries of the Western Ocean, returned, bringing\nthe pirate Chen Zuyi and others in fetters. Previously, when\nhe had arrived at Old Port, he came across Zuyi and so on and\nsent people to bring them to negotiated pacification. Zuyi and\nthe others feigned surrender but secretly plotted to attack the\nImperial army. He and the others found out about this and,\nmarshalling the troops, prepared defenses. When the forces\nled by Zuyi attacked, He sent his troops out to do battle. Zuyi\nsuffered a great defeat. Over 5,000 of the bandit gang were\nkilled, while ten of the bandit ships were burnt and seven\ncaptured. Further, two false bronze seals were seized and\nthree prisoners, including Zuyi, were taken alive. When they\narrived at the capital, it was ordered that all the prisoners be\nbeheaded.\u201d\nYongle: Year 5, Month 9, Day 2 (2 Oct 1407)\n\u201cThe eunuch Zheng He and others, who had been sent\nas envoys to the various countries in the Western Ocean,\nreturned and presented Yalie Kunaier, the captured king of\nthe country of Sri Lanka, and his family members. Previously,\nHe and the others had been sent as envoys to the various\nfan countries. However, when they reached Sri Lanka, Yalie\nKunaier was insulting and disrespectful. He wished to harm\nHe, but He came to know of this and left. Yalie Kunaier also\nacted in an unfriendly way to neighboring countries and Modern World History 45\nrepeatedly intercepted and robbed their envoys. All the fan\ncountries suffered from his actions. When He returned, he\nagain passed Sri Lanka and the king enticed him to the\ncountry. The king then had his son Nayan demand gold, silver\nand precious objects, but He would not give these to him.\nThe king then secretly dispatched over 50,000 fan troops to\nrob He\u2019s ships. They also felled trees to create obstructions\nand impede He\u2019s route of return, so that he could not render\nassistance. He and the others found out about this and they\ngathered their force and set off back to their ships. However,\nthe route had already been blocked. He thus spoke to his\nsubordinates, saying: \u2018The majority of the troops have already\nbeen dispatched. The middle of the country will be empty.\u2019\nHe also said: \u2018Our merchants and troops are isolated and\nnervous and will be unable to act. If they are attacked by\nsurprise, the attackers will achieve their purpose.\u2019 Thus, he\nsecretly ordered persons to go to the ships by another route\nwith orders that the government troops were to fight to the\ndeath in opposing the attackers. He then personally led 2,000\nof his troops through a by-path and attacked the royal city by\nsurprise. They took the city and captured alive Yalie Kunaier,\nhis family members and chieftains. The fan army returned\nand surrounded the city and several battles were fought, but\nHe greatly defeated them. He and the others subsequently\nreturned to the Court. The assembled ministers requested\nthat the king be executed. The Emperor pitied the king for his\nstupidity and ignorance and leniently ordered that he and the\nothers be released and given food and clothing. The Ministry\nof Rites was ordered to deliberate on and select a worthy\nmember of the family to be established as the country\u2019s king\nin order to handle the country\u2019s sacrifices.\u201d\nYongle: Year 9, Month 6, Day 16 (6 Jul 1411)\n\u201cAs the envoys from the various countries of Calicut, Java,\nMelaka, Champa, Sri Lanka, Mogadishu, Liushan, Nanboli,\nBulawa, Aden, Samudera, Malin, Lasa, Hormuz, Cochin,\nNanwuli, Shaliwanni and Pahang, as well as from the Old\nPort Pacification Superintendency, were departing to return\nhome, suits of clothing made from patterned fine silks were\nconferred upon all of them. The eunuch Zheng He and others 46 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwere sent with Imperial orders as well as embroidered fine\nsilks, silk gauzes, variegated thin silks and other goods to\nconfer upon the kings of these countries, to confer a seal\nupon Keyili, the king of the country of Cochin, and to enfeoff a\nmountain in his country as the \u2018Mountain Which Protects the\nCountry\u2019.\nThe Emperor personally composed and conferred an\ninscription for the tablet, as follows:\n\u2018The civilizing influences and Heaven and Earth intermingle.\nEverything which is covered and contained has been placed in\nthe charge of the Moulder, who manifests the benevolence of\nthe Creator. The world does not have two ultimate principles\nand people do not have two hearts. They are sorrowful or\nhappy in the same way and have the same feelings and\ndesires. How can they be divided into the near and the\ndistant!\nOne who is outstanding in ruling the people should do his\nbest to treat the people as his children. The Book of Odes\nsays: `The Imperial domain stretches for thousands of li, and\nthere the people have settled, while the borders reach to\nthe four seas.\u2019 The Book of Documents says: \u2018To the East,\nextending to the sea, to the West reaching to the shifting\nsands and stretching to the limits of North and South, culture\nand civilizing influences reach to the four seas.\u2019 I rule all under\nHeaven and soothe and govern the Chinese and the yi. I look\non all equally and do not differentiate between one and the\nother. I promote the ways of the ancient Sagely Emperors and\nPerspicacious Kings, so as to accord with the will of Heaven\nand Earth. I wish all of the distant lands and foreign regions to\nhave their proper places.\nThose who respond to the influences and move towards\nculture are not singular. The country of Cochin is far away in\nthe South-west, on the shore of the vast ocean, further distant\nthan the other fan countries. It has long inclined towards\nChinese culture and been accepting of civilizing influences.\nWhen the Imperial orders arrived, the people there went\ndown on their hands and knees and were greatly excited.\nThey loyally came to allegiance and then, looking to Heaven,\nthey bowed and all said: `How fortunate we are that the Modern World History 47\ncivilizing influences of the Chinese sages should reach us. For\nthe last several years, the country has had fertile soil, and\nthe people have had houses in which to live, enough fish and\nturtles to eat, and enough cloth and silk to make clothes.\nParents have looked after their children and the young have\nrespected their elders. Everything has been prosperous and\npleasing. There has been no oppression or contention. In\nthe mountains no savage beasts have appeared and in the\nstreams no noxious fishes have been seen. The sea has\nbrought forth treasures and the forests have produced\nexcellent woods. Everything has been in bountiful supply,\nseveral times more bountiful than in ordinary times. There\nhave been no destructive winds, and damaging rains have\nnot occurred. Confusion has been eliminated and there is no\nevil to be found. This is all indeed the result of the civilizing\ninfluences of the Sage.\u2019 I possess but slight virtuous power.\nHow could I have been capable of this! Is it not the elders and\npeople who brought this about? I am now enfeoffing Keyili as\nking of the country and conferring upon him a seal so that\nhe can govern the people. I am also enfeoffing the mountain\nin the country as \u2018Mountain Which Protects the Country\u2019. An\nengraved tablet is to be erected on this mountain to record\nthese facts forever. It will also be engraved as follows: The\nhigh peak which rules the land, guards this ocean state, It\nspits fire and fumes, bringing great prosperity to the country\nbelow, It brings rain and sunshine in a timely way, and\nsoothes away troubles, It brings fertile soil and drives off evil\nvapors, It shelters the people, and eliminates calamities and\ndisharmony, Families are joyful together, and people have\nplenty throughout the year, The mountain\u2019s height is as the\nocean\u2019s depths! This poem is inscribed to record all for\nprosperity.\u201d\nYongle: Year 14, Month 12, Day 10 (28 Dec 1416)\n\u201cThe envoys from the 16 countries of Hormuz and so on\ndeparted on their return to their countries. Paper money and\nbiao-li of silks were conferred upon them. In addition, the\nEunuch Director Zheng He and others were sent with Imperial\norders, together with brocades, fine silks, silk gauzes, 48 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndamasks and thin silks to confer upon the kings of these\ncountries. They departed together with the envoys.\u201d\nYongle: Year 19, Month 1, Day 30 (3 Mar 1421)\n\u201cThe Eunuch Director Zheng He and others were sent with\nan Imperial proclamation to go and instruct the various fan\ncountries. The proclamation read: \u2018I have respectfully taken\non the mandate of Heaven and reverently inherited the Great\nRule from the Taizu Gao Emperor, the Taizong Wen Emperor\nand the Renzong Zhao Emperor. I rule over the ten thousand\nstates, manifest the supreme benevolence of my ancestors\nand spread peace to all things. I have already issued a general\namnesty to all under Heaven and declared the\ncommencement of the Xuande reign. All has begun anew.\nYou, the various fan countries far across the ocean, will not\nyet have heard. Now I am especially sending the Eunuch\nDirectors Zheng He and Wang Jinghong carrying this\nproclamation with which to instruct you. You must all respect\nand accord with the Way of Heaven, care for your people and\nkeep them in peace. Thus will you all enjoy the prosperity\nof Great Peace.\u2019 Variegated silks, as appropriate, were to be\nconferred upon the rulers or chiefs of all 20 countries through\nwhich the eunuchs were to pass, including Hormuz, Sri Lanka,\nCalicut, Melaka, Cochin, Bulawa, Mogadishu, Nanboli,\nSamudera, Lasa, Liushan, Aru, Ganbali, Aden, Zuofaer, Zhubu,\nJiayile and so on, as well as the Old Port Pacification\nSuperintendency.\nXuande: Year 5, Month 6, Day 9 (29 Jun 1430)\n\u201cThe chieftain Wubaochina and others from the country\nof Melaka, arrived at the Court. They advised that the king\nof their country wanted to personally come to Court and\noffer tribute, but that he had been obstructed by the king\nof the country of Siam. They also said that Siam had long\nwanted to invade their country and that their country wanted\nto memorialize but had had no one who could write the\nmemorial. At this time, the king had ordered that these three\nministers secretly attach themselves to a Samuderan tribute\nship and come to Court. They requested that the Court send Modern World History 49\npeople to instruct the king of Siam to no longer oppress or\nmistreat their country and that thereby they would be\nunendingly grateful for the Court\u2019s grace. The Emperor\nordered the Auxiliary Ministry of Rites to confer rewards upon\nWubaochina and the others and to send them back to their\ncountry with the ships of the eunuch director Zheng He.\nZheng He was ordered to take Imperial orders of instruction\nfor the king of the country of Siam as follows:\n\u2018I rule all under Heaven and look on all equally. You have\nbeen able to respect the Court and have repeatedly sent\nenvoys to come to Court and offer tribute. I am pleased with\nyour service. However, recently, it has been heard that the\nking of the country of Melaka wanted to personally come to\nCourt, but was obstructed by you. In my opinion, this certainly\ncannot have been your will, king. Rather, it must have been\nsome of your attendants, who are unable to think deeply\nabout things, who have obstructed avenues and started strife\nwith neighboring states. How can such actions be a way to\nlong maintain prosperity? You, king should respect my orders,\ndevelop good relations with your neighbors, examine and\ninstruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or\naggressively. Then it will be seen that you are able to respect\nHeaven and serve the superior, protect the country and the\npeople\u2019s peace and maintain good relations with neighboring\nstates. This will accord with my will of looking on all equally.\u2019\nThe Ministry of Rites said:\n\u2018There are precedents for conferring rewards on tribute\nenvoys from the various fan. However, Wubaochina did not\nbring any tribute and there is no precedent on which to base\nrewards.\u2019\nThe Emperor said:\n\u2018This distant person has come tens of thousands of li from\nabroad to complain of injustice. How can we not reward him!\u2019\nAccordingly, ramie-silk clothing, biao-li of variegated silks,\nsilks and cotton cloth were conferred upon him in the same\nquantities as those conferred upon tribute envoys from other\ncountries.\nXuande: Year 6, Month 2, Day 7 (20 Mar 1431) 50 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSource: Geoff Wade, translator, Southeast Asia in the Ming\nShi-lu: An Open Access Resource, Singapore: Asia Research\nInstitute and the Singapore E-Press, National University of\nSingapore, http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/person/zheng-he,\naccessed July 02, 2018\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Terracotta_Army_Pit_1_-_2 \u00a9 Maros M r a z is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 Liji \u00a9 snowyowls is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Half_Portraits_of_the_Great_Sage_and_Virtuous_Me\nn_of_Old_-_Confucius \u00a9 Anonymous is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Palastexamen-SongDynastie \u00a9 Unknown is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 4079285574_60bc820530_b \u00a9 Ralph Repo is licensed\nunder a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Mongol_Empire_map \u00a9 Astrokey44 is licensed under a\nCC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Marco_Polo,_Il_Milione,_Chapter_CXXIII_and_CXX\nIV \u00a9 Marco Polo is licensed under a Public Domain\nlicense\n\u2022 Hongwu1 \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 8139576703_a585a2d543_b \u00a9 Keith Roper is licensed\nunder a CC BY (Attribution) license Modern World History 51\n\u2022 3668431041_d826f18308_b \u00a9 hassan saeed is licensed\nunder a CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution NonCommercial\nShareAlike) license\n\u2022 361639903_8ff8b7b616_b (1) \u00a9 Lars Plougmann is\nlicensed under a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Voyages_of_Zheng_He \u00a9 Sy is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 The_Great_Wall_of_China_at_Jinshanling-edit \u00a9\nSeverin.stalder is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Verbotene-Stadt1500 \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 1920px-\nThe_Qianlong_Emperor_in_Ceremonial_Armour_on\n_Horseback \u00a9 Giuseppe Castiglione is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 (4)CHINA-SHANDONG-DONGPING-ARCHEOLOGY-\nFRESCOS \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a Public\nDomain license [2]\nEurope and Africa\nThis chapter of our story is bracketed by two population\ndisasters. It begins in the 14th century with the Black Death\nand ends with the American depopulation of the Columbian\nExchange, which we\u2019ll talk about next time.\n52 Modern World History 53\nNations and Empires\nMap of Europe in 1500, showing the major national boundaries.\nOne of the major changes in Europe in the early modern\nperiod, which we take for granted today, is the beginning of a\ntendency toward nations rather than empires. Although some\nEuropean rulers like Napoleon, Queen Victoria, and later Hitler\ntried to expand the scale of their realms into empires, these\nwere exceptions that proved the rule (and Victoria\u2019s British\nEmpire was outside Europe). Europe\u2019s nations were identified\nby factors like ethnicity, language, customs, and religion. Often\nthese nations fought neighbors that were defined by different\nidentities. This made European nations unlike the empires of\nAsia and the near east that typically included wide varieties of\ncultures and ethnicities within their borders.\nThe first, oldest, and largest Asian empire was China, as we\u2019ve\nalready discussed. But there were four additional empires that\nset the scene for the early modern period, and whose histories\nhelped shape the world today. These were the Mughal Empire\nin India, the Safavid Empire in Persia (Iran), the Russian Empire\non Europe\u2019s eastern border, and the Ottoman Empire in the 54 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMiddle East. The Ottomans were a Muslim dynasty that rose on\nthe borders of the Byzantine Empire in the 1300s and became\na world power when Sultan Mehmed II (called Mehmed\nthe Conqueror) overwhelmed the defenders of Constantinople\nin 1453.\nConstantinople had been the capital of the Eastern Roman\nEmpire (also called the Byzantine Empire) since the Emperor\nConstantine had moved his government there in 330 CE. The\ncity was strategically important because it controlled the\nBosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connected the\nMediterranean Sea with the Black Sea. This made it the gateway\nbetween Europe and Asia. Mehmed took the city as his new\ncapital and renamed it Istanbul. The Sultan allowed Christians\nand Jews to continue living in Istanbul and granted the Eastern\nOrthodox Church autonomy as long as they accepted Ottoman\nauthority. But many Christian refugees fled the city and found\ntheir ways to cities like Venice and Florence, where they helped\nignite the period known as the Renaissance.\nIstanbul quickly became the largest Eurasian city outside\nChina. Under Sultans like Suleiman the Magnificent (r.\n1520-1566), the Ottomans expanded into Europe and nearly\ncaptured Vienna in 1529 and again in 1683. They controlled\nshipping in the western Mediterranean and the trade routes\nand major markets connecting to the Silk Road such as Cairo\nand Baghdad. The high cost of doing business in the Ottoman-\ncontrolled Middle East created an incentive for European Modern World History 55\nmerchants to seek other ways of reaching Asia. The Ottomans\nwere actually quite tolerant of ethnic, language, and religious\ndiversity, and their empire was multi-ethnic and multicultural.\nLocal languages, religions, and even self-government were\nallowed as long as people remained loyal to the empire and paid\ntheir taxes.\nIn regions that were too\npoor to pay in money or\nproduce, the Ottomans often\ntook a tax in the form of\npeople. For example, young\nboys were taken as tribute\ncaptives from villages in the\nBalkans. They were converted\nto Islam, educated, and\ntrained into an elite fighting\nforce called the Janissaries\nwho reported directly to the\nEmperor. Because they were\npersonally loyal to one man,\nthe Janissaries became\npolitically powerful. Fear that\nJanissaries in the Battle of Vienna, 1683\nthe private army would\nbetray him and name another heir Sultan caused new rulers to\nassassinate all their brothers as soon as they took the throne.\nThe Janissaries were the Ottomans\u2019 most effective weapon from\n1363 to 1826, when the sultan decided to disband them in favor\nof a modern military. The Janissaries mutinied and marched on\nthe Sultan\u2019s palace, but several thousand were wiped out by\nmodern artillery and the survivors executed.\nThe Ottoman Empire tried to modernize in other ways as\nwell, but fell behind its European neighbors in the nineteenth\ncentury and finally met its end during the First World War. We\u2019ll\nreturn to that story in a few chapters.\nQuestions for Discussion 56 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Why did Istanbul rapidly become the largest city outside\nChina?\n\u2022 Why was it dangerous that the Janissaries reported\npersonally to the Sultan?\nThe Safavid Empire of Persia (1501-1736) was a Shiite Muslim\ndynasty that controlled the region from the eastern border of\nthe Ottoman Empire, through Iran, and into what is now\nAfghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, and Pakistan. The Safavid\u2019s\ngreatest ruler, Shah Abbas the Great, moved his capital to\nIsfahan in central Iran. The ancient Persian city had once been a\nhome for Israelite refugees freed from the Babylonian Captivity\nby Cyrus the Great in the 6thcentury BCE. Shah Abbas\ncontinued the tradition of settling refugees in Isfahan,\nwelcoming hundreds of thousands of Armenians in the early\n1600s from the disputed border region separating the Shiite\nSafavid Empire from the Sunni Ottoman Empire. After the\nArmenian genocide in 1915, during World War One, the\nArmenian quarter of Isfahan became one of the oldest and\nlargest Armenian centers in the world. Modern World History 57\nThe maximum extent of the Safavid Empire under Shah Abbas\nThe Mughal Empire of India was established in 1526 by a\nPersian-speaking dynasty that traced its authority back to\nGenghis Khan\u2019s second son, Chagatai. The empire formed in a\nregion that had been conquered by Tamerlane, a Mongol leader\nwho consolidated the remains of several khanates. Tamerlane\nwanted to reassemble Genghis\u2019s Mongol Empire, and he also\nconsidered himself \u201cthe Sword of Islam.\u201d He died in 1405 on his\nway to a planned invasion of Ming China which his successor\nimmediately called off.\nInspired by Tamerlane\u2019s fusion of cultures and religious\nmovements, a new religion called Sikhism developed in the\nPunjab in the 15th century by combining elements of the\ntraditional Hinduism of the region with Islam. Sikhs opposed\nIndia\u2019s caste system, while becoming legendary warriors on the\nsub-continent.\nThe Mughals (from whom we get the term mogul) ruled a\nwealthy empire that included most of the Indian subcontinent\nand large parts of Afghanistan. It lasted until 1857 and at its peak\nruled a population of over 150 million people. 58 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Mughal golden age began\nin 1556 with the reign of\nAkbar the Great, who\nexpanded the empire\u2019s\nterritory but allowed his\nIndian subjects to keep their\nlanguages and religions.\nHinduism, which is still the\ndominant religion of India, is The Taj Mahal\nbased on ancient traditions\nand practices originating centuries before the development of\nJudaism and other religions in the Middle East. It is a\npolytheistic religion in which the stories of the relations among\nthe gods and goddesses help explain the human condition.\nUnlike Muslims and Christians, differences related to religious\npractice have rarely divided Hindus.\nAkbar\u2019s grandson Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658) was also an\naccomplished military leader, but his reign is remembered for\nits architectural achievements. Among them is the Taj Mahal,\nbuilt as a tomb for Jahan\u2019s favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal.\nThe Russian Empire grew out of resistance to Mongol rule\nand the fall of Constantinople. A ruler of the Grand Duchy of\nMoscow named Ivan III (later called Ivan the Great) refused to\npay tribute to the Golden Horde and after the death of the last\nGreek Orthodox Christian emperor, Ivan decided his kingdom\nwould become the new Rome. Ivan (r. 1462-1505) tripled the size\nof his state and rebuilt the Kremlin in Moscow. His grandson,\nIvan IV (Ivan the Terrible, r. 1547-1584) was the first to declare\nhimself Tsar of all the Russias\u2014a title which is Russian for\n\u201cCaesar.\u201d He annexed the khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and\nSiberia and recruited Cossacks from southern Russia and\nUkraine to colonize Siberia.\nRussia became the largest kingdom in the world, stretching\nfrom the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean, but much of it was\nunoccupied and primitive. Peter I (Peter the Great, r. 1672-1725)\nvisited Europe in disguise for 18 months to study shipbuilding\nand new administrative techniques that he used to modernize\nhis realm and establish the Russian Empire. We\u2019ll return to Modern World History 59\nRussia later, but let\u2019s explore some of the things that attracted\nPeter to Europe in the late 1600s.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were the Ottomans and the Safavids always at war?\n\u2022 What was the advantage for empires like the Mughal of letting\nsubject peoples retain their languages, religions, and\ncustoms?\n\u2022 What attracted Peter the Great to study Europe?\nThe Enlightenment and Protestant Reformation\nMap of the spread of bubonic plague in Europe\nEurope\u2019s Dark Ages ended in the 15thcentury, after the disaster 60 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nof the Black Death. Even before the bubonic plague arrived,\nharsh winters and rainy summers beginning around 1310 had\ncaused widespread famine. Feudal lords squeezed their peasants\nfor crops and labor, and states raised taxes. Several million died\nduring the famine, and then two thirds of Europe\u2019s population\ndisappeared between the plague\u2019s arrival in 1347 and 1353. This\ndepopulation threatened the power of the Church and the\nnobility, as surviving peasants became less patient with the taxes\nand labor demands of their bishops and lords. Peasant revolts\nin France and England in the second half of the 14th century\nshowed the feudal system of the Middle Ages was coming to an\nend.\nUnlike the new eastern Muslim empires and the continuing\nChinese Empire, Europe was unable to reunify under a single\nleader and create its own empire\u2014although Austria\u2019s Hapsburg\ndynasty did its best to lead an alliance optimistically named\nthe Holy Roman Empire for centuries. Too many languages\nand local centers of power competed for dominance, and the\nCatholic Church (Europe\u2019s largest landowner) was unable to\nexercise secular as well as spiritual power. Instead the church\nfound itself pulled into regional contests for power, and in 1309\na French-born Pope moved his residence to Avignon. Seven\npopes resided in France under the control of the French king\nuntil 1378, when another French-born Pope decided to move\nback to Rome. But the French rulers and a growing class of\naristocratic French cardinals were unwilling to give up the\npower that came with having their own Pope. For another sixty\nyears there were two competing Papal Courts, one in Rome and\na rival in Avignon. Although the Avignon Popes have been called\nAnti-Popes, it\u2019s important to understand that the conflict was\nprimarily about political power rather than about theology or\nreligious doctrine. But theological conflicts were right around\nthe corner. Modern World History 61\nPapal Palace in Avignon, France\nThe arrival of the printing\npress in Europe in the middle\nof the fifteenth century\nallowed critics of the church\nlike the friar Martin Luther to\npublish books and pamphlets\ncalling for reform. Printing\nwas a Chinese invention that\nGutenberg\u2019s first complete book was\nwas improved by Johannes\nprobably this Bible. He printed about 180\nGutenberg, a German copies of it in 1455.\ngoldsmith who understood\nthat moveable type was much more useful for an alphabet-\nbased language than for a character-based system like Chinese.\nPrinting spread classical Greek and Roman texts that had been\ncarried to Europe by refugees from Constantinople, helping\nignite the Renaissance (literally \u201crebirth\u201d) of Europe. A new\nphilosophy called Humanism focused scholars on learning that\nwas not contained in Scripture or in church-approved sources,\nand on skepticism toward the decrees of religious authorities.\nSome Renaissance geniuses like Leonardo da Vinci and\nMichelangelo did not directly challenge the claims of political\nand religious authorities. Others like Machiavelli and Galileo\ndid. The encounter with the Americas (the topic of the next\nchapter) also upset a traditional understanding of the world\u2019s\norigin and history that did not account for the existence of these\ncontinents. And religious reformers like Martin Luther used the 62 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nability to print books to radically change the way Europeans\nthought about their Christianity and the Catholic Church.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Do you think the existence of the Church in Europe was a\nsignificant factor in preventing an empire from forming?\n\u2022 How did the spread of new knowledge encourage humanism\nand skepticism?\nMartin Luther (1483-1546)\nwas an Augustinian monk\nwho began the Protestant\nReformation as a reaction\nagainst what he perceived as a\nbetrayal of Christian ideals by\nthe wealthy and self-\nindulgent Catholic Church.\nThe Church had long gone\nthrough cycles of corruption\nand reform, which was\nusually led by new religious\norders of monks (such as the\nFranciscans and Dominicans\nin the early 13th century).\nAmong Among Luther\u2019s\nradical ideas was that the\nA portrait of Martin Luther as an Catholic Church and the\nAugistinian monk, before his break from\nPapacy were so corrupt and\nthe Catholic Church\nfar away from the teachings\nof Jesus that Christianity needed to be reestablished, rather than\nreformed.\nLuther received a Doctorate in Theology in 1512 and joined\nthe faculty of the University of Wittenberg in Germany. In 1516\nthe Catholic Church began selling indulgences to raise money\nfor the construction of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome. Indulgences Modern World History 63\nwere basically tickets for \u201ctime off\u201d in purgatory (the place souls\nwent to purify before entering heaven), and Luther objected\non theological grounds; he also criticized the wealthy Pope for\ntaxing the poor to build an unnecessary Vatican monument he\ncould easily afford himself. Luther did not intend to split from\nthe Catholic Church, but after his 95 Theseswere translated\nfrom Latin to German, his criticism of the church and his new\napproach to theology caught on.\nLuther was tried for heresy (no laughing matter: Czech\nreligious reformer Jan Hus had been burned at the stake in 1415)\nand was excommunicated in 1521. The church banned Luther\u2019s\nbooks, but Luther was a prolific writer who went on to publish\nscores of works using the new printing press condemning the\nRoman church. Luther translated the Bible into German and\nwrote a hymnal, so Germans could worship in their own\nlanguage and understand what they were saying at\nchurch\u2014Latin was still the official language of the Catholic\nChurch (and would remain so until 1965).\nPrinting presses and expanding European literacy helped\naccelerate the Reformation. 64 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMany members of the\nnobility, particularly in\nnorthern Germany and\nScandinavia, embraced\nLuther\u2019s ideas not only for\ntheological reasons but also\nfor political reasons: they\nwould no longer need to pay\ntribute and pledge to submit\ntheir authority to the Pope in\nRome. The Reformation was\nnot the only challenge that\nalarmed religious authorities\ninto reacting with\npersecution. When Galileo\nused a telescope to prove\nCopernicus\u2019s new theories\nthat extended understanding\nof planetary motion beyond\nGalileo\u2019s middle finger, preserved in the\nthe second-century theories\nscience museum of Florence, Italy\nof Ptolemy, it was not the\nancient Greeks who put him under house arrest for the rest of\nhis life and nearly burned him as a heretic, but the Catholic\nChurch\u2014Copernicus and Galileo were rejecting a human-\ncentered world founded by God Himself. Galileo\u2019s challenge to\nthe Church\u2019s outdated description of the natural world was the\nfirst of many disputes that science has had (and continues to\nhave) with religious authority.\nTo be fair, though, the idea that new data should challenge\ncenturies of intellectual and theological tradition was as radical\nas the idea that the Earth orbits around the Sun and not vice\nversa. The Church, and European society in general, sought to\nhave eternal and unchanging answers for social and personal\nconditions. Although today we are accustomed to the idea that\nnew information that can reorganize the ways we understand\nthe world is always becoming available, this was not part of\nthe early modern worldview\u2014which makes Galileo and Luther\nsuch radical figures in European and Western history.\nAs challenges became more frequent, some people tried to Modern World History 65\nresist them by force. The Inquisition and persecution of witches\nflourished because authorities felt threatened. And the doctrine\nof papal infallibility did not even exist until the First Vatican\nCouncil in 1868 when science had gained a pretty substantial\nlead over faith\u2026something to think about, since it implies that\nthe Catholic Church never seemed to need to declare\ninfallibility until it was challenged (curiously, the Papacy has\nonly used that authority once, in 1950 in relation to doctrines\nconcerning Mary, the mother of Jesus).\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Was Luther justified in criticizing Church leaders in the\nVatican?\n\u2022 What other motivations did people have for rejecting Roman\nauthority, beyond theological differences?\n\u2022 Was the Church\u2019s reaction to the challenges of new doctrines\nand new information about he world appropriate?\nThe development of\nscience in Europe during the\nRenaissance would not have\nbeen possible without the\ncontributions made by\nMuslim scholars. During the\nperiod when Europe was\nsuffering an intellectual \u201cDark\nAge\u201d in the centuries\nfollowing the fall of Rome,\nthe embrace of Islam in\nNorth Africa, the Middle East,\n13th century illustration depicting scholars and beyond created stability\nin a public library in Baghdad\nthat encouraged the\nestablishment of trade routes to China, which was accompanied\nby an exchange of ideas and technology. While medieval monks\nin Europe were busy copying illuminated Latin Bibles and 66 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nhymnals, scholars like Al-Khwarizmi (780-850) the inventor of\nalgebra, Al-Kindi (801-873) philosopher and musician Al-\nZahrawi (936-1013) the father of surgery, Ibn Al-Haytham\n(965-1040) physicist and father of optics), Al-Biruni (973-1050),\nhistorian and scientist, Ibn Sina (980-1037) astronomer and\nphysician, and Ibn Rushd (1126-1198) philosopher and scientist,\nnot only preserved classical Greek philosophy and science that\nwas lost in Europe but made important original contributions\nto knowledge and culture. Arab mathematicians were also\nimpressed with the Indian number system, which included the\nconcept of zero\u2014in the 1200s, western Europeans began to\nchange from Roman numerals (which did not have a zero) to\nArabic numerals. There would be no computers without this\nrevolutionary change in mathematics\u2026try dividing using\nRoman numerals. Arab scholars helped trigger the Renaissance\nwhich led to both the European Enlightenment and the\nIndustrial Revolution that produced the modern world we live\nin today.\nIn most of their kingdoms and caliphates, Muslim sovereigns\nrespected Jews and Christians as \u201cpeople of the book.\u201d This\nwas especially important in the Iberian Peninsula\u2014present-day\nPortugal and Spain\u2014parts of which were dominated by Muslim\nrulers from 711 to 1492. The introduction of ideas in astronomy,\nnavigation, and mathematics in Iberia soon spread to other\nparts of Europe. In 1492, Christopher Columbus was able to sail\nto the New World partly because of Arab naval and navigation\ntechnology.\nThe European philosophers and scientists who led the\nEnlightenment were dominated by Isaac Newton (1643-1727),\nwho co-invented calculus and produced the first unified theory\nof nature. Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica (first published in\n1687) created a foundation for all the physics and engineering\nthat followed it, and his theories were basically undisputed until\nEinstein and quantum physics took up the challenge of\ndescribing the universe at the macroscopic and microscopic\nlevels in the early 20th century. Other important\nEnlightenment thinkers included \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, a French\naristocrat who studied and translated both Newton and his chief\nrival, German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Modern World History 67\nLeibniz was the other inventor of Calculus, and the version we\nnow use is actually based a little bit more on his notation system\nthan on Newton\u2019s. These scholars and their colleagues described\ntheir field as \u201cnatural science\u201d and they tried to find natural\nlaws for society, politics, and the economy to parallel Newton\u2019s\ndiscoveries of gravity and optics. John Locke, Adam Smith, and\nVoltaire formulated ideas about natural rights and society that\nepitomized what English speakers called Enlightenment and\nwhat Germans like philosopher Immanuel Kant called\naufkl\u00e4rung (literally, a \u201cclearing up\u201d). Kant famously explained\nthat his aufkl\u00e4rung was humanity\u2019s emergence from its self-\nimposed adolescence.\nThe Prague Orloj, or Astronomical Clock, dates back to 1410.\nOne of the consequences of Newton\u2019s physics and other\nEnlightenment ideas was a crisis in religion. Although Newton\nhimself seems to have believed in a God of some type, the\nuniverse he described in his theories did not require a personal\ndeity to be actively engaged in making things happen. Newton\u2019s\nuniverse seemed more like one of the new mechanical clocks 68 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthat were just becoming popular. These complex machines\nmight require a mechanical engineer or a watchmaker to design\nand build them, but once made and wound they could be left\nto themselves. Absorbing this watchmaker metaphor, many\nEnlightenment thinkers rejected the popular religious vision of\nan activist God who was involved in the day-to-day operation\nof the world, who rewarded the righteous and punished sinners,\nor who chose sides in history. The Protestant idea of\npredestination suggested that there was no free will, and that\nfrom God\u2019s perspective time and chance did not really\nexist\u2014Newton and other European scientists challenged that\nnotion. Many also began to doubt traditional stories of the\ndeity\u2019s interference in history, including the Christian story of\nJesus.\nFor example, Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote an\nessay on miracles in 1748 that was widely influential and is still\na required text for philosophy students. Hume did not argue\nthat miracles could not happen, but that people who believed\nin miracles were usually not talking about events they had\nwitnessed themselves, but only retelling stories of miracles they\nhad heard or read about (for instance, in the Christian Bible).\nFor Hume, the issue that divided religious believers from\nskeptics was not actually miracles, but testimony about miracles\nreported to have happened years, decades, or even centuries\nago.\nIn contrast, Hume argued, laws of nature could be deduced\nright now because they continued to operate and their effects\ncould be seen every day. Hume left this essay out of the first\nedition of his book, An Enquiry into Human Understanding, to\navoid antagonizing the faithful. But it found its way into print\nand remains an important challenge to traditions that seek to\nassert their authority based on supernatural claims.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did Muslim scholars contribute to building the modern\nworld? Modern World History 69\n\u2022 Do you think the term Enlightenment (or aufkl\u00e4rung) is an\naccurate description of the change in our understanding of\nthe world produced by the new \u201cnatural science\u201d?\n\u2022 Were philosophers such as David Hume justified in\nsuggesting that supernatural claims were problematic?\nEuropean intellectuals also\nconsidered economic\nquestions. Capitalism, the\nidea that invested wealth can\nbe an engine for economic,\nsocial, and technological\ndevelopment, was most\nfamously explained by the\nEnglish philosopher Adam\nThe old Town Hall where the Bank of Smith. An agricultural\nAmsterdam was founded in 1609 revolution contributed to\nincreased crop production\nand population growth in the 1400s, and that led to a surplus\npopulation being able to gather in towns and cities to engage in\nartisanal activities\u2014metropolises which were once mainly\ncenters of commerce and government and Church\nadministration, began to produce goods for trade as well. Even\nbefore the development of mechanized textile factories in\nGreat Britain, for example, weavers lived and worked in districts\nlike East London for generations. People began to specialize in\nparticular trades, making products for customers beyond their\nown families and neighborhoods. Some general-purpose\ncraftsmen like blacksmiths became increasingly specialized,\nfocusing on manufacturing products with broader, mass\nmarkets (for example guns or carriage-springs, rather than just\nhorseshoes, nails, hinges, and whatever the locals needed from\nday to day).\nBanks in Europe began forming financial networks that\nstandardized prices across larger regions, such as in Italy, the\nLow Countries and along the Baltic coast. When transportation 70 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nand communication are poor, there are many opportunities\nfor arbitrage: buying products cheap where they are abundant\nand then selling them for a profit where they are scarce. As\nnetworks improved, these opportunities decreased \u2013 or at least\nwere pushed farther away.\nPolitics and finance were connected at this time: capitalism\ndid not develop in a vacuum. Although Adam Smith famously\ndescribed the \u201cInvisible Hand\u201d of market forces in 1776,\nmerchants were heavily involved in government in England\nand Europe, influencing their nations\u2019 policies and regulations\nto favor their own goals. Also, as described in later chapters,\nimperial expansion and colonial armies were indispensable for\nthe spread of capitalism throughout the world.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Is it significant that the stories we tell about the capitalist\nsystem focus on the \u201cInvisible Hand\u201d and stress freedom, in\nspite of the close ties between business and government\npower? Modern World History 71\nThe RReeccoonnqquuiissttaa and Portuguese Trade with Africa\nDepiction of the Muslim surrender of Granada to Ferdinand and Isabella, ending the\nReconquista\nIn the next chapter, we will turn to the Americas and their\ndiscovery by Europeans. The backstory for this discovery and\ncolonization is the Reconquista, a centuries-long effort by the\nPortuguese and Spanish to push the Muslim Moors back to\nAfrica. Muslims had taken over most of the Iberian Peninsula\nbeginning in 711. The Reconquista begun by Christian nobles in\nnorthern Spain took about 800 years to complete.\nThe Portuguese Christians \u201creconquered\u201d more quickly,\nbecause Portugal does not extend as far into the south and the\nSpanish kings and princes had to contend with the fortified\ncities of Seville and Granada. However, Portugal also captured\nCeuta, a Moroccan fortress in North Africa in 1415, which gave\nthem control over the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic.\nAfter a brief but successful war with Castile, the principle\nkingdom in central Spain, Portugal turned its attention to\nexploring and acquiring territory along the coast of Africa in\nthe 1430s and 1440s under the direction of Prince Henry the\nNavigator (Henry\u2019s older brother Edward became King when\ntheir father died of the plague). The Portuguese were becoming 72 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmerchants and traders while the Christian Spanish were still\nfighting Muslims.\nPortuguese mariners, following the route established by\nBartolomeu Dias and Vasco de Gama in 1488 and 1497, began\nsailing to Asia around southern Africa. They conquered coastal\neast African city-states, established colonies in Angola and\nMozambique, and took advantage of a slave-trading network\nthat provided possibly 10 million captives for Muslim slave\nauctions from the 9th century to the twentieth. Portuguese\ncontrol of the African coast was one of the reasons the royal\ncourt in Lisbon showed little interest in Columbus\u2019s proposal to\nsail west across the Atlantic to India; it is also why the Spanish\nwere eager to take Columbus up on his plan in search of a route\nto Asia. We will return to Spain\u2019s interest in Columbus in the\nnext chapter.\nPortuguese discoveries and explorations: first arrival places and dates, and main\nPortuguese spice trade routes in the Indian Ocean.\nAs mentioned above, in the wake of the Black Death peasants\nand artisans demanded and received better pay, leading to\nincreased commercial activity in Europe in the late 1300s which\nincluded not only the important Mediterranean trade\ndominated by Italian merchants, but also in the Baltic and\nacross the English Channel. However, economic expansion was\nlimited by the availability of gold and silver coins, which had\nbeen used in exchange since the sixth century BCE in Greece\nand Persia.\nPortuguese merchants were interested in developing a route\naround Africa to Asia for the trade in spice and silks, but they Modern World History 73\nwere pleased to find trade in sub-Saharan Africa as well. The\nstory of the enormous gold reserves of Mansa Musa, Muslim\nruler of Mali, were well known to Europeans, especially after\nhe spent enormous amounts of gold in the Middle East during\nhis pilgrimage to Mecca in the 1327. The Portuguese enquired\nabout the availability of gold in every contact that they made\nin their explorations, and were not disappointed. Present-day\nGhana in West Africa was known as the \u201cgold coast\u201d by\nEuropean traders and imperialists until its independence in\n1957, and is still second only to South Africa in gold production\non the continent.\nDetail from the Catalan Atlas of 1375 showing Mansa Musa sitting on a throne and\nholding a gold coin\nAfrican gold certainly aided in economic exchange in Europe,\nbut it was not enough. As we will see in the next chapter, the\nsearch for gold was an important motivation for the\nexploration, conquest, and colonization of the Americas by the\nSpanish and Portuguese.\nQuestions for Discussion 74 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Why did Portugal complete its Reconquista earlier than Spain?\n\u2022 How did a lack of gold and silver slow economic growth in\nEurope?\nThe African Slave Trade\nAs in most world societies in the 1400s, the institution of slavery\nwas a traditional element in African kingdoms and chiefdoms.\nCaptives were usually acquired through war or as for payment\nof debts, and enslaved for a period of time or even for life.\nHowever, enslaved captives often gained positions in the\nsocieties that had captured them, and their children were\ngenerally born free. African traders were willing to include this\nhuman cargo in commerce with the Portuguese and other\nEuropeans, who readily accepted them as enslaved laborers and\ndomestic servants.\nThe trade of enslaved people, especially from eastern Europe,\nhad been important in many parts of that continent even into\nthe 1400s. We have seen that in the Ottoman Empire, the\nJanissaries were eastern European captives who were trained as\nan elite military corps. The thriving economies of all of the\nIslamic empires, from Spain through Persia, also created a\ndemand for enslaved people from Europe. The Vikings of\nnorthern Europe sold captives from Britain to the Middle East,\nas did the Frankish kings of western and central Europe, who\nenslaved prisoners-of-war from among the Slavic peoples of\neastern Europe (as had the Romans before them). Although the\ndemand for enslaved labor was less in Europe than in the more\neconomically-developed Muslim world, some European slaves\ncertainly served owners in the fiefdoms of the western Europe.\nThe human cargo brought to Europe from Africa by the\nPortuguese in the 1400s, however, became much more highly\nfavored than that of eastern Europe: not only were dark-skinned\npeople more exotic for service in the royal courts, they also\ncould not escape by simply blending in with the local\npopulation. One can easily imagine how this would lead to ideas Modern World History 75\nof superior and inferior races\u2014within a few generations, slave-\nowning \u201cwhites\u201d would consider \u201cblacks\u201d to be only suited for\nenslavement.\nHowever, what made the African slave trade so lucrative by\nthe 1500s and into the beginning of the 1800s was not the\ndemand for labor in Europe, but rather on sugar plantations on\nthe islands of the Atlantic and later in Brazil and the Caribbean.\nThe vast majority of the enslaved from Africa were used as\nforced labor in the back-breaking cultivation and processing of\nsugar cane. Portuguese trade with sub-Saharan Africa coincided\nwith the discovery that sugar cane grew well on the eastern\nAtlantic islands off the African coast controlled by the\nPortuguese and Spanish in the 1400s.\nA Portuguese sugar mill, worked by African slaves, 1648\nSugar cane itself was first developed in the archipelagos of\nSoutheast Asia. Arab traders brought the plant to the Middle\nEast, where Europeans discovered sugar during the crusades\nand developed a taste for it through their commerce in the\nregion. Sugar was at first considered an exotic medicinal, but\nonce the Portuguese and Spanish began cultivating cane on the\nMadeiras and Canary Islands, a European addiction to sugar\nsoon began\u2014replacing honey as the region\u2019s main sweetener.\nEventually, more than two thirds of all enslaved Africans in\nthe Western Hemisphere were involved in cultivating,\nharvesting, and processing sugar cane in Brazil and the\nCaribbean. Sugar was such a lucrative cash crop for plantation 76 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nowners, that they would import enslaved Africans, work them to\ndeath in three to five years, and bring in more. We will examine\nthis history in a later chapter.\nThe Portuguese established the first European colony in sub-\nSaharan Africa, which they called Angola, in 1575, south of the\npowerful Kongo kingdom on the West African coast. The\nKongolese royal family had converted to Christianity and the\nruler, Afonso I, tried to negotiate as a peer with the rulers of\nPortugal. King Afonso was not able to prevent Portuguese slave\ntraders from indiscriminately taking people with high social\nstatus in his kingdom as slaves. Generally only criminals and\nwar captives were sold to foreign slavers, not the sons of\nnoblemen and the king\u2019s relatives. It is unclear whether King\nAfonso tried to ban all trade in slaves, or whether he\ncompromised to avoid antagonizing his European allies. Either\nway, his ban was ineffective and the Portuguese carried off more\nand more slaves to their sugar plantations in Brazil.\nOccasionally the Iberians tried to claim that they were doing\nthe Africans a favor by Christianizing them. But conditions on\nsugar plantations were so harsh that slaves typically only\nsurvived a few years. So their conversions were not so much to\nprepare them for a life as Christians, but to save their souls when\nthey perished from overwork and malnutrition. Over the next\nseveral centuries, nearly six times more Africans were forcibly\nsent to the Americas than Europeans who went willingly. In\nall, about 16 million Africans were shipped to the Americas\nin chains. About 4 million died on the way and were thrown\noverboard into the Atlantic.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How was the slave trade practiced by the Portuguese\ndifferent than earlier types of unfree labor?\n\u2022 How significant was the European interest in sugar to the\ngrowth of slavery in the Atlantic world? Modern World History 77\nPrimary Source Supplement #1: King Afonso I of the\nKongo\u2019s letters to Jo\u00e3o, King of Portugal\nSir, Your Highness should know how our kingdom is being\nlost in so many ways that it is convenient to provide for the\nnecessary remedy, since this is caused by the excessive\nfreedom given by your agents and officials to the men and\nmerchants who are allowed to come to this kingdom to set\nup shops with goods and many things which have been\nprohibited by us, and which they spread throughout our\nkingdoms and domains in such an abundance that many of\nour vassals, whom we had in obedience, do not comply\nbecause they have the things in greater abundance than we\nourselves; and it was with these things that we had them\ncontent and subjected under our vassalage and jurisdiction,\nso it is doing a great harm not only to the service of God, but\nthe security and peace of our kingdoms and state as well.\nAnd we cannot reckon how great the damage is, since the\nmentioned merchants are taking every day our natives, sons\nof the land and the sons of our noblemen and vassals and\nour relatives, because the thieves and men of bad conscience\ngrab them wishing to have the things and wares of this\nkingdom which they are ambitious of; they grab them and\nget them to be sold; and so great, Sir, is the corruption and\nlicentiousness that our country is being completely\ndepopulated, and Your Highness should not agree with this\nnor accept it as in your service. And to avoid it we need from\nthose your kingdoms no more than some priests and a few\npeople to reach in schools, and no other goods except wine\nand flour for the holy sacrament. That is why we beg of Your\nHighness to help and assist us in this matter, commanding\nyour factors that they should not send here either merchants\nor wares, because it is our will that in these kingdoms there\nshould not be any trade of slaves nor outlet for them.\nConcerning what is referred above, again we beg of Your\nHighness to agree with it, since otherwise we cannot remedy\nsuch an obvious damage. Pray Our Lord in His mercy to have\nYour Highness under His guard and let you do forever the\nthings of His service. I kiss your hands many times.\n(dated July 6, 1526) 78 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMoreover, Sir, in our kingdoms there is another great\ninconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that\nmany of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares\nand things of your kingdoms, which are brought here by your\npeople, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize\nmany of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often\nit happens that they kidnap even noblemen and the sons of\nnoblemen, and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the\nwhite men who are in our kingdoms; and for this purpose\nthey have concealed them; and others are brought during the\nnight so that they might not be recognized.\nAnd as soon as they are taken by the white men they are\nimmediately ironed and branded with fire, and when they are\ncarried to be embarked, if they are caught by our guards\u2019 men\nthe whites allege that they have bought them but they cannot\nsay from whom, so that it is our duty to do justice and to\nrestore to the freemen their freedom, but it cannot be done if\nyour subjects feel offended, as they claim to be.\nAnd to avoid such a great evil we passed a law so that any\nwhite man living in our kingdoms and wanting to purchase\ngoods in any way should first inform three of our noblemen\nand officials of our court whom we rely upon in this\nmatter\u2026who should investigate if the mentioned goods are\ncaptives or free men, and if cleared by them there will be\nno further doubt nor embargo for them to be taken and\nembarked. But if the white men do not comply with it they will\nlose the aforementioned goods. And if we do them this favor\nand concession it is for the part Your Highness has in it, since\nwe know that it is in your service too that these goods are\ntaken from our kingdom, otherwise we should not consent to\nthis. . . .\nSir, Your Highness has been kind enough to write to us\nsaying that we should ask in our letters for anything we need,\nand that we shall be provided with everything, and as the\npeace and the health of your kingdom depend on us, and\nas there are among us old folks and people who have lived\nfor many days, it happens we have continuously many and\ndifferent diseases which put us very often in such a weakness\nthat we reach almost the last extreme; and the same happens\nto Our children, relatives and natives owing to the lack in Modern World History 79\nthis country of physicians and surgeons who might know how\nto cure properly such diseases. And us we have got neither\ndispensaries nor drugs which might help us in this\nforlornness, many of those who had been already confirmed\nand instructed in the holy faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ perish\nand die; and the rest of the people in their majority cure\nthemselves with herbs and breads and other ancient\nmethods, so that they put all their faith in the mentioned\nherbs and ceremonies if they live, and believe that they are\nsaved if they die; and this is not much in the service of God.\nAnd to avoid such a great error and inconvenience, since it\nis from God in the first place and then from your kingdoms\nand from Your Highness that all the good and drugs and\nmedicines have come to save us, we beg of you to be\nagreeable and kind enough to send us two physicians and\ntwo apothecaries and one surgeon, so that they may come\nwith all the necessary things to stay in our kingdoms, because\nwe are in extreme need of them. We shall do them all good\nand shall benefit them by all means, since they are sent by\nYour Highness, whom we thank for your work in their coming.\nWe beg of Your Highness as a great favor to do this for us,\nbecause besides being good in itself it is in the service of God\nas we have said above.\n(dated October 18, 1526)\nPrimary Source Supplement #2: Excerpts from Luther\u2019s\nAAddddrreessss ttoo tthhee CChhrriissttiiaann NNoobbiilliittyy ooff tthhee GGeerrmmaann NNaattiioonn, 1520.\nThe Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three\nwalls round themselves, with which they have hitherto\nprotected themselves, so that no one could reform them,\nwhereby all Christendom has suffered terribly.\nFirst, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed\nand maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction 80 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nover them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is\nabove the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the\nScriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the\nScriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they invented\nthe notion that no one may call a council but the Pope.\nThus they have privily stolen from us our three sticks, so\nthat they may not be beaten. And they have dug themselves\nin securely behind their three walls, so that they can carry on\nall the knavish tricks which we now observe. . .\nNow may God help us, and give us one of those trumpets\nthat overthrew the walls of Jericho, so that we may blow down\nthese walls of straw and paper, and that we may have a\nchance to use Christian rods for the chastisement of sin, and\nexpose the craft and deceit of the devil; thus we may amend\nourselves by punishment and again obtain God\u2019s favor.\nLet us, in the first place, attack the first wall.\nThere has been a fiction by which the Pope, bishops,\npriests, and monks are called the \u2018spiritual estate\u2019; princes,\nlords, artisans, and peasants are the \u2018temporal estate.\u2019 This is\nan artful lie and hypocritical invention, but let no one be made\nafraid by it, and that for this reason: that all Christians are\ntruly of the spiritual estate, and there is no difference among\nthem, save of office. As St Paul says (I Cor. xii), we are all one\nbody, though each member does its own work so as to serve\nthe others. This is because we have one baptism, one Gospel,\none faith, and are all Christians alike; for baptism, Gospel, and\nfaith, these alone make spiritual and Christian people.\nAs for the unction by a pope or a bishop, tonsure,\nordination, consecration, and clothes differing from those of\nlaymen\u2013all this may make a hypocrite or an anointed puppet,\nbut never a Christian or a spiritual man. Thus we are all\nconsecrated as priests by baptism, as St Peter says: \u2018Ye are a\nroyal priesthood, a holy nation\u2019 (I Pet. ii. 9); and in the Book\nof Revelation: \u2018and hast made us unto our God (by Thy blood)\nkings and priests\u2019 (Rev. v. 10). For, if we had not a higher\nconsecration in us than pope or bishop can give, no priest Modern World History 81\ncould ever be made by the consecration of pope or bishop,\nnor could he say the mass or preach or absolve. Therefore the\nbishop\u2019s consecration is just as if in the name of the whole\ncongregation he took one person out of the community, each\nmember of which has equal power, and commanded him to\nexercise this power for the rest; just as if ten brothers, co-\nheirs as king\u2019s sons, were to choose one from among them to\nrule over their inheritance, they would all of them still remain\nkings and have equal power, although one is appointed to\ngovern.\nAnd to put the matter more plainly, if a little company of\npious Christian laymen were taken prisoners and carried\naway to a desert, and had not among them a priest\nconsecrated by a bishop, and were there to agree to elect one\nof them \u2026 and were to order him to baptize, to celebrate the\nmass, to absolve and to preach, this man would as truly be a\npriest, as if all the bishops and all the popes had consecrated\nhim. That is why, in cases of necessity, every man can baptize\nand absolve, which would not be possible if we were not all\npriests. This great grace and virtue of baptism and of the\nChristian estate they have annulled and made us forget by\ntheir ecclesiastical law . . .\nSince then the \u2018temporal power\u2019 is as much baptized as\nwe, and has the same faith and Gospel, we must allow it\nto be a priest and bishop, and account its office an office\nthat is proper and useful to the Christian community. For\nwhatever has undergone baptism may boast that it has been\nconsecrated priest, bishop, and pope, although it does not\nbeseem every one to exercise these offices. For, since we are\nall priests alike, no man may put himself forward, or take\nupon himself without our consent and election, to do that\nwhich we have all alike power to do. For if a thing is common\nto all, no man may take it to himself without the wish and\ncommand of the community. And if it should happen that a\nman were appointed to one of these offices and deposed for\nabuses, he would be just what he was before. Therefore a\npriest should be nothing in Christendom but a functionary;\nas long as he holds his office, he has precedence; if he is\ndeprived of it, he is a peasant or a citizen like the rest.\nTherefore a priest is verily no longer a priest after deposition. 82 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBut now they have invented characteres indelibiles, and\npretend that a priest after deprivation still differs from a mere\nlayman. They even imagine that a priest can never be\nanything but a priest\u2013that is, he can never become a layman.\nAll this is nothing but mere talk and a figment of human\ninvention.\nIt follows, then, that between laymen and priests, princes\nand bishops, or, as they call it, between \u2018spiritual\u2019 and\n\u2018temporal\u2019 persons, the only real difference is one of office\nand function, and not of estate . . .\nBut what kind of Christian doctrine is this, that the\n\u2018temporal power\u2019 is not above the \u2018spiritual,\u2019 and therefore\ncannot punish it! As if the hand should not help the eye,\nhowever much the eye be suffering . . . Nay, the nobler the\nmember the more bound the others are to help it . . .\nTherefore I say, forasmuch as the temporal power has been\nordained by God for the punishment of the bad and the\nprotection of the good, we must let it do its duty throughout\nthe whole Christian body, without respect of persons,\nwhether it strike popes, bishops, priests, monks, nuns, or\nwhoever it may be . . .\nWhatever the ecclesiastical law has said in opposition to\nthis is merely the invention of Romanist arrogance . . .\nNow, I imagine the first paper wall is overthrown, inasmuch\nas the \u2018temporal\u2019 power has become a member of the\nChristian body; although its work relates to the body, yet does\nit belong to the \u2018spiritual estate\u2019 . . .\nIt must indeed have been the archfiend himself who said,\nas we read in the canon law, \u2018Were the pope so perniciously\nwicked as to be dragging hosts of souls to the devil, yet he\ncould not be deposed. This is the accursed, devilish\nfoundation on which they build at Rome, and think the whole\nworld may go to the devil rather than that they should be\nopposed in their knavery. If a man were to escape\npunishment simply because he was above his fellows, then no\nChristian might punish another, since Christ has commanded\nthat each of us esteem himself the lowest and humblest of all\n(Matt. xviii. 4; Luke ix. 48). Modern World History 83\nThe second wall is even more tottering and weak: namely\ntheir claim to be considered masters of the Scriptures . . . If\nthe article of our faith is right, \u2018I believe in the holy Christian\nChurch,\u2019 the Pope cannot alone be right; else we must say, \u2018I\nbelieve in the Pope of Rome,\u2019 and reduce the Christian Church\nto one man, which is a devilish and damnable heresy. Besides\nthat, we are all priests, as I have said, and have all one faith,\none Gospel, one Sacrament; how then should we not have\nthe power of discerning and judging what is right or wrong in\nmatters of faith? . . .\nThe third wall falls of itself, as soon as the first two have\nfallen; for if the Pope acts contrary to the Scriptures, we are\nbound to stand by the Scriptures to punish and to constrain\nhim, according to Christ\u2019s commandment . . . \u2018tell it unto the\nChurch\u2019 (Matt. xviii, 15-17) . . . If then I am to accuse him before\nthe Church, I must collect the Church together . . . Therefore\nwhen need requires, and the Pope is a cause of offense to\nChristendom, in these cases whoever can best do so, as a\nfaithful member of the whole body, must do what he can\nto procure a true free council. This no one can do so well\nas the temporal authorities, especially since they are fellow-\nChristians, fellow- priests . . .\n. . . Poor Germans that we are\u2013we have been deceived! We\nwere born to be masters, and we have been compelled to\nbow the head beneath the yoke of our tyrants, and to become\nslaves. Name, title, outward signs of royalty, we possess all\nthese; force, power, right, liberty, all these have gone over\nto the popes, who have robbed us of them. They get the\nkernel, we get the husk . . . It is time the glorious Teutonic\npeople should cease to be the puppet of the Roman pontiff.\nBecause the pope crowns the emperor, it does not follow that\nthe pope is superior to the emperor. Samuel, who crowned\nSaul and David, was not above these kings, nor Nathan above\nSolomon, whom he consecrated . . . Let the emperor then be a\nveritable emperor and no longer allow himself to be stripped\nof his sword or of his scepter! 84 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 NIE_1905_Europe_-_About_1500 \u00a9 Dodd, Mead &\nCompany is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 2710788094_85ae47bb0a_b \u00a9 CIA is licensed under a\nCC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Battle_of_Vienna.SultanMurads_with_janissaries \u00a9 G.\nJansoone is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 The_maximum_extent_of_the_Safavid_Empire_und\ner_Shah_Abbas_I \u00a9 Arab Hafez is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 1600px-Taj_Mahal_(Edited) \u00a9 Jim Carter is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 1173px-1346-1353_spread_of_the_Black_Death_in_Eu\nrope_map.svg \u00a9 Flappiefh is licensed under a CC BY-\nSA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Avignon,_Palais_des_Papes_by_JM_Rosier \u00a9 Jean-\nMarc Rosier is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution\nShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Gutenberg_Bible,_Lenox_Copy,_New_York_Public_L\nibrary,_2009._Pic_01 \u00a9 NYC Wanderer (Kevin Eng) is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 Portrait_of_Martin_Luther_as_an_Augustinian_Mon\nk \u00a9 Cranach Digital Archive is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 902180838_32af255793_b \u00a9 plizzba is licensed under a\nCC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Maqamat_hariri \u00a9 Zereshk is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 Astronomical_Clock,_Prague\n\u2022 1546px-Saenredam_-\n_Het_oude_stadhuis_te_Amsterdam \u00a9 Pieter Jansz.\nSaenredam is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 1280px-La_Rendicio\u0301n_de_Granada_-_Pradilla \u00a9 Modern World History 85\nFrancisco Pradilla Ortiz is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 Portuguese_discoveries_and_explorationsV3en \u00a9\nHugo Refachinho is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Catalan_Atlas_BNF_Sheet_6_Mansa_Musa \u00a9\nAbraham Cresques is licensed under a Public Domain\nlicense\n\u2022 Guilherme_Piso_engenho_1648 \u00a9 Guilherme Piso is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license [3]\nThe Americas and Columbus\nChristopher Columbus is depicted in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol building, landing in\nthe West Indies, on an island that the natives called Guanahani on October 12, 1492.\nWhen your parents were in school, Modern World History and\nU.S. History usually began in 1492, with the Italian Cristoforo\nColon\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d of America. Even today, typical histories of\nAmerica tend to consider the moment of Columbus\u2019 landing\non October 12, 1492, to be a significant turning point. Some\ncontinue to consider Columbus a heroic explorer while others\nregard him as a monster and accuse him of deliberate genocide.\n86 Modern World History 87\nEuropean contact with the Americas was a momentous event,\nbut the story is a bit more complicated than it is usually\ndepicted. This chapter will add detail to the traditional stories of\nthe conquest and colonization of the \u201cNew World.\u201d\nOne of the most important things to know is that in 1500,\nthe populations of Europe, Africa, and the Americas were quite\nsimilar. European and Asian populations had substantially\nrecovered from the plagues of the previous two centuries and\nwere on the rise. Continental Asia dominated. China led the\nworld with 125 million people, followed by India with about\n90 million. Europe and Africa had about 80 million each, and\nthe Americas probably had a total population of around 65\nmillion. It\u2019s important to understand that on the eve of Europe\u2019s\nencounter with the Americas, their populations were very\nsimilar. This demographic parity changed very quickly, as we\nwill soon see.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why do you think stories of Columbus remain controversial?\n\u2022 Why is it important that Europe, Africa, and the Americas had\npopulations of similar size just before contact? 88 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAs described in the Introduction, the people living in the\nAmericas had been separated from Eurasia for nearly 12,000\nyears, since the end of the Ice Age. During this period, Native\nAmericans experienced their own agricultural revolution\naround the same time as Africans and Eurasians, but instead\nof domesticating cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, and\nchickens\u2013which were not native to the Americas\u2013they\ndeveloped certain plants, creating three of the world\u2019s current\ntop five staple crops: corn, potatoes, and cassava, as well as\nadditional plants such as hot peppers, tomatoes, beans, cocoa,\nand tobacco.\nThe pyramid of Kukulc\u00e1n in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1\nReliable, storable, staple food supplies are a necessary\nprecondition for long-term settlement and population growth\n\u2013 in other words the creation of cities. Like the Europeans,\nAfricans, and Asians, once they had created a reliable food\nsupply, American natives built remarkable cities, especially in\nCentral and South America. From present-day Mexico\u2019s\nYucatan Peninsula south through Guatemala, the Maya\ndeveloped a complex society which reached its most intense\nflourishing during their \u201cClassic Period\u201d (250 CE-900 CE).\nHowever, by the time the Spanish arrived, the Maya were living\nin more separated independent city-states, seemingly having\nabandoned some of their more impressive temples and\nstructures such as Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Yucatan. This led to an Modern World History 89\ninterpretation that the original society suffered a partial collapse\nsometime around 900 CE due to feuding among these separate\ncities.\nHowever, more extensive surveying using recently developed\nlaser technology has revealed that the city-states were never that\nseparate during the Classic Period\u2014there are new structures\nand buildings that are revealed through this new research,\nshowing that the Mayan area was probably more populated than\npreviously calculated. To support such a population, the Maya\nused raised irrigated fields, creating canals\u2014and again, more\nrecent research has revealed that they bred a certain kind of\nfish to use as fertilizer, in addition to water plants and algae. In\nmountainous areas, the Maya terraced the hillsides to provide\nflat areas for planting.\nReligion and governance intertwined in Maya society, and\nstories of gods and goddesses were fundamental in the building\nof temples and determining the best times for planting and\nharvest. The Maya origin story, Popul Vuh, is surprisingly similar\nto that found in the Judeo-Christian Book of Genesis. Corn\nand the god related to corn were the principal concern for\nMaya religion and society. To record their beliefs and run their\ncomplex society, the Maya developed a written language based\non 800 hieroglyphs that represented different syllables. They\nalso developed a base-20 number system that included \u201czero\u201d\ncenturies before the concept was introduced into Western\nEurope. The preciseness of Maya mathematics, along with the\nimportance of the stars and planets to their religious beliefs,\nallowed the Maya to be more advanced than the Europeans in\nastronomy and to develop a more exact calendar.\nMayan religious beliefs included scraping down and\nredecorating their temples every sixty years. One famous\ncarved calendar used to calculate the precise time for this\nrenovation and other key ceremonies ended on December 21,\n2012, leading many to believe that the Maya had predicted the\nend of the world. In reality, it seems that the astronomers had\nsimply run out of room on that particular calendar.\nQuestions for Discussion 90 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Is it significant that several pre-Columbian cultures were not\nat their peaks when the Europeans arrived?\n\u2022 How does the existence of a written language alter how we\nthink of people\u2019s level of civilization?\nAn 1.8 meter high Olmec Head from San Lorenzo, carved of basalt, 1200\u2013900 BCE.\nFarther north in today\u2019s Mexico, the Olmecs were among the\nfirst to form a complex society\u2013they carved impressive statues\nincluding large stone heads some 3,000 years ago. Another\nsociety built the structures of Teotihuacan between 100 BCE\nand 750 CE. The nearby twin Mexica Triple Alliance capitals\nof Tenochtitl\u00e1n and Texcoco, built in the 1320s in the Valley\nof Mexico, each had more than 200,000 inhabitants when they\nwere first encountered by the Spanish, making them as large\nas Paris and Milan, Europe\u2019s most populous cities at the time.\nTenochtitl\u00e1n was built on an island in Lake Texcoco and was\nconnected to the lakeshore by a series of causeways. Modern World History 91\nThe urban Aztecs had a lot\nof people to feed. They\nsurrounded their island\ncapital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n with\nraised planting-beds called\nchinampas on floating\nplatforms in Lake Texcoco.\nThis technique allowed Aztec\nfarmers to carefully control\nsoil fertility and watering.\nThe Aztecs were so\nconcerned about the quality\nof the water, they created a\ndike across the lake that\nseparated the fresh water\naround their city from the\nMap of the Valley of Mexico when the\nSpanish arrived, showing the chinampas brackish water of the main\nsurrounding Tenochtitl\u00e1n and in lake to the east; and they\nXochimilco, where some persisted until the\ndrank water brought into the\npresent\ncity via an aqueduct from\nsprings in the hills overlooking the lake. The Aztecs supported\nsix people per acre using chinampas in the fifteenth century. By\ncomparison, Chinese intensive rice farming, the most successful\nagricultural technique known in Europe and Asia, supported\nonly about one person per acre at the same time.\nTiwanaku, located near the\nshores of Lake Titicaca in\nwhat are now the Bolivian\nhighlands, was built about\n3,500 years ago. Its 30,000\ninhabitants developed a\nfarming technique called\nflooded-raised field\nagriculture and covered the Ancient terraces surrounding Lake Titicaca\nhills around the lake with\nwalled terraces. Centuries later, the Incas maintained and\nexpanded by thousands of square miles these terraced farms\nthroughout the Andes to achieve a level of agricultural\nproduction similar to the Aztecs. For example, surrounding 92 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nLake Titicaca in Bolivia there were terraces rising from the\nlakeside elevation of 12,500 feet (nearly 3,700 meters). Dotting\nthe eastern slopes of the Andes were cities like the Inca capital\nat Cusco and its nearby towns and villages, which were also\nsurrounded by terraced farms, many of which are still in use\ntoday. These terraces were not only built and irrigated by hand\nat extremely high altitudes, but guano from coastal islands\nhundreds of miles away was carried in via well-built Inca roads\nto fertilize the Andean farms. Many of these native cities have\nbeen hidden and their buildings and terraces torn apart by\nrainforest trees over the last five centuries. Machu Picchu, a\nsmaller settlement located on a mountain peak about sixty\nmiles from Cusco, was only encountered by Westerners in 1911.\nThe fact that it had been undiscovered by the Spanish provided\na clearer picture of how the Inca had organized their\nsettlements, with terraces for agriculture and buildings made\nof seamless stonework using large blocks of carved rock\u2014far\nsuperior to most European masonry at the time.\nView of the residential section of Machu Picchu\nComplex societies in the Americas were not restricted to just\nthe Aztec, Maya, and Inca. In Colombia there is evidence of\nlarge ceremonial cities built in the northern highlands near Modern World History 93\nthe Caribbean Coast before the arrival of the Spanish, while\nother indigenous groups built complex irrigation systems in\nthe lowlands just off the Caribbean Coast. The Muisca in the\neastern highlands of present-day Colombia, settled at a high\naltitude, around 8000 feet (2600 meters) above sea level. They\ncultivated corn and quinoa on the extensive flatland valleys\nbetween the mountains, controlled extensive salt deposits, and\ntraded salt for gold, emeralds, fruits and other lowland products\nwith neighboring indigenous groups. Their architecture was\nimpressive, but built with massive tree trunks rather than stone,\nso that no examples survived the Spanish conquest.\nThe Muisca did not develop a writing system like the Maya\nand Aztecs, but maintained religious rituals and beliefs focused\non ancestor worship and the sacredness of their kings. Each\nyear, at a round ceremonial lake outside of present-day Bogot\u00e1,\nthe Muisca king powdered himself in gold dust and dove into\nthe waters as a purification rite for the gods. This practice is the\norigin of the myth of El Dorado, the \u201cGolden Man,\u201d sought by\nthe Spanish in their early explorations. Over time, Spaniards\nsuch as Coronado came to believe they were searching for a city\nof gold, which they never found.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why are native agricultural systems so impressive?\nThe natives of North America also settled in complex societies\nin various regions, based mainly on the cultivation of corn, wild\nrice, squash, and pumpkins and on managing the environment\nto promote the success of game animals. The traditional U.S.\nand Canadian Thanksgiving dinner celebrates the native foods\nof North America, including the turkey. Along the Mississippi\nRiver and its tributaries, indigenous people lived mostly in\nvillages but occasionally gathered into cities and built mounds\nlike those found at Cahokia. The Algonquian and Iroquois were\nsemi-sedentary, living throughout what is now upstate New\nYork and southern Quebec and Ontario. By the time of contact 94 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwith Europeans, the Iroquois had formed a confederacy of five\nmajor tribes. The Ojibwe and Dakota were also semi-sedentary,\nliving in settlements in the western Great Lakes region and on\nthe edge of the northern Great Plains. By the time of contact\nwith the Europeans, the Dakota dominated the Plains, where\nthey took advantage of the large herds of buffalo as a source\nof protein, clothing, and housing, while gathering wild rice and\ncultivating corn and squash for carbohydrates. Many North\nAmerican forest-dwellers also developed the sap of the maple\ntree as a key source of sugar.\nOf course, all this agriculture and city-building and\ncivilization was happening in the Americas without anyone in\nEurope, Asia, or Africa knowing about it. Although it is NOT\ntrue that everybody believed the world was flat until Columbus\ncame along, some Europeans were unclear on the actual size of\nthe Earth, the existence of American continents and the Pacific\nnot all Europeans were unaware\nOcean. But\nthere was something valuable across\nthe Atlantic. It\u2019s important to realize\nthat European exploration did not\nBEGIN with Columbus. Around 1000\nCE, five hundred years before the\nItalian explorer set out to discover a\nnew trade route to Asia for Spain,\nNorse explorers from Europe and\nIceland had established a presence on\nGreenland. The Greenland colony\nlasted four hundred years and was a\nbase for exploration and settlement\neven further west. Leif Erikson, son of\nthe Greenland colony\u2019s leader Erik the\nRed, began a colony in what is now\nnorthern Newfoundland. For a long\ntime, historians thought Scandinavian\nclaims about a North American colony\ncalled Vinland were just patriotic Modern World History 95\nfolktales. But in 1978, archaeologists\ndiscovered a site called L\u2019Anse aux\nMeadows that dates to about 1000 CE.\nThe settlement was more than just a\nfishing camp: the eight buildings\ninclude a blacksmith shop and a\nspinning room including artifacts that\nsuggest women lived there and wove\ncloth for their families.\nThe Little Ice Age was a\nperiod of global cooling that\nhit the North Atlantic\nparticularly hard beginning\naround the 1430s. Sailing\nbecame increasingly\ndangerous and as the\nagricultural season was cut\nshort by longer and more\nsevere winters, the Greenland\ncolony was abandoned in the\nearly 1400s, and without a\nbase in Greenland the Vikings\nwere unable to sustain a\n1570 map from Ska\u0301lholt, Iceland, showing\nGreenland and North American locations North American colony. They\nvisited by Vikings. also faced strenuous\nopposition from natives they\ncalled Skraelings, who according to the Viking sagas were fierce\nwarriors. This map made in Iceland in 1570 identifies the area at\nthe latitude of Newfoundland as Skralinge Land. North of that is\nMarkland (land of forests) and Helleland (land of flat stones),\nthen Greenland. And on a more recent map of Greenland, from\n1747, you can see the names of old Viking settlements as well as\na channel it was believed had once cut through the island. The\ntext on the map reads, \u201cIt is said that these streights [sic] were\nformerly passable, but now they are shut up with ice.\u201d On both\nsides of Greenland, the map says \u201cThe Coast is for the most part\ninaccessible by reason of floating and fixed mountains of ice.\u201d 96 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nTextbooks tend to stress European desire for gold and silver,\nand finding precious metals was very important to explorers like\nthe conquistadors. But we shouldn\u2019t underestimate Europeans\u2019\nfear of famine, especially during the Little Ice Age. Even before\nColumbus\u2019s voyage, Basque and Portuguese fishermen were\nregularly visiting the Grand Banks off the coast of\nNewfoundland to catch cod. A 1497 account by Giovanni Caboto\n(another Italian explorer who anglicized his name to John\nCabot) claimed cod were so plentiful on the coast of North\nAmerica that European fishermen could almost walk from ship\nto ship on their backs. Salted cod is still an important element\nof traditional Portuguese cuisine, although nowadays they get\ntheir fish from Norway. The fisheries were originally a closely-\nguarded trade secret, but by the time Columbus made his\nfamous journey they were well-known \u2013 and since cod was\nusually dried on racks onshore before being carried back to\nEurope, Columbus and his crew were probably not the first\nEuropeans to make landfall in the Americas after the Viking\nsettlements had been abandoned. Modern World History 97\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did historians tend to disbelieve stories of Viking\nsettlement in Vinland until recently?\n\u2022 Why were Europeans so interested in sailing across the\nAtlantic to fish for cod?\nColumbus\u2019s promise to find a sea-route to Asia interested\nEuropean monarchs like Ferdinand and Isabella because land-\nbased trade routes to Asia were becoming more difficult and\nexpensive. The collapse of the Mongol Empire at the end of the\nthirteenth century and the plagues of the fourteenth century\nincreased the perceived danger of overland travel. Columbus\nhad failed to interest Portugal in his proposal, because\nBartolomeu Dias had already discovered a route to Asia around\nthe bottom of Africa. On the other hand, Spain had recently\nunified with the marriage of King Ferdinand of Aragon and\nQueen Isabella of Castille, and the monarchs had just completed\nthe Reconquista and ejected Muslims from Granada, their last\nkingdom on the Iberian peninsula.\nIt is worth considering that as they turned their interests\noutward, the Spanish had been at war for nearly 800 years.\nTheir war on behalf of religion and glory would continue in 98 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthe New World. It\u2019s also worth noting that the inventions that\nsparked this new era of exploration and empire building, like\nthe sternpost rudder, the compass, gunpowder, and the printing\npress, were all Chinese inventions that found their way to\nEurope over an already-existing international trade network\ndominated by Arab merchants, which was about to become\ntruly global with the European encounter of the Americas.\nColumbus arrived in the Caribbean on October 12, 1492, and\nexplored until late December. His flagship, the Santa Maria,\nran aground on Hispaniola on December 25 and had to be\nabandoned. With permission of the local chief, Columbus left\n39 sailors behind in a settlement he named La Navidad. He\nreturned to Europe with two ships, a few captive Taino natives,\nsome gold, and specimens of New World species including\nturkeys, pineapple, and tobacco. Arriving in Barcelona in mid-\nMarch, Columbus was celebrated as a hero.\nIt is often mentioned that Columbus believed he had reached\nAsia, and he did make that claim in his extravagant \u201cLetter on\nthe First Voyage.\u201d But this document was the explorer\u2019s report\nto his royal sponsors, and Columbus wanted very badly to be\nsent back again. Columbus wrote \u201cHispaniola is a miracle\u2026both\nfertile and beautiful\u2026the harbors are unbelievably good and\nthere are many wide rivers the majority of which contain gold.\u201d\nWhether or not Columbus understood he was reporting on\nlands previously unknown to Europeans, he definitely got his\nreaders excited about the places he had visited. Modern World History 99\nWhen other European explorers reached America they were\nequally amazed. People throughout Europe read exciting\ntraveler\u2019s accounts like Amerigo Vespucci\u2019s 1504 best-seller,\nMundus Novus, which actually coined the term New World\nand made it clear for anyone who might still be confused, that\nthese lands were not Asia but a previously unknown continent.\nLike Columbus, the explorers carried back to Europe not only\neyewitness accounts of wealthy civilizations, but samples of\nnative plants, animals, and captive people.\nColumbus returned to the Caribbean in 1493 with 17 ships,\n1,200 men, and according to his diaries, \u201cseeds and cuttings\nfor the planting of wheat, chickpeas, melons, onions, radishes,\nsalad greens, grape vines, sugar cane, and fruit stones for the\nfounding of orchards.\u201d Other old-world crops that thrived in the\nAmericas included coffee and bananas, originally cultivated in\nAfrica and Asia, which were brought from the Canary Islands\nin 1516. The Spanish had introduced sugar cultivation to the\nCanary Islands in the early fifteenth century, and transplanted\ncanes to the tropical paradise their explorers had discovered\nacross the Atlantic.\nCattle were delivered to Spanish conquistadors in Mexico in\n1521. Most of the significant Eurasian species brought to the\nAmericas by European explorers and colonists were introduced\nby the Spanish by the early 1500s, long before North American 100 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsettlement began. Even species like the wild horses of the\nAmerican West that would transform Plains Indian culture in\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were the descendants\nof escapees from the herds of the conquistadors. The Americas\nhad very few large mammal species, and most could not be\ndomesticated. Nearly all the species humans have successfully\ndomesticated, the familiar residents of the modern farmyard,\noriginated in Europe and Asia. These include goats, sheep, cows,\nhorses, pigs and chickens.\nThe Spanish and Portuguese dominated the first century of\nexploration, conquest and colonization in the Americas for\nmany reasons. Spain and Portugal had an eight-century long\ntradition of warfare from fighting the Reconquista against the\nMoors, and were prepared for further battle for glory and\nreligion. The Portuguese also had a maritime tradition, which\nwas how Columbus learned his trade. But the two Catholic\nnations also had a papal charter. The Spanish and Portuguese\nwere granted a license by the Pope under the 1494 Treaty of\nTordesillas, which awarded all the territory east of the 47th\nmeridian to Portugal and everything west of it to Spain. The\nPope (Alexander VI) who made this deal was a Spaniard named\nRodrigo Borja \u2013 his reign was known for nepotism and\ncorruption, and, despite a pledge of clerical celibacy, he was\nthe father of the famous Italian political family known for\npoisoning their enemies, the Borgias. The Portuguese received\nthe east, because they were already establishing colonies on the\neast and west coasts of Africa. The Spanish were assigned the\nunknown west, which turned out to be bigger than anyone had\nexpected. The Pope granted nothing to any other European\nkingdom. This type of corruption at the Vatican helped\nmotivate reformers like Martin Luther toward what became the\nProtestant Reformation. Modern World History 101\n1502 map showing the line drawn by the Treaty of Tordesillas cutting through South\nAmerica.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were the Spanish monarchs interested in financing\nColumbus\u2019 voyage but the Portuguese not?\n\u2022 What caused Europeans to get so excited about the newly-\ndiscovered lands?\n\u2022 Why did the Spanish and Portuguese dominate early\ncolonization?\nThe Columbian Exchange\nHistorians call the transfer of plants and animals that began\nwith the encounter between Europe and the Americas after 1492\nthe Columbian Exchange. The directions of these biological\ntransfers and their effects on the environments and people of\nEurope and the Americas shaped the modern world we live in.\nAmerican maize, potatoes, and cassava fed growing European,\nAfrican, and Asian populations, allowing the building of new\ncities and industries. European animals such as pigs, sheep,\nchickens, and cattle thrived in the Americas, enabling both\nNative Americans and Europeans there to add and maintain\nanimal protein to their diets and eventually expand their\npopulations. But before most of the indigenous had a chance\nto benefit from the new food sources introduced by Europeans, 102 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthey were struck down by the largely accidental transfer of\nviruses and bacteria from Europe to America, which caused the\ndeaths of at least 90% of the native American population.\nWhen prehistoric Eurasians began living in close contact with\nthe species they domesticated, the people were affected almost\nas much as the animals they kept. Most of humanity\u2019s major\ndiseases originated in animals and crossed from domesticated\nspecies to their human keepers. Whooping cough and influenza\ncame from pigs; measles and smallpox from cattle; malaria and\navian flu from chickens. The people who domesticated these\nspecies and lived with the animals for generations co-evolved\nwith them. Animal diseases became survivable when people\ndeveloped antibodies and immunity. Without the inherited\nprotection enjoyed by most Eurasians and Africans, even a\nroutine childhood disease such as chickenpox was initially\ndevastating for Native Americans, who did not have\ndomesticated animals and thus little acquired immunity to\nthese diseases.\nThe introduction of a disease into an area without inherited\nimmunity is called a virgin soil epidemic. Such epidemics had\nhappened in Eurasia, when the Romans spread smallpox into\nthe populations they conquered, and in Europe when the\nexpanding Mongols introduced bubonic plague, the Black\nDeath that killed probably half the population of Europe in\nthe fourteenth century, reducing world population by about\na hundred million. Virgin soil epidemics spread across the\nAmericas when explorers and colonists introduced Eurasian\ndiseases to the Native Americans. The Eurasian diseases that\nattacked native populations included smallpox, measles,\nchickenpox, influenza, typhus, cholera, typhoid, diphtheria,\nbubonic plague, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and malaria. Modern World History 103\nThe impact of these\nEurasian diseases on Native\nAmericans was one of human\nhistory\u2019s most abrupt and\nsevere population disasters.\nEven the Black Death did not\nkill as large a percentage of\nEuropeans, and when\ndiseases recurred in Europe,\n1540 European depiction of Aztecs they generally killed their\nsuffering from smallpox. victims over a much longer\ntime-span due to the\ninherited immunity of European populations. American native\npopulations had no such safeguards, and disease spread\nvirulently. For example, there were over a million people living\non the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1492 when Columbus\nleft his 39 sailors in La Navidad. By 1548, there were only 500\nnatives left alive. 999,500 people had disappeared in a little over\n50 years.\nThe populations of other Caribbean islands like Cuba were\nsimilarly wiped out. Whole societies disappeared, and this was\nnot only a tragedy for the cultures that vanished. The reduction\nof native populations began a cycle of violence that became\ncentral to the history of the Americas. Once there were no\nnatives left to work on European sugar plantations, enslaved\nAfricans\u2014who had a similar acquired immunity as\nEuropeans\u2014were considered crucial to the survival of the West\nIndies sugar economy.\nThe greater population densities of Central and South\nAmerica enabled contagious diseases to spread more quickly\nthere. Heavily-traveled roads in central Mexico actually helped\nspread disease beyond areas that had been reached by Spanish\nexplorers. Cities were wiped out that had never seen a white\nman. The population of the Aztec heartland dropped from\nabout 25 million on the eve of the Spanish conquest in 1519\nto just under 17 million a decade later. One out of every three\nnative people died in just ten years. After another decade the\nAztec population was reduced to about 6 million. Three out of\nfour people in the Aztec world disappeared in 20 years. Imagine 104 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwriting a list of your 10 closest friends and family, and then\nrandomly crossing off seven names. By 1580, the Aztec empire\nhad been hollowed out to less than 2 million people, from a\nstarting point of 25 million. Cross off two more \u2014 you\u2019re down\nto one friend.\nThe depopulation of the\nAmericas is one of the Earth\u2019s\nmost significant population\ndisasters, both in its human\ntoll and in the changes it\nbrought about. Over the\nyears, as you might expect,\nthere has been a lot of\ncontroversy about what\nhappened. Critics of Spanish\ncolonialism (many of them\nSpanish, like the priest 1524 Spanish map of Mexico City, built on\ntop of Tenoctitl\u00e1n.\nBartolom\u00e9 de las Casas) have\naccused Spaniards of\natrocities in what has become known as \u201cthe Black Legend\u201d. To\ndefend themselves, colonialists accused the Aztec and Inca\nEmpires with atrocities of their own and have emphasized the\nsupport conquistadors received from indigenous rivals of these\nempires. Textbooks often reflect some of these biases, one, for\nexample, mentions that \u201cAllegedly, between 20,000 and 80,000\nmen, women, and children were slaughtered in a single\nceremony in 1487\u201d as a sacrifice at a temple in the Aztec capital\nof Tenochtitl\u00e1n. This claim may or may not be true, but even if\nit is, compare it to the deaths of over 20 million men, women,\nand children that followed the Spanish invasion of the Aztec\nlands of Central Mexico.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were native populations so susceptible to European\ndiseases?\n\u2022 How did disease affect native societies\u2019 ability to resist Modern World History 105\nEuropean invaders?\nTraditional\nEuropean or\nEurocentric\nAmerican\nhistories of\nexploration often\npresent the\nvictory of the\nSpanish over the\n1550 illustration shows Cort\u00e9s meeting\nMoctezuma for the first time with Malintzin Aztec as an\nat his side to translate.\nexample of the\nsuperiority of Europeans over the\nsavage Indians. The reality is far more\ncomplex. When Cort\u00e9s explored\ncentral Mexico, he encountered a\nregion simmering with native conflict.\nFar from being unified and content\nunder Aztec rule, many peoples in\nMexico resented the overlords of\nTenochtitl\u00e1n and were ready to rebel.\nCort\u00e9s was also aided by an enslaved Nahua woman, Malintzin\n(also known as La Malinche or Do\u00f1a Marina, her Spanish name),\nwhom the natives of Tabasco gave him as a tribute slave. In\naddition to speaking Nahua and Maya, Malintzin quickly\nlearned Spanish and translated for Cort\u00e9s in his dealings with\nAztec emperor Moctezuma.\nMalintzin also (willingly or under pressure) entered into a\nphysical relationship with Cort\u00e9s. Their son, Mart\u00edn, was one\nof the first \u201cmestizos\u201d (persons of mixed indigenous American\nand European descent) in Spanish America. Malintzin remains\na controversial figure in the history of the Atlantic World. Some 106 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nview her as a traitor because she helped Cort\u00e9s conquer the\nAztecs, while others see her as a victim of European imperialism\nwhose choices were very limited. In either case, she\ndemonstrates one way in which native peoples responded to\nthe arrival of the Spanish. Without her, Cort\u00e9s would not have\nbeen able to communicate, and without the language bridge, he\nsurely would have been less successful in destabilizing the Aztec\nEmpire. By this and other means, native people helped shape\nthe conquest of the Americas.\nThe Inca Empire in the\nAndes suffered the same fate.\n90% of the South Americans\ndied, and they started dying\nBEFORE the white invaders\narrived in 1532, which caused\nconfusion and dismay. When\nPizarro crossed the Andes\nwith eighty conquistadors, he\nfound social chaos. Huayna\nCapac, the Inca leader who\nhad triumphantly extended\nthe empire into Chile and\nEcuador, had died of\nsmallpox in 1527. His two sons\nfought a brutal civil war for\ncontrol of the empire, the\nyounger son Atahualpa finally\ndefeating and assassinating\nhis older brother Hu\u00e1scar.\nInca roads, the extent of the empire, and The civil war exacerbated the\nInca cities taken over by the Spanish\neffects of epidemics, and the\nweakness of the reduced Inca population gave Pizarro the\nopportunity he needed to capture and kill Atahualpa in 1533,\nbeginning the end of the Inca empire.\nAlthough the conquistadors focused much of their energy\non Central and South America, they brought disease to North\nAmerica as well. After helping Pizarro conquer the Inca,\nHernando De Soto landed an expedition in Florida in 1539 and\nexplored territory now in the states of Georgia, South Carolina, Modern World History 107\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and\nOklahoma. Everywhere he went, the conquistador reported the\nland was \u201cthickly settled with large towns.\u201d\nDe Soto didn\u2019t stay long. He died of fever in Louisiana in\n1542, and although the region was visited by a few missionaries,\nit was not seriously considered again by Europeans until the\nFrench aristocrat, La Salle, traveled down the Mississippi River\nin 1670. Where De Soto had seen fortified towns, La Salle saw\nnone. The entire region had been emptied by the diseases which\naccompanied De Soto and his men, and had returned to\nwilderness. The French explorer reported traveling hundreds of\nmiles without passing a single village. Historians were actually\nunaware until recently that the American South had once been\nheavily populated before the arrival of contagious Spanish\nexplorers and missionaries.\nSpanish invaders had not deliberately infected the natives\nwith all these diseases (Europeans still had no idea at this time\nhow viruses or bacteria worked), but they were quick to take\nadvantage of the opportunities provided by the social chaos and\nmilitary weakness of native societies in crisis. In both Mexico\nand Peru, the conquistadors found allies among different\nindigenous groups who often thought of themselves as the\nvictors, with Spanish help, rather than the other way around.\nStill, within a few years, the Spaniards took over the capital\ncities of the Inca and Aztec empires, inserting themselves into\nthe top positions in the pre-existing governments. Patterns of\ntribute were maintained, as well as the labor draft of the Inca\nmita\u2014although now labor would be devoted to the silver mines\nand not just road, irrigation, and building projects.\nAs they had been in Spain during the Reconquista,\nconquistadors were rewarded for military service with\nencomiendas. From a root word meaning \u201centrusting,\u201d\nencomiendas were grants of captured territory and the people\nthat lived on it, who the encomendero was theoretically\nresponsible for bringing into the Christian community. This\ntechnique had been used in Spain to keep track of conquered\nMuslims and make sure they did not backslide after their forced\nconversions. In Spanish America, there was a much greater 108 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nemphasis on taxing and working the new peasants, rather than\nleading them to religion.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Was Malintzin a heroine or a villain in her collaboration with\nCort\u00e9s?\n\u2022 How were regions far from the main points of European\ncontact affected? What do you imagine it was like for natives?\n\u2022 What tools did the colonizers use to organize native labor?\nEurope\nAs previously mentioned, American staple crops were\nsuccessfully adopted by farmers in Europe, providing better\nand more reliable nutrition which sparked a population boom.\nNew foods like potatoes were so important in preventing the\ncyclical famines that regularly hit Europe, that they became a\nkey topic in Adam Smith\u2019s classic, On the Wealth of Nations. Many\nplant species developed by native Americans are still crucial to\nthe world economy, including not only maize, potatoes, and\ncassava, but also tomatoes, sweet potatoes, cacao, chili peppers,\nnatural rubber, tobacco, and vanilla. Quinine, a medicine made\nfrom the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree, was effective\ntreating malaria and helped open the African and Asian tropics\nto European colonization. Eurasian plants like sugar, soybeans,\noranges, bananas, and rice (which probably reached America\nfrom Africa along with enslaved women who were experts\ngrowing it) were also extensively cultivated in the Americas for\nprofitable shipment back to European markets. Exports of\nnative and transplanted crops helped feed growing cities and,\nby the mid-18th century, freed agricultural workers to enter\nEurope\u2019s new industries. Without inexpensive and abundant\nNative American foods, there might have been no Industrial\nRevolution. Modern World History 109\nLike the Portuguese in their\nexploration of Africa, the\nSpanish were also interested\nin finding sources of gold and\nsilver for the European\ncommerce. Although they\nnever found El Dorado, the\n\u201cgolden man\u201d that expanded\nin legends to a city of gold,\nEuropeans did find a fair The first image of Potos\u00ed published in\nAnd Europe in 1553.\namount of gold.\nthey found even more silver. For\nexample, the Bolivian city of Potos\u00ed,\nlocated in the Andes at an elevation of\n13,420 feet (over 4,000 meters), still\nhas the largest population of any city\nat that altitude. Potos\u00ed was established\nby the Spanish in 1542 on the site of a\nlong-standing native mining village at\nthe foot of the Cerro Rico, which is a\nliteral mountain of silver. Potos\u00ed has a\ncurrent population of about 165,000,\nalmost identical to the city\u2019s\npopulation in 1660, when the high-\naltitude mining center was larger than\nSeville, Madrid, or Rome, and when\nthe combined population of ALL\nEuropean colonies in North America\nwas only about 75,000. 110 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPotos\u00ed today\nSpanish silver coins called \u201cpieces of eight\u201d from the Cerro\nRico and from similar mines in Zacatecas, Mexico, were so\nplentiful that they became the international currency of Europe\nand much of Asia. Every year between 1566 and 1815, a treasure\nfleet sailed from Acapulco to Manila laden with silver for the\ntrade in China and India. Another fleet carried not only\nprecious metals but spices and expensive Chinese ceramics\nacquired in Asia from Veracruz to Spain.\nOnce again, products originating in the Americas were a spur\nto the Industrial Revolution. Without the money minted from\nLatin America\u2019s silver and gold, there might have been no global\ncommercial boom to finance European industrialization. And\nPotos\u00ed\u2019s story is not over yet. Although most of the easily-\nextractible silver was taken out of the mountain centuries ago,\nthe Cerro Rico is still being worked by Bolivian children whose\nstory is told in the award-winning documentary, The Devil\u2019s\nMiner, which you can view on the web if you\u2019re interested in\nlearning more.\nQuestion for Discussion Modern World History 111\n\u2022 What were the main economic effects of Spanish colonialism\nin Europe?\nMestizos\nBecause most of the Spanish in the New World were male\nsoldiers in the first decades of the conquest, women were taken,\noften forcibly, from native communities to be wives and\nmistresses. One high-ranking Inca native named Felipe\nGuaman Poma de Ayala wrote to the King of Spain around 1600,\ncomplaining that Spaniards are taking all the Indian women of\nchildbearing age, so the place was being flooded with mestizos\nwho were not required to work as the Indians were. Worse, the\nfathers were not supporting their illegitimate children, and \u201cif a\nSpaniard steals away four Indian women to make little mestizos,\nhe will bribe the judges and refuse to recognize his paternity,\u201d\nleaving their support up to the state. \u201cSpaniards ought to live\nlike Christians,\u201d Guaman argued, \u201cmarrying ladies of equal\nstatus and leaving the poor Indian women alone so they can\nhave Indian children.\u201d\nMost of the countries of Latin America are built on mixed or\nmestizo populations; so much so that in the 1700s, the colonists\ntried to make distinctions between all the various types of\npeople they believed made up their societies, to \u201cprove\u201d to the\nSpanish Crown that a logical caste system existed in the\ncolonies. Although these distinctions were somewhat arbitrary\nand were often used to uphold the power of the group at the\ntop, in the long run many of these mixed Euro-American\npopulations have developed strong ethnic identities. A similar\nprocess happened in New France\u2013today\u2019s Quebec in Canada.\nThere were only about twenty-five hundred French people in\nthe province by 1663. Most of them were voyageurs, fur traders\nwho went into the northern forests to make their fortunes.\nVoyageurs frequently married local Indian women, and their\nCanadian descendants are now recognized as a distinct ethno-\ncultural group called M\u00e9tis. 112 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA \u201cCasta\u201d painting from colonial Spanish America, showing the variety of supposed\nsocial divisions created by ethnic mixing.\nThe social caste system developed in Latin America was based\non both blood and origin. At the top were peninsulares, Spaniards\nborn in Spain (on the Iberian Peninsula), who were appointed\nto nearly all of the important administrative positions in the\ngovernment and to the highest clerical offices (archbishops and\nbishops). Next were criollos (creoles), Spaniards born in the Modern World History 113\ncolonies. They made up the landed elite, often descendants of\nthe original encomenderos, and were the vast majority of the\nmerchant class and some of the higher clergy. Beneath them\nwere mestizos, people of mixed race, who worked as artisans\nand in the lower clergy, or farmed their own small holdings or\nthe estates of criollo landowners. Indians were below mestizos,\nand although they often managed their own communities\n(under supervision of missionary priests), tribute and labor\nobligations required them to work in the wage economy\nmanaged by the Spanish. Later, when the colonists started\nimporting African slaves, new designations like mulatto and\nzambo were developed to describe children of black-white and\nblack-Indian unions. These new \u201cmixed\u201d populations often\nplayed the same role in the economy and society as mestizos,\nalthough they were located closer to the sugar-growing regions\nto which enslaved Africans were initially brought.\nThe Portuguese were initially more interested in dominating\ntrade routes in the Indian Ocean, so they mostly ignored their\nnew possession in Brazil until French Huguenots\u2014protestant\nChristians fleeing Catholic France\u2014tried to establish a colony\nnear present-day Rio de Janeiro in the mid-1500s. By that time,\nthe Portuguese had watched the Spanish become successful\ncultivating sugar cane in the Caribbean. Sugar, which the\nSpanish and Portuguese had learned how to grow and process\nin the Middle East during the Crusades, was already grown with\nenslaved African labor on profitable plantations in Portugal\u2019s\nisland colonies off the African coast. Portuguese entrepreneurs\nbrought cane and slaves to Brazil and set up plantations along\nthe northern coast. By this time, the Catholic Church had\nprohibited the enslavement of Indians, but not of Africans.\nNative Brazilians did not establish the complex societies found\nin Mexico, Central America, and Andean South America, so it\nwas actually harder to \u201cconquer\u201d them, as they escaped deeper\ninto the interior jungles and forests. However, the Portuguese\nalready had established colonies and trade ties in Africa, which\nsoon supplied enslaved labor to the sugar plantations.\nQuestions for Discussion 114 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Why were the Spanish so interested in \u201cpure blood\u201d and the\nvarious degrees of ethnicity in their colonies?\n\u2022 What were the four major caste status levels in colonial\nsociety?\nAs described in the\nprevious chapter, slavery was\na traditional element in all\nworld societies, including\nthose of Africa, but\nEuropeans quickly grasped\nthe usefulness of having\nenslaved Africans in\nEuropean communities\nbecause it would be harder\nfor them to blend in with the\nlocal population. The sugar\ntrade spurred the slave trade,\nas well as European notions of\nracial superiority to justify\nthe enslavement of people\nwith darker skins.\n1563 Portuguese illustration of Africa,\nfeaturing their castle at Elmina. By the mid-1500s in\nEurope, Spanish wealth began\nto cause problems. Wealthy Spanish nobles married into\naristocratic families like the Austrian Hapsburgs. In 1519 (the\nsame year Cort\u00e9s attacked Tenochtitl\u00e1n and Magellan set out to\ncircle the Earth) the grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella, Charles\nV, became Holy Roman Emperor. Charles was also King of\nSpain and (by marriage) Portugal, which gave him legal control\nof all the American colonies. When his wife Isabella died in 1555,\nCharles was inconsolable. He abdicated in 1556 and retired to a\nmonastery, leaving his younger brother Ferdinand in charge of\nthe Holy Roman Empire in Europe and his son Philip II in\ncontrol of Spain, Portugal, and their possessions (including the\n\u201cSpanish Netherlands\u201d on the European coast).

After\nQueen Mary\u2019s death, Philip proposed to her successor, Elizabeth\nI, who turned him down. Elizabeth\u2019s father, King Henry VIII,\nhad separated the Church of England from Rome in the 1530s,\nafter a dispute with the Pope over the annulment of his\nmarriage to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and\nIsabella and aunt to Charles V. Philip supported the claim of\nMary Queen of Scots to the British throne, but when she was\nexecuted in 1587, Philip decided to invade and return England to\nCatholicism.\nIn 1588, the Spanish Armada organized by Philip was\nhampered by bad weather on the English Channel and then\ndefeated by the British Royal Navy, which lost no ships while\nSpain lost five before withdrawing. During the retreat, most of\nthe Spanish navy was destroyed by storms, leaving the British\nin control of the Atlantic. Later that year an English fleet sailed\ninto the harbor at Cadiz, burned 200 Spanish ships and made\noff with the annual silver shipment. It was the beginning of the\nend of the Spanish Empire as a major European power. 116 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAnother reason Spain did\nnot permanently dominate\nthe European economy was\nthat for centuries most of the\nsilver they shipped from Peru\nand Mexico ended up in\nChina, where silver was the\nbasis of the earth\u2019s largest\neconomy.

In addition to the Mings\nin China, the Mughals in India ruled an empire of 150 million\npeople, and they were very interested in expanding trade with\nthe West. India was also highly productive; between the two\nempires, Asia produced 80% of all the world\u2019s goods. Even\nthough we are concentrating in this chapter on the intricacies of\nthe Atlantic World and the intersection of Africa, Europe, and\nthe Americas, until the mid-1700s, it is important to remember\nthat China and India dominated world commerce and industry.\nChinese silks and Indian cotton were the world\u2019s best quality\nand lowest-cost textiles, and clothes made from them were\nworn throughout the world \u2013 even in Spain\u2019s colonies where\nthe law required people to trade only with the home country.\nThe national costume of Mexico is called the China Poblana;\nit was originally a contraband silk dress worn by women of\nthe towns. The British were so intimidated by Asian textiles\nthat they imposed tariffs to try to protect their own weavers\nfrom being driven out of the business. Mercantilism, in which\ncolonies served the home country as both a market and a source\nof raw materials in a closed economy, was actually not a\nprimitive economic system that evolved into free market\ncapitalism \u2013 it was an attempt to shield British and European\nmerchants from an already-existing international free market\nin which they were too often the losers to the dominant Asian\npowers. Modern World History 117\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did dynastic politics in Europe affect the American\ncolonies?\n\u2022 Why was Asia so important to colonial America?\nPrimary Source Supplement #1: Leif Ericsson\u2019s Discovery of\nAmerica, from the Saga of Eric the Red, 1387.\nBiarni Heriulfsson came out from Greenland on a visit to\nEarl Eric, by whom he was well received. Biarni gave an\naccount of his travels [while lost at sea in a fog for several\ndays, he apparently landed in America] when he saw the\nlands, and the people though that he had been lacking in\nenterprise, since he had no report to give concerning these\ncountries; and the fact brought him reproach. Biarni was\nappointed one of the Earl\u2019s men, and went out to Greenland\nthe following summer. There was now much talk about\nvoyages of discovery. Leif, the son of Eric the Red, of\nBrattahlid, visited Biarni Heriulfsson and bought a ship of him,\nand collected a crew, until they formed altogether a company\nof thirty-five men. Leif invited his father, Eric, to become the\nleader of the expedition, but Eric declined, saying that he was\nthen stricken in years, and adding that he was less able to\nendure the exposure of sea life than he had been. Leif replied\nthat he would nevertheless be the one who would be most\napt to bring good luck and Eric yielded to Leif\u2019s solicitation,\nand rode from home when they were ready to sail.\nWhen he was but a short distance from the ship, the horse\nwhich Eric was riding stumbled, and he was thrown from his\nback and wounded his foot, whereupon he exclaimed, \u201cIt is\nnot designed for me to discover more lands than the one\nin which we are now living, nor can we now continue longer\ntogether.\u201d Eric returned home to Brattahlid, and Leif pursued\nhis way to the ship with his companions, thirty-five men. One\nof the company was a German, named Tyrker. They put the\nship in order; and, when they were ready, they sailed out to 118 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsea, and found first that land which Biarni and his shipmates\nfound last. They sailed up to the land, and cast anchor, and\nlaunched a boat, and went ashore, and saw no grass there.\nGreat ice mountains lay inland back from the sea, and it was\nas a [tableland of] flat rock all the way from the sea to the\nice mountains; and the country seemed to them to be entirely\ndevoid of good qualities. Then said, Leif \u201cIt has not come to\npass with us in regard to this land as with Biarni, that we have\nnot gone upon it. To this country I will now give a name and\ncall it Helluland [the land of flat rocks].\u201d\nThey returned to the ship, put out to sea, and found a\nsecond land. They sailed again to the land, and came to\nanchor, and launched the boat, and went ashore. This was a\nlevel wooded land; and there were broad stretches of white\nsand where they went, and the land was level by the sea. Then\nsaid Leif, \u201cThis land shall have a name after its nature; and\nwe will call it Markland [land of forests].\u201d They returned to the\nship forthwith, and sailed away upon the main with north-east\nwinds, and were out a full day before they sighted land. They\nsailed toward this land and came to an island which lay to the\nnorthward off the land. There they went ashore and looked\nabout them, the weather being fine, and they observed that\nthere was dew upon the grass, and it so happened that they\ntouched the dew with their hands, and touched their hands\nto their mouths, and it seemed to them that they had never\nbefore tasted anything so sweet as this. They went aboard\ntheir ship again and sailed into a certain sound, which lay\nbetween the island and a cape, which jutted out from the land\non the north, and they stood in westering past the cape. At\nebb-tide, there were broad reaches of shallow water there,\nand they ran their ship aground there, and it was a long\ndistance from the ship to the ocean; yet were they so anxious\nto go ashore that they could not wait until the tide should rise\nunder their ship, but hastened to the land, where a certain\nriver flows out from a lake. As soon as the tide rose beneath\ntheir ship, however, they took the boat and rowed to the ship,\nwhich they conveyed up the river, and so into the lake, where\nthey cast anchor and carried their hammocks ashore from the\nship and built themselves cabins there.\nThey afterward determined to establish themselves there Modern World History 119\nfor the winter, and they accordingly built a large house. There\nwas no lack of salmon there either in the river or in the\nlake, and larger salmon than they had ever seen before. The\ncountry thereabouts seemed to be possessed of such good\nqualities that cattle would need no fodder there during the\nwinters. There was no frost there in the winters, and the\ngrass withered but little. The days and nights there were of\nmore nearly equal length than in Greenland or Iceland. On\nthe shortest day of winter, the sun was up between 7:30\nand 3:30 [suggesting a latitude of about 50\u00b0]. When they had\ncompleted their house, Leif said to his companions, \u201cI\npropose now to divide our company into two groups, and to\nset about an exploration of the country. One-half of our party\nshall remain at home at the house, while the other half shall\ninvestigate the land; and they must not go beyond a point\nfrom which they can return home the same evening, and are\nnot to separate [from each other]. Thus they did for a time.\nLeif, himself, by turns joined the exploring party, or remained\nbehind at the house. Leif was a large a powerful man, and of\na most imposing bearing; a man of sagacity, and a very just\nman in all things.\n\u2026.\nEric the Red also died that winter. There was now much\ntalk about Leif\u2019s Vinland journey; and his brother, Thorvald,\nheld that the country had not been sufficiently explored.\nThereupon Leif said to Thorvald, \u201cIf it be thy will, brother, thou\nmayest go to Vinland with my ship.\u201d And so it was done.\n\u2026.\nThey were soon provided with an abundant and goodly\nsupply of food; for a whale of good size and quality was driven\nashore there, and they secured it, and flensed it, and had then\nno lack of provisions. The cattle were turned out upon the\nland, and the males soon became very restless and vicious:\nthey had brought a bull with them. Karlsefni caused trees to\nbe felled and to be hewed into timbers wherewith to load\nhis ship, and the wood was placed upon a cliff to dry. They\ngathered somewhat of all of the valuable products of the\nland: grapes, and all kinds of game and fish, and other good\nthings. In the summer succeeding the first winter Skrellings 120 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwere discovered. A great troop of men came forth from out\nthe woods. The cattle were hard by, and the bull began to\nbellow and roar with a great noise, whereat the Skrellings\nwere frightened, and ran away with their packs, wherein were\ngray furs, sables, and all kinds of pelts. They fled towards\nKarlsefni\u2019s dwelling and sought to effect an entrance into the\nhouse; but Karlsefni caused the doors to be defended [against\nthem].\nSource: American historical documents, 1000-1904: with\nintroductions and notes.

Are you the king? Is it true\nthat you are the king Montezuma?\u201d\nAnd the king said: \u201cYes, I am Montezuma.\u201d Then he stood up\nto welcome Cort\u00e9s; he came forward, bowed his head low and\naddressed him in these words: \u201cOur lord, you are weary.

Welcome to your land, my lords!\u201d\nWhen Montezuma had finished, La Malinche translated his\naddress into Spanish so that the Captain could understand\nit. Cort\u00e9s replied in his strange and savage tongue, speaking\nfirst to La Malinche: \u201cTell Montezuma that we are his friends.\nThere is nothing to fear. We have wanted to see him for a long\ntime, and now we have seen his face and heard his words. Tell\nhim that we love him well and that our hearts are contented.\u201d\nThen he said to Montezuma: \u201cWe have come to your house\nin Mexico as friends. There is nothing to fear.\u201d\nLa Malinche translated this speech and the Spaniards\ngrasped Montezuma\u2019s hands and patted his back to show\ntheir affection for him\u2026.\nDuring this time, the people asked Montezuma how they\nshould celebrate their god\u2019s fiesta. He said: \u201cDress him in all\nhis finery, in all his sacred ornaments.\u201d\nDuring this same time, The Sun commanded that\nMontezuma and Itzcohuatzin, the military chief of Tlatelolco,\nbe made prisoners. The Spaniards hanged a chief from\nAcolhuacan named Nezahualquentzin. They also murdered\nthe king of Nauhtla, Cohualpopocatzin, by wounding him with\narrows and then burning him alive.\nFor this reason, our warriors were on guard at the Eagle\nGate. The sentries from Tenochtitlan stood at one side of 122 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthe gate, and the sentries from Tlatelolco at the other. But\nmessengers came to tell them to dress the figure of\nHuitzilopochtli. They left their posts and went to dress him in\nhis sacred finery: his ornaments and his paper clothing.\nWhen this had been done, the celebrants began to sing\ntheir songs. That is how they celebrated the first day of the\nfiesta. On the second day they began to sing again, but\nwithout warning they were all put to death. The dancers and\nsingers were completely unarmed. They brought only their\nembroidered cloaks, their turquoises, their lip plugs, their\nnecklaces, their clusters of heron feathers, their trinkets\nmade of deer hooves. Those who played the drums, the old\nmen, had brought their gourds of snuff and their timbrels.\nThe Spaniards attacked the musicians first, slashing at their\nhands and faces until they had killed all of them. The singers-\nand even the spectators- were also killed. This slaughter in\nthe Sacred Patio went on for three hours. Then the Spaniards\nburst into the rooms of the temple to kill the others: those\nwho were carrying water, or bringing fodder for the horses, or\ngrinding meal, or sweeping, or standing watch over this work.\nThe king Montezuma, who was accompanied by\nItzcohuatzin and by those who had brought food for the\nSpaniards, protested: \u201cOur lords, that is enough!

There\nare other Islands Thirty in number, and upward bordering\nupon the Isle of St. John, totally unpeopled; all which are\nabove Two Thousand miles in length, and yet remain without\nInhabitants, Native, or People.\nAs to the firm land, we are certainly satisfied, and assured,\nthat the Spaniards by their barbarous and execrable Actions\nhave absolutely depopulated Ten Kingdoms, of greater extent\nthan all Spain, together with the Kingdoms of Aragon and\nPortugal, that is to say, above One Thousand Miles, which now\nlye waste and desolate, and are absolutely ruined, when as\nformerly no other Country whatsoever was more populous.\nNay we dare boldly affirm, that during the Forty Years space,\nwherein they exercised their sanguinary and detestable\nTyranny in these Regions, above Twelve Millions (computing\nMen, Women, and Children) have undeservedly perished; nor\ndo I conceive that I should deviate from the Truth by saying\nthat above Fifty Millions in all paid their last Debt to Nature.\nThose that arrived at these Islands from the remotest parts\nof Spain, and who pride themselves in the Name of Christians,\nsteered Two courses principally, in order to the Extirpation,\nand Exterminating of this People from the face of the\nEarth.

The\nHapsburg family continued to try to maintain an entity they\ncalled the \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d but it was really an alliance\nof German principalities, and had ceased to include Rome in\nthe 12th century. During the 1600s, religion, language, and local\nculture began inspiring feelings of regional solidarity that grew\ninto the idea of separate nationalities. Some of these nations\norganized themselves as absolute monarchies, while in others,\npower was shared among different national groups.\nThe consolidation of nationalities happened over several\ncenturies. By 1500, Europe\u2019s 80 million people were divided\ninto about 500 states and principalities. Three hundred years\nlater, Europe\u2019s population had nearly doubled and 150 million\nEuropeans lived in just 30 nations. In many of these countries,\nthe ideas of divine monarchy and hereditary nobility had given\nway to a sharing of constitutional power between rulers and\ntheir subjects. Merchants gained influence and slowly acquired\nlegislative powers in bodies like Britain\u2019s House of Commons.\nThe French Revolution, inspired in part by the revolt of\nBritain\u2019s North American colonies and the establishment of the\nUnited States, would extend the experiment with democracy to\ninclude the lower classes for the first time in European history.\nFrance\u2019s revolution, which will be presented in this chapter,\nwould end one of the most deeply-entrenched absolute\nmonarchies of Europe, while Napoleon\u2019s armies ended\nfeudalism in most of continental Europe by 1815. 130 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nFrance developed into an\nabsolute monarchy under the\nBourbon dynasty. Louis XIII\n(r. 1610-43) and his chief\nminister, Cardinal Richelieu,\nconcentrated power in the\nhands of the King. The King\nstopped convening the\nEstates General, an advisory\nbody made up of\nrepresentatives of the clergy,\nthe aristocracy, and the\nworking people, and ruled\nabsolutely.\nThe French monarchy was\nable to hold back many of the Louis XIV, the \u201cSun King\u201d\ndemocratic advances of\nneighboring nations, like the Netherlands and Britain, because\nof the centralized power and personal authority of the longest-\nreigning king in European history, Louis XIV. Known as \u201cthe\nSun King,\u201d Louis XIV occupied the French throne for 72 years,\nfrom 1643 when he became emperor at age 4 after his father\u2019s\npassing, to his death in 1715. By the 1680s, Louis had greatly\nimproved France\u2019s influence in the world and had increased the\npower of the monarchy. In 1682, Louis moved the royal court to\nVersailles, a country palace about thirteen miles from Paris,\nrequiring nobility to live in the palace where he could keep\nthem under his thumb. But he also modernized Paris, under the\ndirection of his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Modern World History 131\nConstitutional states like\nBritain shared power between\nhereditary monarchs and\nlegislative bodies that\nrepresented (some of) the\npeople. In Britain\u2019s case, the\nlegislature, called Parliament,\nalso controlled the\ngovernment\u2019s purse-strings.\nBritain fought a Civil War\nbetween 1642 and 1649 when\nGerman illustration of the execution of\nKing Charles I of England, January 30, 1649. a Protestant religious sect\nknown as the Puritans and\ntheir allies in Parliament led a revolt against absolute monarchy\nchampioned by King Charles I. The Puritans had a much stricter\ninterpretation of the Christian Bible and wanted to \u201cpurify\u201d the\nChurch of England, ridding it of remaining Catholic and\nliturgical practices not described in scripture. A Puritan-\ndominated Parliamentary army led by Oliver Cromwell beat\nthe Royalists on the battlefield and then executed Charles I in\n1649. Unfortunately, Cromwell\u2019s ten-year experiment with a\nrepublic, which he called the Commonwealth, degenerated into\na dictatorship.

The settlement may have been overrun by local\nIndians, but it is also possible that the abandoned colonists went\nto live with the natives when their food ran out and when help\nfailed to arrive from England. Throughout the early history of\nEnglish settlement in North America, colonial authorities\nregularly tried to hush up reports of poor English colonists\nchoosing to live with the Indians. The English published\nfrightening tales of captivity and redemption, although in\nreality poor people, especially women, were often better-treated\nin Indian society than in the English colonies.\nAfter losing both their people and their entire capital\ninvestment at Roanoke, the English waited nearly 20 years\nbefore they tried settling the Chesapeake Bay region again in\n1607. The Virginia Company, a joint stock venture chartered by\nKing James I in 1606, sent expeditions to the explore the coast\nof North America between the Spanish and French settlements,\none of which established Jamestown forty miles inland on the\nJames River as the first permanent English town in North\nAmerica. In 1620 a shipload of persecuted Puritans we know as\nthe \u201cPilgrims\u201d fled England and its Anglican church and landed\non Cape Cod. Ten years later another group of Puritans received Modern World History 133\na royal charter to establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony at\nBoston.\nBritish colonists in North\nAmerica focused on\nestablishing family farms for\nraising crops and pasturing\nanimals like cattle and sheep,\nand growing cash crops like\ntobacco in the warmer\nclimate of the South. By\ncontrast, French efforts on the\ncontinent centered on trade\nwith Indians for beaver pelts,\nsince the growing season was\nmuch shorter in the region\nbetween the St. Lawrence\nRiver and Hudson Bay.

But\nonce again, it worked to the\nadvantage of Europeans.\nNative populations in the\ncoastal northeast were\ndevastated by an epidemic\nthat raged from 1617 to 1619\nand killed 95 percent of the\nAbenaki people and over 90\nPuritan clergyman Cotton Mather\npercent of the Massachusetts\n(1663-1728)\ntribe. This emptying of the\nland was often seen by English settlers like the Pilgrims and the\nPuritans as a gift of divine providence. Puritan leader John\nWinthrop wrote about the favor God had shown to the colonists\nby killing the natives and minister Cotton Mather wrote that\n\u201cThe Indians of these parts had newly\u2026been visited with such a\nprodigious Pestilence; as carried away not a Tenth, but Nine\nParts of Ten (yea, \u2018tis said Nineteen of Twenty) among them\u2026So\nthat the Woods were almost cleared of those pernicious\nCreatures, to make Room for better Growth\u201d (Magnalia Christi\nAmericana, 1702). English colonists were quick to take advantage\nof the empty village sites, open farmland, and social chaos\namong the natives caused throughout the region by the ongoing\nColumbian Exchange. Modern World History 135\nAlthough many individual\nsettlers probably tried to deal\nfairly with their Indian\nneighbors, the differences\nbetween European and native\nideas of ownership and the\nrapid growth of the colonies\nmade conflict virtually\ninevitable. Natives regularly\nmoved to new locations as the\nseasons changed. They\ngardened in shifting fields.\nColonists built houses and\npermanent villages, and\nfenced their fields. But\nalthough they claimed\ncomplete ownership of the\nparcels they occupied, the\ncolonists let their cattle and\nIllustration of Metacomet, son of\nMassasoit, by Paul Revere, 1771 pigs run loose over the\ncountryside. Since the natives\nwere not protecting their lands in ways the colonists recognized,\nwith fences, the Euro-Americans believed (or at least argued)\nIndians had no idea of land ownership. The colonists were\nunaware that native practices had been created for a world\nwithout domestic livestock. When Indians treated European\nlivestock like wildlife and shot a wandering cow, or when they\nkilled pigs eating their un-fenced crops, the colonists demanded\ncompensation for the destruction of their property. And of\ncourse, more colonists arrived every year. The Powhatan wars\nin Virginia (1610-46), the Pequot War in Connecticut (1637), the\nDutch-Indian War in the Hudson Valley (1643), and the Beaver\nWars (1650) all ended badly for the natives. Even King Philip\u2019s\nWar (1675), which is remembered as a disastrous, nearly-\nsuccessful uprising by Massasoit\u2019s son Metacomet, who had\nfinally decided enough was enough, resulted in five times as\nmany native deaths as English. By the conclusion of the\nworldwide Seven Years War between the French and British\nempires (known as the French and Indian War in North 136 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAmerica) in 1763, northeastern natives were no longer\nconsidered a threat to European colonies.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did English settlement differ from Spanish or French\ncolonialism?\n\u2022 How did the Columbian Exchange affect English settlement in\nNorth America?\n\u2022 Why did English settlers believe God had intervened on their\nbehalf?\n\u2022 How did differences in land use lead to conflict between\nnatives and colonists?\nComparative Colonization: The Spanish, the British, the\nLand, the Natives\nThe contrasts between Spanish and British colonization in the\nAmericas are stark, and help explain subsequent social and\neconomic development in the Hemisphere. The differences are\nespecially visible in four areas: who the settlers were, how they\nwere governed, how they worked the land, and the nature of\ntheir relationship with the indigenous peoples. Modern World History 137\nAs described in the\nprevious chapter, the Spanish\nhad just completed an\n800-year \u201cReconquest\u201d of\nIberia from Muslim rule in\n1492, when Columbus first\nsailed west. Spain applied the\nsame model of Iberian\nconquest and colonization to\nthe Americas, granting\nconquered land with all of its\ninhabitants to the\nencomenderos, who were\nselected for their proven\nloyalty to King and empire,\nand to the Catholic Church.\nSoldiers and clergy were also\npledged to Crown and\nChurch, as well as the\nadministrators, artisans and\nHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, conqueror of the Aztecs other settlers who arrived in\nand premier encomendero of New Spain.\nSpanish America with their\nfamilies. The Portuguese in Brazil followed the same rule.\nThe British, however, used their colonies in North America as\nhavens for religious dissenters, as a safety-valve to reduce the\nnumbers of the poor in England, and as dumping grounds for\nother troublemakers. As mentioned above, Massachusetts was\nsettled by Puritans who had rejected the Church of England.\nIronically, these seekers of religious freedom were so strict and\ndogmatic that anyone who disagreed even slightly was\nunwelcome in their new \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d. Advocates of further\nreform soon left and settled Connecticut and Rhode Island,\nwhich were open to settlers of all religions\u2014except Catholics\nwho instead settled in Maryland. Another dissenting religious\ngroup from England, the Quakers, colonized Pennsylvania,\nwhile Georgia was partly settled by petty criminals\n\u201ctransported\u201d from Great Britain (Australia would serve this role\nin the late 18th and early 19th century). As a result, settlers\nof the Thirteen Colonies were less loyal to the British Crown 138 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthan the Spanish settlers of Central and South America were to\ntheir monarch. Indeed, if the Spanish had followed the British\npolicy of shipping their undesirables to the New World, \u201cLatin\u201d\nAmerica might have become \u201cJudeo-Islamic\u201d America, a place\nwhere Jews and Muslims who had refused to convert to\nCatholicism were sent.\nThe Spanish and British\nalso governed their colonies\nin very different ways. The\nSpanish Crown wanted to\ndirectly rule their American\nempire, appointing trusted\nmen\u2014the peninsulares\u2014to\nserve as viceroys, judges,\ngovernors, and mayors,\napplying laws and regulations\nmade by the Council of the\nIndies in Spain. British\ncolonists had already had\nalready a sense of self-\ngovernment through their\nThe extent of Spanish territory in the\nparliament, which checked\nAmericas in the 18th century.\nthe power of the King and\ncontrolled the treasury. Subsequently, in contrast to Spanish\nsettlers, the British colonists set up legislatures, held town-hall\nmeetings, often appointed their own governors, and made\nmany of their own laws rather than waiting for instructions\nfrom London.\nThis difference in representative government, however, does\nnot mean that the Spanish colonists were completely\ndeferential. They often applied the concept of \u201cobedezco, pero no\ncumplo\u201d (\u201cI obey, but I do not comply\u201d) to regulations made by\nthe Council of Indies that they believed did not consider local\nrealities in the Americas. Also, especially in the 1700s, artisans\nand laborers initiated local riots and uprisings against unjust\ntaxes or changes in religious governance, where the crowds\nshouted \u201cLong live the king, and death to bad government!\u201d Modern World History 139\nuntil the wrongs were righted. Similar protests in the Thirteen\nColonies would not occur until the 1770s.\nLand arrangements were also very different between the\nBritish and the Spanish. Both empires had sugar and other\nplantations which depended on enslaved African labor (which\nwe will examine below). However, for other crops (especially\nthose for local consumption), the Spanish followed the tradition\nof the encomendero (and, later, hacendero), in which a large\nlandowner employed indigenous and mestizo workers, while\nthe British settlers preferred the individual family farm. In the\nlong run, this economic difference affected attitudes about\nentrepreneurship and ideas of personal liberty. The large\nlandowners in Spanish America did not want to disrupt a social\nsystem which brought them wealth, while in the Thirteen\nColonies, even the lowliest indentured servant who had worked\nwithout pay for seven years, looked forward to gaining their\nown plot for themselves \u201cout West.\u201d\nThe fourth major difference between Spanish and British\nAmerica involves relationships with the indigenous peoples.\nBasically, the Spanish had arrived and said, \u201cThis is our land,\nobey us\u201d while the British said, \u201cThis is our land, go somewhere\nelse.\u201d The Spanish Empire included the indigenous in their\ncolonial project, partly because of the blood ties that connected\nmany of the Spanish with their mestizo descendants. Mestizos\nand Indians were often protected or at least tolerated by Spanish\nauthorities in their own settlements as long as they paid tribute\nand at least pretended to be Catholic. Just like their counterparts\nin North America, the Indians in Latin America also faced the\nproblem of the Spanish allowing their pigs and cattle to destroy\nnative plantings\u2014but as Spanish colonial records reveal, the\nindigenous brought this injustice to local Spanish judges, who\noften determined in favor of the Indians. Many natives felt\npart of colonial society, and confidently challenged Spanish\nlandowners in court. 140 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA panel from one of the many \u201cCasta paintings\u201d produced in Spanish America, 1770.\nStill, the Spanish colonies were far from a utopia for the natives.\nThey did not have complete control over their lives and the\n\u201cprotection\u201d offered by Catholic clergy required abandoning\ntheir own religion and many of their customs and practices. The\nSpanish did not want to physically eliminate the indigenous,\nbut they did advocate a cultural genocide of sorts, which was\nnever complete due to native resistance. But this was, in the\nlong run, less successful than the destruction of native culture in\nNorth America because despite the Columbian Exchange there\nwere more natives left. Native languages thrive in many parts\nof Central and South America where they are preserved and\nspoken by millions, while the tribal tongues of North America\nstruggle to stay relevant.\nThe social and economic differences between British and\nSpanish America clearly have consequences even today, some\npositive and others negative. The entrepreneurial spirit\ncommon in the United States has resulted in a less rigid class\nsystem than in Latin America, while the idea that the U.S. is a\n\u201cwhite man\u2019s country\u201d (in which African-Americans were also Modern World History 141\nexcluded) has led to systemic racism which is still an enormous\nproblem, especially when compared to attitudes about race in\nmost of Latin America, where mestizos and mulattos abound.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How did racial mixing make Spanish-American society\ndifferent from Anglo-American?\nCaribbean Islands and Sugar Cane\nMap of Barbados from Richard Ligon\u2019s True and Exact History, 1657. Note runaway\nslaves being chased into the hills at the top of map.\nIn spite of the beginning of British settlement in North America,\nBritain\u2019s main focus in the 17th century was the Caribbean. We\ntend to forget this, because this region did not join the North\nAmerican revolution in 1776 and become part of the United\nStates. But in the 1600s, Sugar Islands like Barbados and Jamaica\nwere the most profitable British colonies. Like the Spanish,\nNorth American colonists in the New World expected and\nhoped to find not only a place to build a new society, but also\na place where they could get rich. Even religious idealists such\nas the Pilgrims looked forward to opportunities for wealth and 142 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsocial mobility that had not been available to them in England.\nAnd right from the start, European colonies in North America\nwere commercial. In addition to fishing, growing tobacco, and\ntrapping beaver, the North American colonies benefited from\nthe booming sugar economy of the Caribbean.\nIslands such as Barbados that had once been self-sufficient\nhad begun by the mid-1600s to specialize in the profitable\ncommodity at the expense of all other crops, so sugar planters\nlooked to their neighbor colonies for food supplies and feed for\ndraft animals. John Winthrop, the Puritan leader who helped\nestablish Boston and who was Governor of the Massachusetts\nBay Colony four times before 1650, sent his second son Henry\nto help establish Barbados in 1626. When Oliver Cromwell\u2019s\nCivil War halted the flow of commercial shipping between\nEngland and the ten-year-old Bay Colony in 1640, trade with\nthe West Indies saved Boston\u2019s economy. Governor Winthrop\u2019s\nyounger son Samuel joined the growing community of New\nEngland merchants in the Caribbean sugar islands in 1647.\nDiagram of a slave ship, printed in 1788 for an abolitionist society brochure.\nAbout 16 million Africans were captured and transported to\nEuropean slaveholding colonies during the entire period of\nAtlantic slavery. Only 12 million arrived alive. A quarter of all Modern World History 143\nslaves taken died on the voyage across the Atlantic. Although\nslavery reduced African population by over 26 million (10\nmillion to the Islamic world and 16 million to the Atlantic),\nAmerican staples including corn and manioc created a\npopulation boom that exceeded the losses to the slave trade.\nHowever, if these 26 million people had been available to\ncontribute to African society, what social and cultural progress\nmight have been possible? Additionally, since African\nnations\u2013like other societies\u2013tended to enslave captives in war,\nconflicts among tribes and kingdoms created an unstable social\nand political climate, which made sub-Saharan Africa ripe for\nEuropean imperialists in the late nineteenth century, well after\nthe slave trade with the Americas had ended.\nUnder the Treaty of\nTordesillas, Spain was not\nallowed to purchase slaves in\nAfrica because it was part of\nthe territory granted to\nPortugal. So Spain had set up\na monopoly contract for slave\ntrading to Spanish America\ncalled the Asiento, which was\ninitially granted to France. In\n1714, Spain shifted the Asiento\nto Britain and gave the South\nSea Company a 30-year\nmonopoly on selling slaves to\nSpain. The Company set up\nslave distribution \u201cfactories\u201d\nThe Asiento, 1713 at Cartagena (Colombia),\nVeracruz (Mexico), Portobello\n(Panama), La Guaira (Venezuela), Buenos Aires (Argentina),\nHavana, and Santiago de Cuba, as well as its own colonies of\nBarbados and Jamaica. In 1720, a speculative investment\n\u201cbubble\u201d burst, throwing the British economy into crisis. The\nSouth Sea Company survived the burst of its bubble, mostly due\nto revenues from selling slaves, and its slave sales peaked in 1725,\nfive years after the financial crisis. 144 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nConditions were so harsh\non sugar plantations that\nslaves generally died after\nabout three years after their\narrival.

The economic value\nof local \u201cincrease\u201d produced by enslaved women was recognized\nin the 18th century in the North American colonies where\npeople like Thomas Jefferson wrote about the money that could\nbe made on these natural replacements. Additionally, raising\ntobacco and other crops was less harsh than cultivating sugar\ncane, creating better conditions for survival. Britain and the U.S.\nended the slave trade in 1807 and 1808 but slavery continued in\nthe U.S., where enslaved people in Mid-Atlantic states where\ntobacco was being replaced with mechanized wheat-farming\nwere \u201csold down the river\u201d to the increasingly important cotton\nplantations in the Deep South, creating a major profit\nopportunity for white Virginians.\nSlaves often resisted their\ncaptors.

Philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nbegan reimagining the relationship between individuals and\nsociety, while popular writers like Thomas Paine began\ntranslating these ideas into pamphlets like Common Sense and\ninto books like The Rights of Man and The Age of Reason that were\nread not only by other philosophers but also by hundreds of\nthousands of regular literate people. Modern World History 147\nSome of the first places\nthese Enlightenment political\nideas were tested were\nBritain\u2019s thirteen North\nAmerican colonies. The\nSeven Years War (1756-63)\nhad been an expensive drain\non Britain\u2019s treasury and\nThe Boston Tea Party, as depicted by\nParliament believed the\nNathaniel Currier in 1846.\nAmerican colonists ought to\npay their fair share of the cost of their defense. Britain instituted\na number of taxes including the Sugar Act (1764), the Stamp Act\n(1765), the Townshend Act (1767), and the Tea Act (1773).\nBoycotts and protests by the colonists soon began, including the\nfamous Boston Tea Party in 1773, during which enraged patriots\nboarded a British cargo ship and dumped tea from India into\nBoston harbor, rather than pay the hated new tax.\nAlthough the colonists found these taxes oppressive and\nobnoxious, to a great extent they were luxury taxes or excises\non trade rather than direct taxes on personal income. Still,\nimposing new taxes on the colonists was a miscalculation by\nParliament, because the merchants and the wealthy most\naffected by the taxes had the means and the motivation to\norganize a resistance movement.\nAmerican colonists also objected to the Quartering Act (1765)\nthat forced them to provide housing and food for British troops.\nAgain, this may have seemed fair to the legislators back in\nLondon who had sent an army to defend the colonies against\nthe French and Indians in the recently-concluded war. But it\nwas a big expense for the Americans, and was an issue that cut\nacross class boundaries more than the luxury taxes and unified\nopposition. Imagine being a poor farmer in New England and\nhaving a red-coat from some random region of England living\nwith you and eating your food. 148 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAnother major cause of American resentment against the\nBritish after the Seven Years War was the Royal Proclamation\nof 1763 that established a western boundary to the colonies\nroughly along the ridge-line of the Appalachian Mountains. The\nsupport of Native Americans from the trans-Appalachian region\nhad been critically important to the British war effort in North\nAmerica. Tribes such as the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois\nConfederacy) were powerful allies, and their leaders\ncomplained about the increasing numbers of settlers leaving the\ncoastal colonies to make farms in places like upstate New York, Modern World History 149\nwestern Pennsylvania, and the Ohio River Valley. The British\ncreated an Indian Reserve beyond the Appalachians, including\nwestern Virginia and Pennsylvania west of Pittsburgh, which\nhad been a French fort captured in the war. This angered both\ncolonists who looked west for new lands to settle and land\nspeculators who had planned on getting rich buying and selling\nthe western territory.\nIn addition to the famous \u201call men are created equal\u201d and\n\u201cconsent of the governed\u201d parts of the colonists\u2019 Declaration\nof Independence, the 1776 document included a laundry list of\ncomplaints against the British Crown including the charge that\nthe king had \u201cendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our\nfrontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of\nwarfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and\nconditions.\u201d The founders understood that independence would\nmean taking land from \u201cSavages\u201d. Although the Declaration\nechoed the Enlightenment ideals of contractual government\nand representation, at the time these ideals only applied to\nwhite male landowners.\nMany Indians sided with Britain in the American Revolution,\nbecause they saw a British victory as their only chance to\nprevent the colonists from overrunning them. Many slaves also\nran away to join British forces, especially after they were offered\nimmediate emancipation by Lord Dunmore. Many fought their\nformer owners in Dunmore\u2019s \u201cEthiopian Regiment\u201d or secretly\nsided with the British against colonial slaveholders. 150 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nNor did the Declaration\nspeak for all the white\ncolonists. New York City was\noccupied by the British until\n1783, well after the end of the\nfighting, and the city was a\nhaven for supporters of the\nBritish side. Historians have\nestimated the number of\nloyalists at 15-20% of the total\ncolonial population, or about\n400,000 people. Most of\nthese loyalists stayed and\nbecame U.S. citizens after the\nwar, but about 70,000 left for\nother parts of the British Loyalists being chased out of town by their\nformer neighbors.\nempire. Many of those in the\nnorth went to Canada and\nsettled New Brunswick while southerners went to Florida, which\nhad remained loyal under British rule, or to the British islands\nin the Caribbean.\nAfter the Revolution, poor Americans were often left\nwondering what they had fought for. Taxes were high and\nfarmers couldn\u2019t pay them because the \u201cContinental\u201d currency\nprinted by the rebel government to pay the troops was\nworthless. Western Massachusetts farmers who felt the new\ngovernment in Boston did not represent them revolted in 1786\nin Shays\u2019s Rebellion, which was put down by government\ntroops. This fight and others forced leaders of the Confederated\nstates to reconsider how a federal government should be\norganized, and they called a Constitutional Convention to meet\nin Philadelphia, with the Thirteen States sending\nrepresentatives.\nThe United States Constitution that formed the new\ngovernment began with the words \u201cWe the People.\u201d It\nacknowledged the Enlightenment concept that political power\ncomes from the consent of the governed. The final document\nwas influenced by the framers\u2019 studies of earlier republics and\nby negotiations over various state constitutions that had favored Modern World History 151\nthe idea of three branches of government, the legislative,\nexecutive and judicial, along with a system of checks and\nbalances that made no one branch superior to the others. For\ninstance, the President could veto laws passed by Congress,\nwhile Congress could, with a 2/3 majority, override the veto.\nAnd the Supreme Court could interpret a law as being\nunconstitutional, checking both the President and Congress.\nIn spite of these checks and balances, when the Constitutional\nConvention sent the newly-drafted US Constitution to all the\nstates for ratification, many New England towns either rejected\nthe document outright or provisionally approved it with\nmodifications they sent back to the authorities. In most cases,\ntheir provisional approvals were marked as simple YES votes\nand the carefully worked-out modifications were \u201cfiled\u201d. But\ndissatisfaction with the original Constitution was so strong, in\nspite of the series of promotional articles published about it\nthat have become known as the Federalist Papers, that the\nconvention was forced to write the first 10 Amendments (the Bill\nof Rights) and issue them at the same time. Without the Bill of\nRights, the Constitution would be a much different document.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did the British government consider the taxes they\nimposed on the colonists reasonable?\n\u2022 Why did Indians and blacks side with the British during the\nRevolution?\n\u2022 What prompted the writing of the Bill of Rights?\nThe French Revolution\nDebt problems stemming from the Seven Years War and\nFrench support for the independence of the United States\nforced King Louis XVI to call the Estates-General in 1789, in\norder to raise revenue. The Estates-General had not been called\nsince 1614, and its meeting was immediately seen as an\nopportunity to create a new parliamentary monarchy. 152 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe three \u201cestates\u201d, commoners, nobility, and clergy,\ntraditionally all had the same power; but it was not much\ncompared to the absolute monarch. In 1789, the commoners\nwere dominated by educated merchants and large landowners\nwho advocated for establishing a British-style parliament as a\ncheck on the King\u2019s power.

On July 14th, these militias dramatically took over the\nBastille, a royal prison which held political dissidents. In August\nthe National Assembly agreed to a Declaration of the Rights of\nNatural Law\u201d as the basis\nMan which claimed \u201c\nfor equal rights for all and called for\nliberty, property, security, and\nresistance to oppression. Like the U.S.\nDeclaration of Independence and\nConstitution, the Assembly declared\nthe the \u201cnation\u201d was sovereign, rather\nthan the king, and asserted the rights\nof f\nreedom of speech, the press, religion, and assembly.\nHowever, the French Revolution differed from the American\nin that it was not a colonial independence movement, but a\nrejection of an existing monarchy by the people of France.\nThere was a much greater degree of participation by poor\npeople in France in this process, and the social changes\nattempted by the new government were much more significant\nthan simply replacing a British ruling class with an American\none as the revolution had done in the new United States.\nUnfortunately, the power vacuum created by the complete\nelimination of the prior government structure resulted in the\nrise of a radical Jacobin Party led by Maximillian Robespierre.\nBy 1793, a Reign of Terror imprisoned 300,000 people and Modern World History 153\nexecuted 40,000, including King Louis XVI and his Queen,\nMarie Antoinette.\nOne of the prisoners who just barely escaped with his life\nwas Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sense, who had been\nwelcomed as an honorary citizen of the new French Republic\nand had even been given a seat in their new legislative assembly.\nAlthough he had defended the French Revolution against\nBritish criticism in his book The Rights of Man, Paine was\nimprisoned for objecting to the execution of the French King\nand Queen. Paine was scheduled for execution, but was passed\nover in a lucky oversight. Other reformers like French feminist\nOlympe de Gouges were not so fortunate, and were killed by the\nrevolution they had supported.\nThe Execution of Maximillian Robespierre in July 1794 effectively ended the Reign of\nTerror.\nThe Reign of Terror led to a rejection of the Jacobin party\nand the trial and execution of Robespierre in 1794. A more\nconservative government, the Directory, was installed but it\nfailed to manage an orderly transition from the old regime to\na new style of republican government. The Directory\u2019s failure\ncreated an opening for an ambitious opportunist named\nNapoleon Bonaparte, who as a general of the French Army had 154 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndefended the Directory and the new French Republic against\nthe neighboring monarchies, which had sent in troops to put\ndown the Revolution. Returning from an Egyptian campaign in\n1799, Napoleon overthrew the Directory and like Julius Caesar\nestablished a 3-man Consul style government\u2014but unlike\nCaesar he quickly became the sole leader. Napoleon crowned\nhimself Emperor in 1802.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How was the French Revolution different from the American?\nOne advantage Napoleon\nhad establishing his empire,\nin addition to his effective use\nof the French army, was that\nhe was able to reinstate many\nmembers of the old nobility\nwho had been discredited or\neven imprisoned by the\nRevolution. He even allowed\naristocrats to reclaim some of\nthe property the\nrevolutionaries had taken\nfrom them. Napoleon also\nintroduced a new Civil Code\nin 1804 that completely\nrevamped the French legal\nsystem and is still in use\ntoday. The Code, designed by\n1803 portrait of Napoleon\na panel of four eminent\njudges, replaced France\u2019s old\nfeudal legal system and has been tremendously influential in\nEurope and elsewhere in the world as nations developed\nmodern legal systems.\nIn a series of wars between 1804 and 1807, Napoleon extended Modern World History 155\nFrench control to much of Germany, Italy, Spain, and the duchy\nof Warsaw, and built strong alliances with Austria and Prussia.\nAt its height, the French Empire ruled over 70 million subjects,\nand to secure its most profitable colony Napoleon sent 40,000\ntroops across the Atlantic to Hispaniola to try to retake San\nDominique from an army of rebellious former slaves led by\nToussaint l\u2019Ouverture, one of the most important leaders of the\nrevolutionary age.\nEncouraged by the French Revolution, slaves on sugar\nplantations on Hispaniola, which the French had renamed San\nDominique, rebelled in 1791 and overthrew the white\ngovernment of the island. Slavery in French colonies was then\nabolished by the Jacobins in 1793 (one of the few things\nRobespierre got right) and the army of former slaves fought a\nBritish invasion to a standstill in a 5-year war ending in 1798.\nBut after declaring himself Emperor of the French, Napoleon\nreinstituted slavery and sent troops to retake the island for\nFrance. 156 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nNapoleon\u2019s army, which\noutnumbered Haitian forces\ntwo to one, captured\nl\u2019Ouverture in 1803 and\ntransported him to a French\nprison where he died, but the\nrevolution continued under\nl\u2019Overture\u2019s lieutenant Jean-\nJacques Dessalines. The\nformer slaves defeated the\nFrench and established the\nRepublic of Haiti in 1804.\nAlthough the Declaration of\nIndependence\u2019s author\nThomas Jefferson was\nPresident when Haiti became\nthe first ever nation created\nby former slaves who gained\ntheir freedom in armed\nrebellion and only the second Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture, possibly reading the\nHaitian Declaration of Independence, ca.\nAmerican republic to free\n1801\nitself from European\ncolonialism, the author of the Declaration refused to recognize\nHaiti\u2019s independence. The slavery-supporting South actually\nblocked recognition of Haiti by the U.S. government until the\nCivil War, when a North-only Congress and President Lincoln\nfinally established diplomatic relations in 1862.\nAnother momentous act of Napoleon\u2019s was his sale of 828,000\nsquare miles of North America to the US in 1804. The expense\nof the failed war to prevent Haitian independence and the\nprospect of a new war with Britain convinced Napoleon to take\nfifty million francs (about $11 million today) for the territory\nit had just regained from Spain. President Thomas Jefferson\nhad originally been interested in buying only the city of New\nOrleans at the mouth of the Mississippi River, which was an\nimportant port where produce from the interior arrived via the\nMississippi. But the territory he acquired actually doubled the\nsize of the U.S. As you can see from this 1804 map, people\nliving on the east coast were aware how big North America was Modern World History 157\nbetween the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, if they\nwere a bit hazy about what lay between the Rockies and the\nPacific.\nRevolution and Nationalism are related, but the relationship\nis complicated. In the case of the United States and Haiti,\nrevolution led to the creation of new nations. In France,\nrevolution led to chaos and Napoleon\u2019s attempt at empire-\nbuilding. Napoleon\u2019s empire might have lasted a bit longer, if\nhe had not been so interested in expanding it to include not\nonly Europe and Haiti, but Russia. In a final example of bad\njudgment, Napoleon invaded Russia and occupied Moscow in 158 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSeptember 1812. Russia\u2019s fast-moving Cossack cavalry executed\na scorched-earth retreat before the advancing French army, so\nNapoleon\u2019s forces arrived in Moscow hungry, only to find that\nthe city\u2019s quarter-million people had abandoned their homes\nand taken everything they could carry. The French burned the\ncity (possibly by accident) and began a long retreat in early\nOctober at the beginning of what turned out to be a brutal\nwinter. To make matters worse, Russian cavalry repeatedly cut\nthe French supply lines, and of an original force of over\n600,000 men, only about 100,000 made it back to France alive.\nNapoleon was able to build the army back up again, although\nreplacing the horses the troops had eaten during the retreat was\nharder. But this crushing debacle proved to the world he wasn\u2019t\nthe military genius many had believed him to be.\nNapoleon\u2019s enemies invaded France in 1814, forced him to\nabdicate, and exiled him to Elba, a small island near his\nboyhood home of Corsica. Napoleon escaped the\nMediterranean island and regained power briefly in 1815 before\nbeing defeated at Waterloo and exiled to St. Helena in the South\nAtlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 159\n\u2022 Why was Napoleon willing to sell Louisiana to Thomas\nJefferson?\n\u2022 What prevented the U.S. government from recognizing Haiti?\nIndependence of Latin America\nNapoleon\u2019s conquest of Europe inadvertently created the\nconditions for additional revolutions and the creation of new\nnations in the Americas. As described in the last chapter,\nSpanish American society was based on a small aristocracy of\nethnic Spanish peninsulares (people born on the Iberian\npeninsula) and creoles (people of Spanish descent born in the\ncolonies) ruling large populations of mestizo (mixed)\npopulations, Indians, and slaves. Like the leaders of the\nAmerican Revolution, many of these colonial aristocrats felt\nthe priorities of their rulers in Spain did not match their own.\nNapoleon\u2019s removal of the hereditary king and installation of\nhis brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne in 1807\nremoved the last shred of doubt. Soon after Joseph Bonaparte\ntook the throne, representative juntas were established in\nCaracas, Santiago, Buenos Aires, and Bogota to rule in the name\nof the deposed Spanish king.\nIn 1810 a creole priest named Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla began\nMexico\u2019s revolutionary movement, by giving a speech known\nas the \u201cGrito de Dolores\u201d or simply El Grito, the Cry. Hidalgo\nraised an army of 100,000 men, largely of landless peasants\nanxious for social reform, but they were defeated in January\n1811 by a professional army of about 6,000 Spanish troops.\nHidalgo was convicted of treason against Spain and executed.\nAnother (this time mestizo) priest named Jos\u00e9 Maria Morelos\ntook over the insurrection and convened a Congress in 1813 that\nwrote a constitution for Mexico called the Decreto Constitucional\npara la Libertad de la America Mexica which declared Mexico\u2019s\nindependence. Unlike later independence movements in South\nAmerica, Mexico\u2019s demanded not just political but also social\nchange.\nIn 1815 Morelos was also captured and executed. His 160 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nlieutenant Vicente Guerrero continued the war for\nindependence. Guerrero would be elected president of Mexico\nin 1829 and would be Mexico\u2019s first black president. But it was a\nlong way to 1829.\nKing Ferdinand VII was the\nSpanish monarch who had\nbeen forced to abdicate in\n1808 in favor of Joseph\nBonaparte. He regained the\nthrone in 1813, but quickly\nbecame known as el Rey Fel\u00f3n,\nthe criminal king. Ferdinand\nrejected the liberal 1812\nConstitution that had been\nadopted by Spain\u2019s rebel\ngovernment during his\nabsence. Historians have\ndescribed him as \u201cthe basest\nking in Spanish history.\nCowardly, selfish, grasping,\nsuspicious, and vengeful, [he]\nKing Ferdinand VII of Spain, \u201cEl Rey Felon\u201d\nseemed almost incapable of\nany perception of the\ncommonwealth. He thought only in terms of his power and\nsecurity and was unmoved by the enormous sacrifices of\nSpanish people to retain their independence and preserve his\nthrone.\u201d Latin American juntas and the Mexican rebels decided\nhe did not deserve their allegiance and began fighting for their\nindependence from Spain.\nThe royal government sent a general named Agust\u00edn de\nIturbide against Guerrero\u2019s forces in Mexico, but Guerrero beat\nIturbide on the battlefield and then convinced him to join the\nrevolution. In 1821 the two allied under the Plan de Iguala, or\nthe \u201cPlan of the Three Guarantees,\u201d which proclaimed Mexico\u2019s\nindependence and declared that \u201cAll inhabitants . . . without\ndistinction of their European, African or Indian origins are\ncitizens . . . with full freedom to pursue their livelihoods\naccording to their merits and virtues.\u201d When Iturbide declared Modern World History 161\nhimself emperor of Mexico, Guerrero and his supporters\nrebelled and although Iturbide defeated them in the field he\nresigned when Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna also rebelled, and\nwent into exile. Mexican history is very complicated and\nturbulent: suffice it to say that both Iturbide and Guerrero ended\nup being executed in their turns.\nThe Abrazo, when Guerrero convinced Iturbide to join revolution.\nIn 1811 Venezuela and Paraguay both declared their\nindependence from Spain. In 1816 Argentina declared its\nindependence, followed quickly by Chile and Gran Colombia.\nKing Pedro of Portugal, whose father had fled to Brazil in 1807\nto avoid being deposed by Napoleon, declared Brazil a\nconstitutional empire under his rule in 1822. In 1824, the\nVenezuelan Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who had led the liberation of Gran\nColombia, conclusively defeated the Spanish armies at Jun\u00edn\nand Sucre, and Peru gained its independence. A year later the\neastern portion of the old viceroyalty of Peru became a separate\ncountry named after the liberator Bol\u00edvar: Bolivia. 162 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nGran Colombia was a\nrepublic that includes\nterritory now part of\nColombia, Venezuela,\nEcuador, Panama, northern\nPeru, western Guyana, and\nnorthwest Brazil. Bol\u00edvar was\nelected President of Gran\nColombia from 1819 to 1830.\nHe hoped Latin America\nwould follow the example of\nthe United States and create a\nfederal union of all the newly-\nindependent nations\u2014or at\nleast a common economic\nmarket. He convened a\nCongress of the Americas in\nPosthumous portrait of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. ca. the summer of 1826, inviting\n1860. all the nations of Latin\nAmerica and also the United\nStates. The U.S. President, John Quincy Adams, didn\u2019t have a\nvery high opinion of Latin Americans but he was an opponent\nof slavery and all of the new Spanish America republics had\nimmediately outlawed the slave trade and had either abolished\nslavery or had initiated its gradual disappearance through\nmanumission. (The independent Brazilian Empire, on the other\nhand, did not formally end enslavement of people of color until\n1888, the last nation in the Americas to do so). Adams had been\ninstrumental in promulgating the Monroe Doctrine in 1823,\nestablishing the Western Hemisphere as a region under the\nprotection of the US and warning European nations, especially\nGreat Britain, to limit their activities in the Americas.\nBritain, however, did attend the Congress of the Americas\nas an observer and managed to gain several important trade\ndeals as a result. But blocked once again by the slaveholding\nSouth, the U.S. government dragged its feet. Although the U.S.\nultimately decided to send a delegation, it arrived only after\nthe Congress had ended. Bol\u00edvar was unable to establish the\nPan-American commonwealth he had dreamed of or even hold Modern World History 163\nGran Colombia together. He resigned the presidency in the\nspring of 1830 and the republic dissolved into political chaos\nand the three separate nations of Venezuela, Colombia, and\nEcuador. Bol\u00edvar died of tuberculosis at age 47 later that year.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What was the significance of Mexico\u2019s 1821 Plan de Iguala?\n\u2022 How do you think history would have been different if Bol\u00edvar\nhad been successful in his plans for a United States of South\nAmerica?\nPrimary Source #1: U.S. Declaration of Independence\nIn Congress, July 4, 1776\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united\nStates of America, When in the Course of human events, it\nbecomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political\nbands which have connected them with another, and to\nassume among the powers of the earth, the separate and\nequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s\nGod entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\nrequires that they should declare the causes which impel\nthem to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\ncreated equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with\ncertain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty\nand the pursuit of Happiness.\u2013That to secure these rights,\nGovernments are instituted among Men, deriving their just\npowers from the consent of the governed, \u2013That whenever\nany Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,\nit is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and\nto institute new Government, laying its foundation on such\nprinciples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them\nshall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\nPrudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long 164 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nestablished should not be changed for light and transient\ncauses; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that\nmankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are\nsufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms\nto which they are accustomed. But when a long train of\nabuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object\nevinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism,\nit is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government,\nand to provide new Guards for their future security.\u2013Such has\nbeen the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is\nnow the necessity which constrains them to alter their former\nSystems of Government. The history of the present King of\nGreat Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,\nall having in direct object the establishment of an absolute\nTyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be\nsubmitted to a candid world.\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome\nand necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\nand pressing importance, unless suspended in their\noperation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so\nsuspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation\nof large districts of people, unless those people would\nrelinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a\nright inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\npublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into\ncompliance with his measures.\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for\nopposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of\nthe people.\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to\ncause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers,\nincapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\nfor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time\nexposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and\nconvulsions within. Modern World History 165\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these\nStates; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for\nNaturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to\nencourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions\nof new Appropriations of Lands.\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing\nhis Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the\ntenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their\nsalaries.\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither\nswarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their\nsubstance.\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and\nsuperior to the Civil power.\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\nforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\ngiving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for\nany Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of\nthese States:\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by\nJury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended\noffences\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a\nneighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary\ngovernment, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at\nonce an example and fit instrument for introducing the same\nabsolute rule into these Colonies:\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable 166 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nLaws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our\nGovernments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring\nthemselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases\nwhatsoever.\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of\nhis Protection and waging War against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our\ntowns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign\nMercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and\ntyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &\nperfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and\ntotally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on\nthe high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become\nthe executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall\nthemselves by their Hands.\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the\nmerciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an\nundistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for\nRedress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions\nhave been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose\ncharacter is thus marked by every act which may define a\nTyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish\nbrethren. We have warned them from time to time of\nattempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable\njurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the\ncircumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We\nhave appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and\nwe have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to\ndisavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt\nour connections and correspondence. They too have been\ndeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must,\ntherefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Modern World History 167\nSeparation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,\nEnemies in War, in Peace Friends.\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of\nAmerica, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the\nSupreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our\nintentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good\nPeople of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That\nthese United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free\nand Independent States; that they are Absolved from all\nAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political\nconnection between them and the State of Great Britain, is\nand ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and\nIndependent States, they have full Power to levy War,\nconclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and\nto do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\nof right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm\nreliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually\npledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred\nHonor.\nPrimary Source Supplement #2: The Haitian\nDeclaration of Independence, 1804\nThe Commander in Chief to the People of Haiti\nCitizens:\nIt is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have\nbloodied our land for two centuries; it is not enough to have\nrestrained those ever-evolving factions that one after another\nmocked the specter of liberty that France dangled before\nyou.

In the end we must live independent or\ndie.\nIndependence or death\u2026 let these sacred words unite us\nand be the signal of battle and of our reunion.\nCitizens, my countrymen, on this solemn day I have brought\ntogether those courageous soldiers who, as liberty lay dying,\nspilled their blood to save it; these generals who have guided\nyour efforts against tyranny have not yet done enough for\nyour happiness; the French name still haunts our land.\nEverything revives the memories of the cruelties of this\nbarbarous people: our laws, our habits, our towns, everything\nstill carries the stamp of the French. Indeed! There are still\nFrench in our island, and you believe yourself free and\nindependent of that Republic which, it is true, has fought all\nthe nations, but which has never defeated those who wanted\nto be free.\nWhat! Victims of our [own] credulity and indulgence for 14\nyears; defeated not by French armies, but by the pathetic\neloquence of their agents\u2019 proclamations; when will we tire\nof breathing the air that they breathe? What do we have\nin common with this nation of executioners? The difference\nbetween its cruelty and our patient moderation, its color and\nours the great seas that separate us, our avenging climate, all\ntell us plainly that they are not our brothers, that they never\nwill be, and that if they find refuge among us, they will plot\nagain to trouble and divide us.\nNative citizens, men, women, girls, and children, let your\ngaze extend on all parts of this island: look there for your\nspouses, your husbands, your brothers, your sisters. Indeed!\nLook there for your children, your suckling infants, what have\nthey become?\u2026 I shudder to say it \u2026 the prey of these\nvultures.\nInstead of these dear victims, your alarmed gaze will see\nonly their assassins, these tigers still dripping with their blood,\nwhose terrible presence indicts your lack of feeling and your\nguilty slowness in avenging them. What are you waiting for\nbefore appeasing their spirits? Remember that you had\nwanted your remains to rest next to those of your fathers,\nafter you defeated tyranny; will you descend into their tombs Modern World History 169\nwithout having avenged them? No! Their bones would reject\nyours.\nAnd you, precious men, intrepid generals, who, without\nconcern for your own pain, have revived liberty by shedding\nall your blood, know that you have done nothing if you do not\ngive the nations a terrible, but just example of the vengeance\nthat must be wrought by a people proud to have recovered\nits liberty and jealous to maintain it let us frighten all those\nwho would dare try to take it from us again; let us begin with\nthe French. Let them tremble when they approach our coast,\nif not from the memory of those cruelties they perpetrated\nhere, then from the terrible resolution that we will have made\nto put to death anyone born French whose profane foot soils\nthe land of liberty.\nWe have dared to be free, let us be thus by ourselves and\nfor ourselves. Let us imitate the grown child: his own weight\nbreaks the boundary that has become an obstacle to him.\nWhat people fought for us? What people wanted to gather\nthe fruits of our labor? And what dishonorable absurdity to\nconquer in order to be enslaved. Enslaved?\u2026 Let us leave this\ndescription for the French; they have conquered but are no\nlonger free.\nLet us walk down another path; let us imitate those people\nwho, extending their concern into the future, and dreading\nto leave an example of cowardice for posterity, preferred to\nbe exterminated rather than lose their place as one of the\nworld\u2019s free peoples.\nLet us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not\ndestroy our work; let us allow our neighbors to breathe in\npeace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have\nmade for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary\nfirebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean,\nnor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the\nneighboring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has\nnot been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants;\nthey have no vengeance to claim from the authority that\nprotects them.\nFortunate to have never known the ideals that have 170 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndestroyed us, they can only have good wishes for our\nprosperity.\nPeace to our neighbors; but let this be our cry: \u201cAnathama\nto the French name! Eternal hatred of France!\u201d\nNatives of Haiti! My happy fate was to be one day the\nsentinel who would watch over the idol to which you sacrifice;\nI have watched, sometimes fighting alone, and if I have been\nso fortunate as to return to your hands the sacred trust you\nconfided to me, know that it is now your task to preserve it. In\nfighting for your liberty, I was working for my own happiness.\nBefore consolidating it with laws that will guarantee your free\nindividuality, your leaders, who I have assembled here, and I,\nowe you the final proof of our devotion.\nGenerals and you, leaders, collected here close to me for\nthe good of our land, the day has come, the day which must\nmake our glory, our independence, eternal.\nIf there could exist among us a lukewarm heart, let him\ndistance himself and tremble to take the oath which must\nunite us. Let us vow to ourselves, to posterity, to the entire\nuniverse, to forever renounce France, and to die rather than\nlive under its domination; to fight until our last breath for the\nindependence of our country.\nAnd you, a people so long without good fortune, witness to\nthe oath we take, remember that I counted on your constancy\nand courage when I threw myself into the career of liberty\nto fight the despotism and tyranny you had struggled against\nfor 14 years. Remember that I sacrificed everything to rally to\nyour defense; family, children, fortune, and now I am rich only\nwith your liberty; my name has become a horror to all those\nwho want slavery. Despots and tyrants curse the day that I\nwas born. If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving\nthose laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for\nyour own good, you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful\npeople.

A sudden\nchange in the nation\u2019s fortune announced to Europe the\nregeneration that had been effected in the national\nrepresentation. But up to the very moment when I am\nspeaking, it must be agreed that we have been guided, amid\nsuch stormy circumstances, by the love of good and by the\nawareness of our country\u2019s needs rather than by an exact\ntheory and by precise rules of conduct, which we did not have\neven leisure enough to lay out.\nIt is time to mark clearly the goal of the revolution, and the\nend we want to reach; it is time for us to take account both of\nthe obstacles that still keep us from it, and of the means we\nought to adopt to attain it: a simple and important idea which\nseems never to have been noticed. . . .\nFor ourselves, we come today to make the world privy to\nyour political secrets, so that all our country\u2019s friends can 172 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nrally to the voice of reason and the public interest; so that\nthe French nation and its representatives will be respected in\nall the countries of the world where the knowledge of their\nreal principles can penetrate; so that the intriguers who seek\nalways to replace other intriguers will be judged by sure and\neasy rules.\nWe must take far-sighted precautions to return the destiny\nof liberty into the hands of the truth, which is eternal, rather\nthan into those of men, who are transitory, so that if the\ngovernment forgets the interests of the people, or if it lapses\ninto the hands of the corrupt individuals, according to the\nnatural course of things, the light of recognized principles will\nilluminate their treachery, and so that every new faction will\ndiscover death in the mere thought of crime. . .\nWhat is the goal toward which we are heading? The\npeaceful enjoyment of liberty and equality; the reign of that\neternal justice whose laws have been inscribed, not in marble\nand stone, but in the hearts of all men, even in that of the\nslave who forgets them and in that of the tyrant who denies\nthem.\nWe seek an order of things in which all the base and cruel\npassions are enchained, all the beneficent and generous\npassions are awakened by the laws; where ambition becomes\nthe desire to merit glory and to serve our country; where\ndistinctions are born only of equality itself; where the citizen\nis subject to the magistrate, the magistrate to the people, and\nthe people to justice; where our country assures the well-\nbeing of each individual, and where each individual proudly\nenjoys our country\u2019s prosperity and glory; where every soul\ngrows greater through the continual flow of republican\nsentiments, and by the need of deserving the esteem of a\ngreat people; where the arts are the adornments of the liberty\nwhich ennobles them and commerce the source of public\nwealth rather than solely the monstrous opulence of a few\nfamilies.\nIn our land we want to substitute morality for egotism,\nintegrity for formal codes of honor, principles for customs, a\nsense of duty for one of mere propriety, the rule of reason for\nthe tyranny of fashion, scorn of vice of scorn of the unlucky, Modern World History 173\nself-respect for insolence, grandeur of soul over vanity, love\nof glory for the love of money, good people in place of good\nsociety. We wish to substitute merit for intrigue, genius for\nwit, truth for glamour, the charm of happiness for sensuous\nboredom, the greatness of man for the pettiness of the great,\na people who are magnanimous, powerful, and happy, in\nplace of a kindly, frivolous, and miserable people \u2013 which is to\nsay all the virtues and all the miracles of the republic in place\nof all the vices and all the absurdities of the monarchy.\nWe want, in a word, to fulfill natures\u2019s desires, accomplish\nthe destiny of humanity, keep the promises of philosophy,\nabsolve providence from the long reign of crime and tyranny.\nLet France, formerly illustrious among the enslaved lands,\neclipsing the glory of all the free peoples who have existed,\nbecome the model for the nations, the terror of oppressors,\nthe consolation of the oppressed the ornament of the world \u2013\nand let us, in sealing our work with our blood, see at least the\nearly dawn of the universal bliss -that is our ambition, that is\nour goal.\nWhat kind of government can realize these wonders? Only a\ndemocratic or republican government \u2013 these two words are\nsynonyms, despite the abuses in common speech, because an\naristocracy is no closer than a monarchy to being a republic. .\n.\nDemocracy is a state in which the sovereign people, guided\nby laws which are of their own making, do for themselves all\nthat they can do well, and by their delegates do all that they\ncannot do for themselves. . . .\nNow, what is the fundamental principle of popular or\ndemocratic government, that is to say, the essential\nmainspring which sustains it and makes it move? It is virtue.\nI speak of the public virtue which worked so many wonders\nin Greece and Rome and which ought to produce even more\nastonishing things in republican France \u2013 that virtue which is\nnothing other than the love of the nation and its law.\nBut as the essence of the republic or of democracy is\nequality, it follows that love of country necessarily embraces\nthe love of equality. . .\nBut the French are the first people of the world who have 174 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nestablished real democracy, by calling all men to equality and\nfull rights of citizenship; and there, in my judgment, is the true\nreason why all the tyrants in league against the Republic will\nbe vanquished.\nThere are important consequences to be drawn\nimmediately from the principles we have just explained.\nSince the soul of the Republic is virtue, equality, and since\nyour goal is to found, to consolidate the Republic, it follows\nthat the first rule of your political conduct ought to be to\nrelate all your efforts to maintaining equality and developing\nvirtue; because the first care of the legislator ought to be to\nfortify the principle of the government. This everything that\ntends to excite love of country, to purify morals, to elevate\nsouls, to direct the passions of the human heart toward the\npublic interest, ought to be adopted or established by you.\nEverything which tends to concentrate them in the abjection\nof selfishness, to awaken enjoyment for petty things and\nscorn for great ones, ought to be rejected or curbed by you.\nWithin the scheme of the French revolution, that which is\nimmoral is impolitic, that which is corrupting is counter-\nrevolutionary. Weakness, vice, and prejudices are the road to\nroyalty. . .\nWe deduce from all this a great truth \u2013 that the\ncharacteristic of popular government is to be trustful towards\nthe people and severe towards itself.\nHere the development of our theory would reach its limit, if\nyou had only to steer the ship of the Republic through calm\nwaters. But the tempest rages, and the state of the revolution\nin which you find yourselves imposes upon you another task.\n. . .\nWe must smother the internal and external enemies of the\nRepublic or perish with them. Now, in this situation, the first\nmaxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason\nand the people\u2019s enemies by terror.\nIf the mainspring of popular government in peacetime is\nvirtue, amid revolution it is at the same time [both] virtue\nand terror: virtue, without which terror is fatal; terror, without\nwhich virtue is impotent. Terror is nothing but prompt,\nsevere, inflexible justice; it is therefore an emanation of Modern World History 175\nvirtue. It is less a special principle than a consequence of the\ngeneral principle of democracy applied to our country\u2019s most\npressing needs.\nIt has been said that terror was the mainspring of despotic\ngovernment. Does your government, then, resemble a\ndespotism? Yes, as the sword which glitters in the hands of\nliberty\u2019s heroes resembles the one with which tyranny\u2019s\nlackeys are armed. Let the despot govern his brutalized\nsubjects by terror; he is right to do this, as a despot. Subdue\nliberty\u2019s enemies by terror, and you will be right, as founders\nof the Republic. The government of the revolution is the\ndespotism of liberty against tyranny. Is force made only to\nprotect crime? And is it not to strike the heads of the proud\nthat lightning is destined? . . .\nTo punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency; to\npardon them is barbarity. The rigor of tyrants has only rigor\nfor a principle; the rigor of the republican government comes\nfrom charity.\nTherefore, woe to those who would dare to turn against the\npeople the terror which ought to be felt only by its enemies!\nWoe to those who, confusing the inevitable errors of civic\nconduct with the calculated errors of perfidy, or with\nconspirators\u2019 criminal attempts, leave the dangerous schemer\nto pursue the peaceful citizen! Perish the scoundrel who\nventures to abuse the sacred name of liberty, or the\nredoubtable arms which liberty has entrusted to him, in order\nto bring mourning or death into patriots\u2019 hearts! This abuse\nhas existed, one cannot doubt it. It has been exaggerated,\nno doubt, by the aristocracy. But if in all the Republic there\nexisted only one virtuous man persecuted by the enemies\nof liberty, the government\u2019s duty would be to seek him out\nvigorously and give him a dazzling revenge. . .\nHow frivolous it would be to regard a few victories achieved\nby patriotism as the end of all our dangers. Glance over our\ntrue situation. You will become aware that vigilance and\nenergy are more necessary for you than ever. An\nunresponding ill-will everywhere opposes the operations of\nthe government. The inevitable influence of foreign courts is\nno less active for being more hidden, and no less baneful. One 176 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsenses that crime, frightened, has only covered its tracks with\ngreater skill. . .\nYou could never have imagined some of the excesses\ncommitted by hypocritical counter-revolutionaries in order to\nblight the cause of the revolution. Would you believe that in\nthe regions where superstition has held the greatest sway,\nthe counter-revolutionaries are not content with burdening\nreligious observances under all the forms that could render\nthem odious, but have spread terror among the people by\nsowing the rumor that all children under ten and all old men\nover seventy are going to be killed? This rumor was spread\nparticularly through the former province of Brittany and in\nthe departments of the Rhine and the Moselle. It is one of the\ncrimes imputed to [Schneider] the former public prosecutor\nof the criminal court of Strasbourg. That man\u2019s tyrannical\nfollies make everything that has been said of Caligula and\nHeliogabalus [cruel Roman emperors] credible; one can\nscarcely believe it, despite the evidence. He pushed his\ndelirium to the point of commandeering women for his own\nuse \u2013 we are told that he even employed that method in\nselecting a wife. Whence came this sudden swarm of\nforeigners, priests, noble, intriguer of all kinds, which at the\nsame instant spread over the length and breadth of the\nRepublic, seeking to execute, in the name of philosophy, a\nplan of counter-revolution which has only been stopped by\nthe force of public reason? Execrable conception, worthy of\nthe genius of foreign courts leagued against liberty, and of the\ncorruption of all the internal enemies of the Republic! . . .\nIn deceitful hands all the remedies for our ills turn into\npoisons. Everything you can do, everything you can say, they\nwill turn against you, even the truths which we come here to\npresent this very day. . . .\nSuch an internal situation ought to seem to you worthy of\nall your attention, above all if you reflect that at the same time\nyou have the tyrants of Europe to combat, a million and two\nhundred thousand men under arms to maintain, and that the\ngovernment is obliged continually to repair, with energy and\nvigilance, all the injuries which the innumerable multitude of\nour enemies has prepared for us during the course of five\nyears. Modern World History 177\nWhat is the remedy for all these evils? We know no other\nthan the development of that general motive force of the\nRepublic \u2013 virtue.\nDemocracy perishes by two kinds of excess: either the\naristocracy of those who govern, or else the popular scorn\nfor the authorities whom the people themselves have\nestablished, scorn which makes each clique, each individual\ntake unto himself the public power and bring the people\nthrough excessive disorders, to annihilation or to the power\nof one man.\nThe double task of the moderates and the false\nrevolutionaries is to toss us back and forth perpetually\nbetween these two perils.\nBut the people\u2019s representatives can avoid them both,\nbecause government is always the master at being just and\nwise; and, when it has that character, it is sure of the\nconfidence of the people.\nIt is indeed true that the goal of all our enemies is to\ndissolve the Convention. It is true that the tyrant of Great\nBritain and his allies promise their parliament and subjects\nthat they will deprive you of your energy and of the public\nconfidence which you have merited; that is the fist instruction\nfor all their agents. . . .\nWe are beginning a solemn debate upon all the objects\nof its [the Convention\u2019s] anxiety, and everything that can\ninfluence the progress of the revolution. We adjure it not to\npermit any particular hidden interest to usurp ascendancy\nhere over the general will of the assembly and the\nindestructible power of reason.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 4863003 \u00a9 Mathew Carey is licensed under a CC BY\n(Attribution) license\n\u2022 lossy-page1-1920px-Description-de-l\u2019entree-Du-Roy-\net-de-la-Reyne-Paris_MG_1114.tif \u00a9 Abraham van\nDiepenbeeck is licensed under a Public Domain license 178 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 The_execution_of_King_Charles_I_from_NPG \u00a9\nDcoetzee is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Mapstaug \u00a9 Baptista Boazio is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 The_Trapper\u2019s_Bride \u00a9 Alfred Jacob Miller is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Cotton_Mather \u00a9 Peter Pelham is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Philip_King_of_Mount_Hope_by_Paul_Revere \u00a9\nPaul Revere is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Herna\u0301n_Corte\u0301s_(Meister_von_Saldana) \u00a9 Meister von\nSaldana is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Spanish_America_XVIII_Century_(Most_Expansion)\n\u00a9 Jluisrs is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Mestiso_1770 \u00a9 Crist\u00f3bal Lozano is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 download \u00a9 Richard Ligon is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 2880px-Slaveshipposter_(cropped) \u00a9 Plymouth\nChapter of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the\nSlave Trade is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 1713_Asiento_contract \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 The_Mill_Yard_-\n_Ten_Views_in_the_Island_of_Antigua_(1823),_plate\n_V_-_BL \u00a9 William Clark is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 Battle_for_Palm_Tree_Hill \u00a9 January Suchodolski is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Portrait_of_Thomas_Paine \u00a9 Laurent Dabos is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Boston_Tea_Party_Currier_colored \u00a9 Nathaniel\nCurrier is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 1920px-Map_of_territorial_growth_1775.svg \u00a9 Cg- Modern World History 179\nrealms is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Tory_Refugees_by_Howard_Pyle \u00a9 Howard Pyle is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 2880px-Execution_robespierre,_saint_just\u2026 \u00a9\nUnknown is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres,_Portrait_de_Napol\ne\u0301on_Bonaparte_en_premier_consul \u00a9 Jean Auguste\nDominique Ingres is licensed under a Public Domain\nlicense\n\u2022 Ge\u0301ne\u0301ral_Toussaint_Louverture \u00a9 Unknown is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 2044px-Louisiana1804a \u00a9 Samuel Lewis is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Night_Bivouac_of_Great_Army \u00a9 Vasily Vereshchagin\nis licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Francisco_Goya_-\n_Portrait_of_Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain_in_his_robes_\nof_state_(1815)_-_Prado \u00a9 Francisco Goya is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Abrazo_de_Acatempan \u00a9 Ram\u00f3n Sagredo is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 1920px-\nEl_Libertador_(Boli\u0301var_diploma\u0301tico)_1860_000 \u00a9\nAita (pseudonym of Rita Matilde de la Pe\u00f1uela) is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license [5]\nTroubled Nineteenth Century\nThe boundaries set in Europe by the Congress of Vienna, 1815.\n180 Modern World History 181\nLiberalism and the Revolutions of 1848\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon a second time at Waterloo in 1815,\nEurope breathed a sigh of relief. The British, who had led the\ndefense against his final invasion, chose St. Helena in the South\nAtlantic as a permanent home for the exiled Emperor.\nNapoleon was transported to the island, which was administered\nby the East India Company, in 1815 and lived there for the rest\nof his life. He died in 1821, at 51.\nAt the Congress of Vienna, which ran from November 1814\nthrough June 1815, the old ruling families of Europe got together\nto try to restore what they thought of as peace and order. To\na large extent their priority was trying to restore the status quo\nante: the borders that had existed before Napoleon\u2019s conquests\nand the types of social organization that had prevailed before\nthe French Revolution. The brother of the executed King, Louis\nXVI, took the French throne as Louis XVIII (the XVIIth Louis\nhad been the dead king\u2019s son, who had died in prison at the age\nof 10 in 1795); the restored king agreed to return the territories\nNapoleon had conquered to the nations that had held them\npreviously. As much as possible, the Congress of Vienna tried to\nturn back the clock and forget that the Revolution and Napoleon\nhad ever happened, while setting up a balance of power to check 182 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthe possibility of a French imperial resurgence A European-\nwide peace would hold until World War One began in 1914.\nBeginning in 1838, \u201cChartists\u201d in Great Britain demanded an extension of suffrage to all\nmen over 21, along with other political reforms. Their protests were sometimes\nsuppressed violently by the police. In addition to throwing rocks, apparently the\nChartists also launched the occasional cat at the club-wielding bobbies.\nBut too much had changed to return to the past. Liberals tried\nto distance themselves from the social leveling and economic\nredistribution the Jacobins had attempted, identifying instead\nwith ideas like free trade and a limited franchise. But radicals\npushed for greater equality and more rights for regular people.\nFor instance, British workers agitated for the right to vote and\nfor a social contract called the People\u2019s Charter in the 1830s\nand 40s, but conservative Tories blocked the Chartists.\nEnlightenment-inspired ideas about democracy, popular\nsovereignty, and new ideas like socialism all came to a head in\nEurope by 1848, which was known as the Year of Revolutions.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were European rulers so eager to return to the\nconditions before the French Revolution? Modern World History 183\nImmigration to the United States\nThe Irish Famine, caused\nby a blight that rendered\npotatoes inedible, began in\n1845. Potatoes had proved to\nbe an ideal crop for Ireland,\nand it produced enough of\nthe crop for itself and most of\nthe rest of British\nIsles\u2014losing this important\nfood source was disastrous for\nthe Irish peasants. British\ngovernment aid proved\nincompetent and ineffective,\nrevealing a scandalous level of\nprejudice against the Catholic\nIrish, the first colonized\npeople of the British Crown\nAn image of the Irish Famine published in\nOver a million people in\n1849 in the Illustrated London News.\nIreland died because of the\nFamine, and a million more to emigrated to avoid\nstarvation\u2014mostly to the U.S. The population of Ireland, which\nhad been more than 8 million in 1841, never recovered (and is\nstill only about 4.7 million today). Food shortages spread to\nScotland and central Europe, where the Czech potato harvest\nwas also reduced by half because of the blight.\nIn addition to rural famines, a lot of Britain and parts of\nEurope had begun to industrialize, and poor urban workers\nwere dissatisfied with their wages and living conditions, which\nwill be described below. In 1848, rebels temporarily took\ncontrol of Vienna and forced the Austro-Hungarian Empire to\nend serfdom. Southern Italians revolted against the French still\noccupying their homeland. And a revolution in France ended\nthe monarchy once again and created the Second French\nRepublic. Although revolutionary movements in the German\nstates were unsuccessful in changing their governments, they 184 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\npaved the way for change and resulted in massive German\nimmigration to the US.\nMigration to the US had been slow between the end of the\nAmerican Revolution and the War of 1812, due to ongoing\ntensions with Britain and the Napoleonic conflicts in Europe.\nBut beginning in the 1830s and 1840s, immigration from\nEurope exploded, and the United States became a \u201csafety valve\u201d\nfor the underemployed, politically marginalized, and\npersecuted of Europe. The Irish in the 1840s were followed by\nGermans after 1848, who remain the largest single immigrant\ngroup. Scandinavians began arriving after the Civil War, and\nbut by the 1890s, most new immigrants came from southern\nEurope (especially Italians) and from eastern Europe\u2014including\nlarge numbers of persecuted Jews from the Russian Empire.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the majority of Americans\nwere of German ethnicity. Even today, 46 million Americans\nare of German descent (light blue on the map). The rest of the\ntop five ethnicities are Black or African American (38 million,\nmagenta, Mexican (34 million, pink), Irish (33 million, dark\npurple), English (24 million, light purple). This population count\nis complicated by the region in the southeast, stretching from\nthe Appalachian Mountains to northern Texas, where the largest Modern World History 185\ngroup calls itself \u201cAmerican\u201d and people do not attribute their\norigin to any foreign nation. These 22 million people are\nprobably mostly of English or Scotch-Irish descent, based on\nthe history of the region. Statewide, the German pluralities\nrange from 11% in Florida to 43% in North Dakota, which\nexplains why the capital is named after Prussian Chancellor\nOtto von Bismarck.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why was the US considered a \u201csafety valve\u201d for excess\nEuropean population?\n\u2022 Could a large population of \u201chyphenated\u201d Americans with\nsome connection to their original country pose a problem?\nThe Industrial Revolution\nSocial changes in Europe and America are a direct result of the\nIndustrial Revolution \u2013 as are many of the changes in the less\ndeveloped world we will discuss in a later chapter. So before\nwe look at the rest of the world, let\u2019s look more closely at\nindustrialization.\nThe last two hundred years of human history is also the story\nof the Industrial Revolution and its affects. The life of a peasant\nliving in France, Mexico, China, India, or Ethiopia in 1100 CE\nwas not that different from that of a similar peasant living in\nthe same place 200 years earlier or later. But, because of\ntechnology, industrialization, and urbanization, today\u2019s world is\nconsiderably different today than it was 200 years ago. In fact,\nthe change has accelerated: we live much differently than our\nparents did when they were our age. Consider how many of you\nmay be reading this on a hand-held electronic device, which\nwere not all that common even ten years ago. The acceleration\nof life in many aspects is just one of the results of the 186 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nunprecedented worldwide technological innovations of the last\ntwo centuries.\nEven today, there are five necessary inputs that are required\nfor industrialization: capital, technology, an energy source,\navailability of labor, and consumers. By the late 1700s, Great\nBritain had all of these and became the birthplace of the\nindustrial revolution. Continental Europe and the United States\nsoon followed.\nBut, why Great Britain?\nCapital\u2014wealth that is\ninvested to create more\nwealth\u2014was available to\nmerchants and others who\nbenefitted from world trade.\nThe British dominated the\nslave trade and the\ncorresponding cultivation of\nTextiles were the leading industry of the\nIndustrial Revolution, and mechanized sugar during the 18th century,\nfactories, powered by a central water wheel and those involved in the\nor steam engine, were the new workplace.\ntrade accumulated great\nwealth. Furthermore, the East India Company was also a source\nof capital through their trade with South Asia in tea and textiles.\nThe Company also was the model for a successful joint-stock\ncompany, in which individual investors purchased shares,\nwhich spread ownership and limited financial liability, allowing\nfor greater risk-taking. Soon, factories would be following the\nsame joint-stock model in order to accumulate the necessary\ncapital for investment.\nNew technology also made mass production possible, which\nfirst occurred in the British textile industry. The spinning jenny\nand power looms increased the efficiency of spinning wool and\ncotton, and then weaving the thread and yarn into cloth. From\nthis beginning, inventors began seeing the possibilities of\nmechanical production in other areas such as processed foods,\nclothing, paper, and household items. Even today, countries\nusually begin on the path to industrialization through the textile\nand processed food industries.\nGreat Britain also had abundant energy sources to power the Modern World History 187\nmachines. Like flour mills, textile mills initially used the power\nof rivers to spin water wheels and turbines connected to\nspinning and weaving machines. Later, the development of an\nefficient coal-fired steam engine by Scottish the engineer James\nWatt made it possible to locate factories closer to cities,\ntransportation hubs, workers, and consumers. Both water and\ncoal are still important sources of energy throughout the world.\nAgricultural improvements in the previous century and the\nintroduction of new staple crops like the potato, imported from\nthe Americas, produced more food using less labor. Improved\nnutrition allowed Britain\u2019s population to grow, increasing the\nnumber of people available for work in the factories. With a\nlarger population involved in a wage economy, producing goods\nfor others and not for themselves, Great Britain also created\nconsumers for the textiles, foods, and other products\nmanufactured in new factories. Soon, British merchants were\nselling industrial products to Continental Europe and to an\nincreasingly important market of consumers in Britain\u2019s\ncolonies. The ability to sell manufactured goods to a \u201ccaptive\u201d\ncolonial market added to the rush for overseas empires by the\nEuropean powers, the United States, and Japan in the 19th and\nearly 20th centuries. Every nation wanted consumers for the\nproducts of the \u201chome country\u201d and wanted to lock up the\nvaluable natural resources needed by the industries of the\nempire.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 What were Great Britain\u2019s main advantages that allowed it to\ndominate the early industrial revolution? 188 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Industrial Revolution\nsaw a gradual transition from\nhandicrafts made in the home\nor in small shops to\nmanufactures produced in\nfactories, which in itself\ncaused social and economic\ndisruption\u2014and\nimprovement\u2014among\nordinary workers and their\nfamilies. In early America, for\nHand-spinning yarn to make \u201chomespun\u201d\nclothing. example, a regular part of\nwomen\u2019s work was spinning\nthread and yarn from wool, flax, or cotton at home, then\nweaving cloth and making \u201chomespun\u201d clothing for their\nfamilies. This was hard, slow work, and took up a lot of women\u2019s\ntime. As soon as they were able to buy cloth from textile mills,\nwomen took advantage of the opportunity to devote much\nmore of their time to other tasks around the farmstead. Often,\nthey began market gardening or keeping an extra cow and\nchurning butter to earn \u201cpin money.\u201d Pins were an example of a\nmanufactured product farm families needed that could not be\nmade on the farm. Pins and other such necessities were usually\nsupplied by peddlers who walked across the countryside in the\ndays before easy access to stores, and then later by general\nstorekeepers.\nThe other side of handicraft\nmanufacture, though, was the\ntype of work done by the\nHuguenot\nweavers\u2014descendants of\nrefugee French\nProtestants\u2014in East London.\nThis was a whole community\nof people who specialized in\nweaving using tools and\nLuddites breaking a jacquard loom.\ntechniques that were available\nbefore the advent of large-scale textile mills. They were put out Modern World History 189\nof business by the more efficient manufacturing systems that\nwent along with the new technology, but they did not give up\nwithout a fight. Many became \u201cLuddites,\u201d part of a movement of\nhandicraft workers that secretly entered factories and destroyed\nmachinery, blaming the fictional \u201cNed Ludd\u201d for the acts of\nsabotage (a word that refers to the wooden clogs workers wore in\nFrance, which they would throw into the machinery to break it).\nGovernments were quick to crack down on Luddites \u2013 a couple\nof executions quickly took the wind out of their sails.\nAs mentioned above, industrialization was possible because\nfarms were producing high yields in the early 19th century,\ncreating both an available workforce and a consumer market\nfor many of the products of early industry. In addition, nations\nlike Britain with colonies had another lucrative market for\nmanufactures. Even after the American Revolution and the War\nof 1812, the United States remained a supplier of raw materials\nlike grain, timber, cotton, and salted pork to the former \u201chome\ncountry.\u201d In return, Britain shipped its manufactured goods to\nports like New York, where they were carried inland on the Erie\nCanal, and New Orleans, where they made their way up the\nMississippi River to the interior. Britain also cultivated trade\nrelationships with other new nations like those of Latin\nAmerica. British representatives like the envoy sent to Sim\u00f3n\nBol\u00edvar\u2019s Congress of the Americas worked hard to convince\nthese new nations not to go to the expense of trying to develop\ntheir own industries but instead to ship raw materials to Britain\nin exchange for cheap consumer goods from British factories.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why might \u201cLuddites\u201d or others oppose industrialization?\n\u2022 What were the advantages of industrial production? 190 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe role of governments in\nindustrialization should not\nbe overlooked. Official British\ntrade missions argued the\nbenefits of \u201cfree trade\u201d now\nthat Britain\u2019s manufacturers\nhad gained the advantage in\nproducing low-cost goods.\nBut the devotion to free\nmarkets championed by\nAdam Smith and his disciples\nwas new-found. When\ninexpensive cotton calicoes\nfrom India in the 1720s had\nbegun to be preferred for\nmaking English clothing, the\ndomestic wool industry had\nPortrait of Adam Smith, 1790 pressured Parliament into\npassing the Calico Acts to\nprohibit their import. But later, when the British textile industry\nbegan using technology that gave Britain an advantage in cotton\ncloth production, the government did not consider the\ncomplaints of the East London weavers, and even took steps to\nprotect trade secrets and prevent too rapid a technology transfer\nto help British industry profit on its innovations. Britain began\nproducing cotton cloth even more inexpensively than\nIndia\u2014and suddenly the British began preaching about \u201cfree\ntrade\u201d and pushing to erase any tariffs or regulations that might\nprevent British textiles from dominating world markets.\nThe governments of Continental Europe and the United\nStates quickly tired of simply being a source of raw materials\nfor British factories and a market for British goods. To support\neconomic development, these governments began taxing\nimports with tariffs to protect emerging industries from a flood\nof British manufactured goods. Tariffs increased the price of\nimports to consumers, encouraging them to buy the now-\ncompetitive domestically-produced goods. Protection from\nforeign competition has helped many fledgling industries get\noff the ground in developing nations. However, if industries Modern World History 191\nremain protected, they may have less incentive to become\ninternationally competitive in price or quality. Governments\nthat choose to constantly raise tariffs run the risk of subsidizing\ntheir industries\u2019 inefficiencies and reducing the welfare of their\nconsumers as industrial improvements in other countries lower\nthe price of imported products.\nTransportation, Steam Power, and Interchangeable Parts\nMost histories begin the Industrial Revolution with steam\nengines and many mention that by the 1820s steam-powered\nlooms had displaced the hand weavers in the cotton industry.\nThis description actually misses a whole generation of\ninnovation and growth when textile mills were powered by\nwater. The Scottish textile factories of New Lanark, for example,\nwere begun in 1786 by David Dale using water-power\ntechnology developed by Richard Arkwright in the 1770s. New\nLanark was built on the Clyde River in Scotland, and all of\nits machines were powered by the river until the mills closed\nin 1968. The American textile mills in New England that\ndominated the world market in the second half of the 19th\ncentury also used water power. The men who started the Boston\nManufacturing Company, that built the cities of Lowell and\nLawrence in Massachusetts to take advantage of the water power\nof the Merrimack River, visited New Lanark in 1811 to learn the\ntechnology before they began their venture. 192 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Clyde River and New Lanark in 2009\nRobert Owen and his partners had bought the mills in 1799\nfrom David Dale, Owen\u2019s father-in-law. Sensitive to the negative\nsocial changes that industrial growth had brought to other parts\nof Britain, Owen built schools for the children of his workers\nand social organizations for the families. He put an end to the\nlong-standing custom of forcing workers to buy only from the\ncompany store and tried to make New Lanark a real, living\ntown. Owen\u2019s partners had objected to his philanthropy,\nclaiming that healthy, happy, well-educated workers did not\nreally boost the bottom line. Rather than fight with them, Owen\nsimply bought his partners out.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What are the pros and cons of tariffs?\n\u2022 Why would an industrialist like Robert Owen be concerned\nabout his workers\u2019 social welfare? Modern World History 193\nThe present route of the Erie Canal, which is pretty close to its original route.\nThe initial expansion of transportation networks for mass-\nproduction industries was also water-based. In industrializing\ncountries, canal-building became a craze from the 1820s\nthrough the 1840s. Many local canals connected newly-\nestablished towns and villages to markets all over the United\nStates, Great Britain, and continental Europe. The Erie Canal in\nNew York State, for instance, connected Buffalo, on Lake Erie,\nto Albany, where the canal met the Hudson River, navigable\nall the way to New York City. Over 350 miles (580 kilometers)\nlong when completed in 1825, the Erie Canal included thirty-six\nlocks to ease barges down a gradual decline of more than 550\nfeet (170 meters). As agricultural goods shipped down the Canal\neventually made their way to markets in industrializing East\nCoast cities, pioneers established farms all along the Canal, and\nthe Erie Canal was key to the western settlement and expansion\nof the United States, especially before 1865. Canal laborers were\nfrequently Irish immigrants, who often settled nearby, once the\ncanal was built.\nSteam power soon became extremely important in\ntransportation, as well. Until steam engines were put on\nriverboats, shipping had depended on either wind and river\ncurrents or on human and animal power on canal towpaths.\nGoods could easily be floated south from farms on America\u2019s\nrivers for example, but it was much more difficult and expensive\nto ship products against the currents to the frontier. Flatboats\nand rafts accumulated at downstream ports such as New Orleans\nand were often broken down and burned as firewood. Steam\nengines made it possible to sail upstream as easily and quickly as 194 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndown, causing an explosion of travel and shipping that radically\nchanged frontier life. Ocean-going steamships made travel and\nshipping quicker and safer and allowed travelers and merchants\nto keep to regular schedules.\nSteam engines were a\nproduct of early European\nindustrialism. The first steam\npatent was granted to a\nSpanish inventor named\nJer\u00f3nimo Beaumont in 1606,\nwhose engine drove a pump\nused to drain mines. The\n\u201cConsternation at the sight of Fulton\u2019s French scientist Papin built\nmonster,\u201d from an 1870 story of the his steam piston in 1630 after\nClermont\u2019s first voyage up the Hudson\nvisiting the Royal Society in\nRiver.\nLondon and Englishman\nJames Watt\u2019s 1781 engine was the first to produce rotary power\nthat could be adapted to drive mills, wheels, and propellers.\nRobert Fulton, an American inventor who had previously\npatented a canal-dredging machine, visited Paris and caught\nsteam fever. Fulton sailed an experimental steamboat model on\nthe Seine, and then returned home and launched the first\ncommercial American steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807.\nThe Clermont was able to sail upriver 150 miles from New York\nCity to Albany in 32 hours. In 1811, Fulton built the New Orleans\nin Pittsburgh and began regular steamboat service on the\nMississippi.\nThe other transportation technology enabled by steam power,\nof course, was the railroad, which was even more revolutionary\nthan the steamboat. In spite of their power and speed, steam-\npowered riverboats depended on rivers or occasionally on\ncanals to run, but a railroad could be built almost anywhere.\nSuddenly, the expansion of commerce was no longer limited by\nthe routes nature had provided into the frontier. Modern World History 195\nSmall railroads using horses\nwere already common in\nmining operations in Great\nBritain and Europe before the\nadvent of steam power. The\nfirst railroads in the United\nStates had actually been built\non the East Coast before a\nsteam engine was available to\npower them. Trains of cars\n1831 newspaper illustration of a\npulled by horses looked a lot\nlocomotive (likely the Tom Thumb) in\nlike stage-coaches on rails. Baltimore.\nBut after Englishman George\nStephenson\u2019s locomotives began pulling passengers and freight\nin northwestern England in the mid-1820s, Americans quickly\nswitched to steam. The first locomotive used to pull cars in the\nUnited States was the Tom Thumb, built in 1830 for the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad. Although Tom Thumb lost its\nmaiden race against a horse-drawn train, Baltimore and Ohio\nowners were convinced by the demonstration of steam\ntechnology and committed to developing steam locomotives.\nThe B&O railroad, which had been established in 1827 to\ncompete with the Erie Canal, already advertised itself as a faster\nway to move people and freight from the interior to the coast.\nAdding steam engines accelerated rail\u2019s advantage over canal\nand river shipping.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were canals and steam power so transformative?\n\u2022 What was the advantage of railroads over steamships?\nFactories housed machinery that was too large or too\nexpensive to be used in home production, or that used power\nsources like steam or water power that weren\u2019t available to\nsmall-scale producers. The machines themselves usually 196 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndisplaced workers, like when the water-powered looms of New\nLanark destroyed the careers of hand-loom weavers by\nproducing large quantities of cloth at a low cost the weavers\ncouldn\u2019t match. However, the new industries also created new\njobs. And often, although it took fewer people to weave a given\namount of cloth using the new technology, the new industries\nwere usually producing products for much larger (sometimes\neven global) markets. So much cloth was made in the new\nindustrial textile centers like New Lanark in Scotland or Lowell\nin America that there were often a lot of new jobs \u2013 sometimes\nmore than had previously been available in that region.\nThe new factory jobs required less skill than artisanal\ncraftwork, especially when the worker was making a larger\nnumber of standardized products. Previously, a carpenter\nneeded to be a skilled craftsman to design and assemble a\ncustom-built chair, but with industrialization, a less-skilled lathe\noperator could turn large quantities of legs that could be\nassembled into any number of chairs of a standard pattern.\nWorkers doing lower-skilled jobs became as standardized as the\nthings they made, and could be employed at a much lower\ncost. While more people might be working in a new factory\ncompared to an old-fashioned craft workshop, each worker\u2019s\nwages would almost always be lower.\nAnd starting a factory was not the same as starting a craft\nworkshop. It was no longer a slow organic process where an\napprentice became a master craftsman, developed a clientele,\nopened his own business, then hired a few workers or\napprentices of his own. The people who started factories were\noften not even experts at the process they were going to do\n\u2013 they were capitalists and investors who had access to the\nlarge sums of money needed to erect a factory and fill it with\ntechnology and workers. A class of owners grew, who had little\nor no connection to the workers they employed. Modern World History 197\n\u201cFirst cotton gin\u201d from Harpers Weekly. 1869 illustration depicting the cotton gin\u2019s first\nuse 70 years earlier.\nAmerican inventor Eli Whitney (1765-1825) is remembered for\nthe cotton gin, which removed the seeds from cotton fiber\nmuch more quickly than they could be picked out by hand.\nThe cotton gin helped propel the American South into world\nleadership in raw cotton. By the 1850s, American plantations\nsupplied 80 to 90% of the world cotton market. But Whitney\u2019s\nmost important contribution to industrialization was his\ntechnique for using machine tools to produce interchangeable\nparts for firearms. With Whitney\u2019s standardized, machined\nparts, it no longer took a skilled gunsmith to build a weapon.\nAnybody with basic skills could assemble and also disassemble,\nrepair, and maintain a rifle or handgun. Weapons became more\nreliable and the technique was quickly applied to other\nindustries. Of course, since most of the intelligence in the job\nhad been moved into the machine, the machine gradually\nbecame more valuable and the machine operator less.\nWhitney\u2019s process made guns more reliable and less expensive,\nbut he turned not only the gun parts into interchangeable parts,\nbut also the factory employees themselves. The process\ncontinues today: in the Tesla car factory, robots running 198 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsophisticated software do most of the skilled tasks like welding,\nwhile a smaller number of human workers spend most of their\ntime moving assemblies from place to place and programming\nthe robots.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How does technology affect workers and their jobs?\nSocialism: Addressing the Negative Effects of Industrialization\nAlthough it produced quality products at low prices for a\ngrowing consumer market, industrialization disrupted the lives\nof workers. Since jobs were in factory towns and cities, people\nmoved from rural areas to growing metropolitan areas. The\nchange was often very abrupt for those who migrated: they lost\nthe slower rhythms of agricultural life to the time clock and\nsubway schedules of the accelerated industrialized world.\nAdditionally, people were cut off from communities in which\nthey had lived for generations, and forced to find new social\nrelations\u2014or fall into lonely and desperate lives. Although jobs\nwere the attraction for the new migrants, there was no guarantee\nof permanent positions in the new economy. Financial cycles\nof boom and bust affected urban workers the most. Families\nwere disrupted by unemployment, while traditional ideas of\nmasculinity and femininity could be challenged when the male\nbreadwinner was replaced by a spouse or daughter as the main\nsource of family income, leading to violence, alcoholism and\nabandonment of the family by men.\nCities were often unprepared to receive so many people so\nquickly. Inadequate housing, sanitation, and transportation\ncontributed to environment degradation and psychological\nstress. In the following illustration of London in the 1840s,\nconsider life for people who grew up on farms now living under\nthese conditions, with no sign of plant life to be seen: Modern World History 199\n\u201cOver London\u2013by Rail\u201d, from Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s 1872 book, London: A Pilgrimage.\nMany intellectuals took up the challenge of rethinking how to\nmake society more just for industrial workers. While the U.S.\nWar of Independence had inspired discussion of governments\nformed by \u201cwe, the people,\u201d and the French Revolution had\nspread the idea of legal equality of all citizens under law, a\nnew understanding of capital and labor seemed to be needed.\nWorkers in the new industries provided all of the labor at low\nwages and in dangerous conditions, while often absentee\nowners and investors reaped the profits. A number of\nindustrialists such as Robert Owen tried to make their factories\nmore humane, embracing the cooperative movement and even\nimproving workers\u2019 welfare with schools for their children and\nsocial gatherings. However, many business owners did not see\ntheir responsibility to workers extending beyond providing a\nwage for the work they performed.\nKarl Marx, a German philosopher, criticized the growth of\ncapitalism and industrialization, and brought a new analysis to\neconomic thinking. Marx saw industrialization as the last stage\nof human development, a final struggle between two opposites 200 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthat would create something new. According to Marx, this last\nbattle was between the more numerous workers, whom he\ncalled the proletariat and the industrial capitalists, the\nbourgeoisie. Marx believed the proletariat would inevitably\ndefeat the bourgeoisie, seize the factories, and create a socialist\nutopia.\nAfter the final battle, Marx predicted a world where the\nworkers or their government controlled the \u201cmeans of\nproduction\u201d, the factories and farms. Instead of religion, which\nMarx said was \u201cthe opiate of the people\u201d, workers would develop\na \u201cclass consciousness\u201d that would help extend the worldwide\nproletarian revolution. Marx imagined a global working class\nthat transcended nations, races, and ethnic groups\u2014his vision\nwas for an international dictatorship of the proletariat, where all\nworkers would unite regardless of ethnicity, language, religion,\nor any of the identities that had prevented European nations\nfrom forming a lasting empire. Modern World History 201\n\u201cPyramid of Capitalist System\u201d, published in 1911 by The International Publishing\nCompany, Cleveland OH.\nKarl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels, published their\nideas in the Communist Manifesto in February, 1848, just as\nEurope entered a year of attempted revolutions. Since these\nupheavals did not bring the promised dictatorship of the\nproletariat, Marx (who went into exile in London) continued\nto publish his theories and predictions, and organized the first\nMarxist socialist parties. He died in 1883, by which time various\nsocialist and social democratic parties had participated in 202 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nelections, but he did not live to see an actual \u201csocialist\u201d\nrevolution, which would finally occur in Russia in 1917.\nEven so, by the time of Marx\u2019s death, his ideas and other\nforms of socialism were motivating labor organizers to form\nunions in which workers could negotiate for better wages and\nworking conditions with owners, under threat of\nstriking\u2014stopping work at a factory and preventing others from\nreplacing them at the machines. Socialism and communism,\nand their influence in governments and labor relations, will be\nexamined more fully in later chapters.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did many workers find industrial cities challenging to live\nin?\n\u2022 Consider socialism\u2019s criticism of capitalism. Is it justified? Are\nMarx\u2019s expectations realistic?\nFertilizer\nAs mentioned previously, industrialization depends on a stable\nfoundation of agriculture to provide enough food for workers\nto increase the population and provide enough food for people\nto eat. As farming becomes more efficient, not everyone needs\nto focus on subsistence and workers are available to move to\ncities and take jobs in factories. The remaining farms become\nbigger and take on the responsibility of feeding the growing\nurban populations.\nEarlier agricultural societies in Europe had depended on crop\nrotation to rebuild soils after periods of intensive planting. But\nas farmers saw an opportunity to earn money in the market,\nfeeding urban industrial workers, some were unwilling to accept\nthe idea that a significant portion of their farms would be fallow\neach year. They preferred to amend their soils rather than\nwaiting for fertility to regenerate naturally. But few farmers had Modern World History 203\naccess to enough manure to supplement all their soil. Luckily,\nthere was an alternative.\nThe first commercial fertilizers were made from guano, the\ndroppings of seabirds living on islands off the western shores of\nSouth America. Guano comes from the Quechua Indian word\nWanu, which means any excrement used as a soil additive.\nGuano was dry, light, and highly concentrated. Natives of the\nAndes have mined guano on the coast and islands for at least\n1,500 years, and Spanish colonial records noted that Inca rulers\nhad considered protecting the cormorants that were the main\nsource of guano so important, that disturbing the birds\u2019 nesting\nareas a capital offense. Guano was carried from the coast up into\nthe Andes on the backs of llamas, for use on the terraced farms\nsurrounding highland cities like Machu Picchu.\nAlthough surrounded by\nocean, the islands off the\nwestern coast of South\nAmerica are arid. Like the\ndeserts they face on the\nmainland, some experience\nno annual rainfall at all.\nSeabirds such as cormorants\nand pelicans have lived on\nthese islands by the millions,\nfor thousands of years. Over\nthat time, they\u2019ve left literal\nmountains of droppings,\nwhich due to the lack of rain\nhave simply piled up. The\nWorkers mining guano on a Peruvian guano contains the ideal\nisland, 1860.\npercentages of nitrogen,\nphosphorus, and potassium\nto make it an excellent fertilizer without any mixing. It simply\nneeds to be chopped off the mountain, ground up, and spread\non fields.\nThe Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt visited the\nislands around 1802, and publicized guano\u2019s value as a fertilizer 204 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthroughout Europe. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity,\nEuropeans and Americans fell on the area in a guano rush,\nand by the middle of the century several nations had enlisted\nthe work of Chinese peasants in a Pacific labor system that has\nbeen compared with the slavery of the Atlantic world. Although\nthe Chinese workers were technically free, many were debtors\nwho had been tricked into labor contracts promising work in\nCalifornia. Once they reached the guano islands and realized\nthey had been duped, there was no way off. Over a hundred\nthousand Chinese workers were imported to the islands in the\nsecond half of the nineteenth century.\nGuano was so profitable that the U.S. Congress passed a Guano\nIslands Act in 1856. The law provided an incentive for American\nsailors to find and claim undefended islands for America by\ngiving the discoverer exclusive rights to the guano recovered.\nIslands claimed under the Guano Islands Act include parts of\nthe Hawaiian chain, Midway Atoll, part of American Samoa,\nand several islands still disputed with Colombia. The guano\nislands off the western coast of South America were so valuable\nthat two wars were fought over them. Chile and Peru fought\nSpain in the Chincha Islands War, 1864-66, and defeated the\nSpanish Empire. Then, once Spain\u2019s claim had been successfully\nset aside, Chile took many of the guano islands from Peru, along\nwith the nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert, in the War of the\nPacific, 1879-83. Modern World History 205\nThe Atacama Desert, now controlled by Chile, is the driest place on Earth.\nAfter about 1870, guano was overtaken\nas a source of nitrogen by nitrate-rich\ndesert soils called Caliche. These soils\nwere discovered in the Atacama desert,\na region regarded as the driest place\non earth that lay partly in Chile, partly\nin Peru, and partly in Bolivia. When\nall three nations rushed to extract and\nprocess the Caliche, Chile challenged\nits northern rivals for the nitrate fields.\nChile\u2019s victory in the War of the Pacific\nextended its border northwards to\nencompass the Atacama desert,\nincluding all the coastal territory that\nhad belonged to Bolivia. Many ethnic\nBolivians living around the port city of\nArica still dream of throwing off the\nChilean yoke and winning their\ncountry access to the Pacific again.\nDefeating its northern neighbors in the War of the Pacific made\nChile the undisputed power on the west coast of the Americas 206 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nand generated an economic boom. The nitrate Chile\nmonopolized was valuable both as a fertilizer and as a key\ningredient in explosives and munitions. But mining and\nprocessing nitrate from Chile\u2019s desert soil required much more\ncapital than digging guano. Chile attracted British investors, and\nsoon joint ventures began shipping a million tons of nitrate\nper year out of the South American desert. Production grew\nsteadily until 1914, when World War I created new incentives for\nBritain\u2019s enemies to find an alternative to Caliche nitrate. We\nwill discuss this shift to an economic form of imperialism, by\nEuropean nations, Britain, and even the United States, in the\nnext chapter.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did fertilizer become important enough to fight wars\nover?\n19th Century China and Japan\nAs described in Chapter Two, the origins of the modern world\nbegin in China and by 1500, under the Ming dynasty,\npopulation, culture and technology was flourishing, and\nConfucian-trained government officials administered the\nempire. However, after tremendous successes including the\nvoyages of Zheng He, a degree of corruption and misrule crept\ninto Ming imperial rule by the next century, allowing the armies\nof the Manchu, from north of the Great Wall, to instal a new\ndynasty, the Qing (\u201cPure\u201d).\nThe new Qing emperors reinvigorated the Confucian ruling\nclass, and China once again enjoyed a high degree of social\nstability, economic prosperity, and international trade.\nHowever, Qing society rested on the laurels of previous\naccomplishments, regarded foreigners as ignorant barbarians, Modern World History 207\nand was not receptive to expanding European influence in the\nregion, led by the British.\nBy the mid-1700s, the British East India Company dominated\ntrade and the administration of India. British ships carried\nIndian cloth and other products to the rest of the world; the\ntea dumped in Boston Harbor in 1773 came from India. The\nEast India Company was very interested in opening up Chinese\nmarkets to trade, but China was self-sufficient and uninterested\nin anything the British had to offer. Chinese teas, jade, silks\nand porcelain were in high demand in the West, but the only\npayment China would accept was silver. For centuries the silver\nof the New World had been making its way into the Chinese\neconomy, where it became the money supply of the world\u2019s\nlargest economy. The East India Company\u2019s supply of silver was\nlimited.\n19th-century western illustration of Chinese opium smokers.\nLuckily, India provided the Company with an alternative:\nopium from poppies, harvested in India and Burma. Although\nthe Qing had outlawed opium imports in 1729, the East India\nCompany controlled a virtually unlimited supply. At the\nbeginning of the 19th century an annual average of 4,500 trunks\nof opium were reaching smugglers on the South China coast.\nThe Company focused on importing opium into China, where 208 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\naddicts were willing to pay in silver. By 1839, over 40,000\n133-pound chests of opium were bought by Chinese drug\ndealers. More than 1% of China\u2019s 400 million people became\naddicted \u2013 many of them rich bureaucrats. China rapidly\nshifted from being a magnet for silver with a huge trade surplus\nto a net importer whose treasuries were rapidly dwindling.\nSome Chinese officials\nwanted to legalize opium so\nthe empire could tax it, but\nConfucian moralists won the\npolicy debate. In 1839, the\nemperor sent one of China\u2019s\nmost distinguished officials,\nLin Zexu, to the trading\nsettlement of Canton to\nstamp out the opium trade.\nLin blockaded the European\ntrading district, raided and\nsearched the foreigners\u2019\nwarehouses, confiscated\n20,000 chests containing\n1200 tons of opium, and\ndumped it all into the ocean.\nCommissioner Lin Zexu, dubbed \u201cLin of\nClear Skies\u201d for his moral integrity. The East India Company\ncomplained about its losses in\nLondon, and Queen Victoria sent a fleet including four steam-\npowered battleships. Lightly-armored Chinese war junks,\ndesigned to fight river pirates, were severely outgunned. The\nlimited range of Qing cannon compared to British artillery\nallowed the invaders to pummel Chinese defenses from a safe\ndistance.\nThe Treaty of Nanking (called the \u201cUnequal Treaty\u201d by the\nChinese) opened five Chinese ports to European traders, gave\nthe British the island of Hong Kong, and required China to\nestablish diplomatic relations with Great Britain as an equal\npower rather than continuing to treat all foreigners as\nbarbarians unworthy of official notice. The Chinese were also Modern World History 209\ncompelled to pay Britain for the opium Lin had destroyed.\nChina\u2019s embarrassing defeat by the British was followed by\nanother defeat in the Second Opium War (1856-60) that resulted\nin another unequal treaty giving access to French and Russian\nmerchants. By the 1890s, 90 ports of call were available to more\nthan 300,000 European and American traders, diplomats, and\nmissionaries.\nArmored, steam-powered British warships were able to easily destroy Chinese junks\nbuilt for coastal defense.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Were the British justified in their response to China\u2019s demand\nfor silver in payment of their manufactures?\n\u2022 What was the social impact of opium addiction on China?\nThe weakness of the Qing empire against foreign aggression\nwas exacerbated by the ongoing opium crisis and by crumbling\ninfrastructure and famine in the countryside. Magistrates and\nofficials addicted to opium were ineffective and often diverted 210 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmoney that should have been spent maintaining dams and\nirrigation canals to their own uses. A series of peasant revolts\nswept through south China in the 1850s and 1860s, most notably\nthe Taiping Rebellion which killed 30 million people over a\nfifteen-year period. The leader of the rebellion was Hong\nXiuquan, a young man who had become unhinged after failing\nthe grueling civil service exam four times. Hong had a vision\nand declared he was the little brother of Christ who had been\nsent to China to rid the land of the Manchu foreigners and their\nConfucianist culture. When Hong captured Nanjing and in 1853\nmade it the capital of the Taiping, he first killed all the Manchu\nmen and then marched the women outside the city and burned\nthem to death.\nHong\u2019s brutality and his strange interpretation of Christianity\nmay have alienated some Europeans, but his ban on opium\nuse antagonized more. Europe and Britain threw their support\nbehind the Qing dynasty they had just defeated in the Opium\nWars. Hong and his allies were unable to avoid the temptation\nto quarrel and plot against each other, which weakened their\nleadership. Two Taiping attempts to take Shanghai in 1860 and\n1862 were repelled with British and French assistance. In 1864,\nthe Qing and their European allies retook Nanjing and ended\nthe regime, but the resistance continued until 1871, when the last\nTaiping army was completely wiped out by government forces. Modern World History 211\nA scene of the Taiping Rebellion, 1850-1864\nElsewhere in Asia, Japan\u2019s insular self-confidence was also\nchallenged by forced contact with foreigners in the 19th\ncentury. The Japanese home islands have been united under\nthe same imperial dynasty since the 5th century CE; the current\nemperor comes from the longest line of any monarch in the\nworld. As an independent island nation, the Japanese were able\nto selectively accept or reject ideas and innovations from China,\nthe powerful empire to the west. Often they would modify\nand incorporate aspects of Chinese culture, like writing and\nBuddhism, to their own circumstances, Native Japanese Shinto\nreligion, for instance, embraces the teachings of Buddha.\nBeginning in the late 1100s, the emperor ruled indirectly,\nceding power to Shoguns, who commanded an army of lesser\nnobles known as samurai. The Shoguns held back invasions by\nMongol armies in the 1200s and maintained a large degree of\nseparation for the empire from outside religions and cultures.\nThis self-isolation ended in the mid-19th century, when the\nUnited States, which had been largely shut out of European-\ndominated China, decided to try and open trade with Japan. 212 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nCommodore Matthew C. Perry\u2019s visit of Kanagawa, near the site of present-day\nYokohama on March 8, 1854.\nAmerican Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay\nin July 1853 with a squadron of four warships and threatened\nto open fire on the capital if the Japanese refused to negotiate.\nTo demonstrate, Perry destroyed several buildings around the\nharbor. The American fleet withdrew to allow the Japanese to\nconsider their options and when they returned a year later, the\nJapanese agreed to a \u201cTreaty of Peace and Amity.\u201d Three years\nlater a \u201cTreaty of Amity and Commerce\u201d was signed, offered\nto the Japanese by American diplomats as a less-invasive\nalternative to the aggressive colonialism of Britain and France\nin China following the Opium War.\nThe Japanese decided, \u201cif we take the initiative, we can\ndominate; if we do not, we will be dominated.\u201d Modernization\nand the embrace of new technology went hand in hand with\nreorganization of the national government in what became\nknown as the Meiji Restoration. The 15th Tokugawa shogun\nresigned in November 1867 and direct control of government\nwas restored to the Emperor Meiji. The samurai class (which\nnumbered nearly 2 million) was slowly disbanded and a\nnationwide universal military draft was instituted in 1873.\nDisgruntled samurai rebelled in 1876, the Satsuma Rebellion Modern World History 213\ngrew into a short civil war in which the newly-formed Imperial\nJapanese Army won a decisive victory. The industrialization of\nJapan accelerated, building the strong nation we will see taking\nits place on the world stage in the next chapter.\nSatirical drawing in the magazine Punch ( September 1894), showing the victory of\n\u201csmall\u201d Japan over \u201clarge\u201d China.\nMeanwhile, in China, other rebellions such as the Nian\nRebellion (1853-68), the Panthay Rebellion (1855-73), and the\nDungan revolt (1862-77) continued to challenge the Qing\nregime. In 1895, China lost its control of its tribute state Korea\nto Japan in the first Sino-Japanese War. The humiliating defeat\nfor the Qing empire showed their efforts to modernize China\u2019s\nmilitary had failed and was a catalyst for a series of political\nactions led by revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen. China ended the\nnineteenth century under the control of European powers and\ngenerally considered to be \u201cthe weak man of Asia.\u201d\nQuestions for Discussion 214 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Compare the Taiping Rebellion to the US Civil War, which\nhappened about the same time. How were the two conflicts\nsimilar and different?\n\u2022 Why do you think Japan was more able to rapidly respond to\nthe challenge of western culture?\nPrimary Sources\nLIN ZEXU, LETTER TO QUEEN VICTORIA (1839)\nLooking over the public documents accompanying the\ntribute sent (by your predecessors) on various occasions, we\nfind the following: \u201cAll the people of my country, arriving at\nthe Central Land for purposes of trade, have to feel grateful\nto the great emperor for the most perfect justice, for the\nkindest treatment,\u201d and other words to that effect. Delighted\ndid we feel that the kings of your honorable nation so clearly\nunderstood the great principles of propriety, and were so\ndeeply grateful for the heavenly goodness (of our\nemperor):\u2014therefore, it was that we of the heavenly dynasty\nnourished and cherished your people from afar, and\nbestowed upon them redoubled proofs of our urbanity and\nkindness. It is merely from these circumstances, that your\ncountry\u2014 deriving immense advantage from its commercial\nintercourse with us, which has endured now two hundred\nyears\u2014has become the rich and flourishing kingdom that it is\nsaid to be!\nBut, during the commercial intercourse which has existed\nso long, among the numerous foreign merchants resorting\nhither, are wheat and tares, good and bad; and of these latter\nare some, who, by means of introducing opium by stealth,\nhave seduced our Chinese people, and caused every province\nof the land to overflow with that poison. These then know\nmerely to advantage themselves, they care not about injuring\nothers! This is a principle which heaven\u2019s Providence\nrepugnates; and which mankind conjointly look upon with\nabhorrence! Moreover, the great emperor hearing of it,\nactually quivered with indignation, and especially dispatched Modern World History 215\nme, the commissioner, to Canton, that in conjunction with the\nviceroy and lieut.-governor of the province, means might be\ntaken for its suppression!\nEvery native of the Inner Land who sells opium, as also all\nwho smoke it, are alike adjudged to death. Were we then\nto go back and take up the crimes of the foreigners, who,\nby selling it for many years have induced dreadful calamity\nand robbed us of enormous wealth, and punish them with\nequal severity, our laws could not but award to them absolute\nannihilation! But, considering that these said foreigners did\nyet repent of their crime, and with a sincere heart beg for\nmercy; that they took 20,283 chests of opium piled up in\ntheir store-ships, and through Elliot, the superintendent of\nthe trade of your said country, petitioned that they might be\ndelivered up to us, when the same were all utterly destroyed,\nof which we, the imperial commissioner and colleagues, made\na duly prepared memorial to his majesty;\u2014considering these\ncircumstances, we have happily received a fresh proof of the\nextraordinary goodness of the great emperor, inasmuch as\nhe who voluntarily comes forward, may yet be deemed a\nfit subject for mercy, and his crimes be graciously remitted\nhim. But as for him who again knowingly violates the laws,\ndifficult indeed will it be thus to go on repeatedly pardoning!\nHe or they shall alike be doomed to the penalties of the\nnew statute. We presume that you, the sovereign of your\nhonorable nation, on pouring out your heart before the altar\nof eternal justice, cannot but command all foreigners with the\ndeepest respect to reverence our laws! If we only lay clearly\nbefore your eyes, what is profitable and what is destructive,\nyou will then know that the statutes of the heavenly dynasty\ncannot but be obeyed with fear and trembling!\n\u2026\nYour honorable nation takes away the products of our\ncentral land, and not only do you thereby obtain food and\nsupport for yourselves, but moreover, by re-selling these\nproducts to other countries you reap a threefold profit. Now\nif you would only not sell opium, this threefold profit would\nbe secured to you: how can you possibly consent to forgo it\nfor a drug that is hurtful to men, and an unbridled craving\nafter gain that seems to know no bounds! Let us suppose that 216 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nforeigners came from another country, and brought opium\ninto England, and seduced the people of your country to\nsmoke it, would not you, the sovereign of the said country,\nlook upon such a procedure with anger, and in your just\nindignation endeavor to get rid of it? Now we have always\nheard that your highness possesses a most kind and\nbenevolent heart, surely then you are incapable of doing or\ncausing to be done unto another, that which you should not\nwish another to do unto you!\n\u2026\nOur celestial empire rules over ten thousand kingdoms!\nMost surely do we possess a measure of godlike majesty\nwhich ye cannot fathom! Still we cannot bear to slay or\nexterminate without previous warning, and it is for this\nreason that we now clearly make known to you the fixed laws\nof our land. If the foreign merchants of your said honorable\nnation desire to continue their commercial intercourse, they\nthen must tremblingly obey our recorded statutes, they must\ncut off for ever the source from which the opium flows, and\non no account make an experiment of our laws in their own\npersons! Let then your highness punish those of your subjects\nwho may be criminal, do not endeavor to screen or conceal\nthem, and thus you will secure peace and quietness to your\npossessions, thus will you more than ever display a proper\nsense of respect and obedience, and thus may we unitedly\nenjoy the common blessings of peace and happiness. What\ngreater joy! What more complete felicity than this!\nLet your highness immediately, upon the receipt of this\ncommunication, inform us promptly of the state of matters,\nand of the measure you are pursuing utterly to put a stop to\nthe opium evil. Please let your reply be speedy. Do Do not on\nany account make excuses or procrastinate. A most important\ncommunication.

These laborers, who must sell themselves\npiecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of\ncommerce, and are consequently exposed to all the\nvicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the\nmarket.\nOwing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the\ndivision of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all\nindividual character, and, consequently, all charm for the\nworkman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it\nis only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily\nacquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of\nproduction of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the\nmeans of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and\nfor the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity,\nand therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production.\nIn proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work\nincreases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as\nthe use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the Modern World History 219\nsame proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether\nby prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the\nwork exacted in a given time or by increased speed of\nmachinery, etc.\nModern Industry has converted the little workshop of the\npatriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial\ncapitalist. Masses of laborers, crowded into the factory, are\norganized like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they\nare placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of\nofficers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the\nbourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily\nand hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and,\nabove all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.\nThe more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end\nand aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more\nembittering it is.\nThe less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual\nlabour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes\ndeveloped, the more is the labour of men superseded by\nthat of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer\nany distinctive social validity for the working class. All are\ninstruments of labour, more or less expensive to use,\naccording to their age and sex.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Europe_1815_map_en \u00a9 Alexander Altenhof is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 Napoleon_sainthelene \u00a9 Franti\u0161ek Xaver Sandmann is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 ChartistRiot \u00a9 Alfred Pearse is licensed under a Public 220 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nDomain license\n\u2022 Irish_potato_famine_Bridget_O\u2019Donnel \u00a9 Illustrated\nLondon News is licensed under a Public Domain\nlicense\n\u2022 2880px-Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-\nCounty.svg \u00a9 US Census is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 Powerloom_weaving_in_1835 \u00a9 T.

And even then,\n222 Modern World History 223\n\u201cempires\u201d have remained as important as ever in the late 20th\nand the 21st century, although the power of the new empires\nthat have been successful has been largely economic rather than\npolitical.\nConsider the decline of the empires we\u2019ve already become\nfamiliar with in earlier chapters, in Asia, Europe, and the\nMuslim world. They were territorial empires that had used\nmilitary conquest to impose political control over wide\nexpanses of land adjacent to their ancestral homelands. They\nexisted by providing a degree of civil and economic order, in\nexchange for taxes on the agricultural produce of the agrarian\npopulations they conquered. These empires usually left their\ncitizens more or less alone to speak their own languages,\npractice their own religions, and observe their own cultural\ntraditions. Occasionally they took captives from conquered\nlands, like the janissaries of the Ottoman Empire. 224 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Portuguese and Spanish began establishing the first\nEuropean overseas empires in Azores and Canary Islands in\nthe late 1400s, extending their overseas imperial project into\nthe Americas after 1492. In the process, the Spanish defeated\nseveral land-based indigenous empires such as the Aztecs, Inca,\nand Maya, and replaced the native rulers with Spanish Viceroys.\nThe British, French, Dutch, and others soon followed the\nIberians into the Caribbean and North America. All the\nEuropean colonies in the Americas were controlled by their\nrespective \u201cmother\u201d countries, sending resources like silver and\ngold and agricultural products (especially sugar) to Europe, and\noften required to trade only with the \u201cmother\u201d economy. As we\nwill see, Europeans continued this model of overseas empires in Modern World History 225\nthe 1800s as Africa and parts of Asia came to be dominated by\noutside imperial powers.\nHowever, the new project of economic \u201cneo-imperialism\u201d also\nappeared in the 19th century, especially in the new republics of\nLatin America. In this case, supposedly independent countries\nthat had recently won their independence from the Spanish\nand Portuguese empires, were economically dominated by\nEuropean and U.S. investors, still providing raw materials for\nthe \u201cGreat Powers\u201d in exchange for finished industrial goods. As\npresented later, nearly all of these new nations became indebted\nto European banks and faced the humiliation of \u201cgunboat\ndiplomacy\u201d in which U.S. and European powers took over\ncustom houses to force payment of loans.\nBefore World War One, the decline of land-based empires was\nnearly complete, while overseas empires flourished.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why would a shift from land-based to overseas empires be a\nsignificant change? How would such a change affect history?\nDeclining Land-Based Empires\nThe land-based empires began a precipitous decline after the\nNapoleonic wars, some sooner than others. The challenge of\nnationalism some of these multi-ethnic empires. Members of\ndistinct cultural, religious, and linguistic groups began to\ndemand more autonomy within these empires, which\nfrequently led to the establishment of independent nation-\nstates. In other cases, empires that resisted change were\nconquered by powerful nations expanding their overseas\nempires. Often these factors combined to challenge land-based\nempires. 226 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Ottoman Empire declined very slowly during the 19th\ncentury\u2014when it was called \u201cthe Sick Man of Europe\u201d\u2014but\nit was able to persist until World War I. The Sunni Muslim\nOttoman homeland was present-day Turkey, which bordered\non Orthodox Christian Russia to the north, the Catholic\nHabsburg (Austro-Hungarian) Empire to the west, and the\nShiite Iranians who succeeded the Safavid Empire in Persia\nto the east. The Russians aided the Orthodox Greeks, Serbs,\nand Bulgarians in their successful struggles for independence.\nThe Ottoman capital, Istanbul, had been Constantinople, home\nof the Byzantine Empire and of Greek Orthodox Christianity\nbefore the Ottoman conquest of 1453; and the leaders of Russia\nwanted to reestablish Christian rule there.\nThe Greeks were the first to successfully free themselves from\nOttoman rule in the 1820s. They found support not only from\nImperial Russia, but also from the British and French, who\nsought more economic and political influence in the Eastern\nMediterranean. The struggle for Greek freedom, in the\nbirthplace of democracy and and home of classical literature\nand art, fired the imagination of the artists and writers of the\n\u201cRomantic\u201d movement then flourishing in Europe. English poet\nLord Byron lost his life in service to the Greek cause. Modern World History 227\n\u201cCharge of the Light Brigade\u201d, October 5, 1854, from the Russian perspective on the\nhigh ground.\nBy the mid-19th century, disputes between European powers\nover what would happen to Ottoman territory caused the\nCrimean War (1853-1856), in which France, Great Britain, the\nItalian Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Ottomans opposed an\nexpanding Russian Empire. The Crimean War was the first\nmajor war of the Industrial Age, featuring the use of railways,\ntelegraphs, and modern ordnance like rifles and exploding\nnaval artillery. Disastrous mismatches between traditional\nmilitary tactics and the realities of modern war occurred, such\nas the incident immortalized in Alfred Tennyson\u2019s poem \u201cThe\nCharge of the Light Brigade.\u201d The poem describes a frontal\nassault by a British light cavalry unit armed only with lances\nand sabers against an artillery battery dug in on high ground\nat the battle of Balaclava in 1855. Although Tennyson\u2019s poem\npraises the bravery of the cavalrymen who charged through\nthe so-called Valley of Death, events like these became symbols\nof the logistical and tactical mismanagement of the war effort.\nThe conflict also revealed the weakness of the Russian Empire,\nwhich fielded large armies but lagged in both tactics and\ntechnology. In the treaty following the war, Russia was forced to\nremove its naval fleet from the Black Sea. 228 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Ottomans also faced an\nongoing dispute with the\nEgyptians, who gained\npractical independence under\nthe Ottoman-appointed\ngovernor Muhammad Ali\nfrom 1805-1848. Ali\nmodernized Egypt in many\nways, while his son,\nMuhammad Sa\u2019id, granted a\nland concession in 1854 to\nFrench businessman\nFerdinand de Lesseps to dig a\ncanal from the\nMediterranean to the Red\nSea. The building of the Suez\nCanal, completed in 1869, was\ninitially opposed by Great\nBritain because they feared its\ncontrol by the French would\nshift the balance of power in\nEurope. The canal took\nNASA image of the Suez Canal from space,\neleven years to build, using\nconnecting the Mediterranean Sea with the\nRed Sea. forced Egyptian labor.\nAlthough the Suez Canal\nCompany was an international corporation, its shares did not\nsell well outside France and Egypt. But in 1875, Sa\u2019id\u2019s son Ismail\nput Egypt\u2019s shares up for sale and British Prime Minister\nBenjamin Disraeli bought the shares with an unsecured\n\u00a34,000,000 loan from his close personal friend Baron Lionel de\nRothschild, head of the famous international bank. Although\nFrance still owned more shares, Britain sent troops to protect\nthe canal during an Egyptian civil war in 1882 and in 1888 the\ncanal was declared a neutral zone under British protection.\nUsing the canal, British steamships were able to avoid sailing\naround Africa and reach India in two weeks instead of two\nmonths.\nInspired the example of the Greeks, and encouraged by the\nRussians and others, Montenegro, Serbia, and Bulgaria achieved Modern World History 229\nnearly-complete independence from the Sultan in Istanbul by\n1878. Although they belonged to distinct ethnic and linguistic\ngroups, the majority of people in these territories were\nOrthodox Christians. However, as we will see in the next\nchapter, these new countries had trouble resolving disputes over\nborders and political control, since the different peoples lived\nall over the region in villages and towns that were frequently\n\u201cmajority-minority.\u201d Nationalism was the motivation for\nindependence, but the national community existed across many\nfrontiers\u2014how should they be united? And what should be\ndone about the \u201cother\u201d living within one\u2019s own country?\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were Englishmen like Lord Byron so supportive of Greek\nindependence?\n\u2022 What does the Charge of the Light Brigade tell us about the\nchanging nature of warfare?\n\u2022 Why is the Suez Canal so significant? 230 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n1873 painting depicting Russian serfs hearing of their emancipation in 1861.\nWhen the Russian Empire\u2019s ambitions were thwarted in the\nCrimean War, Russians were forced to confront their military\nincompetence and social backwardness. Serfdom tied peasants\nand their families to the land, and although they were not\nslaves, serfs were included in any property transaction among\nthe landed gentry. Tsar Alexander II declared an end to\nserfdom in 1861, shortly before President Lincoln\u2019s 1863\nEmancipation Proclamation, during the United States Civil War.\nBoth countries were among the last in their respective regions to\nformally end forced labor obligations and like the newly-\u201cfreed\u201d\nin the U.S., the liberty of many former Russian serfs existed\nonly on paper.\nRussian industries expanded with investment from western\nEurope: factories and rail networks soon appeared, especially in\nthe European part of Russia. However, the slowness of political\nand social change led to frustration among potential reformers,\nwho instead turned to revolutionary action, often led by\nanarchists. Anarchism is similar to socialism in its concept of\nclass struggle, but anarchists believe that all forms of top-down\ncontrol\u2014governments, police, organized religion\u2014should be\nimmediately eliminated, allowing the natural cooperativeness\nof humanity to thrive in smaller consensus-based entities.\nRussian anarchists succeeded in assassinating the reformist Tsar Modern World History 231\nAlexander II in 1881, on the day he had given approval for a\nlimited form of parliamentary government. His son, Alexander\nIII, rejected this political reform; he, in turn, was also murdered\nby anarchists, in 1894. His son, Nicholas II, was not open to any\nchecks on his absolute power.\nDozens of ethnic and\nreligious groups lived in the\nterritories of the Russian\nEmpire; attempts at\n\u201crussification\u201d were\ninconclusive.

The Spanish line\ndied out in 1700, but the Austrian House of Habsburg would\nreign until 1918.\nAt the end of the Napoleonic period, the Habsburg Empire\ndominated southeastern Europe, up to the frontiers of the\nOttoman and Russians. While the Tsars felt a special kinship\nwith Orthodox Christians under Turkish rule\u2014Greeks, Serbs,\nand Bulgarians\u2014the Habsburg monarchs supported Catholics\nof the Ottoman region, like the Croats. Until 1815, the Habsburgs\nhad been the Holy Roman Emperors; during the Protestant\nReformation, they fought to maintain Catholicism as the official\nreligion of their realm.\nAlthough united by religion, the Habsburg empire was\ndivided by a growing sense of nationality. German-speaking\nAustrian Habsburg emperors ruled Hungarians, Czechs,\nUkrainians, Poles, Slovaks, Romanians, Jews, Slovenes, Croats,\nSerbs, and Albanians. By the middle of the nineteenth century,\nmany of these peoples wanted their own nations. The rebellions\nand revolutions of 1848 came close to breaking up the Habsburg\nterritories in a wave of nationalist and socialist fervor. The\nrevolutionaries did not achieve all of their goals, but serfdom\nwas abolished, several regions gained a greater degree of\nautonomy, and Emperor Ferdinand I abdicated in favor of his\nnephew Franz Josef.\nUnification of Italy in the\n1860s and and Germany in\n1870 allowed the Hungarians,\nwho became the most\nnumerous minority within\nthe realm, to achieve near-\ncomplete independence. In\n1867, the emperor agreed to\nestablish a \u201cdual monarchy\u201d,\nthe Austro-Hungarian Ethnicities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire\nEmpire. Administration was in 1911.\ndivided between Austrian and 234 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nHungarian parliaments, while the Austrian emperor managed\nforeign policy. This compromise merely spread out the\nnationalist problem for two kings instead of one: Romanians\ndemanded more autonomy from the Hungarian administration\nin Budapest, while the Czechs asked for the same from the\nAustrian government in Vienna.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What was the main factor uniting the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire?\n\u2022 What were the factors fracturing the unity?\nA united Germany, achieved in 1870, brought together an\nagricultural east with an industrialized west, creating an entirely\nnew \u201cGreat Power\u201d in Europe to rival Great Britain and France.\nThe new nation called itself the German Empire (Deutsches\nReich); its ambition to take a place at the table of imperial powers\nupset the post-Napoleonic European balance of power and,\neventually, became a cause of the two twentieth-century world\nwars.

Bismarck used war as a way to unite the German\nprincipalities. First, in 1864, he started a brief war with Denmark\nthat brought together most of the northern German states as\nallies of Prussia. A war with Austria in 1866 solidified these states\nin a confederation with Prussian King Wilhelm I, while at the\nsame time, the newly unified Italy took advantage of a weakened\nAustria to claim Italian-speaking Hapsburg territories.\nTo bring in the mostly Catholic southern German states (led\nby Bavaria), Bismarck offended Napoleon III of France, making\nterritorial promises in the Austrian war that he did not keep\nwith the French emperor (among other transgressions). When\nthe nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been president\nof France before declaring himself emperor, went to war with\nPrussia in 1870, he counted on the neutrality of the other\nGerman states and on Austrian help, neither of which\nhappened.\nPrussia had one of the best-trained armies in Europe and\nsurprised the French with their rapid advance.

The French\nagreed to territorial losses as they formed a Third Republic 236 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nto replace Napoleon III. In early 1871, Bismarck initiated a\ngathering of the German princes at the French royal palace\nin Versailles, outside Paris, to join together as a new unified\nnational state, with the Prussian King Wilhelm I as emperor.\nWilhelm I proclaimed Emperor. The man in white is the Prussian chancellor Otto von\nBismarck, responsible for organizing the Empire.

The Franco-\nPrussian War was the first of three major conflicts between the\nFrench and the Germans over the next 75 years in which\nmillions would die\u2014but one can take heart in the idea that in\nmore recent decades, the two countries have become strong\nallies, forming the primary economic and political relationship\nof the current European Union. If the French and Germans\ncan set aside old conflicts and work together, perhaps Indians\nand Pakistanis, Sunnis and Shi\u2019ites, Israelis and Palestinians, and\nother \u201cenemies\u201d can eventually do the same. Modern World History 237\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Was Germany justified in its desire to become a \u201cGreat\nPower\u201d like Britain and France?\nRising Overseas Empires\nEven though the British North American colonies achieved\nindependence and became the United States, Britain held on to\nCanada and retained control of islands in the Caribbean, while\n(as described below) London\u2019s bankers and British industry\nwould dominate the finance and trade in the new Latin\nAmerican republics.\nUnlike the Thirteen\nColonies, Canada achieved its\nindependence from Britain\nmuch more slowly, without a\nrevolution. Although the\nFrench-speaking Quebecois\nand the British in Ontario\ncould easily have been at each\nother\u2019s throats, anxiety over\nan invasion from the United\nStates (which was tried\nunsuccessfully in 1775 and\n1812) held a fragile alliance\ntogether. After two more\nincursions by American\nforces in the 1830s, the British\nSir John A. Macdonald, first Prime Minister North America Act of 1867\nof Canada (1878-1891). created the Dominion of\nCanada by combining\nQuebec, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and New Brunswick. John A.\nMacDonald became the nation\u2019s first Prime Minister in 1867, 238 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nnegotiated the purchase of the Northwest Territories from the\nHudson\u2019s Bay company in 1869, and convinced Manitoba,\nPrince Edward Island, and British Columbia to join the\nDominion. MacDonald knew that like the U.S., Canada\u2019s eastern\nand western coastal regions needed a transcontinental railroad\nto bind them together. The Canadian Pacific Railroad was\ncompleted in 1885. The C.P. Railroad operates mostly just north\nof the border, although several lines connected to U.S. cities\nsuch as Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Chicago. Even\ntoday, 90% of Canada\u2019s 36 million population live within 100\nmiles of the U.S. border.\nCanadian-Pacific Rail Map\nThe British had also claimed Australia, which they settled in\nthe late 18th century with convicts. Most of the crimes were\npetty or related to debt, while some were political, such as the\nIrish condemned for protesting English rule. New Zealand was\nsettled in the early 19th century through a private company,\nfollowing the model established in the colonization of some\nof the Thirteen Colonies. In both cases, the native peoples lost\nland in much the same manner as in British North America.\nIn Australia, the vast continent allowed for the aborigines to\nretreat, until environmental and other factors brought them\ninto increasing contact with the settlers and their descendants.\nIn New Zealand, relations between the native Maori and the\nsettlers followed a pattern similar to those of the western United\nStates: treaties made, treaties broken, wars fought and won by\nthe settlers, who took more land. However, respect and Modern World History 239\ncelebration of Maori rights and culture have become integral to\nNew Zealand identity in recent decades.\nIndia was the most important colony for the British,\ndetermining much of its international diplomacy until after\nWorld War Two. When the British East India Company began\nits conquest of India in the 1700s, the Mughal Empire was\nentering a long period of decline after its peak in the 16th and\n17th centuries. The Company took advantage of the empire\u2019s\nweakness to expand its trading activities, and slowly took over\nthe regional principalities that split off from Mughal control.\nBy the 1700s, Indian tea had become an important part of the\nBritish diet\u2014even for their colonists in North America, who\ndumped Indian tea into the Boston Harbor in protest against\ntaxes on the product in 1773. By the middle of the 19th century,\nthe Company controlled most of mainland India, Pakistan,\nBurma, and Bangladesh, as well as Sri Lanka. The Company\nshifted its policy away from simply trading, and began\nreorganizing the Indian economy, clearing forests and\nestablishing widespread cultivation of tea, coffee, cotton, and\nopium for use in China. By the time the Crown took over direct\ncontrol of the colony in 1858 after an uprising called the Sepoy\nMutiny, India was a producer of agricultural products and raw\nmaterials for Britain\u2019s growing industrial economy. 240 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n1909 Map of the British India, showing British India in two shades of pink and the\nprincely states in yellow.\nBy the mid-19th century, the British in India had established\nan imperial model that had proved lucrative for investors: the\ncolony provided raw material and resources for the consumers\nand industries of the \u201chome country,\u201d while Indians purchased\nmass-produced textiles and other goods from British factories\nas a \u201ccaptive market.\u201d This closed economic system was\nattractive to both older and newer European empires\u2014setting\noff, as we shall see, a scramble for colonies in Africa in the\nlate-19th century.\nThe British administration of India, however, also provided a\nmodel for other European imperialists. Clearly, the tiny island\nkingdom could not direct all of the affairs of their Indian\npossession\u2014trained locals needed to aid in governance. This\nprocess began under the East India Company with the\nformation of native army and police forces, commanded by\nBritish officers, but soon included educated local administrators\nwho spoke English and understood and applied imperial laws\nand edicts. By the 1850s, the British had founded their first\nschools to instruct the local elite in English, engineering, Modern World History 241\nscience, and British imperial law. This model proved so effective\nin India that Indian immigrants often followed the British to\ntheir new colonies in Africa, where Indians operated the\nrailways and postal service, and Indian carpenters and\nbricklayers constructed government offices and private homes\nfor the new colonial political and commercial elites. Indian\nshopkeepers played an enormous role in the local economies\nof these new colonies well into the 20th century. Indians even\nmigrated to Great Britain\u2019s territories in the Caribbean as\nindentured servants\u2014in Guyana, in northern South America,\nover 40% of the population is of \u201cIndia-Indian\u201d descent.\nThe story of Mahatma\nGandhi, who later helped lead\nIndia to independence, is an\nexample of a native trained to\nmanage the Empire. After an\neducation in a British school\nin India, Gandhi went to\nLondon and studied law. On\ngraduating he went to South\nAfrica to serve the British\nEmpire as a lawyer for\ntwenty-five years before\nbeginning a new career\nadvocating for Indian\nindependence. This, too, was\nPhotograph of Mahatma Gandhi in 1909,\na pattern duplicated in other\nwhen he was a lawyer in South Africa.\nEuropean empires:\neventually, educated local elites and professionals would begin\nto demand greater autonomy, if not outright independence,\nsince they were already administering the colonies for the\n\u201cmother country.\u201d Ho Chi Minh, who would fight with and then\nagainst U.S. forces for the independence of Vietnam, applied for\nadmission to the French academy in Marseilles that trained\nimperial administrators.

At the constitutional convention in 1787,\nthey agreed to abolish the slave trade in the U.S. starting in\n1808. Many seem to have expected that slavery would gradually\ndisappear. Even the slaveowner Thomas Jefferson idealized the\nindependent, self-sufficient yeoman farmer rather than the\nSouthern planter as the hope of American democracy.\nHowever, Eli Whitney\u2019s\ninvention of the cotton gin\ngave new life to the institution\nof slavery.

They established\ntheir own farms and even plantations, published a bilingual\nnewspaper, governed themselves in a bicameral legislature, and\neven owned black slaves. Nevertheless, they were cast out of the\nsouthern states by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, forced to\nleave ancestral lands and relocate in Oklahoma, west of the\nMississippi River. The \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d for these displaced people\nwas well-named: thousands died in the forced march across the\nSouth and during their settlement in a completely different 244 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nenvironment. Despite treaties, similar processes also occurred\nin the Louisiana Territory and beyond.\nThe territories of\nindependent Mexico north of\nthe Rio Grande River had\nbeen only lightly settled by\nthe Spanish.

The new\nsettlers rebelled, and achieved independence after a brief war in\n1836, and immediately brought enslaved people to work on\ncotton plantations.\nAlthough Mexico\u2019s treaty with independent Texas included\na pledge that the new republic would not become a state of\nthe United States, Texas did join the union in 1845 and a war\nensued. Not only did the U.S. government send troops south\nto defend Texas, they sent enough to defeat Mexico decisively.\nMany Americans argued that the United States had a \u201cManifest\nDestiny\u201d that required it to become a continental nation. The\nU.S. Army eventually occupied Mexico City in 1848 and\nconquered all of the territory to the Pacific Ocean. In defeat, the\nMexicans signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and ceded\nall of their territory north of the Rio Grande River. Mexico lost Modern World History 245\nover half its land area, and the United States acquired California,\nArizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, and part of\nWyoming. At the same time, the U.S. government negotiated a\ntreaty with Great Britain to establish a border in the disputed\nOregon territory. By 1849, the United States had completed its\nadvance across the continent.\nMap of Mexico and the United States in 1824, before the Texas Secession and the\nMexican-American War.\nAlmost immediately after the Mexicans were defeated, gold was\ndiscovered by a U.S. settler in northern California. \u201cForty-\nniners\u201d joined the Gold Rush from the eastern states and from\nas far away as Chile and China. California became a U.S. state\nthe next year. Again, rapid settlement came at the expense of\nNative Americans. Chinese laborers were soon restricted in\ntheir movements. The United States was a \u201cwhite man\u2019s\ncountry\u201d, and they became the first ethnic group explicitly\nbarred from immigrating to the U.S. in the Chinese Exclusion\nAct of 1882. And finally, the rapid expansion of territory and\nestablishment of new states upended the careful balance\nbetween slave and free states that had prevented armed conflict.\nAn escalation of violence in Kansas and increasing political 246 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\npolarization led to the formation of a new political party (the\nRepublicans), election of a president from this party (former\nIllinois Congressman Abraham Lincoln), and the secession of\nmost of the Southern slave states.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did technological progress impact the politics of slavery?\n\u2022 How do you think the idea of Manifest Destiny held by people\nin the United States affected our history?\nThe Civil War, like the Crimean a few\nyears earlier, was one of the first\nmodern wars that brought new\ntechnology to the battlefield. Railroads\nand steamboats made troop\ntransportation quicker and more\nefficient, while the electric telegraph\nnot only improved military\ncommunication, but also made war\nnews more immediately available to\nthe newspaper-reading public in the\nU.S. and abroad. The industrialized\nnorthern states benefitted the most\nfrom the new technologies, since they\ncould produce more war materiel and\nget troops to the front more quickly\nthan the South, which lagged in both\nindustry and railroads.\nSouthern hopes of maintaining an independent Confederacy\ndepended on support from Europe. Southern cotton supplied\nthe textile mills of Great Britain and France, enriching those\ncountries, and Confederate planters expected these business ties Modern World History 247\nto influence government decisions. Great Britain hesitated to\nrecognize the independence of the Confederacy, but in the end\ndeclined when the Union began racking up victories in 1863. At\nthe same time, Emperor Napoleon III\u2014nephew of the man who\nhad sold Louisiana to Jefferson\u2014pursued an imperial scheme to\ncreate a pro-French monarchy in Mexico which would support\nthe Confederates. Napoleon\u2019s plan failed when Mexican troops\nunexpectedly defeated the French army at the Battle of Puebla\non May 5, 1862. Although Maximilian, brother of the Emperor,\nwould briefly rule Mexico, the project was a disaster for\nNapoleon. After the Union victory in the U.S., French troops\nleft Mexico and Maximilian was executed by firing squad in\n1867 as Mexican liberals, led by Benito Ju\u00e1rez, reestablished\nMexican independence. The date of the Battle of Puebla is still\ncelebrated as Cinco de Mayo by Mexican-Americans throughout\nthe United States.\nBecause some U.S. publishers are interested in selling their\ntextbooks to school boards in the former Confederate States,\nthey often soft-pedal the Civil War in a way that creates\nconfusion. So, let\u2019s be very clear: it is absurd to claim that\nsupporting slavery was legitimately based on the \u201csanctity of\nprivate property rights\u201d espoused by the U.S. Founding Fathers\nas part of their Enlightenment values. It is not reasonable to\nargue that property is a human right, but only for some\nhumans, and that other humans can be property, rather than\nhaving property rights. Furthermore, the U.S. Civil War was\nabout slavery, NOT about \u201cstates\u2019 rights.\u201d Although the\nConfederacy made this claim after they lost, when they seceded\nand while they thought they were winning, the South very\nclearly stated it was leaving the Union to preserve the institution\nof slavery.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 What motivates people to argue that the Civil War was fought\nover something other than slavery? 248 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nNeo-Imperialism in Latin America\nAs described in Chapter 4, Latin America achieved\nindependence from Spain and Portugal in the first decades of\nthe 1800s. Great Britain was particularly interested in an\nindependent Latin America as a source of markets for its\nindustrial products, while English and Irish mercenaries,\navailable after the Napoleonic Wars, joined the fight for\nfreedom alongside Bolivar and others in Latin America. The\nSpanish and Portuguese became the first Europeans to begin\nlosing their overseas empires, nearly 150 years before the\nBritish, French, and others would go through the same process.\nThe new countries of Latin America suffered through a long\nperiod of struggle to establish stable governments and thriving\neconomies\u2014which, depending on the country, included civil\nwars, dictatorships, social and political reforms, and economic\ndependence on a handful of exports and their international\nprice.\nThe new countries also\nwere the first to experience\nneo-imperialism\u2014a \u201cnew\u201d\nimperialism that technically\nrespected national\nsovereignty, but in reality\nforced governments to bend\nto foreign influence. In the\n1820s and 1830s, the new\nGauchos relaxing in the Argentine Pampas,\ngovernments of Latin\nas a side of beef cooks over the fire.\nAmerica quickly became\nindebted to British banks, which had arranged large loans in\nanticipation that independence would bring rapid economic\ndevelopment as it had in the United States. Meanwhile, local\nartisans could not compete with British textiles and other\nmanufactured goods that flooded the markets of the new\nrepublics. Many countries became dependent on the\ninternational price of a handful\u2014or even a single\u2014export such\nas copper and nitrates in Chile, coffee in Brazil, beef and grain\nin Argentina, sugar in Cuba, and bananas in Central America. Modern World History 249\nBritish investors in Latin America were followed by French and\nU.S. businesses. This neo-imperialism continues for much Latin\nAmerica well into the 21st century, while the model was\nextended to new countries formed in Africa and Asia from the\ndeclining European empires after World War Two.\nSome Latin America countries had more success than others\nboosting their economies with world trade. Brazilian\nplantations still produce more coffee beans than any other\ncountry, but in the 19th century, more than half of all coffee\ncame from Brazil. But the country\u2019s economy was extremely\nsensitive to the world price and rate of consumption; and when\nthe occasional frost in southern Brazil damaged the coffee\nbushes, planters could go bankrupt.\nBrazilian coffee also\naffected politics and human\nrights. Brazil was the last\ncountry in the hemisphere to\nabolish slavery, but it\nachieved this change without\na bloody Civil War. In the 18th\ncentury, enslaved labor was\nshifted from declining sugar\ncane plantations in northern\nBrazil to silver mining\ndistricts in the south. As the\nmines were beginning to\ndeplete in the late 18th\ncentury, planters discovered\nThe Lei \u00c1urea (Golden Act) that ended that coffee grew well in the\nslavery in Brazil. By then it had imported an highlands of southern Brazil,\nestimated 4,000,000 slaves from Africa, or\nand again, the large\n40% of all slaves shipped to the Americas.\nlandowners used enslaved\nlabor to cultivate the bean. The bloody War of the Triple\nAlliance, in which Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil fought\nParaguay over borders from 1866 to 1870, contributed to the end\nof slavery. Desperate for soldiers, the Brazilian government\noffered freedom to enslaved men if they served in the army.\nImpressed with the ability and dedication of these soldiers, 250 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmany army officers began to feel that slavery should end in their\ncountry. The institution was gradually fading anyway, because\ncoffee cultivation used less labor than either sugar plantations\nor mines. By 1880, nearly three quarters of all people of color in\nBrazil were free. King Pedro II finally abolished the institution\nin 1888; a year later, he abdicated and the military organized a\nrepublic.\nAs noted in the last chapter, Chile controlled over 80% of the\nworld\u2019s nitrates in the 1880s, making it a serious power in the\nPacific. After the War of the Pacific, the Chilean Navy controlled\nthe west coast of South America, Central America, and was even\na threat to U.S. interests. In 1885, when a rebellion broke out\nin the Colombian province of Panam\u00e1, the U.S. government\nsent ships and troops to both sides of the isthmus to protect\nthe railroad owned by North American investors. The Chilean\ngovernment send its British-built armored cruiser Esmeralda\n(the fastest ship in the world when launched the year before)\nto the Pacific side of Panam\u00e1, to send a message that it would\nprevent any annexation of the isthmus by the U.S. Whatever its\nintentions, the U.S. government withdrew its navy and troops\nafter the rebellion had calmed, as U.S. naval observers opined\nthat the mighty Esmeralda could sink every ship in the U.S.\nnavy at the time. The incident contributed to the building of\na more effective U.S. navy in the ensuing years. The sense of\nvulnerability also intensified U.S. interest in a canal through the\nisthmus of Panama, which had been begun in 1881 by a French\nconsortium led by Ferdinand de Lesseps (the man behind the\nSuez Canal).\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How is neo-imperialism different from the previous types?\n\u2022 Why was the U.S. concerned about Chile\u2019s naval dominance\nin the Pacific? Modern World History 251\nU.S. Imperialism\nAfter the Latin American\nindependence wars in 1830,\nthe Spanish Crown still\nmaintained control over\nCuba and Puerto Rico in the\nCaribbean and the Philippine\nIslands in the Pacific. With\nthe end of slavery,\nindependence inspired\nCubans, including a few from\nthe planter class. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, a\nCuban intellectual and poet,\norganized funds and support\nin the United States for a new\npush to liberate his Statue of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed on horseback in New\nYork\u2019s Central Park\nhomeland, and a new\nrebellion began in 1895. Mart\u00ed\ndied in his first battle, but the independence army continued\nwith guerrilla tactics in their fight against the Spanish. The\nSpanish set up concentration camps for non-combatants,\nassuming that anyone who did not submit was an independence\nsympathizer. Thousands died in terrible conditions in these\ncamps.\nMajor newspapers soon engaged in sensationalist reporting\non Spain\u2019s crimes in Cuba in order to increase circulation.\nMedia magnates William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer\nused what became known as yellow journalism to agitate for\nwar. Yellow journalism, named after a popular cartoon\ncharacter, \u201cYellow Kid\u201d, is the technique of using inflammatory\nheadlines backed by little or no factual reporting to stir up\npublic emotion, a combination of the click-bait and fake news\nthat is common on the Internet today. It\u2019s ironic that Pulitzer\nis now best known for the prize for journalistic excellence he\nestablished in his will.\nAt the beginning of 1898, public opinion in the US was divided\nover entering the Cuban war for independence. Still, the\nMcKinley administration was alarmed enough about instability 252 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\non the island that it sent the battleship Maine to Havana in order\nto protect U.S. interests. These were plentiful: U.S. investors and\nbuyers controlled the all-important sugar industry, they built\nand owned much of the communications and transportation\ninfrastructure, and U.S. smokers were the main consumers of\nCuban cigars. The Maine mysteriously blew up in Havana\nharbor, killing scores of U.S. soldiers. The Spanish were\nimmediately blamed by the sensationalist U.S. press (decades\nlater, investigations showed that the explosion came from the\ninside and was an accident: the munitions room was located\nalongside the engine room!). President McKinley asked for and\nthe U.S. Congress granted a declaration of war on Spain. The\nconflict quickly eliminated the Spanish Empire\u2019s control of\nCuba and Puerto Rico. Theodore Roosevelt, Secretary of the\nNavy at the time, formed his own army unit he called the Rough\nRiders so that he would not miss out on the \u201csplendid little war\u201d\nin Cuba. However, Black troops from the regular army had to\nsave him and his men at the Battle of San Juan Hill. Modern World History 253\nWilliam H. West\u2019s Big Minstrel Jubilee was one of several traveling shows to\nmemorialize the dramatic \u201cCharge of San Juan Hill\u201d, adding to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s\nfame.\nThe most important fighting of the ten-week war was really\nat sea. The U.S. navy sank the Spanish fleet in the Caribbean\nand in the Philippines, denying any possibility of the arrival\nof reinforcements and war materiel from Spain. At the end of\n1898, the Spanish Crown agreed to Cuban independence and\nhanded over Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the\nU.S. Cuba Libre (\u201cFree Cuba\u201d) was shouted for years by Cuban\nnationalists. Appropriately, it became the name for the classic\nbar drink \u201crum-and-coke\u201d in Spanish-speaking countries: the\ncombination of U.S. Coca Cola and Cuban rum. However, Cuba\nwas far from \u201cfree\u201d after the war, since the U.S. government\ndemanded the right to intercede in the internal affairs of the\nisland for any reason. The infamous \u201cPlatt Amendment\u201d was\nforced into the constitution of the new Cuban republic, and\nU.S. Marines were indeed sent in periodically to change\ngovernments or put down rebellions, real or imagined. U.S.\ninvestors were particularly leery of increased Afro-Cuban\nparticipation in politics, projecting their own racism onto the\naffairs of the island. 254 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMeanwhile, the U.S.\nannexed Puerto Rico and\nGuam, which are still U.S.\nterritories, as well as the\nPhilippines. Filipinos had\nalready been fighting a war\nfor independence since 1892,\nso they objected to becoming\na possession of the U.S.\nEmilio Aguinaldo, the\nFilipino leader, had been\npromised the US would\nrecognize the independence\nof the Philippine Republic,\nbut when the time came,\nPresident McKinley issued a\nEmilio Aguinaldo (1869\u20131964), first\nproclamation of \u201cbenevolent\npresident of the Philippines, photographed\nabout 1919. assimilation.\u201d Rudyard\nKipling\u2019s famous 1899 poem,\n\u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden,\u201d was written in support of the U.S.\neffort to subdue the ungrateful brown people of the Philippines.\nThe U.S. Navy destroyed the city of Iloilo to suppress the\nindependence movement, and Aguinaldo called for a strategy of\nguerrilla warfare. 4,200 American soldiers were killed in the\nconflict and about 250,000 Filipino soldiers and civilians. In\n1901, Aguinaldo was captured and forced to surrender.\nResistance continued until 1913, but by 1902 most of the\nguerrillas had been pushed way from major cities. The\nPhilippines finally achieved independence in 1946, after World\nWar Two (which included wartime occupation by Imperial\nJapan). Modern World History 255\nEditorial cartoon \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden\u201d shows John Bull (Great Britain) and Uncle\nSam (U.S.) delivering ungrateful colored peoples of the world to civilization.\nThe Spanish-American War also highlighted the military\nimportance of building a canal in Panam\u00e1. The U.S. Pacific Fleet,\nafter defeating the Spanish in the Philippines, had to sail around\nSouth America to engage Spain in the Caribbean. The California\nGold Rush had brought the Colombian province of Panam\u00e1 to\nthe attention of investors. Steamships from East Coast ports\nbrought passengers to Panam\u00e1, who, by 1855, could take a U.S.-\nbuilt and -owned railway to the Pacific side, embarking onto\nother steamers for the trip up to California. In 1902 the U.S.\ngovernment bought the French canal company\u2019s land for $40\nmillion. Although the French project managed to do some of\nthe most difficult digging, they had abandoned the project\nseveral years earlier. Ferdinand De Lessups had planned a sea-\nlevel canal, like the Suez in Egypt, but the hilly topography\nmade locks more practical, while the tropical jungles meant\nmalaria for canal workers. 256 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nColombia was ending yet\nanother civil war in 1902, and\nalthough the Colombian\ngovernment signed a treaty\nhanding over a canal zone\nand other rights to the U.S.,\nthe Colombian senate\n1903 New York Times political cartoon,\nhesitated to approve the\ncommenting on the U.S. interests driving\nagreement. Panamanians the \u201cliberation\u201d of Panama from Colombia.\nwere upset at the delay, and it\ndid not take much for the U.S. to help engineer the\nindependence of Panama, sending a naval destroyer to\ndiscourage the Colombian government from sending troops.\nAlmost immediately, the new government of Panama signed the\nCanal Zone over to the U.S. The Canal, opened in 1914, was an\nimpressive engineering feat, shortening the trip for cargo\nbetween the oceans. The U.S. medical service, with the help of\nCuban researchers, also made the connection between\nmosquitoes and malaria, and were able to check the spread of\nboth while building the canal. The U.S. withdrew from the Canal\nZone and the canal became Panamanian property on Dec. 31,\n1999. The canal was expanded in 2016 to accommodate\nPanamax container ships, and currently about 13,000 ships pass\nthrough the canal annually carrying over 330 million tons of\ncargo.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did \u201cfake news\u201d contribute to history in the early 20th\ncentury?\n\u2022 Can the United States approach to regions like the\nPhilippines and Panama be considered a new expression of\nManifest Destiny?\nBananas began as a major Central American industry when\na Cape Cod sea captain named Lorenzo Dow Baker bought Modern World History 257\n160 bunches in Jamaica in 1870 and resold them in Jersey City.\nThe delicious fruit quickly caught on with U.S. consumers. In\n1873 Minor C. Keith began planting banana trees alongside his\nrailroad in Costa Rica. The government had defaulted on some\npayments to Keith, but instead gave him 800,000 acres of tax-\nfree land along the rail line. When the railroad failed to pay for\nitself in the 1890s, Keith concentrated on bananas. He merged\nwith Baker\u2019s Boston Fruit Company, which was growing\nbananas on about 10,000 acres in Jamaica. The United Fruit\nCompany was the result, established in 1899. U.F.C. quickly\nbought up several competitors and gained control of 80% of the\nbananas reaching the U.S.\nIn 1901, American author O.\nHenry coined the term\n\u201cbanana republic\u201d in his book\nCabbages and Kings, inspired\nby a visit to Honduras in 1897.\nHis point was that companies\nlike the U.F.C. didn\u2019t limit\nthemselves to bananas. In\n1900 the company began a\ntravel service to Central\nAmerica on its steamers and\nproduced an illustrated travel\nguide called The Golden\nCaribbean. In 1901 the\ngovernment of Guatemala\ncontracted with U.F.C. to run\nthe nation\u2019s postal service. In\nAn illustration from the United Fruit\n1913 U.F.C. created the\nCompany\u2019s travel book, The Golden\nCaribbean, 1900. Tropical Radio and Telegraph\nCompany, and by 1930 U.F.C.\nwas worth over $200 million and was the largest employer in\nCentral America. The company owned over 3.5 million acres of\nland, making it the largest landowner in Guatemala. In 1928\nwhen a strike at U.F.C. plantations in Colombia was portrayed\nby the company as a potential communist insurrection, the U.S.\nMarines threatened to invade Colombia if the government did\nnot defend the U.F.C. Colombian soldiers massacred workers 258 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nstriking for an 8-hour day and a six-day work week. Hundreds\nwere killed, including dozens gathered in a town plaza in\nsupport of the strike. This 1928 Banana Massacre was described\nby Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez in his 1967 novel One Hundred Years\nof Solitude.\nIn 1933, Sam Zemurray (founder of the rival Cuyamel Fruit\nCompany) acquired U.F.C. in a hostile takeover. Zemurray had\ngotten into the business in 1895 by buying overripe bananas\nfrom U.F.C. and selling them cheaply in New Orleans. In 1910\nZemurray bought 15,000 acres in Honduras and the following\nyear he conspired with a former president of Honduras and an\nAmerican mercenary general to depose the elected government\nand install a military regime friendlier to foreign business,\nespecially his. Zemurray had objected to a deal made by the\nprevious government that had granted the U.F.C. a monopoly\non Honduran bananas in exchange for U.F.C. brokering U.S.\nGovernment loans to Honduras. The general who led the coup\nbecame commander of the Honduran Army and was later\nappointed U.S. Consul to Honduras.\nIn 1934 members of the banana workers union in Costa Rica\nbegan a national strike that spread to thirty other unions. The\nU.F.C. tried to divide workers and their salaries based on\nprofessional or ethnic differences, and even deported foreign\nworkers. The unions and the U.F.C. came to an agreement after\nabout a month, but the U.F.C. did not follow through on its\nagreements. Instead, the company began a public relations\ncampaign depicting the unions as communist revolutionaries,\nwith the backing of Costa Rica\u2019s government. When the union\nwent back on strike, its leaders were arrested. Modern World History 259\nThese interventions by U.S.\nbanana companies in the\ninternal affairs of the \u201cbanana\nrepublics\u201d mimicked the U.S.\nMarine occupations of several\nother countries in the\nCaribbean. Unrest and\ninstability in the region\nthreatened shipping lanes\nand the building and\nmaintenance of the Panam\u00e1\nCanal, so between 1903 and\n1933, the U.S. government\nsent troops to quell disorders\nin Nicaragua, the Dominican\nRepublic and Haiti.

The Trujillo\ndictatorship lasted until 1960 in the Dominican Republic, while\nthe Somoza family ruled Nicaragua until 1979. On a lighter note,\nthe Marines also introduced baseball into the countries they\noccupied; it is still the national sport of Cubans, Nicaraguans,\nand Dominicans.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did U.S. corporations feel they could do what they\npleased in Latin America and the Caribbean?\nThe European \u201cScramble for Africa\u201d\nThe European scramble for Africa at the end of the 19th century\nwas motivated by international rivalry and by the fact that 260 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAfrica south of the Sahara remained the last part of the world\n\u201cunexplored\u201d by Europeans. South Asia was part of the British\nEmpire, East Asia and Oceania were divvied up, and the\nAmericas were either already colonized or had established\nrepublics whose existence was accepted by Europeans and the\nU.S. The rivalries among the Europeans were based on the\ndesire to create captive consumer markets for their\nmanufactures and to secure resources like copper, tin, cotton,\nrubber, palm oil, tea, cocoa, and coffee upon which their\nindustries depended.\nComparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913, showing how the Scramble for Africa\naffected the continent.\nAfter the British began enforcing an end to the Atlantic slave\ntrade in 1808, European contact with most of sub-Saharan\nAfrica consisted of trade for ivory and other goods at a handful\nof trading posts. Belgian King Leopold and the new German\nEmpire began the scramble in the 1870s, sending explorers to\nclaim African territory, much like the Spanish in the Americas\n350 years before. The Portuguese in Africa defended their pre-\nexisting arrangements, while the British and French began to\nrush deeper into the continent. The Europeans made\nagreements with many local kings and chieftains and went to\nwar with others, always seeking a pledge of loyalty to their\nparticular empire. Modern World History 261\nTo bring order to the\n\u201cscramble\u201d, German\nChancellor Otto von\nBismarck in 1884 organized a\nconference to delineate\nclaims. The Berlin\nConference was attended by\nrepresentatives from 13\nEuropean powers plus the\nThe conference of Berlin, where Europeans United States. No African\ndivided up Africa in 1884-5. countries were represented\nexcept for the Ottoman\nprovinces along the Mediterranean. Administrative boundaries\ndeliberately cut across existing political and ethnic boundaries,\nin some cases forcing warring groups to live and work together,\nin others dividing tribes and their allies. This weakened\nresistance in the short run, but, as will be examined in a later\nchapter, became a source of civil unrest, separatist movements,\nand boundary disputes among the new African countries\nformed in the 1950s and 60s. 262 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAlong with the usual\nproposal of \u201ccivilizing\u201d the\nnon-European peoples of\ntheir empires, the\nimperialists also claimed that\nthey were committed to\nending the internal slave\ntrade. However, European\ntreatment of African laborers\noften included whipping,\ntorture, and other\npunishments, alongside debt\npeonage. It was standard\npractice in the so-called\n\u201cCongo Free State\u201d (really the\npersonal fiefdom of King\nLeopold of Belgium) to cut off A photo of mutilated Congolese children,\nthe hands of African workers from \u201cKing Leopold\u2019s Soliloquy: A Defense\nof His Congo Rule\u201d, published by Mark\nwho did not meet their\nTwain in 1905.\nrubber collection quotas. The\ninternational outcry over such practices forced the Belgian\ngovernment to finally take over Leopold\u2019s holdings in 1908, after\nthirty years of brutal rule.\nSouth Africa was a special case in European imperialism: the\nDutch made it into a \u201csettler colony\u201d beginning in the\nmid-1600s, rather than merely establishing a trading post. They\nwere interesting in forming a community of farmers that could\nsupply the fleets rounding the Cape of Good Hope on their way\nto the East Indies. Thousands of Dutch and other Europeans\nwere attracted by the relatively cooler climate of southern\nAfrica and plentiful arable land; and like the British and the\nUnited States in North America, they were more interested in\nremoving the natives rather than subjugating them.\nThe British took control of the territory from the Dutch\nduring the Napoleonic period. In the 1830s, the imperial\ngovernment began abolishing slavery and requiring English in\nschools and in legal transactions. In reaction, many Dutch Modern World History 263\nsettlers moved farther inland in the \u201cGreat Trek\u201d, taking more\nland from the natives and establishing two republics, Transvaal\nand the Orange Free State. At the same time, the descendants of\nunions between Europeans, Africans, and natives of the Dutch\nEast Indies brought in as laborers (collectively known as\n\u201ccoloured\u201d) occasionally established their own autonomous\nregions.\nThe British also faced the\nZulus, who, led by their\nextraordinary leader Shaka\nZulu and his well-trained\narmy, had established an\nindependent kingdom in\neastern South Africa in the\n1820s. When local British\ncommanders decided to\nattack a growing military\nthreat from the Zulus in 1879,\nthe imperial regiments were\ndefeated by Zulu troops in a\nseries of major battles. A\nsecond invasion of Zululand\nwas successful, but the British\nSketch of King Shaka (1781-1828) from\n1824. continued to recognize Zulu\nautonomy in much of their\nterritory.\nThe descendants of the Dutch settlers called themselves\n\u201cBoers\u201d (the Dutch word for \u201cfarmer\u201d) and successfully repelled\na British invasion in 1881. They were defeated in the Second\nBoer War (1899-1902), after a bloody conflict that included a\nwide guerrilla war and concentration camps for Boer civilians.\nA young Winston Churchill, the future Prime Minister of Great\nBritain, went to South Africa as a journalist to report on the war,\nand instead was captured by the Boers. Churchill escaped and\nhis story of heroism helped launch his career in British politics.\nThe Germans, who held territory bordering South Africa,\nsupported the Boers in the conflict, adding to the accumulating 264 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndisagreements between the governments of Great Britain and\nGermany on the eve of World War One.\nSoon after, in 1910, the British organized the Union of South\nAfrica, including the Boers as equal citizens, while continuing\nto deny such equality to the coloured and native groups (nearly\n85% of the population). This new Union was effectively an\nautonomous dominion within the British Empire, much like\nCanada.\nCecil John Rhodes is now\nprobably most remembered\nfor the scholarship he\nendowed in his will in 1902\nthat funds study at Oxford for\nU.S. college graduates.\nRhodes Scholars include Bill\nClinton, Rachel Maddow,\nBobby Jindal, and Kris\nKristofferson. Rhodes\nScholarships do a lot for the\nmemory of Cecil Rhodes, just\nas the Nobel Prize does a lot\nfor the memory of Alfred\nNobel, the inventor of\ndynamite whose company \u201cThe Rhodes Colossus\u201d cartoon, published\nafter Rhodes announced plans for a\noperated over 90 munitions\ntelegraph line from Cape Town to Cairo in\nfactories during his lifetime. 1892.\nRhodes endowed the\nscholarship at Oxford because the British University was his\nalma mater. The son of a well-connected Anglican minister,\nRhodes joined his brother in 1871 in South Africa at age 18, to\nrecuperate from tuberculosis. He dabbled in farming and then,\nfinanced by the Rothschild bank that had helped Britain buy the\nSuez Canal, began buying diamond mines. Rhodes returned to\nEngland to attend Oxford, but left after a year to resume his\ndiamond business, eventually founding the De Beers Company\nin 1888. A year later, Rhodes controlled 90% of the world\u2019s\ndiamond production. De Beers currently operates in 35\ncountries and held onto its monopoly until the start of the Modern World History 265\n21st century. The company still sells about 35% of the world\u2019s\ndiamonds.\nDuring his year at Oxford, Rhodes absorbed the philosophy of\nimperialism. He attended a lecture by professor John Ruskin\nthat became a famous justification for empire, called \u201cImperial\nDuty.\u201d Ruling the world, Ruskin said, \u201cis a destiny now possible\nto us\u2014the highest ever set before a nation to be accepted or\nrefused.\u201d Rhodes took this idea back to Africa, and once declared\n\u201cWe are the finest race in the world and the more of the world\nwe inhabit the better it is for the human race\u201d As noted, the\nBritish were not the only people who believed themselves to\nbe superior to the people they conquered. Europeans and the\nAmericans also believed it was their job to help \u201ccivilize\u201d the\nrest of the world. The \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Burden\u201d and the \u201cCivilizing\nMission\u201d of imperialism were big themes \u2013 we still call countries\nin what was once described as the \u201cthird world\u201d as \u201c developing\nnations,\u201d as if the goal of all the nations in the world is to become\nlike Europe and the United States, who have a responsibility to\nhelp them do just that.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What caused Europeans to believe they could meet in Berlin\nand divide Africa between themselves?\n\u2022 Did the actions of Europeans in Africa support the argument\nthat their mission was to \u201ccivilize\u201d the African people? 266 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nIn reality, the superiority\nthe British, French, and\nAmericans had over the\npeople of \u201cless developed\u201d\nnations was mostly in\nmilitary technology. Britain\ndemonstrated the\neffectiveness of armored\nsteamships during the Opium\nWars. They sailed up the\nYangzi River and threatened\nthe Grand Canal and Beijing,\nforcing the Chinese to\nsurrender and agree to the\nunequal treaty. In the 1870s\nPatent drawing for R. J. Gatling\u2019s \u201cbattery the British began using\ngun\u201d, 1865.\nGatling hand-cranked\nmachine guns against the Zulu in Africa and the Bedouin in the\nMiddle East. The Royal Navy used them against the Egyptians\nin 1882 during Egypt\u2019s civil war. The US used them to support\nAmerican troops during the Battle of San Juan Hill when Teddy\nRoosevelt and his Rough Riders made their famous charge.\nLater the British switched to the Maxim gun, which was the\nfirst recoil-operated machine gun and was able to fire 600\nrounds per minute. They used it in the 1890s to conquer the\nNdebele kingdom in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Cecil Rhodes,\nwho was by this time Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, had\nabout 750 South Africa Company Police against 80,000 tribal\nspearmen and 20,000 riflemen. But they had Maxim Guns. In\none battle, the British used Maxim Guns to \u201cfight off\u201d 5,000\nattacking Zulu warriors. In 1898 the British were able to kill\n20,000 Sudanese warriors with four Maxim Guns in a few hours\nwithout taking many casualties. This was the beginning of a\nperiod of asymmetrical warfare based on technology that\ncontinues to the present \u2013 and forced people who could not\nstand up to the imperialists\u2019 superior weapons to find other ways\nto resist.\nIn addition to weapons and transportation, Europeans and\nAmericans had the added advantage of communications. Modern World History 267\nTelegraphs using Morse code became widespread in the U.S.,\nBritain, and Europe during the 1850s, but undersea cables were\nrequired to connect the colonies. Before telegraphy, a letter\nfrom London took about two weeks to reach New York or\nAlexandria Egypt, a month to reach Bombay on the west coast\nof India, six weeks to reach Singapore or Calcutta on the East\nside of India, two months to get to Shanghai and ten weeks\nto arrive in Sidney Australia. A successful undersea cable line\nbetween Britain and the US was completed in 1866, and Britain\nand India were connected in 1870. Australia was linked to the\nsystem in 1872 and a trans-Pacific cable was completed in 1903\nlinking the U.S. with Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines.\nAlthough telegraphy had been pioneered by Americans like\nSamuel Morse, the British dominated undersea cable. At the\nend of the 19th century, Britain owned 24 of the world\u2019s 30\ncable-laying ships and the British owned and operated 2/3 of\nthe world\u2019s cable. During World War I, British telegraph\ncommunications were almost completely uninterrupted while\nBritain was very successful cutting German cables, forcing the\nGermans to rely on wireless (radio) transmissions that were easy\nto listen and decipher. 268 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nChart of submarine telegraph cable routes, showing the global reach of\ntelecommunications at the beginning of the 20th century.\nEuropeans treated their military success over colonized people\nas proof of their cultural superiority. They developed theories\nof scientific racism and Social Darwinism to justify their choice\nto treat conquered peoples as less than fully human. They also\ntook advantage of previous African customs and tribal\nanimosities to divide the conquered Africans, or created new\nones based on their own prejudices. In Rwanda, the Belgians\nnoted the existence of separate castes that lived side-by-side for\ngenerations under the same rule. However, the Belgians decided\nto put the cattle-raising Tutsis, ten percent of the population,\nover the Hutu farmers. Because of more access to animal\nprotein, the Tutsis seemed taller and better-looking to the\nEuropeans and were deemed to be naturally superior to the\nHutus. After independence, the Hutus took control and\nsubjected the Tutsis to periodic pogroms. In 1994, nearly a\nmillion Tutsis were killed by their neighbors in a government-\norchestrated genocide, until a largely Tutsi-led guerrilla\ninsurgency took over the government. Both groups speak the\nsame language, and the distinctions fostered by the Belgians Modern World History 269\nhave officially disappeared. However, in the aftermath up to 2\nmillion Hutu refugees fled Rwanda for the Congo, exacerbating\nthe humanitarian crisis and destabilizing central Africa even\nfurther.\nOil was first drilled by a\nRussian engineer on the\nApsheron Peninsula on the\nwest side of the Caspian Sea\nnear Baku, Azerbaijan in 1848.\nEdwin Drake\u2019s famous well in\nTitusville, Pennsylvania, was\ndrilled 11 years later in 1859.\nAlthough Russian fields and\nOil wells in Baku, Azerbaijan.

But by the end of the 19th century the Russian\nEmpire had taken back the lead in production. By the first\ndecade of the 20th century, commercial oil production was\nunderway in Sumatra, Persia, Peru, Venezuela, and Mexico, as\nwell as Texas, California, and Ohio. In the early twentieth\ncentury, the corporations dominating the global oil business\nwere Standard Oil (later Exxon, est. 1870), The Anglo-Persian Oil\nCompany (later British Petroleum, est. 1909), and Royal Dutch\nShell (est. 1907).\nOil initially played a fairly simple role in the Industrial\nRevolution as a machine lubricant. However, by the late 19th\ncentury, internal combustion engines, which relied on firing\ncylinders using gasoline or heavy oil (diesel) as fuel, were\nquickly becoming more efficient, replacing steam-power in\ntransportation. Diesel-fired ship and train engines, for instance,\ncarried less fuel than needed for coal-fired steam engines, while\nthe gasoline-powered automobile quickly became\ncommonplace by the second decade of the twentieth century. 270 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA 2017 map of world oil reserves. The greatest reserves are in Saudi Arabia and\nVenezuela.\nAs oil became increasingly central to powering industry and\ntransportation, oil companies became more powerful and were\nable to project their economic influence to shape the politics of\nthe countries they operated in. This became especially true in\nthe Arabian Peninsula, which until the discovery of oil had been\na sparsely-populated desert. Today, about 80% of the world\u2019s\nreadily-accessible oil reserves are located in the Middle East.\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, and the U.S. are the three largest\nproducers.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did technology widen the gap between imperial powers\nand those they conquered?\n\u2022 How does the division of the world into \u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cless-\ndeveloped\u201d regions influence international relations today? Modern World History 271\nChina and Japan\nFinally, as we always do,\nlet\u2019s look at what was\nhappening in the world\u2019s\nbiggest nation. The Chinese\nEmpire continued its decline,\nas Europeans continued their\npresence in assigned trading\nports, divvying up Chinese\nterritory into \u201cspheres of\ninfluence\u201d in which\ncommerce and Christian\nmissionary activity was\ncontrolled by a particular\nEuropean power. By the\n1890s, however, China also\nfaced the rapidly\n\u201cChina \u2013 the cake of kings and\u2026of\nindustrializing Japanese\nemperors\u201d, a French political cartoon from\n1898 depicting the Great Powers cutting up Empire. In less than thirty\nthe Chinese cake. years, the Japanese\nreconstructed their\ngovernment, initiated industrial activity, and built up their\nmilitary through conscription and the latest weapons and ship\ntechnology. However, the Japanese home islands lacked deposits\nof key industrial inputs, chiefly coal, iron ore, and oil. To acquire\nguaranteed resources and markets, the Japanese government\nbegan to play the imperial game, following the rules established\nby the Europeans. Like the British in India and China, Japanese\ncommerce laid claim to their own \u201csphere of influence\u201d in\nChinese territory, and claimed sovereignty over tributary states.\nThe brief Sino-Japanese War in 1895 ended with the Qing\nEmpire granting the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan to Japan, and\nceding trading rights in Korea and Manchuria.\nAt the end of the 19th century, a final conflict with the West\nwould pave the way for radical change and the end of the Qing\nEmpire in China. The Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) was an anti-\ncolonial, anti-Christian revolt led by martial artists who called\nthemselves the Righteous Fists, or \u201cBoxers\u201d by Westerners. The 272 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBoxers, believing they were impervious to foreign weapons,\nmarched into Beijing intending to help the imperial\ngovernment exterminate the foreigners. An eight-nation\nalliance, which included European nations, the U.S., and Japan,\nsent 20,000 troops to fight the Boxers. The foreign soldiers\nfreed the legations besieged in the capital, but they also looted\nBeijing and the surrounding countryside and summarily\nexecuted anyone suspected of being a Boxer. The Qing\ngovernment agreed to pay an indemnity of 450 million taels of\nsilver to the allies (worth about $10 billion today).\nIn another political cartoon from 1899, Uncle Sam clutches a \u201cTrade Treaty with China\u201d\nand says: \u201cGentleman, you may cut up this map as much as you like, but remember\nthat I\u2019m here to stay, and that you can\u2019t divide me up into spheres of influence\u201d.\nThe abject state of the Qing dynasty and the increasing regional\npower of Japan set the scene for China to become a battlefield\nfor territorial conflicts between Russia, Japan, and the United\nStates. The United States acquired the Philippine Islands from\nSpain after the 1898 war, and immediately began projecting its\nown political and commercial power into East Asia. Coming\nlate to the imperial game in China, the United States sought to\nlimit the existing \u201cspheres of influence\u201d and prevent new ones\nfrom being imposed by either Russia or Japan. U.S. diplomats Modern World History 273\nadvocated an \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d in China, in which the Qing\nEmpire would not limit any commercial activity by outside\npowers.\nIn 1900, Russia occupied Manchuria and came into conflict\nwith Japanese interests on the Korean peninsula, leading to the\nRusso-Japanese War of 1904-5. After the Japanese navy sank the\nmain battleships of Russia\u2019s Pacific fleet in the Battle of Port\nArthur and held off the Russian army, the world realized the\npower of an organized and industrialized Japan; forcing the\nEuropeans and Americans to consider the Japanese Empire as\nan equal, while inspiring non-European colonized peoples that\nthe Europeans were not always invincible in war.\nFrom the Russian side,\nhowever, defeat by the\nJapanese on the battlefield\nand on the seas was not only\nhumiliating, but highlighted\nthe ineffectiveness of the\nTsarist regime. At the Winter\nPalace in St. Petersburg in\nJanuary 1905, a major protest\nagainst the inept government\nended when the Palace guard\nfired upon the peaceful\ndemonstration, killing\nhundreds. This \u201cBloody\nSunday\u201d increased demands\nfor reform, including Crowd of petitioners, led by Orthodox\nwidespread support for a priest, Father Gapon, near Narva Gate, St.\nPetersburg, January 22, 1905.\nparliamentary monarch. In\nthe meantime, the Tsar sent most of the Russian Baltic Fleet to\nretake Port Arthur from the Japanese. Two thirds of the ships\nwere sunk by the Japanese Combined Fleet in the Battle of\nTsushima in May 1905. In October 1905, Tsar Nicolas II\nacquiesced to the formation of an elected parliament, the\nDuma, and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.\nHowever, he soon reneged granting full oversight powers to this 274 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nnew legislature, preferring to maintain himself as an absolute\nmonarch.\nHowever, the Tsar also\nagreed to end the unpopular\nwar with Imperial Japan.\nPeace between the Russians\nand Japanese was negotiated\nin Portsmouth, Maine, in the\nUnited States, highlighting\nthe increasing importance of\nU.S. interests in East Asia.\nPresident Theodore\nRoosevelt was awarded the\n1906 Nobel Peace Prize for\nhis role in ending the war.\nJapan took over Russia\u2019s\nPeace Treaty between Russia and Japan,\nsigned September 1905 in Portsmouth, \u201csphere of influence\u201d on\nNew Hampshire. China\u2019s Liaotung Peninsula\nand was recognized as the\nsole power in Korea, which became part of the Japanese Empire\nin 1910.\nThe Russo-Japanese War also once again highlighted the\nextent to which the Qing government in China was hardly\nconsidered a factor in international relations. Even though the\nwar concerned Chinese territory, Chinese armies were not\nseriously involved in the fighting; nor were Chinese negotiators\npresent at the Treaty of Portsmouth. By that time, the Qing\nempire was devolving into a series of warlord-controlled\nregions. Palace intrigues in the royal \u201cForbidden City\u201d in Beijing\nhad led to effective power being wielded by the Empress\nDowager Cixi for nearly five decades until her death in 1908.\nAlthough she at times embraced gradual reform of her\ngovernment and military and periodically protested European\nand Japanese incursions, she was realistic enough to understand\nher limits. More conservative forces took over in the palace\nin 1908, installing the five-year-old Prince Puyi as Emperor. It\nwas not long before modernizing forces soon overthrew the\ndecadent imperial system. Modern World History 275\nThe most inspirational\nleader of the modernizers was\nSun Yat-sen. Born in 1866, he\nmoved to the then-\nindependent Kingdom of\nHawaii, where an older\nbrother owned a farm, to\ncomplete is secondary\neducation at a U.S. missionary\nschool. Sun went on to study\nmedicine in Hong Kong and\nbegan advocating for the end\nof the Qing dynasty and the\nestablishment of a Chinese\nrepublic. Because of his\nopposition to the Qing, Sun\nPortrait of Sun Yat-Sen, 1911.\nlived in exile in Hawaii, Japan,\nand Malaysia, from where he\nformed the alliance which would end the Qing regime in the\nXinhai Revolution in 1911.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What were the main factors leading to China\u2019s inability to\nmodernize and resist European imperialism?\n\u2022 What was the role of the United States in Asia in the early\n20th century? 276 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPrimary Sources\n\u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden: The United States and the\nPhilippine Islands\u201d (1899), by Rudyard Kipling\nTake up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives\u2019 need;\nTo wait in heavy harness\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught, sullen peoples,\nHalf devil and half child.Take up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nIn patience to abide,\nTo veil the threat of terror\nAnd check the show of pride;\nBy open speech and simple,\nAn hundred times made plain.\nTo seek another\u2019s profit,\nAnd work another\u2019s gain.Take up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nThe savage wars of peace\u2014\nFill full the mouth of Famine\nAnd bid the sickness cease;\nAnd when your goal is nearest\nThe end for others sought,\nWatch Sloth and heathen Folly\nBring all your hopes to nought.\nTake up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nNo tawdry rule of kings,\nBut toil of serf and sweeper\u2014\nThe tale of common things.\nThe ports ye shall not enter,\nThe roads ye shall not tread,\nGo make them with your living,\nAnd mark them with your dead!\nTake up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nAnd reap his old reward:\nThe blame of those ye better,\nThe hate of those ye guard\u2014\nThe cry of hosts ye humour\n(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:\u2014 Modern World History 277\n\u201cWhy brought ye us from bondage,\nOur loved Egyptian night?\u201d\nTake up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nYe dare not stoop to less\u2014\nNor call too loud on Freedom\nTo cloak your weariness;\nBy all ye cry or whisper,\nBy all ye leave or do,\nThe silent, sullen peoples\nShall weigh your Gods and you.\nTake up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nHave done with childish days\u2014\nThe lightly proffered laurel,\nThe easy, ungrudged praise.\nComes now, to search your manhood\nThrough all the thankless years,\nCold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,\nThe judgment of your peers!\nCecil Rhodes, \u201cConfession of Faith\u201d, 1877\nIt often strikes a man to inquire\nwhat is the chief good in life; to\none the thought comes that it is a\nhappy marriage, to another great\nwealth, and as each seizes on his\nidea, for that he more or less\nworks for the rest of his existence.\nTo myself thinking over the same\nquestion the wish came to render\nmyself useful to my country. I then\nasked myself how could I and after\nreviewing the various methods I 278 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nhave felt that at the present day we\nare actually limiting our children\nand perhaps bringing into the\nworld half the human beings we\nmight owing to the lack of country\nfor them to inhabit that if we had\nretained America there would at\nthis moment be millions more of\nEnglish living. I contend that we\nare the finest race in the world and\nthat the more of the world we\ninhabit the better it is for the\nhuman race. Just fancy those parts\nthat are at present inhabited by the\nmost despicable specimens of\nhuman beings what an alteration\nthere would be if they were\nbrought under Anglo-Saxon\ninfluence, look again at the extra\nemployment a new country added\nto our dominions gives. I contend\nthat every acre added to our\nterritory means in the future birth to\nsome more of the English race\nwho otherwise would not be\nbrought into existence. Added to\nthis the absorption of the greater\nportion of the world under our rule\nsimply means the end of all wars,\nat this moment had we not lost\nAmerica I believe we could have\nstopped the Russian-Turkish war\nby merely refusing money and\nsupplies. Having these ideas what\nscheme could we think of to Modern World History 279\nforward this object. I look into\nhistory and I read the story of the\nJesuits I see what they were able\nto do in a bad cause and I might\nsay under bad leaders.\nAt the present day I become a\nmember of the Masonic order I see\nthe wealth and power they\npossess the influence they hold\nand I think over their ceremonies\nand I wonder that a large body of\nmen can devote themselves to\nwhat at times appear the most\nridiculous and absurd rites without\nan object and without an end.\nThe idea gleaming and dancing\nbefore ones eyes like a will-of-the-\nwisp at last frames itself into a\nplan. Why should we not form a\nsecret society with but one object\nthe furtherance of the British\nEmpire and the bringing of the\nwhole uncivilised world under\nBritish rule for the recovery of the\nUnited States for the making the\nAnglo-Saxon race but one Empire.\nWhat a dream, but yet it is\nprobable, it is possible. I once\nheard it argued by a fellow in my\nown college, I am sorry to own it\nby an Englishman, that it was good\nthing for us that we have lost the\nUnited States. There are some\nsubjects on which there can be no 280 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\narguments, and to an Englishman\nthis is one of them, but even from\nan American\u2019s point of view just\npicture what they have lost, look at\ntheir government, are not the\nfrauds that yearly come before the\npublic view a disgrace to any\ncountry and especially their\u2019s\nwhich is the finest in the world.\nWould they have occurred had\nthey remained under English rule\ngreat as they have become how\ninfinitely greater they would have\nbeen with the softening and\nelevating influences of English\nrule, think of those countless 000\u2019s\nof Englishmen that during the last\n100 years would have crossed the\nAtlantic and settled and populated\nthe United States. Would they\nhave not made without any\nprejudice a finer country of it than\nthe low class Irish and German\nemigrants? All this we have lost\nand that country loses owing to\nwhom? Owing to two or three\nignorant pig-headed statesmen of\nthe last century, at their door lies\nthe blame. Do you ever feel mad?\ndo you ever feel murderous. I think\nI do with those men. I bring facts to\nprove my assertion. Does an\nEnglish father when his sons wish\nto emigrate ever think of\nsuggesting emigration to a country Modern World History 281\nunder another flag, never\u2014it would\nseem a disgrace to suggest such a\nthing I think that we all think that\npoverty is better under our own\nflag than wealth under a foreign\none.\nPut your mind into another train\nof thought.

However, the official peace covered a growing tension\nthat was beginning to flare up into military conflict. Unification\nof Germany in 1870, after the Prussian-led victory over the\nFrench, had created a new nation with imperial aspirations in\nthe middle of Europe. Bismarck\u2019s new nation competed with\nneighboring countries in industry, agriculture, and overseas\nempire-building. The existence of a strong, united Germany\nended the careful balance of power created by the Congress\nof Vienna in its effort to reset the clock and redraw the map\nafter the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. France and Germany were\nenemies and sought alliances against each other. By 1914, most\ngovernments in Europe were preparing for an eventual war\nbetween these groups of allied nations, although no one knew\nwhat incident would bring the continent to battle. But, as early\nas 1888, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had predicted\nthat \u201csome damned foolish thing in the Balkans\u201d could initiate\na widespread European conflict. He was proven correct on the\nstreets of Sarajevo on June 28, 1914.\nDuring World War One, the\nprincipal members of each of\nthese alliances were the\n\u201cCentral Powers\u201d, consisting\nof Germany, Austria-\nHungary, and the Ottoman\nEmpire against the \u201cAllied\nRival military coalitions in 1914: Allied Powers\u201d, which at the\nPowers (Triple Entente) in green, Central beginning of the war was\nPowers (Triple Alliance) in brown.\ncalled the \u201cTriple Entente\u201d\nafter the original allies,\nFrance, Great Britain, and Russia. Russia left the war in 1918,\nItaly joined the allies in 1915, and Japan was an additional ally on\nthe French side. The United States entered the war to support\nthe allies in 1917.\nThe underlying causes of World War One were nationalism,\nopposition to foreign rule, and simmering rivalries between\nthe Great Powers that were exacerbated by treaties requiring\nallies to enter a war once it began. Previously, potential world\nconflicts had been avoided through negotiation among the 288 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPowers. Africa was divided among the European empires at the\nBerlin Conference in 1885, while \u201cSpheres of Influence\u201d were\nestablished in China in order to regulate trade. However, such a\n\u201cConcert of Nations\u201d did not succeed in the Balkans.\nThe unification of Germany upset the balance of Europe. Not\nonly did the Deutsches Reich aspire to become an imperial power\nlike Britain, France, and Russia, it had rapidly built up its\nmilitary and industrial power. By the first two decades of the\ntwentieth century, Germany surpassed Britain to become the\nlargest economy in Europe and second in the world. German\nscientists won more Nobel Prizes than any other nation beside\nthe United States. And Germany\u2019s navy was racing to surpass\nBritain\u2019s.\nIn 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm II\ntook the imperial throne\nwhen both his grandfather\nand father died in rapid\nsuccession. Wilhelm I, the\nKing of Prussia whom\nBismarck had made an\nemperor, ruled until he was\n90. His grandson took the\nthrone at 29. Due to the\nelaborate intermarriages of\nthe European ruling families,\nWilhelm II was also the eldest\ngrandson of Queen Victoria\nof England. Perhaps taking\ninspiration from the British\nEmpire, Wilhelm II launched\nPortrait of Kaiser Wilhelm II, 1902.\nGermany on a \u201cNew Course\u201d\ntoward overseas imperialism. The Kaiser ordered his military\nleaders to read Alfred Thayer Mahan\u2019s book, The Influence of Sea\nPower upon History, which had also impressed Theodore\nRoosevelt in America. By 1914, the German navy was second\nonly to the British Royal Navy. The new emperor also dismissed\nBismarck as Chancellor in 1890 and began looking for ways to\nmake Germany a colonial empire, through a much more Modern World History 289\naggressive foreign policy than that envisioned by his chief\nadvisor.\nThe eighty-four-year old\nAustro-Hungarian Emperor\nFranz Josef had been reigning\nsince 1848. His nephew,\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand\n(age 50) was the Crown Prince\nand expected to soon become\nthe next Emperor. In the area\nof western Europe between\nthe Mediterranean and the\nBlack Sea called the Balkan\nPeninsula, the Austro-\nHungarian, the Russian, and\nthe Ottoman empires each\nclaimed control. As described\nin the previous chapter, the\n\u201cThe boiling point\u201d, a cartoon published in\nPunch in October 1912. Ottomans had gradually been\nlosing power in Europe since\nthe 1700s. By the end of the nineteenth century, newly-\nindependent nations of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Montenegro\nand Serbia separated the Muslim Ottomans from the Catholic\nAustro-Hungarians. The Orthodox Russians dreamed of\nreestablishing Constantinople in Istanbul, and felt a kinship\nwith their fellow Orthodox Slavs, the Serbs and Bulgarians.\nThe Balkan conflict Bismarck had predicted began in 1908\nwith the Austro-Hungarian takeover of Bosnia from the\nOttoman Empire. Many Serbs lived in Bosnia, so Serbian\nnationalists wanted it to be part of Serbia. The Serbs and\nBulgarians deepened their alliance with the Russians, who also\nwanted to check the expanding influence of the Austrians in the\nBalkans.\nThe independent nations of the Balkans fell into war in\n1912-1913, first with the Ottomans, resulting in an independent\nAlbania, and then with each other as ethnic and religious\nboundaries were contested. These were bloody conflicts that\nincluded attacks on civilian populations in waves of ethnic 290 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ncleansing\u2014people living in this region would experience\nsimilar massacres in the 1990s after the end of the Cold\nWar.

Was it\ninevitable?\n\u2022 Did the tangled relationships of European rulers contribute\nto stability or instability? Modern World History 291\nMany Europeans celebrated the start of the war, believing it would bring glory and\nimprove the standing of their nations.\nAll of Europe\u2019s armies had been preparing for a continent-\nwide conflict since the unification of Germany in 1870. Most\nnations required some form of military service from all young 292 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmen, so that thousands of trained reserve soldiers could be\nquickly called up. All war plans relied on the quick mobilization\nof troops, and the extensive European railway network built in\nthe nineteenth century moved regiments more rapidly than in\nany previous war. This rapid deployment meant that as soon as\none side mobilized, the opposing side also had to mobilize in\ndefense. Less time was available for calm decision-making as\nevery nation rushed to arms. In July 1914, when Austria declared\nwar and shelled the Serbian capital, Belgrade, Russia mobilized\nits military. Germany mobilized against Russia. Russia was\nallied with France, so France mobilized. Great Britain was allied\nwith France, so Great Britain mobilized. The Ottomans sided\nwith Germany as a counter to Russia. Italy, which had\na defensive alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, sat out\nof the first months of war, until its government decided to side\nwith France, Great Britain, and Russia in early 1915.\nBecause of the French-\nRussian alliance, the Germans\nknew that they would face a\ntwo-front war in any\nEuropean-wide\nconflict. Expecting to face\nenemies on Germany\u2019s\neastern and western borders,\nthe German generals had\nGerman soldiers in a railway supply train\non the way to the front in 1914. Early in the been planning for years to\nwar, all sides expected the conflict to be a initially fight a defensive war\nshort one.\nwith Russia in the east and an\noffensive war with France in\nthe west; holding off invading Russian armies while focusing on\ndefeating the French first.\nIn the first months of the war, the Germans were successful\nin carrying out their strategy. The German army on the eastern\nfront was able to stop and even defeat the advancing\nRussians. On the western front, the German government asked\npermission of neutral Belgium to pass through on their way\nto a surprise attack on France. When the Belgians rejected the\nrequest, German troops invaded and occupied Belgium in Modern World History 293\nAugust 1914. The Germans advanced rapidly into France, but\nwere halted by combined French and British forces, miles from\nParis. Both sides dug in, creating a network of opposing\ntrenches that ultimately extended from the North Sea to the\nSwiss border. Armies on both sides would be frustrated in their\nattempts to break through on this \u201cwestern front\u201d for the next\nfour years.\nAdvances in military\ntechnology caused the\nstalemate. The wars of the\nnineteenth century had been\nmobile, with generals\ncoordinating the movements\nof infantry foot-soldiers,\nhorse cavalry, and artillery\ncannons on the battle\nlandscape. However, conflicts\nlike the Crimean War and the\nU.S. Civil War had begun\nintroducing better, more\ndeadly weapons. The Charge\nof the Light Brigade had\nproven that cavalry was\nGerman soldiers of the 11th Reserve\nineffective against dug-in\nHussar Regiment fighting from a trench, on\nartillery. And in the last the Western Front, 1916.\ndecades of the nineteenth\ncentury, Europeans had perfected the use of machine guns,\npracticing on native populations in their colonies. By 1914 the\narmies of Europe had better weapons and better defenses: long-\nrange artillery, machine guns, trenches, and barbed wire. And\nthey were ready to use these on each other, rather than just on\nthe so-called \u201cbarbarians\u201d their empires ruled over.\nSince neither cavalry nor infantry could stand against\nmachine guns, attacks in trench warfare began with massive\nartillery barrages to \u201csoften\u201d the other side before troops were\nsent out of their trenches, \u201cover the top\u201d into the no-man\u2019s\nland between their trenches and those of the enemy, with fixed\nbayonets to overwhelm any enemy soldiers who had survived 294 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthe shelling. When their artillery had not \u201csoftened up\u201d the\nopposing forces enough, attackers would be met with enough\nmachine gun fire to slow down any effective advance. During\nfour long years of war, millions would either be severely\nwounded or killed in the \u201cno-man\u2019s-land\u201d that separated the\nopposing armies.\nAerial view of opposing trench lines between Loos and Hulluch, July 1917.

How would you react?\nFrustrated with the\nstalemate of trench warfare,\nthe opposing sides on the\nwestern front tried new\ntechnologies and strategies in\nsearch of a decisive\nFirst Serbian armed airplane, 1915. victory. Airplanes, first\ndeveloped by the Wright\nBrothers in 1903, proved their value in reconnaissance and later\nin strafing trenches with machine guns and dropping small\nbombs. Early radios allowed aviators to coordinate with ground\ncontrollers. And in the spring of 1915, the Germans first\nexperimented using poison gas on the battlefield. Within\nmonths, all sides would develop different varieties of poison gas,\nwhile racing to improve the designs of their gas masks. Poison\ngases added another devastating weapon to trench warfare,\nwhile achieving no significant advantage. At least 1.3 million\npeople were killed by gas attacks. Chlorine and mustard gas\nwere two of the most common chemical weapons used by both\nsides in the war. In the case of mustard gas poisoning, the effects\ntook 24 hours to begin and it could take four to five weeks to die.\nGerman development of poisonous chlorine gas and its first\nuse were supervised by Fritz Haber, a scientist who won the\nNobel Prize for co-inventing the Haber-Bosch process for\nsynthesizing nitrogen from the atmosphere. After 67,000 troops\nwere killed and wounded by the gas in its first use in April\n1915, Haber\u2019s wife, the scientist Clara Immerwahr, killed herself\nwith his service revolver in protest. Poison gases were heavier\nthan air, so they settled into low areas like trenches, but also 296 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsometimes rolled into low-lying towns, killing and injuring\ncivilians.\nBritish emplacement after German gas attack, 1916.\nAirplanes and poison gas, alongside machine guns and massive\nartillery, simply became more cogs in the war\u2019s increasingly-\neffective killing machines. More people were killed, but without\nany change in the outcome of the war. Enormous battles raged\nfor months at a time at Verdun and the Somme in 1916, resulting\nin millions of casualties but hardly any territorial changes.\nThe conflict on the Eastern\nFront, where the Germans\nand Austro-Hungarians faced\nthe Russians, was more\nmobile. In 1916, as the\nmonths-long Battle of Verdun\nseemed to be going against\nRussian cavalry on the eastern front, 1916\nthe French, the Russian Army\noverwhelmed Austrian forces in the Brusilov Offensive, the\nlargest and most deadly of the war. Hundreds of thousands died\non both sides as the Russian army advanced, forcing the\nGermans to divert their forces from the Western Front. Austro-\nHungarian offensive capabilities were largely destroyed, but Modern World History 297\nRussian soldiers were also disillusioned and began to seriously\nquestion the competence and decisions of their officers and\ncommanders, including the Tsar himself.\nEven before the entry of the\nUnited States in 1918, the war\nhad become truly global.\nJapan was eager to be counted\nas a world power, and\nJapanese leaders seized upon\nthe opportunity the war\nprovided to improve their Japanese troops landing during the Battle\nstatus in Asia. After taking of Tsingtao, where they captured the\nGerman position.\ncontrol of German colonies in\nChina and the Pacific in 1914,\nJapan sent the Chinese government a list of 21 Demands. The\nChinese believed that giving in to Japan\u2019s demands would have\nbasically resulted in China becoming a colony of the Japanese\nEmpire. The Chinese government agreed to some of the\ndemands, but leaked the list to British diplomats, who\nintervened to prevent a complete shift in the balance of power\nin Asia.\nIn Africa, Germany lost its colonies in the fighting. The\nGerman commander in East Africa, led a largely native African\nforce in guerrilla tactics against Allied troops for most of the\nwar. In eastern Africa, disrupted crop cultivation and led to\nhundreds of thousands of deaths by starvation and disease.\nThe Ottoman Empire\ncontrolled territory on either\nside of Bosporus straits,\nwhich connect the Black Sea\nwith the Mediterranean.

However, the Turks held the high ground above the\nlanding site chosen for the mostly colonial troops. Australian\nand New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) troops were decimated,\nin a battle that marks the beginning of a sense of nationality\nin those countries. The anniversary of the Gallipoli landing,\nApril 25th, is still celebrated as ANZAC Day. The disastrous plan\nnearly ended the political career of the British First Lord of the\nAdmiralty, Winston Churchill.\nU.S. Ambassador Henry Morgenthau\u2019s caption: \u201cThose who fell by the wayside. Scenes\nlike this were common all over the Armenian provinces in the spring and summer\nmonths of 1915. Death in its several forms\u2014massacre, starvation,\nexhaustion\u2014destroyed the larger part of the refugees. The Turkish policy was that of\nextermination under the guise of deportation\u201d.\nThe eleven month-long Gallipoli invasion was even more\nimportant for the Turks. The hard-fought victory was led by\nGeneral Mustafa Kemal, who soon became a national hero and\nwould go on to found the modern Turkish Republic and serve\nas its first president after the war. However, at nearly the same\ntime as the Gallipoli landings, the Ottoman government also\ndecided to take action against the Christian minority in\nArmenia. Armenians had suffered from periodic pogroms in Modern World History 299\nthe decades preceding World War One. The Armenians were\nloyal subjects (many were serving in the army when the\npersecution began), but after an unsuccessful Russian attempt\nto invade Turkey from the east, some military leaders in the\nTurkish government accused the Armenians of collaborating\nwith the Russian troops and decided to eliminate the Armenian\npopulation. Men were executed, while women and children\nwere force-marched across the desert to Mesopotamia. Nearly\none million died in what was the worst genocide of the 20th\ncentury before the Holocaust of World War Two.\nThe imperial powers\ndrafted soldiers from their\ncolonies into the fight.

Indian divisions were also sent to\nGallipoli, Egypt, German East Africa, and Europe. At least\n74,000 Indians died in World War One.\nDespite all of the efforts for a breakthrough on the battlefields\nof France and Eastern Europe, the most effective strategy\nagainst Germany was the British-led naval blockade, which cut\noff grain and other food supplies from overseas. The Germans,\nwho had developed the most effective submarines and\ntorpedoes, tried to blockade Great Britain and France by sinking\nincoming supply ships. This German naval strategy, however,\nrisked bringing the United States into the war. After the sinking\nof the passenger ship Lusitania in May 1915, when a hundred\nU.S. citizens were drowned a few miles from the Irish coast, 300 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsome American public opinion began to shift in favor of\nentering the conflict. The German government quickly backed\naway from unrestricted submarine warfare against supply ships\nbound for the Great Britain and France.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did new technologies change the way war is fought?\n\u2022 Why did the Gallipoli invasion almost destroy Winston\nChurchill\u2019s political career?\n\u2022 What motivated the Armenian genocide?\nThe United States had a\nlong tradition of trying to\navoid being drawn into the\n\u201cGreat Powers\u201d conflicts of\nEurope. American attitudes\ntoward international affairs\nreflected the advice given by\nPresident George Washington\nJane Addams and other American activists in his 1796 Farewell Address,\nattending a peace conference in the\nto avoid \u201centangling alliances\u201d\nNetherlands, 1915.\nwith the Europeans. The\nMonroe Doctrine of 1823 had gone further to establish the\nWestern Hemisphere as the United States\u2019 area of interest,\nimplying that the U.S. did not intend to intrude in the affairs of\nEurope. However, although the U.S. did not participate in\ninternational diplomatic alliances, American businesses and\nconsumers benefited from the trade generated by nearly a\ncentury of European peace and the expansion of the\ntransatlantic economy.\nAdditionally, by the 1880s and 1890s, millions of Europeans\nemigrated to the United States to work in factories and mines,\nor to establish farms in the West. More Irish and Germans\narrived, and also Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, Poles, Ukrainians,\nItalians, and Jews from Eastern Europe. The U.S. needed and Modern World History 301\n(largely) welcomed the newcomers, while America served as\na \u201csafety valve\u201d for European nations with an excess of poor\nlandless peasants. The diversity among the immigrants in this\nAmerican \u201cmelting pot\u201d helped bolster the case for U.S.\nneutrality in European affairs even as the war began.\nA foreign policy of\nneutrality also reflected\nAmerica\u2019s focus on the\nbuilding of its new powerful\nindustrial economy, financed\nlargely with loans and\ninvestments from Europe and\nespecially London. However,\nU.S. dependency on foreign\ncapital began to change\nduring the war, when\nAmerican bankers began\nmaking substantial loans to\nBritain and France. John\nPierpont Morgan\u2019s successor,\nJ.P. Morgan Jr., who had spent\nthe early years of his career\nmanaging the family\u2019s bank\nin London, leveraged a\nJack Morgan walking alongside his father J.\nfriendship with British P. Morgan in the last known photograph of\nAmbassador Cecil Spring the two together (ca. 1913).\nRice to have the Morgan bank\ndesignated as the sole-source U.S. purchasing agent for both\nBritain and France. J.P. Morgan and Company managed the\nAllies\u2019 purchases of munitions, food, steel, chemicals, and\ncotton; receiving a 1% commission on all sales. Morgan led a\nconsortium of over 2,000 banks and managed loans to the Allies\nthat exceeded $500 million (nearly $13 billion in today\u2019s\ndollars). Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Secretary of State, the populist-\nleaning William Jennings Bryan, objected to the loans and\nargued that by denying financing to any of the belligerents, the\nU.S. could hasten the end of the war. But a quick end to the war\nwas not the bankers\u2019 goal. 302 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nJ.P. Morgan and Company\u2019s Managing Director, Thomas\nLamont, presented his views in a 1915 speech to the American\nAcademy of Political and Social Science. Lamont observed that\nthe war offered the United States a unique opportunity to shift\nfrom being a debtor nation, dependent on loans from Europe\nand Britain, to becoming a global creditor. \u201cWe are piling up\na prodigious export trade [with] war orders,\u201d he said, \u201crunning\ninto the hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d America was poised,\nLamont concluded, to become the trade and finance center\nof the world, and the U.S. dollar to replace the British pound\nsterling as the world\u2019s currency. But this would only happen,\nhe warned, \u201cif the war goes on long enough\u201d A quick end to\nhostilities would allow Germany to rapidly regain its\ncompetitive position. The best result for America would be a\nlong war that ended in German defeat and left the winners\ndeeply in debt to the United States.\nLamont\u2019s prediction came true. Wall Street, in New York City,\nbecame and remains the financial capital of world, with\ninternational debt denominated in U.S. dollars, largely because\nof the loans made to the European Allies during World War\nOne. U.S. agriculture also benefitted from the war raging in\nEurope. Armies needed calories, but the sons of farmers (and\ntheir horses) in the wheat fields of France and elsewhere were\nbeing drafted into the conflict. Soon grain from the Great Plains\nof the United States was feeding British and French troops on\nthe Western Front, bringing wealth to Midwestern agricultural\ncommunities. Farmers were soon purchasing new equipment\nand buying or renting additional land to produce more. Modern World History 303\nAnti-war protesters at the US Capitol in April 1917.\nDespite Wall Street bankers\u2019 interest in profiting on the\nEuropean conflict, the U.S. federal government faced strong\npublic opinion against entering what Americans saw as a fight\nthey had no stake in. Scandinavians and German immigrants\n(the largest immigrant group in America) declared both their\nneutrality and their general impression that Germany\u2019s culture\nwas superior to that of its European rivals. The Irish, who had\nno love of England, were a powerful force in the Democratic\nParty, dominating the big-city political \u201cmachines\u201d in the North\nand Midwest. Business leaders and social activists like Andrew\nCarnegie, Henry Ford, and Jane Addams were pacifists. Poor\nsoutherners reminded America that \u201ca rich man\u2019s war meant\na poor man\u2019s fight\u201d. Samuel Gompers, head of the American\nFederation of Labor, denounced the war in 1914 as \u201cunnatural,\nunjustified, and unholy.\u201d And socialist pamphlets argued that \u201ca\nbayonet was a weapon with a worker at each end.\u201d Woodrow\nWilson ran for re-election in 1916 on the slogan, \u201cHe kept us out\nof war.\u201d But only a month after his second inauguration, Wilson\nasked Congress to declare war on Germany in April 1917.\nQuestions for Discussion 304 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Why did many Americans wish to stay out of the war?\n\u2022 Why did other Americans want the war to last as long as\npossible?\nThe European powers had\nbeen building up their\nmilitary capabilities for\nnearly a generation before\nthe outbreak of war, and it\nwas unclear whether the\nUnited States could mobilize\nPancho Villa and members of the Division rapidly. In late 1916, border\nof the North.\ntroubles in Mexico served as\nan important field test for\nmodern American military forces and the National Guard.\nRevolution and chaos threatened American business interests\nwhen Mexican reformer Francisco Madero challenged Porfirio\nDiaz\u2019s corrupt and unpopular conservative regime. Madero was\njailed, fled to San Antonio, and planned the Mexican\nRevolution. Although D\u00edaz was quickly overthrown and Madero\nbecame president, the Revolution unleashed forces that\ndemanded more social change, especially in land reform, that\nthe new liberal government was capable of delivering. New\nuprisings, led by Pancho Villa and Emilio Zapata, broke out in\nrural Mexico. Reactionaries assassinated President Madero in\nMexico City in early 1913, with the encouragement of the\nEuropean and U.S. ambassadors, and a military regime was\ninstalled\u2014but social upheaval and a guerrilla war continued. Modern World History 305\nIn April 1914, President\nWilson ordered Marines to\naccompany a naval escort to\nVeracruz on the eastern coast\nof Mexico. The Wilson\nadministration had officially\nwithdrawn its support of the\nnew military government and\nwatched warily as the\nrevolution devolved into\nassassinations and chaos. In\n1916, provoked by American\nsupport for his rivals, Pancho\nVilla raided Columbus, New\nPancho Villa and John Pershing posed for a\nMexico. His troops killed photo together in August, 1914, six months\nseventeen Americans and before Pershing would chase Villa through\nnorthern Mexico.\nburned down the town center.\nPresident Wilson commissioned General John \u201cBlack Jack\u201d\nPershing to capture Villa and disperse his rebels and used the\npowers of the new National Defense Act to mobilize over one\nhundred thousand National Guard soldiers from across the\ncountry as an invasion force in northern Mexico. Although\nthese troops failed to capture Villa, they gained experience in\nthe field and developed into a more professional fighting force,\nwhich would form the basis of the U.S. army when war was\ndeclared against the Central Powers a few months later.\nIn November 1916, Woodrow Wilson was re-elected President.\nthe people rallied around the slogan, \u201cHe kept us out of war.\u201d By\nthe spring of 1917, President Wilson believed a German victory\nwould drastically and dangerously alter the balance of power in\nEurope. But he had promised to keep the U. S. out of the war.\nSubmarine warfare had been a problem earlier in the conflict,\nwhen the Lusitania was sunk in 1915. In 1917, the German general\nstaff decided that a new push for victory on the Western Front\nneeded to be combined with renewal of U-boat attacks in an\neffort to starve the British and French. The Germans realized\nthat such a policy would draw the U.S. into the conflict on\nthe side of the Allies, but calculated that the military\nunpreparedness of the United States would give them time to 306 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nbreak through the trench lines in France and end the war before\nthe Americans arrived.\nIn January 1917, a document\ncalled the Zimmerman\nTelegram surfaced. When\ndecoded it was found to\ncontain a suggestion from an\nofficial of the German foreign\noffice to the German\nambassador in Mexico that if\nthe U. S. entered the war,\nMexico should be encouraged\nto invade America to regain\nthe territory taken in the\nMexican-American War.\nMany Americans doubted the\nauthenticity of the telegram,\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, 1916. especially because it was\ndelivered by British\nintelligence officers to the secretary of the U. S. Embassy in\nLondon. However, Zimmerman soon acknowledged its\nauthenticity, claiming he had only been suggesting a Mexican\ninvasion if the United States had already entered the war. The\nMexican government, for its part, announced they had never\nseriously considered the German suggestion\u2014after all, they\nwere occupied with their own revolution. With American public\nopinion finally behind him, President Wilson went to Congress\nin February, 1917 to announce that diplomatic relations with\nGermany had been severed. On April 2, Wilson returned with a\n\u201cWar Message\u201d that included the argument that \u201cThe present\nGerman submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare\nagainst mankind.\u201d Congress declared war on Germany on April\n4, 1917. Modern World History 307\nWilson\u2019s request for a\ndeclaration of war followed\njust a few days after Russia\u2019s\nwithdrawal from the conflict.\nThe third year of the war saw\na major change in German\nmilitary prospects when the\nRomanov Dynasty of Tsar\nNicholas II collapsed in\nMarch 1917. The trouble had\nbegun in late February with a\nstrike by women factory\nworkers in St. Petersburg.\n90,000 women took to the\nstreets shouting \u201cBread!\u201d,\n\u201cDown with the autocracy!\u201d,\nand \u201cStop the war!\u201d The\nfollowing day, over 150,000\nmen and women marched Russian troops in trenches, awaiting a\nGerman attack.\nand a general strike began.\nWithin a few days the army had sided with the revolutionaries\nand Nicholas II was forced to abdicate.\nLiberal reformers soon established a republic, which actually\nmade it easier for U.S. President Wilson to proclaim that the\nwar was to \u201cmake the world safe for democracy,\u201d since a major\nally was no longer ruled by an absolute monarch. However, the\ndemocratic reformers in Russia were not as well organized as\nsocialist revolutionaries led by Vladimir Lenin, who saw the end\nof tsarist rule as an opportunity to also defeat capitalism and\ncreating a \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d. The revolutionaries\nand the soldier and sailors who supported them wanted to end\nRussian participation in the war. 308 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBy the fall, the socialist\nrevolutionaries, called\nBolsheviks, established\nworkers\u2019 and soldiers\u2019\ncouncils\u2014\u201csoviets\u201d\u2014in the\nmajor cities. In November\n1917, overthrew the fledging\nrepublic to establish a\nrevolutionary socialist state\nunder the leadership of Lenin\nand the Bolsheviks, who\nbegan to call themselves the\nCommunist Party.

The treaty also called for territories claimed by the\nOttoman Empire to be handed over to Germany\u2019s ally, but\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia declared their independence\ninstead. Russia also agreed to pay 6 billion marks to compensate\nGermany for its losses.\nThe Russian revolution soon became a civil war between the\n\u201cWorkers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Red Army\u201d, formed by the Bolshevik\nleader Leon Trotsky, and the armies of the \u201cWhite Russians\u201d\nunder several leaders, dedicated to restoring the Tsarist\nmonarchy. To prevent the return of the Romanovs to power,\nthe revolutionaries had the entire family killed in July, 1918.\nThe revolutionaries also waged war on uncooperative peasants\ncalled Kulaks, whom they accused of withholding grain from\nthe Bolshevik government. Many of the Kulaks were Ukrainian,\nwhich contributed to an ongoing aggression toward the Ukraine\nby the new Soviet Union. Modern World History 309\nEven after World War One\nended, the Allies, including\nthe United States, supported\nthe White Russians against\nthe Bolsheviks, sending\nthousands of troops to\nsupport the\ncounterrevolutionaries in\nSiberia between 1918 and American, British, and Japanese Troops\n1920.

Britain censored mail sent by soldiers at\nthe front to their families, instituting standardized postcards\nthat allowed men in the trenches to choose from a menu of\nstatements but not to write anything specific about their\nexperiences. Society became completely focused on the war\neffort, and governments reorganized the economy around war\nproduction. The state also rationed food and strictly controlled\nthe media (which at the time meant the press) to silence dissent\nand present news of the war that boosted the morale and resolve\nof the population.

Debs, were\nAmerican citizens. Wilson also suggested that labor unions\u2019\nactions to defend worker rights during wartime would be\nconsidered an attack on America. The law was expanded with\nthe Sedition Act of 1918, which prohibited any forms of speech\nthat could be considered \u201cdisloyal, profane, scurrilous, or\nabusive language about the form of government of the United Modern World History 311\nStates.\u201d As the Russian Revolution was taken over by the\nBolsheviks, U.S. concern shifted from draft resistance to\nsocialism and a \u201cRed Scare\u201d gripped America. Hundreds were\narrested, deported, and jailed under the Espionage and Sedition\nActs.

Until the spring of 1917, the Allies possessed few\neffective defensive measures against German submarine attacks,\nwhich had sunk more than a thousand ships by the time the\nUnited States entered the war. The rapid addition of American\nnaval escorts to the British surface fleet and the establishment\nof a convoy system countered much of the effect of German\nsubmarines. Shipping and military losses declined rapidly, just\nas the American army arrived in Europe in large numbers.\nAlthough many of the supplies still needed to make the\ntransatlantic passage, the physical presence of the army proved\nto be a fatal blow to German plans to dominate the Western\nFront. Modern World History 313\nIn March 1918, Germany\ntried to take advantage of the\nwithdrawal of Russia and its\nnew single-front war before\nthe Americans arrived, with\nthe Kaiserschlacht (Spring\nOffensive), a series of five\nmajor attacks. By the middle\nof July 1918, each and every\nThe Kaiser inspecting a communications\none had failed to break trench on the western front, 1918.\nthrough the Western Front.\nThen, on August 8, 1918, two million men of the American\nExpeditionary Forces joined the British and French armies in a\nseries of successful counteroffensives that pushed the\ndisintegrating German lines back across France. The gamble of\nthe Spring Offensive had exhausted Germany\u2019s military, making\ndefeat inevitable. Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated at the request of\nthe German military leaders and a new democratic government\nagreed to an armistice on November 11, 1918, hoping that by\nembracing Wilson\u2019s call for democracy, Germany would be\ntreated more fairly in the peace talks. German military forces\nwithdrew from France and Belgium and returned to a Germany\nteetering on the brink of chaos. November 11 is still\ncommemorated by the Allies as Armistice Day (called Veterans\u2019\nDay in the United States).\nIn all between 16 and 19 million soldiers died in World War\nI along with 7 to 8 million civilians (before the influenza\npandemic of 1919). Some of the worst battles were:\n\u2022 VVeerrdduunn:: 997766,,000000 ccaassuuaallttiieess ((FFeebb..--DDeecc.. 11991166))\n\u2022 BBrruussiilloovv OOffffeennssiivvee:: NNeeaarrllyy 22,,000000,,000000 ccaassuuaallttiieess ((JJuunnee--SSeepptt..\n11991166))\n\u2022 SSoommmmee:: 11,,221199,,220011 ccaassuuaallttiieess ((JJuullyy--NNoovv.. 11991166))\n\u2022 PPaasssscchheennddaaeellee:: 884488,,661144 ccaassuuaallttiieess ((JJuullyy--NNoovv.. 11991177))\n\u2022 SSpprriinngg OOffffeennssiivvee:: 11,,553399,,771155 ccaassuuaallttiieess ((MMaarrcchh 11991188))\n\u2022 110000 DDaayyss OOffffeennssiivvee:: 11,,885555,,336699 ccaassuuaallttiieess ((AAuugg..--NNoovv.. 11991188))\nCivilian populations were also targeted. While bombing cities 314 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nfrom airplanes was much more common in World War II, naval\nblockades were also an effective way of putting pressure on\ncivilians. Even if a nation was relatively self-sufficient in food\nproduction under normal circumstances, war was not a normal\ncircumstance. The British blockade of Germany prevented not\nonly war supplies but food from reaching the German people,\nresulting in a half million civilian deaths. For the Europeans,\nWorld War One was a \u201cTotal War\u201d involving every level of\nsociety.\nBy the end of the war, more than 4.7 million American men\nhad served in all branches of the military. The United States lost\nover one hundred thousand men, fifty-three thousand dying\nin battle and even more from disease. Their terrible sacrifice,\nhowever, paled before the European death toll. After four years\nof stalemate and brutal trench warfare, France had suffered\nalmost a million and a half military dead and Germany even\nmore. Both nations lost about 4 percent of their populations to\nthe war. And death was not nearly done.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What effects do you think the trenches and poison gas\nattacks had on European soldiers and civilians?\n\u2022 Why did Germany throw so much into the Spring Offensive? Modern World History 315\nSoldiers from Fort Riley, Kansas, ill with \u201cSpanish flu\u201d at an emergency hospital ward at\nCamp Funston in 1918.\nEven as war raged on the Western Front, an even deadlier threat\nloomed. In the spring of 1918, a new strain (H1N1) of the\ninfluenza virus appeared in the farm country of Kansas and hit\nnearby Camp Funston, one of the largest army training camps\nin the nation. The virus spread like wildfire. Between March\nand May 1918, fourteen of the largest American military training\ncamps reported outbreaks of influenza. Some of the infected\nsoldiers carried the virus on troop transports to France. By\nSeptember 1918, influenza had spread to all training camps in\nthe United States. 316 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe second wave of the virus was even deadlier than the first.\nUnlike most flu viruses, the H1N1 strain struck down those in the\nprime of their lives rather than old people and young children.\nA disproportionate number of influenza victims were between\nages eighteen and thirty-five. In Europe, influenza hit\ntroops and civilians on both sides of the Western Front. The\ndisease was misnamed \u201cSpanish Influenza,\u201d due to accounts of\nthe disease that first appeared in the uncensored newspapers of\nneutral Spain while the warring nations tried to suppress the\nnews of disease for propaganda purposes.\nThe \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d infected about 500 million people\nworldwide and resulted in the deaths of between fifty and a\nhundred million people; possibly more. World population in\n1918 was about 1.8 billion; influenza infected nearly a third and\nkilled between 5% and 10%. Reports from the surgeon general\nof the army revealed that while 227,000 American soldiers had\nbeen hospitalized from wounds received in battle, almost half a\nmillion suffered from influenza. The worst part of the wartime\nepidemic struck during the height of the Meuse-Argonne\nOffensive in the fall of 1918 and weakened the combat\ncapabilities of both the American and German armies. During\nthe war, more soldiers died from influenza than combat. But the Modern World History 317\npandemic continued to spread after the armistice, with a death\ntoll of nearly 20% of those infected, as opposed to about 0.1% in\nregular flu epidemics. Four waves of worldwide infection spread\nbefore cases and deaths finally began fading in the early 1920s.\nNo cure was ever found.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Compare the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d with the current COVID-19\npandemic. What can we learn from the past?\nOn December 4, 1918,\nPresident Wilson became the\nfirst American president to\ntravel overseas while in office.\nWilson went to Europe to end\n\u201cthe war to end wars\u201d, and he\nintended to shape the peace.\nThe war brought an abrupt\nend to four great European\nimperial powers. The\nGerman, Russian, Austrian-\nHungarian, and Ottoman\nEmpires each evaporated and\nthe map of Europe was\nredrawn to accommodate\nnew independent nations. As Woodrow Wilson traveling from Versailles\nPeace Conference, 1919.\npart of the armistice, Allied\nforces occupied territories in\nthe Rhineland separating Germany and France, to prevent\nconflicts there from reigniting war. A new German government\ndisarmed while Wilson and other Allied leaders gathered in\nFrance at Versailles to dictate the terms of a settlement to the\nwar. After months of deliberation, the Treaty of Versailles\nofficially ended the war.\nIn January 1918, before American troops had even arrived in 318 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nEurope, President Wilson had offered an ambitious statement\nof war aims and peace terms known as the Fourteen Points\nto a joint session of Congress. The plan not only addressed\nterritorial issues but offered principles on which Wilson\nbelieved a long-term peace could be built. The president called\nfor reductions in armaments, freedom of the seas, adjustment\nof colonial claims, and the abolition of the types of secret\ntreaties that had led to the war. Some members of the\ninternational community welcomed Wilson\u2019s idealism, but in\nJanuary 1918, Germany still anticipated a favorable verdict on\nthe battlefield and did not seriously consider accepting the\nterms of the Fourteen Points. Even the Allies were dismissive.\nFrench prime minister Georges Clemenceau remarked, \u201cThe\ngood Lord only had ten [commandments].\u201d\nPresident Wilson continued to promote his vision of the\npostwar world. The United States entered the fray, Wilson\nproclaimed, \u201cto make the world safe for democracy.\u201d At the\ncenter of the plan was a new international organization, the\nLeague of Nations. It would be charged with keeping a\nworldwide peace, \u201caffording mutual guarantees of political\nindependence and territorial integrity to great and small states\nalike.\u201d This promise of collective security, that an attack on one\nsovereign member would be viewed as an attack on all, was a key\ncomponent of the Fourteen Points. Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points\nspeech was translated into many languages, and was even sent\nto Germany to encourage negotiation. Modern World History 319\nBut while President Wilson was celebrated in Europe as a\n\u201cGod of Peace,\u201d many of his fellow statesmen were less\nenthusiastic about his plans for postwar Europe. Former U.S.\npresident Theodore Roosevelt called the Fourteen Points \u201chigh-\nsounding and meaningless\u201d and said they could be interpreted\nto mean \u201canything or nothing.\u201d And America\u2019s closest allies had\nlittle interest in the League of Nations. Allied leaders focused\ninstead on guaranteeing the future safety of their own nations.\nUnlike the United States, safe across the Atlantic, the Allies had\nendured the horrors of the war firsthand. They refused to\nsacrifice further. Negotiations made it clear that British prime\nminister David Lloyd-George was more interested in preserving\nBritain\u2019s imperial domain, while French prime minister\nClemenceau wanted severe financial reparations and limits on\nGermany\u2019s future ability to wage war. The fight for a League\nof Nations was therefore largely on the shoulders of President\nWilson. 320 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nDespite the Allies\u2019 lack of\nagreement with the Fourteen\nPoints, the key role of U.S.\ntroops and U.S. dollars in the\noutcome gave the Americans\nan influential seat at the\nnegotiating table at Versailles.\nWoodrow Wilson was seen as\nan international hero, and his\nappointee Thomas Lamont\nbecame a central figure in the\nnegotiations that ended the\nwar and set guidelines for\nGerman reparations that\nultimately bankrupted the\nThomas W. Lamont, partner at J.P. Morgan nation and led to World War\nand Company and peace negotiator at II. Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points\nVersailles.\nhave received more attention\nfrom historians, but Britain and France were successful getting\nthe punitive items they wanted into the final treaty. Lamont\nwent along because shifting the financial burden to Germany\nguaranteed that the Allied nations that owed J.P. Morgan and\nCompany so much money would be able to pay it back.\nBy June 1920, the final version of the treaty was signed and\nPresident Wilson was able to return home. The treaty was a\ncompromise that included demands for German reparations,\nprovisions for the League of Nations, and the promise of\ncollective security. Wilson did not get everything he wanted,\nbut Lamont did. According to historian Ferdinand Lundberg,\nthe \u201ctotal wartime expenditure of the United States government\nfrom April 6, 1917, to October 31, 1919, when the last contingent\nof troops returned from Europe, was $35,413,000,000. Net\ncorporation profits for the period January 1, 1916, to July, 1921,\nwhen wartime industrial activity was finally liquidated, were\n$38,000,000,000.\u201d In the years after the war, J.P. Morgan and\nCompany would earn additional millions loaning Germany the\nmoney the treaty required it to pay to the allies so they could\npay the bankers. Modern World History 321\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Do you see any difficulty with the idea that Woodrow Wilson\nis typically seen by historians as an idealist, but his chief\nnegotiator at Versailles was Thomas Lamont?\n\u2022 Were Europeans right or wrong to put their national\nconcerns first?\n\u2022 In your opinion, what was the point of the League of Nations?\nAs Wilson had imagined it, who did it benefit?\n\u2022 Was the United States right or wrong to stay out of the\nLeague?\nThe Great War transformed the world. The Middle East,\nespecially, was drastically changed. Before the war, the region\neast of the Mediterranean had three main centers of power: the\nOttoman Empire, British-controlled Egypt, and Iran. President\nWilson\u2019s call for self-determination in the Fourteen Points\nappealed to many under Ottoman rule, especially the Arabs.\nIn the aftermath of the war, Wilson sent a commission to\ndetermine the conditions and aspirations of the people. The\nKing-Crane Commission found that most favored an\nindependent state free of European control. However, the\npeople\u2019s wishes were largely ignored and the lands of the former\nOttoman Empire were divided into several nations created by\nGreat Britain and France with little regard to ethnic\nrealities. The British in particular wanted to continue to control\nthe Suez Canal which was their route to India, and to\nmonopolize the oil of the Persian Gulf to fuel the diesel engines\nof their navy and merchant marine. 322 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMap of Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement showing areas of control and influence agreed between\nthe British and the French. Signed by Mark Sykes and Fran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot, 8 May\n1916.\nThe Arab provinces of the Ottomans were to be ruled by Britain\nand France as \u201cmandates\u201d and a new nation of Turkey emerged\nin the former Ottoman heartland in Anatolia. According to the\nLeague of Nations, mandates were necessary in regions that\n\u201cwere inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves\nunder the strenuous conditions of the modern world.\u201d Though\nsupposedly established for the benefit of the Middle Eastern\npeople, the mandate system was essentially a reimagined form\nof nineteenth-century imperialism. France received Syria;\nBritain took control of Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan (Jordan).\nThe United States was asked to become a mandate power but\ndeclined. Modern World History 323\nTo consolidate their power\nover the Arabs, the British\nsupported Hussein Ibn Ali\n(related distantly to the\nProphet Muhammad) as king\nof Hejaz on the Arabian\nPeninsula, including the holy\nsites of Mecca and Medina, in\n1916. His sons Abdullah and\nFaisal were chosen to be kings\nof Transjordan and of Syria,\nwhere Faisal was rejected and\nso instead became the king of\nIraq. The Iraqi dynasty ended\nin violence with the murder\nof Faisal\u2019s grandson in 1958,\nbut Abdullah\u2019s dynasty still\nIbn Saud (right) and Iraqi King Faisal (left) in\nrules Jordan, under Abdullah\n1931.\nII and Queen Rania. In Hejaz,\nHussein Ibn Ali was overthrown in 1925 by Ibn Saud, a tribal\nleader from eastern Arabia. Through strategic marriages with\nother tribes, Ibn Saud established Saudi Arabia. He had so many\nchildren that the current king is still one of his many sons.\nThe disposition of the Middle East was complicated by the\nincreasing importance of its oil resources. Oil had been\ndiscovered in Iran in 1908, and during the period when\npetroleum was becoming the most important commodity of the\ntwentieth century it was also becoming clear that some of the\nworld\u2019s largest reserves were located in the Middle East. The\nAnglo-Persian Oil Company (now known as BP) was established\nin 1908 to control production in Iran. After the war, British-\ncontrolled businesses that had been licensed by the Ottomans to\ndevelop oil discovered in Mesopotamia spurred British interest\nin creating the new Kingdom of Iraq under British mandate\nin 1920. The British-controlled multinational, TPC (Turkish\nPetroleum Company, established in 1912), received a 75-year\nconcession to develop Iraq\u2019s oil.\nHowever, in 1933 when enormous deposits of oil were\ndiscovered in eastern Arabia, Ibn Saud turned to the Americans 324 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nrather than the British to exploit these oil deposits, fearing\nrenewed British meddling in his country. U.S. oil companies\nhave been there ever since.\nThe movement to establish\na Jewish\nHomeland\u2014Zionism\u2014was\nbegun in the 1890s by Jewish\nAustrian journalist Theodor\nHerzl. Shocked by how Jews\nwere being persecuted\nthroughout Europe, even in\nliberal France, Herzl\nconcluded that Jews would\nnever be fully accepted as\ncitizens anywhere and that\nthey needed to establish a\nseparate Jewish\nhomeland. After some\nTheodor Herzl on board a vessel reaching\ndebate, his movement\nthe shores of Palestine, 1898,\ndecided to begin buying land\nin Palestine, the site of the ancient Hebrew kingdom. Originally,\nmost Jews around the world, especially more religious Jews,\nrejected the movement because they believed that Jews were not\nto return to Israel until the Messiah came. Zionists in Palestine\noften had problems with their Arab neighbors, who looked\nupon these new arrivals as Europeans trying to take over their\ncountry.\nIn the heat of the war, in 1917, the British Foreign Secretary\nLord Balfour promised that Palestine would be recognized as\na \u201cJewish homeland,\u201d in an attempt to gain support of Jews\namong the belligerents\u2014not realizing that Zionism was hardly\nthe majority view at that time within Judaism. Of course, the\nBritish also promised to respect Arab sovereignty in Palestine;\nsetting the stage for conflict in the region that has continued to\ntoday.\nQuestion for Discussion Modern World History 325\n\u2022 How did the negotiations between European powers set the\nscene for the conflicts of the following century?\nThe charred corpse of Will Brown, victim of Omaha, Nebraska lynching, September\n1919.\nAt home, the United States grappled with harsh postwar\nrealities. Racial tensions exploded in the \u201cRed Summer\u201d of 1919\nwhen violence broke out in at least twenty-five American cities,\nincluding Chicago and Washington, D.C. Industrial war\nproduction and massive wartime service had created vast labor\nshortages, and thousands of black southerners had traveled to\nthe North and Midwest to work in factories. But the Great\nMigration of Black people escaping the traps of southern\npoverty and Jim Crow sparked new racial conflict when white\nnortherners and returning veterans fought to reclaim the jobs\nand the neighborhoods they believed were theirs alone.\nMany Black Americans who had fled white supremacy in the 326 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSouth or had traveled halfway around the world to fight for\nthe United States would not so easily accept postwar racism.\nThe overseas experience of Black Americans and their return\ntriggered a dramatic change in their home communities. W.E.B.\nDu Bois, a black scholar and author who had encouraged blacks\nto enlist, highlighted African American soldiers\u2019 combat\nexperience when he wrote of returning troops, \u201cWe return. We\nreturn from fighting. We return fighting. Make way for\nDemocracy!\u201d But white Americans just wanted a return to the\nstatus quo, a world that did not include social, political, or\neconomic equality for black people. And they were alarmed\nand frightened by the thought of fearless, capable black men\nwho had learned to handle weapons and defend themselves on\nforeign battlefields.\nFamily leaving damaged home after 1919 Chicago race riot.\nIn 1919, racist riots erupted across the country from April until\nOctober. The bloodshed included thousands of injuries,\nhundreds of deaths, and vast destruction of private and public\nproperty across the nation. The weeklong Chicago Riot, from\nJuly 27 to August 3, 1919, considered the summer\u2019s worst,\nincluded mob violence, murder, and arson. Race riots had\nrocked the nation before, but the Red Summer was something\nnew. Recently empowered black Americans actively defended\ntheir families and homes from hostile white rioters, often with Modern World History 327\nmilitant force. This behavior galvanized many in black\ncommunities, but it also shocked white Americans who\ninterpreted black self-defense as a prelude to total revolution.\nIn the riots\u2019 aftermath, James Weldon Johnson wrote, \u201cCan\u2019t\nthey understand that the more Negroes they outrage, the more\ndetermined the whole race becomes to secure the full rights\nand privileges of freemen?\u201d In the fall, an organization called\nthe African Blood Brotherhood formed in northern cities as\na permanent \u201carmed resistance\u201d movement. The socialist\norientation of its members rapidly led to an affiliation with the\nCommunist Party of America. But the Russian-led Communist\nInternational (Comintern) had no interest in semi-independent\ngroups like the ABB with their Afro-Marxist ideas. The\nBrotherhood\u2019s members found their way to other organizations\nlike the Workers Party of America and the American Negro\nLabor Congress.\nThe wave of widespread lynching and riots against African-\nAmericans lasted into the early 1920s. One of the most\nprosperous Black communities in the United States, the\nGreenwood neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was burned to\nthe ground and over a hundred people were killed by a white\nsupremacist attack that included aerial bombing in June 1921.\nMany white Americans felt threatened by African-American\nsuccess and increased social mobility. The early 1920s also saw\na resurgence of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, which now\nadded immigrant Jews and Catholics to the list of those who\nwould destroy \u201ctraditional\u201d white Protestant America. These\nideas culminated in the Immigration Act of 1924, which lowered\noverall immigration to a small fraction of what it was before\nWorld War One, while setting up a quota system based on the\nethnic makeup in the U.S. in 1890, a time before many Jewish\nand Catholic immigrants arrived from southern and eastern\nEurope. 328 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPanorama of the Greenwood neighborhood after the riot, 1921.\nThe desire to rid the United States of what the majority\nperceived as evil is also seen in the 18th Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution, which prohibited the production and sale\nof alcoholic beverages in the U.S. Liquor had ruined many\nAmerican families, and women in particular had suffered as\nabused spouses. The Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union\nand similar prohibitionist organizations were prominent in the\nProgressive movement, pushing for a federal graduated income\ntax to replace the lucrative tax on liquor. The war made\nprohibition even more patriotic, since the beer industry was\ndominated by immigrant Germans, and the amendment was\nratified shortly after the end of the war.\nThe success of the Russian\nRevolution and the\nCommunist victory in the\nRussian Civil War enflamed\nAmerican fears of\ncommunism. The executions\nof Nicola Sacco and\nBartolomeo Vanzetti, two\nItalian-born anarchists, Postcard of a protest for Sacco and\nVanzetti in London, 1921.\nepitomized the new\nAmerican Red Scare. Arrested\non suspicion of armed robbery and murder, their trial focused\nnot on the defendants\u2019 guilt or innocence, but on their anarchist\npolitical affiliations. Sacco and Vanzetti were quickly convicted\nand sentenced to death, setting off a series of appeals and\nmotions for mistrial. In 1925, while the two men sat on death\nrow, another man confessed to the crime and provided details\nthat made his confession credible. The judge, however, refused\na petition for a new trial, later remarking to a Massachusetts Modern World History 329\nlawyer, \u201cDid you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards\nthe other day?\u201d\nPeople all over the world demonstrated their sympathy with\nthe accused. Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw, and H.G.\nWells signed petitions. Demonstrations were held in London,\nParis, Geneva, Amsterdam, and Tokyo. Famous authors wrote\nabout the case, such as John Dos Passos\u2019s Facing the Chair,\nMaxwell Anderson\u2019s Gods of the Lightning or Upton\nSinclair\u2019s Boston. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)\nlabor union called a three-day national walkout to protest the\nexecutions. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed just after\nmidnight on August 23, 1927. The Sacco-Vanzetti case\ndemonstrated an American paranoia about immigrants and the\npotential spread of radical ideas, especially those related to\ninternational communism.

Intellectuals had\nshared in the celebration\nwhen war had been declared,\nparading in the streets of\nmany national capitals. It is\nunclear exactly what they\nwere expecting from the war,\nbut their experience was quite\ndifferent. No one exposed to\nthe misery of trench warfare\ncould hang onto illusions of\nthe heroism and nobility of\nthe struggle they were\nengaged in. The cold, the\nErnest Hemingway in uniform in Milan, mud, and the terror of\n1918. He drove ambulances for two pointless charges over the top\nmonths until he was wounded.\nordered by commanders who\nhad no clue what they were doing and who rarely led their men\n333 334 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ninto the slaughter \u2013 all these factors were captured by journalists\nand then by novelists like the American Ernest Hemingway (A\nFarewell to Arms, 1929), the German Erich Maria Remarque (All\nQuiet on the Western Front, 1929), and the British Ford Madox\nFord (The Good Soldier, 1915, and Parades End, 1925) and Robert\nGraves (Goodbye to All That, 1929). The absurdity of Western\nculture was on display in what has come to be known as the\nmodern crisis. The trenches had also been an unusual\nopportunity for the classes to mix. Some upper-class British\nofficers such as Ford developed a new understanding of people\nthey probably would never have met in their normal lives at\nhome. Other novels dealing with these themes include German\nauthor Thomas Mann\u2019s Magic Mountain (1924), Rebecca West\u2019s\nThe Return of the Soldier (published in England as the war was\nending in 1918), and even Virginia Woolf\u2019s most famous book,\nMrs. Dalloway, where one of the main characters, Septimus\nSmith, is a war veteran suffering hallucinations caused by what\nwe might now call Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD)\u2014what was then called \u201cshell-shock.\u201d Smith avoids being\ncommitted to a mental institution by jumping out a window to\nhis death.\nDmitry Mendeleev\u2019s \u201cNatural system of the elements\u201d, 1870\nAlongside the novelists and intellectuals questioning the value\nof culture and social traditions that had led to the disastrous\nwar, scientists were beginning to question the assumptions that\nformed the basis of our understanding of the universe. Since\nNewton, science had been pretty certain of the fundamental Modern World History 335\nnature of reality. The atoms that were assumed to be the basic\nbuilding blocks were imagined to function like little billiard\nballs, obeying all the laws of motion that scientists had studied\nin the \u201cmacro\u201d world of regular experience. By the late 19th\ncentury scientists had discovered nearly 70 elements out of the\n90 or so that occur naturally on earth. Russian scientist Dmitri\nMendeleyev had explored the chemical nature of the elements\nand developed the periodic table that expresses their chemical\nrelationships. On the other end of the spectrum, at the\nastronomical scale, the universe was believed to be made up of\nan eternal field of stars that spread in all directions.\nThis idea was challenged by\nEdwin Hubble\u2019s discovery\naround 1925 that the\nAndromeda nebula, a fuzzy\npatch on the star maps, and\nother \u201cspiral nebulae\u201d were\nactually distant galaxies and\nthat all the visible stars were\njust nearby members of our Photograph of the \u201cGreat Andromeda\nNebula\u201d, 1899.\nown, Milky Way galaxy.\nHubble discovered more\ngalaxies, and then used measurements of their Doppler shifts in\nlight wavelengths to deduce that the universe was not steady and\neternal, but expanding. Albert Einstein\u2019s theories of special and\ngeneral relativity suggested there were no static cosmological\nsolutions, which led to the formulation of the Big Bang Theory\n(originally called the hypothesis of the primeval atom) by\nBelgian Catholic priest Georges Lemaitre.\nAtoms had been thought of as tiny billiard balls, obeying the\nbasic laws of motion suggested by classical physics. Einstein\nchallenged these ideas with his work on electromagnetics, and\nthen Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Louis De Broglie, and\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger smashed the classical model entirely with\ntheir development of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle alerted the public that things were not\nwhat they appeared\u2014that it was impossible to measure the\nposition and velocity of a particle at the same time, and that the 336 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nact of observation changes the process being observed. Others\npicked up on this idea, which became a metaphor for the\nintrusion of explorers and experimenters into the things they\nwere exploring.\nScientists at the 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels included Marie Curie, Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg, Louis de Broglie, Niels Bohr, Max\nPlank, and Albert Einstein.\nEven sociologists and anthropologists were influenced by the\nuncertainty principle, and began wondering how their arrival\nin people\u2019s lives to gather data about their cultures actually\naltered those cultures. Psychologists Sigmund Freud and Carl\nJung complicated matters even more when they suggested that\nthere was a whole lot going on in the human subconscious\nover which we do not have control or even direct knowledge.\nThe solid, rational basis of the western world was beginning to\nlook like a house of cards or a shared hallucination that might\nevaporate at any moment. Modern World History 337\nThe destruction of World\nWar One, and the new ideas\nin science, sociology, and\npsychology led artists,\narchitects, and filmmakers to\nreconsider \u201creality\u201d as well.\nAlready in the 19th century,\nthe challenge and promise of\nindustrialization, liberalism\nand nationalism had changed\nthe themes traditionally\nconsidered by artists, while\nthe attempt to get at the\nessence of a scene inspired\npainters to record their first\nEdvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d\n\u201cimpression\u201d of a scene,\nhighlighting color and light over form. Even before World War\nOne, the experimentation of the mainly French impressionists\nand post-impressionists (like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste\nRenoir, Vincent Van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin) inspired artists\nlike the Norwegian Edvard Munch towards\nexpressionism\u2014using the impressionist style to express interior\nemotions. Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d from 1893 perhaps best sums\nup the \u201cshock of the new\u201d experienced not just by the artists but\nby much of society in the new industrializing world.\nAbstract expressionism\nafter the war reverted to\nforms and shapes to reveal\ninterior thoughts and\nfeelings, such as in Wassily\nKandinsky\u2019s \u201cYellow-Red-\nBlue\u201d and Paul Klee\u2019s \u201cAncient\nSound\u201d, both painted in 1925.\nYellow-Red-Blue, Wassily Kandinsky, 1925 The surrealist and Dadaist\nmovements of the 1920s\nespecially pointed to the absurdity of societal conventions,\nexploded in the carnage of World War One. The surrealists also 338 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nfocused on imagery inspired by Freud\u2019s theories about dreams,\nsuch as Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s \u201cThe Menaced Assassin\u201d from 1927.\nFilm-making had\nprogressed quickly from\nsimple experimental images\nin the late 1890s to more\ncomplex stories in the years\nleading up to the war, with\ndirectors like Charlie Chaplin\nand D.W. Griffith taking the\ncamera out of the theatre and\nintroducing camera angles,\nclose-ups, and moving\ncarriages following the action,\nwith editing to combine\nscenes into longer narratives.\nAfter the war, German\nexpressionists produced the\nhorror film The Cabinet of Dr.\nCaligari (1920), using abstract\nsets to tell a story to criticize\nthe insane authoritarianism\nthey believed had directed\nsociety during the recent\nconflict. Other German\ndirectors like F.W. Murnau\n(Nosferatu, 1922 and Sunrise,\n1927) and Fritz Lang\nPoster for the 1927 German film\n(Metropolis, 1927 and M, 1931) Metropolis depicting the\nalso explored challenging Maschinenmensch (Machine-person) in\nfront of a dystopian city of the future.\nthemes in their films, while\nthe Russian Sergei Eisenstein used metaphoric images and\ncamera angles to tell stories of the workers\u2019 struggle in The\nBattleship Potemkin and Strike (both released in 1925). Modern World History 339\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were artists and authors thrown into a \u201cmodern crisis\u201d\nafter the Great War?\n\u2022 How did science contribute to undercutting the sense of self-\nsatisfaction felt by people before the \u201ccrisis\u201d?\nHyperinflation\nPeace began in Europe with the hope that the new nation-\nstates that replaced the German, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian\nEmpires in Central Europe would deliver social justice and\nprosperity through new democratic constitutions. Not\neverybody was willing to wait patiently for life to get better after\nthe war and pandemic, however. And the new Soviet Union,\nwhich had survived attempts by the allies and the U.S. to defeat\nthe Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, felt justified in\ntrying to export their \u201cworkers revolution\u201d to the rest of Europe.\nAttempts at violent communist-inspired revolution led to\nviolent reactions. Revolutionaries found support among the\nworkers of many nations. Many believed the bloodbath in the\ntrenches had to have meant something more than just gaining\nthe right to vote\u2014perhaps it was to birth a new socialist utopia,\nreplacing the not just the monarchs who started the war, but the\ncapitalists who profited from it. 340 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nIn Germany, liberals and\nsocial democrats had\ndeclared a republic when\nKaiser Wilhelm abdicated in\nthe final days of World War\nOne, with the hope that they\ncould negotiate a peace as\nequals with the\ndemocratically-elected\nSpartacist rebels holding a street in Berlin,\ngovernments of Great Britain,\n1919.\nFrance, and the United States.\nHowever, just weeks later, Bolshevik-inspired revolutionary\nactions like the Spartacist Revolt in Berlin were brutally\nsuppressed by the new German government with the help of the\nparamilitary Freikorps\u2014troops returning from the front who,\nhaving just fought for their nation, did not want Germany taken\nover by a \u201cforeign\u201d socialist revolution.\nAlthough the new government was not treated as an equal by\nthe Allies at Versailles, delegates elected from all over Germany\nmet at Weimar, the cultural capital of Germany, at the same\ntime to write the most representative constitution in the world,\nwhich was adopted in August 1919. The Weimar Republic\nincluded an elected president and parliament, the Reichstag, as\nwell as a chancellor who organized a cabinet of government\nministers. Elections were based on proportional representation,\nwhich almost always results in a multi-party government. The\nspectrum of political parties included pro-Republic social\ndemocrats, liberals, and Christian democrats in the middle, with\nanti-democratic nationalists, monarchists and fascists on the\nright, and revolutionary socialists and communists on the left.\nThis wide range of political orientations was typical in most\nEuropean democracies between the world wars.\nAll the countries of Europe, both old and new, faced massive\nunemployment and inflation after the war as their economies\nreadjusted and veterans returned to the workforce. However,\nthese problems were magnified in Germany because on top\nof everything else, under the Versailles Treaty, the new\ngovernment had to pay reparations to the Allies in the form\nof gold, coal and timber. By 1923, the Germans were unable Modern World History 341\nto keep up with coal deliveries (any of the richest coal fields\nof Imperial Germany were now part of the new country of\nPoland); so French and Belgian troops moved in to occupy the\nnorthwestern Ruhr Valley, location of much of German\nindustry. The German government encouraged a widespread\nstrike to protest the occupation, which it funded funded by\nprinting more paper money. Like nearly all of the world\u2019s\ncurrencies, the German Deutschmark had originally been backed\nby gold, but the Kaiser had taken the country off the gold\nstandard at the beginning of the war. Germany had expected to\ncapture territory that would pay for its war expenses, but defeat\nand reparations changed the situation drastically. Printing more\nDeutschmarks decreased the value of each one, until ultimately\nthey were not worth the paper they were printed on.\nPiles of new Notgeld banknotes awaiting distribution at the Reichsbank during the\nhyperinflation.\nThe 1923 Weimar German inflation became a textbook case of\nhyperinflation. At the end of World War One, 170 Deutschmarks\nbought an ounce of gold; by January 1923, at the start of the\noccupation of the Ruhr, the same ounce of gold was worth\n372,477 marks. With the strike and increased printing of paper\nmoney, Germans needed nearly 270 million marks to purchase\nan ounce of gold by September, and the inflation rapidly got 342 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nworse. By the end of November, 87 trillion marks would buy an\nounce of gold. And of course, gold was not the only commodity\nthat was becoming unaffordable in terms of marks. Stories\ncirculated of people taking wheelbarrows full of Deutschmarks to\nthe marked to buy a loaf of bread.\nThe disruption to the German economy was severe. As\ntypically happens with hyperinflation, when workers received\ntheir pay they would rush to markets and immediately buy\neverything they could before the currency was worth any less.\nWorkers demanded higher wages to keep up with higher prices,\nwhich only added more worthless currency to the money\nsupply and created more inflation. The savings of middle-class\nfamilies, set aside for a house, a car, or for retirement, were\nwiped out to purchase food for a week. Adding to the financial\nchaos, previous debts were quickly paid off with the now-\nworthless marks.\nU.S. bankers, led by Charles\nG. Dawes, sat down with\nfinancial representatives of\nthe other Allied powers to\nrenegotiate German\nreparations. Dawes had\nhelped secure the $500\nmillion Anglo-French Loan\nand had then served as a\nGeneral during the war.\nAmerican financiers\nunderstood that a chaotically\nunstable German economy\nwould never be able to pay\nindemnities to the British,\nFrench, and others, which\nCharles G. Dawes\nmade it more difficult for\nthese Allies to cover their own debts to Wall Street. The solution\nDawes negotiated was to have U.S. banks lend Germany the\nmoney it needed to keep up payments to the European Allies,\nwho could then pay the Americans, who in turn could lend\nmore to Germany. The arrangement brought economic and Modern World History 343\npolitical stability to the Weimar Republic, and Dawes was\nawarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his work and became Calvin\nCoolidge\u2019s Vice President in 1925. The cycle of payments\ncontinued until the American banks were forced to stop lending\nat the beginning of the Great Depression, which we will discuss\nshortly.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why does printing excessive money affect prices?\n\u2022 Why was it important to American bankers to save the\nGerman economy?\nThe Soviet Union\nAfter its victory over the counterrevolutionary White Army, the\nCommunists began establishing their version of the workers\u2019\nstate envisioned by Marx in the new Soviet Union. A successful\nsocialist revolution in Russia inspired dedicated Marxists\naround the world, prompting general strikes and attempted\nworkers\u2019 uprisings in Europe and even in the United States.\nHowever, Lenin\u2019s tactics divided the revolutionaries from the\nreformers in the international socialist movement. Marx had\npredicted that the first step towards the socialist state was the\nestablishment of a liberal democracy and an industrial\neconomy filled with wage-workers (the proletariat). Russia had\nbarely begun moving toward democracy and had very few\nindustries when Lenin and Bolsheviks overthrew the\ngovernment. Did this mean that in more developed\ndemocracies, dedicated socialists should embrace communism\nand foment an immediate revolution? Many believed Russia\nwas an exception, and even Lenin struggled to fit events in the\nnew Soviet Union into the outline of future history that Marx\nhad provided. Part of the Communists\u2019 focus on fomenting\nrevolution in Germany was based on a belief that industrialized 344 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nnations were more natural settings for these types of advances\nin the cause of a worldwide workers\u2019 paradise.\nFurthermore, Lenin was\nless than democratic within\nhis own new nation. Russia\nbecame a one-party state\ndominated by a trained cadre\nwho would follow the orders\nof Communist Party\nleadership, rather than a\nmulti-party democracy with\nfull and open discussion of\nissues. The Bolsheviks were\nable to take over the Russian\ngovernment in 1917 because\nthey were more organized\nand aggressive than any of\ntheir political rivals. Lenin\nand the communists declared\nthemselves the true\nLenin\nrepresentatives of Marx\u2019s\nideas and argued that their\nmodel should be followed by communist parties in other\ncountries. Others who also called themselves socialists disagreed\nwith Lenin\u2019s interpretation of Marx (or even with Marx himself),\nand many were more interested in reform than in revolution.\nDebates over both doctrine and actions split the international\nmovement into revolutionary communists and reform\nsocialists, with Lenin setting up his own \u201cCommunist\nInternational\u201d (the Comintern) to oppose the older Socialist\nInternational of social democratic political parties. Until the\nmid-1930s, Soviet communists often spent more energy\nstruggling against social democrats and other parties on the left\nin an attempt to be the only force representing the working\nclass, rather than fighting right-wing reactionaries and fascists.\nMeanwhile, debates over policy and leadership in the Soviet\nUnion itself had both domestic and international consequences.\nOne important problem was how to organize the agricultural Modern World History 345\nsector. Marx had focused his analysis on an industrial society\nwhere workers would own the means of production rather than\nthe bourgeoisie\u2014so Lenin and other Soviet leaders took over\nRussia\u2019s factories and embarked on further industrializing their\ncountry. But Marx had not considered agriculture in as much\ndetail. The Red Army broke up the large landholdings of the\nold Russian nobility, distributing the land to those who worked\nit. But it was unclear to Marxists (and it became very important\nto the Communist Party to believe it was fulfilling the ideas\nand predictions of Karl Marx) whether leaving small landowners\nalone in the countryside might create a class of small property-\nowners who might form their own bourgeoisie to rival the\nproletariat. Already during the war and the civil war, distrust\nhad grown against the Kulaks, small farmers living mainly in\nthe Ukraine. Lenin had denounced them as \u201cwreckers\u201d when\nit seemed they were withholding their grain from government\ncollectors. These debates were still continuing when Lenin\nsuffered a stroke and died in 1923.\nOne of the main dangers of\na cadre party is deciding on\nchanges of leadership.\nFactions dividing the Soviet\nCommunists formed around\nLeon Trotsky, Lenin\u2019s close\nally during the revolution and\nthe successful commander of\nthe Red Army, and Joseph\nStalin, an extremely capable\norganizer who controlled\nmuch of the Party machinery.\nTrotsky argued in favor of a\n\u201cpermanent revolution,\u201d\nStalin confers with an ailing Lenin in\nconstantly perfecting the September 1922.\nworkers\u2019 state, which\nincluding eliminating private property in the countryside and\ncollectivizing the agricultural sector. Stalin insisted that Lenin\nhad already established a precedent by allowing a degree of\nmarket orientation in farming and that it seemed to be working 346 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwell. Stalin won the argument and became the new leader of\nthe Soviet Union. Trotsky went into exile, where he and his\nfollowers founded yet another Trotskyist International of like-\nminded revolutionaries. He was assassinated in 1940 in Mexico\nCity, by a Soviet agent.\nStalin, in the meantime, announced the first in a series of\nFive-Year plans to industrialize the Soviet Union even more\nrapidly. In his second plan, he embraced the forced\ncollectivization of agriculture. Stalin essentially came around to\nTrotsky\u2019s view that small land-holders would become bourgeois\nanti-revolutionaries. Stalin was becoming increasingly paranoid\nof any social sector or group of leaders that he thought\nthreatened his own authority, including his hold over the\nCommunist cadre, the Comintern, and the apparatus of the\nSoviet bureaucracy. The forced collectivization of agriculture in\nthe early 1930s led to death by starvation of nearly three million\nUkrainians. Peasants resisted the loss of their land by planting\nand harvesting fewer crops and by killing their livestock before\nthey could be seized. Many peasants were punished by the\nauthorities, who confiscated everything they had and left them\nto starve. By 1931 when Stalin announced to the world that the\nwildly successful five-year plan had been completed ahead of\nschedule, at least 3 million peasants had died. The famine is\nknown in Ukraine as Holodomor, or the Ukranian Genocide. Modern World History 347\nStarved peasants on a street in Kharkiv, in northeast Ukraine, 1933.\nAs the claims made by Stalin diverged more and more from\nreality, dissenters had to be dealt with. Stalin began sending\ncritics to Gulag concentration camps in Siberia, or simply\nhaving them executed by his secret police. In the late 1930s,\nabout 1.7 million suspected dissenters were arrested and 724,000\npeople were shot in the back of the head by Russian secret\npolice. Among these were hundreds from the Red Army officer\ncorps, who Stalin suspected were sympathetic to the ideas of\nTrotsky. Stalin had published a book about Lenin that outlined\na \u201cCorrect\u201d view of Marxist-Leninist ideology leading to himself\nand excluding Trotsky. When Leningrad party leader Sergei\nKirov was murdered in 1934, Stalin launched what became\nknown as the Great Purge. Thousands of party members,\nincluding many leaders who had worked closely with Lenin,\nwere targeted. A series of show-trials in Moscow featured\nshocking scenes of senior Party officials confessing to counter-\nrevolutionary crimes and begging for execution. Among the\npeople accused of treason and shot was Mikhail Tukhachevsky,\nRussia\u2019s most brilliant military commander who had been\nawarded the highest rank in the country, Marshall of the Soviet\nUnion. Stalin wiped out an entire generation of seasoned 348 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmilitary leaders who had helped the Bolsheviks achieve their\npower. Both the purge and the famine in Ukraine would make it\neasier for Hitler to invade the Soviet Union in 1941: the Germans\nfound willing collaborators among the Ukrainians, while they\nrapidly chased the ill-led Soviet army all the way to the gates of\nMoscow itself.\nThere is considerable\ndebate about the number of\npeople killed under Stalin\u2019s\nrule. At the time, most of the\nworld\u2019s communists either\nrefused to believe or tried to\njustify Stalin\u2019s excesses, and\nhis regime certainly did not\nadvertise its deeds. The low\nestimates are 10 to 15 million\nkilled and the high estimates\nof non-war-related deaths\nreach 60 to 65 million.

Modern World History 349\nRise of Fascism\nLike other European\ncountries, Italy was disrupted\nby labor and socialist\nagitation after World War\nOne. Strikes in the industrial\nnorth and agitation by\nlandless peasants in the\nagrarian south were\nsuppressed only with great\ndifficulty by the government, From 1925, Mussolini styled himself Il Duce\n(the leader)\na multi-party parliamentary\ndemocracy with a figurehead king. Since the 1870s, constant\nshifting of political coalitions, cabinets, and prime ministers had\nresulted in governments that were barely ready for war\u2014the\nItalians had little to show for the nearly 750,000 dead soldiers\nwho fought the Austro-Hungarians to a draw in the Alps. The\ngovernment was even less prepared for what seemed to be an\nimminent Red revolution. In October 1922, in the midst of yet\nanother general strike, the Fascist Party, led by Benito\nMussolini, marched on Rome. To prevent civil war, the King\nasked Mussolini to form a government. He would remain prime\nminister for the next twenty years.\nMussolini had begun his political career as a revolutionary\nsocialist before World War I. However, he despised the pacifism\nof Italian socialism and became a convinced nationalist. He\nserved in the war; like Germany\u2019s Adolf Hitler, reaching the rank\nof corporal. Shortly after the war\u2019s conclusion, he reentered\npolitics, trading his previous socialism for a militarist\nnationalism in a new Fascist Party. 350 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBlackshirts with Benito Mussolini during the March on Rome, 28 October 1922.\nIn addition to being anti-socialist, Fascism was anti-liberal and\nanti-democratic. Mussolini and his followers believed that\nparliaments were ineffective talk-fests of corrupt politicians that\nshould be replaced by strong authoritarian leaders. Although\nfascists in Italy and the rest of Europe participated in elections,\nthey did so with a high level of organized street violence by\ntheir own paramilitary units against political opponents,\nespecially socialists and communists. Mussolini\u2019s black-shirted\nsquadristi were imitated by the Nazi brownshirts in Germany\nand the Falangist blue-shirts in Spain, among many others in\nthe rest of Europe and the Americas. Not only did they break up\nrival political meetings, they also brutally attacked strikers and\nlabor organizers.\nBy 1925, Mussolini had outlawed all other political parties and\ndeclared himself the supreme leader: Il Duce, in Italian. He went\non to impose \u201ctotalitarianism\u201d, his word for state control over\nthe entire social and economic life of the nation. Claiming that\nthey were protecting private property against socialism, fascists\nactually created a form of state corporatism that was every bit\nas autocratic as Stalin\u2019s system but retained the appearance of\nprivate ownership. \u201cCorporations\u201d in this case means not only\nindustrial companies, but also \u201ccorporate groups\u201d of citizens\nbased on their occupations, guilds, and associations. The leaders Modern World History 351\nof these corporate groups represented their members in the\nnational government, under \u201ccoordination\u201d by the dictator. The\nestablishment of corporate groups supported the claim that a\nwide array of political parties was no longer necessary; but in\nreality, the selection of leaders was limited to members of the\nofficial state party.\nMussolini and other fascists\nwanted to impose upon their\ncountries military discipline\nand unquestioning loyalty to\nthe leader. Imperial\nexpansion became a priority\nand war was encouraged to\nbring grandeur to the nation\nand strengthen its people.\nEritrean children vow allegiance to the Fascists promoted a mythic\nNational Fascist Party in Italy\u2019s African\npast of glorious conquest to\ncolonies, 1922.\ninspire a warrior culture.\nMussolini wanted to build a large army and navy to dominate\nthe Mediterranean and to expand the Italian Empire\u2014all to\n\u201cmake Italy great again.\u201d\nFascism gained ground more slowly in most other countries\nin the 1920s, until the onset of the Great Depression. Italy did\nnot seem to suffer as acutely from the social, labor and political\nunrest that came with the unexpected international economic\ncrisis because the Italian opposition had been eliminated or\njailed years before. For property-owners and capitalists, fascism\nwas a defense against revolutionary communism, while even for\nsome in the working class, it seemed to provide a degree of\nsocial and political stability that democracy was struggling to\nretain. This impression, even if it was not entirely accurate, did\na lot to interest Italy\u2019s neighbors in a political system that \u201cmade\nthe trains run on time.\u201d\nQuestion for Discussion 352 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Why were people in Europe and America not more alarmed\nby Italian Fascism?\nThe Great Depression\nThe exact causes of the Great Depression are still being argued\nby historians and economists. An ongoing agricultural recession\nin the United States and abroad during the 1920s was an\nimportant element, as was a Wall Street stock market bubble\ncaused by excessive use of margin to buy company shares.\nInvestors were able to buy the shares of companies for pennies\non the dollar by borrowing 90% to 97% of the purchase price.\nThis allowed them to buy ten to twenty times the number of\nshares they could actually afford, with lenders putting up the\nrest. This system works very well as long as prices continue to\nrise, and the extreme demand for stocks powered by margin-\nbuying drove the prices ever higher. Insider trading was also\nquite common, with secret \u201cpools\u201d of investors buying up stocks\nto inflate prices, waiting for others to join in the game, and\nthen selling when the price reached a profitable new height.\nDuring the 1920s, the value of the stock market doubled without\na corresponding increase in corporation assets or earnings. The\nmarket grew at a rate of over 20% per year while the economy\nshrank. Most stock prices rose to levels that could not be\nexplained by their assets or earnings, since industry was\nactually starting to feel the pinch of the agricultural recession.\nStock prices typically reflect the underlying value of the\ncompany; in the bubble they mostly reflected the buying frenzy.\nWhen credit became a bit tighter and people began receiving\nmargin calls and trying to sell more of these inflated shares than\nthere were new buyers for, the bubble burst. Modern World History 353\nBlack Thursday was\nOctober 24, 1929. But it was\nonly the beginning of a series\nof economic calamities. The\nDow Jones Industrial Average\n(the most popular average of\nthe value of America\u2019s largest\nstocks) had fallen nearly 5%\nthe day before, and opened\nBlack Thursday at 305. As\nsoon as the opening bell\nrang, the market began\ndropping fast on volume\nthree times greater than\nnormal.

The\nbuilding across the street from the\nmarket, and the Dow\nExchange (at top left) is 23 Wall Street,\nrecovered a bit, ending the\nheadquarters of J.P. Morgan and Co.\nday at 299. On Friday, the\nmarket closed a bit higher, but the following Monday the\naverage dropped to 260 which triggered another round of\nheavy panic selling on Black Tuesday, when the Dow dropped\nto 230. After this weeklong crash, the market continued sliding\nfor the next three years. The Dow average finally bottomed out\nat 41. The market lost 90% of its pre-Crash value, and would not\nreach the levels it had seen in September 1929 for another 25\nyears until 1954.\nThe sudden evaporation of the market, even though the\nprices of stocks had been ridiculously inflated, resulted in a\ncollapse of lending. Loan amounts had been based on these\ninflated asset values; the values had disappeared but the debt\nremained. Companies stopped producing products and laid off\nworkers. Families lost their life savings and their jobs at the\nsame time. After foreclosing on bankrupt farmers, rural banks\nwere stuck with farms whose worth continued to drop. Rural\nbanks began to fail: they had lent the money of their depositors\nto farmers who could not pay them back. \u201cRuns\u201d on banks 354 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\neverywhere became more frequent as anxious depositors\nrushed to take out their cash. Smaller banks had also borrowed\nfrom larger banks, affecting the entire financial system. Wall\nStreet stopped lending money to Germany to pay its\nreparations to the Allies.\nWorldwide, the cost of food and industrial goods dropped\nconsiderably as businesses sought to lessen the effect of losses.\nBut unemployment was so staggering that few farmers and\nworkers had enough to pay for anything, even at rock-bottom\nprices. Governments embraced protectionist high tariffs in a\nlast-ditch effort to stimulate domestic industry; however, this\nled to a collapse of global free trade which hurt the world\neconomy even more.\nIn their desperation, people everywhere began to question\nthe effectiveness of capitalism and liberal democracy to resolve\nthe crisis\u2014indeed, many began to blame liberalism and market\ncapitalism for their sudden impoverishment. Many saw the\nSoviet Union as a new model for economic stability, especially\nbecause Stalin was claiming the success of his Five Year Plans\nand no one knew what was going on behind the scenes. There\nseemed to be no unemployment under the Communists. Some\nwho felt threatened by revolutionary communism embraced\nfascism. Although labor unrest and mass protests broke out all\nover, Mussolini seemed to be maintaining order in Italy. Also,\nfascists did not seek to end capitalism and private property\nlike the communists promised to do. Many in the middle class\nsupported new fascist-inspired governments as a better\nguarantee of their livelihoods than the liberal democracy that\nseemed to have failed them. This is essentially the story of\nhow a minor political figure, Adolf Hitler, was able to become\nChancellor of Germany in January 1933, as we will see below. Modern World History 355\nShacks that members of the Bonus Army erected on the Anacostia Flats, across the\nPotomac from the Capitol, burning after its confrontation with the army.\nIn the United States, bread lines became common, although\nRepublican President Herbert Hoover, elected in 1928, insisted\nthings weren\u2019t as bad as they appeared. Shanty-towns and tent\nvillages began appearing all over the country and were\nironically nicknamed Hoovervilles. The American Legion,\nformed in 1919 by World War I veterans, agitated for the early\npayment of military bonuses that had been awarded after the\nGreat War but could not be redeemed until 1945. A \u201cBonus\nArmy\u201d formed and marched on Washington to demonstrate,\nsetting up a Hooverville in Washington and camping on the\nlawn outside the Capitol Building. Hoover ordered his Secretary\nof War to disperse the protestors, and in July 1932 U.S. troops\narmed with tanks and machine guns attacked and burned the\nbonus camp, killing a few of their former comrades in the\nprocess. Hoover lost the 1932 election to the Democrat Franklin\nRoosevelt, who issued an executive order enrolling 25,000\nveterans in the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1936 Congress\nauthorized the early payment of $2 billion in World War I\nbonuses.\nTo make matters worse, a drought in Great Plains in the early 356 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n1930s created an agricultural disaster. The Russian Revolution\nand World War I had reduced European farm production and\nhad driven up the price of American grain in international\nmarkets. Marginal high plains grazing lands in western Kansas\nand Nebraska, Oklahoma and northwestern Texas were put\nunder the plow. Cropland in this region doubled between 1900\nand 1920, and then tripled again between 1925 and 1930. As\nEuropean agriculture recovered, grain prices began to drop, so\nU.S. farmers planted more to try and earn the same amount.\nA farmer and his two sons during a dust storm in Cimarron County, Oklahoma, April\n1936.\nPlowing fields for annual corn and wheat planting is such a\ncommon farming practice, it seemed normal to continue the\npractice as farmers expanded westward. However, on the high\nplains, perennial grasses had evolved to find water deep in the\nsoil and hold onto it. Plowing exposed the soil to the sun and Modern World History 357\nwind, and cut the roots that trapped moisture and bound the\nsoil together. The western edge of the prairie was actually a\ncompletely different ecosystem from the eastern edge by the\nGreat Lakes, but the change in climate was very gradual.\nAlthough many farmers moving west to convert the high plains\nrangeland to cultivation failed to notice it, rainfall was scarcer\nand the wind blew harder. Those who did notice were reassured\nby experts that \u201crain followed the plow.\u201d But of course, that was\njust boosterism and wishful thinking: rain did not follow the\nplow. Between 1933 and 1935, drought struck the area. Over half\na million people were left homeless when the topsoil blew away.\nIn a single storm, beginning\non November 11, 1933, topsoil\nfrom Oklahoma was blown all\nthe way to Chicago, where\nover 12 million pounds of it\nfell on the city like snow. On\nBlack Sunday, April 14, 1935,\ndust storms were reported\nA dust storm approaches Stratford, Texas,\nin 1935. from the Canadian border to\nTexas. Newspaper reporters\nthroughout the affected area wrote that they could not see five\nfeet through the blowing dust. The agricultural disaster that\nbecame known as the Dust Bowl caused an exodus from the\nhigh plains region. But the disaster was not just agricultural. Of\n116,000 refugee families surveyed on their entrance into\nCalifornia, only four out of ten were farmer families. A full third\nof the heads of families who fled Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,\nand Texas were white collar professionals. When the farms blew\naway the whole regional economy was wiped out. 358 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nIn the United States, there\nwere some who saw\ncommunism or fascism as a\nsolution. However, U.S.\ndemocracy proved stable\nenough that the voters simply\nchanged the party in power in\nthe 1932 elections, from the\nRepublicans to the\nDemocrats. Franklin D.\nRoosevelt was inaugurated\npresident a few weeks after\nHitler took power in\nGermany. Roosevelt was\nneither a communist nor a\nHerbert Hoover and Franklin D.

However, most people believed Roosevelt was \u201csaving\ncapitalism\u201d rather than \u201cimposing socialism.\u201d Many New Deal\nagencies and programs are still with us today.\nRoosevelt saw the role that Wall Street had in the crisis, and\nwanted to restore confidence in the banking system. The\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is insurance,\npaid for by banks, which guarantees that depositors will receive\ntheir savings (nowadays up to $250,000), in case of a bank\nfailure. FDIC helped bring an end to \u201cruns on banks\u201d by\nincreasing people\u2019s confidence in the banking system. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was a new agency\nthat would oversee Wall Street. New regulations put an end to\n\u201cpooling\u201d and other forms of stock manipulation and insider\ntrading, in order to restore confidence in the stock exchange.\nBorrowing money \u201con margin\u201d to invest in stocks is still closely\nregulated. Finally, the Glass-Steagall Act prevented banks from Modern World History 359\ndabbling in the securities and insurance industries\u2014its repeal\nin the 1990s is seen as one of the causes of the 2008 Financial\nCrisis.\nIn agriculture, the Roosevelt\nAdministration began paying farmers\nnot to over-plant and stabilized farm\nprices with the Agricultural\nAdjustment Act. Agricultural\nExtension programs also taught new\nfarming methods to prevent a future\nDust Bowl.\nPublic Works Administration construction of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River\nbetween Oregon and Washington.\nFederal government programs also put people back to work.\nThe Works Progress Administration (WPA) included large\nbuilding projects like the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate\nBridge, but also many smaller local projects like sidewalks, post\noffices and schools.

When you see long straight lines of 85-year-old trees\nin the United States, you\u2019re seeing the work of the CCC. The\nTennessee Valley Authority (TVA) focused on developing an\nentire region.

This opened jobs to younger workers,\nwho could then afford a government-backed mortgage through\nthe Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Roosevelt\nAdministration also encouraged labor union organizing under Modern World History 361\nthe Wagner Act. Instead of the government siding with industry\nand sending troops to put down strikes as in it had in the (recent)\npast, the Wagner Act legalized unions and strikes, and set up the\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to arbitrate between\nindustry and labor in contract disputes.

The disruption caused by the collapse of Wall\nStreet and world trade especially affected German industry.\nLoans and markets dried up, and millions of employees lost\ntheir jobs. Hyperinflation wiped out people\u2019s life savings.\nPreviously, communists and (especially) National Socialists\n(Nazis\u2014German fascists) had been fringe parties, easily ignored.\nBut as Germans became increasingly desperate, they looked\nfor easy solutions, or at least someone to blame for the crisis\nof world capitalism. Political conflicts took to the streets, with\nsocial democrats fighting communists and both groups fighting\nNazis. Government instability led to frequent elections; the\nmoderates coalesced around chancellor Heinrich Bruning, a\nconservative of the Catholic Center Party, who was positively\nHooverish in his tight-fisted social and economic policies. In\nthe 1932 elections, no party won a clear majority (which was 362 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nnot unusual), but for the first time, most German voters backed\neither the Communists or the Nazis.\nAdolf Hitler, at the window of the Reich Chancellery, greets cheering crowds on the\nevening of his inauguration as chancellor, 30 January 1933\nMeanwhile, intrigues began swirling around President Otto von\nHindenberg, who (like a king in a parliamentary monarchy)\nwas responsible for choosing a politician to take the role of\nChancellor and form a government. The octogenarian\nHindenburg took the advice of aristocratic nationalists in\nJanuary 1933 to call upon Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party,\nto form a government. The aristocrats believed Hitler could be\ncontrolled; he had other ideas. Modern World History 363\nHitler and the Nazis were\nlike the Italian Fascists in their\nanti-liberal, anti-democratic,\nhyper-nationalist ideology,\nand support of the totalitarian\nideal for ruling their nation.\nThey even had their own\nparamilitary force with\nuniforms and insignia, and a\npowerful symbol in the\nswastika. The Nazis also\nappealed to many voters\nbecause of their consistent\nopposition to the Versailles\nTreaty, which nearly all\nGermans blamed for their\neconomic distress. For the\nIn 1934, Hitler became Germany\u2019s head of\nNazis, the Versailles peace was state with the title of F\u00fchrer und\na national humiliation and Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor of the\nReich).\nthe real reason that Germans\nwere unemployed. They\nblamed the liberals and social democrats who had signed the\ntreaty for having \u201cstabbed Germany in the back.\u201d\nAs Hitler took control, new elections were called for March\n1933. During the campaign, the Reichstag building was burned\ndown by a disgruntled communist; Hitler used this incident to\narrest Communist politicians. Although once again the Nazis\nfailed to win a majority in the election, Hitler was granted near-\ndictatorial powers. He outlawed the Communist Party and then\nthe Social Democratic Party. By the end of the year, all other\nparties were outlawed or dissolved; by mid-1934, Hitler purged\nhis own party of \u201cleft-Nazis,\u201d eliminating all organized\nopposition. He was declared the leader (F\u00fchrer) of Germany.\nHindenberg\u2019s death the following year allowed Hitler to\ncombine the offices of President and Chancellor, so that the\ndemocratic Weimar constitution was a completely dead letter.\nThis was a remarkable achievement for Hitler, who until\nWorld War I had been a frustrated Austrian artist living in\nVienna, absorbing extremist German nationalist and anti- 364 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSemitic ideologies. He had joined the German army at the\nbeginning of the war; after the armistice, he was assigned by the\narmy to observe and report on the various political groups that\nwere appearing in Munich. Instead, he joined one of them, the\nNational Socialist German Workers Party, and quickly became\nan effective speaker and leader. In 1920, he adopted the ancient\nHindu swastika symbol in his design for the party\u2019s flag. After\nan attempted coup failed in Munich, Hitler was imprisoned in\n1923. While in prison, he wrote Mein Kampf (My Struggle) an\noutline of his plan for the domination of the pure German\n\u201cAryan race\u201d over Europe. Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism blended with\nhis hatred of \u201cforeign\u201d Bolshevism, and he imagined German\n\u201cAryans\u201d as Europe\u2019s defense against Jews and socialism. Nazi\nfocus on racial hatred set them apart from the Fascists in Italy,\nalthough anti-Semitic ideas were shared by other nationalists\nand fascists in Europe.\nHitler and the Nazis, like\nthe Fascists in Italy, built their\npower by appealing to\npeople\u2019s worst prejudices and\nto their feelings of\nresentment that their\nproblems were someone\nelse\u2019s fault. Jews were always a\nconvenient scapegoat. As a\ngroup, they were perceived as\nbeing more successful in\nacademia, the professions,\nand business than their\nChristian counterparts. Close\nstudy of scripture was\nrespected and encouraged,\nand these habits were quickly\napplied to careers in law,\nBenito Mussolini with Hitler on 25 October medicine and science once\n1936, when the axis between Italy and\nJews were liberated from the\nGermany was declared.\nghettos.

It was\neasy to blame Jews for the economic and social problems facing\nEurope in the 1930s, especially since they were believed by\nmany to not fully be part of the \u201cnation,\u201d but rather a separate\ninternational community that divided their loyalty away from\nthe fatherland. Incongruently, the Nazis claimed that Jews were\nbehind both Communism and the international banking and\nfinancial system that Communists wanted to destroy\u2013a Jewish\ncabal was supposedly fomenting every crisis in a complex (and\nnonsensical) conspiracy theory.\nStill, in the mid-1930s,\nHitler\u2019s popularity in\nGermany was not initially\nbased on Nazi racism.\nInstead, Germans appreciated\nthe political, social, and\neconomic stability the regime\nbrought, and the ways Hitler\nwas thumbing his nose at the\nVersailles Treaty. The Nazis\nsuppressed labor unions, but\nwork projects like building\nthe Autobahn superhighway\nput men back to work.

In early 1936, when he moved troops to the French\nborder, the Allies did not respond militarily; much to the\nsurprise of many German generals. Berlin successfully hosted\nthe Olympics in July 1936, showcasing the regime to the world\nwhile also starting the tradition of lighting an Olympic flame\nbrought from Greece by relay runners. Germans felt pride that\nHitler had \u201cmade them great again.\u201d\nGerman Jews, however, suffered under the regime. Almost\nimmediately after Hitler became chancellor, the Nazis called for\na boycott of Jewish-owned businesses and Jews were fired from\ngovernment positions. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws prohibited\nmarriage with Jews and defined Jewishness based on ancestors.\nMany Nazified German towns \u201cencouraged\u201d Jews to leave so that\nthey could put up signs declaring that they were \u201cJew-free\u201d. A\ntrickle of German Jews were able to emigrate: artists, actors, and\nfilm directors moved to Hollywood, while academics like Albert\nEinstein found positions in U.S. universities. But most of Europe\nand the world did not accept Jewish immigrants. Anti-Semitism\nwas an international problem: although it was not as violent and\ndiscriminatory as the Nazi regime, even in the United States\nJews were subjected to quotas at universities, were not allowed\nto buy houses in certain neighborhoods, were denied service at\nhotels and resorts, and were not accepted in many private clubs\nand associations.\nChina, Japan, India Modern World History 367\nIn 1911, Sun Yat-sen and his\nXinhai Revolution finally\noverthrew the empire that\nhad ruled China for over two\nthousand years, but the\nrevolutionaries were not\nstrong enough to install an\neffective government\nthroughout China.

Yuan had declared\nhimself emperor in 1915, and additional provinces had broken\naway in protest. Sun and the nationalists experienced a\nresurgence on May 4, 1919, when students revolted in Beijing\nagainst the Versailles Treaty, in which Japan received the\nGerman protectorates in Shandong province, rather than\nChina. These demonstrations marked an important\nmodernizing moment for the new Republic. Later that year,\nSun Yat-sen formed the Kuomintang (Nationalist) Party,\ninspired by the May 4th Movement. By 1921, Sun had\nreestablished the republic in Canton. Meanwhile, western-\neducated intellectuals had begun organizing the Chinese 368 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nCommunist Party (CCP) in Shanghai, supporting Sun and the\nKuomintang against the warlords.\nAs the struggle continued\nagainst the northern\nwarlords, Sun died of cancer\nin 1925, and his protege,\nGeneral Chiang Kai-shek took\nover the Kuomintang.

By 1927, the\n\u201cNorthern Expedition\u201d\nagainst the warlords was\nsuccessful, led by Chiang with\nCCP and Soviet support.\nA few months later, Sun Yat-sen (seated on right) and Chiang\nKai-shek\nhowever, a new civil war\nbegan in China. Chiang\nturned against his communist allies, who he feared were\nstrengthening their support in the cities. Chiang purged CCP-\nmembers from the Kuomintang, and beginning in the\ncommercial and financial capital in Shanghai, began rounding\nup and executing many Communist leaders, while imprisoning\nothers. In 1931, the Japanese military invaded Manchuria and\ncreated the puppet Kingdom of Manchukuo, installing the heir\nto the Qing dynasty, Pu Yi, as the monarch. The Chinese\nRepublic, in the midst of a new civil war, was not in a position to\nfight the Japanese. Modern World History 369\nWith so many communists\nimprisoned or executed, Mao\nZedong, a charismatic leader\nof peasant origin, rose to\nprominence in the Chinese\nCommunist Party by the\nearly 1930s. The Nationalist\narmies reconquered parts of\nZhou Enlai (left) and Mao Zedong (middle) China\u2019s interior under\nin Yan\u2019an in 1937, shortly after the Long\nCommunist control,\nMarch.\nsurrounding the communists\nin the Jiangxi Province in October 1934. The CCP forces broke\nout of the trap and began what became known as the Long\nMarch. In 370 days, the communists covered 5,600 miles\nincluding some of the most rugged terrain in china. Mao\nZedong gradually emerged as a leader of the CCP, along with\nRed Army leader Zhou Enlai. Zhou would become the first\nPremier of the Peoples Republic of China and Mao would\nbecome the Chairman of the CCP.\nAs seen in previous chapters, by embracing western\ntechnology and government, Japan went in the opposite\ndirection of China in the late 19th and early 20th century. By\n1910 the Japanese Empire had extended its territory to include\nthe Ryuku Islands and Taiwan, had defeated the Russians in\nthe 1905 war, and had taken control of the Korean peninsula.\nJapanese industrial goods, especially textiles, found markets in\nthe U.S. and other parts of the world. And as part of the\nvictorious Allied coalition in the Great War, the Japanese were\nawarded the Marshall Islands and Shandong peninsula from\nGermany, although their proposal to condemn racism was not\napproved by the Allied diplomats in Paris.\nJapan enjoyed a parliamentary monarchy, with political\nparties, trade unions, a parliament, and a \u201cdivine\u201d emperor. In\ninternational affairs, the civilian government joined the World\nWar I allies in an effort to decrease the militarization of the\nPacific and East Asia and agreed to maintaining a smaller navy\nin the Pacific than either the U.S. or Great Britain in the 1922\nWashington Naval Treaty. Increasingly ultra-nationalist officers\nin the army and navy were upset with the civilian government 370 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nfor negotiating the treaty. They advocated a Japan that would\ndominate East Asia, eventually replacing European rule and\ninfluence. \u201cAsia for the Asians\u201d was a motto they would use\nas they turned their attention to more regions that needed\n\u201cliberating\u201d.\nAs the reign of the new\nEmperor Hirohito began in\n1926, the nationalist\nresurgence continued in the\nmilitary, taking over Japanese\nforeign policy at the\nbeginning of the Great\nDepression. The\nprotectionism of many\ncountries in the wake of the\ninternational financial crisis\nharmed the export-\ndependent Japanese\neconomy. Ultra-nationalists\nin the military began\nSh\u014dwa Emperor (Hirohito) at his advocating an extension of\nenthronement in 1928.\nthe Japanese Empire,\nfollowing the example of the\nBritish in India. In 1931, an \u201cincident\u201d was staged by Japanese\nforces in Manchuria, giving Japan an excuse to take the region\nManchuria from China. The civilian Japanese government was\nnot in a position to reverse the conquest of Manchuria by their\nown military. Japanese diplomats ended up defending the\ntakeover at the League of Nations. Modern World History 371\nIn the following years, the\nnationalists gradually took\ncontrol of the Japanese\ngovernment, using the same\nanti-democratic, anti-\nBolshevik rhetoric as the\nEuropean fascists. In late\n1936, Japan united with\nGermany in an Anti-\nComintern Treaty in\nopposition to the Soviet\nUnion and communism.

Japanese\nimperialism seemed like an attractive proposition to some in\nEast Asia who wanted to rid themselves of European imperial\nrule.\nAs mentioned previously, the British trained and educated\nlocals in India as soldiers, police, government administrators,\nand professionals in the nineteenth century in order to run the\nEmpire, claiming they were preparing India for eventual self-\nrule. When the promised self-rule would begin became a source\nof debate and conflict between the colonizers and the colonized.\nIn 1885, British-educated Indian reformers organized the Indian\nCongress Party to protest unfair treatment of Indians by British.\nThey believed they were already administering the country and\nno longer needed British bureaucrats to tell them what to do.\nIn 1909, British reforms provided for Indian representation in\nprovincial legislatures, and as seen in the last chapter, Indian 372 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsoldiers took part in many of the British campaigns during\nthe Great War, especially in Africa and the Ottoman Empire.\nAfter the war, this service inspired increased agitation for\nindependence.\nThe politics of the Congress\nParty was greatly influenced\nby Mohandas Gandhi and his\ntactic of non-violent civil\ndisobedience. Gandhi was a\nperfect example of the\ncolonial serving the Empire:\nafter being educated as a\nlawyer in England, he had\nlived in South Africa for\ntwenty-five years, serving the\ngrowing Indian community\nthere. However, reacting to\nracial discrimination, he\nbegan to organize on behalf\nStudio photograph of Mohandas K. Gandhi,\nLondon, 1931. of non-whites. Gandhi was\nalready famous for his actions\nin South Africa when he returned to India in 1915, joined the\nCongress Party, and embraced asceticism and simplicity as a\nway of life. The following year, the mostly-Hindu Congress\nParty united with Mohammed Ali Jinnah\u2019s Muslim League in a\nsincere attempt to create a party that represented all of British\nIndia.\nPopular calls for complete independence from Britain were\naccelerated by the horrific Amritsar Massacre in 1919, in which\nthe British army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians.\nIncreasing protests against British rule had led to oppressive\nmeasures, including the prohibition of public gatherings. In\nAmritsar, a religious celebration was interpreted as a political\ndemonstration by the local British administrator, and he\nordered his troops to open fire.\nIn the 1920s, the Congress Party organized the Non-\nCooperation Movement, encouraging a boycott of British\ngoods. Indian raw cotton was exported to Great Britain, where Modern World History 373\nit was made into textiles that were sold back to the Indians.\nThe Congress Party argued that factories could easily be built in\nIndia to serve the local market. By 1930, Congress Party leader\nJawaharlal Nehru openly called for complete independence.\nThe following year, Gandhi led his famous Salt March protest\nagainst the British salt monopoly. The British controlled the\nproduction and sale of salt, so Gandhi led a massive march\nto the sea to illegally make salt from the ocean. Non-violently\ndisobeying an absurd law effectively highlighted the futility of\nBritain\u2019s position in India. 374 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nGandhi at Dandi, South Gujarat, picking salt on the beach at the end of the Salt March,\n5 April 1930. Behind him is his second son Manilal Gandhi.\nThe British Parliament responded with the Government of\nIndia Act in 1935, which established regional legislatures. Voting\nwas arranged by religious and social categories, applying a\n\u201cdivide and conquer\u201d method that the British had been using\nsince the nineteenth century. Focusing Indians on their Modern World History 375\nreligious differences would have disastrous long-term results,\ndown to today. Nevertheless, the more inclusive Congress Party\nstarted winning regional elections in 1937.\nIt is important to consider that at a time when totalitarian\nfascism and communism were on the rise in throughout much\nof the world, Gandhi and the All-India Congress Party\npresented the option of effective non-violent civil disobedience\nto achieve social goals. They were radically in favor of\nindependence, but also encouraged democracy. The asceticism\nand simplicity of Gandhi was an example to be emulated, not\na way of life imposed from above. Indian ideas and techniques\nwould become an example for other struggles by colonized\npeoples and oppressed minorities, directly influencing the\ncourse of decolonization and the struggle for civil rights by\nAfrican-Americans in the United States after World War Two.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why do you think the Long March is such an important\nelement of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s history?\n\u2022 Why did some Asians welcome Japan\u2019s expanding empire?\n\u2022 What elements of Gandhi\u2019s approach to politics do you think\nwere the most effective and memorable?\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 EH 2723P \u00a9 Ermeni Studios is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 Dmitry_Mendeleyev_Osnovy_Khimii_1869-1871_first\n_periodic_table \u00a9 Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Pic_iroberts1 \u00a9 Isaac Roberts is licensed under a Public\nDomain license 376 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u2022 Solvay_conference_1927 \u00a9 Benjamin Couprie is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 2560px-\nEdvard_Munch,_1893,_The_Scream,_oil,_tempera_a\nnd_pastel_on_cardboard,_91_x_73_cm,_National_Ga\nllery_of_Norway \u00a9 Edvard Munch is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Kandinsky_-_Jaune_Rouge_Bleu \u00a9 Wassily Kandinsky\nis licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Metropolis_(German_three-sheet_poster) \u00a9 Unkinown\nis licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 2880px-AlzadosEspartaquistas.\n\u2022 Berlin, Reichsbank, Geldauflieferungsstelle \u00a9\nBundesarchiv is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Chas_G_Dawes-H&E \u00a9 Harris & Ewing is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-71043-0003,_Wladimir_Iljitsc\nh_Lenin \u00a9 Pavel Semyonovich Zhukov is licensed\nunder a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Lenin_and_stalin_crop \u00a9 Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 GolodomorKharkiv \u00a9 Alexander Wienerberger is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn_1974crop is licensed under a\nCC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license\n\u2022 Benito_Mussolini_Roman_Salute \u00a9 Daily Galaxy is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 March_on_Rome_1922_-_Mussolini \u00a9 Illustrazione\nItaliana is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Eritrean_Balilla \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 Crowd_outside_nyse \u00a9 US Gov is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license Modern World History 377\n\u2022 Evictbonusarmy \u00a9 Signal Corps Photographer is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Farmer_walking_in_dust_storm_Cimarron_County_\nOklahoma2 \u00a9 Arthur Rothstein is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Dust-storm-Texas-1935 \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 FDR_Inauguration_1933 \u00a9 Architect of the Capitol is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 PWAPBD_restored \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 SocialSecurityposter1 \u00a9 US Gov is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Macht\u00b8bernahme Hitlers \u00a9 Bundesarchiv is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Adolf Hitler \u00a9 Bundesarchiv is licensed under a CC BY-\nSA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Hitlermusso2_edit \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Grundsteinlegung f\u00fcr Werk des KdF-Wagens \u00a9\nBundesarchiv is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Dr._Sun_in_London \u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Sun_Yat-sen_and_Chiang_Kai-shek \u00a9 Unknown is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 1937_Mao_Zhou_Qin_in_Yan\u2019an \u00a9 Unknown is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Emperor_Showa \u00a9 \u5bae\u5185\u7701(Imperial Household Agency)\nis licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Manchukuo011 \u00a9 Manchukuo State Council of\nEmperor Kang-de Puyi is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 2560px-Mahatma-Gandhi,_studio,_1931 \u00a9 Elliott & 378 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nFry is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Salt_March \u00a9 Unkown is licensed under a Public\nDomain license [9]\nWorld War II\nU.S. Marines of the Second Battalion, Twenty-Seventh Regiment, wait to move inland\non Iwo Jima, soon after going ashore on 19 February 1945.\nIn many ways World War Two was a continuation of World\nWar One, especially in Europe. Germans supported Hitler and\nthe Nazis because they promised to overcome the humiliation\nof Germany at the Versailles peace conference in 1919: being\nforced to admit \u201cwar guilt,\u201d to pay massive reparations, and\n379 380 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nto limit the size and quality of their armed forces. The Nazi\nregime promised to reverse all of it, and place a powerful new\nGerman Empire as the dominant force on the continent\u2014and\nperhaps the world.\nHowever, World War Two was also a result of the worldwide\nreaction to the Great Depression, which was seen by many as\nnot only a failure of capitalism, but also a failure of democracy.\nFascism and communism seemed to some to offer the only\nplausible reactions to the crisis\u2014remember that although\nneither the Nazi nor the Communist parties in the German\nWeimar Republic ever won a majority in a contested election,\nby 1932 most German voters opted for one or the other, and\nessentially voting against liberal democracy. Germany was not\nalone in abandoning democracy and embracing\nauthoritarianism\u2014the same happened all over Eastern and\nCentral Europe, Latin America, and, most importantly, Japan.\nThe last chapter presented how the Japanese military, taking\nthe initiative against the weak objections of Japan\u2019s elected\ngovernment, initiated the conflict that would become World\nWar Two by invading and occupying the northern Chinese\nprovince of Manchuria in 1931. Again, it is striking how similar\nthe racial beliefs in the Japanese military were to those of the\nNazis: the \u201cYamato\u201d people of Japan had a special mission to\ndominate East Asia in the same way that the \u201cAryans\u201d of\nGermany were destined to rule all of Europe. Modern World History 381\nThe Road to War in Europe\nThe belief that their\nnation\u2019s greatness lay in war\nand conquest was\nfundamental to fascist\nideology in both Italy and\nGermany. While Hitler was\nstill consolidating the Nazi\nregime and rebuilding\nGerman armed forces in\nviolation of the Versailles\nTreaty, Mussolini decided to\nact. In October 1935 Italy\ninvaded independent\nEthiopia from its colonies in\nEritrea and Somalia. The\nItalians had been defeated by Ethiopian King Haile Selassie on cover of\nthe Ethiopians in 1896; this Time magazine, November 1930\ntime was different. Using air\npower and poison gas, Mussolini\u2019s military swept through\nEthiopia. By the end of 1936, most pockets of Ethiopian\nresistance were defeated. In April 1936, Ethiopian King Haile\nSelassie went to the League of Nations to ask for help, but the\nLeague had no army to attack Mussolini\u2019s.\nEmboldened by the ineffectiveness of world opinion, the\nItalian occupation of Ethiopia was brutal. In February 1937,\nin response to an attempted assassination on the new Italian\nviceroy in the capital city, Addis Ababa, Italians went on a three-\nday killing spree to exact vengeance on the Ethiopians. At least\n20,000 were murdered, including Ethiopian intellectuals who\nhad already been imprisoned in wretched conditions. As we\u2019ll\nsee, such atrocities were typical of the racism inherent in fascist\nregimes, who thought that using such terror was the only way to\n\u201cteach a lesson\u201d to \u201cinferior\u201d conquered peoples. 382 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nReview of Soviet armored fighting vehicles used to equip the Republican People\u2019s Army\nduring the Spanish Civil War.\nAfter losing most of its Latin American colonies in the early\nnineteenth century, Spain fell into decades of civil wars. By the\ntime Spain lost the Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico to the\nUnited States in 1898, the Spanish empire was less stable and\npoorer than several of its former territories such as Argentina\nand Chile. In the early years of the new century, Spanish\nworkers were inspired by socialism and anarchism, the belief\nthat taking down all forms of repression would liberate the\nnatural socialist and communal tendencies of humanity. Many\nfound fault with the Catholic Church, which received\ngovernment funds to educate and provide welfare for the poor,\nbut was seen as ineffective and hypocritically enjoying its own\nriches by the starving, illiterate, and landless peasants and\nproletarians.\nBy 1931, even the middle class had had enough of Spain\u2019s\nbackwardness. The king abdicated\u2014another victim of the crisis\nof the Great Depression\u2014and a Spanish Republic was\nestablished. A new Spanish constitution formed a presidential-\nparliamentary government with proportional representation,\nmuch like the Weimar Republic in Germany. Agrarian reform\nand limiting the temporal power of the Catholic Church divided\nthe Spanish people and the liberals and socialists lost control of\nthe government in 1933, when conservatives won the national Modern World History 383\nelections. Rebellions by radical miners in northern Spain in\n1934 led to repression and the imprisonment of thousands,\nleading to the formation of a \u201cPopular Front\u201d government in\nFebruary 1936 after very close elections.\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin\nordered the world\u2019s\ncommunist parties to join\nanti-fascist Popular Front\nThe\ncoalitions.\nSpanish Popular\nFront\ngovernment was a\ncoalition of\nsocialist,\nanarchist, and\nworkers parties\nseeking to\npreserve and\nextend liberal\nFrancisco Franco in 1930\nreforms.\nHowever, when the new government\nrolled out agrarian reforms and began\nsuppressing the Church, street fighting\nand assassinations led to a fascist-\nsupported military coup orchestrated\nby General Francisco Franco in July,\n1936. Although the \u201cnationalists\u201d took\ncontrol of northern and western Spain,\nthe fascists were stopped in the region\naround Madrid and Barcelona by\nsocialist and anarchist workers who\nhad been armed by the Republican\ngovernment. A bloody civil war\ncommenced. 384 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nHitler and Mussolini immediately\nsent weapons, troops and air support\nto Franco, while Stalin supported the\nRepublic. The leading European\ndemocracies\u2014Great Britain and\nFrance\u2014declared neutrality while the\nUnited States chose once again to try\nto stay out of Europe\u2019s disputes.\nIndividual British, French, and\nAmerican volunteers arrived to fight\nfor the Republic, hoping to make\nSpain \u201cthe graveyard of fascism\u201d.\nHowever, even before Franco and the\nnationalists finally defeated the\nRepublic in April 1939, Stalin had\npulled Soviet advisors out of Spain and\nabandoned the Popular Front\nstrategy. Francisco Franco remained\nthe authoritarian dictator of Spain\nuntil his death in 1975.\nGuernica, by Pablo Picasso, 1937.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 385\n\u2022 What were the main causes of World War II?\n\u2022 How did racism play an early role in fascist expansionism?\n\u2022 Why did Stalin support the Spanish Popular Front?\nWhy this reaction from the\nvictors of World War One?\nBy the 1930s, and the Great\nDepression, the French,\nBritish, and Americans were\nwondering what \u201cwinning\u201d\nthe Great War had really\nmeant. The deaths of\nmillions and the wounding of\nmillions more did not seem\nworth repeating. The\nGermans, on the other hand,\nhad been humiliated by the\npeace and were now led by a\nman, and a party, that\nclaimed that they could have\nwon if they had not been\n\u201cstabbed in the back\u201d by Adolf Hitler greeting UK Prime Minister\nliberals, social democrats, and Neville Chamberlain at the beginning of the\nmeeting in September 1938, where Hitler\nJews. And unfortunately,\ndemanded annexation of Czech border\nmany fascist sympathizers in areas.\nthe democracies agreed with\nthis assessment: that corrupt politicians and capitalists, as part\nof a Jewish-led cabal, had been the only ones to benefit from\nleading their countries into a useless war. There was truth in the\nobservation that bankers and capitalists had profited from the\nwar, but there was no evidence of a conspiracy. The fact that\npublic opinion descended into fantastic conspiracy theories is a\ntestament to the psychological effect of the worldwide\neconomic crisis on a fearful humanity.\nHitler\u2019s foreign policy, which he had announced to the world 386 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nin his book Mein Kampf in 1923, was based on the idea of\nabsorbing regions with German-speaking populations into his\nGreater Reich. Lebensraum, living space, for Aryans would be\ntaken from the Slavic peoples of eastern Europe. In March\n1938, Germany annexed Austria, its ally in the previous war\nand homeland of Hitler, with the support of most Austrians\n(the Trapp family of Sound of Music fame were the exception,\nnot the rule). Once again, Great Britain and France failed to\nrespond. Hitler set his sights on the Sudetenland, an ethnically\nGerman region of Czechoslovakia. In October 1938, the British\nand French leaders, alarmed but still anxious to avoid war,\nattended a diplomatic conference in Munich where they agreed\nthat Hitler could annex the Sudetenland in return for a promise\nto stop all future German aggression. They were desperate to\nbelieve the F\u00fchrer could be appeased, but in March 1939,\nGerman troops rolled into the rest of Czechoslovakia. The\nCzechoslovak government had not even been invited to the\nconference in Munich; despite being the only democracy\nstanding in Central Europe by 1938, they were betrayed by the\nappeasement policy of their fellow democracies.\nCheering crowds greet the Nazis in Vienna a few days after the Anschluss, March, 1938.\nNor were the democracies moved by Nazi excesses against the Modern World History 387\nJews in Germany. In November 1938, after a German diplomat\nwas assassinated by an exiled German Jew in France, the Nazi\ngovernment allowed a massive outpouring of violence against\nJews and Jewish-owned businesses. German mobs murdered\ndozens of Jews, publicly humiliated thousands, and burned\nbusinesses and synagogues. The Nazi-sponsored violence\nbecame known as Kristallnacht, \u201cthe Night of Broken Glass.\u201d\nMany people in the democracies were outraged, thinking that\nsuch a pogrom was only impossible in a civilized nation like\nGermany. However, no government took action against Hitler,\nnor did any country accept Jewish refugees\u2014anti-Semitism was\nall too common in most \u201ccivilized\u201d countries.\nAll of this was happening as\nStalin was still supporting the\nSpanish Republic, hoping\nthat the democracies would\njoin in a struggle against\nrising fascism. When they\ninstead appeased Hitler,\nStalin concluded that the\ncapitalists perceived Hitler as\na bulwark against the\ncommunist Soviet Union\nrather than as a threat to their\nown territories and interests.\nThe Soviet Premier changed\nhis diplomatic strategy and\nStalin and German Foreign Minister on August 23, 1939 signed a\nRibbentrop shaking hands after the signing Non-Aggression Pact with\nof the non-aggression pact in the Kremlin.\nGermany. By that time,\nHitler had set his sights on \u201cliberating\u201d the German-speaking\npopulation in Poland and their territory. German troops poured\nacross the border on September 1, 1939. The world learned of\nthe secret agreement to divide Poland included in the Nazi-\nSoviet Pact when the Stalin sent his armies into eastern Poland\nthree weeks later. 388 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did the European democracies try to appease Hitler?\n\u2022 Was Stalin wrong to sign a non-aggression pact with\nGermany?\nThe Road to War in East Asia\nAs described in the previous chapter, the government ruling\nin the name of Japanese Emperor Hirohito also shifted toward\nfascism after the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the\nestablishment of the puppet state Manchukuo in northeast\nChina and Inner Mongolia. Manchukuo provided Japan with\nthe benefits of an imperial colony: raw materials for Japanese\nindustries that were not available on the islands of Japan and a\ncaptive market for Japanese goods. The Japanese military also\njustified their conquests by claiming they were liberating Asia\nfrom European colonialism. Not all the Asian territories they\ninvaded, however, were happy to become part of the Japanese\n\u201cGreater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.\u201d Modern World History 389\nJapanese-controlled territory after invasion, 1939.\nChina was still in the midst of a civil war between the\nKuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, and the\nKuomintang leader and President of the Republic, Chiang Kai-\nshek, ignored the Japanese threat in northern China until it was\ntoo late. Chiang appealed to the League of Nations for assistance\nagainst Japan. The United States supported the Chinese protest,\nand after a six-month investigation, the League found Japan\nguilty and demanded the return of Manchuria to China. The\ndiplomats of the League had no way to enforce their ruling, of\ncourse. Japan ignored the demand and simply withdrew from\nthe League of Nations. Japanese diplomatic isolation further\nempowered radical military leaders who could point to\nJapanese military success in Manchuria and compare it to the\ndiplomatic failures of the civilian government. The military\ntook over Japanese policy. In the military\u2019s eyes, the conquest\nof China would not only provide for Japan\u2019s industrial needs, it\nwould secure Japanese supremacy in East Asia. 390 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nJapan launched a full-scale\ninvasion of China on July 7,\n1937, and routed the forces of\nthe Chinese National\nRevolutionary Army led by\nChiang Kai-shek. The broken\nChinese army gave up Beijing\nto the Japanese on August 8,\nShanghai on November 26,\nand the Nationalist capital,\nNanjing, on December 13. In\nthe first six weeks after\ncapturing the capital,\nJapanese troops killed half of\nthe city\u2019s population of\n600,000. They began by\nA Chinese POW about to be beheaded by a\nexecuting 90,000 Chinese\nJapanese officer.\nArmy deserters who they\ndespised for surrendering, and then moved on to civilians.\nJapanese troops raped up to 100,000 women and girls and then\nshot or bayonetted most of them in what is now recognized as\none of the worst atrocities of World War II. To pacify the rest,\nthe Japanese distributed opium and heroin to the captive\npopulation. Like the Italian fascists in Ethiopia and the German\nNazis in occupied Europe, the Japanese military felt themselves\nto be superior to the conquered peoples, and believed that only\nterror could subdue the civilian population.\nHoping to halt the invading enemy, Chiang Kai-shek adopted\na scorched-earth strategy of \u201ctrading space for time.\u201d His\nNationalist government retreated inland, burning villages and\ndestroying dams; in the process killing more Chinese peasants\nthan the Japanese had killed in the atrocities in Nanjing. Chiang\nestablished a new capital deep in the interior at the Yangtze\nRiver port of Chungking. Although the Nationalists\u2019 scorched-\nearth policy hurt the Japanese military effort, it alienated\nChinese civilians and became a potent propaganda tool of the\nemerging Chinese Communist Party.

Curiously, the effort was led\nby the German businessman John Rabe, at the time a card-\ncarrying member of the Nazi Party. Eyewitness accounts\nwritten by Westerners were published in American newspapers,\nalong with photographic evidence, and the brutality of Japanese\nimperialism began to sink in. However, no one was going to\ndeclare war on Japan to save the Chinese. 392 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe United States lacked\nboth the will and the military\npower to oppose the Japanese\ninvasion, and even continued\nto sell oil and scrap iron to\nJapan. The Japanese army was\na technologically advanced\nforce consisting of 4,100,000\nmen and 900,000 Chinese\ncollaborators armed with\nmodern rifles, artillery,\narmor, and aircraft. By 1940,\nthe Japanese navy was the\nthird-largest and among the\nmost technologically Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and Eleanor\nRoosevelt on the White House lawn.\nadvanced in the world. Still,\nChinese Nationalists lobbied Washington for aid. Chiang Kai-\nshek\u2019s popular wife, U.S.-educated Soong May-ling, known to\nAmericans as Madame Chiang, led the effort. In contrast to her\ngruff husband, Madame Chiang was charming and able to use\nher knowledge of American culture and values to garner\nsupport for Chiang and his government. But although the\nUnited States denounced Japanese aggression, it took no action.\nAs the Nationalists fought for survival, the Chinese\nCommunist Party was busy accumulating supporters and\nsupplies in the northwestern Shaanxi Province. Mao Zedong\nrecognized the power of the Chinese peasant population and\nbegan recruiting from the local peasantry, capitalizing on the\noutrage caused by both the Nationalist failure to prevent\nJapanese invasion and its scorched-earth retreat. Mao gradually\nbuilt his force from a meager seven thousand survivors at the\nend of the Long March in 1935 to a robust 1.2 million members\nby the end of the World War Two.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What would you say to Japanese leaders today who claim the Modern World History 393\nRape of Nanjing never happened?\n\u2022 Do you think Chiang Kai-Shek was an effective leader of the\nKuomintang?\n1940-1942: Axis Conquests in Europe and Asia\nGerman column of panzers and mechanised infantry advancing through Ukraine, June\n1942, typifying fast-moving advances of Blitzkrieg.\nTwo days after the German Wehrmacht invaded Poland on\nSeptember 1, 1939, Britain and France declared war and began\nmobilizing their armies. The war planners hoped the Poles\nwould be able to hold out for three to four months, enough\ntime for the Allies to intervene. Poland fell in three weeks, partly\ndue to the Russian invasion in the east and partly due to a\nnew form of warfare. The German army, anxious to avoid the\nrigid, grinding war of attrition in the trenches of World War I,\nhad built its new army for speed and maneuverability. German\nstrategy emphasized the use of tanks, planes, and motorized\ninfantry to concentrate forces, smash front lines, and wreak\nhavoc behind the enemy\u2019s defenses. It was called Blitzkrieg,\n\u201clightning war.\u201d 394 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAfter conquering eastern\nPoland, Stalin\u2019s armies shifted\nfocus to occupying the Baltic\nStates, Latvia, Lithuania, and\nEstonia, and to invading\nFinland. The Soviet leader\nwas planning to reestablish\nthe borders of the former\nA group of Finnish soldiers in snowsuits Tsarist Russian Empire.\nmanning a heavy machine gun in a foxhole.\nHowever, the invasion of\nFinland met stubborn\nresistance and winter\u2014the conflict ended with the Finns losing\nonly a bit of territory on their southeastern borders.\nMeanwhile, after the fall of Poland, France and Britain braced\nfor the inevitable German attack. In April 1940, the Germans\nquickly conquered Denmark and Norway in an effort to prevent\nthe British naval blockade which had been so key to the German\ndefeat in World War One. The following month, Hitler\nlaunched his blitzkrieg into Western Europe through the\nNetherlands and Belgium to avoid well-prepared French\ndefenses along the French-German border. Poland had fallen\nin three weeks; France lasted only a few weeks more. By June,\nHitler was posing for photographs in front of the Eiffel Tower.\nIn another propaganda victory, Hitler made the French\ndiplomats sign their surrender in the same railroad car used for\nthe German surrender in the First World War.\nGermany split France in\nhalf, occupying the north and\nallowing a collaborationist\ngovernment to form in Vichy\nto govern the south and the\nFrench colonies. Led by the\n\u201cHero of Verdun,\u201d Marshal\nPhilippe Petain, the Vichy\nregime sought to reorganize Philippe P\u00e9tain meeting Hitler in October\n1940\nFrance along authoritarian\nfascist lines. Significant\nsupport for Germany by the French right was one of the reasons Modern World History 395\nfor their defeat in June 1940. Many in France had also\nabandoned democracy and welcomed the demise of the Third\nRepublic. If the future held a German-dominated Europe, they\nreasoned, then it would be better for France to collaborate as\npartners rather than as subjects in a new Nazi empire. Although\nthis rationalization fit into the scheme proposed by German\npropaganda, Hitler would never allow a full partnership with\nany of the conquered peoples.\nWith France under control, Hitler turned to Britain.\nOperation Sea Lion, the German invasion of the British Isles,\nrequired air superiority over the English Channel. From June\nuntil October 1940, the German Luftwaffe fought the Royal Air\nForce for control of the skies. Despite having fewer planes,\nBritish pilots won the so-called Battle of Britain, saving the\nislands from invasion and prompting the new prime minister,\nWinston Churchill, to declare, \u201cNever before in the field of\nhuman conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.\u201d\nFour 264 Squadron Defiants (PS-V was later shot down on 28 August 1940 over Kent by\nBf 109s.)\nBut if Britain was safe from invasion, it was not immune from\nongoing air attacks. Frustrated by losing the Battle of Britain,\nHitler began a bombing campaign against cities and civilians.\nThe Blitz, as the British came to know the nightly bombing raids 396 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\non London, killed at least 40,000 civilians. Population centers\nlike Bristol, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Southampton and\nindustrial cities like Swansea, Belfast, Birmingham, Coventry,\nGlasgow, Manchester, and Sheffield were also targeted for heavy\nbombing. The Royal Air Force defended the cities as well as they\ncould, and British industrial production which had been moved\nout of major cities was unaffected by the air attacks. The British\npeople, encouraged by Churchill, kept calm and carried on.\nIn anger, Hitler and his Vice\nChancellor Herman G\u00f6ring\nbegan a policy of hitting\nLondon every day to try to\nbreak the will of their enemy.\nBeginning on September 7\n1940, London was bombed\nevery night for 56 days,\nincluding a large daylight\nattack on September 15.\nBritish morale failed to break,\nand Germany eventually\nshifted to targeting Atlantic\nshipping and bombing port\ncities in an attempt to starve\nthe enemy. When the port of\nClydebank in Scotland was\nOriginal 1939 poster bombed in March, 1941, only\n7 of 12,000 houses escaped\ndamage. But the Germans failed to gain complete air\nsuperiority, partly due to the deployment of RADAR (Radio\nDetection and Ranging) by the British. The technology had\nbeen developed in the 1930s and was advanced and finally\nperfected by Britain in the early 1940s. It would be offered to\nthe Americans in exchange for financial and industrial support\nas the two nations strengthened ties to \u201cdefend democracy\u201d\neven before U.S. involvement in the war.\nNazi ideology considered the English as racial equals, and\nHitler hoped that Great Britain would eventually join a crusade\nagainst Bolshevism. However, Nazi doctrine focused on Modern World History 397\nestablishing German lebensraum in Eastern Europe, enslaving\nthe lesser Slavic peoples to work for the Aryans. Hitler had\nalways planned on breaking his 1939 nonaggression pact with\nStalin and invading the Soviet Union. First, German armies\ninvaded the Balkans and set up puppet regimes in Hungary and\nRomania, giving them a wider front for attacking the Soviets.\nThis action was a bit unplanned and chaotic. Mussolini, playing\ncatch-up with his Axis partner, had sent his troops to conquer\nGreece from Albania, which Italy had acquired in April 1939.\nThe Greeks not only defended themselves, but pushed the\nItalians back into Albania; Hitler had to bail out Mussolini and\ninvade, sending his armies into Yugoslavia and Greece.\nIn June 1941, German forces crossed into the Soviet Union in a\nmassive surprise attack. \u201cOperation Barbarossa\u201d was the largest\nland invasion in history. France and Poland had fallen in weeks,\nand Germany hoped to use the same Blitzkrieg tactics to break\nRussia before the winter. The German military caught the Red\nArmy and Stalin unprepared and quickly conquered enormous\nswaths of land and captured nearly three million prisoners. But\nRussia was too big. After recovering from the initial shock of the\nGerman invasion, Stalin moved his factories east of the Urals,\nout of range of the Luftwaffe. He ordered his retreating army\nto adopt a scorched earth policy, destroying food, rails, and\nshelters to slow the advancing German army. 398 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMasha Bruskina, a nurse with the Soviet resistance, before her execution by hanging.\nThe placard reads \u201cWe are the partisans who shot German troops\u201d, Minsk, October 26,\n1941\nThe German army split into three forces and reached the gates\nof Moscow and Leningrad, but their supply lines stretched\nthousands of miles.

Modern World History 399\nWhile Hitler marched across Europe, the Japanese continued\ntheir war in the Pacific. In 1939 the United States dissolved its\ntrade treaties with Japan and the following year America cut\noff supplies of war materials by embargoing oil, steel, rubber,\nand other vital goods. Instead of being starved into submission,\nJapan\u2019s resource-challenged military accelerated invasions\nacross East Asia to sustain its war effort. The Japanese took\ncontrol of French Indochina from the Vichy Regime, and began\nthreatening the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) after the\nNetherlands was occupied by Germany. Diplomatic relations\nbetween Japan and the United States collapsed. The United\nStates demanded that Japan withdraw from China and the\nFrench and Dutch territories; Japan considered the oil embargo\na de facto declaration of war.\nPhotograph taken from a Japanese plane during the torpedo attack on ships moored\non both sides of Ford Island shortly after the beginning of the Pearl Harbor attack.

On the morning of December 7, 1941,\nthe Japanese launched a surprise air attack from their carriers\non the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese\nmilitary planners hoped to destroy enough battleships and\naircraft carriers to cripple American naval power for years. The\nJapanese destroyed or seriously damaged eight battleships (four\nsank), three cruisers, three destroyers, and 180 aircraft, and\nkilled 2,403 American servicemen and wounding a thousand.\n353 Japanese bombers, fighters, and torpedo planes wiped out\nnearly the entire US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Luckily for\nthe U.S. Navy, its aircraft carriers were out on maneuvers and\nnot at port during the attack.\nAmerican isolationism fell\nat Pearl Harbor.

In\n1940 and 1941, the United States had already begun providing\nfinancial and material support to Great Britain and to Russia,\nas it had previously in World War I. Britain had stood alone 402 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmilitarily in Western Europe, but the British people refused to\nbe conquered and American supplies bolstered their resistance.\nRoosevelt and Churchill met in April 1941 and declared the\nAtlantic Charter\u2014a pledge to defend freedom and democracy\nfrom fascism.\nAfter the U.S. officially\nentered the war, Hitler\nunleashed U-boat \u201cwolf\npacks\u201d into the Atlantic Ocean\nwith orders to sink anything\ncarrying aid to Britain.

By mid-1943, Hitler\u2019s navy was losing ships faster than\nthey could be built. Soon the wolf pack was sheltering in a\ndefensive crouch in the harbors of occupied Europe.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Did Japan make a strategic error, attacking the United States?\n\u2022 Reflect on the technological developments that were\naccelerated by the war. Modern World History 403\nAllied Victories\nWhen Hitler renewed his invasion of the Soviet Union in the\nsummer of 1942, he focused on conquering the bread basket\nand oil fields of southern Russia. The Blitzkrieg again brought\nrapid success, but again got too far ahead of its supply lines.\nAlthough the strategy included sophisticated tanks, armored\ntroop carriers, and dive bombers, the Germans still used horse-\ndrawn wagons to bring up food, ammunition and spare parts\nto the advancing armies. As the advance slowed, Axis armies\narrived at the new industrial city on the Volga River, Stalingrad.\nHitler badly wanted to conquer and wipe out Stalin\u2019s namesake\ncity, and the Soviet Premier was just as determined to defend\nit. In late 1942, the two armies bled themselves to death in the\ndestroyed city; fighting house to house in a five-month battle\nthat killed nearly two million people on both sides. Stalin placed\nhis trust in General Georgy Zhukov, who planned a brilliant\nSoviet pincer move, cutting off the German 6th army in\nStalingrad. When his army was forced to surrender in February\n1943, Hitler was apoplectic in his anger and his generals began to\ndoubt that he any longer had the strategic brilliance he showed\nin the previous years.\nThe Germans planned to\nfollow up with renewed\nattacks to get at Soviet oil, but\ntheir battle with the Red\nArmy at Kursk turned the\ncourse of the war definitively\nto the Soviets. Zhukov\ncorrectly guessed the German\nstrategy, and fortified Kursk\nwhile massing armies to the\nnorth and south. After the\ngreatest tank battle in world\nhistory, Zhukov unleashed\nanother pincer move, and the\nGermans retreated from\n1944 portrait photograph of Georgy\nbattle as quickly as they Zhukov. 404 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ncould. The Red Army began rolling westward, putting the\nGermans permanently on the defensive for the remainder of\nthe war. More than any other Ally, the Soviet Union was most\nresponsible for defeating Hitler, but at great sacrifice. Twenty-\nfive million Soviet soldiers and civilians died in what Russians\ncall the Great Patriotic War, and roughly 80 percent of all\nGerman casualties during the war came on the Eastern Front.\nAllied victories in North Africa in 1942 also reversed Axis\ngains. The Germans and Italians had been threatening British\nEgypt since late 1940, and led by the capable General Erwin\nRommel, seemed to be on the brink of victory in the spring of\n1942. Hitler\u2019s decision to invade southern Russia was based on\nthe expectation that the Middle East would soon fall into Axis\nhands. In November, the first American combat troops entered\nthe European war, landing in French Morocco, where French\nVichy forces switched sides and joined the struggle to defeat the\nAxis. The Americans pushed the Germans and Italians eastward\nwhile the British, after defeating Rommel at El Alamein in\nEgypt, began rolling the Axis armies back to the west. By early\n1943, the Allies had pushed Axis forces into Tunisia and then out\nof Africa. Modern World History 405\nDouglas \u201cDevastators\u201d aboard USS Enterprise being prepared for takeoff during the\nbattle of Midway, June 4, 1942.\nMeanwhile, the Americans gradually stopped Japanese\nexpansion in the Pacific. In the summer of 1942, American\nnaval victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the aircraft\ncarrier duel at the Battle of Midway crippled Japan\u2019s Pacific\nnaval operations. The battles were the first time two naval fleets\nengaged one another by air and not by sea. At Coral Sea, the\nU.S. Navy blocked the Japanese threat to Australia; Midway\neliminated Japan\u2019s advance toward Hawaii, while sinking three\nJapanese aircraft carriers which were irreplaceable, as Japan did\nnot have the industrial capacity to replenish its fleet. The U.S.,\nin contrast, was producing ships almost by the day. 406 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nTo dislodge Japan\u2019s hold\nover the Pacific, the U.S.\nbegan attacking island after\nisland, bypassing the\nstrongest but seizing those\ncapable of holding airfields to\ncontinue pushing Japan out of\nthe region. Combat was\nvicious. At Guadalcanal\nJapanese soldiers launched\nMarines rest in the field on Guadalcanal\nsuicidal charges rather than\nsurrender. Many Japanese soldiers refused to be taken prisoner\nor to take prisoners themselves. Such tactics, coupled with\nAmerican racial prejudice, turned the Pacific Theater into a\nmuch more brutal and barbarous conflict than battle in the\nEuropean Theater.\nIn January 1943, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister\nChurchill met at Casablanca to discuss the next step of the\nEuropean war. The meeting leaders also declared that they\nexpected nothing short of unconditional surrender from the\nGermans\u2014to assure Stalin, who still did not trust the Allies to\nkeep their word. At Casablanca, Churchill convinced Roosevelt\nto chase the Axis up the Italian peninsula, into the \u201csoft\nunderbelly\u201d of Europe. Stalin preferred a cross-Channel\ninvasion of France, but the British and Americans were not yet\nprepared in 1943. In July, Allied forces led by General Dwight\nEisenhower crossed the Mediterranean and landed in Sicily.\nThe Italian King dismissed and arrested Mussolini, who escaped\nwith Germany\u2019s help and established a fascist government in\nnorthern Italy. The south, however, switched sides and fought\nalongside the Allies for the rest of the war. However, the advance\nnorthward toward Europe\u2019s \u201csoft underbelly\u201d turned out to be\nmuch tougher than Churchill had imagined. Italy\u2019s narrow,\nmountainous terrain and Mussolini\u2019s newly-formed fascist state\ngave the defending Axis the advantage. Movement up the\npeninsula was slow, and in some battles, conditions returned to\nthe trench-like warfare of World War I as the German armies\nfell back to new defensive positions, exhausting Allied forces in\none battle after another. It would take nearly a year to capture Modern World History 407\nRome, and northern Italy was not liberated until the last weeks\nof the war in 1945.\nDresden after the bombing raid, February 1945.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) sent thousands\nof bombers to England and North Africa in preparation for\na massive strategic bombing campaign against\nGermany\u2014another move to assure Stalin the Allies were\nopening a \u201csecond front\u201d against Germany. The Allies\u2019 plan was\nto bomb German cities around the clock. Initially, U.S. bombers\nfocused on destroying German ball-bearing factories, rail yards,\noil fields, and manufacturing centers during the day because\nthe U.S. was reluctant to target civilians in terror bombings.\nHowever, after the London Blitz, the British felt no\ncompunction against retaliating in kind, and carpet-bombed\nGerman cities at night. By the end of 1944, the Americans\njoined the British in the same strategy, bombing urban\nindustrial targets despite massive civilian casualties. The joint\nRAF-USAAF bombing of the industrial city, Dresden, in\nFebruary 1945, dropped 3,900 tons of high explosives on the\ncity, causing a firestorm that killed 25,000 civilians. 408 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nFlying in formation, the air\nsquadrons initially flew\nunescorted, since many\nbelieved that \u201cflying fortress\u201d\nbombers equipped with\ndefensive firepower flew too\nhigh and too fast to be\nattacked. However, advanced\nGerman technology allowed\nfighters to easily shoot down B-29 \u201cSuper-fortress\u201d in flight during World\nthe lumbering bombers. War II.\nGerman fighter planes shot\ndown almost half of American and British aircraft until long-\nrange escort fighters were developed that allowed the bombers\nhit their targets while fighters confronted opposing German\naircraft.\nHistorians still debate the effectiveness of the Allied bombing\ncampaign against both Germany and Japan, and the overall\nusefulness of bombing civilians in World War II. The Germans\nactually increased production of war materiel during the war,\nrelocating factories and streamlining production. German and\nJapanese civilians, like the Londoners in 1940, learned to live\nwith aerial attacks instead of rising up to overthrow their own\ngovernments and sue for peace. Critics of terror-bombing argue\nthat targeting civilians rarely results in surrender, and instead\noften stiffens a country\u2019s resolve to fight on and inflict the same\nterror on its foe.

Roosevelt, and Winston\nChurchill on the portico of the Russian Embassy during the Tehran Conference to\ndiscuss the European Theatre in 1943.\nIn the wake of the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, Roosevelt,\nChurchill, and Stalin met in Tehran in November 1943.\nDismissing Africa and Italy as a sideshow, Stalin demanded that\nBritain and the United States invade France to support the\nSoviet advance on the Eastern Front. Churchill was hesitant,\nbut Roosevelt was eager. The invasion was tentatively scheduled\nfor May 1944. The leaders also began post-war planning,\nconsidering the best ways to prevent another world war and\nGreat Depression. The Allies had already begun calling\nthemselves the \u201cUnited Nations,\u201d especially as Latin American\nrepublics and other countries began joining the fight against\nthe Axis. In April 1945, diplomats gathered in San Francisco to\ndesign a way for the United Nations to address world problems\nin a post-war world.\nTo avoid another Great Depression and to reconstruct war-\ntorn nations, in 1944 the Allies also sent representatives to the\nBretton Woods resort in New Hampshire to forge new\ninternational financial, trade, and developmental relationships. 410 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe results of both conferences will be discussed below, but it is\nimportant to notice that both international meetings were held\nin the United States. Americans had become convinced that\nisolationism was not longer a practical foreign policy, and the\nworld recognized that the U.S. was going to be instrumental in a\npost-war effort to keep the peace.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did the different wartime experiences of the Allies\ninfluence the goals of the \u201cBig Three\u201d leaders, Stalin, Churchill,\nand Roosevelt?\n\u2022 If terror-bombing civilian populations is ineffective, why did\neveryone continue doing it?\nThe Conclusion\nThe photograph \u201cInto the Jaws of Death\u201d shows American troops, part of the U.S. 1st\nInfantry Division, leaving a Higgins Boat on Omaha Beach.\nOn the same day the American army entered Rome, American,\nBritish and Canadian forces launched Operation Overlord, the\nlong-awaited invasion of France. D-Day, as it became known, Modern World History 411\nwas the largest amphibious assault in history. American general\nDwight Eisenhower was uncertain enough of the attack\u2019s\nchances that the night before the invasion he wrote two\nspeeches: one for success and one for failure. Using over 5,000\nlanding and assault craft, about 160,000 men crossed the\nEnglish Channel on D-Day. The Allied landings at Normandy\nwere successful, and by the end of the month 875,000 Allied\ntroops had arrived in France. Paris was liberated in late August.\nAllied bombing sorties intensified, continuing to level\nGerman cities and reduce Axis industrial capacity. The Royal\nAir Force estimated that the Allies destroyed more than half\nof the \u201cbuilt up areas\u201d in seven of the ten German cities with\nmore than 500,000 residents. The RAF\u2019s goal, similar to that of\nGermany during the Blitz, was for bombing to be \u201cfocused on\nthe morale of the enemy civil population and in particular of\nthe industrial workers.\u201d The USAAF flew over 750,000 bomber\nsorties and dropped nearly a million and a half tons of bombs.\nUp to five hundred thousand German civilians were killed by\nallied bombing.\nBritish Sherman \u201cFirefly\u201d tank in Namur on the Meuse River, December 1944 412 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe Nazi armies were crumbling on both fronts. Hitler tried to\nturn the war in his favor in the west. The Battle of the Bulge in\nDecember 1944 and January 1945 was the largest and deadliest\nsingle battle fought by U.S. troops in the war. The desperate\nGermans failed to drive the Allies back from the Ardennes\nforests to the English Channel, but the delay cost the western-\nfront Allies the winter. The invasion of Germany would have\nto wait, while the Soviet Union continued its relentless push\nfrom the east, ravaging German populations in retribution for\nGerman war crimes. German counterattacks failed to prevent\nthe Soviet advance and 1945 dawned with the end of European\nwar in sight.\nThe Big Three met at Yalta in February 1945 to discuss their joint occupation of\nGermany and plans for postwar Europe.\nIn February 1945, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met again\nat Yalta, located on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea.\nRoosevelt and Churchill were anxious for Soviet help in\ndefeating Japan; the atom bomb was months away from being\ntested and no one knew whether it would work. Stalin agreed to Modern World History 413\njoin the fight in Asia against Japan three months after peace was\ndeclared in Europe.\nThe three leaders discussed their own long-range strategic\ninterests at Yalta. Stalin, whose country had sacrificed the most\nin the war, insisted on defending the Soviet Union from future\ninvasion by occupying Eastern Europe. Remembering British\nand U.S. support of the White Russians in the Civil War he\nhad fought in the 1920s, Stalin distrusted his temporary allies\nagainst Germany. Partly to destabilize the capitalist nations he\ndistrusted, and partly because he was still a dedicated\nrevolutionary, Stalin also wanted to continue to promote\ncommunism around the world.\nChurchill, for his part, continued to believe that the colonial\nEuropean empires in Africa and Asia should continue as before\n(the French also supported this position). Roosevelt\u2019s main\ninterest was maintaining the economic boom that had pulled\nthe United States out of the Great Depression through free\ninternational trade. The war had put people back to work and\nthe nation was at near full employment. Since U.S. was not\nbombed, American industry was in a position to supply the\nworld and American firms to dominate world markets.\nAlthough the three nations shared the victory in World War\nTwo, in the long run, the United States \u201cdefeated\u201d its allies.\nThe European empires Churchill hoped to save were ended by\nthe 1960s with the independence of Asian and African colonies\nand Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union and domination of Eastern Europe\ndramatically collapsed in 1989-1991. Roosevelt\u2019s position was\nthe most successful in the long run. Free trade exists throughout\nthe world, and is currently embraced by industrially-developing\nnations as a means for economic growth. However, nothing lasts\nforever: the United States is beginning to lose its position as the\nleader of the capitalist world\u2014we will discuss this change in a\nlater chapter. 414 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSoviet troops reached\nGermany in January 1945, and\nthe Americans crossed the\nRhine in March.

The leaders agreed that Germany would\nbe divided into pieces according to current Allied occupation,\nwith Berlin likewise divided.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 D-Day is an iconic moment for Americans. What do you think\nsimilar moments would be for Britain and the Soviet Union?\n\u2022 Why did the U.S. and U.S.S.R. race to reach Berlin?\nThe Holocaust\nWe have already seen the application of fascist ideology in\nmurderous atrocities against \u201cinferior people\u201d by the Italians in\nEthiopia and the Japanese in China in the early years of World\nWar Two. Nazi anti-Semitism had revealed its violent aspects in Modern World History 415\nKristallnacht in 1938, but was even more viciously applied once\nGerman armies began conquering Eastern Europe. Ten percent\nof Poland\u2019s pre-war population was Jewish, about 3 million\npeople, who had been subjected to discrimination by the\nauthoritarian Polish government in the 1930s. However, under\nGerman occupation, Jews were forced into overcrowded\nghettoes in certain Polish cities. The areas captured by the\nWehrmacht in the western Soviet Union during Operation\nBarbarossa added millions of Jews to Nazi-occupied Europe.\nWhile Hitler and his government had briefly considered\nsending Jews to far-off exile outside of Europe, ultimately the\nF\u00fchrer decided that their physical elimination was necessary\u2014a\n\u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the \u201cJewish Problem.\u201d Mass shootings by\nspecialized troops called Einsatzgruppen accompanied the\ninvasion of the Soviet Union. In October 1941, outside of the\nUkrainian capital of Kiev, Jewish men were forced to dig mass\npits in the Babi Yar ravine into which they and their families\nwere herded naked and shot by Einsatzgruppen and Ukrainian\ncollaborators. Babi Yar was among the largest mass shootings of\nthe war.\nOfficer executes those who survived the initial shooting, October 1942.\nDuring Operation Barbarossa, the Germans also captured\nmillions of Soviet troops, who they herded into prisoner-of-war 416 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ncamps and basically starved to death. At least two million Soviet\nsoldiers died this way. Non-Russians in these camps, Balts and\nUkrainians, were given the option to join special guard units\nand collaborate with the Germans. As the mass shootings took\ntheir psychological toll on German soldiers and guardsmen,\nthese non-Germans were called upon to murder Jewish civilians\nand patrol the ghettoes and concentration camps.\nEven before the war began,\n\u201cmercy killing\u201d had become a\nNazi policy in German\npsychiatric and mental\ninstitutions, where those with\nphysical and mental\ndisabilities were denied care\nand murdered. Shortly after\ndefeating Poland, Hitler\nordered the elimination of all\n\u201cdefectives\u201d.

Europe, some Jews were\nsaved by their Christian\nneighbors, hidden in attics, barns, and even in churches and\nmonasteries until the end of the war. But even then, they were\nnot always safe. The German-Jewish Frank family had moved\nto the Netherlands to escape the Nazi regime in late 1933. They\nhad hoped that Holland would be a safe haven in a new\nEuropean war since it had remained neutral in World War One.\nHowever, the Germans occupied the country along with\nBelgium and France in 1940, and by 1942, were sending Dutch\nJews in transports to the East. The Frank family was able to hide\nin an annex with others, supplied with food and news of the war\nby a group of Dutch friends active in the underground\nresistance. However, they were discovered by German\nauthorities in August 1944, and sent off to the camps. Young\nAnne Frank had kept a diary during their two years in hiding,\nand her father, who survived the war, published it in 1947.\nAlthough Anne Frank\u2019s diary has become one of the most\nimportant records of the Holocaust, the Germans themselves\nwere good at keeping records of their actions against Jews and\nothers. New details emerge frequently of the extent and reach\nof the Holocaust, concentration camps, and slave labor. Despite\nthe efforts of some to deny the Holocaust, there is no doubt: it\nreally happened.\nHowever, during the war itself, it was difficult for the Allies\nto believe rumors and reports they were receiving of atrocities,\nmass executions, and death camps in Nazi-occupied Europe.\nPolish resistance fighter Jan Karski was smuggled into the\nWarsaw ghetto and a transit camp in order to witness how the\nJews were treated. He saw teenage Hitler Youth members\nwalking into the ghetto to casually murder a Jew or two and\nJewish families destined for extermination packed into rail cars. 418 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nIt was difficult for Roosevelt, Churchill and others to believe\nhis report, given in-person in Washington and London. When\nKarski described what he had seen to U.S. Supreme Court\nJustice Felix Frankfurter, a Jewish-American, Frankfurter\nreplied, \u201cI know you are telling the truth, but I don\u2019t believe\nyou\u201d; expressing the world\u2019s incredulity that the Germans could\nperpetrate such atrocities.\nFritz Klein, the camp doctor, standing in a mass grave at Bergen-Belsen after the\ncamp\u2019s liberation by the British 11th Armoured Division, April 1945\nAs the Allies pushed into Germany and Poland, they uncovered\nthe full extent of Hitler\u2019s genocidal policies.

Allied officers often forced German civilians to visit\nthe camps in their towns and regions in order to witness the\nconsequences of Nazi and fascist ideology that the \u201cother\u201d must\nbe eliminated. Since then, Germany has been forced to come\nto terms with this history, and most Germans have tried to\nconfront their past honestly. This effort has been unusual: not\nonly have the Turks, Japanese, and others not addressed their\nactions, white treatment of non-white populations has often\nbeen passed over. Europeans intentionally mass murdering\nother Europeans, and using industrial methods, was\nunacceptable. The atrocities of Europeans against colonized\npeoples in Africa, Asia, and the American West seemed more\nacceptable, and were rarely addressed, due to a legacy of\ninstitutionalized racism. But the violence was very real to the\nCongolese, Native Americans, Indians, and U.S. Blacks.\nThe attempted elimination of the entire Jewish population\nin Europe has had other geopolitical effects. The Holocaust\nseemed to prove the Zionist thesis correct: that the Jews would\nnever be safe unless they established their own homeland. This\nwas achieved in Israel three years after the war ended in Europe;\nbut not, as we shall see, without long-term consequences for\nthe Palestinian Arabs and the rest of the Middle East. News of\nthe death of six million Jews was especially difficult for Jewish-\nAmericans, who suddenly realized that they were nearly the last\nsurviving remnant of an ancient people after their relatives and\nloved ones were murdered in Hitler\u2019s camps. Previously Jewish\nlife had been centered in Poland and the Ukraine; now it was in\nthe United States and Israel.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why was the German killing of 11 million people in the\nHolocaust so difficult for people to believe?\n\u2022 What do you think motivates people who insist the Holocaust\ndidn\u2019t happen? 420 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPacific War\nAs the Allies, especially the\nAmericans, celebrated V-E\n(Victory in Europe) Day, they\nredirected their full attention\nto the still-raging Pacific War.\nIn 1944 and 1945, the\nJapanese military continue to\nfight tenaciously in defeat\nafter defeat. Few battles were\nas one-sided as the Battle of\nthe Philippine Sea in June\n1944, a Japanese counterattack\nthat the Americans called the\nGreat Marianas Turkey Shoot\nfor the number of planes and\nvessels that they sank.

At the cost of nearly their entire force, they inflicted\nalmost thirty thousand casualties before the island was lost in\nearly 1945.\nBy that time, American heavy bombers were in range of the\nJapanese homeland. Bombers hit Japan\u2019s industrial facilities but\nsuffered high casualties. To spare bomber crews from dangerous\ndaylight raids and to achieve maximum effect against Japanese\nmorale, American bombers began night raids, dropping\nincendiary weapons that created massive firestorms consuming\nthe wood-and-paper houses of the residential neighborhoods.\nOver sixty Japanese cities were fire-bombed; one hundred\nthousand civilians in Tokyo died in a single attack in March\n1945. Modern World History 421\nIn June 1945, after eighty\ndays of fighting and tens of\nthousands of casualties, the\nAmericans captured the\nisland of Okinawa. The\nhomeland of Japan was open\nbefore them. Okinawa was a\nviable base from which to\nlaunch a full invasion of the\nJapanese homeland and end\nthe war.

Early in the war,\nfearing that German scientists might develop an atomic bomb,\nthe German-Hungarian-American physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd had\nwritten a letter to Franklin Roosevelt which Albert Einstein\nsigned, warning of a nuclear-armed Hitler. After some debate,\nother American physicists acknowledged the possibility. The\nU.S. government responded in 1942 with the Manhattan Project,\na hugely expensive, ambitious program to create a single\nweapon capable of leveling an entire city. Three years later,\nthe Americans successfully exploded the world\u2019s first nuclear\ndevice, Trinity, in New Mexico in July 1945 while Allied leaders\nwere meeting in Potsdam. Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the\ndirector of the Los Alamos Laboratory where the bomb was\ndesigned, later recalled that the event reminded him of a line 422 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nfrom Hindu scripture: \u201cNow I am become death, the destroyer\nof worlds.\u201d\nNagasaki before and after the bombing and the fires.\nTwo more bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man, were quickly built\nand detonated over two Japanese cities in August. The\nHiroshima bomb was dropped at 8:15 on the morning of August\n6. Over one hundred thousand civilians were killed. On August\n9, the second bomb, Fat Man, was scheduled to be dropped on\nthe castle town of Kokura. But the town was obscured by clouds,\nso the mission proceeded to the secondary target, Nagasaki,\nan important port city on the southern island, Kyushu, with\na population of about a quarter-million people. The Fat Man Modern World History 423\nbomb detonated over the Mitsubishi munitions factory and the\ncity arsenal. About eighty thousand civilians were killed.\nIn addition to the American atom bomb attacks, on August\n9th, Soviet forces invaded Manchuria and overthrew the\nJapanese puppet state of Manchukuo. On August 10th, Japanese\ncabinet ministers agreed to the Allied terms for surrender.\nEmperor Hirohito endorsed their decision on August 15 and\nannounced the surrender of Japan.

Government spending during the four\nyears of war doubled all federal spending in all of American\nhistory up to that point.

The Roosevelt\nadministration urged citizens to save their earnings or buy war\nbonds to prevent inflation. Bond drives headlined by\nHollywood celebrities were hugely successful. They not only\nfunded much of the war effort, they helped tame inflation as\nwell. So too did high tax rates. The federal government raised\nincome taxes and boosted the top marginal tax rate to 94\npercent.\nPresident Roosevelt and his administration encouraged all able-\nbodied American men and women to help the war effort. He\nconsidered the role of women in the war critical for American\nvictory, and the public expected women to free men for active\nmilitary service. While most women opted to remain at home 426 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nor volunteer with charitable organizations, many went to work\nor put on a military uniform. World War II brought\nunprecedented labor opportunities for American women.\nIndustrial labor, normally dominated by men, shifted to women\nfor the duration of wartime mobilization. Women got jobs in\nnew munitions factories. The image of Rosie the Riveter\ninscribed with the phrase \u201cWe Can Do It!\u201d encouraged female\nfactory labor during the war. And over a million administrative\njobs at the local, state, and national levels were transferred from\nmen to women for the duration of the war; often permanently. Modern World History 427\n\u201cWe Can Do It!\u201d by J. Howard Miller was made as an inspirational image to boost worker\nmorale.\nFor women who chose not to work in factories or government\nservice, many volunteer opportunities presented themselves.\nThe American Red Cross, the largest charitable organization\nin the nation, encouraged women to volunteer with local city\nchapters. Millions of women organized community social\nevents for families, packed and shipped almost half a million\ntons of medical supplies, and prepared twenty-seven million\ncare packages for American and other Allied prisoners of war. 428 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe American Red Cross required all female volunteers to\ncertify as nurse\u2019s aides, providing an extra benefit and work\nopportunity for hospital staffs that suffered severe personnel\nlosses.\nMilitary service was\nanother option for women\nwho wanted to join the war\neffort.

Many former military women faced\ndifficulty obtaining veteran\u2019s benefits during their transition to\ncivilian life. The nation that called for assistance to millions\nof women during the four-year crisis seemed unprepared to\naccommodate their postwar needs and demands. But many\nwomen who had answered the call refused to step back into the\nshadows and pushed forward, igniting a struggle that eventually\nbecame the Women\u2019s Movement. Modern World History 429\nIn early 1941, months\nbefore the Japanese attack on\nPearl Harbor, A. Philip\nRandolph, president of the\nBrotherhood of Sleeping Car\nPorters, the largest black\ntrade union in the nation, had\nmade headlines by\nthreatening President\nRoosevelt with a march on\nWashington, D.C. In this\n\u201ccrisis of democracy,\u201d\nRandolph said, defense\nindustries refused to hire\nA. Phillip Randolph in 1942.\nAfrican Americans and the\narmed forces remained\nsegregated. In exchange for Randolph calling off the march,\nRoosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, banning racial and\nreligious discrimination in defense industries and establishing\nthe Fair Employment Practice Committee to monitor defense\nindustry hiring practices. While the armed forces remained\nsegregated throughout the war, the order showed that the\nfederal government could stand against discrimination. The\nblack workforce in defense industries rose from 3 percent in\n1942 to 9 percent in 1945.\nMore than one million African Americans fought in the war.\nMost blacks served in segregated, noncombat units led by white\nofficers. Some gains were made, however. The number of black\nofficers increased from five in 1940 to over seven thousand in\n1945. And all-black fighter and bomber squadrons, known as\nthe Tuskegee Airmen, completed more than 1,500 missions and\nearned several hundred merits and medals. Black pilots of the\n332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47\nThunderbolts red and many bomber crews specifically\nrequested the \u201cRed Tail Angels\u201d as escorts. Near the end of the\nwar, the army and navy began integrating some of their units\nand facilities, before the U.S. government finally ordered the full\nintegration of its armed forces in 1948. 430 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nWhile some black\nAmericans served in the\narmed forces, others on the\nhome front became riveters\nand welders, rationed food\nand gasoline, and bought\nvictory bonds.

To achieve double victory and \u201creal\ndemocracy,\u201d the Courier encouraged its readers to enlist in the\narmed forces or volunteer on the home front, and fight against\nracial segregation and discrimination. During the war,\nmembership in the NAACP jumped tenfold, from fifty thousand\nto five hundred thousand. The Congress of Racial Equality,\nformed in 1942, proposed nonviolent direct action to achieve\ndesegregation. Between 1940 and 1950, 1.5 million southern\nblacks also demonstrated their opposition to racism and\nviolence by migrating out of the Jim Crow South to the North.\nBut transitions were not easy. Racial tensions erupted in 1943 in\na series of riots in cities such as Mobile, Beaumont, and Harlem.\nThe bloodiest race riot occurred in Detroit and resulted in the\ndeath of twenty-five blacks and nine whites. Still, the war ignited\nin African Americans an urgency for equality that they would\ncarry with them into the subsequent years.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 431\n\u2022 How were the experiences of women and African Americans\nduring the war similar?\n\u2022 How were they different?\nMany Americans had to navigate American prejudice, and\nAmerica\u2019s entry into the war left foreign nationals from the\nenemy nations in a precarious position. The Federal Bureau\nof Investigation targeted many on suspicions of disloyalty for\ndetainment, hearings, and internment under the Alien Enemy\nAct.

How did\nAmerica respond?\nInitially, American officials had expressed little official concern\nfor Nazi persecutions. As the first signs of trouble became clear\nin the late 1930s, the State Department and most U.S. embassies\ndid little to aid European Jews. President Roosevelt publicly\nspoke out against persecution and even withdrew the U.S.\nambassador to Germany after Kristallnacht, the pogrom against Modern World History 433\nGerman Jews in 1938 that had caused even former German\nKaiser Wilhelm II to say \u201cFor the first time, I am ashamed to\nbe German.\u201d Roosevelt pushed for the 1938 Evian Conference in\nFrance, where international leaders discussed the Jewish refugee\nproblem and worked to expand Jewish immigration quotas. But\nthe conference came to nothing, and the United States turned\naway countless Jewish refugees who requested asylum in the\nUnited States. In 1939, the German ship St. Louis, carrying over\nnine hundred Jewish refugees, could not find a country that\nwould take them. Passengers were not granted visas under the\nU.S. quota system.

First lady Eleanor\nRoosevelt endorsed the measure, but the president remained\npublicly silent. The bipartisan bill was introduced by a 434 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nDemocratic senator and a Republican representative and\nsupported by religious and labor groups, but was opposed by\nnationalist organizations. It never came to a vote in the Senate\nbecause it was blocked by a North Carolina Democrat whose\nsupport Roosevelt needed on military spending bills. The\npresident, anxious to protect the New Deal and his rearmament\nprograms, was unwilling to expend political capital to save\nforeign children that even leaders of his own party had little\ninterest in protecting.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How did racism and prejudice affect the U.S. response to the\nJewish refugee problem and Japanese internment?\nThe US was lucky that none of the war was fought on American\nsoil, but 419,400 US servicemen died in the conflict. World War\nII was the deadliest war in history. Military deaths were over\n25 million, including 5 million prisoners of war who died in\ncustody. The war also killed about 55 million civilians, including\n28 million who died of war-related disease and famine. The\nnumber of wounded has not been accurately documented, but Modern World History 435\nMore\nwas probably similar to or greater than the death toll.\nthan half those casualties were in\nRussia and China. The Chinese death\ntoll was at least 20 million. The Soviet\nUnion lost 11,400,000 men in battle,\n10 million civilians in war-related\nactivities, and about 7 million through\nfamine caused by the war, for a total\nof about 28 million. These losses\namounted to about 14% of the U.S.S.R.\u2019s\n1940 population. Germany lost over 5\nmillion soldiers and up to 3 million\ncivilians.\nAmericans celebrated the end of the war after V-J Day in August\n1945. At home and abroad, the United States wanted a postwar\norder that would guarantee global peace and domestic\nprosperity. Although the alliance of convenience with Stalin\u2019s\nSoviet Union would rapidly collapse, Americans nevertheless\nlooked for the means to ensure postwar stability and economic\nsecurity for returning veterans. The inability of the League of\nNations to stop German, Italian, and Japanese aggressions\ncaused many to question whether any global organization could\neffectively ensure world peace. Skeptics included Franklin\nRoosevelt, who, as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s undersecretary of the\nnavy, had witnessed the rejection of The League\u2019s ideal of world\ngovernance by both the American people and the Senate.\nIn 1941, Roosevelt believed postwar security could best be\nmaintained by an informal agreement between what he termed\nthe Four Policemen: the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union,\nand China. But others, including Roosevelt\u2019s secretary of state\nCordell Hull and British prime minister Winston Churchill,\nconvinced the president to push for a new global organization.\nAs the war ran its course, both Roosevelt and the American\npublic came around to the idea of the United Nations. Pollster\nGeorge Gallup noted a \u201cprofound change\u201d in American\nattitudes. In 1937 only a third of Americans polled supported\nthe idea of an international organization. But as war broke out 436 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nin Europe, half of Americans did. America\u2019s entry into the war\nbolstered support, and by 1945, 81 percent of Americans favored\nthe idea.\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt had\nalways supported the ideals\nenshrined in the United\nNations charter. In January\n1941, he described Four\nFreedoms that all of the\nworld\u2019s citizens should enjoy:\nfreedom of speech, freedom\nof worship, freedom from\nwant, and freedom from fear.\nEleanor Roosevelt with the Universal\nRoosevelt signed the Atlantic Declaration of Human Rights, 1949.\nCharter with Churchill,\nreinforcing those ideas and adding the right of self-\ndetermination and promising some sort of economic and\npolitical cooperation. Roosevelt first used the term united\nnations to describe the Allied powers, not the subsequent\npostwar organization. But the name stuck.\nAt Tehran in 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill convinced Stalin\nto send a Soviet delegation to a conference in August 1944,\nwhere they agreed on the basic structure of the new\norganization. It would have a Security Council consisting of\nthe original Four Policemen and France, that would consult on\nhow best to keep the peace and when to deploy the military\npower of the assembled nations. In a shift from the unarmed\ndiplomacy of the League of Nations, the U.N. would have a\nmilitary. The plan was a hybrid between Roosevelt\u2019s policemen\nidea and a global organization of equal representation. There\nwould also be a General Assembly made up of all nations, an\nInternational Court of Justice, and a council for economic and\nsocial matters. The Soviets expressed concern over how the\nSecurity Council would work, but the powers agreed to meet\nagain in San Francisco between April and June 1945 for further\nnegotiations. There, on June 26, 1945, fifty nations signed the\nU.N. charter. Modern World History 437\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Reflect on the death toll. Which nations paid the highest\nprice? How might this affect their post-war attitudes in\ninternational negotiations?\n\u2022 How did the United Nations attempt to be a more useful\nforce for world peace?\nAnticipating victory in World War II, American leaders not only\nplanned the postwar global order, they planned for the\nreturning servicemen. American politicians and business\nleaders wanted to avoid another economic depression by\ngradually easing returning veterans back into the civilian\neconomy. The brainchild of William Atherton, the head of the\nAmerican Legion, the G.I. Bill won support from progressives\nand conservatives alike. Passed in 1944, the G.I. Bill was a\nmultibillion-dollar entitlement program that rewarded\nhonorably-discharged veterans with a range of important\nbenefits.\nFaced with the prospect of\nover fifteen million members\nof the armed services\n(including approximately\n350,000 women) suddenly\nreturning to civilian life, the\nG.I. Bill offered a variety of\nincentives to slow their return\nto the civilian workforce as\nwell as reward their service\nwith public benefits. The\nlegislation offered a year\u2019s\nworth of unemployment\nincome for veterans unable to\nsecure work. About half of\nA government poster informing soldiers American veterans (eight\nabout the G.I. Bill\nmillion) received a total of $4 438 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nbillion in unemployment benefits over the life of the bill. The\nG.I. Bill also made a college education a reality for many. The\nVeterans Administration paid educational expenses including\ntuition, fees, supplies, and even stipends for living expenses,\nsparking a boom in higher education. Enrollments at accredited\ncolleges, universities, technical, and professional schools spiked\nfrom 1.5 million in 1940 to 3.6 million in 1960. The VA disbursed\nover $14 billon in educational aid in just over a decade.\nFurthermore, the G.I. Bill encouraged home ownership.\nRoughly 40 percent of Americans owned homes in 1945, but\nthat figure climbed to 60 percent a decade after the close of\nthe war. Because the bill did away with down payment\nrequirements, veterans could obtain home loans for as little\nas $1 down. Close to four million veterans purchased homes\nthrough the G.I. Bill, sparking a construction bonanza that\npropelled postwar growth. In addition, the V.A. helped nearly\ntwo hundred thousand veterans buy farms and offered\nthousands more guaranteed financing for small businesses. The\neffects of the G.I. Bill were significant and long-lasting. It helped\nsustain the great postwar economic boom and established the\nhallmarks of American middle class life.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How much of a role do you think government assistance to\nveterans through the G.I. Bill played in the post-war era?\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Marines_with_LVT(A)-5_in_Iwo_Jima_1945 \u00a9 Fifth\nMarine Division photographer is licensed under a\nPublic Domain license\n\u2022 Selassie_on_Time_Magazine_cover_1930 \u00a9 Time\nMagazine is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Soviet_armor_in_the_spanish_civil_war \u00a9 Textidor is Modern World History 439\nlicensed under a CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license\n\u2022 2560px-Francisco_Franco_1930 \u00a9 Unknown is\nlicensed under a CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license\n\u2022 GUERNICA \u00a9 Picasso is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Bad Godesberg, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Vorbereitung\n\u00a9 Bundesarchiv, Bild is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Anschluss \u00d6sterreich, Wien \u00a9 Bundesarchiv is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H27337,_Moskau,_Stalin_und\n_Ribbentrop_im_Kreml \u00a9 Bundesarchiv is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 2880px-Manchukuo_map_1939.svg \u00a9 Emok is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Chinese_to_be_beheaded_in_Nanking_Massacre \u00a9\nH.J.Timperley is licensed under a Public Domain\nlicense\n\u2022 Contest_To_Cut_Down_100_People \u00a9 Shinju Sato is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 service-pnp-fsa-8d13000-8d13900-8d13979v \u00a9 Roberts\nis licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Russland-S\u00fcd, Panzer III, Sch\u00fctzenpanzer, 23.Pz.Div. \u00a9\nBundesarchiv is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 KK-pes\u00e4ke 100m ryssist\u00e4 n. 5 km Lemetist\u00e4 pohjoiseen.\n\u00a9 Unknown is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H25217,_Henry_Philippe_Pet\nain_und_Adolf_Hitler \u00a9 Bundesarchiv is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Boulton_Paul_Defiant \u00a9 B.J.

In many of Europe\u2019s and the United\nStates\u2019 imperial possessions, the struggle for independence had\nbegun long before World War Two, however. As you\u2019ll recall\nfrom previous chapters, European and American justifications\n443 444 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nfor empire included the claim that people such as Britain\u2019s\nsubjects in India and the America\u2019s in the Philippines were\nunprepared to stand on their own as independent nations. This\nclaim was undermined by the effectiveness of the Indians and\nFilipinos in World War II. Filipinos had proven their value as\nguerrilla fighters. The Japanese only managed to control twelve\nof the forty-eight provinces of the Philippines, and U.S. General\nDouglas MacArthur said, \u201cGive me ten thousand Filipinos and\nI shall conquer the world!\u201d And in imperial possessions like\nIndia, the \u201ccivilizing project\u201d of empire for generations had\nincluding educating local administrators and training military\nand police forces. The leaders of national liberation often came\nout of these experiences reasoning that since they were already\nexperienced at running their own nations as administrators for\nthe empires, it was time for the imperialists to leave.\nFurthermore, the war was full of inspirational examples of\nEuropeans and Asians who fought side by side against the fascist\noccupiers in their conquered nations. The process was\naccelerated by the strain of war on the European imperialists.\nFrance and the Netherlands had been conquered and\nthemselves occupied as imperial subjects by the Germans, while\nthe British were greatly weakened. Modern World History 445\nAfter the war, the nations\nthat had been targeted by\nGermany (Britain, France,\nand the Netherlands) all\nattempted to separate their\nreaction to this attack from\nthe response of colonial\npopulations to their return.\nFor instance, British leaders\nlike Winston Churchill hoped\nand expected to expand their\nempire, which they now\nrenamed a commonwealth,\nand the Anglo-Iranian Oil\nCompany (now BP) had no\nintention of giving back Iran\u2019s\noil fields. This may seem a\nWinston Churchill waving the Victory sign\nto the crowd in Whitehall on the day he strange attitude for a nation\nbroadcast to the nation that the war with\nthat was having trouble\nGermany had been won, 8 May 1945.\nfeeding and housing its own\npopulation and leaned on U.S. aid like a crutch. But the British\nretained their sense of cultural superiority and convinced\nthemselves that their help was still needed to \u201cassist primitive\npeoples in their march to modernity.\u201d\nThe timing of national liberation was complicated by the\ngrowing conflict between the United States and the Soviet\nUnion, which was both a competition to dominate territory\nand control alliances as well as an ideological struggle between\ncapitalism and communism. This conflict was known as the\n\u201cCold War,\u201d since the two countries never directly attacked one\nanother. Instead they fought a series of proxy wars that occurred\nwithin the context of decolonization. Each superpower\ncompeted to recruit more new nations to their side, pouring\nmilitary and economic aid into the new developing countries. 446 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nDespite the Cold War, at\ntimes the process of\nindependence was peacefully\nachieved through mutual\nagreement. In the\nPhilippines, for example, the\nU.S. government handed over\npower to a local Filipino\ngovernment within a year of\nending the war with Japan.\nThe Americans fully\nappreciated the sacrifices\nmade by the Filipinos under\nJapanese occupation and the\ncontributions they had made\nto their own liberation.\nPresident Harry Truman\nrecognized the independence Propaganda poster depicting the Philippine\nresistance movement\nof the Philippines on July 4,\n1946. In the days leading up to\nthe announcement, the American and Filipino governments\nworked out arrangements allowing the U.S. to retain dozens of\nmilitary bases and for American businesses to have preferential\naccess to the raw materials and markets of the newly\nindependent nation.\nSometimes, peaceful political pressure from organized\nmovements also led to liberation. Indian independence,\nexamined below, is the first and prime example of how non-\nviolent protest, boycotts, and moral suasion could result in\nfreedom. However, there are also many cases in which\nindependence could only be achieved through a more violent\nguerrilla struggle, as European imperialists were unwilling to let\ngo of their colonies despite the desires of the colonized.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did leaders like Churchill believe they would be able to Modern World History 447\nreturn to controlling their empires?\n\u2022 Why did colonized people disagree?\nIndependence and Partition in British India\nOne of the earliest examples of decolonization in the post-\nwar era and one that affected an extremely large portion of\nthe world\u2019s population was the British withdrawal from India.\nAs mentioned earlier, India\u2019s long struggle for independence\nhad been led by the India National Congress Party since the\nnineteenth century.\nIndian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol, 1944.\nAfter 700,000 Indians fought for Britain in the Great war, over\n2.5 million soldiers from India fought alongside the British in\nWorld War II. More than 87,000 of them were killed in action.\nThe British Field Marshall in charge of the Indian Army from\n1942 onward said Britain \u201ccouldn\u2019t have come through both\nwars [World War I and World War II] if they hadn\u2019t had the 448 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nIndian Army.\u201d When Britain called Indians to arms a second\ntime, the Muslim League supported the British recruitment.\nHowever, the Indian National Congress demanded\nindependence before it would agree to help Britain again. When\nthe Congress began a \u201cQuit India\u201d campaign in August 1942, the\nBritish imprisoned tens of thousands of leaders for the war\u2019s\nduration until June 1945. Mohandas Gandhi was among those\njailed; he was released in May 1944 due to health concerns.\nBritish war strategy led to a\nmajor famine in Bengal in\n1943 (modern-day\nBangladesh, at the mouth of\nthe Ganges River), and about\n3 million people died of\nstarvation. The Japanese\ninvasion of Burma caused\nBengal famine of 1943: Dead and dying about a half million Indian\nchildren on a Calcutta street published in\nHindu refugees to flee to\nthe Statesman, August 22, 1943.\nneighboring Bengal. At the\nsame time, the British decided to adopt a \u201cscorched-earth\u201d\npolicy in southern Bengal, burning thousands of boats and\ndestroying rice crops so they would not fall into the hands of the\nJapanese, who they assumed would soon extend their invasion.\nPoor harvests and wartime inflation in late 1942-early 1943 sent\ninternal rural refugees into Calcutta, the Bengali capital,\nexacerbating the crisis. The British War Cabinet stalled in\nsending needed grain to the starving Bengalis\u2014perhaps as\npolicy, perhaps because of the strain on wartime shipping. Very\nlittle sympathy was shown for the plight of the Bengalese by the\nleaders of Great Britain. When presented with evidence of the\nmassive famine, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was\nincredulous, reportedly asking, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Gandhi died yet?\u201d\nChurchill was not only aware of Gandhi, he was aware of the\nimportance to India to the British war effort. In addition to 2.5\nmillion soldiers, the British government borrowed billions of\npounds from India to finance the war. And India was no longer\nmerely a site of famines, it was becoming a source of essential\nsupplies. By the end of the war, India had become the world\u2019s Modern World History 449\nfourth largest industrial power and its increased economic and\nmilitary influence paved the way for independence from the\nBritish Empire in 1947.\nJawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi in 1946\nHowever, Indian independence was complicated by internal\ndivisions, some exacerbated by the British themselves during\nmany decades of imperial rule. In particular, the British had\nencouraged division between the majority Hindu and minority\nMuslim populations; sending Hindu troops to police the\nMuslims, and vice versa. Gandhi sought to eliminate the Hindu\ncaste system which deprived the poorest Indians of hope. Castes\nwere an integral part of Hinduism, but under British rule the\nsystem had been expanded and the number of divisions had 450 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nbeen increased because the foreign rulers found it useful in\ntheir divide-and-conquer strategy.\nReligious divisions seeped into the independence movement\nas well. While Gandhi simply wished for an independent, united\nIndia after the end of British rule, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and\nthe Muslim League lobbied for the establishment of two states\nin the territory. Jinnah proposed the creation of a Hindu India\nand an Islamic \u201cPure Land\u201d called Pakistan. Jinnah\u2019s position\nwas embraced by Hindu nationalists who wanted to be rid of\nthe Muslim minority. As independence was being negotiated\nafter the war, escalating religious violence suggested that British\nwithdrawal might result in a bloody civil war. Muslims and\nHindus attacked each other in different towns and cities, so\nCongress Party leader Jawaharlal Nehru (who would become the\nfirst Prime Minister of India) accepted the partition of India\nfrom Pakistan. The new Muslim nation at the time included\nboth the present territory of Pakistan in the west and the eastern\nregion now called Bangladesh.\nAfter independence in August\n1947, the partition created a\ncentral Hindu nation with two\nborders into Muslim Pakistan\nto the east and west. These\nnew, arbitrarily-drawn\nborders resulted in the\ndisplacement of 12 million\npeople, as the former British\nsubjects fled their homes to\njoin the new nations that\nFour nations (India, Pakistan, Dominion of\nCeylon, and Union of Burma) that gained matched their religions.\nindependence in 1947 and 1948 Millions died during the\nchaos of the migration and\nthe refugee crises that followed. But even partition was not\nenough for some Hindu nationalists. Gandhi himself was\nassassinated by one such extremist shortly after he achieved his\ndream of independence, in January 1948.\nNot only was partition an imperfect solution to religious\ndifferences the British empire had exacerbated, but the Modern World History 451\narbitrary borders were drawn hastily. The state of Kashmir in\nnorthern India is still disputed territory. In 1947, a local Hindu\nprince convinced the British that the majority-Muslim region\nshould stay with India. The Government of Pakistan and many\nlocal Kashmiris continue to protest this, causing internal and\nexternal conflicts. Since both India and Pakistan are now nuclear\nnations, the ongoing Kashmir dispute is a legacy of imperialism\nthat may still endanger regional or even global peace.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 In what ways were the British responsible for the antagonism\nbetween India and Pakistan since independence?\nIsrael\nIndia was not the only region of the world from which Britain\nwalked away soon after World War Two. Another was Palestine.\nAfter World War I, Britain had been given a \u201cmandate\u201d to\nadminister Palestine along with the oil-rich regions of Arabia\nand Iraq. Between the wars the British continued to allow\nZionists, advocates of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, to\npurchase land and move into the region. Migration of Zionist\nJews to the region had begun in the late nineteenth century.\nThis \u201csecond wave\u201d of Zionist settlers included dedicated\nsocialists who created cooperative farms called kibbutzim, and\nurban Europeans who built cities like Tel Aviv\u2014one of the\nprime examples of the Bauhaus architectural style popular in\nGermany in the 1920s. However, accelerating Zionist\nimmigration increased tensions with the Palestinian Arabs who\nhad lived in the region for centuries. Competition for land and\nwater, as well as for political dominance, resulted in violent riots\nbetween Arabs and Zionists in 1921, and a longer Arab revolt in\nPalestine from 1936 to 1939. 452 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nZina Dizengoff Circle in Tel Aviv in the 1940s.\nAs mentioned previously, the Nazi Holocaust seemed to prove\nthe Zionist thesis: that Jews would never be safe in Europe and\nneeded to establish their own homeland. The British considered\na petition to allow 100,000 refugee survivors of the Nazi camps\nto resettle in Palestine, but hesitated due to opposition from\nPalestinian Arabs and the nearby Arab states. Zionist settlers\nhad already formed a mutual defense force, the Haganah, in the\n1920s. After the war, the Haganah turned to sabotage against the\nBritish occupation and organizing illicit arms shipments.

The Irgun\nalso led a terror attack on the\nPalestinian town of Deir\nHassin in 1948, in which over\na hundred perished,\nincluding women and\nIsrael\u2019s sixth prime minister, Menachem\nchildren. Despite apologies Begin, was Irgun leader at the time of the\nfrom more mainstream attack, though he claimed he was not\npresent.\nZionist groups (and, later, the\nIsraeli government), the Deir\nHassin massacre has served as a rallying cry and a justification\nfor terror attacks against Israelis by different Palestinian-related\nterrorist groups ever since.\nIn 1947, the British relinquished their \u201cmandate\u201d over\nPalestine to the new United Nations, which tried to develop a\nnew map for a Jewish homeland\u2014the new state of Israel\u2014while\ntaking into account the presence of the Arab Palestinians. The\nZionists received more land than could be justified by their\nnumbers at the time, as well as some of the more valuable\nagricultural and water resources. As the British withdrew in\nMay 1948, Israel declared its independence based on the U.N.\nborders, which the both the local Arabs and the neighboring\nArab countries had rejected. Israel\u2019s new neighbors immediately\ndeclared war, but the new nation had powerful allies and was\nwilling to fight for its survival. Israel defended itself and actually\nextended its borders. The Israelis claimed they needed to have\na wider defensive perimeter and that the Arab Palestinians had\nabandoned many of their towns anyway; which many had\nbecause they thought the Arabs would win a decisive victory.\nIsrael eventually destroyed over 500 Arab villages and cleared\nout Arab neighborhoods in major cities, causing the over\n800,000 \u201ctemporary\u201d Muslim and Christian war refugees to 454 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nseek more permanent shelter in neighboring Arab nations. A\nseries of wars in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982 continued the\nconflict.\nIsrael expanding as Palestine shrinks, in an image produced by Palestinian activists.\nWith tenacity, superior organization, and a lot of aid from the\nUnited States and Europe, the Israelis held their own in these\nconflicts and embraced an ongoing expansion of the Israeli area\nof settlement in a policy of creating \u201cfacts on the ground.\u201d The\nArab world, considering Israel an arbitrary creation of western\npowers, refused to recognize Israel as a legitimate state. Peace\nprocesses with individual Arab nations have brought\nagreements and diplomatic recognition from Egypt in 1979, to\nwhom Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula, taken in the 1967\nwar; and Jordan in 1994, which relinquished its claim to the\nPalestinian West Bank of the Jordan River.\nWeariness with war and terror, and a desire to qualify for U.S.\nmilitary and economic aid, have led the United Arab Emirates,\nBahrain, and Sudan to recognize Israel in 2020. But it is one\nthing to have recognition from a government, and another\nthing to be accepted as a nation by the \u201cArab Street\u201d. Ordinary\nArab people are often tired of authoritarian rule in their own Modern World History 455\ncountries, and are more supportive of the Palestinian Arab\ncause than the governments ruling them.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Is it surprising that Palestinians resent Israel\u2019s existence?\n\u2022 Do you think the major issue is anti-Semitism, when both\nMuslim and Christian Arabs have fought Israel?\n\u2022 How might the extremely high level of financial and military\nIsrael receives from the U.S. complicate Middle-eastern\ndiplomacy for both the Israelis and the Americans?\n\u201cBritish\u201d Kenya\nAlthough Great Britain had\nretreated relatively peacefully\nfrom India and had given up\nits control over Palestine\nvoluntarily, this was not the\nuniversal pattern. Reluctance\nto abandon colonies was\nespecially a problem in\nAfrica, where there were\nBritish settlers rather than\nadministrators. By the early\ntwentieth century, 30,000\nBritish settlers occupied all\nthe best farmland in Kenya,\nwhich they had bought or had\nKenyan President Jomo Kenyatta, 1966.\nbeen assigned by the colonial\ngovernment, leaving 5 million Kenyans without. The settlers\nwere people something like the Dane Isek Dinesen, who wrote\nof her experiences in Kenya in her 1937 book Out of Africa,\nalthough most were generally less respectful and interested in\nthe natives than she. More were like farmer Mike Blundell, a 456 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwhite man featured in a Life Magazine article who had arrived\nas an unskilled farm apprentice but because he was white had\nmanaged to get hold of 1200 acres of \u201cvirgin bush.\u201d Blundell\ndespised the local Kikuyu tribes and believed the \u201cKukes\u201d as he\ncalled them had only \u201ccome out of the trees\u201d in the last 50 years,\nand probably as a result of contact with the whites. The attitude\nof British farmers in Kenya was much like the relationship two\ncenturies earlier between English colonists in North America\nand the Native Americans.\nBut this was the twentieth, not the eighteenth century. In\nKenya, a resistance movement called Mau Mau began in 1952\nwhen natives restricted to reservations in their own country\nrevolted. After World War II, 1.25 million Kikuyu had 2,000\nsquare miles of marginal farmland to feed themselves while\n30,000 British settlers had 12,000 square miles in the fertile\nhills of the Central and Rift Valleys, where they grew cash crops\nlike coffee using native labor. The Mau Mau uprising protested\nthis injustice and the British colonial government responded.\nDeclaring a state of emergency, the British moved about\n450,000 Kikuyu to concentration camps and another million\nwere restricted to \u201cenclosed villages\u201d. Prisoners suspected of\nbeing Mau Mau fighters were often tortured by British troops\n(typically they were flogged to death, burned alive, or castrated).\nIn June 1957 the British attorney general of the colony wrote\nto the governor that the mistreatment of captives was\n\u201cdistressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or\nCommunist Russia.\u201d He reminded the governor, \u201cif we are going\nto sin, we must sin quietly.\u201d Modern World History 457\nTroops of the King\u2019s African Rifles, supporting the white settler government during the\nMau Mau Uprising, ca. 1953.\nThe uprising lasted until 1963, partly because white settlers\ncould not easily abandon their property and go back to Britain.\nPower in Kenya eventually shifted from the British colonial\ngovernment to a native government, initially made up of many\nmembers of the Kenyan African National Union (KANU) that\nhad led the resistance. Its leader, Jomo Kenyatta, became\nKenya\u2019s first indigenous Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964 and\nwas President of Kenya and led the KANU party until his death\nin 1978. Kenyatta, like other leaders such as Gandhi and Ho\nChi Minh, had travelled internationally. He attended the\nCommunist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow as\nwell as University College in London and the London School\nof Economics, although when the press mentioned him, they\ntypically observed he had \u201cstudied in Russia\u201d. Kenyatta was\nimprisoned from 1954 to 1961 for allegedly leading the\nrebellion, and became leader of the party and the nation when\nreleased. Kenyatta initially tried to heal the nation by\ndownplaying the atrocity of the recent war, and he welcomed\nthe multinational corporations that dominated the Kenyan\neconomy. The government helped African farmers buy out 458 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwhite landowners and expanded education and social support\nprograms. Kenyatta was often accused of being a socialist, but\nhe was also hated by the British settlers for being married to\na white woman. His economic policies balanced capitalism and\nsocial welfare. Kenyatta was regarded by many Africans as a\nstrong Pan-Africanist and was hailed as the Hero of the Kikuyu.\nThe current (2020) president of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, is his\nson.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why might it be significant that revolutionaries like Kenyatta,\nHo, and Gandhi were world travelers?\n\u201cFrench\u201d Algeria\nThe British were not the only Europeans to lose their colonial\nempires. Although France had been conquered and occupied by\nGermany, after the war the French fully expected to regain their\ncolonial possessions in Africa and Asia and resume where they\nhad left off. Their subject peoples in the colonies had different\nideas. In Algeria, revolutionaries had been organizing to resist\nFrench imperialism since before the war. An Algerian People\u2019s\nManifesto was published in 1943. On the morning of May 8,\n1945, (the day that Nazi Germany surrendered, or VE Day), a\nparade of about 5,000 Muslim Algerians celebrating the war\u2019s\nend was met by armed French police. Marchers and police\nexchanged gunfire and during the battle people on both sides\nwere shot. A few days later a smaller, peaceful protest by the\nAlgerian People\u2019s Party was violently repressed by police. Rural\nAlgerians responded by attacking ethnic French settlers, called\npieds noirs, killing 102 Europeans. The French retaliated, killing\nbetween 6,000 and 30,000 Algerians.

The\nNational Liberation Front (FLN), encouraged by the fact France\nhad just lost their colony of French Indochina, called on\nMuslims in Algeria to join in the struggle for independence. The\nFLN applied guerrilla \u201chit and run\u201d tactics as well as terrorism\nand torture of both French pieds noirs and Africans suspected of\nsupporting the regime. The French were equally brutal, and by\n1956 there were more than 400,000 French troops in Algeria.\nBarricades in Algiers, January 1960. The banner reads, \u201cLong live Massu\u201d (Vive Massu).\nThe war lasted eight years and killed over a million people. The\nFrench military lost 25,000 troops and about 3,000 European\ncivilians were killed. French officials estimated the Algerian\ndeath toll at 350,000, but other French and Algerian estimates 460 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nrange from 960,000 to 1.5 million. The United States\nrecognized Algeria\u2019s independence in September 1962 and the\ncountry became the 109th member of the U.N. in October.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How might the scope of European retaliation, killing about\nten Africans for every European killed, have effected world\npublic opinion?\n\u201cFrench\u201d Indochina\nFrance had also expected to\nreturn to power in its colonies\nin French Indochina\n(Vietnam, Laos, and\nCambodia), but the people\nliving there also had other\nideas. Revolutionaries were\nled by Ho Chi Minh\n(1890-1969), who as a young\nman had worked as a kitchen\nhelper on a steamship from\nSaigon to Marseille in 1911.\nHo actually applied to the\nFrench Colonial\nAdministrative School in\nMarseille, but his application\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh also known as Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i\nwas rejected and he returned\nQu\u1ed1c, about 1947.\nto working on ships and\ntraveling the world for another five years (it\u2019s interesting to\nimagine how history would have been different if he had been\naccepted). He visited the U.S. several times in his travels and\nlater claimed to have met Black nationalist Marcus Garvey. Ho\nworked in England and France between 1913 and 1919. He Modern World History 461\njoined a group of Vietnamese nationalists in Paris, and at the\nend of World War I, the group petitioned at the Versailles peace\ntalks for recognition of the civil rights of Vietnamese people,\nciting Woodrow Wilson\u2019s statements about self-determination\nin the famous \u201c14 Points\u201d speech. Ho wrote a letter to Wilson,\nbut the American President ignored him.\nRebuffed, Ho continued living in France in the early 1920s,\nmeeting socialists and becoming a founding member of the\nFrench Communist Party. Ho began to write articles that were\nnoticed in Moscow and he was invited to visit the Soviet Union.\nIn 1923, Ho studied at the Communist University of the Toilers\nof the East in Moscow before moving to Guangzhou China in\n1924. When Chiang Kai-shek cracked down on communists in\nChina, Ho returned to Moscow and then moved on to Thailand.\nIn late 1929 he moved through India to Shanghai and Hong\nKong. By this time, he was becoming well-known in\nrevolutionary circles. Ho was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931 but\nescaped and returned to Russia.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (third from left, standing) with the OSS in 1945.\nIn 1938 Ho returned to China as an advisor to the Chinese\nCommunist army. In 1941 he returned to Vietnam to lead the\nindependence movement there. The Japanese invasion created\nan opportunity for the patriots, who were aided in their 462 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nresistance of the Japanese and Vichy French by the U.S. Office of\nStrategic Services (OSS), the predecessor of the CIA. At the end\nof World War II, Ho wrote a declaration of independence for\nVietnam based on the US Declaration from 1776. Ho repeatedly\npetitioned President Harry S. Truman to recognize Vietnam,\nciting the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.\nMeanwhile, British and Chinese troops occupied the country in\nsupport of France. Vietnamese rioted and killed a hundred or\nso French citizens, and in retaliation French troops armed\nJapanese prisoners of war and massacred over 6,000\nVietnamese. This was the same pattern of asymmetrical force\nused by empires against their subjects throughout the colonial\nperiod. However, the story of Vietnam is only half over; we will\nreturn to it in the next chapter when we discuss the Cold War.\nKenya, Algeria, and Vietnam were not the only places where\nthe imperial powers and their international allies responded\nviolently to movements of national liberation among the\ncolonized. For example, the French killed 80,000 in\nMadagascar in 1947 when the people of that island supported\nindependence. The Indonesian War of Independence raged\nfrom the former Dutch East Indies declaration of independence\nin 1945 and The Netherlands\u2019 recognition of their claims in\n1949. About 8,000 Dutch troops and their allies were killed, and\nabout 100,000 Indonesians. And growing fears of international\ncommunism pushed the United States government into\nsupporting some of these actions. Although the Americans had\npeacefully let go of the Philippines, the U.S. military helped\nKorean militias massacre about 60,000 members of a peasant\ninsurgency. The Korean Peninsula had been divided at the end\nof World War Two, like Germany, into Soviet and U.S.\noccupation zones. Unsurprisingly, the two rivals backed\ncommunist and non-communist leaders in North and South\nKorea. The resulting conflict, the Korean War (1950-1953), will\nbe examined in more detail in the next chapter on the Cold War.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 463\n\u2022 Is it significant that Ho Chi Minh worked with the OSS during\nWorld War II when he was opposing Japan?\n\u2022 How many chances were there in Ho\u2019s story, where history\ncould have turned out differently?\nNew Nations and Development\nThe newly-founded countries in Africa and Asia all faced the\nchallenges of establishing borders, forming new governments,\nbuilding economic self-reliance, controlling natural resources,\nand working toward a more just and equitable society. In\nprevious chapters, we have seen how the new nations in Latin\nAmerica had confronted similar issues since the early\nnineteenth century. Other older but less-industrialized\ncountries, like Iran, also addressed questions of development\nand national sovereignty.\nPahalgam Valley, Kashmir.\nOne of the major challenges faced by these new nations was\nthe problem of borders. The administrative boundaries drawn\nby the European imperial powers did not always follow any\nlogic that served the colonized peoples. We have seen that 464 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndisagreements over Kashmir continue to cause tensions\nbetween India and its neighbor Pakistan, which are further\ncomplicated by the fact that both India and Pakistan are now\nnuclear powers (India since 1974 and Pakistan since 1999). India\nalso supported the independence of East Pakistan (now\nBangladesh) in the early 1970s, a conflict which brought famine\nand death to hundreds of thousands in the same region that had\nbeen starved out thirty years before during World War II.\nSub-Saharan Africa\u2019s\ndivision by the European\npowers had also haphazardly\nthrown together peoples who\nwanted separate nations.\nViolent conflicts based on\ntribal loyalties have caused\ncivil wars and political\ninstability. For instance, when\nthe Igbo people tried to form\na separate nation in Nigeria in\n1965, the three-year civil war\nthat followed killed thousands\nbefore Biafra was defeated.\nThe disputed region is\npetroleum-rich (Nigeria leads\nAfrica in oil production); so\nthat even today, Igbo\nFrench journalist Gilles Caron photographs\nthe starving children of Biafra during the separatists harass the\nNigerian Civil War, 1969. Nigerian government,\nresentful that their oil wealth\nseems to benefit the rest of the country more than it serves\nthem.\nSuch conflicts do not only result in separatist civil wars.\nAlthough no tribe advocates establishing their own independent\nstate in Kenya, conflicting tribal loyalties often spill over into\npolitical competition. Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta tended to\nfavor his Kikuyu people, who were a plurality but not a majority\nin Kenya, during his long presidency. Resentment by the Luo\nand Kalenjin people led to realignments of political parties, Modern World History 465\nwhich caused widespread violence after a contested election in\n2008, with the death of hundreds.\nNearly all of the new nations embraced democratic\nconstitutions. But it is one thing to write a constitution, and\nquite another to actually follow it. Like the older republics in\nLatin America, many new nations suffered through periods of\nauthoritarian rule. Often, the military would step in and\noverthrow a democratically-elected government in times of\nperceived or actual economic or political chaos. The colonial\npowers had trained militaries as well as educating local\nadministrators; army officers often felt that they were in a better\nposition to rule their countries than incompetent and corrupt\npoliticians, even if they had been elected democratically.\nSimilar arguments had been made by fascists and\nauthoritarians in interwar Europe; the mistakes of the\nimperialists were often repeated in their former colonies. The\nCold War complicated this situation, as fear of communist-led\n\u201cwars of national liberation\u201d frequently caused the United States\nand other Western \u201cdemocracies\u201d to support repressive military\ndictatorships. 466 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAgain, the example of India\nand Pakistan illustrates the\nproblem of political stability\nin the new nations. India\nsuccessfully embraced\ndemocracy and remains\ntoday the largest democracy\nby population. One reason\nfor this was the popularity of\nthe Congress Party, which\ndominated Indian politics\nuntil the 1990s. Another is the\nprominence of the Nehru\nfamily: after Indian Prime\nMinster Jawaharlal Nehru\ndied of natural causes in 1964,\nhe was succeeded by his\ndaughter Indira Gandhi (no\nrelation to Mahatma Gandhi)\nfor twenty years, and she was Indira Gandhi with her father, Jawaharlal\nNehru, and her sons Rajiv Gandhi and\nfollowed by her son Rajiv\nSanjay Gandhi. Nehru, Indira, and Rajiv\nGandhi. Their dedication to were Prime Ministers, Sanjay was a\ndemocratic traditions Congress Party Member of Parliament until\nhe died in a private plane crash in 1980.\nbrought a degree of political\nstability, although India was not free of problems that beset\nother new nations. Sikhs advocating for more power in Hindu\nIndia murdered Indira Gandhi in 1984 and ethnic Tamil\nseparatists assassinated her son Rajiv in 1991. Despite these\nshocks, elections continued, and even opposition parties have\ntaken the reins of government peacefully from the Congress\nParty since the 1990s; including current Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi, elected in 2014.\nOn the other hand, Pakistan has been ruled by their military\nmore often than not since independence. Unlike in Nehru\u2019s\nIndia, Pakistan did not benefit from an initial long premiership\nby its founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who died barely\na year after independence of tuberculosis and lung cancer.\nInternal and international crises led to repeated interventions\nby the Pakistani military into national government. The 2013 Modern World History 467\nPakistani elections were the first time one democratically\nelected government peacefully replaced another. But even\ntoday the military plays an independent, often secretive role in\nPakistan, especially in foreign policy.\nAll of the new nations were faced with the question of how\nto develop their economies. Some governments were inspired\nby the apparent rapid industrial growth in the Soviet Union\nunder Stalin\u2019s Five-Year Plans, while others embraced the role\nof providing natural resources to the mature industrial\neconomies of the West. Independent economic self-reliance\nwas often difficult to achieve when industries and public utilities\nremained foreign-owned. Some new governments nationalized\nthese businesses, so that the nation owned and operated them\nin the name of the people rather than for the profits of foreign\nshareholders. In India, for example, Nehru\u2019s government\nnationalized the railroads, electric utilities, and communication\nsystems. Seeing the results of India\u2019s actions, many new African\nand Asian countries did the same.\nCritics of nationalized industries argued that like the\ncollectivized agriculture and industry of the Soviet Union, these\nbusinesses faced no competition. Their objections were taken\nseriously, partly because Stalin\u2019s lies about the success of the\nFive Year Plans were finally discovered, and partly because\nnationalized industries often became inefficient as positions in\na railroad or a telephone company transformed into political\nplums: no-show jobs awarded to loyal supporters. The foreign\nbusinesses that had been pushed out supported this view, and\na reaction to nationalization, privatization, began in the 1980s.\nIn India the push for privatization was led by Rajiv Gandhi, the\ngrandson of the leader who had led nationalization efforts. In\nprivatization, government-run industries were sold back to the\nprivate sector, which on occasion included, once again, foreign\ninvestors. Newly-privatized industries often initially embraced\ncost-cutting efficiencies and more competent management,\nrepairing broken-down electrical grids and rail lines. However,\nas profits were once again exported abroad or held by a tiny\nlocal elite, there has been a push back against privatization,\nas some leaders once again seek more benefits for the entire\nnation. 468 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did Stalin\u2019s lies about the success of the Five Year Plans\naffect the decisions of newly decolonized nations?\n\u2022 In what ways did the problems of borders and religious\ndifferences continue to plague the new nations?\nThe Mount Washington Hotel, in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.\nIn recent decades, a leader in the political push for privatization\nhas been the International Monetary Fund (IMF), first\nestablished at the July 1944 conference at the Mount\nWashington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire\nmentioned earlier. Even before the war ended, forty-four allied\nnations sent 730 delegates to establish what would become a\nglobal system for regulating international balances of\ncommercial payments and securing what they hoped would\nbe financial stability for the post-war world. Initially, they were Modern World History 469\nmainly thinking of creating institutions and policies that would\nboth rebuild war-torn Europe and Asia and prevent the\nhyperinflation and Great Depression that led to so much\ninstability between the wars.\nThere were two architects\nof the meeting and the global\nfinancial plan that came from\nit. John Maynard Keynes was\nthe British economist who\nhad pioneered the \u201cdemand-\nside\u201d economic theory that\npeople like U.S. President\nFranklin Roosevelt had\nadopted to confront the Great\nDepression. Keynes\u2019 claim\nwas that by spending money,\nthe federal government could\njump-start the economy,\ncreate jobs, and put the\nHarry Dexter White (left) and John Maynard\nKeynes (right) at Bretton Woods, 1944. money in people\u2019s pockets\nthat would enable them to\nbuy consumer products. This plan was temporarily derailed by\nwar production and rationing, so it is unclear to many\neconomists that Keynes was right and that deficit spending and\ngovernment borrowing was the key to ending the Depression.\nAt the time of the Bretton Woods Conference, Keynes was the\nchief advisor to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain. The\nAmerican, Harry Dexter White, worked closely with Treasury\nSecretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. White dominated the\nconference and although he considered himself a Keynesian,\nhe vetoed Keynes\u2019s proposal for the International Clearing\nUnion (ICU), a central bank with its own currency, the\n\u201cbancor\u201d. White opposed the ICU and instead proposed an\nInternational Stabilization Fund that would help debtor nations\nmaintain their balance of trade. This grew into the International\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (IRBD), which\nbecame the World Bank. The U.S.\u2019s goal was to promote\ninternational development but also to help establish markets for 470 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAmerican manufactures, now that the war effort had greatly\nincreased U.S. manufacturing capacity.\nAnother reason the U.S. rejected the ICU and the \u201cbancor\u201d\nwas to protect the leading position of the dollar in the world\neconomy. Since the U.S. had the strongest economy in the world\nat the end of the World War II, they also dictated the trade\nprovisions agreed to at the conference. The major provisions\nof the agreement were a foreign exchange system with the U.S.\nDollar as its base currency, along with a pledge by members\nto convert their currency to gold for trade-related\ndemands. Countries were required to adopt the gold standard\nand were not allowed to alter their currency\u2019s exchange rate\nby more than 10%. This would prevent debtor nations from\nescaping their obligations to creditors by simply inflating their\ncurrencies. Finally, all members had to pitch in to the new\nbank\u2019s assets, although the U.S. put up most of the money.\nBretton Woods also drafted a set of trade-related\nrecommendations and an International Trade Organization\n(ITO) was proposed, with a goal of reducing tariffs. The United\nStates Senate, however, was not interested in ceding its\nauthority over tariffs to a new international organization, and\ndid not ratify the ITO\u2019s charter. The less aggressive General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was adopted in its\nplace. We will discuss it when we cover Globalization. Modern World History 471\nBretton Woods created the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\nwhich lends money to distressed economies suffering from\nhyperinflation or other financial chaos and, as a condition for\ncredit, stipulates how a borrower country should reorganize\ngovernment spending and finance. The IMF was designed to\noversee the international monetary and financial systems and to\nmonitor member nations. The U.S. undermined this mission\nwhen it went off the gold standard in 1971. Inflationary\ngovernment spending on both the war in Viet Nam and the War\non Poverty begun by Lyndon Johnson, and a worsening balance\nof trade led the Nixon administration to fear that foreign\nholders of dollars would demand conversion to gold, which\nwould rapidly wipe out the U.S. gold reserves, held in Federal\nBullion Depositories such as Fort Knox. Nixon\u2019s unilateral\ndecision was ratified by Congress in 1978. By the end of the\n1970s, no major currency was convertible for gold. Although\nthe dollar is no longer redeemable in gold, the United States 472 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ncontinues to maintain a gold reserve of over 8.1 metric tons ,\nmore than half of it stored at Fort Knox in Kentucky. The next\nlargest national gold reserve, roughly 3.3 metric tons, belongs to\nGermany\nLosing their original reasons for existence, the IMF and World\nBank were forced to adapt. Rather than enforcing convertibility,\nthe IMF began using its ability to loan interest-free\ndevelopment money to debtor nations as a way to intervene in\nand direct the economic policies of the borrowers. The IMF\u2019s\nstated aim was to avoid or mitigate financial crises, using the\n\u201cconditionality\u201d of their loans. The IMF now analyses nations\u2019\neconomic policies and offers \u201cadvice\u201d which must be taken in\norder to receive IMF loans.\nThe changes the IMF and the World Bank require are called\nStructural Adjustment Programs. They typically include\nderegulation, privatization, and removal of trade barriers. All of\nthese measures have been criticized by debtor nations as being\nmore beneficial for the lenders in developed industrialized\nnations rather than for borrowers in the developing world.\nOther structural adjustments can include reducing trade deficits\nthrough currency devaluation, austerity programs to decrease\nbudget deficits, eliminating social welfare programs, cutting\npublic services, focusing economic output on resource\nextraction, and attracting foreign direct investment. This\ncurrent bundle of structural adjustment programs is known as\nthe Washington Consensus and is associated with neoliberalism\nor market fundamentalism, which we will discuss in a later\nchapter. Even in its more modest formulation, IMF policy is\ndesigned to liberalize trade, deregulate and privatize industries,\nand protect property rights above all other concerns.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What do you think the response of the communist U.S.S.R.\nmay have been to the Bretton Woods Conference and the\nIMF?\n\u2022 Is it possible to interpret the IMF\u2019s role as global lender as a Modern World History 473\ncontinuation of a new, economic form of imperialism?\nThe Green Revolution\nThe explosive improvement of agricultural yields throughout\nthe world known as the Green Revolution began in the 1960s\nin a research station on the edge of the Mexican desert. The\nscientist most associated with these advances is Norman\nBorlaug, an agronomist who developed a disease-resistant strain\nor dwarf wheat that increased yields of the grain worldwide,\nespecially in developing nations facing high population growth\nand threat of famine. Borlaug (1914-2009) grew up on a 106-acre\nIowa farm and attended the University of Minnesota in the\n1930s. Borlaug\u2019s education included a stint in the Civilian\nConservation Corps during the Great Depression. He later\nremembered that seeing the effect of hunger on people in\nAmerica \u201cleft scars\u201d on him and motivated him to try to solve\nthe problems of supplying food to a growing world population.\nBorlaug continued at the U of M after graduation, eventually\nearning a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942. Borlaug\nthen went to work as a microbiologist at DuPont. After a couple\nof years with DuPont, he joined the Cooperative Wheat\nResearch Production Program, a joint venture of the Rockefeller\nFoundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture. 474 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBorlaug\u2019s hybrid wheat.\nBorlaug found that local Mexican farmers resisted planting\nwheat because a fungus called stem rust reduced their yields\nso much they couldn\u2019t make a living. A related problem with\nwheat farming in Mexico was that the plants grew too tall when\nheavily fertilized and then \u201clodged\u201d or fell over prior to harvest.\nBorlaug and his team bred a new strain of dwarf wheat that\nwould not grow too tall when fertilized and that also resisted\nrust. The process took ten years and over 6,000 cross-breeding\nexperiments between different types of wheat. The new wheat\nhad the additional advantage of being able to be planted twice\nper year. Although it took Borlaug a while to convince local\nfarmers to try his new hybrid, they could see his fields and\nwere finally convinced. Between 1950 and 2000, Mexican wheat\nyields increased between 400% and 500%.\nIn the 1960s, as the program was becoming successful in\nMexico, it was exported to India, which was facing\nfamine. American farmers shipped a fifth of their wheat\nproduction to India in 1966 and 1967. The Indian situation\nseemed dire, especially since India\u2019s population crossed the\n500-million mark in 1966 and was expected to grow by another\n200 million by 1980. The prediction was accurate: India crossed Modern World History 475\n700 million in the early months of 1981, on its way to a current\nlevel of 1.38 billion. India imported 18,000 tons of Borlaug\u2019s\nseed wheat in 1966. Wheat yields increased from 12.3 million\ntons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970. By 1974 India was\nself-sufficient in all cereal grains and the USAID (US Agency\nfor International Development) began calling Borlaug\u2019s work a\nGreen Revolution. Since the 1960s India\u2019s food production has\nincreased faster than population growth. By 2000 India was\nproducing 76.4 million tons of wheat.\nWheat yields have more than doubled in the least developed countries since 1961.\nIndia\u2019s improved crop yields, driven by Borlaug\u2019s improved\nwheat, have made it a net exported of wheat. India began\nexporting wheat regularly in the 1970s and since 1980 has\nexported wheat every year except three. The nation\u2019s\nexceptional agricultural turnaround was made possible by\nBorlaug\u2019s new wheat, but also by extensive use of fertilizer,\nirrigation, and machinery. The improved crop and techniques\nhave prevented up to 100 million acres of virgin land from\nbeing converted to farmland. This savings amounts to 13.6% of\nIndia\u2019s land, or about the area of California. Borlaug predicted 476 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthat as world population continued to rise, only new crops and\nimproved farming techniques would save the world\u2019s remaining\nforests and uncultivated lands.\nAlthough the Green\nRevolution has undoubtedly\nsaved lives and allowed\npopulations in India to\nincrease dramatically,\nBorlaug and the Green\nRevolution have been\ncriticized for bringing capital-\nand energy-intensive western\nagricultural techniques to\nregions of the world that had\nonce relied on subsistence\nfarming. Western-style\nfarming tends to reward\nlarge-scale operators and\noften provides even greater\nrewards to manufacturers of\nDr. Vandana Shiva agrochemicals and\nmachinery. Widening social\ninequality and expanding farmer debt has led to issues like the\nsuicide crisis of India, where hundreds of thousands of indebted\nfarmers have killed themselves after becoming dependent on\nhybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and the\nmachinery needed to produce crops at the scale required by the\nnew economics of agriculture. Activists like Vandana Shiva have\nargued that 80% of the world\u2019s population is actually fed by the\nproduce of subsistence farmers rather than the industrialized\nagriculture highlighted in the Green Revolution. If this is true,\nthen maybe the claims of the \u201crevolution\u201d are overblown.\nShiva also claims that the data she has compiled show that the\nnumber one factor in the rapid improvement of yields in India\nhas been increased wwaatteerr uussee, not fertilizers or Borlaug\u2019s \u201cmiracle\nseed\u201d. Shiva says this increased irrigation is unsustainable, and\ncites studies showing a rapidly sinking water table across much\nof India. She further charges that by using language like Modern World History 477\n\u201cmiracle seed\u201d, the Green Revolution has become more a\nmythology than a scientific, data-driven reality.\nShiva is also an important\nactivist against Genetically\nModified Organisms (GMOs)\nwho appears regularly on\nstage giving speeches and\nTED talks, or on television as\nan anti-GMO\nspokesperson. Although\nBorlaug\u2019s dwarf wheat was President George W. Bush along with\nnot produced by the types of House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi congratulate\ngenetic manipulations\nBorlaug during the Congressional Gold\ncurrently used to produce Medal Ceremony on July 17, 2007.\nGMO crops, some people still\nresent it as a human intrusion on nature\u2019s processes. Borlaug,\nfor his part, has stubbornly refused to believe there is a rational\nargument against the \u201cmiracle\u201d he helped bring about. He\nreceived a Nobel Peace Prize, a Congressional Gold Medal, and\na Presidential Medal of Freedom. Toward the end of his life he\ncriticized people who questioned the Green Revolution as\nelitists who had never gone hungry, but he also admitted that\nalthough his contribution had helped save many lives, it had not\ncreated a Utopia.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 What were the pros and cons of the Green Revolution? 478 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 American_military_personnel_gather_in_Paris_to_ce\nlebrate_the_Japanese_surrender \u00a9 Office of the Chief\nSignal Officer is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Winston_Churchill_waves_to_crowds_in_Whitehall_i\nn_London_as_they_celebrate_VE_Day,_8_May_1945.\n_H41849 \u00a9 Major W.

A defining element of the Cold War was that\nit did not become a hot war. Neither the U.S. not the U.S.S.R.\nlaunched attacks on the territories of the other. Instead, the\nsuperpowers supported or intervened in the conflicts of nations\nin their spheres of influence. To a great extent, the Cold War was\na struggle by each superpower to extend its sphere of influence\nand block the other from doing the same. The Soviets and the\nAmericans justified their actions in a variety of ways. Creating\na buffer-zone to protect the homeland. Defending like-minded\ngovernments against a different political or economic\nphilosophy. One side said it was protecting the world from\nthe threat of totalitarian communist imperialism and the other\nsaid it was protecting the world from imperialist capitalism.\nInterestingly, both accused their antagonist of being an empire.\n480 Modern World History 481\nEuropean military alliances during the Cold War\nWorld War Two in Europe was nearly over when Stalin,\nalta in February\nRoosevelt, and Churchill met at Y\n1945, but the war in the Pacific was still\nongoing. This fact weighed heavily on\nthe British and Americans, who were\nhoping for Soviet help in defeating\nJapan. Stalin had signed a Non-\nAgression Pact with the Japanese in\n1941, which both sides maintained\nduring the conflict; at Yalta, he pledged\nto declare war on Japan three months\nafter the German surrender. In\nexchange, Roosevelt and Churchill 482 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nessentially agreed to the Soviet\nmilitary occupation of Eastern\nEurope. It would turn out that this\nwould be the beginning of the Cold\nWar between the U.S. and the Soviet\nUnion, which would not be fought\ndirectly between the two superpowers,\nbut rather through proxy wars in the\ndeveloping world over most of the\nnext five decades.\nWorld War II in Europe was\nnearly over when Stalin,\nRoosevelt, and Churchill met\nat Yalta in February 1945, but\nthe war in the Pacific was still\nunresolved. Stalin had signed\na Non-Aggression Pact with\nJapan in 1941 which both sides\nhad maintained during the\nconflict. Roosevelt and\nChurchill urged Stalin to join\nthem in defeating Germany\u2019s\nfinal Axis partner. Stalin\nagreed to declare war on\nJapan three months after the\nGerman surrender. In\nOccupation zone borders in Germany, and\nthe four zones of Berlin, 1947. exchange, Roosevelt and\nChurchill essentially agreed\nto accept the Soviet military occupation of eastern Europe. The\nAllies were interested in winning the Second World War, but\nwere all aware that they were not natural allies in the long run.\nAfter the war\u2019s end, Eastern Europe and Asia would both be\nareas of contention between the U.S.S.R. and the \u201cWest\u201d.\nDespite promised democratic elections, by 1949 the Soviets\nhad set up one-party communist states mirroring their own\nin Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Modern World History 483\nStalin\u2019s desire to dominate eastern Europe as a buffer zone\nagainst attacks from the West was understandable, given the\nhistory of European wars and the tremendous sacrifices of\nblood and treasure by the Soviets during the war that had just\nended. Stalin also decided to retain the Polish territory first\ntaken by his armies in 1939 when he had been Hitler\u2019s ally\nand advocated pushing the borders of Poland farther west and\nsouth into what had been Germany in 1939. And the Baltic states\nthe Red Army had conquered in 1939-1940 while Hitler was\nattacking France also remained part of the Soviet Union.\nThe first Cold War challenge to post-\nwar peace occurred in Greece, where\ncommunist and non-communist anti-\nNazi partisans began fighting for\ncontrol shortly after the Germans\nwithdrew from their country in late\n1944. When the war ended, this\nconflict soon turned into a full-blown\ncivil war. However, Greece was outside\nof the Stalin\u2019s sphere of influence. The\nBritish and Americans began\nsupporting the beleaguered\nparliamentary monarchy against the\ncommunists, who were defeated in\n1947. The conflict in Greece showcased\nthe new \u201cTruman Doctrine\u201d of\ncontainment, under which the U.S. was\nwilling to concede to Soviet\ndomination of Eastern Europe, but\nwould \u201ccontain\u201d the spread of\ncommunist regimes in any other\ncountry. 484 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.\nYou can view it online here: https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/\nmodernworldhistory/?p=81\nIn 1946, former Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited\nPresident Harry Truman in his home state of Missouri and\nmade a speech at Westminster College. Churchill said the\nsituation in Europe felt as if Stalin had dropped an \u201ciron\ncurtain\u201d separating East from West. It was an apt description:\nneither the Soviets nor the new communist regimes permitted\nfree travel between the two sides. The division of. Europe into\nEast and West was complicated by the Allied agreement to\noccupy defeated Germany in four sectors: U.S., British, French,\nand Soviet. The German capital Berlin was also divided into\nquarters by the four former allies, even though it was\nsurrounded by Soviet-occupied East Germany. The division of\nGermany was completed when the western portion uniting in\na federal republic, the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (GDR), in\nOctober 1949, complete with elections and multiple political\nparties. At the same time, East Germany became the Deutsche\nDemokratische Republik (DDR), a one-party communist satellite\nstate of the Soviet Union. I remember as a child being confused Modern World History 485\nwhen I listened to the news, why America was enemies with a\nnation that had Democratic in its name.\nAlthough the United States\nand the Soviet Union had\nbeen allies in World War II,\nthe relationship did not last\nlong after the defeat of\nGermany and Japan. In\nFebruary 1946, less than a\nyear after the end of the war,\nthe head of the U.S. embassy\nin Moscow, George Kennan,\nsent a message that became\nknown as the long telegram to\nthe State Department\nThe Iron Curtain in black, with a black dot\nrepresenting West Berlin.

Instead, the Soviets had to 486 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nbe \u201ccontained.\u201d As the Russians had advanced toward Germany\nin the final years of World War II, they had not only retaken\nRussian territory but had held onto the lands Stalin had\nconquered when he was Hitler\u2019s ally and expanded their control\nover Eastern Europe. In the years after the war the U.S.S.R.\ncontrolled not only East Germany but newly formed People\u2019s\nRepublics of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania,\nBulgaria, and Albania. In the alarm caused by the creation of\nthese satellite states, often ruled by Soviet-installed dictators,\nanti-Soviet sentiment seized the American government and\nsoon the American people.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why were Western leaders so concerned about the threat of\nCommunism?\n\u2022 What do you think motivated the Soviets to try to expand\ntheir sphere of influence?\n\u2022 Was the West\u2019s motivation different?\nTo try to prevent a drift\ntoward socialism in nations\nstruggling with food\nshortages and rebuilding\nfrom the destruction of the\nwar, the United States\nlaunched the Marshall Plan in\n1948 to rebuild western\nEurope. The Soviets During the winter of 1947, thousands\nresponded to the $15 billion protest in West Germany against the\ndisastrous food situation. The sign says,\naid program with an order\n\u201cWe want coal, we want bread.\u201d\nthat their satellite nations\nreject it, because the financial assistance came with the\ncondition of economic cooperation that Stalin worried would\nmake small nations like Yugoslavia dependent on western Modern World History 487\ncorporations. The United States was anxious to rebuild Europe\nas quickly as possible, no only to reopen markets for U.S. goods,\nbut also to counter the influence of growing communist parties\nin Italy, France, and other Western European countries. U.S.\nSecretary of State George C. Marshall shipped food and other\nmaterial aid, and provided financial support to any European\ncountry who requested it. The result was the largely capitalist\nrebuilding of Western Europe and West Germany, while Eastern\nEurope began industrializing by following Soviet-inspired Five-\nYear Plans.\nEuropean\nnations entered new military alliances along East-West lines as\nwell. In April 1949, Great Britain, France, and other Western\nEuropean Allies united with the U.S. and Canada in a military\nalliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\npledging to defend one another in case of attack. NATO became\nalarmingly relevant later that summer when the Soviets\ndetonated their first atomic bomb, breaking the U.S. monopoly\non nuclear weapons. In the ensuing decades, both superpowers\nwould develop advanced missiles, air forces, and submarines\nto deliver an overwhelming nuclear attack on the other side\u2019s\nhomeland in case of war. The superpowers adopted a policy\nof \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d as a means of preventing a\nconflict which would almost certainly have destroyed most of\nthe humans and probably much of life on the planet. Britain was 488 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nnext to join the nuclear club in 1952, followed by France in 1960,\nChina in 1964, India in 1974, Pakistan in 1998, and North Korea\nin 2006. Israel developed weapons in secret in the 1960s, and\nSouth Africa developed a couple of weapons in the 1970s but\nscrapped them and joined the non-proliferation movement by\n1991, at the same time the De Klerk government was freeing\nNelson Mandela and beginning to end apartheid. Also in 1991\nKazakhstan left the Soviet Union and inherited a nuclear arsenal\nlarger than that of Britain and France, but became the first\nnation to scrap its nuclear arsenal. We will return to both these\nevents later in the chapter.\nOperation Castle series of U.S. tests of thermonuclear weapons (H-bombs) in the\nMarshall Islands. Modern World History 489\n1949 ended with a new challenge in East Asia, when\ncommunist forces led by Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist\narmies of Chiang Kai-Shek and established the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, which we will turn to shortly.\nStalin died in 1953 and after\na power struggle in the\nPolitburo a new Premier,\nNikita Khrushchev, took\npower in Moscow.\nKhrushchev distanced\nhimself from what he called\nStalin\u2019s \u201ccult of personality\u201d\nand revealed the extent of\nStalin\u2019s atrocities against\nperceived political enemies,\nwhich had led to the deaths of\nmillions in purges, forced\nlabor, and famine in the\nprevious decades.\nKhrushchev announced a\nNikita Khrushchev, Time Magazine\u2019s Man of\nnew Soviet foreign policy of\nthe Year for 1957\n\u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d with\nthe West, pledging not to extend communism by invading other\ncountries but creating a military alliance, the Warsaw Pact,\nwithin the Soviet Bloc in Europe to counterbalance NATO.\nKhrushchev wanted Soviet communism to provide a higher\nstandard of living for workers. Achieving this was difficult if the\nmilitary budget was too large, so he sought to lessen tensions\nwith the U.S. and its allies. But there were limits to Khrushchev\u2019s\nemocratic reforms in\n\u201cliberalism\u201d. In 1956, d\nHungary led to a possibility of\nspreading anti-Soviet dissent in\nneighboring communist countries\nunder Moscow\u2019s control. The Soviets\nand their Warsaw Pact satellite\ncountries sent troops and tanks to 490 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nrepress any political changes in\nHungary and Eastern Europe.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Do you think mutual assured destruction was a reasonable\nstrategy?\n\u2022 When you review the list of members of the \u201cnuclear club\u201d,\nare there any countries on it you weren\u2019t expecting to see?\nThe Cold War in Asia\nAlthough the U.S.S.R. had\nhelped end the Pacific War by\ninvading Manchuria in\nAugust 1945, the subsequent\nreconstruction of Japan was\nstrictly a U.S. affair. By the\ntime the military occupation\nended in 1955, Japan had\nreturned to rule by a\ndemocratically-elected\nparliamentary monarchy\nunder the same Emperor,\nHirohito. The U.S. guaranteed\nJapan\u2019s security through a\nEmperor Hirohito and General MacArthur, treaty and a military base in\nwho led the occupation, at their first Okinawa, and provided\nmeeting at the U.S. Embassy, Tokyo,\nfinancial assistance and\nSeptember, 1945\npreferential access to U.S.\nmarkets to rebuild the Japanese economy. This was partly an\nattempt to counter the perceived communist threat in Asia, and\nJapan developed a highly successful public-private economic\nmodel, ultimately producing electronics and automobiles that\nwould dominate their sectors worldwide. Modern World History 491\nAfter World War II, the Nationalists and Communists\nrestarted their civil war, which had been interrupted in 1937\nby the Japanese invasion. Mao\u2019s armies were victorious over\nthe corrupt and incompetent Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-\nShek. By the end, entire divisions of the Nationalist army were\nChiang fled to\ngoing over to the Communists, and\nthe island of Taiwan, which had been\nrelinquished to China after being a\npart of the Japanese Empire for fifty\nyears. There, the Kuomintang\ncontinued the Republic of China,\nwhich was formally recognized as\n\u201cChina\u201d by the United Nations and the\nU.S. until the 1970s. Cold War politics\nwas the reason for this diplomatic\ndecision, but even after its end\nTaiwan\u2019s autonomy from mainland\nChina is still guaranteed by the U.S.\nAs previously mentioned, war broke out on China\u2019s border\na year after the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic. The\nKorean Peninsula had been divided like Germany at the end\nof the war with the Soviets administering the north while the\nsouth was controlled by the United States. The U.S.S.R. helped\nestablish a communist regime under Kim Il-sung, while the\nAmericans supported an authoritarian \u201cnationalist\u201d, Syngman\nRhee. In June 1950, Kim ordered the invasion of the south in\nan attempt to unite the peninsula. As Kim\u2019s forces quickly took\nmost of the south, the United Nations Security Council ordered\na military response, led by the United States. The Soviet Union\nabstained instead of using its veto power in the Security\nCouncil, casting doubt on the western suspicion that Stalin had\nokayed Kim\u2019s invasion of the south. 492 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nCombat in the streets of Seoul, 1950.\nBy October, U.S.-led United Nations forces had pushed the\ncommunist North Korean forces out of the south and had taken\nthe northern capital, Pyongyang. U.N. armies continued to\nadvance northward toward the Chinese border at the Yalu River,\nwhich brought China into the war on the North Korean side.\nOn October 25, U.N. troops were surprised by a counterattack\nby millions of soldiers from China, as Mao defended Chinese\nterritory from foreign invasion and his own new communist\ngovernment, established only a year before. U.S. commander\nDouglas MacArthur, a hero of the Pacific War in World War II\nand leader of the occupation of Japan, talked about his ambition\nto expand the conflict in Korea to a full-on war with China and\ncontemplated using nuclear weapons. Since the USSR also had\nnuclear weapons and had signed a mutual-defense treaty with\nMao\u2019s new government, a war with China was likely to escalate\ninto World War III. When the general refused to back down\nand criticized the president\u2019s judgment, Harry Truman fired\nMacArthur. Modern World History 493\nAfter three years of fighting\nand nearly 3 million Korean\ndeaths (and 54,000 U.S. GIs),\nthe two sides agreed to a\ncease-fire, but a peace treaty\nwas never concluded and the\narea has remained a\nflashpoint. North Korea has\nbecome a totalitarian closed\nsociety, largely isolated after\nthe fall of the Soviet Union\nand China\u2019s embrace of\ncapitalism in the 1980s. The\nKim family has remained in\npower despite famine and\nmismanagement, while\ndefending their regime by\ndeveloping nuclear weapons.\nTerritory often changed hands early in the\nSouth Korea was ruled by\nwar, until the front stabilized.\nRhee and the military until a\nbecame a\ntransition to democracy in the 1990s, when it\nsuccessful industrial power following\nthe Japanese development model.\nThe US\ncontinues to maintain a military presence in South Korea, and\ncurrently there are 28,500 troops stationed near the capital of\nSeoul. The border between North and South is considered the\nmost heavily militarized zone in the world.\nThe establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949\nled to continuing diplomatic conflict over the status of Taiwan\nand war on the Korean Peninsula. An additional hotspot is Tibet,\na Himalayan region historically dominated by the Chinese\nEmpire that became an independent nation run by Buddhist\nmonks during the chaotic early years of the Chinese Republic\nin the 1920s. Mao Zedong decided to reclaim Tibet for his\nTenzin\nnew People\u2019s Republic, and sent in troops in 1951.\nGyatso, the Dalai Lama from that time\nis still the exiled spiritual leader of 494 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nTibet, and the \u201cFree Tibet\u201d movement\nis very active around the world.\nLooking across the square at Jokhang temple, Lhasa Tibet.\nInternally, Mao\u2019s own totalitarian style had disastrous\nconsequences for the Chinese. The communists had already\nbegun land reform around 1946 in the parts of China they\ncontrolled, well before their final victory; the policy had gained\nthem widespread support among the vast peasant population.\nWith the nationalists out of the way, Mao\u2019s policy became more\naggressive. He called for the elimination of the landlord class\nof peasants and redistribution of the land more evenly.\nUnfortunately, when Mao said elimination, he meant it. Class-\nmotivated mass killings of landlords continued for the next 30\nyears and estimates of the death tolls range from 14 million to\n28 million. Modern World History 495\nThe purge of landlords was\nfollowed by the Great Leap\nForward, an economic and\nsocial plan from 1958 to 1962\nthat collectivized agriculture\nand promoted industry. Mao\nset up 25,000 \u201cpeople\u2019s\ncommunes\u201d of 5,000 families\neach, which would be\nresponsible for not only\nfeeding themselves and their\nfellow Chinese citizens, but\nfor providing surpluses to\nexport. Mao insisted on\nkeeping grain exports high in\nspite of poor harvests.

In some regions of China,\npeople resorted to cannibalism.\nThis disaster caused some prominent communist party\nmembers to question Mao\u2019s leadership, but he maintained\nsupport in the army and blamed the famine on a lack of socialist\ncommitment among the Chinese. Mao initiated his Great\nProletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966, leading the military to\nrecruit young people to reinforce Maoist ideology and purge\nremnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese\nsociety. Schools and universities were closed, and Red Guard\ntroops were encouraged to harass and even murder\nintellectuals. Educated people were beaten, terrorized, and\nbanished to the countryside to be \u201creeducated\u201d by the peasants.\nThe death toll of the cultural revolution is debated, but\nestimates range from 3 to 10 million. It delayed Chinese\nindustrialization and modernization, and a generation of\nChinese were deprived of an education. 496 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPropaganda oil painting of Mao and students holding up his \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d during\nthe Cultural Revolution, 1967.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Could the Korean War have been avoided?\n\u2022 Was Mao Zedong an effective leader of China?\nAs seen in the last chapter, efforts by the Vietnamese to\nliberate themselves from the French after World War II were\ninitially thwarted. This changed in 1954 when Ho Chi Minh\u2019s\nanti-colonial forces defeated the French in northern Vietnam at\nthe battle of Dien Bien Phu. The French decided to abandon\ntheir colony of Indochina, preferring to focus their efforts on\nmaintaining their empire closer to home in Algeria (which we\nhave seen was also unsuccessful). Ignoring the example of the\nKorean War, the French left Vietnam divided between a\ncommunist north and a non-communist south; with the vague\npromise of an eventual referendum in the south to determine\nwhether or not the country would be reunited.\nThe vote would never take place. The United States began\nsending military advisers to South Vietnam almost as soon as\nthe French withdrew. President Dwight Eisenhower, elected in\n1952, invoked the \u201cdomino theory\u201d to help the unpopular Modern World History 497\nregime in South Vietnam prevent elections which would have\nmade the extremely popular Ho Chi Minh leader of a unified\nnation. This theory posited that every country the \u201cfell\u201d to\ncommunism represented one more step world domination by\nAmerica\u2019s enemies, although after the \u201cSino-Soviet Split\u201d of\n1956, it was unclear which communist nation was the threat in\nVietnam, then Laos, then Cambodia, Burma, India, etc. The U.S.\nalso sent military and economic aid to neighboring Laos, also\nnewly independent from France, in an attempt to prop up a\nmonarchy that was in conflict with Soviet-supported Pathet Lao\nguerrillas.\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s the CIA and U.S. military\nadvisors supported the South Vietnamese government. By the\n1960s, the issue of Vietnam would enormously affect domestic\npolitics in the United States, especially after President Lyndon\nJohnson began sending hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers\nto defend South Vietnam in 1965. In 1969 and 1970, Richard\nNixon bombed and invaded Cambodia, but could not defeat\nthe Viet Cong guerillas. The U.S. finally withdrew in 1973, after\n58,000 U.S. troops and over a million Vietnamese had been\nkilled. Without U.S. support, the government of the South lost\nthe war and Vietnam was unified in 1975. Ho Chi Minh did not\nlive to see it \u2013 he died in 1969 at age 79. 498 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA US Marine moves an old man suspected of being Viet Cong during a search and clear\noperation 15 miles west of Da Nang Air Base, 1965.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Could the Vietnam War have been avoided?\nCold War in the Middle East\nIn the last chapter, we examined how the establishment of Israel\nin 1948 immediately led to a series of conflicts with its Arab\nneighbors. The defeat of Arab forces by Israel in 1949 led to a\nsurge of Arab nationalism, led by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul\nNasser, who became head of state in 1954 after a military coup\nthat ended the Egyptian monarchy. Nasser\u2019s popularity was\ncemented when he took control of the Suez Canal, surrounded\nby Egypt but administered by the British and French, in 1956. Modern World History 499\nhe U.S. and U.S.S.R. forced\nIn this crisis, t\nGreat Britain, France, and Israel to\naccept Egyptian control of the canal to\navoid a larger conflict. Nasser became\na hero for the Arab world, standing up\nto both the old colonial powers and\nwhat the Arabs saw as their creation,\nthe new state of Israel.\nNasser\u2019s ruling model\nbecame an inspiration for\nmany Arabs. Like Mustafa\nKemal Atat\u00fcrk in Turkey in\nthe 1920s, Nasser established\na secular state dedicated to\nimproving the lives of\nordinary people. He largely\nseparated religion and\npolitics, supported\ngovernment intervention in\nNasser greeted by crowds in Alexandria\nthe economy to prevent one day after his announcement of the\nforeign control, and provided British withdrawal and\na failed assassination attempt against him,\nmore and better social\nOctober 1954.\nservices. Nasser, a former\narmy colonel, also relied on the military as the most reliable and\ndisciplined institution to maintain unity and order. This\n\u201cNasserism\u201d became the ideology of the Ba\u2019ath Party, formed in\nSyria and later in Iraq in the 1950s among military officers.\nThe Egyptian leader skillfully took advantage of Cold War\npolitics, playing the United States and the Soviet Union against\neach other in order to gain military and economic aid. The\nSoviets in particular supported the construction of the massive\nAswan Dam, completed in stages by 1970 to control the flooding\nof the Nile while providing hydroelectric power to Egypt.\nNasser preached pan-Arabism, the goal that all Arabs should\nbe united in one federated nation. Egypt and Syria briefly\nunited under this model in the early 1960s, while after Nasser\u2019s\nLibya, Syria, and Iraq federated\ndeath, 500 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nfor a time in the\n1970s. The liberation of Algeria\nfrom France in 1962 was a moment of inspiration; another\nwas the unification of Palestinians in the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization in 1964, led by Yasser Arafat and his Fatah Party.\nHatred and resentment for Israel was (and remains) a powerful\nunifying factor in the region. Arab resistance and Cold War\nconsiderations led the U.S. to continue its support of Israel,\nwhich was supported by Jewish Americans, but also by Christian\nfundamentalist evangelicals, many of whom consider the\nreestablishment of the Israel as the beginning of the\napocalyptical End Times and the return of the Messiah.\nMeanwhile, the Soviet Union sought allies in the Middle East,\nwhich was much closer to its borders than to America. Russia\nstill maintains its only naval base on the Mediterranean in Syria,\ndating from the time it began supporting the Ba\u2019athi Assad\nfamily in that country in the late 1970s.\nNasser (center) mediating an agreement between Yasser Arafat and Jordanian King\nHussein, during the emergency Arab League summit, September 1970.\nTextbooks often describe the Islamic resurgence that began in\nthe 1970s, but usually consider this only as a religious\nmovement. Some critics of Islam claim the Muslim world has\nnever recovered from the First Crusade, when Christian armies\ncaptured Jerusalem in 1099 CE and over the course of a few\ndays murdered almost the entire Muslim population of the city.\nThere may be some truth in this statement, but we don\u2019t have Modern World History 501\nto look back several centuries to find reasons why populations\nthat happen to be Muslim resent populations that happen to\nbe Christian. And if globalization, which we will cover in more\ndetail in the next chapter, is primarily an economic\ndevelopment that has overtaken world politics, then resistance\nto globalization should be considered in economic and political\nterms.\nThe places Muslims and\nChristians most often find\nthemselves in conflict are\noften where western\nEuropeans and Americans\nhave been very active in\nextracting natural resources\nfrom territories occupied by\nMuslims. Western oil\ncompanies in the Persian\nGulf, for example, have had a\ndecisive role in the\nrelationships between the\ngovernments of Britain and\nthe US and the people and\nPrime Minister Mosaddegh with US\nPresident Truman in 1951 governments of the region.\nFor example, when the\nIranian Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, decided to\nnationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now BP), Winston\nChurchill convinced Harry S. Truman that Mosaddegh had to\ngo. Britain\u2019s MI-6 and the CIA organized a coup against the\nelected government of Iran and installed Shah Mohammed\nReza Pahlavi as ruler of Iran in 1953 to insure a steady flow of oil\nout of Iran.\nOil production in Iran rose quickly from less than a million\nbarrels per day in the 1950s to 6 million barrels daily in the\nmid-1970s. However, the oil boom of the 1970s widened the\ngap between the rich and poor in Iran. In 1971, the 2,500th\nanniversary celebration of the founding of the Persian Empire\nby Cyrus the Great in the sixth century BCE was attended by\njet-setters from around the world while Iranians were excluded 502 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nand their poverty was ignored. The Shah began a policy of\nembracing western culture and westernizing Iran; conservative\nMuslims objected. The new consumer goods and cultural\nchanges were generally available only to the richest Iranians,\nand were not accompanied by political liberalization. The\nShah\u2019s secret police force, SAVAK, terrorized the population and\nroutinely assassinated the Shah\u2019s critics. In 1977, SAVAK killed\nseveral Islamic leaders including Mostafa Khomeini, son of the\nayatollah.\nArmed protesters in front of a banner that says, \u201cLong live anti-imperialism and\ndemocratic forces\u201d.\nThe outbreak of the Iranian Revolution caught the Shah by\nsurprise. When the Muslim clergy announced an open-air\nprayer meeting on the annual holiday marking the end of\nRamadan, the Shah panicked and declared martial law. 5,000\nprotesters took to the streets of Tehran. The army fired into the\ncrowd, killing 64 people. The ayatollah Khomeini claimed 4,000\npeople had been killed and workers at Tehran\u2019s oil refineries and\ngovernment workers declared a general strike that brought the\neconomy to a standstill. By early December, more than 10% of\nthe Iranian people were marching in anti-Shah demonstrations.\nThe U.S. Government was hated for helping to install the Shah,\nand also for statements by President Jimmy Carter supporting Modern World History 503\nthe Iranian Government and the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d the Shah\nhad with the U.S. The ailing Shah abandoned Iran, eventually\narriving for treatment in the United States, while Khomeini\nproclaimed a new Islamic Republic.\nA group of Islamist students\nstormed the American\nEmbassy in Tehran in\nNovember 1979 and took the\nstaff as hostages. 52\nAmericans were held for 444\ndays, until the inauguration\nof Ronald Reagan in January\n1981. The ayatollah, who was\nan astute politician as well as a Iranian students storming the US Embassy\nin Tehran, November 1979.\nreligious leader, supported\nkeeping the hostages on\npurely political grounds. He told reporters, \u201cThis action has\nmany benefits\u2026This has united our people. Our opponents do\nnot dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the\npeople\u2019s vote without difficulty.\u201d\nHowever, the new Iranian regime also\nconfronted resistance from the Arab\nworld, especially from Iraqi leader\nSaddam Hussein. Not only were the\nIranians Persian, rather than Arab,\nmost were also followers of Shia Islam,\nrather than the more common Sunni\nbranch which is prevalent in the Arab\nworld and among all Muslims.\nAlthough Shi\u2019ites and Sunnis had lived\nin peace for centuries, Iran\u2019s new\nclerical state was deemed a threat by\nits Arab neighbors, especially by the\nconservative Sunni regime in Saudi\nArabia.\nIraq, however, had its own 504 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nparticularities: not only were the\nspecifically Shia holy sites located in\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s country, but a\nmajority of the Iraqis were Shi\u2019ite\nArabs as well. Hussein, meanwhile, was\na Ba\u2019athist, promoting Arab\nnationalism in a secular state ruled by\nhis military. In September 1980 he\nsent his armies into Iran in an attempt\nto take advantage of what they\nsupposed would be political chaos.\nHussein claimed that he was\nprotecting Arabs living in the Iranian\nborder region, although conveniently,\nthese areas also had vast oil deposits.\nThe Iran-Iraq War lasted 8 years and,\nlike the hostage crisis, helped\nconsolidate the power of the Khomeini\nregime. The US, USSR, France, and\nmany Arab countries provided\nsupport for Iraq, which used chemical\nweapons against Iranian military and\ncivilian targets. The death toll has been\nestimated as 800,000 Iranians and up\nto 500,000 Iraqis. Modern World History 505\nAn Iranian soldier wearing a gas mask during the Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nHussein had gained nothing in the war\nbut debt and demands for autonomy\nby non-Arab ethnic Kurds in northern\nIraq; he responded with chemical\nattacks on civilian Kurdish\npopulations. In 1990, the Iraqi dictator\nthen decided to incorporate Kuwait\ninto his nation, claiming that it had\nhistorically been part of Mesopotamia\n(which was plausible, given the absurd\nway the British had drawn national\nboundaries after World War I). The\nUnited Nations, led by the U.S. pushed\nHussein out of Kuwait. Not even the\nSaudis wanted the Iraqi dictator to take\nthe tiny kingdom, which despite its\nsize had as much oil as Iraq. However,\nalthough it decimated Hussein\u2019s\nretreating army on the infamous 506 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n\u201cHighway of Death\u201d, the coalition\nstopped short of toppling Hussein\nhimself, which would have\nconsequences over the next two\ndecades.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Was the Pan-Arab movement a positive or negative\ndevelopment?\n\u2022 How do you think the history of U.S.-Iranian relations affects\nthe nations\u2019 current relationship?\nLatin America and the Cold War\nThe twentieth century began in Latin America with the Mexican\nPancho Villa in northern\nRevolution, when\nMexico and Emiliano Zapata in\nsouthern Mexico created an\nopportunity for new liberal forces led\nby Alvaro Obregon. After defeating\nVilla on the battlefield, Obregon held\na constitutional convention in 1917\nwhich produced a document that\nembraced agrarian reform, an eight-\nhour work day and the right to\norganize labor unions; and a\ndeclaration that the subsoil belongs to\nthe state in the name of the people.\nThe was a return to the tradition of\nthe Spanish Empire that subsurface\nminerals belonged to the people or to Modern World History 507\nthe state, rather than to individuals or\ncompanies. These ideas were\ninspirational for the rest of Latin\nAmerica and even other parts of the\nworld: the Mexican Revolution\npredated the Bolshevik Revolution by\nseveral months.\nIt took a generation for\nMexico to realize this goal,\nbut in the 1930s, under\nPresident L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas,\nland reform was\nLogo of Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, the implemented that brought\nstate-owned oil company established by\nback indigenous communal\nC\u00e1rdenas. The motto means, \u201cFor the\nrescue of sovereignty\u201d. landholdings, broken up\nduring the Diaz period. And\nin 1938, C\u00e1rdenas nationalized Mexican oil, taking over leases\ngiven to U.S. and British oil companies. The American\npresident, Franklin Roosevelt, who had begun a \u201cGood\nNeighbor Policy\u201d toward Latin America when he took office, to\nemphasize trade and cooperation rather than military force, did\nnot intervene when oil companies objected. Britain acquiesced\nin order to assure Mexican support in what everyone\nunderstood would soon be the next world war.\nC\u00e1rdenas was part of a wave of populist heads of state in Latin\nAmerica, charismatic leaders who tried to address the needs\nof \u201cthe people,\u201d which by the 1930s and 1940s included rural\npeasants as well as the urban working class. Latin American\nPopulism also attracted a rising professional middle class, shut\nout of political power by traditional oligarchies. In Argentina,\nthis new middle class included first-generation immigrants\nfrom Europe who supported a new Radical Party in the first\ndecades of the twentieth century. Argentina was second only to\nthe United States as an immigration choice for impoverished\nEuropeans, particularly Italians, Germans, and Eastern\nEuropean Jews. In other cases, army officers who had received\nprofessional training either at home or abroad by European 508 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmilitary missions felt that the oligarchs were insufficiently\npatriotic and needed to be replaced.\nThe populists also supported nationalist economic measures,\nolicies of import substitution\nincluding p\nindustrialization, land reform, and\nefforts to reduce dependency on\ninternational markets for their mining\nor agricultural goods. The crisis of the\nGreat Depression emphasized the\nimportance of building independent\ndomestic economies and instituting\neducation, housing, and infrastructure\nimprovements for all of the people.\nThe global war against fascism\ninspired many to embrace democracy\nand overthrow long-standing military\nregimes, like in Guatemala, Venezuela,\nand Cuba; although these attempts at\ndemocratic practices were frequently\nshort-lived. Modern World History 509\nBrazilian President Get\u00falio Vargas (left) and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (right) in\n1936\nTwo of the most notable populist leaders are also examples of\ncivilian and military versions of populism: Get\u00falio Vargas of\nBrazil and Juan Per\u00f3n of Argentina. Vargas was an opposition\ncandidate who lost in a fraudulent election to an oligarchy-\nbacked candidate in 1930; a brief uprising made him president.\nHe skillfully faced down a separatist revolt in the wealthy coffee\nstate of Sao Paulo, but after embracing a degree of liberal\ndemocracy, in 1937 Vargas established an authoritarian state in\norder to prevent communist-supported leftists being elected.\nHowever, he also rooted out a new fascist movement and\ndisbanded it as well, setting himself up to accept U.S. aid and\nsupport the Allies in World War II. Brazil was the only nation\nin Latin America to send troops to fight alongside the Allies\nin Europe. Vargas stepped down in 1945, but ran again for\npresident in 1950 and was reelected.\nPer\u00f3n, on the other hand, was an army officer who had served\nas a military attache in Italy in the 1930s, witnessing up close\nthe fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. Argentina at the time was\ngoverned by politicians elected through fraud that suppressed\ncalls for reform by the Radical Party. In 1943, in the midst\nof World War II, the military overthrew the corrupt regime, 510 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ninstituting a government that they felt was more dignified and\nresponded more directly to the people. Juan Per\u00f3n, a key player\nin the coup, chose to become the Minister of Labor. By\nguaranteeing labor law and favoring the workers in\nnegotiations, he became popular among the urban masses in\nBuenos Aires. Although the military regime grew nervous about\nhis growing popularity and had Per\u00f3n arrested, the workers\ncame to his aid. He was released and was elected president of\nArgentina in 1946.\nPer\u00f3n benefited from a postwar economic boom in Argentina.\nHe could promise and deliver on higher wages, better living and\nworking conditions, and vacations for workers as tax revenues\nrolled in because of high international prices for Argentine\nwheat and beef. In the context of the Cold War, Per\u00f3n\nproclaimed that he represented a \u201cthird way\u201d between\nunfettered capitalism and totalitarian communism. Per\u00f3n\nclaimed that his government improved the lives of Argentinians\nwithout having to take sides in the superpower conflict. This\nmade him particularly annoying to the United States, which\noften had to face Argentine opposition at regional conferences.\nPer\u00f3n bet on never-ending\ngood times, especially when it\nseemed that the Korean War\nmight lead to a World War III\nin which Argentina would\nbenefit. However, shortly\nafter he was reelected in 1952,\nPer\u00f3n\u2019s popular wife, Eva\nDuarte, died of ovarian\ncancer at age 33. Hundreds of\nthousands attended her\nfuneral and a cult of \u201cSanta\nEvita\u201d quickly took hold. The\nArgentine economy began to\nsuffer as the world recovered\nfrom World War II and President Juan Per\u00f3n and his wife, \u201cEvita\u201d,\narrive in Madrid.\nArgentina faced competition\nfor its wheat and beef in the Modern World History 511\ninternational market. Like Vargas, Per\u00f3n also faced inflation and\nscandals. A bitter fight with the\npolitical\nCatholic Church led to Per\u00f3n\u2019s ouster\nby the military in 1955 and the\nsuppression of the Peronist movement\nuntil Peron was invited back from exile\nto be reelected president in 1973.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why might Populism have appealed to the people of Latin\nAmerican nations?\n\u2022 Was Mexico justified in nationalizing the country\u2019s oil industry.\nAlthough the United States congratulated itself that it had\nreplaced blatant military intervention and \u201cdollar diplomacy\u201d\nwith a \u201cGood Neighbor Policy\u201d under Franklin Roosevelt,\nnations like Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras were still\nthoroughly dominated by the United Fruit Company (UFC);\nstill Banana Republics. After World War II, the Dulles brothers\nbecame leaders in developing U.S. foreign policy in Latin\nAmerica. John Foster Dulles was a corporate lawyer who had\nhelped negotiate huge land giveaways to UFC by the\ngovernments of Guatemala and Honduras. After serving as a\nSenator from New York, Dulles was appointed secretary of State\nby Dwight Eisenhower in 1953. His brother Allen Dulles was\non UFC\u2019s board of directors before he served as President\nEisenhower\u2019s CIA Director.\nIn 1954 the democratically-elected government of Guatemala\nbegan talking about seizing some of the vast tracts of land the\nUnited Fruit Company had acquired but was not using. The\ngovernment planned to buy back the land from UFC and\nredistribute it to the poor. The Dulles brothers accused the\nGuatemalan government of having close ties with the Soviets\nand sent in the CIA to overthrow it in a military coup. 512 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nGuatemalans resisted the new regime and the country fell into a\ncivil war that lasted from 1960 to 1996 and killed up to 200,000\npeople.\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower with John Foster Dulles, 1956.\nOne of the key elements of Latin America\u2019s relationship with\nthe outside world seems to be the question of revolution and\nthe threat nations like the U.S. claimed to fear, of socialist, anti-\ncapitalist movements in the Western Hemisphere. In many\ncases the anti-capitalism expressed by Latin Americans was\nactually resistance to what they perceived as economic\nimperialism by nations like the U.S., which regularly defended\nAmerican-based corporations that operated freely in their\nnations and often intervened in their politics. Latin American\nnationalist leaders like Get\u00falio Vargas in Brazil (President from\n1930-45 and 1951-54), Juan Per\u00f3n in Argentina (President from\n1946-55 and 1973-4), or L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas in Mexico (President\nfrom 1934-40), who nationalized the Mexican oil industry, were\nnot Marxists, or even particularly socialist in their orientation\nor policies. Import Substitution Industrialization was a capitalist Modern World History 513\napproach to reducing dependency, and even when nations like\nMexico nationalized natural resource extraction, they usually\ncompensated foreign companies for the assets they were\nexpropriating and then they ran the extractive industries as\nbusinesses in the world economy. Even when the government\u2019s\ngoal was something like land reform, they usually tried to\ncompensate the former owners. The conflict over land reform\nin Guatemala was misrepresented by the Dulles brothers. The\nGuatemalan government offered UFC a price for the lands it\ntook back based on the values claimed in the corporation\u2019s tax\nfilings. It may have been an open secret that UFC was\ndefrauding the Guatemalan government, but the government\nwas well within its rights to call that bluff. A truly communist\ngovernment determined to eliminate capitalism in Guatemala\nmight simply have claimed UFC had acquired the lands illegally\nand taken them with no offer of compensation.\nMany idealists in Latin\nAmerica and elsewhere were\nradicalized by the violence\nnations such as the United\nStates approved or initiated to\nprotect the interests of\ncorporations but justified as\ndefenses of democracy. An\nGuevara (right) with Alberto Granado (left) example of this was the\nin June 1952 on the Amazon River aboard experience Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d\ntheir wooden raft, which was a gift from\nGuevara, who witnessed the\nthe lepers whom they had treated during\ntheir motorcycle journey. Bolivian Revolution of 1952\nbefore moving on to\nGuatemala in 1954. Bolivia\u2019s struggle began when the candidate\nof the Movimiento Nationalista Revolucionario(MNR) won the\npresidential election of 1951 but was prevented by the military\nfrom taking office. Victor Paz Estenssoro armed civilians and\nthe MNR took power after 3 days and 600 casualties. He served\nhis first term from 1952 to 1956, and accepted US financial aid in\nreturn for compensating the tin mines he\nnationalized. Estenssoro softened the revolution\u2019s approach to\nrewriting the mineral and petroleum laws, but he did 514 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nredistribute land. Bolivians approved of his leadership and\nEstenssoro was re-elected in 1960, 1964, and 1985.\nPeasants on the altiplano, the high Andean plateau around the\ncity of Cochabamba, seeing the changes in the mining codes,\nbegan seizing haciendas and dividing the land up amongst\nthemselves. The government passed an Agrarian Reform\nDecree in 1953 to capture the campesinos\u2019 support and control\nthe process a bit. Before the revolution, less than 1% of the\nrichest landowners in Bolivia owned half of the country\u2019s land\nand 6% owned 92% of Bolivia. Under the reform, 185,000\npeasant families, about half of all rural families, got titles to an\naverage of about 20 hectares each. National agricultural output\nfell by about 10% after the land distribution, but probably\nbecause people were growing and keeping more produce for\nhome use and trading it informally rather than taking it to\ncommercial or export markets. Some cities saw food shortages,\nbut these were offset by imports and some foreign aid.\nAfter witnessing this\nrevolutionary change in\nBolivia, Guevara went to\nGuatemala and watched a\nsimilar attempt crushed by\nimperialist armies operating\nto protect corporate profits.\nThis experience and his\nromance with a Peruvian\nMarxist economist named\nHilda Gadea Acosta, who he\nmarried in 1955, radicalized\nChe. When he was placed on\nan enemies list by the new\nGuatemalan regime, Guevara\nescaped to Mexico where he\nChe Guevara and Fidel Castro, 1961.\nmet Ra\u00fal and Fidel Castro,\nwho were in exile there following a failed revolutionary coup in\nCuba. Guevara became an ally of the Castros in June 1955 and\njoined the revolution. About 80 revolutionaries arrived in late\nNovember 1956 on the eastern tip of Cuba, but their numbers Modern World History 515\nwere reduced to about 20 in their first skirmish with Fulgencio\nBattista\u2019s army. The survivors fled into the Sierra Maestra\nmountains and enlisted peasants into a guerilla army that\nharried the Cuban army for the next two years. In 1958, Guevara\nexplained the guerillas\u2019 success:\n\u201cThe enemy soldier in the Cuban example which at present\nconcerns us, is the junior partner of the dictator; he is the man\nwho gets the last crumb left by a long line of profiteers that begins\nin Wall Street and ends with him. He is disposed to defend his\nprivileges, but he is disposed to defend them only to the degree\nthat they are important to him. His salary and his pension are\nworth some suffering and some dangers, but they are never worth\nhis life. If the price of maintaining them will cost it, he is better\noff giving them up; that is to say, withdrawing from the face of\nthe guerrilla danger.\u201d\nThe cold war was played out mostly through proxy wars:\nregional conflicts like the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and\nthe Russia-Afghanistan War where the combatants were\nprovisioned, supported, and sometimes joined by troops from\nthe superpowers. Occasionally, the heat level increased and the\nU.S. and U.S.S.R. barely avoided direct conflict. One of those\ntimes was during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S.S.R. became\na trading partner of Cuba after Marxist revolutionaries Fidel\nand Raul Castro and Che Guevara overthrew the American-\nbacked Battista government in 1959 and replaced it with a\nrevolutionary socialist state. President Kennedy supported a\nCIA-sponsored plan to invade Cuba using anti-Castro Cubans\nin 1961, but the Bay of Pigs invasion was a fiasco. In October\n1962 the U.S. discovered that the U.S.S.R. had deployed nuclear\nmissiles in Cuba, less than 100 miles from the continental U.S.\nCastro had not initially been looking for a close alliance with the\nSoviets, but he seems to have believed that the U.S. was going\nto continue its attacks (recently declassified CIA documents\ndescribing several more coup and assassination plans proved\nCastro\u2019s fears were well-founded). 516 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nCIA map showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity in Cuba, September 1962.\nThe 13-day standoff ended with the Soviet Union withdrawing\nits missiles in return for American promises not to try again\nto overthrow Castro. Che Guevara announced \u201cOur revolution\nis endangering all American possessions in Latin America. We\nare telling these countries to make their own revolution.\u201d Che\nheaded the Cuban delegation to the United Nations in 1964,\nwhere he made a speech criticizing apartheid in South Africa\nand said of the U.S., \u201cThose who kill their own children and\ndiscriminate daily against them because of the color of their\nskin; those who let the murderers of blacks remain free,\nprotecting them, and furthermore punishing the black\npopulation because they demand their legitimate rights as free\nmen\u2014how can those who do this consider themselves\nguardians of freedom?\u201d Guevara increasingly believed that the\nglobal north (the northern hemisphere nations) was guilty of\noppressing the global south. He even criticized the U.S.S.R. for\nnot doing enough to end imperialism, accusing Russia of\nforgetting Marx. Che supported the independence movements\nof indigenous peoples and left Cuba to try to encourage these\nrevolutions, first in the Congo and then in Bolivia, where he\nwas captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian government forces in\n1967 and summarily executed. Fidel Castro continued as Cuban\npresident until 2008 when his brother Raul became President.\nFidel died in 2016 and Raul handed over the Presidency in\n2018, although he remains the First Secretary of the Communist\nParty of Cuba until a planned retirement in 2021. Modern World History 517\nTwentieth-century cold-\nwar conflicts involving Oil\nhave not been limited to the\nPersian Gulf. Development of\nVenezuela\u2019s oil resources,\nthought to be at least a fifth of\nknown global reserves, began\nin the 1910s when the\nVenezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez relied country\u2019s president granted\non oil revenue to run programs for the concessions to his friends to\npoor, but failed to diversify his economy.\nexplore, drill, and refine oil.\nThese concessions were\nquickly sold to foreign oil companies. In 1941 a reform\ngovernment gained power and passed the Hydrocarbons Law of\n1943 under which the government would receive 50% of the\nprofits of the oil industry. The outbreak of World War II had\nincreased demand for oil, and the Venezuelan government\ngranted a series of new concessions that were snapped up in\nspite of the 50% tax. The postwar explosion of automobile\nownership in the U.S. continued to drive demand, and\nVenezuelan production increased. Venezuela bought the Cities\nService company and CITGO gas became a key export of\nVenezuela. In 1976, the government nationalized the oil\nindustry. Oil was a mixed blessing for Venezuela, providing high\nlevels of revenue to support government programs benefitting\nthe people; but also preventing Venezuelan industry from\ndiversifying. However, the CITGO sign became a welcome sight\nfor many New Englanders, as the company has donated\nmillions of gallons of home heating oil to help hundreds of\nthousands of families in the Northeastern United States over\nseveral decades.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What were the ulterior motives of Americans behind their\nchoices to intervene in Latin America to fight communism?\n\u2022 What did Ernesto Guevara mean when he described the 518 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndifferences between his soldiers and the government troops?\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s colonialism mostly ended in Africa,\nalthough not without occasional atrocities such as the British\noppression of the Kikuyu in Kenya in a conflict the British still\nlost, despite having overwhelming force on their side. In South\nAfrica, the white government of F. W. De Klerk, who became\npresident in 1989, finally began to dismantle the apartheid\nsystem that had oppressed the black majority for generations.\nNelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a member of a royal native\nfamily of the Xhosa people who became a lawyer in\nJohannesburg and became active in politics after the white\ngovernment began instituting apartheid policies in the 1940s.\nApartheid was a system of racial segregation that completely\nseparated the black majority from the white rulers and deprived\nthem of political and civil rights. Mandela became president\nof the African National Congress (ANC), an organization\nestablished in 1912 to defend the rights of native Africans and\nmixed-race people in South Africa. He was arrested in 1956 for\nsedition and treason. Despite a commitment to non-violence,\nMandela began leading acts of sabotage against government\nproperties in 1961 and was convicted in 1962 and sentenced to\nlife in prison. Modern World History 519\nDe Klerk visited Nelson\nMandela in prison a few\nmonths after becoming\nPresident and spoke with him\nfor 3 hours. In 1990, De Klerk\ncalled for a new Constitution\nand shut down South Africa\u2019s\nnuclear weapons program.\nThen he freed Mandela after\n27 years as a political prisoner\nFrederik de Klerk and Nelson Mandela and lifted the ban on the ANC\nshake hands at the Annual Meeting of the operating as a political party.\nWorld Economic Forum in 1992.\nAfter losing the presidential\nelection to him in 1994, De\nKlerk served as one of Mandela\u2019s Deputy Presidents from\n1994-6. Mandela served as president for a single term and then\nstepped down. He focused on reconciliation while in office and\nin his retirement devoted himself to combatting poverty and\nAIDS.\nCold War in the US\nWisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy\nburst onto the American political\nscene during a speech in Wheeling,\nWest Virginia, in February 1950.\nWaving a sheet of paper in the air,\nMcCarthy falsely announced that he\nwas holding a list of 205 names \u201cthat\nwere made known to the Secretary of\nState as being members of the\nCommunist party and who\nnevertheless are still working and\nshaping [U.S.] policy.\u201d Since McCarthy\nhad no actual list, the number quickly\nchanged to fifty-seven, then eighty- 520 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\none. Finally, he promised to disclose\nthe name of just one communist, the\nnation\u2019s \u201ctop Soviet agent.\u201d The\nshifting numbers brought ridicule, but\nit didn\u2019t matter: McCarthy\u2019s lies won\nhim fame and fueled a new \u201cred\nscare.\u201d\nMcCarthyism was part of a\nwidespread anticommunist\npropaganda campaign\ndirected at Cold War America\nby the U.S. government. Only\ntwo years after World War II,\nPresident Truman issued\nExecutive Order 9835,\nestablishing loyalty reviews\nfor federal employees. The\nFBI conducted close\nexaminations of all potential\n\u201csecurity risks\u201d among\nForeign Service officers.\nWhen the Korean War began,\nJ. Edgar Hoover, head of the Federal\nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover Bureau of Investigation, 1961.\nunsuccessfully petitioned\nTruman to suspend habeus corpus and detain 12,000 Americans\nsuspected of disloyalty. Hoover grew increasingly frustrated\nwith what he saw as the President\u2019s and Supreme Court\u2019s\nobstruction of his ability to prosecute people for their political\nopinions. In 1956, Hoover began a counterintelligence program,\nCOINTELPRO, to disrupt the Communist Party of the USA\n(CPUSA). The scope of Hoover\u2019s suspicions and COINTELPRO\u2019s\ntargets grew to include civil rights groups, feminists,\nenvironmentalists, Native American activists, and anti-war\nprotestors before the program\u2019s dissolution in 1971. The\nprogram\u2019s domestic espionage and psychological warfare tactics\nwere widely criticized. Many believed the FBI had greatly Modern World History 521\noverstepped its authority; some even accused COINTELPRO of\nplanning the assassinations of some of the program\u2019s targets.\nIn Congress, the House Un-American Activities Committee\n(HUAC) and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on\nInvestigations held over a hundred investigations and hearings\non communist influence in American society between 1949 and\n1954. The Internal Security Act, passed by Congress in\nSeptember 1950, required all \u201ccommunist organizations\u201d to\nregister with the government, gave the government greater\npowers to investigate sedition, and made it possible to prevent\nsuspected individuals from gaining or keeping their citizenship.\nIn the first year, the new law turned away over 50,000\nimmigrants from Germany and over 10,000 displaced Russians.\nThere were, of course, American communists in the United\nStates. The CPUSA enjoyed most of its influence as labor\norganizers and as strong opponents of Jim Crow segregation.\nBut even at the height of the Depression, communism never\nattracted many American. McCarthy\u2019s and Hoover\u2019s witch-\nhunts hurled accusations and ruined careers less on people\u2019s\ncommunist sentiments and more on their opposition to civil\nrights and anti-war protestors.\nThe arms race was not only about nuclear technology, but also\na contest to improve the distance and accuracy of missiles which\ncould carry a nuclear load. The missile race indirectly led to the\nspace race, as both the U.S. and the Soviets initiated programs\nAs Germany collapsed at\nfor space exploration.\nthe close of World War II, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union had raced\ntoward Berlin, hoping not only to be\nfirst to occupy the capital but to\nacquire elements of the Nazi V-2\nmissile program and jet propulsion\nproject. In the last months of the war,\nthe Nazis had developed a \u201cvengeance\nweapon\u201d to terrorize England, even\nthough Germany had no hope of\nwinning. The V-2 was the world\u2019s first 522 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nguided ballistic missile, capable of\ncarrying an explosive payload up to six\nhundred miles. Both the U.S. and the\nU.S.S.R. hoped to capture scientists,\ndesigns, and manufacturing\nequipment to build their own rockets.\nGermany\u2019s top rocket scientist,\nWernher von Braun, surrendered to\nU.S. troops and eventually became the\nleader of the American space program.\nAbout 1,600 German scientists and\nengineers found their way into the\nAmerican program. The Soviet\nUnion\u2019s program was managed by Red\nArmy colonel Sergei Korolev, although\nthe Soviet program also had about\n2,000 Germans. Both engineering\nteams worked to adapt German rocket\ntechnology to create an\nintercontinental ballistic missile\n(ICBM) that could carry the new\nnuclear weapons.\nJet technology\ndeveloped even\nmore rapidly. By\nthe time of the\nKorean War, jet\nfighters\nsupported both\nF-86s of the 4th Fighter-interceptor wing,\nsides, using\nKorean War.\nidentical German\ntechnology acquired after World War\nTwo. Commercial jetliners were Modern World History 523\nintroduced in the 1950s, replacing\nocean liners by the 1970s as passenger\ntransport.\nThe Soviets\nachieved success\nin the missile race\nfirst. They even\nused the ICBM\nlaunch vehicle in\nOctober 1957, to\nsend Sputnik, the\nworld\u2019s first\nhuman-made\nsatellite, into\norbit. It was a\ndecisive\ntechnological\nvictory, and the\nSoviet\npropaganda\nministry took full\nadvantage of the\nopportunity to\nbegin a space race\nwhile at the same\ntime warning the\nU.S. that it could\ndeliver nuclear\nweapons to\nAmerican targets.\nIn response, the U.S.\ngovernment rushed to perfect The Apollo 11 Saturn V rocket lifts off, July\nits own ICBM technology and 16, 1969.\nin 1958 established the 524 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to\nlaunch satellites and astronauts into space. Initial American\nattempts to launch a satellite into orbit suffered spectacular\nfailures, heightening fears of Soviet domination in space. While\nthe American space program struggled, the Soviet Union\u2019s Luna\n2 capsule became the first human-made object to touch the\nmoon in September 1959. Then the U.S.S.R. successfully\nlaunched a pair of dogs (Belka and Strelka) into orbit and\nreturned them to Earth alive in August 1960 while the American\nMercury program languished behind schedule (the first dog the\nSoviets sent to orbit, Laika, died during the trip). Cosmonaut\nYuri Gagarin was launched into orbit on April 12, 1961.\nAmerican astronaut Alan Shepard accomplished a suborbital\nflight in the Freedom 7 capsule on May 5. The United States\nhad been embarrassed, and John Kennedy used America\u2019s\nfrustration over early losses in the \u201cspace race\u201d to bolster\nfunding for a manned moon landing, which succeeded on July\n20, 1969.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How did anxiety about communism injure civil rights in\nAmerica?\n\u2022 Why was the United States so motivated to beat the U.S.S.R.\nin the space race?\nThe Cold War ended with the 80s. Between 1989 and 1991, the\nSoviet system collapsed and Russia lost control of its Eastern\nEuropean satellites. Soviet leaders Yuri Andropov and Mikhail\nGorbachev began relaxing the strict controls the state had been\nexercising on satellite states. Andropov prevented the U.S.S.R.\nfrom invading Poland in 1981 to crush the Solidarity movement,\nas they had done during the Prague Spring in 1968. By 1989,\nSolidarity was included in multiparty elections in Poland and\nthe movement\u2019s leader, Lech Walesa, was elected President\n(1990-95). Andropov\u2019s successor, Gorbachev began a process of Modern World History 525\nperestroika, restructuring the economy, in 1986 and introduced\nglasnost, a policy of increased openness in politics and support\nfor individual rights including freedom of speech. The freedom\nof speech Gorbachev granted included freedom to criticize the\ngovernment, which he would be unable to control.\nIn October 1989, East Germany\u2019s longtime leader resigned.\nErich Honecker had been instrumental in building the Berlin\nWall in 1961. Honecker had then ruled the communist nation\nfrom 1971 until 1989, and had ordered East German troops to\nfire on people trying to escape to West Berlin. Over a thousand\npeople were killed over the years. The wall only lasted three\nweeks after Honecker\u2019s removal from office. He fled first to\nRussia and then to Chile to evade prosecution over giving the\norder to fire on people fleeing from East Germany, but by this\ntime he was suffering from advanced liver cancer. Germany\ndidn\u2019t fight too hard to extradite Honecker and he died in 1994\nin Santiago.\nHonecker had honestly\nbelieved the Berlin Wall was\nunavoidable and that by\nbuilding it he had prevented a\n\u201cthird world war with\nmillions dead.\u201d Tearing down\nthe wall and reunifying\nGermany in 1990 were\nmilestones in the end of the\nGermans stand on top of the Wall in front Cold War.

The president of the\nRussian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, supported Gorbachev and\nthwarted the coup. Although Gorbachev had been returned to\nthe Kremlin, Yeltsin began gaining power for himself and Russia\nat the expense of the Gorbachev and the U.S.S.R. In late 1991,\nYeltsin flew the Russian flag over the Kremlin alongside the\nSoviet flag. On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned as\nPresident of the USSR in a televised speech, and handed over 526 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthe Soviet nuclear codes to Yeltsin. The following day, the\nU.S.S.R. was dissolved and Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev\u2019s office\nat the Kremlin.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union left the US as the world\u2019s\nonly superpower.

What\u2019s new about the agenda\ndescribed by this adjective, and what\u2019s liberal?\n529 530 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nPanamax container ship SHENZHEN BAY transiting the Panama canal.\nAt its most basic, globalization refers to business activities\nand the actions of governments beginning to be conducted on\na worldwide scale. As we\u2019ve seen, this has been happening\nthroughout the modern period we\u2019ve been covering, if not\nbefore. The voyages of Zheng He, the European colonial project\nin the Americas, the Atlantic Slave Trade, and the activities\nof the British East India Company in India and China were\nall conducted at a worldwide scale, and all had commercial\nelements. Conflicts such as the Seven Years War, the War of 1812,\nand World Wars I and II have also involved multiple continents.\nAnd events like the Columbian Exchange, which made\nAmerican staple crops available to feed growing world\npopulations, and the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d pandemic which killed up\nto 500 million people throughout the world, also had global\nconsequences. Modern World History 531\nAs we begin to look at the most recent wave of economic and\npolitical globalization, big commodities like petroleum become\nprominent again. Twentieth-century economic colonialism\ninvolving oil was not limited to the Persian Gulf. As we have\nseen, before Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia became leading\nproducers, Mexico was a heavy supplier of oil to the US in the\n1920s. In 1938, Mexican President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas invoked the\nnew, 1917 Mexican Constitution to nationalize all oil production\nin Mexico.\nThe constitution, which had been written during the Mexican\nRevolution, stated that the nation owned all the subsoil assets\nof Mexico, and C\u00e1rdenas formed the government-owned oil\ncompany PEMEX to extract and refine Mexican petroleum\nresources. Although the corporations (particularly Royal Dutch\nShell and Standard Oil) objected loudly, Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s\nadministration, which was busy implementing the New Deal\nat home to ease the impact of the Great Depression on the\nAmerican people, acknowledged the right of the Mexican\npeople to control their own resources. Soon, the advent of\nWorld War II encouraged the Allied nations to put anti-fascist\nsolidarity before the losses of a couple of U.S. corporations.\nPEMEX prospered and became Latin America\u2019s second largest\ncorporation in 2009 (after Petrobras, the Brazilian national oil\ncompany). 532 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned earlier,\ndevelopment of Venezuela\u2019s\noil resources (thought to be at\nleast 1/5th of known global\nreserves) began in the 1910s,\nwhen the country\u2019s president\ngranted concessions to his\nfriends to explore, drill, and\nrefine oil \u2013 and these Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on a\nconcessions were quickly sold visit to Brazil in 2003.\nto foreign oil companies.

Oil was a mixed blessing for Venezuela,\nproviding high levels of revenue for the government but also\npreventing Venezuelan industry from diversifying. In recent\ndecades, Venezuela used its oil revenue to pay for a wide range\nof social welfare programs for its people. The U.S. criticized\nthese policies as socialist, but they were rarely done without\nwidespread popular support in Venezuela. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who\nwas president from 1998 to his death in 2013, criticized the U.S.\ngovernment vehemently but also continued the Venezuelan\npolicy of giving free heating oil to hundreds of thousands of\npoor people in the US and Europe.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did President Franklin Roosevelt decide not to intervene Modern World History 533\non behalf of foreign oil companies in Mexico?\n\u2022 What was Venezuela\u2019s motivation for nationalizing its oil and\nthen giving some away to poor people in the U.S.?\nAfter increasing during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s\nand then peaking during Russia\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in the\nearly 1980s, oil prices languished in the late 80s, exacerbating\nthe Soviet Union\u2019s economic problems. In the early 1990s after\nthe Soviet breakup, Russia began exporting millions of barrels\ndaily into the world market. The dissolution of the U.S.S.R. and\nthe Warsaw Pact accelerated the globalization of commerce.\nGlobalization in this new phase is characterized by increased\nforeign investment by transnational corporations, privatization\nof state enterprises, free movement of capital across national\nborders, and a reduction of tariffs that impede the movement of\nproducts. A wave of deregulation accompanied these changes,\nas nations competed to attract businesses that were suddenly\nfree to locate themselves anywhere resources, labor, and\nenvironmental costs were lowest.\nThis free movement of\ncapital across national\nborders was heralded by\nwestern pundits as the final,\ndecisive victory of the free\nmarket over socialism and\ncommunist totalitarianism. In\nRussia, people who had been\nPresident Boris Yeltsin handing the members of the political elite\nPresidential Emblem to Vladimir Putin. were suddenly in position to\nbuy up state-owned assets the\ngovernment was selling at fire-sale prices. These opportunities\nwere especially lucrative during Vladimir Putin\u2019s\nadministration, which began in 1999 when Putin became Prime\nMinister while Yeltsin was still president. The new Prime\nMinister had previously been a K.G.B. counter-intelligence 534 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nofficer in East Germany, who had become Director of the F.S.B.\n(the successor to the K.G.B.) in 1998. Putin\u2019s friends and allies\ndid extremely well in the sell-off of Soviet state industries. With\nthe spike in oil prices in the early 2000s these men made vast\nfortunes and became some of the billionaire oligarchs we now\nsee running the Russian economy for their own benefit. The\nchange to capitalism in Russia did much less than it might have\nto benefit the general population because the oligarchs captured\nso much of the profit. The man who captured the most profit\nseems to have been Vladimir Putin himself. Putin\u2019s net worth\nin 2018 was estimated around $200 billion, or about twice the\nwealth of Jeff Bezos and four times that of Bill Gates, the two\nmen who then topped the Forbes list of the world\u2019s richest\npeople.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Why might a leader such as Alexander Putin wish to hide his\nwealth?\nOne of the important\nforces driving globalization has been the removal of\nprotectionist trade policies around the world. This trend began Modern World History 535\nin 1947 with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT), a free-trade agreement of 23 noncommunist nations.\nOver time, GATT reduced average tariff levels between member\nnations from 22% in 1947 to just 5% in 1999. The World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) that followed GATT is a more permanent\nagreement that covers trade in services and intellectual\nproperty as well as physical products. The WTO, headquartered\nin Geneva, has 164 member states including, recently, China.\nAlthough the WTO\u2019s charter calls on it to \u201censure that trade\nflows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible\u201d\nthroughout the world, critics argue it favors rich nations over\npoor nations; especially in its binding arbitration processes that\nfunction like an international trade court, whose decisions take\nprecedence over local or even national court judgments. Global\ncorporations that can deploy teams of lawyers (or even station\nthem permanently in Geneva) to argue in their interest seem\nto have a disproportionate influence on WTO decisions. The\nprocess is designed to take a year (or 15 months with appeals)\nand the WTO says that since 1995, over 500 disputes have been\nbrought and 350 rulings have been issued. Most of these rulings\nhave benefitted the transnational corporations, often at the\nexpense of workers, consumers, and the environment.\nThe 2020 Fortune Global 500 Top 10 corporations.\nTransnational corporations are uniquely suited to take\nadvantage of this new world economy. Technically there are\nabout 50,000 global corporations, but the number of\ncorporations that are as important as states in the world 536 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\neconomy is a bit smaller. Last year\u2019s (2020) Fortune Magazine\nGlobal 500 was topped by Walmart, Sinopec Group (a Beijing-\nbased oil and gas company), State Grid (the Chinese national\nelectric company), China National Petroleum (another Beijing-\nbased oil and gas company), and Royal Dutch Shell Toyota.\nThe next five on the list are Saudi Aramco (oil company),\nVolkswagen, BP, Amazon, and Toyota. Placement on this list is\nbased on revenues, which is similar to the GDP used to measure\nthe size of national economies. If Walmart was a nation, it would\nbe larger than all but 23 of the 211 members of the United\nNations.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 What are the implications of the top global corporations\nbeing larger than all but the largest nations?\n\u2022 How might a greater shift toward China in the \u201cTop 500\u201d list\naffect the world balance of political power?\nFree trade and \u201claissez faire\u201d capitalism are typically believed\nto be a \u201cconservative\u201d value, so some people have been\nsurprised to see the recent Republican (Trump) administration\nopposing agreements like NAFTA and TPP and the Democrats\n(Clinton, Obama, Biden) supporting them. Globalist trade\npolicies have often been called \u201cneoliberal,\u201d but this is another\nconfusing term. The elements that make this ideology \u201cNeo\u201d\nare in many ways the opposite of liberalism. Since the\nEnlightenment in social and political thinking that preceded\nthe American Revolution, \u201cliberal\u201d has referred to a focus on\nexpanding the rights and liberties of regular people, often\nagainst the power of governments. Today the liberties being\nprotected by neoliberalism are often those of corporations,\nwhich in many cases have gained so much power over the lives\nof regular people that they are a more immediate threat than\ngovernments. Modern World History 537\nPresident Bill Clinton watching V.P. Al Gore debate Ross Perot about NAFTA.\nNAFTA was an example of neoliberal policy that increased the\nliberty of corporations at the expense of people. In a 1992\npresidential debate, billionaire Reform Party candidate Ross\nPerot argued:\n\u201cWe have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It\u2019s pretty simple: If\nyou\u2019re paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you\ncan move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour\nfor labor,\u2026have no health care\u2014that\u2019s the most expensive single\nelement in making a car\u2014have no environmental controls, no\npollution controls and no retirement, and you don\u2019t care about\nanything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound\ngoing south.\u201d\nPerot went on to explain that although in the long run and from\na global perspective, globalization makes economic sense, it was\nnot necessarily good for America. He said,\u201dwhen [Mexico\u2019s] jobs\ncome up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours\ngo down to six dollars an hour, and then it\u2019s leveled again. But\nin the meantime, you\u2019ve wrecked the country with these kinds\nof deals.\u201d Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill\nClinton, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement,\nwhich went into effect on January 1, 1994. 538 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThe aim of NAFTA was to create a free-trade zone in North\nAmerica and eliminate tariff barriers that made American\nexports more expensive in Mexico and Mexican exports more\nexpensive in the U.S. Among the results, Mexico has risen to the\nsecond largest market for U.S. agricultural products, especially\nmeat. Mexico has also become a large consumer of U.S. corn\nwhich receives extensive subsidies from the U.S. government.\nCheap American corn has impacted the ability of Mexican\nfarmers to compete and has also impacted the biodiversity of\nmaize, which you\u2019ll remember was originally developed in\nMexico. Indigenous varieties are threatened by the\nmonoculture of U.S.-developed hybrids \u2013 and since corn is\nwind-pollenated, the indigenous varieties are in actual danger\nof being lost. The danger of losing the genetic diversity of\nMexican maize is that monocultures are vulnerable \u2013\nremember the Irish potato famine? A pest or disease that wiped\nout Monsanto\u2019s GMO corn would be bad for the company, but\nit would become a global disaster if scientists had no other\nvarieties they could use to produce a new, resistant hybrid. Corn\nis the leading staple crop in the world. Do we really want to put\nall our eggs in one basket?\nAlthough the proponents of NAFTA claimed and predicted\nthat the trade agreement would benefit all three nations, about\neleven months after the agreement went into effect, the Mexican Modern World History 539\neconomy melted down. In late 1994, after Mexican investors\ndecided to put their now-mobile capital in more stable\ninvestments abroad, the Mexican government was forced to\ndevalue its currency and implement painful deflationary and\nausterity programs in order to get a bailout from the IMF. The\nexperts and pundits all agreed that NAFTA was not to blame,\nand for the most part, the press either ignored or\nmisrepresented the Mexican financial crisis, which it nicknamed\nthe Tequila Crisis.\nPerhaps the greatest effect of NAFTA on Mexico has been\nthe rise of Mexican factories called maquialadoras which were\nlocated just south of the border and made products for the US\nmarket. In the five years after NAFTA\u2019s 1994 implementation,\nmaquila employment nearly doubled. These factories in border\ntowns adjacent to the U.S. manufacture goods using supplies\nshipped to them duty-free, which they then ship back north.\nBy 2004, maquiladoras accounted for 54% of Mexico\u2019s exports\nto the U.S., and U.S. exports had grown to 90% of Mexico\u2019s\ntotal exports. The advantages for U.S. manufacturers were lower\nwages than the U.S. (in 2015 the Mexican hourly wage averaged\n$0.55) and fewer environmental and worker-safety regulations. 540 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAlthough Mexico has fairly strict labor laws, maquiladoras are\nimmune and the majority of workers are young women who are\nless likely to organize. As low as the pay is, after the Mexican\nrecession of the 1990s these jobs sometimes pay better than\nother available work for poor Mexicans. However, the gains\nin Mexican employment have been matched by losses in the\nU.S. As Perot had predicted, until wages for factory workers in\nMexico rise substantially, workers in the United States will not\nbe able to compete for these jobs. Despite the U.S. recession in\nthe early 2000s and competition from other even lower-wage\nareas like Asia, there are still over 3,000 maquiladoras along the\nUS-Mexican border.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did NAFTA receive so much bipartisan support in the\nU.S. before its passage?\n\u2022 Were the overall affects of NAFTA positive or negative for the\nU.S.?\n\u2022 Who benefitted the most? Who suffered most?\nTPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was designed to be NAFTA\non steroids. TPP was established in 2016 to create a common\nmarket for countries bordering the Pacific. It sought to\neliminate tariff and regulatory barriers to trade between most\nof the nations on the Pacific rim, to create a common market\nbetween Asia and the west coasts of North and South America.\nTPP would also to establish an Investor-state dispute system that\nwould allow global corporations to sue countries for practices\nthey deem to be discriminatory. This means that if a national\ngovernment tries to set a national minimum wage, mandate\nworker rights or safety regulations, or protect the environment,\ncorporations can sue to have the laws changed or can demand\ncompensation for their \u201closses\u201d. Modern World History 541\nMap of TPP. Dark green are members; light green nations interested in joining.\nCritics argue this raises the status of corporations to make them\nequal or even superior to sovereign nations, allowing them to\nsue in an \u201cInvestor Court\u201d that would favor their interests over\nthe rights of citizens passing laws to safeguard workers\u2019 rights,\nthe environment, or other local concerns that impact the global\ncorporation\u2019s profits. This is another way neoliberal policies\nsubvert the democratic institutions created by the original\nliberalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nIronically, NAFTA already includes an investor-state court\nsystem for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, but since most of\nthe companies that would use this system are U.S.-based, it\nis not seen as being an issue for Americans. TPP would be a\nmuch bigger source of lawsuits from transnational corporations\nnot originally based in America and the U.S., which has higher\nminimum wages, worker safety standards, and environmental\nregulations, would probably be a target of many.\nIn 1999, protestors picketed\nmeetings of the WTO in\nSeattle and in 2011 Occupy\nWall Street protested wealth\ninequality in New York.\nPresident Trump\u2019s move in\nJanuary 2017 to withdraw the\nU.S. from TPP was applauded\nBanner from the 1999 WTO protest in\nby Progressives like Bernie\nSeattle.\nSanders and Elizabeth 542 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nWarren. In rare agreement with Trump, Sanders said, \u201cFor the\nlast 30 years, we have had a series of trade deals\u2026which have\ncost us millions of decent-paying jobs and caused a \u2018race to\nthe bottom\u2019 which has lowered wages for American workers.\u201d\nOn the other hand, mainstream Republicans like Senator John\nMcCain criticized what he called \u201ca troubling signal of American\ndisengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time when we can\nleast afford it.\u201d McCain\u2019s concerns may have been genuine, but\nin the last five years of his life, McCain\u2019s campaign committee\nand PAC raised and spent about $17 million dollars, mainly from\ncorporations like General Electric and Pinnacle West Capital\nthat had an interest in the success of TPP. The support shown\nby \u201ccentrists\u201d of both political parties in the U.S., and the\nopposition of populists on the left and right wings of both\nparties, suggests a growing sense among regular people that\nboth parties are under the control of their political donors, and\nno longer governing for the people.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 In what ways might TPP be more challenging for the U.S. than\nNAFTA?\n\u2022 What do you make of the agreement of \u201cPopulists\u201d on the left\nand the right over U.S. trade policy?\nAn important element of the shift away from a U.S.-centered\nglobalization is the growing economic power of Asia. Japan\u2019s\neconomy was jump-started after WWII by U.S. aid including\na $2 billion direct investment and letting Japan off the hook\nfor war reparations. Japanese goods were also given preferential\naccess to U.S. consumer markets, so the Japanese economy\nfocused on low-wage industries producing products for export\nto America. The United States no longer considered Japan a\nthreat, but rather as a potential ally against communist China.\nThe Japanese people, already quite accustomed to austerity,\ncomplied with their government\u2019s new industrial policy and Modern World History 543\nJapan reinvested its earnings and rapidly grew from a producer\nof cheap knock-off copies of American products to an innovator\nin high technology.\nOther Asian nations like\nSingapore, South Korea, and\nTaiwan followed in Japan\u2019s\nfootsteps in the 1960s and\n70s, often also with aid from\nthe U.S. designed to slow the\nspread of communism during\nthe Cold War. After the death\nof Mao Zedong in 1976, Deng\nXiaoping gained power in\n1978 and China began shifting\ntoward a market economy in\nwhich the government would\ndirect development with\nincentives rather than decrees\nChinese leader Deng Xiaoping with US\nPresident Jimmy Carter in 1979. and directives. In addition to\na plentiful supply of cheap\nlabor, China had high savings rates and Deng\u2019s devaluation of\nthe nation\u2019s currency allowed Chinese savings and foreign\nexchange surpluses to be invested in securities like American\ngovernment bonds. This made China the world\u2019s bank, as\nnations like the U.S. fell deeper into debt. Finally, a rising\nstandard of living in China has created a new middle class and a\nhuge consumer market.\nIn 2002, ninety percent of the Chinese population lived in\npoverty, with seven percent listed as middle class, two percent\nupper-middle class, and one percent considered affluent by\nworld standards. By 2012, the number of poor in China has been\nreduced to twenty-nine percent. Two thirds of the poor (nearly\na billion people) have improved standards of living, in one of\nthe most momentous shifts in world history. Fifty-four percent\nof Chinese in 2012 were considered middle class, and that fifty-\nfour percent is expected to rise to upper-middle class status by\n2022, with another twenty-two percent moving from poverty\ninto the middle class, leaving only sixteen percent of Chinese\npeople in poverty. This is nearly the same income demographic 544 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nwe see in nations like the U.S., which has a ten percent poverty\nrate. China is becoming a dominant force in the world economy\nonce again, and the increased spending power of the Chinese\npeople will soon drive the global market. Chinese demand for\nitems like automobiles is expected to outpace the rest of the\nworld for the foreseeable future. Companies like Foxconn,\nwhich began as a contract manufacturer of low-tech items like\ncomputer cases, has become a nearly $5 billion manufacturer\nof the highest tech items like Apple iPhones and computers.\nLenovo, which began as a Hong Kong PC clone company in\n1984, has been the world\u2019s largest personal computer maker\nsince 2013. Lenovo acquired IBM\u2019s PC division in 2005, and the\nfamous IBM ThinkPad became a Chinese product. Lenovo does\nabout $45 billion in annual revenue and was the world\u2019s largest\ncell-phone maker until 2016 when it was overtaken by Apple\nand Samsung.\nAs Chinese purchasing power increases, world industry is will\nbe challenged with producing consumer goods without\nexhausting finite resources or destroying the environment.\nChinese cities have been known for their pollution, especially\nfor their poor air quality. An increasingly affluent population\nmay become less willing to tolerate environmental destruction,\nwhich might be a positive change. Hopefully, Chinese interest Modern World History 545\nin projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks\nto connect China with the rest of Asia, Europe, and Africa in\na \u201cNew Silk Road\u201d, will include a commitment to the\nenvironments of the places China finds its natural resources\nand markets for consumer goods, rather than the approach to\nhinterlands taken by earlier world economic powers, in which\nout of sight often meant out of mind.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 In what ways was the U.S. instrumental in creating the \u201cAsian\nTiger\u201d economies?\n\u2022 How did Mao Zedung\u2019s death change Chinese economic and\ntrade policy?\nThe European Union grew\nout of a 1957 trade agreement\nthat expanded on GATT to\nform the European Economic\nCommunity (EEC) including\nFrance, Belgium, West\nGermany, the Netherlands,\nand Luxembourg. Like\nNAFTA, the EEC reduced\ntariffs and other barriers to\ntrade. In 1993, the European\nUnion was formed including\nGrowth of the European Economic\nthe original EEC members as\nCommunity/European Union.\nwell as Austria, Denmark,\nFinland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the\nUnited Kingdom. In 1999, 16 member nations adopted a single\ncurrency, the Euro, although Sweden and the UK retained the\nKrone and the Pound Sterling. The English financial district\ncalled the City of London has always been a center of European\nbanking and finance, and the British were desperate to protect 546 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nthe Pound against the German Deutschmark and the growing\npower of the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank. In the\nearly 2000s several Eastern European nations joined, bringing\nmembership up to 28 nations. Most of these new members\nadopted the Euro as well, and after the global financial crisis of\n2007-8, the Eurozone established emergency loan procedures\nthat allowed richer members to bail out the economies of\npoorer members in exchange for what the lenders termed\neconomic reforms. Borrowers often viewed these reforms as a\ntakeover of their economies and harsh austerity programs.\nIn June 2016 the United Kingdom held a referendum and in\na shocking nationalist vote the majority decided to leave the\nEuropean Union. Brexit is scheduled to go into effect at the\nend of March 2019. The residents of Scotland and Northern\nIreland both voted to remain in the EU, but their votes were\noutweighed by the English and they will be forced to leave along\nwith the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland will remain an\nEU member, which will complicate the situation on the border\nbetween Ireland and British Northern Ireland. The economic\nimpact on Britain is difficult to calculate, but EU nations seem\ndisinclined to allow Britain to retain the favored trade status\nit currently enjoys. And although many British people and\npoliticians wished to reverse the decision to leave, the EU was\nunwilling to pretend the Brexit decision never happened.\nDuring 2020, an eleven-month transition period was agreed\nupon, to allow negotiators to establish post-Brexit policies. At\nthe end of 2020, an agreement seems to have been reached that\nwill allow the UK and the EU to continue trading without tariffs\nin 2021. Modern World History 547\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 What were the arguments for and against \u201cBrexit\u201d? Which do\nyou find more compelling?\nIn addition to the increase in international trade, global\nculture has been permanently changed by communications\ntechnology. Computer networks and cell phones continued a\nprocess begun with the printing press, the telegraph, radio, and\ntelevision. Each of these technologies has been used to spread\nideas to wider audiences, often against the wishes of those in\npower. More recent inventions like fax machines, data\ncommunication via modems, the internet, and most recently\nsmart phones and social networks have been used to spread\nnews of events like the Tiananmen Square protests, the Arab\nSpring, and the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. In spite of the\nefforts of some nations like China and Saudi Arabia to censor\nmedia and limit internet access, it is increasingly difficult to\nfirewall societies from the global media culture. 548 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBecause the virtual world is\nbecoming as important to the\nglobal economy as the\nphysical world of \u201cbricks and\nmortar\u201d commerce and\ncommunication, let\u2019s take a\nmoment to review the\ntechnological, government,\nand business changes that ARPANET in 1970\nenabled it. One of the first\ncomputer networks was the semi-automatic business research\nenvironment (SABRE) launched by IBM in 1960, which initially\nconnected two mainframe systems and grew into an airline\nreservation system. In 1963, American psychologist and\ncomputer scientist JCR Licklider proposed a concept he called\nthe \u201cIntergalactic Computer Network\u201d when he became the first\ndirector of the Pentagon\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(ARPA). Licklider described it as \u201can electronic commons open\nto all, the main and essential medium of informational\ninteraction for governments, institutions, corporations, and\nindividuals.\u201d\nARPANET, begun in 1969, was a network of networks, joining\ngovernment facilities and research universities on a system\ndedicated to official communications. It was permissible for\nresearchers and users to occasionally communicate personally\nwith each other using email. Commercial and political\ncommunications, however, were strictly forbidden. A computer\nscientist named Ted Nelson developed the basic ideas that\nbecame hypertext and the web between 1965 and 1972. Nelson\u2019s\nversion of hypertext was based on the idea that there would be a\n\u201cmaster\u201d record of any document on the network. Exact copies\nof that document (which Nelson called transclusions in his 1980\nbook, Literary Machines) would point back to the original. Ideally,\nrather than just referring to the original, they would actually call\nup the original document wherever possible, eliminating the\nproliferation of copies. Modern World History 549\nPhoto of the Hypertext Editing System (HES) console in use at Brown University, circa\nOctober 1969.\nThis ideal was never really achieved, because even though\nstorage was expensive, bandwidth was even scarcer. This is\nunfortunate, because the existence of bi-directional links would\nhave allowed the owner of a document to know where and when\nit was used, and to have received compensation for its use. Two-\nway linkage was much more difficult to implement than a one-\nway hyperlink that launched the user to a new place on the web.\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak compared the two in a speech\nabout Nelson in the 1990s, saying one-way linking was a cool\nhack, while two-way linking required computer science.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How do computers and communication networks affect\nworld culture and politics?\n\u2022 What do you think the internet would be like now, if it had not\noriginally been a scientific/government network? 550 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nAfter the introduction of Apple Macintosh and IBM Personal\nComputers in the 1980s and the growth of online\ncommunication and file-sharing using services such as\nCompuserve and Prodigy in the early 1990s, in 1992, an online\ngame provider called Quantum Link that had renamed itself\nAmerica Online offered a Windows version of its free access\nsoftware. AOL free trial CDs became ubiquitous; CEO Steve\nCase claimed that at one point in the 90s half the CDs produced\nworldwide had an AOL logo. By the mid-1990s, AOL had passed\nboth Prodigy and CompuServe, and in 1997 more than half of\nall U.S. homes with internet access got it through AOL. The\neconomic power of the online access was becoming apparent: in\n1998 AOL acquired Netscape, in 1999 MapQuest, and in 2000\nAOL merged with Time Warner.\nThe commercial nature of\nsubscriptions like AOL stood\nin sharp contrast, for a while,\nto the early internet. The\ninventor of the World Wide\nWeb, Tim Berners-Lee, was a\nscientist at CERN in\nSwitzerland when he wrote\n\u201cInformation Management: A\nTim Berners-Lee\u2019s NeXT computer, the Proposal\u201d in March 1989.\nworld\u2019s first web server.\nSomebody jotted on the front\npage of the paper, \u201cVague but\nexciting\u201d, and Tim was given time to work out the details on a\nNeXT computer in his lab. By October 1990, Berners-Lee had\nwritten the three basic technologies of the web: HTML\n(Hypertext Markup Language), the formatting language of the\nweb; URI (Uniform Resource Identifier, AKA URL), which\ncontains the protocol (http, ftp, etc.), the domain name\n(example.com), and folder and file names (like /blogs/index);\nand HPPT (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which allows retrieval\nof linked resources.\nBeing a government-funded research facility, CERN decided\nto make the protocols freely available, but it was the Modern World History 551\ndevelopment of the MOSAIC browser by graduate student Marc\nAndreessen in 1993 that made Berners-Lee\u2019s inventions the\nsolid basis of the web. Andreessen graduated, moved to\nCalifornia and met Jim Clark, who had recently left Silicon\nGraphics. They formed Netscape and made their browser,\ncalled Navigator, available for free to non-commercial users.\nNetscape Navigator was destroyed by Microsoft\u2019s decision to\nbundle its own browser, Internet Explorer, with Windows 95.\nMicrosoft made it very difficult for PC manufacturers or even\nusers to uninstall IE and use Netscape and Java, which led to\nan antitrust case in Feb 2001, in which the court ruled that\nMicrosoft had abused its monopoly powers. Netscape never\nrecovered from losing the \u201cfirst browser war\u201d however, and was\nacquired by AOL in 1999.\nFrom 1991 (when there was only one at CERN) to 1994, when\nYahoo launched, the number of websites rose to 2,738. The\nfollowing year, when Altavista, Amazon, and AuctionWeb began,\nthe number of websites had increased nearly tenfold to 23,500.\nIn 1998, when Google launched, the number of websites had\njumped tenfold again, to 2,410,000. The early years of the web,\nknown as Web 1.0, were a period when people with modest\nskills could acquire a domain and build a website. One of the\nfirst powerful and intuitive apps for building websites and pages\nwas Microsoft\u2019s Frontpage. It was a Windows app that provided\na WSIWYG design interface and output usable HTML code.\nMillions of people used the program to build personal and small\ncommercial websites. Discontinued in 2003, Frontpage was not\nreplaced by anything with similar power and ease of use. Partly\nthis is because in Web 2.0 the do-it-yourself (DIY) element of\nthe web has largely disappeared.\nIn 1999, a new generation of the web called Web 2.0 was\nannounced, which claimed to focus on participation by users\nrather than people simply viewing content passively. One\nexample of this participatory nature of the new web is the\nproliferation of social media. Another is people posting videos\non YouTube. The web has also become a site of commerce\nthough, so the most important instance of \u201cparticipation\u201d by\nweb users is as consumers buying stuff \u2013 either web content 552 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nlike Netflix videos or iTunes music, or real-world goods on e-\ncommerce sites like Amazon.\nMap of the internet about 2005.\nBy 2001, when Wikipedia began, there were over a half billion\ninternet users and over 29 million websites. There were a billion\nusers in 2005, when YouTube and Reddit began, but growth\nhad slowed to only 64,780,000 websites and a much larger\npercentage of them were commercial rather than personal. By\n2010, when Pinterest and Instagram launched, there were 2\nbillion web users and the number of websites had actually\ndeclined from the previous year for the first time, to about\n207,000.\nIn the 2010s the rest of the world caught up to the US in web\nuse and website building. By 2015 there were well over 3 billion\npeople using the web and by 2017 there were 1.7 billion websites. Modern World History 553\nSince then the number of websites has decreased, dropping by\nnearly 10% per year. And about three quarters of these new\nwebsites aren\u2019t active, but are parked domains or redirects. The\nactual number of sites in active use is probably closer to\n200,000.\nFor people who wanted a presence on the web but didn\u2019t have\nthe skills or interest to own a domain or code a website, what\nsome have called web 2.5 saw the beginning of social networking\nsites. The biggest of these from 2003 to 2008 was called\nMyspace. People could create a profile page, post images and\nmultimedia, and see what their friends were up to. It was much\nless structured than what we\u2019re used to today, allowing users\na lot of flexibility to personalize their pages. Myspace was\novertaken by a service, Facebook, that provided even more ease\nof use and uniformity. Facebook is extremely easy to use, which\nmay be why it has recently become the place for grandparents\nto stalk millennials.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Most of the hardware and software you use was developed\nduring your lifetime. Do you think this has implications for a\n\u201cgeneration gap\u201d between your generation and your parents\u2019\ngeneration?\nThe final element in the story of computing and networks\ninvolves the battle between free, open resources and commerce,\nwhich we\u2019ve already seen in the growth of the web. Operating\nsystems in early mainframes and personal computers were\ntightly controlled by manufacturers like IBM, Digital\nEquipment Company, or Hewlett Packard, software businesses\nlike Microsoft (DOS and Windows), and a number of\nworkstation companies like Sun Microsystems and Silicon\nGraphics, which each owned a proprietary version of an\noperating system that had originally been developed by\nresearchers at AT&T Bell Labs (which was prevented by an anti- 554 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ntrust ruling to get into computers) and the University of\nUniplexed Information\nCalifornia, Berkeley. The\nand Computing Service, called UNIX,\nhad originally been more or less open,\nbut had become commercialized when\nAT&T sold its rights to a network\nsoftware company, Novell, which later\nsold those rights to Santa Cruz\nOperation (SCO). In time, other\norganizations released versions which\nonly ran on their hardware (and often\ncost thousands of dollars), including\nIBM (AIX), Microsoft (Xenix), Sun\nMicrosystems (Solaris), SGI (IRIX) \u2013 all\nproprietary distributions with similar\nfunctionality.\nIn 1991, Finnish graduate\nstudent Linus Torvalds\nbecame frustrated with the\nhigh cost of UNIX. He wrote\nan operating system kernel in\nC, which he planned on\ncalling Freax. Instead, early\nusers called it Linux. The\nopen-source operating\nsystem rapidly gained\npopularity among hackers\ndue to its free distribution\nand its easy configurability. A\nprogrammer could configure\nthe Linux kernel with just the\nfeatures desired, which led to\nLinus Torvalds in 2002\nan explosion of both OS\ndistributions (Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Darwin, Android) as\nwell as uses in embedded systems which were becoming\npopular. PC manufacturers like IBM and Dell adopted Linux as\nan option to reduce the cost of their systems and break Modern World History 555\nMicrosoft\u2019s monopoly on the OS. Linux became especially\npopular for running file servers and internet routers, replacing\nexpensive proprietary systems like IRIX, Microsoft NT, and\nCisco. And organizations like NASA discovered that clusters of\nnetworked off-the-shelf PCs running Linux could rival the\ncomputing power of proprietary supercomputers. Companies\nlike Sun and SGI found the markets for their workstations and\nservers disappearing overnight. Currently all the systems on the\nTop-500 supercomputer list run Linux.\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 How did the development of open source operating systems\nlike Linus change the economics of high tech?\nFifteen years ago, China\nhad no computers on the\nTop-500 list. Today it owns\nthe top two spots. The #2\nmachine, which was the\nworld\u2019s fastest supercomputer\nfrom 2013 to 2016, uses Intel\nXeon CPUs. But in 2015, the\nU.S. government banned the\nTop 500 Supercomputers by country.\nsale of these processors to\nChina. The official reason for the ban was national security\nconcerns, but many suspected a desire to recover the status as\nthe world\u2019s fastest computer for America may have been a\nstrong motivation as well. China responded by very rapidly\nshifting to using its own Sunway CPUs, based on a new\narchitecture and instruction set completed in 2016. The Sunway\nprocessors reportedly have 260 cores and the \u201cTaihulight\u201d\nsupercomputer built from them runs at up to 125.44 petaflops (1\npetaflop = one thousand million million floating point 556 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\noperations per second), a lead the US and Japan are unlikely to\nbe able to catch up with anytime soon.\nAs computing power enables increasingly complex artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems that can control financial trading\nsystems, power grids, and scientific research, the challenges of\nnational technology competitions become apparent. But even\nthe new web technology has its dark side. Social media has been\nimplicated in helping cause the genocide in Myanmar against\nthe minority Rohinga population. Russian meddling and\nmanipulation of Facebook data by a company called Cambridge\nAnalytica may have influenced the 2016 Brexit vote. Foreign\nhacking and social media manipulation were both alleged\nduring the 2016 and 2020 US presidential election, although it\u2019s\nunclear whether the intervention changed the outcome. In the\ncourse of investigating charges of Russian interference, details\nhave come to light of just how compromised social media sites\nlike Facebook have become and how much of their users\u2019 data\nthey hold. And in 2013 American whistleblower Edward\nSnowden released information to journalists showing that\nintelligence agencies such as the NSA and British GCHQ are\nsystematically invading the privacy of citizens in a number of\nillegal ways. As a result of these disclosures, Snowden has been\nforced to live in exile in Russia. It is not clear, however, whether\nthe practices have been discontinued. Modern World History 557\nQuestion for Discussion\n\u2022 Which do you think is a greater threat to the future: foreign\ndomination of high performance computing or the\ngovernment\u2019s invasion of citizen privacy? Why?\nFinally, even when there\u2019s not an adversary regime like Russia\nspreading disinformation, Social Media algorithms create \u201cfilter\nbubbles\u201d in which people only see information that doesn\u2019t\nthreaten their world-views. In an attempt to generate greater\nadvertising revenues, social media platforms and search engines\nroutinely direct users to information that will attract and hold\ntheir attention for the longest time possible. The objective of the\nalgorithms is not necessarily to promote a certain worldview,\nbut simply to keep the user engaged as long as possible so that 558 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmore ads can be placed and sold. However, as a result, users\nare directed to information that conforms with their \u201cprofile\u201d of\nbeliefs and biases. When information that does not conform to\nthe user\u2019s preconceptions is presented, it is often presented in\nan adversarial way, to generate anger (which is another way to\ninsure engagement). News and information are tailored either\nto conform to audiences\u2019 beliefs and prejudices, or to outrage.\nAs time goes on, people on different sides of issues can literally\nfind themselves living in different worlds, basing their beliefs on\ndifferent data, and believing the other side is irrational and evil.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.\nYou can view it online here: https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/\nmodernworldhistory/?p=83\nSome have argued that global media access disproportionately\nbenefits nations like the U.S. which has a multi-billion-dollar\ncontent-creation industry, and that it spreads values some\nsocieties disapprove of, including consumerism and\npornography. Even in the U.S. and the developed world, the\ninternet is changing from the democratic, peer-to-peer sharing\ninstitution it was designed to be, into a platform for commerce Modern World History 559\nand media consumption. In the early days of the internet,\ncommunication was text-based because bandwidths were low.\nThe advent of fiber optic network backbones in the 1990s and\nthe worldwide web created the opportunity to communicate\nusing images and ultimately streaming video. 4G and 5G\ncellular networks allow media to be streamed to smartphones\nand tablets. This rapidly expanding bandwidth created an\nopportunity for the internet to replace broadcast television just\nas it had replaced the analog, landline telephone network. But\naccess may not be universally available for long.\nAs technology exploded, many people expected a renaissance\nof DIY content-creation, and the explosion of websites, blogs,\nvlogs, podcasts, Instas, snapchats and YouTube channels has\ndefinitely expanded the ability of regular people to be heard.\nFive billion YouTube videos are watched daily and 300 hours\nof video are uploaded every minute. On the other hand, more\ncontent is produced for the web by global corporations daily,\nand the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has begun\nto eliminate net neutrality so corporations can buy \u201cfast-lane\u201d\naccess that will turn the web into just another platform for\ncorporate media. The promise of the early internet was that\neven though corporations participated, it was basically a peer-\nto-peer platform. Eliminating net neutrality could potentially\nkill that, unless hackers can come up with a new disruptive\ntechnology that allows the people to stay ahead of the\ncorporations. If corporations can pay to have certain types of 560 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\ndata or media fast-tracked, they can also pay to have other\ntypes of information slow-tracked or even suppressed. Imagine\nif a group with deep pockets and a political agenda could start\nediting what you can see on the internet. Oh wait. Don\u2019t imagine\nit. It\u2019s already happening.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why are \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d a problem?\n\u2022 Do you think technology has led to cultural imperialism?\n\u2022 What is the danger of a loss of network neutrality?\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Panamax_container_ship \u00a9 Williamborg is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 1599px-Pemex_gas_station \u00a9 Magister Mathematicae\nis licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 Hugo_Chavez_in_Brazil-1861 \u00a9 Carlosar is licensed\nunder a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Vladimir_Putin_with_Boris_Yeltsin-3 \u00a9 Kremlin.ru is\nlicensed under a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 WTO. \u00a9 Samhitha Bhat is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Screen Shot 2020-12-28 at 9.29.56 AM \u00a9 Wikipedia is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense\n\u2022 photograph-of-president-william-j-clinton-watching-\nvice-president-albert-gore-b3b7cc-small \u00a9 National\nArchives is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 GEM_corn \u00a9 USDA is licensed under a Public Domain Modern World History 561\nlicense\n\u2022 Maquiladora \u00a9 Guldhammer is licensed under a Public\nDomain license\n\u2022 TPP_enlargement \u00a9 Hanzlan is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 1600px-WTO_protest_sign_(14988892087) \u00a9\nKingofthedead is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Deng_Xiaoping_and_Jimmy_Carter_at_the_arrival_c\neremony_for_the_Vice_Premier_of_China._-\n_NARA_-_183157-restored(cropped) \u00a9 National\nArchives is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 1280px-One-belt-one-road.svg \u00a9 Kjerish is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Enlargement_of_the_European_Union_77 \u00a9 JLogan is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 800px-Anti-\nBrexit,_People\u2019s_Vote_march,_London,_October_19,_\n2019_05 \u00a9 Ilovetheeu is licensed under a CC BY-SA\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 ARPANET_1970_Map \u00a9 UCLA and BBN is licensed\nunder a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 HypertextEditingSystemConsoleBrownUniv1969 \u00a9\nGreg Lloyd is licensed under a CC BY (Attribution)\nlicense\n\u2022 First_Web_Server \u00a9 Coolcaesar is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Internet_map_1024_-_transparent,_inverted \u00a9\nKes\u00e4peruna is licensed under a CC BY (Attribution)\nlicense\n\u2022 Linus_Torvalds \u00a9 Unkonwn is licensed under a CC BY-\nSA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 2880px-\nTOP500_Supercomputers_by_Country_June_2016.sv\ng \u00a9 sim_graph is licensed under a CC BY-SA 562 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n(Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 11534873615_d9ca4e86e1_z \u00a9 Eddie Codel is licensed\nunder a CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution NonCommercial\nShareAlike) license\n\u2022 NN-save-the-internet \u00a9 Joseph Gruber is licensed\nunder a CC BY-ND (Attribution NoDerivatives) license [13]\nLimits to Growth?\nAre human societies able to continue growing forever, or are\nthere limits to the Earth\u2019s carrying capacity?\nOne of the most basic but often overlooked aspects of human\ninteractions with the environment that has come to the\nattention of historians and more recently the public is the\nimpact of population growth and resource scarcity. There are a\nnumber of reasons society prefers to avoid thinking about the\ndanger of having too many humans around. We like people.\nEspecially those who are close to us. And historically, the growth\nof our own particular group has been important for our survival\nand therefore has been desirable. In the past, people haven\u2019t\nalways been too concerned if the success of their particular\ncommunity came at the expense of their neighbors. But\nrecently that neighborhood has expanded to cover the whole\nglobe.\n563 564 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThere\u2019s an economic\nconcept called the zero sum\ngame which says that in many\nsituations, for every winner\nthere has to be a loser.\nEspecially when societies face\nscarcity, attention focuses on\nhow a shrinking or too-small\npie is divided up. Since the\nindustrial revolution though,\nWesterners have been able to\nlive outside of the\nconstrictions of zero sum\nlogic. To a great extent, this\nThomas Robert Malthus, one of the first abundance and sense that the\nphilosophers to concern himself with the pie was growing was based\nquestion of overpopulation\nfirst on the increase in staple\nfoods made available throughout the world by the Columbian\nExchange and the Green Revolution, and also by the harnessing\nof fossil fuels such as coal and oil. But that doesn\u2019t mean\nWesterners have been unaware of the question. At the very\nbeginning of the modern age, an English economist named\nThomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834) published a short book\ncalled An Essay on the Principle of Population. Malthus\u2019s theory,\npublished in 1798, became instantly controversial on both sides\nof the Atlantic. Thomas Jefferson sent a copy of the book to his\nfavorite economist (Jean-Baptiste Say) and asked for an opinion.\nMalthus stated his basic idea like this: \u201cThe increase in\npopulation is necessarily limited by the means of\nsubsistence\u2026the population does invariably increase when the\nmeans of subsistence increase, and \u2026the superior power of\npopulation is repressed and the actual population is kept equal\nto the means of subsistence only by misery and vice.\u201d Another\nway of saying that is, population grows as long as there is food\nand water to support it, and when these resources run out,\npopulation is brought back down through famine, disease, and\nwar. These three causes of depopulation are often termed\n\u201cMalthusian disasters.\u201d Modern World History 565\nThe Malthusian catastrophe simplistically illustrated\nMalthus went on to observe that populations tend to increase\ngeometrically: two people become four, four become eight,\neight become sixteen, etc. In contrast, he said, food supplies at\nbest increase only arithmetically: two bushels of wheat become\nfour, which become six, which become eight. By this logic it is\neasy to see that a society can easily outrun its ability to feed\nitself if the population is not kept down by reducing births\nor increasing deaths, and to understand why early modern\nEuropeans were so obsessed with acquiring new territories to\nimprove their food production abilities.\nThe famines, diseases, and wars of European history gave\nMalthus the examples he needed of the types of crises that\ntended to reduce populations. If society was going to avoid these\nperiodic disasters, he argued, then it would need to find some\nway of limiting the birthrate to avoid starving. The Malthusian\ntheory, as it is called, was intensely controversial right from the\nstart. One of the reasons was that it advocated birth control.\nMalthus himself only called for what he termed \u201cmoral\nrestraint\u201d to help reduce the birth rate, but many Malthusians\nhad more active contraceptive measures in mind. The idea of\nlimiting reproduction was seen by most religious people as a\nviolation of the injunction to \u201cbe fruitful and multiply,\u201d and 566 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\neliminating the risk of pregnancy was seen as an\nencouragement of vice and an invitation to sin. Over two\ncenturies later, we have not left these arguments behind.\nThe other big controversy surrounding Malthusian thought\nwas that it was used by some members of the British upper\nclasses to argue that the conditions of the poor should not be\nimproved. If poor people had higher wages and more to eat,\nthey argued, they would have more children and more of their\nchildren would survive, which would put unnecessary stress on\nthe social system and in the long run lead to mass starvation.\nThe poor simply had to suffer, they said, or society was doomed.\nSome critics accused these upper-class Malthusians of simply\nwanting to hoard more of everything for themselves. But some\nof them sincerely believed that there just wasn\u2019t enough to go\naround, and that adding more hungry mouths wasn\u2019t good for\nthe poor or the rich.\nIt turns out, however, that the assumption held by Malthus\nand those members of the British upper class (and by many\npeople today) that feeding the poor would lead to a population\nexplosion is actually untrue. Population scientists today agree,\nafter studying societies all over the world, that as economic\nsecurity increases, a \u201cdemographic shift\u201d occurs and birth rates\ndecline. In other words, if the poor have enough to eat, infant\nmortality rates and people\u2019s fear of starving in their old age Modern World History 567\ndecrease. Death rates of children decline and as a result parents\nneeding to insure that someone will survive to take care of them\nin their old age have fewer children. Educating women is the\nother major factor demographers have credited with reducing\nbirthrates. Both factors have contributed to a demographic shift\nin the developed world where family sizes have decreased from\nan average of six children per family in the early nineteenth\ncentury to 1.6 in the twentieth. Many developed nations now\nface decreased growth or even shrinkage in their native\npopulations.\nIn spite of the developed world\u2019s success limiting population\ngrowth by providing education for women and a social safety\nnet, the argument is still raging regarding the \u201cdeveloping\nworld.\u201d The Gates Foundation recently started a campaign\ncalled #StopTheMyth. A few years ago Melinda Gates made a\nshort video titled \u201cYou Decide: Save the People or Save the\nPlanet,\u201d claiming that the issue is still very poorly understood.\nGates compared two nations, Afghanistan and Thailand, which\ncurrently have populations of similar size. She pointed out that\nin Afghanistan, where 10% of children die before the age of five,\npopulation is expected to nearly double by 2050. In Thailand,\non the other hand, the number of children dying has decreased\nsubstantially. And so has the birthrate. \u201cClearly,\u201d Gates\nconcluded, \u201cletting children die now so they don\u2019t strain the\nplanet later doesn\u2019t really work. It\u2019s a myth.\u201d 568 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.\nYou can view it online here: https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/\nmodernworldhistory/?p=85\nThe other assumption you may have noticed in the\nMalthusian theory was that food production is expected to\nincrease much more slowly than population. As we have already\nseen, this has not been the experience of the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries. New staple crops from the Americas,\nabundant land, fertilizers, and technology created a global\nGreen Revolution that has allowed us to continually outrun\nMalthus for the last two centuries. But an agricultural scientist\nnamed Karl Sprengel noticed in 1828 that plant growth was\nlimited by the availability of the essential nutrient with the\nlowest concentration. Sprengel\u2019s contemporary, biologist Justus\nvon Liebig, realized this idea had wider applications and\npopularized it as Liebig\u2019s Law, which became a key idea in\necology. The Law states that growth is dictated not by the total\nresources available, but by the scarcest resource, which he called\nthe limiting factor. So the question is, will we be able to keep Modern World History 569\noutrunning Malthus forever, or will a limiting factor end our\nexponential growth?\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why did Malthus worry that overpopulation would lead to\nchaos?\n\u2022 What has prevented a Malthusian catastrophe so far?\n\u2022 Why do you think Melinda Gates felt she needed to set the\nrecord straight on population?\nUntil very recently in human history, the Earth has been so\nbig and the total human population relatively so small, that the\nresources available to us have often seemed infinite. In 1800\nthere were fewer than a billion people on the planet. In 1900\nthere were still less than two billion. By 1960 there were three\nbillion, and in 1999 there were six billion. Current world\npopulation is about 7.7 billion people. During this dramatic\nincrease, there were periods like the early industrial revolution\nwhen worriers like Malthus and his followers expressed doubts\nand anxiety.\nMalthus had no idea that his nation was about to expand its\nempire into Africa and Asia, or that emigration to the Americas\nand Australia would continue to reduce populations at home.\nAnd of course he couldn\u2019t anticipate advances in technology\nor the demographic effects of increasing economic security we\nhave just considered. But sometimes even these advances\nproved temporary or subject to disruption.\nThe population of Ireland boomed in the first decades of the\nnineteenth century, as potatoes increased the calories available\nto poor people and seemed to eliminate the threat of famine.\nThe Irish population peaked at over 8 million in 1841, based\non the potato. About a third of all Irish people ate no other\nsolid food, and lived on a diet of milk and potatoes. Worse, the\nentire nation (indeed all of Europe) grew just a single variety\nof potato, called the Irish Lumper. The blight that attacked this 570 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmonoculture and destroyed potato harvests for several years in\nIreland and throughout Europe killed over a million people and\nforced a million more to flee to America. The Irish population is\nabout 4.8 million today, a little more than half its peak 175 years\nago. As the science of ecology developed in the second half\nof the twentieth century and we began to distinguish between\nrenewable and nonrenewable resources, and to worry about\nthe dangers of depending on monoculture food supplies.\nMalthusian anxiety has returned.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.\nYou can view it online here: https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/\nmodernworldhistory/?p=85\nIn 1968 Stanford University Biology professor Paul R. Ehrlich\npublished a sensational book called The Population Bomb, that\nwas an instant bestseller. It began with the statement, \u201cThe battle\nto feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds of\nmillions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash\nprograms embarked upon now. At this late date, nothing can\nprevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.\u201d Ehrlich\nbecame an instant celebrity and publicized his theories of social Modern World History 571\ncollapse on popular media like Johnny Carson\u2019s Tonight Show.\nEhrlich\u2019s scenarios inspired some great dystopian science\nfiction, but luckily they did not happen in the way Ehrlich had\npredicted. Actually, a couple hundred million people did die of\nhunger in the decades after The Population Bomb was published.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell exactly because when the United Nations\nreported worldwide deaths in the 1970s and 80s, it specifically\nomitted deaths from hunger. But these deaths did not reduce\nworld population overall or result in the social chaos that\nEhrlich had prophesied.\nThe Population Bomb may have done more harm than good\nin the long run, by making worry over the population issue an\neasy target for critics. But people remained concerned about\nthe rapid increase of the world\u2019s human population. In 1972 an\ninternational organization called The Club of Rome published\na study titled The Limits to Growth. Unlike Ehrlich\u2019s sensational\npredictions of doom, The Limits to Growth applied mathematical\nsystems modeling to five particular variables: world population,\nindustrialization, pollution, food production, and natural\nresource depletion. The researchers used newly-available\ncomputer technology to produce a study that illustrated the\ncomplex interactions of these variables by showing three\npotential future outcomes. In two of these scenarios, the global\nsystem experiences what the researchers called \u201covershoot and\ncollapse\u201d in either the middle or toward the end of the twenty-\nfirst century. In the third scenario the computer models arrived\nat what the researchers called a stabilized world system. 572 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nWorld Model Standard Run as shown in The Limits to Growth, which the authors claim\nhas been validated by the data from the last thirty years.\nIn 2008, the original authors of The Limits to Growth returned\nto their models and published a 30-year review of how accurate\ntheir predictions had been. They found that measurements of\nall the variables they had identified were tracking with the\npredictions the computer models had made for an \u201covershoot\nand collapse\u201d scenario. The accuracy of the predictions the\nstudy had made for the short term does not prove their longer-\nterm predictions were accurate, of course. However, the findings\ndo suggest that further study might be in order.\nQuestions for Discussion Modern World History 573\n\u2022 What monocultures do we depend on today that might make\nus vulnerable, similar to the Irish potato situation in the 19th\ncentury?\n\u2022 Why did Paul Ehrlich\u2019s book possibly do more harm than\ngood?\n\u2022 Do you think the possibility of social collapse, even if\nuncertain, is something we should study more closely?\nA bell-shaped production curve, as originally suggested by M. King Hubbert in 1956\nNot all the warnings that humanity is reaching resource limits\nhave come from university academics or international think-\ntanks that are naturally distrusted by regular people and\ncorporate leaders. Marion King Hubbert was an American\ngeophysicist working for Shell Oil in 1956 when he presented\na research paper to an oil industry trade group The American\nPetroleum Institute, where he showed that for any geographical\narea (and by implication, for the planet as a whole), petroleum\nproduction follows a predictable bell-shaped curve. Hubbert\u2019s\ntheory, which became known as Peak Oil, correctly predicted\nthat oil production in the continental US would peak between 574 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\n1965 and 1970, and then begin to decline. Hubbert also\npredicted that world oil production would peak \u201cin about fifty\nyears.\u201d Although the data and especially its interpretation are\nvery controversial, several credible sources suggest that the peak\nin world production happened between 2003 and 2004, right\non Hubbert\u2019s schedule.\nPetrochemical prices can be expected to rise as supplies\ndiminish. Currently, new technologies such as fracking and\nconverting tar sands have added some new sources to the supply\nwe now designate as \u201cpetroleum.\u201d These new additions do not\nrefute the logic of Hubbert\u2019s predictions, although they do\npotentially push back the timing of the supply crunch that we\nwould expect to raise prices. Two elements of The Limits to\nGrowth\u2018s computer mode, industrial production and food\nsupplies, depend heavily on the price of energy, and a third\n(pollution) is an issue for both fracking and tar sands processing.\nA reduction of the supply of oil, an increase in its cost, or\nan increase in pollution could all have a significant negative\nimpacts on those variables.\nHubbert\u2019s words actually echoed Malthus. \u201cOur principal\nconstraints,\u201d he said, \u201care cultural. During the last two centuries\nwe have known nothing but exponential growth, and in parallel\nwe have evolved what amounts to an exponential growth\nculture. Hubbert said our growth culture is \u201cso dependent on\nthe continuation of exponential growth for its stability that it\nis incapable of reckoning with problems of non-growth.\u201d These\nare not the words of some dewy-eyed environmentalist or crazy\nacademic or sensationalist. Hubbert was an oil industry analyst.\nSome have argued that possible future discoveries of more oil\ncould postpone society\u2019s shift to a non-fossil fuel energy\neconomy. But even the oil industry for the most part agrees that\nproduction will decline. So the question we are left with is, how\nquickly will we use up what remains? And, given what we have\nlearned in the last decade about the effect of burning fossil fuels\non the global climate, should we?\nQuestion for Discussion Modern World History 575\n\u2022 What did Hubbert mean by an \u201cexponential growth culture\u201d?\nSome climate activists have\nbegun to suggest that for the\nsake of the environment, we\nought to switch from fossil\nfuels to other energy sources\nas soon as possible and leave\nas much as possible of what is\nleft in the ground. The\nargument against burning the\nrest of the oil (and coal) is that Global surface temperature reconstruction\nover the last millennia using proxy data\nfossil fuels are one of the\nfrom tree rings, corals, and ice cores in\nbiggest contributors of blue. Observational data is from 1880 to\natmospheric carbon that 2019.\nleads to global warming.\nWhile this is true, other factors such as deforestation and even\nagribusiness release comparable amounts of carbon. Simply\nstopping the use of oil will not solve the whole climate change\nproblem, although it is a key element of the change society\nneeds to make to stabilize the global climate. 576 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nBut because energy is such a large part of the economies of\ndeveloped nations, any change is heavily contested. Global\nenergy corporations have an incredible ability to influence\npolitics. A few years ago BP (British Petroleum, established in\n1908 as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and now operating in\n72 countries) issued an \u201cEnergy Outlook\u201d report for the year\n2035. BP claimed that Hubbert\u2019s Peak Oil scenario was actually\nincorrect and announced the company\u2019s intention to burn just\nas much as possible over the next two decades. BP\u2019s claim that\noil production hasn\u2019t peaked, however, depended on redefining\nthe word oil to include both tar sands and biofuels such as\nethanol. Ethanol production depends not only on the energy-\nintensive production of surplus corn and cane sugar (used in\nBrazil as the primary plant source), but in government subsidies\nthat keep the prices of these commodities below their cost of\nproduction. So it\u2019s hard to see how biofuels could legitimately\nbe called a new source of \u201coil.\u201d\nClimate change, more than any other environmental concern,\nhas dominated the attention of Americans in recent years (and\nhas in many cases pushed pollution off the table, which is\nunfortunate). Although the idea that the planet\u2019s climate has\nbeen adversely affected by human activity is very controversial\nin the media, politics, and popular culture, it is almost\nuniversally accepted by scientists. According to NASA, at least Modern World History 577\n97% of climate scientists agree that global warming over the past\ncouple of centuries is due to human activities, or anthropogenic.\nAmerican and international science organizations like the\nAmerican Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological\nSociety, and the American Medical Association, in addition to\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have all gone\na step further, agreeing with the American Physical Society, \u201cWe\nmust reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.\u201d\nPer capita carbon emissions by country. Height = per capita emission; width = size of\npopulation. Color = rate of change.\nOf course who they mean by \u201cwe\u201d is unclear, and the penalties\nfor heeding their warnings are really hard to specify. We often\nhear that \u201cThe forecasts show that it is China, India, and the\nother emerging economies that are increasing their carbon\ndioxide emissions at a speed that will cause dangerous climate\nchange. In fact, China already emits more CO2 than the USA,\nand India already emits more than Germany.\u201d This objection\ncame from a European Union environment minster, speaking at\nthe World Economic Forum at Davos in 2007. The population\nof China is 1.386 billion. India is 1.339 billion, USA 327 million,\nGermany 82.79 million. That means that although China emits\nmore total CO2 than the US, on a per person basis, we still\nemit twice as much (15.7 tons per person to China\u2019s 7.7 tone). 578 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nSimilarly, on a per capita basis, Germany emits more (9.7 tons)\nthan China, and five times more than India (1.8 tons per capita).\nWhile it\u2019s important for China and India to get their carbon\nemissions under control, it is unacceptable for Europe and\nAmerica to try to shift the blame when we still outproduce them\non a per capita basis. Especially since most of the carbon now in\nthe atmosphere was put there by us.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 Why is atmospheric carbon a global rather than a regional or\nnational problem?\n\u2022 Why is it misleading to compare current total carbon\nemissions between countries in trying to assess \u201cblame\u201d?\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. Modern World History 579\nYou can view it online here: https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/\nmodernworldhistory/?p=85\nClimate science is complicated and it can be difficult for some\npeople to understand. And to make matters worse, most\nAmericans share a belief system that distrusts science and\nscientists, because science seems to contradict their most\ncherished religious doctrines about the nature of the world and\ntheir place in it. To make matters even worse, concern over\nclimate change has been identified with a particular political\norientation, with people like former Vice President Al Gore\nseeming to suggest that if people aren\u2019t alarmed by climate\nchange, they\u2019re monsters who don\u2019t love their children. The\nclaim that only liberals care about the environment is not only\nabsurd, but it ignores the traditional meaning of the word\nconservative. In reality, this is not a liberal vs. conservative issue.\nHowever, in addition to the negative reaction many people had\nto the tone of messages like the trailer above, the argument\nagainst recognizing climate change and doing something about\nit has also been carefully managed and funded by political\naction committees and foundations representing corporations\nthat oppose changes in fossil fuel energy policy.\nAlthough 97% of climate scientists agree on anthropogenic 580 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nclimate change, when Americans are asked by pollsters, \u201cDo\nmost scientists believe that the Earth is getting warmer because\nof human activity?\u201d 55% say either \u201cNo\u201d or that they don\u2019t know.\nLess than half of Americans are aware that scientists are\nbasically unanimous on this issue, and thinking that scientists\nare unsure affects their own opinions about climate change and\nthe the government policies they are willing to support to\nmitigate it. A recent study found that most of the public\nstatements against climate change made from 2003 to 2010\ncould be traced to about 91 organizations which received\n$558,000,000 in funding during that period. From 2003 to\n2007 this money was easily traceable to sources such as Exxon-\nMobil and Koch Industries, two corporations opposed to any\nchanges in energy policy.\nWith the changes in foundation funding that followed the\n2008 Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed\ncorporations to hide their political spending, the sources of\nmoney paying for climate change denial have been more\ndifficult to trace. Ultra-free market foundations and even a few\nreligious organizations like the John Templeton Foundation pay\nthe bills of websites like Climatedepot.com that go out of their\nway to label any scientist endorsing climate change a \u201cWarmist\u201d\nwho is probably working for Al Gore in an effort to regulate\nevery aspect of our lives in some big global prison state. Climate\ndeniers warn of the \u201ccommand economies\u201d they claim\nenvironmentalists wish to impose, using language designed to\nrile up libertarians and free market enthusiasts and mobilize\nthem against changing the economy in ways that although they\nwould be very bad for big oil companies, would almost certainly\ncreate millions of new jobs.\nA Recent study found that conservative think tanks funded by\nenergy corporations play a central role in \u201cdenying the reality\nand significance of anthropogenic global warming (AGW),\nespecially by manufacturing uncertainty over climate science.\u201d\nThe conservative think tanks sponsored the publication of 108\nbooks denying climate change through 2010. American think\ntanks have also recently begun funding publishing in foreign\ncountries to spread their message.\nThe study also examined the credentials of the authors and Modern World History 581\neditors of these climate change denial books and found that \u201can\nincreasing portion of denial books are produced by individuals\nwith no scientific training. It appears that at least 90% of denial\nbooks do not undergo peer review, allowing authors or editors\nto recycle scientifically unfounded claims that are then\namplified by the conservative movement, media, and political\nelites.\u201d\nOne deceptive approach is cherry picking data from short time periods to falsely assert\nthat global average temperatures are not rising. Blue trend lines show short-term\ncountertrends that mask longer-term warming trends (red trend lines). Blue dots show\nthe so-called global warming hiatus. 582 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nThis is unfortunate, to say\nthe least. While Germany is\nbecoming a world leader in\nsolar energy deployment, in\nspite of receiving only as\nmuch sunlight as Alaska, and\nwhile Britain is mapping its\nshift to a post-oil based\neconomy with its \u201ctransition\nThe Solar Settlement, a sustainable towns,\u201d many Americans\nhousing community project in Freiburg,\ncontinue wasting their time\nGermany.\narguing over the make-\nbelieve issue of climate change denial. Most economists agree\nthat there are currently more jobs in the renewable energy\nsector than in the fossil fuel sector, and that trend is going to\nincrease. The overall economy would be better off, if we shifted\nto sustainable energy sources and reduced carbon emissions. Of\ncourse, the global petroleum industry would be decimated, so\nthey\u2019re spending their money trying to slow the transition.\nOf nearly 14,000 peer-reviewed climate articles published\nbetween 1991 and 2012, only 24 reject global warming. There\nreally isn\u2019t any doubt that the Earth\u2019s climate is changing in ways\nthat are going to cause serious social disruption in the future.\nWhen political leaders say there is still doubt about the need to\naddress climate change, we should follow the money to discover\nwhy. Our unwillingness or inability to understand the situation\ncauses us to continue being manipulated by organizations\ninterested in maintaining the status quo, and may mean that our\nchoices in the future will be much more limited than they need\nto be.\nQuestions for Discussion\n\u2022 How does politicizing the climate debate make it more\ndifficult to find solutions?\n\u2022 What motivates some organizations to resist the idea that\nhumans have caused global warming?

Some legislative branches have two chambers\u2014for\ninstance, the United States has a Senate in which states have\nequal representation, and a House of Representatives, whose\nmembers are apportioned according to each state\u2019s population.\nBills\u2014proposed laws\u2014need to pass through both chambers.\nThe executive (a president or prime minister on the national\nlevel, or governor on a state level, or mayor on a city level)\nadministers and enforces the laws passed by the executive\nbranch, while generally conducting foreign policy. They select\nmembers of their \u201ccabinet,\u201d usually with the approval of the\nlegislative branch, who are called secretaries of departments\n(like in the U.S.) or ministers of ministries. These individuals\nrun the agencies created by the legislatures to address various\nsocial and economic aspects of society. Foreign policy is mainly\n585 586 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nrun through the chief executive and a foreign minister (the\n\u201cSecretary of the State Department\u201d in the U.S.). Local, state,\nand national executives enforce laws through the police and the\noperation of prisons, while national chief executives are often\nthe commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.\nThe judicial branch is made up of the courts, who interpret\nthe laws, determining whether or not a law has been broken.\nThe highest court (for instance, the Supreme Court in the U.S.)\ndecides whether or not particular laws are \u201cconstitutional,\u201d\nfollowing the foundational law of the country.\nHow Democracies Choose a Chief Executive\nDemocratic countries choose the chief executive through\neither a presidential, parliamentary, or presidential-\nparliamentary system.\nThe Presidential System\nIn the presidential system, citizen voters choose the chief\nexecutive (usually called a \u201cpresident\u201d). In addition to the\nexecutive powers described above, the president can also veto\nlaws passed by the legislative branch, which then usually need\na super-majority (like two-thirds of all members of each\nchamber), to pass the law \u201cover\u201d the presidential veto. This\nsystem originated in its modern form in the U.S. Constitution.\nIt is also common in most Latin American countries.\nThe United States has its own indirect method of choosing a\npresident, which is unique in the world: The Electoral College.\nTechnically, in a presidential election, U.S. voters do not directly\nchoose a presidential candidate, but instead vote for \u201celectors\u201d\nwho are pledged to vote for a certain candidate. The number\nof electors for each state is the number of Senators (always\ntwo) plus the number of Representatives in the House of\nRepresentatives (which is allocated based on population). The\nleast-populated states have a minimum of three electors\n(example: North and South Dakota); the most-populated state\n(California) has 55; Minnesota and Wisconsin each have ten; and\nIowa has seven. Because of this system, it is mathematically\npossible for a candidate to win the popular vote and lose the\nelectoral college vote\u2014most recently, this happened in the\n2000 and 2016 elections.\nNo matter how the president is chosen, the presidential Modern World History 587\nsystem can result in the situation of a president from one\npolitical party and a legislative branch (Congress) led by another\nparty. Because of this \u201cdivided government,\u201d critics point out\nthat it is difficult to legislate, while others claim that it is an\nimportant check on executive power. Recent examples in the\nU.S. include most of the Clinton presidency, the last two years\nof George W. Bush presidency, and most of the Obama\nadministration. In the last two years of the Trump\nadministration, the House of Representatives had a Democratic\nmajority while President Trump was a Republican as were most\nmembers of the Senate.\nAnother potential check on executive power in the\npresidential system is the process of impeachment, in which\nthe legislature can decide to remove a president from office for\ncriminal activity.\nThe Parliamentary System\nIn a parliamentary system, citizens elect the members of the\nlegislative branch (usually called a \u201cparliament\u201d), which then\nchooses the chief executive (usually called the \u201cprime minister\u201d\nbut referred to as the \u201cchancellor\u201d in Germany). In most cases,\nthe legislative branch has only one chamber instead of two.\nThe system originated in Great Britain and is common in\nmany former British colonies (i.e. Australia, Canada, New\nZealand, and Jamaica). Parliamentary systems sometimes\ninclude a monarch involved in the government, but usually as\na figurehead who holds only symbolic power (i.e. Great Britain,\nSpain, Netherlands, and Sweden).\nThe Prime Minister is usually a member of the largest party,\nwhich means that legislation is more easily passed; it is\nimpossible for the executive branch to be controlled by one\nparty and the legislative branch controlled by another, as has\noccurred frequently in the U.S.\nParliament has the right to vote against a prime minister,\nwhich may force a new election. This especially happens in a\nmulti-party system, where a Prime Minister needs the support\nof coalitions of several political parties: if one party decides to\nnot support the Prime Minister, there are new elections.\nPresidential-Parliamentary system: Two chief executives 588 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nIn this system, voters elect both a president and a parliament;\nthe parliament also chooses a prime minister.\nThe system is common in countries that previously had\nmonarchs (Germany, France, Italy, Iraq, and India) but not\nalways (Israel). Like most monarchs, the president in this case\nis frequently just a figurehead who only holds symbolic power,\nbut not always (for instance, in France).\nSometimes the president plays a key role in multi-party\ndemocracies in which the president asks the head of a political\nparty to form a government, usually in coalition with other\nparties. A historical example we discussed earlier was\nGermany\u2019s Weimar Republic. This is how Hitler became\nchancellor. When a parliament votes against a prime minister,\nthe president may ask some other party to form a government\ninstead of calling for new elections.\nVoting Systems in Democracies\nThere are several ways in which elections can be organized in\ndemocracies.\nWinner-take-all\nIn this system, the candidate with the most votes wins,\nmeaning they can win with a plurality rather than a majority\nof votes. It is common in most elections in the United States,\nespecially in choosing members of Congress and in choosing\npresidential electors.\nWinner-take-all usually results in a two-party system, as in\nthe U.S., since voters feel that they are \u201cwasting\u201d their votes\nif they choose a third-party candidate. This often results in\npeople voting against candidates they don\u2019t want rather than\nfor candidates they do. They reason that the candidate they\nactually prefer might take votes away from the \u201clesser-of-two-\nevils\u201d candidate, resulting in a government that they really do\nnot want.\nStill, this voting system may result in candidates winning with\nless than a majority of the vote when there are more than three\nviable candidates (such as the U.S. presidential elections of 1992,\n1996, 2000, and 2016; Minnesota Senate election of 2008;\nMinnesota elections for governor from 1998 through 2010).\nSome criticize this system since voters are limited in their\nchoice of candidates; others argue that the additional system of Modern World History 589\n\u201cprimary elections\u201d\u2014in which voters choose which candidate\nwill represent a party in the \u201cgeneral election\u201d\u2014gives all voices\na chance to be heard.\nProportional Representation\nThis system is only used in legislative elections. In\nproportional representation, voters choose a party; parties are\nassigned their number of seats in a legislature based on the\npercentage of votes that the party wins.\nFictional example: 100 seats in the Minnesota Senate,\nelected statewide by proportional representation\nDemocratic Party: 30%\u201430 seats\nRepublican Party: 35%\u201435 seats\nIndependence Party: 20%\u201420 seats\nGreen Party: 15%\u201415 seats\nProportional representation almost always results in a multi-\nparty system, since voters do not feel that they are \u201cwasting\u201d a\nvote on a third party, since every party wins something (if they\nreach a certain percentage of total votes).\nThe system of choosing who will represent the party varies; it\nmay occur before the elections (parties draw up an ordered list\nof potential representatives) or on the day of the election (voters\nchoose both the party and the individual, so that vote tallies for\nindividuals determine the order of potential representatives).\nIn the fictional case described above, if the Republicans won 35%\nof the vote, the first 35 individuals on their list would win a seat\nin the legislature.\nCombined with a parliamentary or a presidential-\nparliamentary system of government, a multi-party situation\nfrequently means that a prime minister is chosen as part of\na coalition of parties, if no party has a clear majority in the\nlegislature. This is the current situation in Germany, Italy, and\nIsrael.\nFifty Percent Plus One\nCandidates in this system must win at least a simple majority\nof votes (fifty percent plus one); if this does not happen, the top\ntwo vote-winners compete in a second (run-off) election.\nThis system is common in choosing presidents in both the\npresidential and presidential-parliamentary systems (an\nimportant exception is the U.S.). It encourages a multi-party 590 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nsituation, while preventing a candidate from being elected with\nonly a small plurality. This system is used in some\nCongressional elections in the U.S. (Texas currently has this\nsystem). Historical example: Electing the President in the\nWeimar Republic.\nRanked Choice Voting\nA variation of the \u201cfifty percent plus one\u201d system is called\nInstant Run-Off Voting (IRV), where voters rank their first\nchoice, then their second choice, and then their third choice. If\nno candidate receives more than 50% as a first choice, the next\ncount is limited to the top two vote-getters, with the second-\nchoice votes cast by those whose first choice lost added to the\ntop two vote-getters. This system is currently being used in the\nTwin Cities in elections for city council and mayor. [15]\nAppendix B: Finance and Taxes\nBasics of Banking: Lending Money at Interest\nBanks earn a profit by lending money at interest; when\nborrowers pay back what they owe, they also pay the bank\na percent above the amount lent. Borrowers include both\nindividuals who want to purchase homes and consumer goods,\nand businesses which are financing their operations or investing\nin their own expansion.\nTo acquire money to lend, banks do at least two things: attract\ndepositors by guaranteeing to pay them interest on their savings\naccounts; and borrow money from other, larger banks. In most\ncountries, banks can also borrow from a central government-\nrun bank (called the Federal Reserve in the United States). Also,\nin some countries (including the United States), banks make\ninvestments in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments to\nearn higher rates of return.\nWhat is Money Worth?\nLike any commodity\u2014corn, soybeans, cars, shoes\u2014the value\nof any currency is based on supply and demand: high demand\nand low supply raises the value of money, while low demand\nand high supply lowers the value. The trick to remember,\nhowever, is that if there is a high supply and low demand of\na currency\u2014too much money in the money supply\u2014the value\nof money drops, so prices actually go up. The consumer needs\n591 592 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nmore currency to buy things if the market feels that there is too\nmuch of it. This is called inflation.\nUntil the early 1970s, most national currencies were \u201cbacked\u201d\nby gold (and silver); in other words, its \u201cworth\u201d was\ndenominated in metal. Since that time, countries have\ngenerally based the value of their currency on whatever the\ndomestic and international financial markets determine it to be\n(through the concept of supply and demand explained above).\nAlmost always, international finance is denominated in U.S.\ndollars (although the Euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan,\nand the Japanese yen are also important international\ncurrencies).\nAs seen in the example of hyperinflation during the Weimar\nRepublic in Chapter 8, too much money in the money supply\nmay mean that wages chase prices, which in turn chase wages;\ncausing an inflationary spiral with people losing their savings to\nbuy basic food items. However, the example of hyperinflation\nreveals one positive aspect to inflation: it is easier to pay off\ndebts since the new currency is worth less than what was\nborrowed.\nNormal inflation, therefore, can be a good thing, since it can\nencourage borrowing to buy things: what you borrow today\nmay not be worth as much by the time you pay off your loan.\nHowever, defining what is \u201cnormal\u201d inflation, and achieving\nthat level, is the challenge faced by banking systems. Usually\ncentral banks in each country play a key role in determining the\nmoney supply; in the United States, that is the Federal Reserve\nSystem\u2014the \u201cFed.\u201d\nFinancial Concepts in the U.S.: Inflation and the Federal\nReserve System\nThe Federal Reserve System was established in the United\nStates in 1913 during the period of activist government known as\nthe Progressive Era. Other countries already had government-\nrun central banks, and the U.S. had experimented with this\nidea in the 1820s and 1830s, but had abandoned it, relying\nexclusively on the private banking system.\nA few years before the Fed existed, in 1907, a financial crisis\nbroke out, called the \u201cBankers\u2019 Panic.\u201d Banks stopped lending\nto businesses and to each other, fearing that they would not Modern World History 593\nbe paid back, threatening the stability of the U.S. economy.\nHowever, private banking tycoon J.P. Morgan stepped in, lent\nmoney to banks that were on the verge of collapse, and\ninvestors\u2019 confidence in the financial system was restored.\nAfter the panic, many people began thinking that maybe\nhaving the entire U.S. banking system dependent on a single\nprivate citizen was a bad idea, and that the U.S. should adopt the\n\u201ccentral bank\u201d concept from other countries. Thus, the Fed was\norganized. There are checks and balances involved: members\nof the Federal Reserve board and its chair are appointed by the\nU.S. President for set terms of office; and their appointments\nneed to be approved by the Senate.\nInterest Rates, Banks, and Lending\nThe Fed lends money to banks at interest, which then lend\nto each other and to the rest of the economy at a higher rate\nof interest. The interest rate banks use to lend to each other\nis called the prime rate. It is usually three percentage points\nabove the Fed\u2019s interest rate to the banks. For example, if the\nFed\u2019s rate is 1%, then the prime rate is 4%. Banks make profits by\nlending money at interest\u2014but they have to also pay back the\nFed.\nThe banks that borrow from other banks establish a higher\ninterest rate than the prime rate for loans to businesses and\npersonal borrowers. Borrowers are typically required to pay\nback at least the monthly interest rate plus a bit of \u201cprinciple\u201d\n(the original amount borrowed).\nThe bank\u2019s rate may fluctuate for individual borrowers based\non how much confidence a bank has that they will be paid back.\nThis decision is based on a \u201ccredit rating\u201d which is established\nby private companies like Standard and Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s.\nThe credit rating is measured by determining previous\nborrowing history and how well a borrower reliably pays back\ntheir loans (including on credit cards). Banks also consider\nother factors, for both individuals and businesses, such as\nsavings and other investments, before lending money.\nIf a bank or other lending institution has less confidence in\na borrower, they will charge a higher interest rate. This means\nthe borrower would have to make higher required monthly\npayments\u2014the reasoning is that if they borrower eventually 594 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nstops making payments, at least more of the debt will be paid off\nto the bank up front.\nControlling the Money Supply: The Fed\u2019s Interest Rate and Monetary\nPolicy\nAs mentioned, the Federal Reserve plays an important role\nin determining interest rates. It uses this power to establish a\nhealthy rate of inflation or to help stimulate the economy.\nConsider the following problems and their solutions:\nProblem\u2014High inflation. Solution\u2014Fed raises\ninterest rates.\nIf the Fed\u2019s rate goes up, the prime rate goes up and\nbanks, businesses, and consumers borrow less and buy\nless because borrowing gets too expensive. This means\nless money in the money supply, which controls\ninflation. However, high interest rates may also slow\ndown the economy because businesses will invest less\nand consumers will not buy as much.\nProblem\u2014Slow economic growth or a recession.\nSolution\u2014Fed lowers interest rates.\nIf the interest rate goes down, banks, businesses, and\nconsumers borrow more and buy more. This stimulates\nthe economy. However, lower interest rates may lead\nto inflation\u2014more money in the money supply\u2014or to\ninvestors taking too many risks (the fundamental\nproblem behind the 2008 Financial Crisis).\nThe Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy, 1979-Today\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, when there was a recession\nwith over 10% inflation and high unemployment, the Fed raised\ninterest rates and the prime rate went up to control inflation.\nAt the time, banks actually competed with prizes and other\nincentives to attract depositors, including establishing high rates\nof interest on savings accounts. People spent less and saved\nmore, which also affected the money supply. The policy also\ndeepened the recession, in the short run.\nAfter the crisis began to fade, the Fed gradually lowered\ninterest rates, just in time for the huge technology boom of the Modern World History 595\n1990s. New companies borrowed more at low interest rates.\nHowever, when the tech boom slowed down around 1999, the\nFed lowered interest rates even more to stimulate the economy.\nThis policy led to increased borrowing to buy real estate, which\nindirectly led to the 2008 Financial Crisis.\nSince 2008, the prime rate has been very low, sometimes\nbarely above 0%, in order to stimulate economic growth. In the\nU.S., the recovery was gradual but sustained\u2014jobs were added\nto the economy for every month from mid-2009 until the\nbeginning of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.\nThe Fed and Quantitative Easing: Another Tool in the Toolbox\nAt the beginning of the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Fed also\nbegan a policy of \u201cquantitative easing.\u201d This means that the\nFed buys bank debt\u2014what banks borrow from the Fed or other\nbanks\u2014so that banks can lend money instead of using it to\npay off their own debts. This also stimulates the economy by\nencouraging more lending.\nThe Fed Compared to Other Central Banks: No \u201cSovereign Funds\u201d\nUnlike other central banks\u2014for instance, those of China and\nJapan\u2014the Fed does not make investments. In the case of China\nand Japan and other countries, central banks maintain\n\u201csovereign funds\u201d by buying investments in their own countries,\nor in others. In this way, these sovereign funds purchase U.S.\ngovernment debt by buying U.S. bonds (see below).\nTaxes, Government Borrowing and the World Economy\nTaxes and Government Revenue\nTaxes pay for government services (military, police, prisons,\neducation, infrastructure, Social Security, etc.), but there are\nseveral different kinds of taxes. For instance in the United States,\nthe U.S. federal government raises revenue by taxing\u2014taking\na percentage\u2014of individual income and corporate earnings.\nThe federal government also raises revenue through some sales\ntaxes, especially on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco. Customs and\ntariffs (taxes on foreign imports) are still around but are a lot less\nimportant than they were in the nineteenth century as a source\nof revenue.\nState governments in the U.S. are more likely to raise revenue\nthrough sales taxes and fees for certain government services\n(license plates, hunting licenses, etc.) Sales taxes are a 596 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\npercentage of the purchase price of consumer goods, but not\nall goods are taxed (for instance, Minnesota is unique in that\nthe state does not levy a sales tax on clothing). Most, but not\nall, states also have taxes on personal income and corporate\nearnings.\nMunicipal governments in the U.S. usually collect property\ntaxes (and, in some cities, sales taxes) to raise revenue. Property\ntaxes are based on the value of real estate held by an individual\nor corporation.\nSchool taxes in the U.S. are also almost always property taxes,\nwhich explains why rich suburban school districts can provide\nbetter public schools than poor urban and rural districts.\nThe Tax Debate: \u201cTax and Spend\u201d vs. \u201cTrickle Down\u201d\n\u201cTax and Spend\u201d: Classic Keynesian economics. Advocates of\nthis perspective argue that government projects and services\nhelp build the country\u2019s future (infrastructure, education,\naffordable housing, etc.) while providing jobs, especially during\nhard economic times. (Most Democrats agree with this idea to a\ndegree).\n\u201cTrickle Down\u201d: Cut taxes as much as possible. Those who\npromote this theory believe that individuals and businesses\nshould have more money to spend any way they wish.\nConsumers will stimulate the market through personal\nspending, while businesses will reinvest and help grow the\neconomy. This will create more government revenue as new\nworkers and growing businesses are paying taxes. (Most\nRepublicans agree with this theory to a degree).\nGovernment Borrowing: Selling Bonds\nGovernments at every level and all over the world borrow\nmoney by selling bonds to finance spending on projects and\nservices. Bondholders are paid interest on bonds, but, like\nstocks, may also resell them to other investors. Government\nbonds are paid with revenue (through taxes) gradually over\nyears, spreading the debt to the next generations. This makes\nsome sense: Why should current taxpayers pay completely for\na new bridge, school, or public park which will be used by\neveryone for decades to come? Spreading the debt is seen as\nfairer.\nUnited States federal Treasury Bonds are sold around the Modern World History 597\nworld to individuals, banks, and global sovereign funds (the\ngovernment banks of China, Japan, and many others). The U.S.\ngovernment has consistently made payments on its bonds for\nover two centuries and so U.S. bonds are considered globally as\nthe best and safest investment\u2013they are purchased even if they\nare being sold at almost no interest (which has been the case for\nmost of the last 12 years).\nCongress determines the maximum debt the U.S. government\ncan maintain through bonds, called the \u201cDebt Ceiling.\u201d The\ndebate about whether or not to raise the debt ceiling is similar\nto the tax debate: some, especially among Democrats, advocate\nissuing bonds to invest in America\u2019s future, especially while\ninterest rates are low. Others, particularly among Republicans,\nfeel that the government should not burden future generations\nwith more government debt. Like determining the best rate of\ninflation, the proper prime rate for an economy, and the level\nof taxation, economists and politicians also debate about how\nmuch government debt is too much.\nConfidence in Government Debt\nAn important consideration for investors interested in buying\ngovernment bonds is the confidence in a government\u2019s ability\nto pay its debt. Just like individuals and businesses, as long\nas a government continues to pay its debt completely and on\ntime, then banks will lend more money to the government,\nadjusting the interest rate based on their level of confidence.\nEven countries have credit scores from rating agencies to help\nlenders and investors make decisions.\nHowever, unlike individuals, governments never completely\npay off debt, but that is less important than their ability to\nborrow based on how well they keep up on payments. For\ninstance, Germany did not finish paying all reparations from\nWorld War One until 2010, yet this fact had little effect on its\neconomy, which has consistently been among the world\u2019s top\nthree for decades.\nIf a nation\u2019s economy collapses or some other disaster\nhappens, or the debt gets too big (and again, there is a lot of\ndebate over what \u201ctoo big\u201d is), then investors will have less\nconfidence and a government will be unable to sell bonds and\nborrow money. This has happened not only to countries but 598 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford\nalso U.S. territories, most recently Detroit and Puerto Rico.\nThe debt payments are restructured by the lenders, or reneged\nupon entirely, with future borrowing greatly affected because of\nthe lack of confidence by investors and lenders. Sometimes a\ngovernment built infrastructure that did not end up stimulating\neconomic growth; other times, they did not foresee huge\nchanges\u2014like a population leaving a city for the suburbs. And\nsometimes, especially in certain developing nations, corrupt\npoliticians and administrators robbed the funds, saddling a\ngovernment with debt but leaving nothing of value."
