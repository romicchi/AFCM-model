Indeed, by 2030 when the last of the Baby\nBoomers reach age 65, the U.S. older population\nwill be double that of 2010. Furthermore, because\nof increases in average life expectancy, each new\ngeneration can expect to live longer than their\nparents\u2019 generation and certainly longer than their\ngrandparents\u2019 generation. As a consequence, it is\ntime for individuals of all ages to rethink their\npersonal life plans and consider prospects for a\nlong life. When is the best time to start a family?\nWill the education gained up to age 20 be\nsu\u0000cient to cope with future technological\nadvances and marketplace needs? What is the\nright balance between work, family, and leisure\nthroughout life? What's the best age to retire? How\ncan I age successfully and enjoy life to the fullest\nDue to positive health trends the population of older adults is\nwhen I'm 80 or 90? In this module we will discuss\nincreasing steadily. Understanding the psychology of aging will be\nseveral di\u0000erent domains of psychological\nmore important than ever to support this group and help them\nresearch on aging that will help answer these\nthrive.

In each decade of adulthood,\nwe observe substantial heterogeneity in cognitive functioning, personality, social relationships, lifestyle, beliefs,\nand satisfaction with life. This heterogeneity re\u0000ects di\u0000erences in rates of biogenetic and psychological aging and\nthe sociocultural contexts and history of people's lives (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Fingerman, Berg, Smith, &\nAntonucci, 2011). Theories of aging describe how these multiple factors interact and change over time. They\ndescribe why functioning di\u0000ers on average between young, middle-aged, young-old, and very old adults and why\nthere is heterogeneity within these age groups. Life course theories, for example, highlight the e\u0000ects of social\nexpectations and the normative timing of life events and social roles (e.g., becoming a parent, retirement). They\nalso consider the lifelong cumulative e\u0000ects of membership in speci\u0000c cohorts (generations) and sociocultural\nsubgroups (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic status) and exposure to historical events (e.g., war, revolution,\nnatural disasters; Elder, Johnson, & Crosnoe, 2003; Settersten, 2005). Life span theories complement the life-\ncourse perspective with a greater focus on processes within the individual (e.g., the aging brain). This approach\nemphasizes the patterning of lifelong intra- and inter-individual di\u0000erences in the shape (gain, maintenance,\nloss), level, and rate of change (Baltes, 1987, 1997). Both life course and life span researchers generally rely on\nlongitudinal studies to examine hypotheses about di\u0000erent patterns of aging associated with the e\u0000ects of\nbiogenetic, life history, social, and personal factors. Cross-sectional studies provide information about age-group\ndi\u0000erences, but these are confounded with cohort, time of study, and historical e\u0000ects.\nCognitive Aging\nResearchers have identi\u0000ed areas of both losses and gains in cognition in older age. Cognitive ability and\nintelligence are often measured using standardized tests and validated measures. The psychometric approach\nhas identi\u0000ed two categories of intelligence that show di\u0000erent rates of change across the life span (Schaie &\nWillis, 1996). Fluid intelligence refers to information processing abilities, such as logical reasoning, remembering\nlists, spatial ability, and reaction time. Crystallized intelligence encompasses abilities that draw upon experience\nand knowledge. Measures of crystallized intelligence include vocabulary tests, solving number problems, and\nunderstanding texts.\nWith age, systematic declines are observed on\ncognitive tasks requiring self-initiated, e\u0000ortful\nprocessing, without the aid of supportive memory\ncues (Park, 2000). Older adults tend to perform poorer\nthan young adults on memory tasks that involve recall\nof information, where individuals must retrieve\ninformation they learned previously without the help\nof a list of possible choices. For example, older adults\nmay have more di\u0000culty recalling facts such as names\nor contextual details about where or when something\nhappened (Craik, 2000). What might explain these\nde\u0000cits as we age? As we age, working memory, or\nour ability to simultaneously store and use\ninformation, becomes less e\u0000cient (Craik & Bialystok,\n2006). The ability to process information quickly also\ndecreases with age. This slowing of processing speed\nThere are many stereotypes of older adults. They are\nmay explain age di\u0000erences on many di\u0000erent\nsometimes seen as slow because of changes in cognitive\ncognitive tasks (Salthouse, 2004). Some researchers\nprocessing speed.

Finally, it is\nwell established that our hearing and vision decline as\nwe age. Longitudinal research has proposed that\nde\u0000cits in sensory functioning explain age di\u0000erences in a variety of cognitive abilities (Baltes & Lindenberger,\n1997).\nFewer age di\u0000erences are observed when memory cues are available, such as for recognition memory tasks, or\nwhen individuals can draw upon acquired knowledge or experience. For example, older adults often perform as\nwell if not better than young adults on tests of word knowledge or vocabulary. With age often comes expertise,\nand research has pointed to areas where aging experts perform as well or better than younger individuals. For\nexample, older typists were found to compensate for age-related declines in speed by looking farther ahead at\nprinted text (Salthouse, 1984). Compared to younger players, older chess experts are able to focus on a smaller\nset of possible moves, leading to greater cognitive e\u0000ciency (Charness, 1981). Accrued knowledge of everyday\ntasks, such as grocery prices, can help older adults to make better decisions than young adults (Tentori, Osheron,\nHasher, & May, 2001).\nHow do changes or maintenance of cognitive ability a\u0000ect older adults\u2019 everyday lives? Researchers have studied\ncognition in the context of several di\u0000erent everyday activities. One example is driving. Although older adults\noften have more years of driving experience, cognitive declines related to reaction time or attentional processes\nmay pose limitations under certain circumstances (Park & Gutchess, 2000). Research on interpersonal problem\nsolving suggested that older adults use more e\u0000ective strategies than younger adults to navigate through social\nand emotional problems (Blanchard-Fields, 2007). In the context of work, researchers rarely \u0000nd that older\nindividuals perform poorer on the job (Park & Gutchess, 2000). Similar to everyday problem solving, older workers\nmay develop more e\u0000cient strategies and rely on expertise to compensate for cognitive decline.\nPersonality and Self-Related Processes\nResearch on adult personality examines normative age-related increases and decreases in the expression of the\nso-called \"Big Five\" traits\u2014extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to new\nexperience. Does personality change throughout adulthood? Previously the answer was no, but contemporary\nresearch shows that although some people\u2019s personalities are relatively stable over time, others\u2019 are not (Lucas &\nDonnellan, 2011; Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). Longitudinal studies reveal average changes during adulthood in the\nexpression of some traits (e.g., neuroticism and openness decrease with age and conscientiousness increases)\nand individual di\u0000erences in these patterns due to idiosyncratic life events (e.g., divorce, illness). Longitudinal\nresearch also suggests that adult personality traits, such as conscientiousness, predict important life outcomes\nincluding job success, health, and longevity (Friedman, Tucker, Tomlinson-Keasey, Schwartz, Wingard, & Criqui,\n1993; Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007).\nIn contrast to the relative stability of personality traits, theories about the aging self-propose changes in self-\nrelated knowledge, beliefs, and autobiographical narratives. Responses to questions such as \u201cTell me something\nabout yourself. Who are you?\u201d \"What are your hopes for the future?\" provide insight into the characteristics and\nlife themes that an individual considers uniquely distinguish him or herself from others. These self-descriptions\nenhance self-esteem and guide behavior (Markus & Nurius, 1986; McAdams, 2006). Theory suggests that as we\nage, themes that were relatively unimportant in young and middle adulthood gain in salience (e.g., generativity,\nhealth) and that people view themselves as improving over time (Ross & Wilson, 2003). Reorganizing personal life\nnarratives and self-descriptions are the major tasks of midlife and young-old age due to transformations in\nprofessional and family roles and obligations. In advanced old age, self-descriptions are often characterized by a\nlife review and re\u0000ections about having lived a long life. Birren and Schroots (2006), for example, found the\nprocess of life review in late life helped individuals confront and cope with the challenges of old age.\nOne aspect of the self that particularly interests\nlife span and life course psychologists is the\nindividual\u2019s perception and evaluation of their\nown aging and identi\u0000cation with an age group.\nSubjective age is a multidimensional construct\nthat indicates how old (or young) a person feels\nand into which age group a person categorizes\nhim- or herself. After early adulthood, most\npeople say that they feel younger than their\nchronological age and the gap between subjective\nage and actual age generally increases. On\naverage, after age 40 people report feeling 20%\nyounger than their actual age (e.g., Rubin &\nBerntsen, 2006). Asking people how satis\u0000ed they\nare with their own aging assesses an evaluative\ncomponent of age identity. Whereas some\naspects of age identity are positively valued (e.g.,\nThere is a di\u0000erence between physical age and subjective age as\nacquiring seniority in a profession or becoming a\nsummarized in the saying \"You are only as old as you feel.\" [Image:\ngrandparent), others may be less valued,\nEmar, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/HEXbAA]\ndepending on societal context. Perceived physical\nage (i.e., the age one looks in a mirror) is one\naspect that requires considerable self-related\nadaptation in social and cultural contexts that value young bodies. Feeling younger and being satis\u0000ed with one\u2019s\nown aging are expressions of positive self-perceptions of aging. They re\u0000ect the operation of self-related\nprocesses that enhance well-being. Levy (2009) found that older individuals who are able to adapt to and accept\nchanges in their appearance and physical capacity in a positive way report higher well-being, have better health,\nand live longer.\nSocial Relationships\nSocial ties to family, friends, mentors, and peers are primary resources of information, support, and comfort.\nIndividuals develop and age together with family and friends and interact with others in the community. Across\nthe life course, social ties are accumulated, lost, and transformed. Already in early life, there are multiple sources\nof heterogeneity in the characteristics of each person's social network of relationships (e.g., size, composition,\nand quality). Life course and life span theories and research about age-related patterns in social relationships\nfocus on understanding changes in the processes underlying social connections. Antonucci's Convoy Model of\nSocial Relations (2001; Kahn & Antonucci, 1980), for example, suggests that the social connections that people\naccumulate are held together by exchanges in social support (e.g., tangible and emotional). The frequency, types,\nand reciprocity of the exchanges change with age and in response to need, and in turn, these exchanges impact\nthe health and well-being of the givers and receivers in the convoy. In many relationships, it is not the actual\nobjective exchange of support that is critical but instead the perception that support is available if needed\n(Uchino, 2009). Carstensen\u2019s Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (1993; Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999)\nfocuses on changes in motivation for actively seeking social contact with others. She proposes that with\nincreasing age our motivational goals change from information gathering to emotion regulation. To optimize the\nexperience of positive a\u0000ect, older adults actively restrict their social life to prioritize time spent with emotionally\nclose signi\u0000cant others. In line with this, older marriages are found to be characterized by enhanced positive and\nreduced negative interactions and older partners show more a\u0000ectionate behavior during con\u0000ict discussions\nthan do middle-aged partners (Carstensen, Gottman, & Levenson, 1995). Research showing that older adults have\nsmaller networks compared to young adults and tend to avoid negative interactions also supports this theory.\nSimilar selective processes are also observed when time horizons for interactions with close partners shrink\ntemporarily for young adults (e.g., impending geographical separations).\nMuch research focuses on the associations between speci\u0000c e\u0000ects of long-term social relationships and health in\nlater life. Older married individuals who receive positive social and emotional support from their partner\ngenerally report better health than their unmarried peers (Antonucci, 2001; Umberson, Williams, Powers, Liu, &\nNeedham, 2006; Waite & Gallagher, 2000). Despite the overall positive health e\u0000ects of being married in old age\n(compared with being widowed, divorced, or single), living as a couple can have a \"dark side\" if the relationship is\nstrained or if one partner is the primary caregiver. The consequences of positive and negative aspects of\nrelationships are complex (Birditt & Antonucci, 2008; Rook, 1998; Uchino, 2009). For example, in some\ncircumstances, criticism from a partner may be perceived as valid and useful feedback whereas in others it is\nconsidered unwarranted and hurtful. In long-term relationships, habitual negative exchanges might have\ndiminished e\u0000ects. Parent-child and sibling relationships are often the most long-term and emotion-laden social\nties. Across the life span, the parent-child tie, for example, is characterized by a paradox of solidarity, con\u0000ict, and\nambivalence (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, & Lefkowitz, 2006).\nEmotion and Well-being\nAs we get older, the likelihood of losing loved ones or experiencing declines in health increases. Does the\nexperience of such losses result in decreases in well-being in older adulthood? Researchers have found that well-\nbeing di\u0000ers across the life span and that the patterns of these di\u0000erences depend on how well-being is\nmeasured.\nMeasures of global subjective well-being assess individuals\u2019 overall perceptions of their lives. This can include\nquestions about life satisfaction or judgments of whether individuals are currently living the best life possible.\nWhat factors may contribute to how people respond to these questions? Age, health, personality, social support,\nand life experiences have been shown to in\u0000uence judgments of global well-being. It is important to note that\npredictors of well-being may change as we age. What is important to life satisfaction in young adulthood can be\ndi\u0000erent in later adulthood (George, 2010). Early research on well-being argued that life events such as marriage\nor divorce can temporarily in\u0000uence well-being, but people quickly adapt and return to a neutral baseline (called\nthe hedonic treadmill; Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006). More recent research suggests otherwise. Using\nlongitudinal data, researchers have examined well-being prior to, during, and after major life events such as\nwidowhood, marriage, and unemployment (Lucas, 2007). Di\u0000erent life events in\u0000uence well-being in di\u0000erent\nways, and individuals do not often adapt back to baseline levels of well-being. The in\u0000uence of events, such as\nunemployment, may have a lasting negative in\u0000uence on well-being as people age. Research suggests that global\nwell-being is highest in early and later adulthood and lowest in midlife (Stone, Schwartz, Broderick, & Deaton,\n2010).\nHedonic well-being refers to the emotional component of well-being and includes measures of positive (e.g.,\nhappiness, contentment) and negative a\u0000ect (e.g., stress, sadness). The pattern of positive a\u0000ect across the adult\nlife span is similar to that of global well-being, with experiences of positive emotions such as happiness and\nenjoyment being highest in young and older adulthood. Experiences of negative a\u0000ect, particularly stress and\nanger, tend to decrease with age. Experiences of sadness are lowest in early and later adulthood compared to\nmidlife (Stone et al., 2010). Other research \u0000nds that older adults report more positive and less negative a\u0000ect\nthan middle age and younger adults (Magai, 2008; Mroczek, 2001). It should be noted that both global well-being\nand positive a\u0000ect tend to taper o\u0000 during late older adulthood and these declines may be accounted for by\nincreases in health-related losses during these years (Charles & Carstensen, 2010).\nPsychological well-being aims to evaluate the positive aspects of psychosocial development, as opposed to factors\nof ill-being, such as depression or anxiety. Ry\u0000\u2019s model of psychological well-being proposes six core dimensions\nof positive well-being. Older adults tend to report higher environmental mastery (feelings of competence and\ncontrol in managing everyday life) and autonomy (independence), lower personal growth and purpose in life, and\nsimilar levels of positive relations with others as younger individuals (Ry\u0000, 1995). Links between health and\ninterpersonal \u0000ourishing, or having high-quality connections with others, may be important in understanding how\nto optimize quality of life in old age (Ry\u0000 & Singer, 2000).\nSuccessful Aging and Longevity\nIncreases in average life expectancy in the 20th\ncentury and evidence from twin studies that\nsuggests that genes account for only 25% of the\nvariance in human life spans have opened new\nquestions about implications for individuals and\nsociety (Christensen, Doblhammer, Rau, & Vaupel,\n2009). What environmental and behavioral factors\ncontribute to a healthy long life? Is it possible to\nintervene to slow processes of aging or to\nminimize cognitive decline, prevent dementia, and\nensure life quality at the end of life (Fratiglioni,\nPaillard-Borg, & Winblad, 2004; Hertzog, Kramer,\nWilson, & Lindenberger, 2009; Lang, Baltes, &\nWagner, 2007)? Should interventions focus on late\nlife, midlife, or indeed begin in early life?\nSuggestions that pathological change (e.g.,\ndementia) is not an inevitable component of aging\nPhysical activity is one of the pillars of successful aging. [Image:\nand that pathology could at least be delayed until\nWilliam Murphy, https://goo.gl/Khsbsb, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nthe very end of life led to theories about\nhttps://goo.gl/jSSrcO]\nsuccessful aging and proposals about targets for\nintervention. Rowe and Kahn (1997) de\u0000ned three\ncriteria of successful aging: (a) the relative\navoidance of disease, disability, and risk factors like high blood pressure, smoking, or obesity; (b) the maintenance\nof high physical and cognitive functioning; and (c) active engagement in social and productive activities. Although\nsuch de\u0000nitions of successful aging are value-laden, research and behavioral interventions have subsequently\nbeen guided by this model. For example, research has suggested that age-related declines in cognitive\nfunctioning across the adult life span may be slowed through physical exercise and lifestyle interventions (Kramer\n& Erickson, 2007). It is recognized, however, that societal and environmental factors also play a role and that\nthere is much room for social change and technical innovation to accommodate the needs of the Baby Boomers\nand later generations as they age in the next decades.\nOutside Resources\nWeb: Columbia Aging Society\nhttp://www.agingsocietynetwork.org/\nWeb: Columbia International Longevity Center\nhttp://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/international-longevity-\ncenter-knowledge-transfer\nWeb: National Institute on Aging\nhttp://www.nia.nih.gov/\nWeb: Stanford Center Longevity\nhttp://longevity3.stanford.edu/\nDiscussion Questions\n1.
