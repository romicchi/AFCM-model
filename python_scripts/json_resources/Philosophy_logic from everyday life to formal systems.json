Different Ways to Use Language\nWhen we use words to communicate, we are not always trying to say something that is either\ntrue or false. When a person, for instance, says, \u201cPlease pass me that paper,\u201d he or she has not\nsaid anything that is true or false. Rather, that person has made a request that will either be\ngranted or not granted. Likewise, when a mother tells her child, \u201cAlways hold an adults\u2019 hand\nwhen you go across the street,\u201d she has not said anything that is true or false. Rather, she has\nissued a command. If someone asks, \u201cSir, where is the White House located?,\u201d that individual\nhas not made an assertion about any state of affairs, but has asked a question. There are many\nuses that language can be put to: making requests, issuing commands, asking questions, and\nexpressing emotion. Making assertions that are either true or false is only one of them. It is that\nparticular usage that we are most concerned with in logic.\nA proposition is a description of some state of affairs that is either true or false. One way of\ndetermining whether a proposition is true is to actually observe the state of affairs it describes\nand see if that state of affairs corresponds to the description given. For instance, if someone\ndeclares that it is raining outside, one way of determining if this is actually true is to look outside\nand see if rain is falling. If rain is falling, then the proposition, \"It is raining outside\" is true. If\nrain is not falling, then the proposition is false.\nHowever, we do not always use direct observation in order to decide whether a proposition is\ntrue or false. Often, we infer the truth or falsity of a proposition. Although we might not be able\nto see or hear what is going on outside, if someone enters from outside wearing a wet raincoat\nand is carrying a wet umbrella, we would normally conclude that the proposition, \"It is raining\noutside\" is true. Logic is concerned with how we reason from certain propositions accepted as\ntrue (e.g., Jones has just entered from outside wearing a wet raincoat and carrying a wet\numbrella) to different propositions not otherwise known to be true (e.g., It is raining outside.) In\neveryday life and in formal systems, logic is the study of the forms of correct inference.\ni Although we might infer the truth of the proposition, \"It is raining outside\u201d, from the wet\nraincoat and wet umbrella, normally we could still establish its truth or falsity independently by\nsimply walking outside. But this kind of direct observation is not always possible. Suppose, for\ninstance, that the safe in Jones' house has been robbed and we suspect Brown. Since the robbery\nhas already taken place, it is not possible to directly observe who committed the robbery. The\nactual commission of the robbery is a historical fact no longer available to direct observation.\nThis, however, does not mean that it is impossible to determine the truth as to whether Brown\ncommitted the robbery. It merely means that establishing who committed the robbery by direct\nobservation is impossible. But by using logic, it is possible to infer whether or not Brown\ncommitted the robbery.\nSuppose the police are called and they find fresh fingerprints on the safe. If those fingerprints\nmatch fingerprints previously taken from Brown's hands, then, it is reasonable for them to\nconclude that Brown robbed the safe. In court, the prosecutor could argue from the fact that\nBrown's fingerprints were on the safe (and other facts, e.g., that Brown had no witnesses to\nestablish where he was at the time of the robbery, and that Brown had a history of robberies) to\nthe conclusion that Brown robbed the safe in Jones' house. Brown's defense attorney, on the\nother hand, could present arguments to show that Brown's fingerprints on the safe were not\nsufficient evidence to conclude that Brown had robbed the safe. For example, what if Brown\nmay have accidentally touched the safe while cleaning around it? What if Brown, with Jones\u2019\npermission, had recently looked inside the safe at a rare coin?\nIt is only because human beings are able to make logical inferences that we are able to know so\nmany things to be true without direct experience of what is described. History and science would\nbe impossible without logic. No human being has traveled from the earth to the sun. Yet, we\nknow that the distance from the earth to the sun is approximately 93,000,000 miles. No\nthermometer has ever been placed at the interior of the earth. Yet, we know that the temperature\nof the earth's core is approximately 4,000 degrees centigrade. Such facts are known, not from\ndirect experience of the situations described, but by inference from other facts already accepted\nas true.\nii We depend on inferences not only in academic disciplines such as history and science, but in our\neveryday personal interactions with one another. We make inferences whenever we form an\nopinion about a person's intentions based on his or her actions. We do not directly observe other\npeoples intentions. Rather, a person\u2019s intentions are inferred from what we do observe. A\ncommon source of misunderstanding is the failure to appreciate that, while we may observe what\na person does, we do not observe the person's intentions.\nB. Rationality\nEvery situation is open to multiple interpretations depending on the perspective from which it is\nviewed. In order to know what a person's intentions are, it is necessary to see that person's\nactions from that person's point of view. When we ask a person why he or she is doing\nsomething, we are asking that person to express in words the assumptions which give meaning to\nwhat that person is doing. We are, in short, asking for an explanation of his or her actions.\nBeing rational means accepting the responsibility of putting actions and situations into a\nframework that others can use to understand those actions and situations. Since different people\nmay interpret the same action or situation in different ways, each must attempt to communicate\nto the other the different assumptions he or she brings to bear on the case at hand. One is rational\nto the extent that one is committed to maintaining and strengthening one\u2019s relationship with\nothers through the exchange of information and different points of view.\nWhen a person communicates to others the framework within which he or she is acting, then\nothers are able to understand what that person is doing. This also forms a basis for understanding\nsome of the things the person has done in the past and will do in the future. A rational framework\ngives meaning to a particular thing, situation, or activity by clearly indicating its relationship to\nother things, situations, and activities. By establishing such relationships, a rational framework\nmakes possible inferences from present situations to past and future situations, and from a\nparticular case to other similar cases.\niii Consider the following:\nIf you see Tamara walk to a window, open it, and climb out onto the ledge, in order to\nknow what Tamara intends requires that you engage in inquiry. You might ask her why\nshe is climbing onto the window ledge. Your question might elicit one of the following\nresponses: (1) the dirty window panes irritate her, and she is climbing onto the ledge in\norder to clean them; (2) the building is on fire and all exits are blocked except the\nwindows; or (3) she has grown tired of the loneliness and futility of life and has decided\nto commit suicide.\nGiven the first explanation of why Tamara is climbing onto the window\nledge, others may expect her to clean the window and then climb back inside. Based on the\nsecond and third explanations, however, she would be expected to leap from the ledge, instead of\nclimbing back inside. But even though we might expect her to leap in the second and third cases,\nthe reasons why she is expected to leap are different. Though she may leap in either case, the\nmeaning of her leaping, or what she intends to accomplish by leaping, is different. In the second\ncase, by leaping she means to save her life, while in the third case, by leaping she means to end\nher life.\nAn essential part of being rational is recognizing that when we see someone do something, it is\nnot always possible to see what that person intends by what he or she is doing. One common\nsource of misunderstanding often occurs when two people assume that they understand what one\nanother means, when, in fact, they don't understand. As a result, people often argue in\ndisagreement when, in fact, they agree. In other cases, people believe they are in agreement\nwhen, in fact, they are not. By requiring that the assumptions underlying our judgments and\nactions be spelled out as clearly and precisely as possible, logic facilitates the sharing and\nexchange of different points of view. We learn to avoid assuming that we know what another\nperson means or intends without having to explain how we know. When we characterize what\nsomeone does or says, we should be prepared to explain why we believe that particular\ninterpretation is true.\niv What has been said about understanding what another person is doing applies equally to\nunderstanding our own actions. We understand our own actions to the degree that we have\narticulated to ourselves a framework that gives meaning to those actions. But even this is not\nsufficient for one who is committed to being rational. A person may believe that she understands\nwhat she is doing, but the ultimate test of this is whether she is able to communicate this\nunderstanding to others. For, if no one can understand what she means, it is not obvious that she\nis making sense at all. Clarifying our actions and thoughts to others is an essential part of\nclarifying our actions and thoughts to ourselves.\nv CHAPTER 1:\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTS\n1.A. Distinguishing Arguments from Non-arguments\nNot any collection of propositions is an explanation or argument. Consider the following\npassage:\nWilson walked down the long, dimly-lit corridor. There were doors on each side of the\nhallway, each about five feet apart. As he passed he could hear the muffled sound of\nsleeping children on the other side of the closed doors.\nThe above passage is certainly a collection of propositions, each of which may be true. But there\nis no suggestion that the truth of any one of them is meant to follow from the truth of the other\ntwo propositions. In order for a collection of propositions to be considered an explanation or\nargument, the person who asserts those propositions to be true must intend that the truth of a\nparticular one of the propositions (the conclusion) should follow from the truth of the other\npropositions (the premises).\nIn an explanation or argument, the collection of propositions is organized with the intention that\nour acceptance of certain of those propositions as true (the premises) will lead us to accept the\ntruth of another of those propositions whose truth is not otherwise established (the conclusion).\nExplanations and arguments are similar. In an explanation we attempt to show why a proposition\nthat is not expected to be true is nonetheless true. Thus, we explain why the earth goes around\nthe sun, although it seems that the sun goes around the earth. In an argument we attempt to show\nwhy a proposition that may not be considered true should nonetheless be accepted as true. An\nexplanation is often after the fact. An argument is often before the fact. However, unless the\nspeaker intends to establish the truth of some proposition (the conclusion) on the basis of our\naccepting the truth of certain other propositions (the premises), that speaker is offering neither an\nexplanation nor an argument.\n1 The standard logical form for any explanation or argument is to list the premises first and the\nconclusion last.\npremise 1\npremise 2\n.\n.\npremise n\nconclusion\nThis is written, laterally, as:\nPremise 1 / premise 2 / \u2026 / premise n // conclusion\nThe premises are supposed to be connected in a way that shows why their truth makes the\nconclusion true. Often people use words to signal whether a claim they have made is intended to\nbe a premise or a conclusion. These words are called premise-indicators and conclusion-\nindicators. A word, phrase, or symbol is a premise-indicator if what follows it is the premise of\nan explanation or argument.\nExamples of Premise-Indicators:\nSince\nLet us assume that\nWhereas\nBecause\nGiven that\n.\n.\n2 A word, phrase, or symbol is a conclusion-indicator if what follows it is the conclusion of an\nargument or explanation.\nExamples of Conclusion-Indicators\nTherefore\nIt follows that\nSo\nHence\nThus\nAccordingly\n.\n.\nTo illustrate the relationship between premises and conclusions, consider the following episode:\n1. Mrs. Jones had had it. She was sick and tired of her son\n2. Billy, who failed to pick up after himself, help around the\n3. house, or contribute toward paying the bills. She had\n4. asked him time and time again to help and he always said\n5. he would, but he never really made any attempt to do so.\n6. She made up her mind that this was not going to continue.\n7. \u201cBilly,\u201d she said, as he was about to leave the next morning.\n8. \u201cI have something to tell you. When you come back this\n9. evening, the locks are going to be changed on the doors.\n10. I am not going to let you stay here any longer.\u201d\n11. Billy was shocked. He knew he neglected his duties, but it\n12. had never occurred to him that his mother would ever say\n13. such a thing to him.\n14. \u201cWhy are you going to do that?\u201d he asked.\n15. \u201cBecause you don't help out and nobody who stays under my\n16. roof is going to be a freeloader. So, I'm going to lock\n3 17. you out.\u201d\n18. Mrs. Jones looked straight into Billy's eyes as she said\n19. this, because she wanted him to know that she meant it.\n20. Billy didn't know what to say. He couldn't believe that\n21. his mother would actually do what she was threatening.\n22. Often, he had found that the best way to deal with her\n23. when she was angry was simply to say nothing at all. So,\n24. he merely nodded, picked up his coat and walked out the\n25. door.\n26. When Billy arrived home that night he found his clothes\n27. on the sidewalk. He couldn't believe it, and rushed to\n28. confront his mother in the house. But when he tried to\n29. open the door, his key wouldn't fit the lock.\n30. \u201cMother,\u201d he cried. \u201cHow could you do this to me? I\n31. thought you loved me, but you don't care anymore about me than\n32. you would a stray cat. How could you lock me out like\n33. this? How?\u201d he screamed.\n34. Mrs. Jones knew he would appeal to her motherly feelings\n35. toward him, but she controlled her responses and answered\n36. him evenly.\n37. \u201cI love you dearly, Billy,\u201d she said, her voice slightly\n38. quivering, \u201cbut you use my love as a way of avoiding your\n39. responsibilities. It is no good for you to get in the\n40. habit of using people simply because they care about you,\n41. and that is what will happen if I let you keep using me.\n42. So, I've decided that it's in your own best interest to\n43. learn your lesson now rather than later. You will only\n44. hurt yourself by taking advantage of the people who love\n45. you. That is why I've put you out.\u201d\n46. \u201cYou don't really love me,\u201d Billy cried back. \u201cYou don't\n47. really care, because if you did, you wouldn't put me out\n4 48. with no place to go. What kind of love is that? No,\n49. you don't really care about me. You just want to have\n50. people around who do only what you say do, that's all.\u201d\nIn lines 7 through 10, Mrs. Jones announces to Billy that she does not intend to allow him to\ncontinue residing in her house. In line 14, Billy asks her to explain why she intends to put him\nout. In lines 15 through 17, Mrs. Jones explains why she intends to put her son out. Her\nexplanation has the following standard form:\nNo person that is a freeloader is a person who can reside in my house.\nYou are a freeloader.\nYou are not a person who can reside in my house.\nNo person that is a freeloader is a person who can reside in my house. / You are a\nfreeloader. // You are not a person who can reside in my house.\nThe explanation has the following logical form:\nNo A is B A = person that is a freeloader\nx is A B = person who can reside in my home\nx is not B\nNo A is B. / x is A. // x is not B.\nIn line 37, Mrs. Jones says that she loves Billy, but in line 46-49, Billy attacks that claim, and\nargues that Mrs. Jones does not really love him. Billy's argument has the following standard\nform:\nIf you are a mother that loves her child, then you will not turn\nthat child away with no place to go.\nYou have turned your child away with no place to go.\nYou are not a mother that loves her child.\n5 If you are a mother that loves her child, then you will not turn\nthat child away with no place to go. / You have turned your child away with no\nplace to go. // You are not a mother that lover her child.\nBilly's argument has the following logical form, called Modus Tollens:\nIf P then not Q\nQ\nNot P\nOr: If P then not Q. / Q. // not P\nBoth Mrs. Jones' explanation and Billy's argument are collections of statements presented with\nthe intention that one proposition, the conclusion, be accepted as true because of its relationship\nwith certain other propositions, the premises, which are assumed to be true. The truth of the\nconclusion is supposed to follow from the truth of the premises. Thus, we may assume that Mrs.\nJones had long held that no freeloader could reside in her house, but it was only when she\nrealized that her son was indeed a freeloader that she was forced to the conclusion that she had to\nput him out. In a similar fashion, if Billy believes it is true that if a mother loves her child, then\nshe will not turn him away, then his being kicked out will force him to the conclusion that his\nmother does not love him. Since both explanations and arguments are collections of statements\nwhere the truth of the premises are supposed to establish the truth (or falsity) of the conclusion,\nthey have the same basic structure and so, in the remainder of this text, explanations and\narguments will be referred to generically as \u201carguments.\u201d\n6 1.A.1.

Exercises on Distinguishing Arguments from Non-Arguments:\nFor each of the following, indicate whether it a) is an argument in the generic form by\nwriting \u201cA\u201d or b) is not an argument by writing \u201cNA\u201d on the line provided.\n1. I jog every morning because that's the only way I can avoid gaining too much weight.\n2. If you have never sampled Chinese cooking, then you cannot say that you prefer\nAmerican to Chinese cooking. Likewise, if you have never been to Athens, you cannot\nsay that you prefer Paris to Athens. In general, if a person has not sampled all the options\navailable to him, he cannot prefer that which he is familiar with over that which he has no\nknowledge of.\n3. American influence is falling in foreign affairs. Inflation is driving prices sky-high.\nPollution is poisoning us with cancer-causing agents, and, global warming is increasing.\n4. If I were rich, I'd buy you the highest mountain, but I am not rich. That is why I cannot\nbuy you the highest mountain.\n5. I don't know why I should go to college. I don't know why the sun rises every day.\n7 6. Mice are rodents. Rats are rodents. And, hamsters are rodents.\n7. The Arabs are the primary oil exporting people in the world today. Most of the\nArabian people are in a state of war with Israel. But the United States supports Israel.\n8. Since religious freedom requires that the state show no favoritism between religions, it\nappears that there can be no religious freedom in America, for the American constitution\nwas created in accordance with Christian principles and these principles are often in\nconflict with the principles of Islam, Hinduism, and many other religions.\n9. The state can order its citizens to face death on the battlefield upon a declaration of\nwar. That is why if a citizen refuses, that citizen is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n10. Capitalists are used to exploiting other people. Women are the most exploited of all\nclasses of people. Women make up the majority of churchgoers, too.\n8 1.A.3. Exercises on Distinguishing Premises from Conclusion:\nFor each of the following arguments, pick out the conclusion and write it on the line below.\n1. Since I'd marry you if I loved you, it follows that I cannot marry you, for unfortunately\nI do not really love you.\n2. Either Jones loves music or Jones is trying to trick us. Let us assume that Jones is an\nhonest man and is not trying to trick us. Then, it would appear that Jones really does love\nmusic.\n3. The coal miners voted to strike because the coal contracts did not meet their demands.\n4. Every time I read a book it gives me a headache. So, as far as I'm concerned, I can do\nwithout reading because my health is more important to me.\n5. All millionaires make interest-free loans to their friends. Accordingly, if I were a\nmillionaire, I'd make interest-free loans to my friends, too.\n6. Since this is a red wine, it cannot be a Chablis.\n7. Washington, D. C. has become more multi-racial over the last twenty years. Chicago,\nDetroit, Atlanta, and Philadelphia have too. Thus, the trend is that all large cities are\nbecoming more multi-racial.\n9 8. The Israelis believe they were invaded from Lebanon, and therefore, that they were\njustified in invading Lebanon.\n9. John studies hard and is very conscientious. Hence, John will do well in college\nbecause that is what it takes.\n10. John doesn't appear to have made it to heaven because he said that if he went to\nheaven when he died, he'd come back to tell me about it. But, he hasn't been back to say\nanything to me.\n11. Almost every time I eat spinach, I get sick. Thus, if I eat this spinach, then I'll\nprobably get sick.\n12. Since no K is R and some R is not T, it follows that some K is not T.\n13. Some S are not P because some S are M and some M are not P.\n14. Some S are not M and some M are not P. Therefore, some S are not P.\n15. Since all A are B, it seems that some A are C because some B are C .\n16. No Y is Q and all Q is J, so no Y is J.\n10 17. If I see someone being robbed I would try to help them because I would want\nsomeone to try to help me if I were being robbed.\n18. Since either you love me or you would not treat me so badly, I surmise that you don't\nlove me, for you do treat me badly.\n19. If it is raining outside then there are clouds in the sky, so there must be clouds in the\nsky because it is certainly raining outside.\n20. Some people are taller than others; some are heavier than others; some can run faster\nthan others; and some can swim better than others. Such facts show that it is useless to\ninsist that every person is equal. We are all unequal.\n21. Each person is different from each other person and each person has something to\noffer that another person does not have to offer. Thus, people are equal because people\nare different.\n22. I'm not going to college, for college simply teaches you to survive within the system\nand the system is decaying.\n23. Over the centuries human beings have developed a great deal of knowledge about\nmany different kinds of things. Most of this knowledge has been codified and is taught\nwithin our universities. That is why I am going to college.\n11 24. People lose confidence in their ability to adapt to new situations when they stop\nrunning, jumping, bending, stooping, crawling, and stretching their bodies into different\npositions. As a result, people become set in their ways.\n25. People stop stretching their bodies into different positions because they become set\nin their ways and lose confidence in their ability to adapt to new situations.\n26. \u201c . . .the intellectual skills normal people display are limited, in practice, not so much\nby innate restrictions. . .as by the amount of motivating energy they are able to bring to\nbear on the tasks in question. It is the need to think that fuels the conceptual elaboration;\nwhile conversely, the level of skill reached evidences the strength of the need that\nunderlies it. This train of thought leads us to expect that limits in channel capacity are\nrarely reached; and that many individuals' levels of accomplishment will alter\ndramatically, for better or worse, as their emotional states alter.\u201d\n27. Marx was a materialist only by expedience. His purpose was to show the limits of\ncapitalism. Since no actual socialist societies existed, he could not present an actual\nalternative to capitalism. But by assuming that material accumulation for self-interest and\nother assumptions basic to capitalism held, Marx was able to show that capitalism was\ninternally inconsistent and would necessarily destroy itself. Only by hypothetically\naccepting materialism could Marx prove the transient nature of capitalism. But none of\nthis means that Marx personally was a materialist.\n12 B. Logic in Everyday Life\nLogic makes clear the criteria we use for deciding whether a particular conclusion follows from a\ngiven set of premises. It is important to recognize that one does not take a course in logic in order\nto learn how to be logical. People are usually logical. Whether a person is educated or not is\nirrelevant. Logic is basic to how human beings communicate and interact with one another. To\nillustrate this, consider the following exchange which takes place between Ms. Flotmos and her\nthree-year-old daughter, Jamie:\n1. \u201cIf you clean up your room, then I will take you for a treat,\u201d said Ms. Flotmos to her\ndaughter, Jamie.\n2. Jamie was excited by this and hurriedly cleaned up\n3. her room. When she finished, she went to her mother and\n4. said, \u201dWell, I'm finished! Can we go for the treat now?\u201d\n5. Her mother looked at the room. \u201cYou did a wonderful\n6. job, Jamie, but why do you speak as if we ought to\n7. be going for a treat? You know I am trying hard to lose weight\u201d.\n8. Jamie was startled. \u201cBut, mother,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou\n9. said that if I cleaned up my room, then you would take me\n10. for a treat .\u201d\n11. \u201cTrue,\u201d Ms. Flotmos replied, \u201cbut what does that have\n12. to do with me going for a treat?\u201d\n13. \u201cBut mother,\u201d the little girl cried, \u201cyou said\n14. you would take me for a treat if I cleaned up my room, and\n15. I cleaned up my room, so you're supposed to take me for a treat, like you said.\u201d\n16. But, I didn't merely say that I would take you for an ice cream treat ,\n17. Jamie. I said that if you cleaned up your room, then, I\n18. would take you for an ice cream treat ,\" replied\n19. Ms. Flotmos. Ms. Flotmos was very concerned about her daughter's\n20. intellectual development and always took time to discuss\n13 21. issues with her.\n22. \u201cUnderstand carefully, now Jamie. I really didn't promise\n23. that I would take you for a treat,\u201d she said, as she kissed\n24. her daughter on the forehead.\n25. \u201cBut, you did say that if I cleaned up my room, then\n26. you would take me for a treat, and that's why I cleaned up\n27. my room so fast and so well\u2013 so you would take me for a treat. And, now you say that\nyou didn't say you would take\n28. me,\u201d Jamie screamed in disbelief at her mother. \u201cWhy did\n29. you say you would take me if I cleaned up my room and now\n30. you won't do what you promised?\u201d Jamie cried.\n31. Ms. Flotmos was a bit alarmed by Jamie's tone of voice\n32. and wanted to quickly get the situation in hand.\n33. \u201cNow , Jamie,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cI've told you before about\n34. twisting the truth. I didn't say that I would take you for a treat. What I said was \u201cIf\nyou clean your room, then I\n35. will take you for a treat .\u201d\n36. \u201cThat's right,\u201d cried Jamie. \u201cThat's what you said,\n37. and I did clean my room.\u201d\n38. \u201cWell, I'm certainly happy to see that you've cleaned\n39. your room, but I really don't like to be misquoted. I\n40. didn't just say, \u2018I will take you for a treat .\u2019 I said, \u2018If you\n41. clean your room, then I will take you for a treat .\u2019 Please try to understand: when I say\n\u201cwhen\u201d, I say something with an \u2018e\u2019 in it, but I am not saying \u2018e\u2019. However,\n42. since you seem to have your heart set on going for a treat, get\n43. your coat and let us go. I love you so that I can't stand to\n44. see you so distressed and upset.\u201d\n45. Jamie ran and got her coat and away she and her mother\n46. went for a treat.\nHer mother had said if Jamie cleaned her room, then she (Ms. Flotmos) would take Jamie for a\ntreat, and because Jamie cleaned her room, Jamie felt that her mother was supposed to take her\n14 for a treat. While acknowledging what she had said and acknowledging that Jamie had cleaned\nup her room, Ms. Flotmos nonetheless felt that she was not obligated to take Jamie for a treat.\nWe intuitively recognize that, though Jamie is only three years old, she is reasoning correctly.\nAny person who reasons as Ms. Flotmos did would be illogical or a liar or both. Technically, Ms.\nFlotmos is correct in holding that she did not unconditionally say that she would take Jamie for\nan ice cream treat . Rather, she made a conditional statement, namely, \u201cIf you clean up your\nroom then I will take you for an ice cream treat.\u201d The statement, \u201cI will take you for an ice cream\ntreat,\u201d (where \u2018I\u2019 refers to Ms. Flotmos) is a logical inference from the truth of the conditional\nstatement Ms. Flotmos made and the truth of the statement describing what Jamie did.\nThe statement \u201cI will take you for a treat\u201d is inferred by means of the following argument:\nIf you (Jamie) clean up your room, then I (Ms. Flotmos) will take\nyou for a treat.\nYou (Jamie) do clean up your room.\nI (Ms. Flotmos) will take you for a treat.\nJamie is justified in drawing the conclusion she did. If her mother spoke the truth when she said,\n\u201cIf you clean up your room then I will take you for a treat,\u201d and it is true that Jamie did clean up\nher room, then her mother is obligated to act in such a way that the conclusion that she would\ntake her daughter for a treat is made true. If she does not do that, then, either she was not telling\nthe truth when she made the conditional statement or she is illogical.\nThe conclusion that Ms. Flotmos will take Jamie for a treat follows from the truth of what Ms.\nFlotmos said and the truth of what Jamie did, just as the conclusion in the following argument\nfollows from the premises given:\nIf it is raining outside, then there are clouds in the sky.\nIt is raining outside.\nThere are clouds in the sky.\n15 Both of these arguments have the same argument form, called Modus Ponens:\nIf A then B\nA\nB\nIn the study of logic, it is important that questions of form be distinguished from questions of\ncontent. The truth or falsity of a proposition is independent of the form of that proposition. When\nMs. Flotmos said to Jamie, \u201cIf you clean up your room, then, I will take you for a treat,\u201d the\nstatement she made had the propositional form, \u201cIf A then B,\u201d where:\nA = you clean up your room\nB = I will take you for a treat.\nWhenever one is given a statement of the form \u201cIf p then q,\u201d and another statement \u201cp,\u201d and one\nassumes that both \u201cIf p then q\u201d and \u201cp\u201d are true, then one is justified in inferring the truth of the\nstatement referred to by \u201cq.\u201d Any person who does not acknowledge that the truth of \u201cq\u201d follows\nfrom the truth of \u201cIf p then q\u201d and \u201cp\u201d is illogical. Only if one of the premises is false is one\njustified in not ascribing truth to such a conclusion.\nLogic ignores content and focuses purely on questions of form. We have seen that in\nrepresenting an argument in standard form, we ignore such particular features as whether the\nconclusion occurred at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the speaker's presentation. In\nrepresenting the logical form of an argument, we ignore the subject matter of the propositions\nthat make up the argument, and focus on their propositional forms and the manner in which these\npropositional forms are combined into argument forms.\n16 C. Aristotelian Logic\nA system of logic provides us with a way of representing propositions and their combinations\ninto arguments so that it is possible to decide whether an argument so represented is acceptable\nor unacceptable. In this text, we introduce two generic systems of logic: Deductive logic and\nInductive logic. Deductive logic is the primary model of reasoning used in mathematics, science,\nand legal proceedings. It has long been considered the gold standard of reasoning, in that a\ndeductively sound argument is able to force agreement, even if the proposition agreed to is\ndistasteful. Though many might intuitively reject the claim that all women are animals, if they\naccept the premises that all women are humans and all humans are animals, they are nonetheless\nforced to acknowledge that all women are animals.\nFor good deductive arguments, if the premises are true then the conclusion must be true.\nBut with good inductive arguments, if the premises are true, the conclusion is not necessarily\ntrue, but only more probably true. The conclusion of an inductive argument is never guaranteed,\neven when all available evidence supports the conclusion. Inductive arguments are most\nprominent in probability, statistics, and the experimental sciences. We will explore the basic\nelements of inductive logic in Chapter 6. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 will explore developments in\ndeductive logic from its beginnings in Aristotle to the development of modern computers.\nThe first system of deductive logic to be introduced in this text is called categorical (or\nAristotelian) logic. It is a notation system in which propositions are represented as combinations\nof two categories of things \u2013 the subject class and the predicate class. An example would be the\n(false) proposition \u201cAll dogs are cats\u201d, where \u2018dogs\u2019 is the subject class and \u2018cats\u2019 is the\npredicate class. In terms of this system, every proposition has one of the following categorical\npropositional forms (no matter what the statement is about):\nA: All S are P\u2019s\nE: No S are P\nI: Some S are P\nO: Some S are not P\n17 Following are some propositions which have A forms:\nAll jobs are wonderful.\nAll human beings are animals.\nAll flowers are plants.\nAll businessmen are honest.\nFollowing are some propositions with E forms:\nNo freeloaders are people who will reside in my house.\nNo dogs are cats.\nNo lawyers are judges.\nNo mothers are women.\nFollowing are some propositions which have I forms:\nSome horses are big.\nSome dogs are vicious.\nSome cats are fish.\nSome quarks are charmed.\nFollowing are some propositions with O forms:\nSome engines are not efficient.\nSome dogs are not animals.\nSome advertisements are not truthful.\nSome men are not human.\n18 It is important to remember that the form that a proposition has is independent of what that\nproposition is about and, therefore, independent of whether it is true or false. Form does not\ndetermine content, and content is independent of form. Following are some valid argument forms\nexpressed in the categorical or Aristotelian system of logic:\nAll A are B\nAll B are C\nAll A are C\nAll J are K\nNo K are L.\nNo J are L\nSome S are M\nAll M are P.\nSome S are P\nAll A are B\nSome A are not C.\nSome B are not C\n19 1.C.1. Exercises on Recognizing Categorical Propositions\nFor each of the following categorical propositions, (1) indicate its truth-value by writing T if the\nproposition is true and F if the proposition is false, and (2) write out the form of the proposition.\nTruth-Value Categorical Form\n1. All dogs are animals. T All D are A\n2. No animals are insects. ____________\n3. All fish are living things ____________\n4. Some living things are fish. ____________\n5. No living things are insects. ____________\n6. Some rocks are not living. T Some R are not L\n7. Some rocks are living. ____________\n8. Some dogs are living things. ____________\n9. All living things are animals. ____________\n10. Some fish are not living. ____________\n20 1.C.2. Exercises on Constructing Categorical Propositions:\nUsing the following class concepts, construct two true and two false propositions for each of the\npropositional forms indicated.\nClass Concepts: round things, brown things, dogs, cats, lizards, canines, felines, reptiles,\nmammals, animals.\nTruth-Value Categorical Form\n(T) All S are P.\n(T) All S are P.\n(F) All S are P. All round things are brown things.\n(F) All S are P.\n(T) No S are P.\n(T) No S are P.\n(F) No S are P.\n(F) No S are P.\n(F) Some S are P.\n(F) Some S are P.\n(T) Some S are P.\n(T) Some S are P.\n(F) Some S are not P.\nF) Some S are not P. Some dogs are not canines.\n(T) Some S are not P.\n(T) Some S are not P.\n21 1.C.3. Exercises on Recognizing Argument Forms:\nFor each of the following arguments, write out its argument form.\nargument: form:\n1. All dogs are animals. All D are A\nNo animals are insects. No A are I.\nNo dogs are insects. No D are I\n2. All fish are living things.\nSome living things are eaten.\nSome fish are eaten.\n3. No rocks are living things.\nAll living things are capable of feeling.\nNo rocks are capable of feeling.\n4. Some dogs are living things.\nSome living things are cats.\nSome dogs are cats.\n5. Some fish are not living things.\nSome living things are not dogs.\nNo fish are dogs.\n6. No elephants are human beings.\nNo human beings are mice.\nNo elephants are mice.\n7. All deer are mammals.\nAll human beings are mammals.\nAll deer are human beings.\n22 D. Validity, Invalidity, and Refutations\nValid deductive arguments present premises which, if accepted, require that a certain conclusion\nalso be accepted. But though a person may intend for the truth of a certain proposition to be\nconclusively established by the truth of the premises offered, this intention is not always realized.\nConsider the following argument:\nJones must be a Nazi because all Nazis hate Jews and Jones hates Jews.\nAlthough the intention here obviously is to establish the truth of the proposition, \u201cJones is a\nNazi,\u201d the truth of that proposition does not follow from the truth of the premises given. This can\nbe more clearly seen if the argument is put in standard form:\n(a ) All Nazis are people who hate Jews.\n1\nJones is a person who hates Jews.\nJones is a Nazi.\nThe argument has the same argument form as the following argument:\n(a ) All tigers are animals that eat meat.\n2\nBarack Obama is an animal that eats meat.\nBarack Obama is a tiger.\nIn each argument, the argument form is:\n(a3) All A are B\nx is B\nx is A\nIn both cases, the premises might be true, but the conclusion does not necessarily follow. It may\nbe true that all KKK members hate African Americans and it may be true that Jones hates\n23 African Americans; however it does not necessarily follow that Jones must be a KKK member.\nLikewise, though it may be true that all tigers eat meat and it may be true that Barack Obama\neats meat, it does not necessarily follow that Barack Obama is a tiger.\nA deductive argument is one in which the maker of the argument intends for the truth of the\nconclusion to follow necessarily from the truth of the premises. Thus, if you accept the premises\nto be true, you must accept the conclusion to be true. But this intention cannot be realized if the\nmaker uses an argument form from which it is possible to construct an argument where the\npremises are true but the conclusion is false.\nDEFINITIONS\nValid Argument-- An argument is deductively valid if it has an argument form such that all\narguments with that form transfer truth from premises to conclusion.\nInvalid Argument-- An argument is deductively invalid if it has an argument form such that it\nis possible for an argument to exist with that form, yet have true premises\nand a false conclusion.\nThe development of procedures for deciding when an argument is valid or invalid is a central\nfunction of any system of deductive logic. A deductive argument is invalid when the truth of the\npremises of the argument does not establish the truth of the indicated conclusion. Unfortunately,\nwhen a conclusion is already known to be true independently of the truth of the premises offered,\nit is not always easy to see the faultiness of the argument. This is illustrated by the following\ncategorical examples:\n(c ) All dogs are canines.\n1\nSome canines are vicious.\nSome dogs are vicious.\n24 (c ) All guns are weapons,\n2\nSome weapons are used illegally.\nSome guns are used illegally.\nIn each of these arguments, both the premises and the conclusion are true. Yet, neither (c ) nor\n1\n(c ) is a valid argument because each has the following argument form, which is invalid:\n2\n(c) All A are B.\nSome B are C.\nSome A are C.\nA technique commonly used to prove that an argument is invalid is to construct a different\nargument with exactly the same form as the argument in question, but where the premises are\nalready known to be true and the conclusion is already known to be false. Such an example\ndemonstrates that, for all arguments of a similar form, the truth of the premises does not\nguarantee the truth of the conclusion. Thus, the following argument proves that the arguments\n(c ) and (c ) are invalid:\n1 2\n(c ) All dogs are animals.\n3\nSome animals are cats.\nSome dogs are cats.\nThis argument has exactly the same form as (c ) and (c ). Yet, it is obvious here that the truth of\n1 2\nthe conclusion does not follow from the truth of the premises because, though in fact the\npremises are true, in fact, the conclusion is false. Arguing that the conclusion of (c ) followed\n1\nfrom the truth of its premises would be like arguing that the truth of the conclusion of (c ) had to\n3\nfollow from the truth of the premises of (c ).\n3\n25 The technique above involves producing a refutation by analogy. Thus, given a particular\nargument:\n(e ) No Muslims are Christians.\n1\nNo Christians are Hindu.\nNo Muslims are Hindu.\nRefutation by analogy involves extracting the form of that argument:\n(e) No A are B.\nNo B are C.\nNo A are C.\nand producing another argument having exactly the same form but where the premises are\nobviously true and the conclusion obviously false:\n(e ) No babies are adults.\n2\nNo adults are children.\nNo babies are children.\nor\n( e ) No men are elephants.\n3\nNo elephants are human.\nNo men are human.\nBoth (e ) and (e ) have exactly the same form as (e ), so that if the premises of (e ) are taken as\n2 3 1 1\nestablishing the truth of its conclusion, then the premises of (e ) and (e ) should be taken as\n2 3\nestablishing the truth of their respective conclusions. But this could not be because we already\nknow that the conclusions of (e ) and (e ) are false. As we will see in chpt.4, refutations by\n2 3\nanalogy are similarly constructed in the system of truth functional logic.\n26 1.D.1. Exercises on Categorical Forms:\nFor each of the following invalid arguments, (a) specify the form of the argument and (b)\nconstruct a refutation by analogy using the following class concepts (p. 17):\nExample: No dogs are cats.\nNo cats are rats.\nNo dogs are rats.\nargument form refutation\nNo A are B. No dogs are felines. ( T )\nNo B are C. No felines are canines. ( T )\nNo A are C. No dogs are canines. ( F )\n1. Some gangsters are not educated.\nSome educated people are not honest.\nSome gangsters are not honest.\na. argument form b. refutation\n2. No horses are fish.\nAll fish are scaly.\nNo horses are scaly.\na. argument form b. refutation\n27 3. All cats are felines.\nAll cats are animals.\nAll felines are animals.\na. argument form b. refutation\n4. Some students are serious people.\nSome serious people are very nice.\nSome students are very nice.\na. argument form b. refutation\n28 E. Validity and Soundness\nWhen we accept an argument, we do so believing that the argument is sound. A sound\ndeductive argument is one where we accept its premises as true and the relationship between\nthe premises and conclusion is such that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the\nconclusion false. A primary objective of this book is to clarify how to determine when the\nrelationship between premises and conclusion is such as to imply the truth of the conclusion,\ngiven premises that are true. Thus, if we assume it true that all dogs are canines and we assume it\ntrue that all canines are mammals, then we must accept it as true that all dogs are mammals. This\nargument has the form:\n(g ) All dogs are canines.\n1\nAll canines are mammals.\nAll dogs are mammals.\nThis kind of a relationship between the premises of an argument and the conclusion of an\nargument is what is referred to when we say that an argument is valid. It means that acceptance\nof the premises requires acceptance of the conclusion. Thus, the following argument is also a\nvalid argument:\n(g ) All dogs are cats.\n2\nAll cats are rats.\nAll dogs are rats.\nArguments (g ) and (g ) have the common form (g):\n1 2\n(g) All A are B\nAll B are C.\nAll A are C\n29 Argument (g ) is a valid argument because if we accept the premises to be true, then we would\n2\nhave to accept the conclusion as being true. The difference between (g ) and (g ) is that, in\n1 2\n(g ), we do in fact accept the premises of that argument to be true, whereas with argument (g ) in\n1 2\nfact, we do not accept the premises of that argument to be true. But it is only because we do not\naccept the premises of (g ) to be true that we can avoid having to accept its conclusion as true.\n2\nWhile (g ) is a valid argument, it is not a sound argument.\n2\nDefinitions:\nA deductive argument is SOUND if:\n(1) it has a valid argument form and\n(2) all of its premises are true.\nA deductive argument is FALLACIOUS if:\n(1) it has an invalid argument form or\n(2) it has at least one false premise.\nIrrespective of what a deductive argument may be about, if it has a valid argument form and if\nthe premises are true, then it is impossible for the conclusion to be false. Thus, if it were true that\nall dogs are cats, and all cats are rats, then it would be impossible for there to be a dog which was\nnot a rat. Thus, any argument with the same form as (g) would be a valid argument.\n30 1.E.1. Exercises on Constructing Sound and Unsound Arguments\nEach of the following Argument Forms is Valid. For each, construct one sound and one unsound\nargument having the same form:\ni. Categorical Forms\n1. All X are Y Sound: Unsound:\nAll Y are Z\nAll X are Z\n2. All X are Y Sound: Unsound:\nNo Y are Z\nNo X are Z\n3. All X are Y Sound: Unsound:\nSome X are not Z\nSome Y are not Z\n4. No B are C Sound: Unsound:\nSome A are C\nSome A are not B\n5.

Truth-Functional Logic\nThe second system of deductive logic to be discussed in this text is called Truth-Functional (or\nmodern) logic. This system begins with simple propositions that do not contain other\npropositions, and represents them by alphabets such as \u201cp,\u201d \u201cq,\u201d and \u201cr.\u201d These simple\npropositions are then combined by logical connectives such as \u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d \u201cif-then,\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d\ninto compound propositions with the following kinds of propositional forms:\nconditional - if p then q\nconjunction - p and q\ndisjunction - p or q\nnegation - not-q\nFollowing are some compound propositions that have conditional forms:\nIf John goes to town, then Tom will go to town.\nIf it is raining outside, then there are clouds in the sky.\nIf the water is boiling, then the water is hot.\nIf the economy expands, then unemployment will increase.\nFollowing are some compound propositions that have conjunctive forms:\nJohn is going to town and Tom will go to town.\nIt is raining outside and there are clouds in the sky.\nThe water is boiling and the water is hot.\nThe economy will expand and unemployment will increase.\n32 Following are some propositions that have disjunctive forms:\nJohn is going to town or Tom is going to town.\nIt is raining outside or it is snowing outside.\nThe water is boiling or the water is hot.\nThe economy is expanding or unemployment will increase.\nFollowing are some propositions that have negation forms:\nIt is false that today is Saturday.\nI am not asleep.\nThe water is not hot.\nIt is not the case that unemployment will increase.\nPropositions with these kinds of forms are then used to construct all the argument forms in the\nsystem. Some basic argument forms are:\nIf p then q If it is raining outside then there are clouds in the sky.\np It is raining outside.\nq There are clouds in the sky.\nIf p then q If the water is boiling then the water is hot.\nnot q The water is not hot.\nnot p The water is not boiling.\np or q The economy is expanding or unemployment will increase.\nnot p The economy is not expanding.\nq Unemployment will increase.\n33 It is important to remember that the variables in categorical and truth-functional logic take\ndifferent kinds of values: a variable used in the system of categorical logic represents a certain\nclass of things, while a variable used in the truth functional system represents a complete\nproposition.\nF.1.

Validity, Invalidity, and Refutations\nValid deductive arguments present premises which, if accepted, require that a certain conclusion\nalso be accepted. But though a person may intend for the truth of a certain proposition to be\nconclusively established by the truth of the premises offered, this intention is not always realized.\nIn truth-functional form, we might be given the following argument:\nJones must be a Nazi because if somebody is a Nazi then they hate Jewish people and\nJones certainly hates Jewish people.\nAs before, the intention is to establish the truth of the proposition \u201cJones is a Nazi.\u201d The\nargument has the following standard form:\n(b ) If Jones is a Nazi then Jones hates Jewish people.\n1\nJones hates Jewish people.\nJones is a Nazi.\nIts argument form is:\n(b) If p then q\nq\np\nThis is also the form of the following argument:\n(b ) If Lady Gaga is a man then Lady Gaga is a human being.\n2\nLady Gaga is a human being.\nLady Gaga is a man.\n38 Argument (b ) shows that in arguments of the form given by (b), the truth of the premises is not\n2\nnecessarily transferred to the conclusion, so that the premises of an argument of form (b) may be\ntrue, but the conclusion false. This means that the form of such arguments is itself not sufficient\nto guarantee that the truths of its premises are necessarily transferred to its conclusion. The form\ndoes not guarantee that true premises lead to true conclusions.\nA deductive argument is one in which the maker of the argument intends for the truth of the\nconclusion to follow necessarily from the truth of the premises. Thus, if you accept the premises\nto be true, you must accept the conclusion to be true. But this intention cannot be realized if the\nmaker uses an argument form from which an argument can be constructed where the premises\nare true but the conclusion is false.\nDEFINITIONS\nValid Argument-- An argument is deductively valid if it has an argument form such that all\narguments with that form transfer truth from premises to conclusion.\nInvalid Argument-- An argument is deductively invalid if there is an argument with the same\nform where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.\nA deductive argument is invalid when the truth of the premises of the argument does not\nestablish the truth of the indicated conclusion. Unfortunately, when a conclusion is already\nknown to be true independently of the truth of the premises offered, it is not always easy to see\nthe faultiness of the argument. The development of procedures for deciding when an argument is\ninvalid is a central feature of both categorical and truth-functional logic. This is illustrated in the\nfollowing examples:\n(d ) If Paris, France is in the USA then Paris, France\n1\nis in North America\nParis, France is not in the USA.\nParis, France is not in North America.\n39 (d ) If Jay Z is a lion then Jay Z is a feline.\n2\nJay Z is not a lion.\nJay Z is not a feline.\nIn each of these arguments, the premises and the conclusion are true. Yet neither argument is\nvalid because they share a common argument form, which is invalid:\n(d) If p then q\nnot p\nnot q\nThe invalidity of (d) is shown by the following argument:\n(d ) If Barack Obama is a woman then Barack Obama is a human being.\n3\nBarack Obama is not a woman.\nBarack Obama is not a human being.\nIt is certainly true that if Barack Obama is a woman then Barack Obama is a human being. And\nif Barack Obama is in fact a man, then it is also true that Barack Obama is not a woman. But if in\nfact Barack Obama is a man then it is certainly false that Barack Obama is not a human being.\nThus, the premises of (d ) would be true yet its conclusion false. This proves that any argument\n3\nof form (d) fails to transfer truth from premises to conclusion. (d3) is a refutation by analogy\nof (d).\n40 Thus, given the following argument:\n( f ) If Washington, D.C. is not in Europe, then Washington, D.C. is not in France.\n1\nWashington, D.C. is not in France.\nWashington, D. C. is not in Europe.\na refutation is produced by extracting its form\n(f) If not-p then not-q\nnot-q\nnot-p\nand producing another argument with the same form but where the premises are true and the\nconclusion is false:\n(f ) If Barack Obama is not human then Barack Obama is not a mother.\n2\nBarack Obama is not a mother\nBarack Obama is not human\nAn invalid argument is one where the truth of its conclusion is not necessitated by the truth of its\npremises. The conclusion of an invalid argument may be true but it is not because the premises\nof that argument are true. When the conclusion of an invalid argument is true, its truth derives\nfrom information that is not included in the premises of that argument.\n41 1.G.1. Exercises on Truth Functional Forms:\nFor each of the following invalid arguments: (a) specify the truth-functional form of the\nargument; and (b) construct a refutation by analogy.\n1. If today is Monday then tomorrow is Tuesday.\nToday is not Monday.\nTomorrow is not Tuesday.\nform: refutation:\nIf p then q If BO is a woman then BO is a human.\nnot-p BO is not a woman\nnot-q BO is not a human\n2. If Bill has had his morning coffee then Bill is not be sleepy.\nBill is not sleepy.\nBill has had his morning coffee\nform: refutation:\n3. Either Susan is the murderer or Susan is being framed.\nSusan is not the murderer.\nSusan is not being framed.\nform: refutation:\n42 4. If Mary does not get a raise then Mary will quit her job.\nMary does get a raise.\nMary will not quit her job.\nform: refutation:\nmore exercises needed\n43 H. Sound Deductive Arguments\nWhen we accept an argument, we do so believing that the argument is sound. A sound deductive\nargument is one where we accept its premises as true and the relationship between the premises\nand conclusion is such that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. A\nprimary objective of logic is to clarify how to determine when the relationship between premises\nand conclusion is such as to imply the truth of the conclusion, given premises that are true.\nDefinitions :\nA deductive argument is SOUND if:\n(1) it has a valid argument form and\n(2) all of its premises are true.\nA deductive argument is FALLACIOUS if:\n(1) it has an invalid argument form or\n(2) it has at least one false premise.\n1.H.i Exercises on Constructing Sound and Unsound Arguments:\nEach of the following Argument Forms is valid. For each, construct one sound and one unsound\nargument having the same form:\nii. Truth Functional Forms\n1. If p then q Sound: Unsound\nnot-q\nnot-p\n44 2. If not-p then not-q Sound Unsound\nnot-p\nnot-q\n3. Either not-p or not-q Sound: Unsound\nq\nnot-p\n4. If p then not-q Sound : Unsound\nq\nnot-p\n5. If not-p then q Sound: Unsound\nnot-q\np\n1.H.1. Exercises:\nIndicate, for each of the following statements, whether it is true (T), or false (F).\n1. If an argument is valid, then the truth of the premises\nnecessarily implies the truth of the conclusion. __________\n2. An argument is invalid if any other argument of identical logical form can have true\npremises and a false conclusion. ___________\n45 3. An unsound argument must be invalid. ___________\n4. A sound argument must have true premises. ___________\n5. An unsound argument must have two false premises. ___________\n6. An unsound argument must have a false conclusion. ___________\n7. An unsound argument must have one false premise. ___________\n8. A refutation of an invalid argument must have a false premise. ___________\n9. A refutation of an invalid argument must have a false conclusion. ___________\n10. An argument is valid if the truth of the conclusion of the argument (or any argument of\nidentical logical form) is necessarily determined by the truth of the premises of the\nargument. ___________\n46 CHAPTER 2\nCATEGORICAL PROPOSITIONS\nA. The Structure of Categorical Propositions\nTo \"categorize\" a person, place, time, thing, or situation is to characterize it as a member\nof a class of similar things. One does not consider the thing in question from its purely\nindividual point of view, that is, in terms of the qualities it has without relationship to any\nother things. Upon being categorized, an individual thing is known by properties that it\nhas by virtue of its being a member of the class of things referred to by that category. All\npropositions expressed in the Aristotelian system of logic are called categorical\npropositions because they are constructed using two categories of things: the subject\ncategory (or class) and the predicate category (or class). The copula, or connector\nbetween the subject and predicate, of a categorical proposition indicates how its subject\ncategory is related to its predicate category. The copula specifies whether members of the\nsubject category are also members of the predicate category or whether members of the\nsubject category are not members of the predicate category. Illustration:\nSubject Copula Predicate Quality of Copula\n(1) Strawberries are red. Affirmative\n(2) Strawberries are not red. Negative\nHowever, this is not enough. (1) declares that members of the class of strawberries are\nalso members of the class of red things, but (1) is ambiguous because it does not specify\nthe quantity of the subject class that is included in the predicate class. Thus, Ms. A might\ntake (1) to mean \u201call strawberries are red,\u201d while Mr. B might take (1) to mean \u201csome\nstrawberries are red.\u201d Ms. A and Mr. B would then be in disagreement over the truth or\nfalsity of (1). Ms. A declares (1) false because she believes that \u201call strawberries are red\u201d\n47 is false, while Mr. B declares (1) true because he believes the statement, \u201csome\nstrawberries are red\u201d is true. Statement (2) is equally ambiguous. Ms. A might consider\n(2) true because she believes that \u201csome strawberries are not red\u201d is true, while Mr. B\nmight consider (2) to be false because he believes that \u201cno strawberries are red\u201d is false.\nMany arguments develop because two parties interpret an ambiguous statement in\ndifferent ways. Such arguments are really pseudo-disagreements, because the disputing\nparties are not taking opposite sides to the same claim. By filling in missing information\nin different ways, as in (1) and (2) above, one party may argue that the statement in\nquestion is true, while the other party argues that the statement in question is false. To\navoid such pseudo-disagreements and pseudo-agreements, any statement expressed as a\ncategorical proposition must specify the following elements in the order indicated:\nQUANTITY\u2026.SUBJECT\u2026.COPULA....PREDICATE\nThe quantity specifies how much of the subject is being included in or not included in the\npredicate class. Either all or some of the subject is included in the predicate. Thus, for (1)\nabove, the two possibilities become:\nA: All strawberries are red.\nI: Some strawberries are red.\nAnd the two possibilities for (2) above become\nE: All strawberries are not red.\nO: Some strawberries are not red.\nPresented in this way, the A, E, I, and O propositions exhibit an informative symmetry.\nThe A and E propositions say something about every strawberry in the universe, and so\nare called Universal propositions. The I and O propositions refer only to part of the entire\n48 class of strawberries, and so are called Particular propositions. The copula of the A and I\npropositions affirms the inclusion of members of the subject class in the predicate class,\nwhile the copula of the E and O propositions denies inclusion of members of the subject\nclass in the predicate class. We describe this by saying that the quality of the copula in\nthe A and I propositions is Affirmative while the quality of the copula in the E and O\npropositions is Negative. It is now possible to describe any categorical proposition in\nterms of the quantity of its subject and the quality of its copula:\nA: All S are P Universal Affirmative\nE: All S are not P Universal Negative\nI: Some S are P Particular Affirmative\nO: Some S are not P Particular Negative\nWe began by specifying the structure of propositions in terms of subject, copula, and\npredicate, and we saw that propositions expressed in this manner were ambiguous. In\norder to eliminate ambiguities that might lead to needless conflict, specification of the\nquantity is required. Nonetheless, we still have not eliminated a remaining structural\nfeature leading to ambiguity. This problem arises from the way in which the E\nproposition is expressed. To illustrate, consider the following E proposition:\n(3) All strawberries are not red.\nTwo individuals might disagree over the truth and falsity of (3) because they each take it\nto mean something different. Mr. A may take (3) to be true because he knows from\nexperience that \u201csome strawberries are not red\u201d is true. On the other hand, Mr. B may\ntake (3) to be false because he knows from experience that to say of all strawberries that\nthey are not red (i.e., that no strawberries in the universe are red) is to say something that\nis false. Thus, Mr. A could insist that \u201call strawberries are not red\u201d is true while Mr. B\ncould insist that \u201call strawberries are not red\u201d is false. Here again, we have a pseudo-\ndisagreement because (3) is ambiguous and one party takes it to mean one thing while the\nother party takes it to mean a different thing.\n49 Any statement of the form \u201cAll S are not P\u201d is ambiguous. In some context it could mean\n\u201cSome S are not P,\u201d while in other contexts it could mean that \u201cNo S are P\u201d:\nE: All S are not P\nis ambiguous between\nE: No S are P\nl\nE : Some S are not P\n2\nSince this ambiguity is possible whenever we use the form \u201cAll S are not P,\u201d that form is\nbanished. Any speaker using it must specify whether it means E or E . And, since E is\nl 2 2\nthe same as the O proposition, any speaker who intends to assert a universal negative\nproposition must use the E form. Thus, the legitimate categorical propositional forms\nl\nare:\nA: All S are P Universal Affirmative\nE: No S are P Universal Negative\nI: Some S are P Particular Affirmative\nO: Some S are not P Particular Negative\nWhile \u201cNo S are P\u201d may look as if it has an affirmative form, as the A and I propositions\ndo, this is merely an accidental similarity. Essentially, the copula of the E proposition is\nlike that of the O proposition. In linguistic terms, the E and O propositions have similar\ndeep structures because they both have negative copulas, but different surface structures.\nIn biology, this would be similar to the case of individuals who have the same genotype,\nor species, but different phenotypes, the sum total of qualities.\n50 2.A.1. Exercises on Form, Quantity, and Quality:\nGive the form (A, E, I, O), Quantity (Universal, Particular), and Quality (Affirmative,\nNegative) of the following propositions and underline the copula.\nFORM QUANTITY QUALITY\n1.

Definitions\nThe use of the system of Aristotelian logic requires that one construct phrases which\nclearly designate the class of things referred to by the subject and the class of things\nreferred to by the predicate. In order to accomplish this, the subject term and the\npredicate term must be as unambiguous and precise as possible. Some of the most\ncommon fallacies in reasoning arise from terms used in an argument which are either\nambiguous or vague. Consider, for instance, the following argument:\nAll poor students are students who will not be admitted to law school.\nSmith is a poor student.\nSmith is a student who will not be admitted to law school.\nThe conclusion that Smith is a student who will not be admitted to law school appears to\nfollow only because the term \u201cpoor student\u201d is taken to refer to the same class of students\n53 in both premises. If, however, it is used in the first premise to refer to the class of\nstudents who make less than average grades, while it is used in the second premise to\nrefer to the class of students who have inadequate financial resources, then the conclusion\nobviously does not follow.\nIn constructing and evaluating arguments, it is critical that the terms used in the\narguments be clarified so that ambiguities and vague references are eliminated.\nOtherwise, we risk misleading, and being misled by such terms to draw conclusions that\ndo not really follow. We clarify the meaning of a subject or predicate term by giving\neither its denotative meaning or its connotative meaning or both.\nThe denotative meaning of a term is given by referring directly to an actual individual in\nthe class to which the term applies. Thus, we might indicate what a dog is by pointing to\none. The complete set of all individuals to which the term applies is called the extension\nof the term. Thus, the extension of the term \"dog\" is all of the things to which the term\ncan appropriately be applied. Likewise, the extension of the term \"airport\" is all of the\nplaces to which the term can appropriately be applied, and includes Kennedy Airport in\nNew York, NY, National Airport in Washington, DC, O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago, IL, and\nCharles DeGaulle Airport in Paris, France. Likewise, the extension of the term \u201calcoholic\nbeverage\u201d is all beverages to which that term is correctly applied, and includes all\nspecific instances of beverages containing gin, beer, wine, vodka, bourbon, etc.\nThe connotative meaning of a term refers to the set of qualities, properties, or\ncharacteristics shared by all the objects to which the term correctly applies. This set of\nattributes is called the intension of the term. Thus, the connotative meaning of the term\n\u201cdog\u201d is \u201cdomesticated canine mammals and their progeny\u201d. And the connotative\nmeaning of the term \"airport\" is a \u201ctract of land or water which is maintained for the\nlanding and takeoff of airplanes and for receiving and discharging passengers and cargo,\nand usually has facilities for the shelter, supply, and repair of airplanes.\u201d Likewise, the\nconnotative meaning of \u201calcoholic beverage\u201d is \u201cany beverage containing a colorless,\nvolatile, flammable liquid with chemical composition C H OH and intoxicating\n2 5\n54 properties.\u201d The property of being suitable for the landing and takeoff of airplanes is a\nproperty shared by all airports, and is thus an essential part of the connotative meaning of\nthe term \u201cairport.\u201d The property of containing a liquid with the chemical composition\nC H OH is a property shared by all alcoholic beverages, and is, thus, an essential part of\n2 5\nthe connotative meaning of the term \u201calcoholic beverage.\u201d\nMethods of Definition\nThe term to be defined is called the definiendum and the definition offered to clarify that\nterm is called the definiens. From the two kinds of meaning introduced, denotative and\nconnotative, we derive two kinds of definition.\nI. Denotative Definition\nProducing or pointing to an actual example of a term we are using is one of the most\nelementary ways of clarifying the meaning of a term. It is the way that most of us initially\nlearn our native language. Pointing to an example of a term is called an ostensive\ndefinition of that term. However, such forms of definition are limited by considerations\nsuch as the following:\n1. In many cases it is impossible to point to each member of the extension of a term.\nYet, we are expected to apply the term to new cases where appropriate.\n2. A given thing may be an example of many different terms, and pointing or\nreferring to that example does not distinguish between the meanings of the\ndifferent terms. Thus, we may refer to Martin Luther King Jr. as an example of a\ncivil rights leader, as an example of a minister, as an example of an African-\nAmerican, and as an example of a husband. Yet, the terms \u201ccivil rights leader,\u201d\n55 \u201cminister,\u201d \u201cAfrican-American,\u201d and \u201chusband\u201d certainly do not all mean the\nsame thing.\n3. Finally, some terms do not have sensible objects as members of its extension. It is\nimpossible, for instance, to point to an actual example of heaven or zero. Yet, this\ndoes not mean that the terms \u201cheaven\u201d and \u201czero\u201d are meaningless. For the\nmeaning of a term can be given not only by denotation, but also by connotation.\nII. Connotative Definition\nThe connotative definition of a term presents the properties that identify it and distinguish\nit from other terms. The properties which define a term are classified as either part of its\ngenus or part of its difference. The genus is that characteristic or set of characteristics that\ndescribes the general class to which a term belongs. The term being defined is always a\nsubclass of the more general class given by the genus, and the property or set of\nproperties that distinguishes it from other subclasses of the same genus is called the\ndifference. The class whose membership is divided into subclasses is called the genus\nclass, and the subclasses under it are called its species.\nLet us take the examples we have used earlier to illustrate the notions of genus and\ndifference. \"Airport\" has as its genus \"a tract of water or land.\" But to say that \"airport\"\nmeans \"a tract of water or land\" is, while correct, grossly inadequate and incomplete. For\nthat property does not differentiate \u201cairport\u201d from \u201cseaport\u201d or \u201cparking lot.\u201d What\ndistinguishes an airport from a seaport or a parking lot is the property of being\nmaintained for the landing and takeoff of airplanes, the discharge of passengers and cargo\nfrom airplanes, and the supply, storage, and repair of airplanes on land. It is these latter\nproperties that establish the specific difference between \"airports\" and other terms which\nhave the same genus.\nLikewise, while it is correct to say that an alcoholic beverage is a liquid, that is again an\nincomplete explication of its meaning. The term \"alcoholic beverage\" belongs to the\n56 genus \"liquids,\" but that does not distinguish a martini from a milkshake or water or a\nmyriad of other substances, all of which fall under the genus \"liquid.\" The property that\nmarks the specific difference between alcoholic beverage and other liquids is the property\nof having an intoxicating, drinkable component with the chemical composition of\nC H OH.\n2 5\nLet us now define the term \"college freshman\" by the method of genus and difference.\nThe genus class to which the term belongs is \"undergraduate college student.\" But to say\nthat a college freshman is an undergraduate college student does not differentiate it from\na college sophomore, junior, or senior. To complete the definition we need to give the\nproperties of the species \"college freshman\" that distinguishes it from other species of\nundergraduate college student (i.e., sophomore, junior, senior). In this case, the specific\ndifference is the property of \"having less than 30 semester hours of class credits\".\nFollowing is a list of the terms we have defined:\nDefiniendum Definiens\nAirport a tract of land or water (genus) that is\nmaintained for the landing and takeoff of\nairplanes, the receiving and discharging of\npassengers and cargo from airplanes, usually\nhaving facilities for the shelter, and supply\nand repair of airplanes (difference).\nAlcoholic beverage a liquid (genus) which is drinkable and\ncontains an intoxicating component with the\nchemical composition C H OH (difference).\n2 5\nCollege freshman an undergraduate college student (genus)\nwho has less than 30 semester hours of class\ncredits (difference).\n57 As the examples given indicate, relative clauses are generally used to express the specific\ndifference. The following kinds of connotative definitions are characterized by the nature\nof their specific differences:\nFunctional definitions are definitions where the specific difference is a particular use\nor function that the genus is put to. For example, a sextant is an instrument (genus)\nused for measuring distances using angles (difference).\nOperational definitions are definitions where the specific difference is a public and\nrepeatable procedure with specific outcomes. Thus, an alkaline liquid is a liquid\n(genus)/ which is such that if a piece of litmus paper is immersed in it then the litmus\npaper will turn blue.\nStipulative definitions introduce new terms as the definiendum, and stipulate the\ngenus and difference that constitute their meaning. Thus, let \"Gbal\" be defined as a\nball (genus)/ which is green (difference).\nTheoretical definitions give the meaning of a term using the concepts peculiar to a\nparticular scientific theory. Thus, \u201ctable salt\u201d is defined as \u201csodium chloride.\u201d\nLexical definitions report the definitions given a term in standard dictionaries. For\nexample, the term \"blitzkrieg\" is defined by Webster's dictionary to mean \u201cwarfare\nwhich is sudden, swift, large scale, offensive, and intended to win a quick victory.\u201d\nSynonymous definitions give the meaning of a term by introducing another term with\nthe same meaning. Thus, \"krieg\" means \"war\" in German and \"noir\" means \"black\" in\nFrench.\n58 2.B.1. Exercise on Definitions: Give the definitions of the terms under \"Definiendum\"\n(numbered 1 through 19) by identifying under \"Definiens\" their appropriate genus\n(numbered 1 through 13) and difference (numbered 1 through 19).\nDefiniendum Definiens\nGenus Difference\n1. submarine 1. male 1. parent\n2. bison 2. inflammation 2. writing\n3. pen 3. animal 3. higher learning\n4. hepatitis 4. institution 4. large\n5. arthritis 5. man 5. heavenly bodies\n6. bachelor 6. emperor 6.

Tetanus is an infectious disease caused by the tetanus bacillus.\n62 C. Rules for Definition by Genus and Difference\nTo construct correct definitions by genus and difference or to evaluate ones that are proposed,\ncertain rules should be used as guides.\nRule 1. A definition should state the most essential properties of the term being defined.\nA good connotative definition should be based on basic identifying properties of the members of\na class being defined. If one were to define \u201cman\u201d as an animal that has been to the moon, it\nwould be a violation of the rule since having gone to the moon is not essential to knowing what it\nmeans to be a man. Socrates was a man long before man had been to the moon.\nRule 2. The definition must not be too broad or too narrow.\nAn adequate definition should include all cases covered by the definiendum and only these cases.\nA definition is too broad if it includes cases or objects to which the term does not apply, and it is\ntoo narrow if it excludes cases or objects to which the term applies. Thus, the definition of\n\"shoes\" as a \"covering for the feet\" is too broad for it would include socks which are not shoes.\nAnd the definition of a \"car\" as a \"Toyota\" would clearly be too narrow for it excludes other\nexamples of a car.\nRule 3. A definition should not be circular.\nThis rule states that a definition should not contain the term to be defined or its synonym. The\nreason is that a term that needs clarification cannot be its own means of clarification. For\nexample, to define a philosopher as a person who philosophizes is a circular definition.\n63 Rule 4. A definition should be expressed in clear and neutral language.\nThe purpose of a definition is to eliminate ambiguity and vagueness in a term. Therefore, we\nshould use words that are plainer and more familiar to the listener than the term being defined.\nWe should try to use literal language in definitions rather than figurative or metaphorical ones,\nfor the latter are susceptible to varied interpretations. An example of figurative language in a\ndefinition is the definition of bread as \"the staff of life.\" This may be good poetic language but is\nan unclear definition. Of course, the obscurity of a definition is a relative thing. It depends on the\nlevel of knowledge of the listener. For example, to define \u201choloblastic\u201d as the \u201cundergoing of\ncomplete cleavage into blastomeres\u201d may be an obscure definition to non-specialists but\nperfectly intelligible to embryologists. We must also avoid the use of language with a slant or\nbias that is sarcastic, cynical or facetious. An objective definition tries to convey information\nrather than the emotions and prejudices of the speaker. Examples of biased or slanted definitions\nare: Marriage is a state of slavery. Welfare is a racket in which freeloaders take advantage of\npublic charity.\nRule 5. A definition should, if possible, be expressed affirmatively rather than negatively.\nDefinitions are supposed to explain what a term means, not what the term does not mean. Hence,\ndefinitions must be expressed affirmatively whenever possible. Thus, to define the term\n\"plutocracy\" as a form of government that is not a democracy nor a monarchy is to fail to explain\nwhat the term means. Likewise, to define a woman as a person who is not a man tells us what a\nwoman is not, but does not tell us what a woman is. Sometimes there are terms which are\nbasically negative in meaning and, therefore, are best defined negatively. For example, a\nbachelor is an unmarried man; blindness is a state of being without sight; baldness is the state of\nnot having hair on one's head, and so on. But even in these examples, there is an affirmative\nmention of the genus, though the difference is expressed negatively.\n64 2.C.1. Exercises on Connotative Definitions:\nDetermine whether the following break any of the rules for a good connotative definition:\n1. A comet is a heavenly body.\n2.

A philanthropist is a person who practices philanthropy.\n29. Darkness is the absence of light.\n30. A jury is a group of people at a criminal trial.\n31. Premarital sex is sexual intercourse between unmarried persons.\n32. A hat is covering for the head.\n33. Faith means reason blindly accepting propositions that cannot be proved.\n34. An agnostic person is someone who is neither a theist nor an atheist.\n35. A carpenter's square is a square used by a carpenter.\n36. A violin is a stringed musical instrument played with a bow.\n37. Feminism is a movement formed by a group of militant women who hate the admirable\ncareer of motherhood and being a housewife.\n38. A chicken is a domesticated bird.\n39. War is the dehumanizing use of armed violence between nations or parties within the\nstate.\n40. Feminism is a movement founded by a group of women who believe in the principle that\nwomen should have political, economic and social rights equal to those of men.\n66 D. Translation From Ordinary Language to Categorical Form\nTranslating statements from ordinary language into categorical form is not always easy. There is\nno mechanical formula that can be applied in each case in order to make a correct translation.\nYet, having to make a translation forces us to reflect on the meaning of the statement proposed\nand to separate sentiment from fact. To illustrate, consider the following statement:\n(1) Ain't nobody going to help you in this world today.\nWhile many might agree with the sentiment expressed by this statement, few would accept as\nfact the characterization of the world that the statement makes. What that characterization is,\nhowever, is not immediately obvious since it is not immediately obvious what the subject and\nwhat the predicate classes are that are being related.\nTranslating a statement into categorical form forces us to analyze and rephrase that statement in\nterms of quantity, subject, copula, and predicate. Rephrased in accordance with those parameters,\n(1) proposes that two classes of things are related in a certain manner: the class of things which\nare people in today\u2019s world (subject), and the class of things which will help you in today\u2019s\nworld (predicate). The manner in which these classes are related is exemplified by the E form\n\u201cNo S are P.\u201d Thus, (1) translated into categorical form becomes:\n(la) No things which are people in today\u2019s world are things which will help you in\ntoday\u2019s world.\nAn alternative translation of (1) could be given by taking as its subject the class of \u201cpeople in the\nworld today\u201d and as its predicate the class of \u201cpeople that will help you\u201d; and then relating these\nclasses in accordance with the E form to express the proposition.\n(lb) No people in the world today are people that will help you.\n67 Both (la) and (lb) are acceptable translations of (1) into categorical form. Of course, neither\nsounds natural. People don't ordinarily make statements like, \u201cNo people in the world today are\npeople that will help you;\u201d even less seldom would one hear a statement like, \u201cNo things which\nare people are things which will help you in the world today.\u201d Both (la) and (lb) are propositions\nexpressed in accordance with the structure of Aristotelian logic, but Aristotelian logic is not a\nnatural language. Aristotelian logic is a formal language. And, while it does have an advantage\nover natural languages in making clear (a) what classes of things are being related by a statement\nand (b) how those classes are being related, economy of words is not one of its virtues.\nPerhaps the closest analogue in everyday life to a formal language is the language of legal\ndocuments. In such documents, the parties involved and their relationship to one another must be\nspelled out as fully and specifically as possible, and in strict accordance with the form required\nby the legal system. In this way the chance for ambiguity, vagueness, and misunderstanding is\nreduced to a minimum; and systematic relationships can be clearly exhibited. It is similar with\nany formal system, and, in particular, with the system of Aristotelian logic. The subject class, the\npredicate class, and their relationship must be spelled out fully in accordance with the form\nprescribed by the system. In general, every formal system has certain advantages and certain\ndisadvantages, depending on the context and the job to be accomplished. That is why there are\nmany formal languages: the system suitable for one job may not be suitable for another.\nTo use the system of Aristotelian logic, one must construct phrases that clearly designate the\nclass of things referred to by the subject and the class of things referred to by the predicate. As\n(la) and (lb) illustrate, there is usually more than one correct way of doing this. Only after the\nsubject and predicate have been characterized is it possible to choose the proper copula (is, is\nnot, are, are not) and proper quantifier (all, no, some). To illustrate this again, if the subject of (1)\nhad been phrased as \u201cpeople in the world today\u201d and the predicate phrased as \u201cpeople that will\nnot help you,\u201d then a correct translation of (1) would have been:\n(1c) All people in the world today are people that will not help you.\n68 The fact that (la), (lb), and (lc) are all correct translations of (1) shows how there is no one\ncorrect translation for a given statement of ordinary language. But this does not mean that, for a\ngiven statement, all attempted translations are correct. It would be incorrect, for instance, to\ntranslate (1) by:\n(1d) All people who will not help you are people in the world today.\n(Id) does not preserve the meaning given by (1c). This is best seen by contrasting the form of (lc)\nwith the form of (1d).\nForm (lc): All S are P\nForm (1d): All P are S\nOften, when the proposition of the form \"All S are P\" is true, the corresponding proposition of\nthe form \"All P are S\" is false. Thus, while \"All women are human\" is true, \"All humans are\nwomen\u201d is false.\nThe only cases in which \"All S are P\" means the same as \"All P are S\" are cases in which \u201cP\u201d\nprovides a definition of \u201cS\u201d. In such cases, the proposition \"All S are P\u201d is a tautology, a\nstatement which is true by definition. In tautologies, both the subject and the predicate refer to\nthe same class of things, as in \"All bachelors are unmarried males.\" When statements are not true\nby definition, however, a proposition of the form \"All S are P\" does not generally mean the same\nas a proposition of the form \"All P are S.\" \u201cAll mothers are female\u201d does not mean that \u201cAll\nfemales are mothers\u201d.\nIn each of the categorical propositions (A, E, I, O), the meaning of the subject term and the\nmeaning of the predicate term is best given by their genus and difference. The genus of both the\nsubject and the predicate is the same, and denotes the general class of things of which the subject\nand predicate are subclasses. The difference of the subject term is that property (or set of\nproperties) that distinguishes its extension from the extension of the predicate term.\n69 Thus, in 1c (All people in the world today are people that will not help you) the genus for both\nsubject and predicate term is \"people\"; and the property that distinguishes the predicate class is\nthe property of being such \"that will not help you.\" In 1b, (no people in the world today are\npeople that will help you), the genus is again \"people\", and the subject's difference is \"in the\nworld today\", but the predicate's difference is \"that will help you.\" Finally, for \u201cno things which\nare people are things which will help you in the world today\u201d, the genus is \"things\" and the\nspecific difference for the subject is \"which are people\" and for the predicate is \"which will help\nyou in the world today.\" This is summarized in the following chart:\nGenus subject's difference predicate's difference\n1a things which are people which will help you in the world today\n1b people in the world today that will help you\n1c people in the world today that will not help you\nIn ordinary language, the genus of the subject and predicate term is often unstated. In order to\ngive a clear and precise definition of the subject and predicate terms, however, it is important to\nrephrase them in terms of genus and difference.\nSome items that typically translate into universal propositions are:\nevery; each; whenever; none; only; proper names; direct references\nFollowing is a collection of examples of correct translation from ordinary language to universal\ncategorical form. Each statement from ordinary language is numbered, and is followed by one or\nmore correct translations.\n1. Every Sunday I go to church.\n1a. All days which are Sunday are days that I go to church.\n2. Each of my children has a pet.\n2a. All people who are my children are people who have a pet.\n70 3. I love going to the beach.\n3a. All people that are me are people that love going to the beach.\n4. Whenever I hear you coming I run and hide.\n4a. All times I hear you coming are times I run and hide.\n5. None of her friends smoke.\n5a. No friend of hers is a friend who smokes.\n5b. No person who is her friend is a person who smokes.\n6. Only lawyers become judges.\n6a. All people who become judges are people who are lawyers.\n7. Only women are mothers.\n7a. All mothers are women.\n8. Mayor Jenkins presides over the City Council.\n8a. All people that are Mayor Jenkins are people that preside over the City Council.\n9a. Mary Jane won a medal.\nAll people that are Mary Jane are people who won a medal.\n10a. That pencil on the table belongs to me.\nAll things that are \"that pencil on the table\" are things that belong to me.\nWhile we may gain in clarity when the quantity of a statement is universal, we typically lose\ninformation when statements translate into particular propositions. A particular proposition is\ntrue if there is at least one individual in the subject class that is related to the predicate class in\nthe manner indicated by the quality of the copula. If there is at least one such individual, then it\nis irrelevant whether there are many more or few more such individuals. This is illustrated by the\nfollowing two statements:\n71 (la) Most children don't like spinach.\n(1b) A few children don't like spinach.\nEach of these statements could be translated into the categorical proposition:\n(1) Some people who are children are not people who like spinach.\nWhile (1) makes clear that part of the class of children are not members of the class of people\nwho like spinach, it fails to indicate how big a part. In ordinary language there are many ways of\nindicating how much of the subject class is being included in or excluded from the predicate\nclass. Such information is lost when we translate into categorical form. Some words that\ntypically translate into particular propositions are:\nmost; a few; few; a part of; a majority of; a minority of; a speck of; a heap of; most of; a\nlittle bit of; a portion of; x% of; many of.\nThe following is a collection of examples of translation from ordinary language to particular\ncategorical form. Each statement from ordinary language is numbered and followed by one or\nmore correct translations:\n1. Most football fans drink beer.\nla. Some people who are football fans are people who drink beer.\n2. A majority of the American people voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 elections.\n2a. Some people who are American are people that voted for Barack Obama in the 2008\nelections.\n3. A minority of the world population consumes 60% of the world's resources.\n3a.

When a conclusion is drawn from only one premise, the inference is said to be\nimmediate. Where there is more than one premise involved, the inference is said to be\nmediate. This chapter will study these two forms of argument in categorical logic.\nA. Arguments Expressing Immediate Inference\nWe will consider three kinds of immediate inferences:\n1. Immediate inferences embodied in the square of opposition\n2. Obversion\n3. Conversion\nI. Introduction to the Traditional Square of Opposition.\nIn everyday life, we come across many complex issues. People express their opinions\nabout them in statements or propositions. Let us take the issue of war, for example. Some\nare opposed to all forms of violence. And they express their position on war by defending\nthe proposition that \u201cAll wars are unjust.\u201d This is a pacifist position. On the other hand,\nothers might associate themselves more closely with Social Darwinism, believing that\nevolution is through survival of the fittest and that \u201cNo war is unjust.\u201d However, someone\nwho attempted to defend both propositions would be inconsistent: \u201cAll wars are unjust\nand \u201cno wars are unjust\u201d cannot both be true.\nNow suppose Alicia asserts that \u201cSome wars are unjust.\u201d Should we take this to imply\nthat she believes \u201cSome wars are not unjust\u201d? Does the truth of \u201cSome men are fathers\u201d\n79 imply that \u201cSome men are not fathers\u201d is also true? It is a common fallacy to assume that\nthe truth of a statement of the form \u201cSome S are P\u201d necessarily implies the truth of the\nstatement with form \u201cSome S are not P.\u201d Thus, many find it difficult to accept the truth of\n\u201cSome fathers are men\u201d because they misleadingly believe this would imply that they\naccept \u201cSome fathers are not men\u201d as true.\nDebates in morality, science, politics, and other areas underscore the importance of\nknowing what can be validly inferred from the assertion of a given proposition. Civil\ndebates are the way we exchange ideas and persuade others. They emphasize the\nimportance of knowing how to present, defend, and reject contentious claims. The\ntraditional square of opposition is an important tool in understanding the logical\nrelationships between categorical propositions with the same subject and predicate.\nII. The Four Kinds of Opposition\nThere are four kinds of categorical propositions, first introduced in Chapter Two: A, E, I,\nand O.\nA: All S are P Universal Affirmative\nE: No S are P (All S are not P) Universal Negative\nI: Some S are P Particular Affirmative\nO: Some S are not P Particular Negative\nEach of these propositions can serve as a premise for immediate inference. Thus, if an A\nproposition is used as a premise, then one can immediately infer that the corresponding O\nproposition (having the same subject and predicate terms as the A) is false. To illustrate,\nif the A proposition: \u201cAll car salesmen are liars\u201d is given as true, then the O proposition:\n\u201cSome car salesmen are not liars\u201d must be false.\nThe traditional square of opposition provides a basis for this kind of immediate inference.\nThe term \u201copposition\u201d was used by classical logicians to apply to the differences in\n80 quality (affirmative or negative) and quantity (universal or particular) between standard-\nform categorical propositions having the same subject and predicate terms.\nThere are four kinds of opposition:\n1. Contrary Opposition is opposition between two universals of different quality (A\nand E).\n2. Contradictory Opposition is that between a universal and a particular of different\nquality (A and O; E and I).\n3. Subcontrary Opposition is opposition between two particulars of different quality\n(I and O).\n4. Subaltern opposition is that between a universal and a particular of the same\nquality (A and I; E and O).\nThese various kinds of opposition can best be illustrated by a diagram called the Square\nof Opposition as shown below:\nFigure 3.1\n81 III. Rules of Opposition\nWe can derive rules of immediate inference for each of the four types of opposition\nmentioned above. These inferences will be from a premise to a conclusion. The premise\nwill be indicated by enclosing its truth-value in a small box within the square as shown:\nExample: In the diagram, the A proposition is the premise. We read it as: \u201cGiven the A\nas true, therefore, the O is. . .\u201d\nFigure 3.2\nDeriving the Rules of Inference for Contradictory Opposition\nContradictory Opposition is that between the A and the O, and the E and the I\nproposition. Let us consider the A and the O first.\nIf the statement, \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d (A proposition), is true, what can\nbe inferred about the opposed statement, \"Some coins in my pocket are not quarters\" (O\nproposition)? True or False? It requires little reflection to see that if the A is true, then the\nO cannot also be true. And it is equally as easy to see that if the O is true (Some coins in\nmy pocket are not quarters), then the A must be false (All coins in my pocket are\nquarters).\n82 We can summarize our analysis in a table as follows:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven A as true, therefore O is false.\nGiven O as true, therefore A is false.\nUsing the square, we can illustrate the inference thus:\nFigure 3.3\nThe truth-value in the small box shows the truth-value of the premise, and the truth-value\noutside the box is the truth-value of the possible conclusions. The arrow shows the\ndirection of the inference.\nLet us next consider the E and I Contradictories:\nE: No coins in my pocket are quarters.\nI: Some coins in my pocket are quarters.\nAgain, it is easy to see that if the E is given as true, the I cannot also be true, and if the I\nis given as true, the E cannot also be true.\n83 Using the Square, we can illustrate this in the following manner:\nFigure 3.4\nCombining the A and O and E and I inferences into a table we have:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven A as true, therefore O is false\nGiven E as true, therefore I is false\nGiven I as true, therefore E is false\nGiven O as true, therefore A is false\nObserve from the table that the premise and the conclusion cannot both be true at the\nsame time. From this observation, we can now formulate the first rule for contradictory\nopposition as follows:\nRule 1: CONTRADICTORY PROPOSITIONS CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE.\nSo far, we have been considering the premises to be true. Suppose now that the premises\nwere given as false, then what conclusion can we infer? If A is false, what is O? If O is\nfalse, what is A? If E is false, what is I? And if I is false, what is E? Again, let us consider\nour example above to see what inference we can make.\n84 If the A proposition \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d is false, then, what can we\ninfer about the corresponding O proposition \u201cSome coins in my pocket are not quarters\u201d?\nClearly, we can infer that the O must be true. And if the O is given as false, it is easy to\nsee that the A must necessarily be true.\nLet us next consider the E Proposition \u201cNo coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d to be false.\nThen, what can we infer about the I Proposition \u201cSome coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d?\nClearly, if the E is false, then the I must be true.\nWe can sum up the result of the above analysis in the following table:\nPremises Conclusion\nGiven A as false, therefore O is true.\nGiven E as false, therefore I is true.\nGiven I as false, therefore E is true.\nGiven O as false, therefore A is true.\nObserve from the table that the premise and the conclusion cannot both be false at the\nsame time. From this we can now formulate the second rule for contradictory opposition\nas follows.\nRule 2: CONTRADICTORY PROPOSITIONS CANNOT BOTH BE FALSE.\nThe rule can be summarized in terms of the Square as follows:\nA E A E A E A E\nF T F T\nT F T F\nI 0 I 0 I 0 I 0\nFigure 3.5\n85 Deriving the Rules of Inference for Contrary Opposition\nContrary Opposition is the opposition between the A and the E. Now, if A is given as\ntrue, what is E? And if the E is given as true, what is A?\nAgain, let us use the concrete example given above. Thus, if the A (All coins in my\npocket are quarters) is true, then what can be inferred about E (No coins in my pocket are\nquarters)? Well, if it is true that \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters,\u201d then it is\nnecessarily false that none are quarters. Similarly, if it is true that \u201cNo coins in my pocket\nare quarters,\u201d then it is necessarily false to say that \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters.\u201d\nWe can summarize the inferences in following table:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven A as true, therefore E is false.\nGiven E as true, therefore A is false.\nObserve in the table that the premise and the conclusion cannot both be true at the same\ntime. We can thus formulate our first rule as follows:\nRule 1: CONTRARY PROPOSITIONS CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE.\nUsing the Square to illustrate the rule, we have:\nFigure 3.6\n86 Let us now consider the premises to be given as false. Thus, if A is given as false, what\ncan we infer about E? And if E is false, what can we infer about A? To help us in our\nanalysis, let us again use the example above.\nConsider the A statement \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d to be false.\nDoes it follow that none of the coins in my pocket are quarters (E)? No, we cannot\nnecessarily infer this to be true, because it could also be the case that only some coins are\nquarters (I) while the rest are not (O).\nThus, the statement, \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d is false if either (1) \u201cNo coins\nin my pocket are quarters\u201d (E) is true, or 2) \u201cSome coins in my pocket are not quarters\n(O) is true. If we know that an A proposition is false we can conclude that the\ncorresponding O proposition must be true. But we cannot conclude that the\ncorresponding E proposition must be true. All we can conclude is that it is possible for E\nto be true, but it is also possible for E to be false. Indeed, A and E could both be false.\nOur analysis above also holds also if E is false. We cannot use this to infer that A must be\ntrue. All we can conclude is that it is possible for A to be true, but it is also possible for it\nto be false. Thus, E and A could both be false. To see this, consider that the E statement,\n\u201cNo coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d is false if 1) All coins in my pocket are quarters is\ntrue (A), or 2) Some coins in my pocket are not quarters is true (O). Since we cannot\ndetermine by logic alone which condition is the case, the truth of A is undetermined by\nthe falsity of E.\nWe can summarize our analysis in a table as follows:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven A as false, therefore E is undetermined (could be false or true).\nGiven E as false, therefore A is undetermined (could be false or true).\n87 Rule 2: CONTRARY PROPOSITIONS CAN BOTH BE FALSE.\nUsing the Square to illustrate the rule we have:\nFigure 3.7\nDeriving the Rules of Inference for Subcontrary Opposition\nSubcontrary Opposition is opposition between the I and the O propositions. Let us see\nwhat we can infer if the premises are taken as true. Consider the following example:\nSuppose we assume that the I proposition \u201cSome planets are things that have moisture\u201d\n(I) is true. What can we infer about the truth or falsity of the O proposition \"Some planets\nare not things that have moisture\"? Can we infer the O to be true? No, because further\nexploration might prove that all planets have moisture (A). If this is the case, then the O\nproposition would not be true.\nCan we infer then that the O proposition is false? We cannot infer this either since further\nexploration might prove that, in fact, some planets are actually dry, in which case the O\nproposition would be true.\nIf the I proposition is given as true, the O proposition could be false or could be true. We\ncannot determine which is the case by logical inference alone.\n88 It is similar in cases where the O is assumed true. Thus, if the statement, \u201cSome planets\nare not dry places\u201d is true (O), we cannot infer that the statement \"Some planets are dry\nplaces\" is true (I). For future investigation, might prove that \u201cNo planets are dry places\"\n(E) is true, in which case, the I proposition would necessarily be false. Thus, if the O is\ngiven as true, the truth-value of the corresponding I proposition is undetermined. That is,\nit could be true or it could be false.\nSummarizing the result of our analysis, we have:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven I as true, therefore O is undetermined.\nGiven O as true, therefore I is undetermined.\nObserve that because the conclusion is undetermined, it is possible for both subcontraries\nto be true at the same time. Thus, given the I as true, the O can be true, and given the O as\ntrue, the I can be true. From this observation, we can formulate the first rule as follows:\nRule 3: SUBCONTRARY PROPOSITIONS CAN BOTH BE TRUE.\nThe square of opposition can be used to illustrate the rule as follows:\nFigure 3.8\n89 It might be worth repeating here that contrary to common belief, we cannot infer the truth\nof one subcontrary from another. For example, from the truth of the statement, \u201cSome\npeople are rich,\u201d we cannot infer the truth of its subcontrary, namely, \u201cSome people are\nnot rich.\" This latter statement is true, not as an inference from the truth of the\nsubcontrary I proposition but from an independent source of knowledge, namely, our\nknowledge that there are, in fact, some people who are not rich. Likewise, given the truth\nof the statement \u201cSome marbles in my pocket are red\u201d it does not necessarily follow that\n\u201cSome marbles in my pocket are not red.\u201d\nNow consider the case where the premises are assumed to be false. If the statement,\n\u201cSome coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d is false, what can we infer about the statement,\n\u201cSome coins in my pocket are not quarters\u201d? If it is false that some coins in my pocket\nare quarters, then it follows necessarily that no coins in my pocket are quarters. If it is\ntrue to say that no coins in my pocket are quarters, it is also necessarily true that some\ncoins in my pocket are not quarters. So, if I is given as false, then O is necessarily true.\nWhat if an O proposition is assumed false? For example, suppose \u201cSome coins in my\npocket are not quarters\u201d is false. Then, it follows necessarily that all the coins in my\npocket are quarters. If it is true that all of the coins in my pocket are quarters, it follows\nthat some of the coins in my pocket are quarters must be true. Thus, if O is given as false,\nthen I is necessarily true. Summarizing the inferences in a table, we have:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven I as false, therefore O is true.\nGiven O as false, therefore I is true.\nFrom this we can formulate the second rule as follows:\n90 Rule 4: SUBCONTRARY PROPOSITIONS CANNOT BOTH BE FALSE.\nFigure 3.9\nDeriving the Rules of Inference for Subaltern Opposition\nSubaltern Opposition is opposition between the A and the I and between the E and the O\npropositions. If A is given as true, what can we infer about the corresponding I\nproposition? And if E is assumed true, what can we infer about the truth of the\ncorresponding O?\nAssuming the statement \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d to be true, we can infer\nthat \u201cSome coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d must be true. Similarly, if \u201cNo coins in my\npocket are quarters\u201d is true, then it must be true that \u201cSome coins in my pocket are not\nquarters.\u201d\nNext, take the I and the O as premises. Thus, if I is assumed true, what can we infer about\nthe truth or falsity of the corresponding A proposition? And if the O is assumed true,\nwhat can we infer about the truth-value of the corresponding E proposition?\n91 We can summarize our inferences in a table as follows:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven A as true, therefore I is true.\nGiven E as true, therefore O is true.\nUsing the square to illustrate the inferences, we have:\nFigure 3.10\nAssume now that the I and the O propositions are true. If the statement, \u201cSome planets\nare things that have moisture\u201d is true, can we infer that the A statement, \u201cAll planets are\nthings that have moisture\u201d is also true? Certainly not, since it remains possible that some\nplanets do not have moisture. But can we infer that the A proposition is false? We cannot\ninfer this either since it is also possible that further investigation may, in fact, prove that\nall planets are moist places. Thus, if the I is true, then the truth-value of the A proposition\nis undetermined.\nSimilarly, from the truth of the statement, \u201cSome planets are not dry,\u201d we cannot infer\nthat \u201cNo planets are dry\u201d is true. The truth of the O proposition leaves the truth of the E\nproposition undetermined. We can summarize our analysis in the following manner:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven I as true, therefore A is undetermined.\nGiven O as true, therefore E is undetermined.\n92 Using the Square to illustrate these inferential relationships, we have:\nFigure 3.11\nRule 1 summarizes the cases in which the premises are taken as true:\nRule 1: GIVEN THE UNIVERSAL AS TRUE, ITS PARTICULAR MUST BE\nTRUE.\nGIVEN THE PARTICULAR AS TRUE, ITS UNIVERSAL IS\nUNDETERMINED.\nNote: The first part of the rule makes the existential assumption. See part B of this\nchapter where this is discussed.\nLet us now examine cases where the premises are assumed to be false. First, assume the\nA statement, \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d to be false. As we analyzed earlier\nunder contrary opposition, if the statement is false, then one of the two following\nstatements is true: 1) No coins in my pocket are quarters (E), or 2) Some coins in my\npocket are not quarters (I). Since we cannot logically infer which of the two conditions is\nthe case, all we can conclude is that if the A is false, then the truth or falsity of the E and I\nis undetermined.\n93 Our analysis also holds true if the E is given as false. Thus, if \u201cNo coins in my pocket are\nquarters\u201d is false, then, either \u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d (A) is true or \u201cSome\ncoins in my pocket are quarters\u201d (O) is true. Since we cannot infer whether the A is true\ngiven that the E is false, we cannot infer the truth-value of the O. The truth value of O is\nundetermined by the falsity of E: O could be true or O could be false.\nSummarizing our analysis in a table we have:\nPremise Conclusion\nGiven A as false, therefore I is undetermined.\nGiven E as false, therefore O is undetermined.\nUsing the Square to illustrate the inferences, we have:\nFigure 3.12\nSecondly, let us assume that the premises I and O are false. If the I statement, \u201cSome\ncoins in my pocket are quarters\u201d is false, then what is the truth-value of the A statement\n\u201cAll coins in my pocket are quarters\u201d? It must be false. I cannot hold that \u201cAll coins in\nmy pocket are quarters\u201d is true if we have assumed that \u201cSome coins in my pocket are\nquarters\u201d is false. Likewise, if the O is assumed false, the E is necessarily false.\n94 We can summarize our analysis in a table as follows:\nPremise\nConclusion\nGiven I as false, therefore A is false.\nGiven O as false, therefore E is false\nUsing the Square to illustrate the table we have:\nFigure 3.13\nWe can now formulate the second rule for subaltern opposition.\nRule 2: GIVEN THE UNIVERSAL AS FALSE, ITS PARTICULAR MUST BE\nUNDETERMINED.\nGIVEN THE PARTICULAR AS FALSE, ITS UNIVERSAL MUST BE\nFALSE.\nThere are two methods of outlining inferences from the Square of Opposition, and a\nsummary of both appear on the next page. First, there is the table, which is read across\nfrom the premise to the various conclusions that can be inferred from the one premise.\n95 The second outline is by means of squares. Observe that the arrows point to the logical\ninferences that can be made from a given premise. For example, from A as true, I can\ninfer E as false and I as true. Or, having inferred I as true, I can then use it as a premise to\ninfer E as false (rule of contradiction).\nSquare of Opposition Table\nPremise Conclusions\nA E I O\nA true, therefore True False True False\nE true, therefore False True False True\nI true, therefore Undetermined False True Undetermined\nO true, therefore False Undetermined Undetermined True\nA false, therefore False Undetermined Undetermined True\nE false, therefore Undetermined False True Undetermined\nI false, therefore False True False True\nO false, therefore True False True False\nFigure 3.14\n96 We can also summarize the rules graphically by using the square:\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\nFigure 3.15\nPractical Application of the Square of the Opposition.\nOne useful application of the table of opposition is the clear indication of how to refute a\nproposition. In debates and discussions, propositions with regard to certain issues are\noften assumed, for example, \u201cAll handguns should be banned,\u201d \u201cNo abortions should be\nfunded,\u201d \u201cAll wars are unjust,\u201d \u201cAll forms of free-enterprise benefit the poor\u201d and so on.\nThe rules of opposition show that the only propositions that cannot both be true are\ncontraries and contradictories. It follows that the only way to refute any proposition is to\nestablish the truth of either its contrary or its contradictory. Let us summarize this in the\nfollowing table:\nProposition Refuted by the Truth of Squares\nA E or O 3, 7, 6\nE A or I 1, 5, 8\nI E 3\nO A 1\n97 1. Observe that the I proposition cannot be refuted by an O or the O by the I. The\nreason is that both subcontrary propositions could be true. Thus, \u201cSome horses are\ncolts,\u201d and \u201cSome horses are not colts,\u201d are both true.\n2. Observe that though the A proposition can be refuted by the E and the E by the\nA, there is the possibility that we may be refuting one false proposition by\nanother. The reason is that both contrary propositions could be false. We cannot\ninfer that if A is false, E is necessarily true. Thus, in trying to refute an A by an E,\nwhich is certainly possible, one must be sure of all of the facts. If you decide to\nrefute the Freudian claim that \u201cAll forms of religion are infantile\u201d (A), by giving\nits contrary, \u201cNo forms of religion are infantile,\u201d you must be sure that every\ninstance of religion is not infantile\u2013 a very difficult, if not impossible claim to\nestablish. This leads us to the next observation.\n3. An easier and more practical method of disproving an A or E is to establish its\ncontradictory. All you need do here is to give one instance which would contradict\nthe A or E.\nAt this point, one might ask if we cannot equally refute an A by showing its subalternant\nI to be false. If it can be shown that I is false, it follows that the A proposition is false.\nBut this procedure is really the same as establishing the contrary to be true. In other\nwords, to prove that the I is false, you have to show that the E is true.\n4. In an argument or debate, it is wise to avoid making universal statements (A or E)\nunless you are reasonably sure of all instances. Otherwise all your opponent has to do\nto refute you is to give one contradictory instance.\n5. Hedge your statements by phrases such as, \u201cFor the most part,\u201d \u201cIn general\u2026\u201d,\nand \u201cIn most cases.. . .\u201d . The resulting statements are either I or O propositions\nand are difficult to refute because this would require proving that the A or E\nuniversal propositions must be true.\n98 3.A.1.

Set Theoretic Concepts: Complementation, Venn Diagrams, and Distribution\nIn Aristotelian logic each statement in ordinary language that is true or false is interpreted\nas representing a certain relationship between two classes of things - the class of things\nreferred to by the subject of the statement and the class of things referred to by the\npredicate of the statement. Statements are re-written into standard categorical form in\norder to make clear what the subject and predicate terms are and exactly what\nrelationship is being asserted between them. We have seen that this involves clearly\nspecifying the subject class S, the predicate class P, the quantity of the subject intended\n(universal or particular) and the copula (affirmative or negative).\nThis information can be represented using Venn diagrams. This is done by first drawing\ntwo interlocking circles, the first circle representing the subject class (S) and the second\ncircle representing the predicate class (P):\nFigure 3.16\nThe two interlocking circles have three sections, section 1, section 2, and section 3.\nSection 1 is that part of S that does not contain any of P. Section 2 is that part of S that is\nalso a part of P. And section 3 is that part of P that does not contain any of S. The notion\nof the complement of a set is useful here: For any class, K, there is another class called\nthe complement of K (symbolized as non-K or K*), which consists of all the things in\nthe universe that are not members of K.\n106 K K*\nK*\nFigure 3.17\nThus, if D is the class of dogs then D* would refer to the class of all things which are\nnon-dogs.\nD D*\nFigure 3.18\nWe can now describe sections 1, 2, 3 as follows:\nSP* SP S*P S*P*\nFigure 3.19\n107 All S*P* is that part of the universe that contains no members of S and no members of P.\nSP* is that part of the universe that contains members of S and no members of P.\nS*P is that part of the universe that only contains members of P and no members of S.\nSP is that part of the universe whose elements are simultaneously members of S and\nmembers of P.\nUsing these conventions, we can now represent all the propositional forms of categorical\nlogic in Venn diagram form.\nAny statement of the form \"All S are P\" is asserting that, if there are any members of S,\nthey cannot be in that part of the universe designated SP*. Rather, they must be in that\npart of the universe designated by SP. We adopt the convention of shading in a portion of\nthe universe to indicate that nothing is in that portion.\nS*P*\nAll S are P.\nSP S*P\nFigure 3.20\nAny statement of the form \u201cNo S are P\u201d is asserting that there are no members of S that\nare also members of P. This means that there are no members of SP. SP is empty and we\nsymbolize this as:\nS*P*\nSP* S*P\nNo S are P.\nFigure 3.21\n108 In order to symbolize the kind of relationship that holds in particular propositions, we\nadopt a second convention, that of putting an X in that portion of the universe in which a\nproposition asserts that something exists. Thus, any statement of the form \u201cSome S are P\u201d\nis asserting that there is something that is a member both of S and of P. This is\nsymbolized as:\nS*P*\nSome S are P. X\nFigure 3.22\nFinally, any statement that has the categorical form of \u201cSome S are not P\u201d is asserting\nthat there exists something in S that is not a member of P. This is symbolized as:\nS* P*\nSome S are not P. X\nFigure 3.23\nThis information is summarized as follows:\n109 Propositional Form Venn Diagram Form\nS*P*\nA: All S are P\nS*P*\nS P\nE: No S are P\nS* P*\nI: Some S are P\nX\nS*P*\nO: Some S are not P X\nWe classify statements as having a universal or particular propositional form depending\non the quantity of the subject class intended. Thus, statements having an A or E form are\ncalled universal propositions because they relate every member of the subject class to the\npredicate class; in an A proposition, every member of the subject is included in the\npredicate class, while in an E proposition every member of the subject class is excluded\nfrom the predicate class.\n110 Likewise, statements having an I or O propositional form are called particular\npropositions because they relate only some of the members of that subject class to the\npredicate class: in an I proposition, part of S is included in part of P; while in an O\nproposition part of S is excluded from all of P.\nWhile we will continue to classify the form of a statement as universal or particular based\non the quantity of the subject class intended, we can nonetheless talk about the quantity\nof the predicate class that is being related to the subject class. Thus, in an A proposition\n(\u201cAll S are P\u201d), while we are saying something about every member of S, we are not\nsaying something about every member of P. While it is true that all dogs are animals\n(\u201cAll D are A\u201d), it is false that all animals are dogs (\u201cAll A are D\u201d), rather, only some\nanimals are dogs (\u201cSome A are D\u201d). In general, if all members of S are included in the\nclass of Ps, we can only conclude from this that some of P is S. Thus, in an A\nproposition, the quantity of the subject is universal and the quantity of the predicate is\nparticular.\nIn a statement having an E propositional form (\u201cNo S are P\u201d), we are excluding all\nmembers of S from being members of P. And we are excluding all members of P from\nbeing members of S. In this case, the subject class is universal and the predicate class is\nuniversal. Thus, if \u201cNo cats are dogs\u201d is true, then \u201cNo dogs are cats\u201d is equally true.\nIn a statement having an I propositional form (\u201cSome S are P\u201d), part of the subject class\nis included in the predicate class and part of the predicate class is included in the subject\nclass. Thus, both the subject and the predicate class are particular. Finally, in a statement\nhaving an O propositional form (\u201cSome S are not P\u201d) part of the subject class is being\nexcluded from all of the predicate class. The O proposition says something about every\nmember of the predicate class, namely that there is at least one member of the subject\nclass that is distinct from every member of the predicate class. Thus, the quantity of the\nsubject class is particular and the quantity of the predicate class is universal.\n111 The following table summarizes the quantity of the subject and predicate terms for each\nof the propositional forms of Aristotelian logic:\nA: All S (universal) are P (particular)\nE: No S (universal) are P (universal)\nI: Some S (particular) are P (particular)\nO: Some S (particular) are not P (universal)\nA term is distributed in a proposition if its quantity in that proposition is universal. A\nterm is undistributed in a proposition if its quantity in that proposition is particular. The\nfollowing table tells us, for each of the A, E, I, and O propositional whether its subject\n(S) or its predicate (P) is distributed or undistributed.\nDistributed Undistributed\nA S P\nE S, P\nI S, P\nO P S\n3.B.1. Exercises:\nGive the Venn Diagram representation of each of the following propositions and indicate\nwhether the subject and predicate are distributed (D) or undistributed (Und.).\n1. No elephant is beautiful.\n2. Some candies are fattening.\n112 3. All candies are fattening.\n4. Some books are not enlightening.\n5. No incubators are cold.\n6. Some important news is depressing.\n7. All elevators are round.\n8. Some independent farmers are not bankrupt.\n9. All rugs are hand-woven.\n10. Some dogs are animals that are not large.\n113 Obversion and Conversion\nTwo kinds of immediate inferences often occur in everyday life. They are formally\ncalled obversion and conversion.\nTo illustrate, take the following situation: A, B and C are discussing the economic\nsituation. A complains to B: \u201cMany poor people are unemployed.\u201d C, who is hard of\nhearing, asks B to repeat what A said. So, B tells C that A said \u201cMany poor people are\nnot employed.\u201d But A immediately objects and tells B that that is not what A had said. A\nthen repeats the original statement \u201cMany poor people are unemployed.\u201d B insists that\nthis says the same thing. Who is right, A or B?\nTake another example where A is arguing with B.\nA: \u201cI maintain that all communists are radicals.\u201d\nB: \u201cI don't agree. I don't believe that all radicals are communists.\u201d\nA: \u201cBut I didn't say that.\u201d\nB: \u201cWell, it's the same thing.\u201d\nIs B correct in her contention that \u201cAll communists are radicals\u201d means the same thing as\n\u201cAll radicals are communists\u201d?\nThe first example illustrates the immediate inference called obversion. The second\nillustrates the immediate inference called conversion.\nC. OBVERSION\nObversion is the process of constructing an equivalent statement from a premise in such a\nway that the quantity and subject of the premise remains the same while the quality and\nthe predicate are changed to their opposites.\n114 Premise: All voters are citizens.\nAll people who are voters are people who are citizens.\nObverse: No voters are non- citizens.\nNo people who are voters are people who are not citizens.\nIn the obverse, the quantity of the original statement remains universal and the subject is\nvoters, but the quality and predicate has changed. In the original statement, the quality of\nthe proposition was affirmative. In the obverse statement, it is negative and the predicate\nof the original statement is replaced by its complement. But the original meaning has not\nchanged.\nPremise: Some citizens are voters.\nObverse: Some citizens are not non-voters.\nSome citizens are not people who are not voters.\nObversion shows how one and the same idea can be expressed either affirmatively or\nnegatively.\n3C.1. Exercises:\nSee if you can determine whether the B statement has the same meaning as the A\nstatement in the following examples.\nA B\n1. All women are females. No women are people who are not females.\n2. No men are females. All men are people who are males.\n3. Some cities are overcrowded. Some cities are not overcrowded.\n4. Some workers are not employed. Some workers are employed.\n5. Some students are religious. Some students are not people who are not\nreligious.\n115 C.II. Terminology\nFollowing are some preliminary terms used in the obverse operation:\nObvertend - the premise of an immediate inference by obversion.\nObverse - the conclusion.\nComplement of class A - all things that are not A.\nThus, the complement of the class \u201ccitizens\u201d is the class of \u2018things that are not\ncitizens\u2019, or the class of non-citizens. The complement of the class \u201canimal\u201d is\n\u201cnon-animal\u201d and is the class of \u2018things that are not animals\u2019, such as plants and\nstones. However, the complement of the class \u201cheroes\u201d is not the class \u201ccowards\u201d\nbut the class of persons that are not heroes or \u201cnon-heroes.\u201d For persons who are\nnot heroes are not necessarily cowards. If we use the symbol S to denote the\nsubject class, then the complement of S is non-S. And the complement of non-S is\nnon-non S, or simply S. Accordingly, the complement of the class of non-voters is\nsimply the class of voters.\nUsing the terms obvertend, obverse, and complement, the rules of obversion are\nas follows.\nC.III. Rules of Obversion\nRule 1. The subject term of the obvertend and its quantity remains unchanged.\nRule 2. Change the copula quality of the obvertend.\nRule 3. Replace the predicate term of the obvertend by its complement.\nWe can illustrate the rules by the following example:\n116 Obvertend: All patriots are heroes. (A proposition)\nAll people who are patriots are people who are heroes.\nObverse: No patriots are non-heroes. (E proposition)\nNo people who are patriots are people who are not heroes.\nNotice that the subject term \u201cpatriots\u201d remains unchanged in meaning and in quantity in\nthe obverse. The quantifier \u201cNo\u201d has a double function. It keeps the original quantity of\nthe S term universal, but it also changes the quality of the original statement (the\nobvertend) from affirmative to negative. Thus, the original A proposition has become an\nE proposition. Lastly, observe that the predicate term of the obvertend has been replaced\nby its complement, non-P (non-heroes). From the original proposition, \u201cAll patriots are\nheroes,\" we have immediately inferred another proposition, \u201cNo patriots are non-heroes,\u201d\nwhich is equivalent in meaning to the first one.\nWe can also show by means of the two-circle Venn diagram that the obvertend \u201cAll S is\nP\u201d is equivalent in meaning to its obverse \u201cNo S is non-P.\u201d Thus, we have\nS*P* S*P*\nSP* SP SP* SP\nS*P S*P\n=\nAll S is P. No S is P*.\nFigure 3.24\nBecause the diagrams are identical, the meaning of the two statements is the same.\n117 C.IV.

CONVERSION\nConversion is the process of drawing an immediate inference or conclusion (called the\nconverse) from an original statement (called the convertend), by having the subject and\npredicate trade places.\nVenn Diagram Illustration of Conversion.\nE Proposition:\nS*P* S*P*\nSP* S*P\nSP* S*P\n=\nNo S is P No P is S.\nFigure 3.29\nI Proposition:\nS*P*\nSP* X S*P\nSP* X S*P =\nSome P is S\nSome S is P\nFigure 3.30\n125 For E and I propositions, the diagram for the convertend is the same as that for the\nconverse.

Kinds of Conversion\nA Proposition:\n(A) All S is P All gold is metal.\n(A) All P is S All metal is gold.\nE Proposition:\n(E) No S is P No dog is invertebrate.\n(E) No P is S No invertebrate is a dog.\nI Proposition :\n(I) Some S is P Some men are oppressors.\n(I) Some P is S Some oppressors are men.\nO proposition:\n(O) Some S is not P Some animals are not horses.\n(O) Some P is not S Some horses are not animals.\n1\nWe can, however, infer \u201cSome P are S\" from \"All S are P\u201d if we make the existential assumption that\nthere exists at least one member of the class S. The resulting converse is limited (from \u201cAll S are P\u201d to\n\"Some P are S\") . Hence, it is called a conversion by limitation or per accidens. More on this in the second\npart of the chapter.\n127 3.D.1. Exercises: Conversion\nA.

Some things made are chairs for rough treatment\nc. All things that are chairs are things not made for rough treatment.\nd. Some things made for rough treatment are chairs.\ne. None.\n131 E. Contraposition\nWe form the contrapositive of a statement by replacing its subject with the compliment of\nits predicate and replacing its predicate with the compliment of its subject. Thus we\nhave:\nOriginal Contrapositive\nAll S is P All P* is S*\nNo S is P No P* is S*\nSome S is P Some P* is S*\nSome S is not P Some P* is not S*\nIn each of these cases, the contrapositive is derived from the original statement by a\nseries of immediate inferences:\nStatement 1: the original statement\nStatement 2: obverse of statement 1\nStatement 3: converse of statement 2\nStatement 4: obverse of statement 3 = the contrapositive of the original\nOriginal obverse converse obverse\nAll A are B No A are B* No B* are A All B* are A*\nNo A are B All A are B* All B* are A No B* are A*\nSome Aare B Some A are not B* Some B* are not A Some B* are A*\nSome A are not B Some A are B* Some B* are A Some B* are not A*\n132 While the obverse operation always gives a statement of equivalent truth value, the\nconverse operation does not. In deriving the contrapositive of both the E and I\npropositional forms, the conversion operation is not a valid inference and does not\nnecessarily produce an equivalent propositional form. But for the A and O forms, if \u2018All\nA are B\u2019 is true, then \u2018All B* are A*\u2019 is true; and if \u2018Some A are not B\u2019 is true, then\n\u2018Some B* are not A*\u2019 is true.\nThe operations of obversion, conversion, and contraposition allow us to say simple things\nin complex ways. It also helps us to decipher complex language and reveal hidden\nmeaning.\n3.E.1. Exercises: Write out the contrapositive of each of the following statements:\n1) All mammals are animals.\n2) Some animals are not mammals.\n3) Some mammals are not animals.\n4) Some mammals are things that are not animals.\n5) No things that are not mammals are animals.\n6) All things that are not mammals are things that are not animals.\n7) All things that are not animals are things that are not mammals.\n8) No mammals are thing that are not animals.\n9) Some animals are things that are not mammals.\n133 10) Some things that are not mammals are not things that are not animals.\n3.E.2. Exercises: Determine which of the following are valid arguments:\n1) All dogs are things that are not cats. Therefore, all cats are things that are not\ndogs.\n2) No dogs are things that are not cats. Therefore, no cats are things that are not\ndogs.\n3) Some things that are dogs are cats. Therefore, some things that are cats are dogs.\n4) Some dogs are things that are not cats. Therefore, some cats are things that are not\ndogs.\n5) Some things that are not cats are things that are not dogs. Therefore, some dogs\nare cats.\n134 F. CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISMS\nIn this part of the chapter, we will consider arguments involving mediate inference,\nwhere there is more than one premise. The classic example of mediate inference is the\ncategorical syllogism. A syllogism is a deductive argument in which a conclusion is\ninferred from two premises. A categorical syllogism is a deductive argument in which the\nconclusion and the two premises are all categorical propositions.\nIntroduction\nIn everyday life, constant use is made of the categorical syllogism. We can illustrate its\nuse in the current discussion on the justification of preferential treatment for women and\nother groups that have been historically denied opportunities.\nA: I say that women deserve preferential treatment\nbecause they have been exploited and discriminated against. All\nexploited people have a right to compensation, and preferential\ntreatment is a form of compensation for historical and current injustice.\nB: I disagree with your position. I maintain that preferential\ntreatment is unfair. All awarding of jobs and educational\nopportunities should be based on merit alone.\nA: How can you talk of fair competition for jobs and education based\non merit when women have been and continue to be denied opportunities\navailable to men? There is no fairness in merit alone when women\nhave been systematically disadvantaged relative to men.\n135 B: But if you give preference to those who are incompetent, then\nthe quality of goods and services will be lowered. You don't want an\nincompetent doctor treating you, just because some bureaucrat had to fill a\nquota.\nA: I deny your premise that preferential treatment rewards incompetents.\nPreferential treatment means that among all those found competent,\nwomen should be given preference. It does not follow that the quality of\ngoods and services will be lowered.\nLet us now formalize the syllogisms contained in the foregoing discussion:\nA: All people who have been historically exploited have a right to be\ncompensated.\nAll women have been historically exploited.\nAll women have a right to compensation.\nSome forms of preferential treatment are forms of compensation.\nSome form of compensation is deserved by women.\nSome form of preferential treatment is deserved by women.\nB: All awarding of jobs and educational slots on the basis\nof merit is fair competition.\nPreferential treatment does not award jobs and educational\nslots on the basis of merit.\nPreferential treatment is not fair competition.\n136 A: Some educationally disadvantaged peoples are unable to\ncompete on the basis of merit alone.\nSome women are educationally disadvantaged\npeople.\nSome women are unable to compete on the basis\nof merit alone.\nB: All cases where employment and educational slots are awarded\nthrough preferential treatment are cases that lower the quality of\ngoods and services in the country.\nPreferential treatment awards jobs and educational slots to less competent\npeople.\nPreferential treatment lowers the quality of education and\nservices in the country.\nA: Awarding employment and educational slots to competent\nwomen over competent men does not lower the quality of education and\nservices in the country.\nPreferential treatment awards jobs and educational slots to\ncompetent women over competent men.\nPreferential treatment does not lower the quality of education\nand services in the country.\nOf course, most people do not normally argue in the formal way shown above. In\nnormal discussions, the conclusion sometimes appears first and, then, the reasons or\npremises to support the conclusion follow. This is the case in A's first argument. Again,\nin everyday arguments, sometimes not all the premises are explicitly mentioned. It is left\nto the listener to furnish the missing premise. This is the case in B's first argument.\n137 In order to analyze an argument, all the premises should be explicitly stated and the\nconclusion placed last. In this section, we will explore not only how to put syllogisms\ninto this standard form, but more importantly, how to distinguish valid from invalid\nsyllogisms.\nI. The Structure of the Categorical Syllogism\nThe standard form of a categorical syllogism has (1) three propositions, and (2) three\nterms.\nThe three propositions are:\n1. The major premise\n2. The minor premise\n3. The conclusion\nThe three terms are:\n1. The major term P\n2. The minor term S\n3. The middle term M\nConsider the following example of a categorical syllogism:\nAll animals are organisms.\nAll bears are animals.\nTherefore, all bears are organisms.\n138 II. Terms: The first step in evaluating any argument is identifying its conclusion.\nFrom our earlier study of distinguishing premises from conclusions, we know that the\nword \u201ctherefore\u201d is a conclusion indicator. Thus, the last statement in the syllogism is the\nconclusion, and the major term is the predicate term, P, of the conclusion. In the\nsyllogism given, the term \u201corganisms\u201d is the major term of the syllogism.\nThe minor term is the subject term, S, of the conclusion. In this case, it is the term\n\u201cbear.\u201d The predicate term of the conclusion is called the major term because the\npredicate of a proposition is usually wider in extension than the subject term. Thus, the\npredicate term, \u201corganisms,\u201d is wider in scope than the subject term, \u201cbear.\u201d\nThe middle term is the term, M, that appears only in the premises and connects the\nmajor and minor terms. In this case, it is the term \u201canimals.\u201d\nIII. Premises:\nThe major premise is the premise that contains the major term. In this case, the major\npremise is \u201cAll animals are organisms.\u201d\nThe minor premise is the premise that contains the minor term. In this case, the minor\npremise is \u201cAll bears are animals.\u201d\nIn a standard-form categorical syllogism, the major premise must come first, next, the\nminor premise, and lastly, the conclusion. The example above thus has the following\nstructure:\nAll animals (M) are organisms (P). (Major premise)\nAll bears (S) are animals (M). (Minor premise)\nAll bears (S) are organisms (P). (Conclusion)\nIn a lateral format, this would be written:\nAll M are P. / All S are M. // All S are P.\n139 Observe that each term appears twice in the syllogism. The major term (P) appears once\nin the conclusion and once in the major premise. The minor term (S) appears once in the\nconclusion and once in the minor premise. The middle term (M) appears once in the\nmajor premise and once in the minor premise, but it never appears in the conclusion.\nIf we eliminate the quantity and the copula and give the skeletal structure alone, then we\nhave the following figure:\nFigure 3.33\nIV. Figure and Mood of the Syllogism\nThe S, P, and M terms can vary their positions in the premises of the syllogism to\nproduce different arrangements known as figures of the syllogism.

By mood we mean the\nkind of proposition, A, E, I, or O, that appears as major premise, minor premise and\nconclusion. For example, AOI would mean that the major premise is an A proposition,\nthe minor premise is an O proposition and the conclusion is an I proposition.\nThe mood and figure of a syllogism can be presented in a box giving the figure of the\nsyllogism and specifying the form of the major premise, minor premise, and conclusion.\nThus, a syllogism with the form AAA-1 would have the following box form:\nA M P\nA S M\nA S P\n3.F.2.

No scientist is a dumb person because no dumb person is\nknowledgeable, and all scientists are knowledgeable.\n17. Every scholar is deserving of praise, since every scholar is\nhard-working and all hard-working people are deserving of\npraise.\n146 II. The Rules Method for Testing Validity.\nThe rules method is not only simple and quick, but that it also gives the specific\nfallacy involved in an invalid syllogism. One has to remember only six rules. If a\ncategorical syllogism does not violate any of these rules, then it is valid, but if even one\nrule is violated, then it is invalid. The six rules are as follows:\nRule 1: The middle term must be distributed (universal) in at least one premise.\nA violation of Rule 1 commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle\nterm.\nRule 2: No term can be distributed in the conclusion which is undistributed in the\npremise.\nA violation of Rule 2 commits either the fallacy of the illicit minor term\nor the fallacy of the illicit major term.\nRule 3: No standard form categorical syllogism is valid which\nhas two negative premises.\nA violation of Rule 3 commits the fallacy of exclusive premises.\nRule 4: A negative premise requires a negative conclusion;\na negative conclusion requires a negative premise.\nA violation of Rule 4 commits either the fallacy of drawing an\naffirmative conclusion from negative premises or the fallacy of drawing\na negative conclusion from affirmative premises.\nRule 5: From two universal premises a particular conclusion\ncannot be drawn.\nA violation of Rule 5 commits the existential fallacy of assuming a\nuniversal statement is non-empty.\n147 Rule 6: A valid syllogism must contain only three terms, each\nof which is used in the same sense throughout the argument.\nA violation of Rule 6 commits the fallacy of four terms. A specific form\nof this fallacy is called the fallacy of the ambiguous middle term.\nRule 1: The middle term must be distributed at least once.\nThe function of the middle term is to serve as a basis from which we can draw a\nconclusion about the relation between the subject and predicate terms of the syllogism. In\norder for this to be possible, it must be distributed in either the major premise or the\nminor premise. To illustrate, consider the following example:\nAll horses are animals. (major premise)\nAll men are animals. (minor premise)\nAll men are horses. (conclusion)\nRecall that a term is distributed if it refers to all members of the class designated by that\nterm. Otherwise it is undistributed. Thus, the middle term \"animal\" is undistributed in the\nmajor premise because not all, but only some animals are horses. Similarly, the term\n\"animal\" in the minor premise asserts only that some animals are men. It is invalid to\ndraw the conclusion that \"All men are horses\" because that part of the animal class which\nrefers to horses is not identical with that part of the animal class which refers to men.\nA convenient way of detecting violations of Rules 1 and 2 is by the use of the box\nmethod, which illustrates the form of the syllogism. Using the box method for the\nsyllogism above, the first column determines the mood and the next two columns\ndetermine the figure of the syllogism:\n148 Figure 3.43\nThe following table recounts the distribution of subject and predicate terms for each of\nthe categorical propositions:\nQuantity of S Quantity of P\n___________________________________________________________\nA distributed (d) undistributed (u)\nE distributed (d) distributed (d)\nI undistributed (u) undistributed (u)\nO undistributed (u) distributed (d)\nWe now determine the quantity (distributed or undistributed) for each term in the\npremises and conclusion as follows:\nA Pd Mu\nA Sd Mu\nA Sd Pu\nIf M is undistributed in both premises, then a violation of Rule 1 occurs, and we have the\nfallacy of the undistributed middle term.\nExercises for Rule 1: Determine whether the following syllogisms have a distributed\nmiddle term:\n1. Some basic rights are inalienable.\nAll persons have basic rights.\nAll persons have inalienable rights.\n149 2. All organisms are cellular.\nAll animals are cellular.\nAll animals are organisms.\n3. No cars are inexpensive.\nSome Chevrolets are cars.\nSome Chevrolets are not inexpensive.\n4. No As are Bs.\nAll Cs are As.\nNo Cs are Bs.\n5. No form of slavery is moral.\nSome marriages are forms of slavery.\nSome marriages are not moral.\n6. Some trees are deciduous.\nAll oaks are trees.\nAll oaks are deciduous.\n7. Most good singers are female.\nRoss is a good singer.\nRoss is female.\n150 8. All poisonous things are dangerous.\nAll rattlesnakes are poisonous.\nAll rattlesnakes are dangerous.\n9. Many mayors are honest people.\nSome town officials are mayors.\nSome town officials are honest people.\n10. Some gangsters are educated.\nSome educated people are not honest.\nSome honest people are not gangsters.\nRule 2: No term can be distributed in the conclusion that is not distributed in the\npremises.\nIn essence, this rule states that the conclusion of a valid argument cannot assert more than\nis asserted implicitly in the premises. An undistributed term is one that refers to only\nsome members of a class. One cannot apply to all members of that class what is true of\nonly a part of it. The following example illustrates a violation of Rule 2:\nAll cows are females.\nAll cows are mammals.\nAll mammals are females.\n151 In the minor premise, the S term \"mammal\" is undistributed, while in the conclusion the\nS term is distributed. We can clearly see a violation of the rule using the box method:\n3.44\nIn the minor premise Su translates to \"Some S\u201d (Some mammals are cows), while in the\nconclusion, Sd translates to \"All S\" (All mammals are females). To infer more in the\nconclusion than what the premise allows is to make an illicit inference; hence, the fallacy\nof overextending the S term is called the fallacy of the illicit minor.\nThe following is an example of an overextension of the major or P term in the\nconclusion:\nAll communists are radicals.\nNo communists are capitalists.\nNo capitalists are radicals.\nIf it is difficult to see the flaw in this argument, the box method will help us see it more\nclearly:\n3.45\nObserve that the major term P in the major premise is undistributed. In other words, it is\nmaking a claim about some radicals. Yet, in the conclusion, we see that the major term P\n152 is distributed. It is making a claim about all radicals. The conclusion says more than the\npremises allows. The fallacy of overextending the major term P in the conclusion is\ncalled the fallacy of the illicit major.\nii. Exercises for Rule 2.\nExamine the following syllogisms for a violation of Rule 2. Name the specific fallacy of\noverextension, where applicable.\n1. All poodles are domestic animals.\nAll poodles are dogs.\nAll dogs are domestic animals.\n2.

Exercises for Rules 1 and 2:\nDetermine whether there is a violation of rules 1 or 2 in the following syllogistic forms.\nName the fallacy involved, where applicable.\n1. All P is M 2. All M is P 3. All M is P\nAll S is M All M is S No S is M\nAll S is P All S is P No S is P\n4. All P is M 5. Some P is not M 6. All P is M\nSome M is S All S is M Some S is not M\nSome S is P Some S is not P Some S is not P\nRule 3: No standard-form categorical syllogism is valid which has two negative premises.\nThis rule follows naturally from the nature of a syllogism. A syllogism allows us to\ndetermine the relationship between S and P through their respective relationships with M.\nIf neither S nor P is related to M, we really have no mediation, and hence, no syllogism.\nTherefore, from two negative premises, no conclusion can be drawn as to the relationship\nbetween S and P.\nSome illustrations may make this clearer:\nNo gentleman is ill-mannered.\nNo lady is ill-mannered.\nNo lady is a gentleman.\nThe conclusion of this syllogism may be true, but its truth cannot depend on the truth of\nthe premises used. The subject \u201clady\u201d and the predicate \u201cgentleman\u201d are both excluded\n154 from the class of ill-mannered individuals. Therefore, there is no way to relate the class\nof gentleman to the class of ladies. All we can say is that neither a gentleman nor a lady is\nill-mannered, but this tells us nothing about the relationship between ladies and\ngentlemen.\nTo test for a violation of this rule, examine the mood of the syllogism. A violation occurs\nif any of the following combinations appear as premises: EE, EO, OE, OO.\nRule 4: A negative premise requires a negative conclusion; a negative conclusion requires\na negative premise.\nIf both S and P are excluded from M, then we have a violation of Rule 3. If one of the\nterms includes M and the other excludes M , then S and P must exclude each other.\nThus, the conclusion must be a negative statement. Consider the following premises:\nNo males are females.\nSome females are politicians.\nThe only possible valid relationship that could exist between politicians and males is\n\u201cSome politicians are not males\u201d. Whenever either premise of a syllogism is negative,\nthen the conclusion must be negative. Otherwise, we commit the fallacy of drawing an\naffirmative conclusion from a negative premise.\nRule 5: From two universal premises a particular conclusion cannot be drawn.\nIn the Venn diagrams, the particular propositions I and O were diagrammed by placing an\nx in the appropriate space. The x implies that there exists at least one member of the class\nin which it is placed. Thus, particular propositions are by definition said to have\nexistential import.\nBut universal propositions do not always have existential import. That is, they do not\nalways assert the existence of objects. For example, the statement \u201cAll students who fail\n155 the test are students who must take a make-up exam\u201d does not imply the existence of\nanyone who has or will fail the test. Many universal statements are non-committal about\nthe existence of members of the subject class S. Given this fact, we cannot claim that\nthere exists at least one member of S. A violation of Rule 5 is called the existential\nfallacy.2\niv. Exercises for Rules, 3, 4 and 5:\na. Determine whether there is a violation of Rules 3, 4 and/or 5 in the following moods.\nName the fallacy where appropriate.\n1. EEO 2. AAE 3. AEO 4. AOI\n5. OEO 6. AAI 7. OOO 8. AAA\n9. IEO 10. EAO\nb. In order to have a valid argument, determine what form, (A, E, I or O), the conclusion\nof the following premises should have, if any.\n1. AA 2. AE 3. AI 4. AO\n5. EA 6. EI 7. IA 8. OA\n9. IE 10. IO\nRule 6: A valid syllogism must contain only three terms, each of which is\nused in the same sense throughout the argument.\nThe conclusion of a categorical syllogism asserts a relationship between S and P. This\nrelationship is justified on the basis of combining premises that assert a relationship\nbetween S and M, and between P and M. If S is related to term M and P is related to\n1\nterm M , and M \u2260 M , there is no way that one can use this information to determine the\n2 1 2\nrelationship between S and P.\n2\nIn illustrating immediate inferences (square of opposition, obversion, and\nconversion), the assumption was made that S was non-empty. That is, that\nthere existed some x in S. But in illustrating syllogistic inference, it will not\nbe assumed that S is non-empty. This will give us practice in using inference\nprocedures that do and do not make the existential assumption.\n156 An example of a violation of Rule 6 is the following:\nAll men are rational animals.\nNo women are men.\nNo women are rational animals.\nIn this syllogism, the middle term \"men\" can be used with two meanings. In the major\npremise it may be used inclusively, as synonymous with all human beings and would\nrefer to both males and females. In the minor premise, \"men\" may be used in an exclusive\nsense, referring to the male of the species only. The middle term, therefore, is really two\nterms. Thus, we have four terms in the syllogism. A violation of rule 6 is called the\nfallacy of four terms. A particular instance of the fallacy of four terms is called the\nfallacy of the ambiguous middle, such as the one above. It is not the middle term alone,\nhowever, which can be ambiguous. The S and the P terms can also be ambiguous.\nAnother instance of the occurrence of four terms involves the collective and divisive use\nof a term in the same syllogism. A term is used collectively when it is the predicate of the\nsubject taken as a group. For example, in \u201cAll the angles of a triangle are 180 degrees,\u201d\nthe term, \u201c180 degrees\u201d is applied to the three angles as a group, not separately. Hence,\nthe term is used in the collective sense. A term is used divisively when it is the predicate\nof the members of the subject class taken individually. Thus, in \u201cAll the boys in our\nfamily are college-educated\u201d the predicate, \u201ccollege-educated\u201d is used divisively, and\napplied to each individual separately. The following is an example of a syllogism in\nwhich the middle term is used both collectively and divisively:\nOur team played gloriously last night.\nJill King did not play gloriously last night.\nJill King is not a member of our team.\n157 The middle term \u201cplayed gloriously last night\u201d is applied to the team taken as a group in\nthe major premise, while in the minor premise it is applied to one individual player on the\nteam. In this way, the fallacy of the ambiguous middle term is committed.\nAn essential condition for a valid syllogism is that there must be only three terms each of\nwhich is used in the same sense throughout the argument. A vague middle term prevents\nus from drawing a decisive conclusion. Terms such as \"democracy\", \"free enterprise\",\n\"law and order\", \"peace\", \"success\", and \"freedom\", when used in more than one sense in\nan argument, often result in a fallacy of four terms. In the chapter on informal fallacies,\nother fallacies resulting from the ambiguity of terms and statements will be discussed.\nv. Exercises for Rule 6:\n1.

The three-\ncircle Venn diagram offers us a technique that proves whether the conclusion necessarily\nfollows from the premises, or not. This technique involves combining the Venn diagram\nof the premises in such a manner as to implicate the Venn diagram of the conclusion. A\nsyllogism is valid if the Venn diagram of the conclusion is contained in the combined\nVenn diagrams of the premises.\nLet us proceed to explain the Venn diagram technique of determining validity. In a\nprevious chapter we introduced the two-circle Venn diagram that showed the class\ninclusion or exclusion of two terms, S and P. In a syllogism, however, we have three\nterms, S, P, and M. Consequently, we need three overlapping circles as shown below:\nS*P*M*\n1 2 3\nSP*M* SPM* S*PM*\n5\n4 SPM 6\nSP*M S*PM\n7\nS*P*M\n3.35\nS, P, M refer to the subject, predicate, and middle terms respectively.\nS*, P*, and M* refer to the compliments of S, P, and R respectively. The eight different\nclasses defined by the three-circle Venn are:\n164 1. SP*M* = those S which are neither P nor M.\n2. SPM* = those S which are P but not M.\n3. S*PM* = those P which are neither S nor M.\n4. SP*M = those M which are S but not P.\n5. SPM = those S which are both P and M.\n6. S*PM = those P which are M but not S.\n7. S*P*M = those M which are neither S nor P.\n8. S*P*M* = those that are neither S nor P nor M.\nExercise: name individuals in the above eight classes where:\nS = Americans, British, Asian, Hispanic\nP = singers athletes, scientists, politicians\nM = females, males\nLet us now practice diagramming premises into the three-circle Venn diagram. The\ndiagram for the universal premise All M is P is:\nS*P*M*\n1 2 3\nS 5 P\n4 PM 6\nP*M PM\n7\nP*M\nM\nFigure 3.36\n165 Notice that there are four sections of the circle M. Sections 5 and 6 are M which are P,\nwhile sections 4 and 7 are M which are not P. We must shade in sections 4 and 7 to show\nthat all M are P. In other words, \"M outside P is empty\", and is symbolized as MP* = \u00d8.\nLet us next diagram a particular premise: \"Some S is M.\"\nS*P*M*\n1 2 3\nS P\n4 X 5 6\n7\nM\nFigure 3.37\n166 Observe in Figure 1 that SM pertains to both sections 4 and 5. Section 4 is in SM which,\nhowever, is not a P, while section 5 is an SM which is also a P. The statement, \u201cSome S\nis M\u201d does not specify which section is meant; hence, we need to include both sections\nand we do so by putting an X on the line dividing them. Thus, \u201cSome S is M\u201d means that\nSM is not empty.\nWhen diagramming premises, remember to equate empty with shaded in areas, and not\nempty with an x. Remember, also, when you translate that \u201cAll M is P\u201d means, M outside\nP is empty; \u201cNo M is P\u201d means M inside P is empty; and \u201cSome S is not M\u201d means S\noutside M is not empty.\nWe are now ready to diagram the major and minor premises of a syllogism and then\nexamine whether their combination produces the diagram for the conclusion. Let us begin\nwith the following syllogism:\nAll S is M. / All M is P. // All S is P.\nIn standard form this would be\nAll M is P. / All S is M. // All S is P\nGiving us the mood and figure AAA \u2013 1.\n167 We begin by diagramming the premises:\nAll M is P (Major Premise) \u2013 shade 4 & 7\nAll S is M (Minor Premise) \u2013 shade 1 & 2\nS*P*M*\nS P\n1 2 3\nS 1 2 3 P\n5\n44 5 66\n7 7\nM M\nFigure 3.38\nAll S is P (Conclusion) \u2013 1 & 4 shaded\nBy combining the diagrams of the two premises, the diagram of the conclusion follows\nnecessarily. There is no member of S that is outside P, since areas 1 and 4 are shaded.\nTherefore we conclude that \"All S is P.\" follows from the premises cited.\nLet us determine whether the diagram of the conclusion is contained in the combined\ndiagrams of the premises for the following syllogism:\nNo P is M. \u2013 shade 5 & 6\nAll S is M. \u2013 shade 1 & 2\nNo S is P. \u2013 2 & 5 shaded\n168 Combining the diagrams for the premises produces the diagram of the conclusion.\n1 2 3\nS 4 5 6 P\n7\nM\nS*P*M*\nFigure 3.39\nSo far we have diagrammed universal premises. Let us now test a syllogism with one\nuniversal premise and one particular premise:\nAll M is P \u2013shade 4 & 7\nSome M is S \u2013 x in 4 or 5\nSome S is P \u2013 x in 2 or 5\nS*P*M*\n1 2 3\nS P\n5\n4 6\n7\nM\nFigure 3.40\n169 We always diagram the universal premise first . This shows us that area 4 has been\nshaded out, meaning that it is empty. The second premise, Some M is S, implies that x is\nin 4 or 5. But since 4 is empty, the x must be in 5. By combining the diagrams for the\npremises, the diagram for the conclusion is automatically produced. Therefore, the\nsyllogism is valid.\nA syllogism involving the insertion of an x is the following:\nAll P is M shade 2 and 3\nSome M is not S x between 6 and 7\nSome S is not P x in 1 or 4\nAs always, we diagram the universal premise first :\nS 1 2 3 P\n1 S 2 3 P\n5\n4 4 5 66\n7 7\nM S * P * M *M\nFigure 3.41\n170 Next we diagram the minor premise, \u201cSome M is not S.\u201d Recall that this statement\nmeans that the intersection of S*M is not empty. But S*M has two areas: 6 and 7. We\nplace an x on the line between them in order to indicate that it is in either 6 or 7. Thus, we\nhave:\n1 2 3\nS P\n4 5 6\n7\nM\nS*P*M*\nFigure 3.42\nLooking at the completed diagram, we see that the conclusion, \"Some S is not P\" is not\ncontained in the premises as diagrammed, for there is no x in area 1 or 4.\n3.G.1.

Existential Import\nIn section D of chapter 2 Venn diagrams were introduced in such a way that the Venn\ndiagram for the A and E propositions did not contain an x. This means that the truth of :\n\u201cAll S is P\u201d does not necessarily lead to the truth of \u201cSome S is P\u201d. One important reason\nfor this is the fact that there are many true propositions that do not presuppose the\nexistence of members of their subject class. An example is the following: \"All mermaids\nare half-fish\u201d. This proposition does not assert that there are mermaids which have the\nproperty of being half-fish. Rather, it asserts that if they are mermaids then they are half-\nfish. And this is diagrammed without including within it the diagram for \u201cSome\nmermaids are half-fish\". Thus, to infer the truth of \u201cSome mermaids are half-fish\u201d from\nthe truth of \u201cAll mermaids are half-fish\u201d is an invalid inference. In our discussion of the\nrules method of testing validity, this was called the existential fallacy (Rule 5): \u201cAll S are\nP\u201d can be true without assuming there are any A's; but if \"Some S are P\u201d is assumed true,\nthen we are committed to believing that there exists at least one member of S, and that it\nis also a member of P.\nThis is a very important feature of language, for it allows us to make statements such as\n\u201cAll people caught cheating on the test are people who will be expelled from the\nCollege.\u201d without assuming that some one is caught cheating on the test. On the other\nhand, many general statements are descriptive of plants, animals, people, and things that\ndo actually exist. We say that an A or E proposition has existential import if the subject\nclass of the proposition contains at least one actual individual. If this assumption is made,\nthen it is valid to infer a particular proposition from its subaltern universal, as was done\nin the traditional square of opposition. Let us call a universal propositions that do not\nassume the existence of members of their subject class a hypothetical universal; and let\nus call a universal proposition that does assume the existence of members of its subject\nclass an existential universal. The difference between them maybe shown by means of\ntheir Venn diagrams:\n172 S P\n1 2 3\nHypothetical A:\nS P\nHypothetical E:\n1 2 3\nS P\nExistential A:\n1 2 3\nS P\n1 2 3\nExistential E:\nFigure 3.47\nThese diagrams clearly show that the truth of \u201cSome S is P\u201d can be inferred from \u201cAll S\nand P\u201d and the truth of \u201cSome S are not P\u201d can be inferred from \u201cNo S are P\u201d. The\nexistential fallacy does not hold when we assume that the A and E propositions have\nexistential import.\n173 Let us now extend our use of existential A and E propositions in evaluating categorical\nsyllogisms by considering the syllogistic form AAI-3:\nAll M are P shade 4 & 7, x in 5 or 6\nAll M are S shade 6 & 7, x in 4 or 5\nSome S are P x in 2 or 5\n1 2 3\nS P\n4 5 6\nX\n7\nM S*P*M*\nFigure 3.48\nIn diagramming the premises, we must do all of the shading first before we place the x so\nthat we do not mistakenly place it in an area that is empty (shaded). Had we not done this,\nwe could have mistakenly placed the x on the line that divides areas 5 and 6. But the\ndiagram of the minor premise shows that area 6 is empty. Therefore the correct place for\nthe x is in area 5. The x here tells us that the conclusion \"Some S is P\u201d is contained in the\npremises. Hence, the argument form AAI-3 is valid.\n174 Let us next diagram the argument form EAO-3:\nNo M are P shade in 5 & 6, x in 4 or 7\nAll M are S shade in 6 & 7, x in 4 or 5\nSome S are not P x in 4\n1 2 3\nS P\n4 5 6\n7\nM S*P*M*\nFigure 3.49\nSince there is an x in area 4, the diagram for the conclusion is contained in the diagram of\nthe combined premises. Therefore the argument form EAO-3 is valid.\nFinally, let us diagram an invalid argument form: AAI-2\nAll P are M shade 2 & 3, x in 5 or 6\nAll S are M shade 1 &2\nSome S are P x in 5\n1 2 3\nS P\n4 5 6\n7\nM S*P*M*\nFigure 3.50\n175 Note that while there might be an x in area 5, this is not necessarily so. Therefore the\ndiagram of the conclusion is not necessarily contained within the diagram of the\ncombined premises. Hence, the argument form, AAI-2 is invalid.\n3.H.1 Exercises: Determine the validity of the following argument forms by means of\nVenn diagrams that incorporate the existential assumption:\n1.

No farmers are industrial workers because no farmers are factory workers and\nall factory workers are industrial workers.\nI. Enthymemes: How to Supply Unexpressed Premises and Conclusions\nNow that we have studied the science and the art of determining valid categorical\nsyllogisms, one might justly ask how practical is the knowledge we have learned. In\neveryday discourse, we do not hear people arguing by reciting syllogisms. How, then, can\nwe determine whether these arguments are valid or not? For example, someone might\nsay, \u201cOkyere can become president of the United States because she was born in\nAmerica\u201d. How can we test the validity of this type of argument?\nAn argument that is stated incompletely is called an enthymeme. The term is Greek and\nliterally taken, it means \"in the mind\". Thus, one of the premises of such an argument is\ntacit, unexpressed, yet \u201cin the mind\u201d exerting an influence on the reasoning process. To\ndetermine the validity of an enthymeme, we need to supply the unexpressed premise.\n177 First, we look for the conclusion. From it we know the subject and predicate terms which\nin turn tell us the major and minor premises. In the example above, the conclusion is\n\u201cOkyere can become president of the United States.\u201d This means that the minor premise\nis \u201cOkyere is a native-born American.\u201d The major premise is unexpressed, but we can\nsupply it. We know that it contains the predicate term, \u201ccan become president of the\nUnited States,\u201d and the middle term, \u201cnative-born American.'\u201d Thus we can form the\nmajor premise: All native-born Americans can become president of the United States.\nThe argument, completely stated, is thus:\nAll native-born Americans can become president of the United States.\nOkyere is a native-born American.\nOkyere can become president of the United States.\nWe can then restate the argument into Aristotelian propositions and proceed to test the\nsyllogism for validity.\nThe procedure for supplying the unexpressed premise is the same for enthymemes where\nthe minor premise is unexpressed: \u201cOkyere can become president because all native-born\nAmericans can become president.\u201d\nIf the conclusion is unexpressed, we must determine whether a valid conclusion can be\ndrawn from the premises given. Suppose we have the following premises:\nAll M is P.\nSome M is S.\nNow, what valid conclusion can we draw from the premises given? Is it valid to\nconclude, \u201cSome S is not P?\u201d or \u201cAll S is P?\u201d Knowledge of the rules will help us in\nidentifying a valid conclusion. We know that the conclusion always contains the terms S\nand P, but from Rule 4 we know that the conclusion cannot be \u201cSome S is not P\u201d since a\nnegative conclusion requires a negative premise. And the conclusion \u201cA1l S is P\u201d cannot\n178 be drawn either because it would violate Rule 2, which states that no term can be\ndistributed in the conclusion which is not distributed in the premise, which in this case is\nthe S term. Thus the valid conclusion would have to be \u201cSome S is P.\u201d\n3.I.1. Exercises: Enthymemes\nSupply the unexpressed premise of the following arguments:\n1. All dentists are college graduates so all members of the American Dental\nAssociation are college graduates.\n2. I am a pessimist since I believe that there is more evil than good in the world.\n3. Martin Luther King Jr. is a civil rights leader so he must be a supporter of freedom.\n4. Premarital sex is immoral because any sex outside marriage is immoral.\n5. No abortion is moral because abortion is the killing of an innocent person.\n6. Any student who graduates from Farvard University is a well-educated person\nbecause anyone who graduates from a prestigious university is a well-educated\nperson.\n7. Mary knows math very well, so Mary must be a good math teacher.\n8. All Wolves are Canines so all dogs are Canines.\n9. Nuclear war kills massively and indiscriminately; therefore it is immoral.\n10. No wealthy people are exploited; therefore no wealthy people support socialism.\n179 11. According to Orthodox Jews, the West Bank belongs to Israel because Judea and\nSamaria belong to Israel.\n12. Romney is for the rich because he favors tax cuts.\n3.I.2. Exercises: Drawing Conclusions from Premises\nDraw a valid conclusion from the following premises:\n1.

THE PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS\nConsider the following two-premise deductive arguments:\nArgument Argument Form\n(a) Today is Wednesday or today is Thursday. A or B\nToday is not Thursday not-B\nTherefore, today is Wednesday. A\n(b) If the gas tank is empty, then the car will\nnot start. If C then not-D\nThe gas tank is empty. C\nTherefore, the car will not start. not-D\nNow, these two examples embody two common argument forms. It will be the purpose of this\nchapter to develop a system of logic by means of which we can evaluate such arguments. This\nsystem of logic is called Truth-Functional or modern Logic. In truth-functional logic we begin\nwith atomic or simple propositions as our building blocks, from which we construct more\ncomplex propositions and arguments. The propositional calculus provides us with techniques\nfor calculating the truth or falsity of a complex proposition based on the truth or falsity of the\nsimple propositions from which it is constructed. These techniques also provide us with a means\nof calculating whether an argument is valid or invalid.\n185 I. Atomic (simple) Propositions\nIn the propositional calculus atomic or simple propositions are used to build compound\npropositions of increasingly high levels of complexity. The truth value of a compound can then\nbe calculated from the truth values of its simple propositions. The predicate calculus provides\nus with a way of reconstructing the categorical propositions of traditional Aristotelian logic so\nthat they can also be represented in modern truth-functional terms.\nIndividuals and Properties:\nI. Constants\nIn truth-functional logic, we specify a universe of discourse by specifying the individuals that\nexist in that universe, and the properties those individuals may have. The names of individuals in\nour universe of discourse are abbreviated using lower case alphabets a, b, c, .. .w. The names for\nthe properties possessed by these individuals are abbreviated using upper case alphabets A,B, C,\n\u2026 Z. For example, let j designate the individual John, and W designate the property of being\nwet. Then\nWx = x is wet and Wj = John is wet.\nAnd if we let d designate Debbie and A designate the property of being asleep, then\nAx = x is asleep and Ad = Debbie is asleep.\nIf the names \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cDebbie\u201d refer to actual individuals, then the propositions symbolized\nas Wj, Wd, Ad, and Aj are each actually either true or false. The individuals designated by j and\nd remain constant, no matter what property either is alleged to have. Likewise, the properties\ndesignated by W and A remain constant, no matter what individual is alleged to possess those\n186 properties. Once a name has been assigned to a particular individual or property within a given\ndiscourse, it does not change.\nII. Variables\nThe propositional form Wx attributes the property of being wet to an individual, x, where x\ncould refer to any of the individuals in our universe of discourse. x is an individual variable,\nand Wx is a propositional form that becomes an actual proposition when x is replaced by the\n(abbreviated) name of an actual individual. Individual variables are place-holders for the names\nof individuals. The lower case alphabets x, y, and z are typically used as individual variables. A\npropositional form is neither true nor false, but it becomes true or false when its individual\nvariables are replaced by individual constants.\nIn a similar fashion, every proposition that attributes a property to a particular individual, j, has\nthe propositional form \u03a6j (read \u201cphi of j\u201d or \u201cj has the property \u03a6; \u03a6 is the Greek alphabet\npronounced \u201cphi\u201d). Greek alphabets are used as place holders for properties that individuals may\nhave, and are called predicate variables. Thus, \u03a6j is a propositional form that becomes an\nactual proposition when \u03a6 is replaced by the name of an actual property (e.g. W or A), which is\nthen either truly or falsely attributed to John.\nIn the examples used so far, some individual, x, is alleged to have some property, \u03a6.\nWhen a property can be attributed to a single individual, it is called a monadic or one-place\npredicate. Thus, Wd can be true independently of whether any other individual in our universe\nof discourse is wet. The following examples of one-place predicates are designated by sub-\nscripted alphabets. In this way, an infinite number of predicates can be generated and combined\nwith the names of individuals to produce statements that are either true or false.\n187 A x = x is a Republican B x = x is a human\n1 1\nA x = x is a Democrat B x = x is a college professor\n2 2\nA x = x is an American. B x = x is a woman\n3 3\nA x = x is the USA president B x = x is a man\n4 4\nA x = x is a Christian B x = x is a musician\n5 5\nA x = x is hardworking. B x = x is a Muslim\n6 6\nA x= x is asleep B x = x is a Buddhist\n7 7\nA x = x is a Hindu B x = x is wealthy\n8 8\nA x = x is an engineer B x = x is a soccer player\n9 9\nA x = x is Jewish B x = x is a basketball player\n10 10\n4.I.1. Exercise: Using lower case letters to designate the names of actual individuals, construct\none true and one false proposition for each of the above predicates.\nIII. Relational Properties\nBut not all properties can meaningfully be attributed to just a single individual. Many\nproperties point to a relationship between two or more individuals rather than to an attribute of a\nsingle individual. For example, if M designates the property of being married, then Md (Debbie\nis married) is either true or false. But being married does not refer to the property of a single\nindividual, but designates a relationship between (at least two) individuals. Thus, construing the\nproperty of being married as if it were like the property of being wet is misleading.\n188 While Wd can be true independently of whether any other individual is wet, Md cannot\nbe true independently of whether any other individual is married. A statement of the form Mx is\nreally short for Mxy, which reads x is married to y. Thus, if Md is true, then there must be some\nother individual, e, such that Mde. Being married is not a one-place predicate, but (in a\nmonogamous universe) a two place predicate. A two place predicate designates a relationship\nbetween two individuals, rather than a property of one individual. Following are some examples\nof statement forms with two-place predicates:\nNxy = x is next to y Wxy = x weighs more than y\nTxy = x is playing tennis with y Exy = x is an employee of y\nMxy = x is the mother of y Fxy = x is the father of y\nNote that while it is true that (if Nxy then Nyx), it is false that (if Wxy then Wyx). Some two-\nplace predicates are commutative, but many are not. Following are some examples of two-place\npredicates that are often expressed as if they were one-place predicates:\nOne Place What is meant Two Place\nx is in love Lx x is in love with y. Lxy\nx is angry Ax x is angry at y Axy\nx is a parent. Px x is a parent of y. Pxy\nx is strong. Sx x is stronger than y. Sxy\nx is a veteran Vx x is a veteran of war y Vxy\nx is reading Rxy x is reading y Rxy\nx is eating Ex x is eating y Exy\nSome properties refer to relationships between three individuals. Thus, \u2018x is between y\nand z\u2019 = Bxyz. Likewise, \u2018x is a child\u2019 is shorthand for \u2018x is a child of y and z\u2019 or Cxyz.\n189 \u2018Between\u2019 and \u2018is a child\u2019 are three-place predicates. Some predicates actually refer to a\nrelationship between four individuals, yet appear to be about one individual. Thus, \u2018x is playing\ntennis doubles\u2019 (or TDx) may seem to be saying something only about x. But it is shorthand for\n\u2018x is playing tennis doubles with y, z and w\u2019 ( or TDxyzw). We symbolize 1-place, 2-place, 3-\nplace, and n-place predicates as Ax, Bxy, Cxyz, Dwxyz, \u2026 These statement forms become\nactual statements that are true or false when each variable is replaced by a constant.\n4.I.2. Exercises:\nCxyz = \u201cx is between y and z.\u201d\nLet a, b, and c be distinct points on a straight line.\nAnswer the following:\n1.) C is a ____-place predicate.\n2.) If Cabc is true, then Cbca must be ____(True/False)\n3.) If Cabc is true, then Cacb must be _____(True/False)\n4.I.3. Exercises:\nMxy = \u201cx is married to y.\u201d\nPxyz = \u201cx and y are the parents of z.\u201d\nBonnie = b, Joe = j, and Ted = t.\nAnswer the following:\n1.) M is a ___-place predicate.\n2.) P is a ____-place predicate.\nSymbolize each of the following statements:\n3.) Bonnie is married to Joe. _______\n4.) Ted and Joe are the parents of Bonnie. _______\n5.) Ted is married to Joe.\n6.) Ted is married to Bonnie. _______\n7.) Joe and Bonnie are the parents of Ted. _______\n190 II. Compound Propositions\nA compound proposition is one that contains other propositions as component parts. For\nexample, the proposition, \u201cToday is Wednesday or today is Thursday\u201d contains two component\npropositions: \u201cToday is Wednesday\u201d and \"Today is Thursday.\u201d Similarly, the proposition, \u201cIf the\ngas tank is empty, then the car will not start\u201d is a compound proposition that contains the two\ncomponent propositions: \u201cThe gas tank is empty,\u201d and \u201cThe car will not start.\u201d Propositions that\ndo not contain other propositions are called simple propositions.\nII. Truth- functional Compound Propositions\nThe kinds of compound propositions we are concerned with are called truth-functional\ncompound propositions. A truth-functional compound proposition is a proposition whose truth or\nfalsity (that is, truth-value) is a function of the truth or falsity of its component propositions.\nAppropriately, the logic that deals with truth-functional compound propositions is called truth-\nfunctional logic.\nIII. Kinds of Truth-functional Compound Propositions\nTruth-functional compound propositions are conventionally classified into five kinds:\n1. Negations: The denial of a statement in English is usually made by inserting a \u201cnot\u201d into the\noriginal statement. For example, the statement \u201cJohn F. Kennedy was killed by the Mafia\u201d is\nnegated by inserting \u201cnot\u201d to produce \u201cJohn F. Kennedy was not killed by the Mafia.\u201d One can\nalso express a negation in English by such alternative phrases as \u201cit is false that\u201d or \u201cit is not the\ncase that.\u201d\n2. Conjunctions: When two statements are joined by the word \u201cand\u201d between them, it is called a\nconjunction. The component statements are called conjuncts. Thus, the compound statement,\n191 \u201cMr. Obama is the President of the United States and Mr. Biden is his Vice-President\u201d is a\nconjunction.\nConjunctions can be expressed in alternative ways in ordinary English. To illustrate, the standard\nconjunction \u201cPeter went to school and Paul stayed home\u201d can be expressed in non-standard\nforms as:\nPeter went to school, while Paul stayed home.\nPeter went to school, but Paul stayed home.\nPeter went to school, even though Paul stayed home.\nAlthough Peter went to school, Paul stayed home.\nAlthough Paul stayed home, Peter went to school.\nPeter went to school; however, Paul stayed home.\nThere is no logical limit to the number of components in a conjunction. It could have more than\ntwo, as in \u201cMary baked a cake and Susan went shopping while Tina slept and John drove to\nwork.\u201d\n3. Disjunctions: A compound statement in which two or more components are connected by the\nword \u201cor\u201d is called a disjunction. The component statements so combined are called disjuncts (or\nalternatives). Example: \u201cWe economize on the use of energy or we will have run-away\ninflation.\u201d (We will later make a distinction between the \u2018inclusive\u2019 and \u2018exclusive\u2019 senses of the\nword \u201cor\u201d.)\nIn ordinary English, one and the same disjunction can be expressed in alternative ways. For\nexample, a disjunction that has the same subject term as \u201cJones is the employer or Jones is the\nowner\u201d might be equally well expressed as \u201cJones is the employer or the owner.\u201d The second\nexpression avoids the repetition of the common part of the disjunction which, in this case, is the\nsubject term Jones. The same procedure is followed in a disjunction where the predicate term is\nthe same. Thus, \u201cBrown is innocent or Smith is innocent\u201d can be expressed as \u201cBrown or Smith\nis innocent.\u201d The negation of a disjunction in English is often expressed by the phrase\n192 \"neither...nor.\" Thus, the negation of the disjunction, \u201cJones or Smith is the best player on the\nteam\u201d is expressed as \u201cNeither Jones nor Smith is the best player on the team.\u201d\n4. Conditionals: When two statements are joined by placing the word \u201cif\u201d before the first\nstatement and the word \u201cthen\u201d before the second statement, the compound statement resulting is\ncalled a conditional (also called an implication or an implicative statement or a hypothetical).\nExample: \u201cIf property taxes continue to rise, then retired people cannot afford to keep their\nhomes.\u201d The statement following \u201cif\u201d is called the antecedent (also called the implicans or\nprotasis) and the statement following \u201cthen\u201d is called the consequent (also called the implicate\nor apodosis). Examples of conditional statements in English that we will consider are:\n(1) If Mary gets her car repaired, then she will take a trip.\nantecedent consequent\n(2) If the snow melts in the mountains, then there will be flooding in the valley.\nantecedent consequent\n(3) If Jones is married, then she has a spouse.\nantecedent consequent\nIn ordinary English, the standard-form conditional \u201cIf Smith is President of the United States,\nthen he is over thirty-five\u201d can be expressed in various ways such as:\nIf Smith is president of the U.S., she is over thirty-five.\nSmith is over thirty-five if she is president of the U.S.\nSmith is over thirty-five, provided she is president of the U.S.\nOn condition that Smith is president of the U.S., then she is over thirty-five.\nSmith is over thirty-five in the case that she is president of the U.S.\nSmith is president of the U.S. only if she is over thirty-five.\n193 Smith is not president of the U. S. unless she is over thirty-five.\nUnless she is over thirty-five, Smith is not president of the U.S.\n5.Bicondionals: A compound statement in which the component statements are joined by the\nphrase, \u201cif and only if\u201d is called a biconditional. The components of a biconditional are called the\nright-hand component and the left-hand component.\nExamples:\nD. C. residents can have voting rights if and only if a majority of the states ratify the voting\nrights amendment.\nToday is Friday if and only if yesterday was Thursday.\nJohn is neither tall nor handsome if and only if John is not tall and John is not handsome.\nIV. Statement Connectives\nWe can identify the kinds of compound propositions enumerated above by the kinds of statement\nconnectives used to join the simple propositions into compound ones. Statement connectives\ncombine simple propositions into compound propositions. The five connectives are:\n1. Negation: not, it is false that, it is not the case that.\n2. Conjunction: and, but, while, likewise, etc.\n3. Disjunction: either...or, or\n4. Conditional: if...then, only if, unless, provided, etc.\n5. Biconditional: if and only if.\n194 V. Translation from Ordinary Language to Truth Functional Propositional Forms\nIf truth functional logic is to be useful, we must be able to translate statements and arguments\nexpressed in ordinary language into truth functional propositional forms. Having done so, truth\nfunctional logic provides us with techniques by means of which we may calculate the truth of\ncomplex propositions and the validity (or invalidity) of complicated arguments. That is why truth\nfunctional logic is also called the propositional calculus. A digital computer is itself only a logic\nmachine in which the operations of truth functional logic are performed by electrical circuits.\nComputers illustrate how systems of logic make it possible for us to organize large amounts of\ninformation and process it at speeds beyond ordinary conception.\nWhen statements are translated into the propositional forms of truth functional logic, component\nsimple propositions must be fully expressed. To illustrate, the statement\n(A ) Mary can dance and sing.\n1\nshould be rephrased as the compound conjunctive proposition\n(A ) Mary can dance and Mary can sing.\n2\nIn (A ) it is clear that the connective \u201cand\u201d joins two simple propositions, so that the original\n2\nstatement (A ) has the propositional form.\n1\n(A) p and q\nBut not all compound propositions have simple propositions as their only constituents. Often, our\nstatements involve diverse levels of compound propositions joined to other compound\npropositions by the truth functional connectives. Thus, the statement:\n195 (B ) Jones is neither poet nor philosopher if he can't appreciate jazz.\n1\nis a compound formed by joining two compound statements as follows:\n(B ) If Jones cannot appreciate jazz then Jones is not a poet and Jones is not a\n2\nphilosopher.\nThis helps make it clear that there are three simple propositions involved in the original\nstatement:\nSimple Propositions Abbreviations Variables\nJones can appreciate jazz M p\nJones is a poet N q\nJones is a philosopher O r\nThese simple propositions are compounded so that the negation of M is the antecedent clause of\na conditional proposition while the consequent clause is the conjunction of the negation of N and\nthe negation of O. Thus, B has the following form:\n2\nB. If not-M then (not-N and not-O).\nThis example illustrates how complex statements often have compound propositions joined to\nother compound propositions. Thus, careful analysis is needed in order to isolate the simple\npropositions and show how they are operated on by the truth functional connectives to produce a\ncorrect translation of the original statement.\n196 In order to facilitate extracting and combining simple propositions into compound propositions\nof different levels of complexity, the following distinctions between levels of propositions may\nprove useful:\nLevel 1 propositions - Simple propositions (e.g. p, q, r, s)\nLevel 2 propositions - Compound propositions formed by applying truth\nfunctional operations to level 1 propositions\n(e.g. not-p, p and q, p or q, if p then q, not-q).\nLevel 3 propositions - Compound propositions formed from lower level\npropositions, at least one of which is a level\n2 proposition. (e.g. p and (q or r), if p then\nnot-q).\nLevel 4 propositions - Compound propositions formed from lower level\npropositions, at least one of which is a level 3\nproposition (e.g. if p then (not- p and not-q)).\nLevel 5 propositions - Compound propositions formed from lower level\npropositions, at least one of which is a level 4\nproposition (e.g.. not-(if (not-p or q) then p).\nThus, all propositions with the form \u201cIf not-M then (not -N and not-O)\u201d are level 4 conditional\npropositions, with a level 2 negative proposition as antecedent and a level 3 conjunctive\nproposition as consequent.\nIn truth functional logic, non-standard connectives must be translated into the standard\nconnectives of truth functional logic. Thus, non-standard connectives such as \"but,\" \"while,\"\n\"however,\" \"even so,\" etc. are translated into the standard connective for the conjunction \"and.\"\n197 Likewise, phrases such as \"It is not the case that\u2026\" and \"It is false that\u2026\u201d are replaced by a\nstandard indication of negation, \u201cnot-\u2026\u201d And non-standard connectives used to form\nstatements of the form \u201cp only if q,\u201d \u201cq provided that p,\u201d \u201cq, on condition that p,\u201d etc. are\ntranslated into the standard conditional form \u201cif p then q.\u201d\nNon-standard statement connectives may often require the use of more than one standard truth\nfunctional connective, as with non-standard connectives such as \"p unless q\u201d and \u201cneither p nor\nq.\u201d Thus, \u201cp unless q\u201d translates into \u201cIf not-q then p.\u201d And \u201cNeither p nor q\u201d translates into\n\u201cNot-(p or q).\u201d While \u201cif p then q\u201d is a level 2 compound propositions, \u201cp unless q\u201d is a level 3\nproposition. Likewise, while \u201cp or q\u201d is a level 2 proposition, \u201cneither p nor q\u201d is a level 3\nproposition.\nIn Aristotelian logic, non-standard quantifiers such as \u201ceach,\u201d \u201cevery,\u201d \u201ca few,\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d are\ntranslated into the standard quantifiers \u201call\u201d and \u201csome\u201d to form categorical propositions. In\nmodern logic, we will see how \u201call\u201d and \u201csome\u201d are, in turn, translated into the universal and\nexistential quantifiers (\u00d7) and $\u00d7.\n198 4.A.1. Exercises:\nFor each of the following statements, specify its simple propositions and use T-F connectives to\nshow how the simple propositions are combined:\n1. Lewis and Clark are famous American explorers.\n2. Muhammad Ali is either big or fast.\n3. Unless Tom study, Tom will not pass the Logic course.\n4. Neither Tom nor Mary was present at the wedding. not (p or q)\n5. Mary is tired and hungry.\n6. Either the butler or the maid is the guilty person.\n7. Tom and Mary will attend the party on condition that it does not snow.\n8. Father went to work, while Mother stayed home.\n9. Tom will shoot himself if Tom is not careful.\n10. Mary will stay with relatives or with friends if she visits NYC.\n11. Tom will continue to gamble as long as he is winning.\n12. Although Sen. Whurmond is old, he is physically fit.\n13. Tom and Mary will reach their destination, provided they don't get lost.\n14. The house for sale is beautiful but costly.\n15. Mary will leave Tom only if Tom is not respectable.\n16. Whenever gasoline burns, there is oxygen.\n199 B. Symbolic Notation for Truth-Functional Statements.\nFormal logic is concerned primarily with the structure of statements and arguments as they are\ncharacterized within a particular formal system. Connectives such as \u201cnot,\u201d \u201cbut,\u201d \u201cwhile,\u201d\n\u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d \u201cunless,\u201d etc., are used in ordinary English with many connotations and meanings\nthat are not carried over into the system of truth-functional propositional logic. In order to avoid\nthe nuances and ambiguities these words have in their ordinary usage, they are replaced by\nsymbols that have precise rules determining how they are to be understood and used. Not only\ndoes the substitution of symbols for words help us to clarify statements, it also shortens the space\nand time needed to express long, complicated propositions.\nStatements that are translated into the formal systems of truth-functional propositional logic have\ntwo elements that are symbolized: (1) the distinct simple propositions used in the statement; and\n(2) the connectives used to form compound statements from the simple propositions. We will\nnow introduce rules for symbolizing these two elements.\nB.I. Symbols for Logical Connectives:\n1. Negation: \u201cnot\u201d is symbolized by a curl or tilde ( ~ ) .\n2. Conjunction: \u201cand\u201d is symbolized by a (\u2022).\n3. Disjunction: \u201cor\u201d is symbolized by a wedge (\u02c5).\n4. Conditional: \u201cif...then\u2026\u201d is symbolized by a horseshoe ( \u00c9 ).\n5. Biconditional: \u201cif and only if\u201d is symbolized by a triple bar (\u2261).\nObserve that logical connectives keep the same meaning wherever they occur much like the\nmathematical operators (-, +, \u00d7, \u00f7).\n200 Illustrating the use of the symbols we have:\n~ Jane is kind = It is not the case that Jane is kind.\nJane is kind \u2022 Bob is honest = Jane is kind and Bob is honest.\nJane is kind \u02c5 Bob is honest = Jane is kind or Bob is honest.\nJane is kind \u00c9 Bob is honest = If Jane is kind, then Bob is honest.\nJane is kind \u2261 Bob is honest = Jane is kind if and only if Bob is honest.\nII. Symbols For Component Simple Propositions:\nThe introduction of symbols for simple propositions is a very important step. Symbols shift our\nattention away from the actual meaning of the simple propositions we use and allow us to focus\ninstead on the kinds of relationships that exist between simple propositions. Thus, each of the\nfollowing statements has the same form, though their emotional and cognitive significance varies\ngreatly:\nStatement Statement Form\n(a ) It is not raining unless there are clouds\n1\nin the sky. not-P unless C.\n(a ) The Democrats will not win unless Black\n2\nAmericans turn out to vote. not-D unless B.\n(a ) The Democrats will not win unless Jewish\n3\nAmericans support them. not-D unless J\n(a ) Tom will not pass this course unless Tom\n4\nstudies. not-P unless S.\n201 (a ) Today is not Tuesday unless yesterday was\n5\nMonday. not-T unless M.\nThe abbreviated forms help us see that the general form for each of the above is:\n(a ) not-q unless p\n6\nAnd translation of the non-standard operator \u201cunless\u201d gives us:\n(a ) If not-p then not-q.\n7\nThus, the symbolic form of each of the above examples is\n(a) ~ p \u00c9 ~ q\nThe form represents a kind of relationship between two propositions and is independent of what\nthose propositions are about. To distinguish between simple and compound propositions, capital\nletters will be used to abbreviate simple propositions. Most often the letter will be derived from a\nkey idea in the sentence itself. Thus, in the example, \"Jane is kind,\u201d \u201cBob is honest,\u201d if we take\nthe key ideas to be Jane and Bob, then we can use the capital letter J as an abbreviation of \u201cJane\nis kind\u201d and B for \u201cBob is honest.\u201d We thus have: J \u2022 B as the abbreviation of the conjunction1.\nUsing these propositions as examples, we can illustrate the forms of the five kinds of truth-\nfunctional compound propositions as follows:\n1\nWe could have taken \"kind\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d to be the key ideas, in which case \u201cAl is kind\u201d would be abbreviated by\nK and \"Bob is honest\" by H. In general it makes little difference what letter we use to abbreviate a simple\nproposition so long as we use one and only one letter to represent one and only one proposition: wherever that\nproposition occurs that letter is substituted, and wherever the letter occurs, it stands for that proposition.\n202 Concrete Statements: Abbreviations\n1. Negation: It is not the case that Jane is kind. ~K\nJ\n2. Conjunction: Jane is kind and Bob is honest. K \u2022 H\nJ b\n3. Disjunction: Either Jane is kind or Bob is honest. K \u02c5 H\nJ b\n4. Conditional: If Jane is kind, then Bob is honest. K \u00c9 H\nJ b\n5. Biconditional: Jane is kind if and only if Bob is honest. K \u2261 H\nJ b\nB.II Propositional Schemata and Propositional Forms.\nThe abbreviations A \u00c9 B, C \u00c9 D, E \u00c9 F, etc., which stand for concrete conditional propositions\nhave a common logical form which can be schematized as _____\u00c9_____. Instead of using\nblanks to stand for any component proposition that may be used in such schemata, we will use\nsmall letters from the middle to the end of the alphabet, starting with p, then q, r, s, etc. Thus, the\npropositional form of any conditional sentence becomes p \u00c9 q. Let us illustrate the symbolic\nnotation of conditional statements:\nConcrete Statement Statement Form Propositional Form\n1. If Jane is kind, then Bob is honest. K \u00c9 H p \u00c9 q\nJ b\n2. If it rains on the lawn, the lawn gets wet. Lr \u00c9 Lw p \u00c9 q\nSummary of Compound Statement Forms:\n(1) Negation: ~ p, ~ q, etc.\n(2) Conjunction: p \u2022 q\n(3) Disjunction: p \u02c5 q\n203 (4) Conditional: p \u00c9 q\n(5) Biconditional: p \u2261 q\nIII. Logical Punctuation:\nIn both mathematics and logic, punctuation is necessary to make the meaning of symbolic\nexpressions precise. In mathematics, the result of (3 \u00d7 2 + 4) is unclear until the constituent parts\nare properly grouped. If they are grouped as ((3 \u00d7 2) + 4), then the result is 10; but when they are\ngrouped as (3 \u00d7 (2 + 4)), we get 18. Thus, when compound sentences become constituent parts\nof more complicated compound statements, it is necessary to group the constituent parts\ncorrectly to avoid ambiguity with respect to their meaning and truth-value. The need for\npunctuation is illustrated by the following ambiguous sentence:\nThe dance will be on Saturday and John will have a date or John will stay at home.\nThis sentence has the ambiguous propositional form p \u2022 q \u00da r. One way to clear the ambiguity is\nby placing a comma after \u201cdate,\u201d so that it reads:\nThe dance will be on Saturday and John will have a date, or he will stay at home.\nThis is symbolized as (p \u2022 q) \u00da r\nAnother way of clearing the ambiguity is to insert a comma after \u201cSaturday\u201d, so that it reads:\nThe dance will be on Saturday, and John will have a date or he will stay at home.\nThis sentence is symbolized as\np \u2022 (q \u00da r)\n204 Clearly, the proposition symbolized by (p \u2022 q) \u00da r is not identical in meaning to the proposition\nsymbolized by p \u2022 (q \u00da r).2\nBy using punctuation marks such as parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], and braces { }, it is possible to\nclearly state the alternative meanings of an ambiguous statement so as to determine which option\nis intended.\nAgain, compare the following punctuation: (1) ~ (p \u00da q) ; (2) ~p \u00da q. In (1), the negation sign\noperates on the compound statement, while in (2), it operates only on the simple proposition p.\nThe convention is that where there is no punctuation, the negation sign should be understood as\napplying to the nearest component.\nB.III. Logic Diagrams:\nAnother way of resolving the ambiguity involved in a statement like (p \u2022 q) \u02c5 r is by means of\nlogic diagrams. Logic diagrams provide a visual depiction of how simple propositions are\noperated on by logical operators to form compound propositions. Thus,\np ~ ~p\n4.1\nis the diagram showing how the proposition p is operated on to produce the compound\nproposition ~p. Likewise, the diagram\np\n\u02c5 p \u02c5 q\nq\n4.2\n2 When we do truth-tables we will see that when p is false and r is true, then ((p \u2022 q) \u00da r) will be true while\n(p \u2022 (q \u00da r)) will be false.\n205 shows how the simple proposition p and the simple proposition q are acted on by the operator v\nto produce the compound proposition p v q. In a similar fashion, the diagram\np\n\u00b7 p \u00b7 q\nq\n\u00c9 p \u00c9 q\np \u2261 q\n\u2261\n4.3\nshows how the simple proposition p and the simple proposition q are operated on by the\noperators \u2022, \u00c9, and \u2261 to produce the compound propositions indicated. We should note the\ndifference between diagrams:\np\n\u00c9 p \u00c9 q\nq\nq\n\u00c9 q \u00c9 p\np\n4.4\nLogic diagrams serve much the same function as parentheses: they indicate the order in which\nsimple propositions are compounded in order to form successive levels of compound\npropositions. The propositional form (p \u2022 q \u02c5 r) is ambiguous because it does not tell us whether\n206 p should be grouped with q and their compound grouped with r, or whether q should be grouped\nwith r, and then their compound grouped with p. It is ambiguous between the following two\npropositional forms:\na. (p \u2022 q) \u02c5 r\nb. p \u2022 (q \u02c5 r)\nTheir respective logic diagrams are as follows:\np\n\u00b7\nq \u02c5 (p \u00b7 q) \u02c5 r\nr\np\np \u00b7 (q \u02c5 r)\n\u00b7\nq\n\u02c5\nr\nFigure 4.5\nThese diagrams are a graphic representation of the order in which the logical operators are to be\napplied so as to produce an unambiguous propositional form.\n207 4.B.

Valid and Invalid Argument Forms.\nConsider the following argument:\n(la) If it is raining outside then there are clouds in the sky.\nIt is raining outside.\nThere are clouds in the sky.\nThe form of this argument is:\n(1) If p then q\np\nq\n211 This argument form is valid, which means, for any argument that has this form, if its premises\nare assumed true, then its conclusion must be accepted as true. This condition holds irrespective\nof the actual content of the component statements or of their actual truth-values. Thus, the\nfollowing argument is also valid:\n(lb) If Dallas is in California, then Paris is in Finland.\nDallas is in California\nParis is in Finland.\nOf course we know that the premises of argument (lb) are false, and that is why we do not accept\nits conclusion as true. But if the premises of (lb) were accepted as true, then we would have to\naccept its conclusion as true. That is the meaning of a valid argument: it is impossible for the\npremises of a valid argument to be true and its conclusion false.\nOn the other hand, an invalid argument is one with an argument form such that both premises\ncould be true, yet the conclusion false. Consider the following argument:\n(2a) If Jones is guilty, then he should be punished.\nJones is not guilty.\nJones should not be punished.\nAlthough the conclusion of this argument appears to follow \u201clogically\u201d from its premises (2a) is\nnonetheless an invalid argument, which means that the truth of the premises of that argument\ndoes not lead necessarily to the truth of its conclusion.\nTo see this, we must first extract the form of (2a) which is\n(2) If p then q\n~ p\n~ q\n212 The following argument has the same form:\n(2b) If it is raining outside, then there are clouds in the sky.\nIt is not raining outside.\nThere are no clouds in the sky.\nProviding an analogous argument where both premises of (2b) are true, yet the conclusion is\nfalse is a refutation. It proves that (2) is an invalid argument form and that (2a) is an invalid\nargument. Refutations prove that a particular claim does not necessarily follow from the\npremises given.\nBeyond constructing refutations by analogy, propositional logic provides us with other\nprocedures for determining when an argument expressed in truth-functional form is valid or\ninvalid. In what follows we will discuss two such methods: the Rules Method, the Truth-Table\nMethod, and the Natural Deduction Method. First we will present the rules for determining the\nvalidity of disjunctive and conditional syllogisms.\nC.II. Disjunctive Syllogisms.\nA disjunctive syllogism is an argument in which the first premise is a disjunction. There are two\ntypes of disjunctions: the exclusive and the inclusive. An example of an exclusive disjunction is\n\u201cJones is 20 years old or Jones is 21 years old.\u201d Here, Jones is one or the other age but not both\nages at once. With an exclusive disjunction, the truth of one disjunct excludes the possibility that\nthe other disjunct is true. In other words, both disjuncts cannot both be true at the same time.\nAn example of the inclusive disjunction is \u201cThe dog ran away or the dog was run over by a car.\u201d\nThis compound statement is true if either disjunct is true or if both disjuncts are true. Thus, the\ndog ran away or the dog was run over by a car or possibly both. An inclusive disjunction is false\nonly if both disjuncts are false. The sense of \u201cor\u201d that we shall use to represent disjunctive\nstatements is the inclusive sense.\n213 Let us now consider disjunctive arguments in which the first premise is an inclusive disjunction.\nIf we assume the first premise to be true, it means that one or the other or both disjuncts are true.\nBut if we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can validly infer that the other must be true.\nThis inference is illustrated in the following valid argument form:\np \u00da q (first premise)\n~p (second premise)\nq (conclusion)\nThe other valid argument form for a disjunctive syllogism is:\np \u00da q (first premise)\n~q (second premise)\np (conclusion)\nAgain, if the first and second premises are assumed to be true, then the truth of the conclusion\nnecessarily follows. If the first premise is true, then p or q is true or possibly both. And if the\nsecond premise is true, then q is false. It follows that p must be true.\nThe following examples illustrate these two valid argument forms:\nJones is friendly or Jones is deceptive.\nJones is not friendly.\nTherefore, Jones is deceptive.\nThis example has the valid argument form:\np \u00da q\n~p\nq\n214 The other example is:\nJones is friendly or Jones is deceptive.\nJones is not deceptive.\nTherefore, Jones is friendly.\nThis example has the valid argument form:\np \u00da q\n~q\np\nSome concrete arguments exhibiting invalid argument forms are:\n(1) Tom will sing or Tom will dance. p v q\nTom will sing. p\nTherefore, Tom will not dance. ~q\n(2) Tom will sing or Tom will dance. p v q\nTom will dance. q\nTherefore, Tom will not sing. ~p\n(1) and (2) are invalid because even if both premises are assumed to be true, the truth of the\nconclusion does not necessarily follow. Though it may be true that Tom will sing (second\npremise of the first example), it does not follow that he will not dance, since it is possible that\nTom will both sing and dance.\n215 We can now state the form of a valid disjunctive syllogism in terms of the following rule:\nII. RULE FOR A VALID DISJUNCTIVE SYLLOGISM\n1. AFFIRM THE DISJUNCTION in the first premise.\n2. DENY ONE DISJUNCT in the second premise.\n3. AFFIRM THE OTHER DISJUNCT in the conclusion.\nBy applying the rule we get a valid argument form:\n(1) affirm the disjunction p \u00da q (first premise)\n(2) deny one disjunct ~ p (second premise)\n(3) affirm the other disjunct q (conclusion)\nTo check the validity of a disjunctive argument, examine if in the second premise one of the\ndisjuncts has been denied and in the conclusion the other disjunct has been affirmed. If so, then\nthe disjunctive argument is valid.\nA violation of the rule would be a case where a disjunction is affirmed in the first premise, one\ndisjunct is affirmed in the second premise and the other disjunct is denied in the conclusion. This\nviolation of the rule is called the fallacy of affirming a disjunct.\nTo affirm a statement is to accept it as it is. One can affirm not only an affirmative statement but\nalso a negative one. To deny a statement is to affirm its negation. And one can deny both an\naffirmative and a negative statement. The following table illustrates the point:\nStatement Affirmation Denial\nP P ~P\n~P ~P ~ ~P\n216 More Than Two Disjuncts.\nSmith is tall or eccentric or athletic or intelligent.\nBut Smith is not tall or eccentric.\nTherefore, Smith is athletic or intelligent.\nThe argument form of this example is:\n(p v q ) \u00da (r v s) (first premise)\n~ (p v q) (second premise)\n(r v s) (conclusion)\nThe argument form is valid because it conforms to the rule that when we affirm a disjunction in\nthe first premise and we deny one of the disjuncts in the second premise, then we must affirm the\nother disjunct in the conclusion.\nSummary of valid disjunctive argument forms:\n1. p \u00da q 2. p \u00da q 3. ~p \u00da q 4. ~p \u00da q\n~p ~q ~~p ~q___\nq p q ~p\n5. p \u00da ~q 6. p \u00da ~q 7. ~p \u00da ~q 8. ~p \u00da ~q\n~p ~~q ~~p ~~q\n~q p ~q ~p\n217 All these argument forms are variations of the disjunctive syllogism: affirming a disjunction\nbetween two propositions, denying one of the disjuncts, and inferring the other disjunct.\nExercises:\n4.C.1. Use the Rules to determine which of the following disjunctive syllogisms are valid:\n1. X or Y 2. X or Y 3. Not-X or Y\nNot-X Y not-(not-X)\nY not-X Y\n4. Not-X or not-Y 5. A or not-B 6. Not-A or B\nNot-(not-Y) B Not-A\nNot-X A not-B\n7. A or B 8. A or not-B 9. Not-A or not-B\nNot-B not-B not-(not-A)\nA A not - not-B\n218 4.C.2. Exercises: Produce the syllogistic form for each of the following arguments, and\ndetermine if it is valid or invalid by the Rules:\n1. Tom\u2019s nervous tension is due to lack of sleep, too much smoking, too much coffee, or\noverwork. It is not due to overwork or to lack of sleep. Therefore, Tom\u2019s nervous tension is due\nto too much smoking or too much coffee.\n2. Mary\u2019s car failure is due to a dead battery(p) or an empty gas tank(q). The battery is dead.\nTherefore, it is not due to an empty gas tank.\n3. Capitalism makes rich people richer and poor people poorer or Capitalism exploits weaker\ncountries. It exploits weaker countries. Therefore, capitalism does not make rich people richer\nand poor people poorer.\n4. Nuclear war kills innocent people or nuclear war has no victors. Nuclear war has no victors.\nTherefore, it does not kill innocent people.\n5. Jones or Mary is the culprit. Jones is the culprit. Therefore, Mary is not the culprit.\n6. Saudi Arabia or Iran will raise the price of oil. Iran will raise the price of oil. Therefore, Saudi\nArabia will not raise the price of oil.\n7. Saudi Arabia will buy American F-15s or Saudi Arabia will cut off American oil supply.\nSaudi Arabia will not cut off American oil supply. So, Saudi Arabia will buy American F-15s.\n219 8. Israel's high inflation will worsen or Israel will request more American aid. Israel's high\ninflation will worsen. Therefore, Israel will not request more American aid.\n9. It is snowing or it is raining. It is snowing. Therefore, it is not raining.\n10. Tom is crying or Tom is happy. Tom is happy. Therefore, Tom is not crying.\n11. It will rain or it will snow. And since it will rain, therefore, it will not snow.\n12. Taxes will go up or go down. But they won\u2019t go down. So they'll go up.\n13. Tom will call Mary for a date or he will call Jane. Tom called Mary for a date.\nTherefore, he won\u2019t call Jane.\n14. The new coach must be tough or the team will fail. But the new coach is not tough.\nI conclude that the team will fail.\n220 15. Tom did not steal the money or he did not receive his inheritance.\nBut he did receive his inheritance. Therefore, he did not steal the money.\n16. John wrote the letter or it was forged. It wasn't forged. Therefore, John wrote it.\n17. The subway or the bus will be on time. The subway will be on time.\nSo, the bus won't be on time.\n18. The murderer is the man in the hat or the man with the umbrella. But the murderer is not\nthe man with the umbrella. Therefore, the murderer is the man in the hat.\n19. Tom will buy a shirt or Tom will buy a tie. Tom will buy a shirt.\nTherefore, Tom will not buy a tie.\n20. Rich countries will aid development in poor countries or rich countries will have chronic\nunemployment. Rich countries will not aid development in poor countries. Therefore, rich\ncountries will have chronic unemployment.\n221 C.III. The Conditional Syllogism\nWe consider here syllogisms where the first premise is a conditional proposition. An example is\nthe following:\nIf Ivanisha is a Russian, then Ivanisha drinks vodka. (first premise)\nIvanisha is a Russian. (second premise)\nTherefore, Ivanisha drinks vodka. (conclusion )\nRecall that in a conditional proposition, the clause following \u201cif\u201d is the antecedent while the\nclause following \u201cthen\u201d is the consequent.\nC.III.1. The Mood of a Conditional Syllogism.\nBefore we can determine which argument forms of the conditional syllogism are valid, we need\nto know what traditional logicians call its moods. The moods of the conditional syllogism are:\n1. The affirming mood (modus ponens), also called the positing mood.\n2. The denying mood (modus tollens), also called the sublating mood.\nA conditional syllogism is in the affirming mood if its second premise affirms the antecedent of\nthe conditional premise, and the conclusion restates, hence affirms the consequent of the\nconditional.\nThe symbolic form of this syllogism is:\np \u00c9 q\np\nq\n222 The following is another example of the affirming mood:\nIf she is not healthy, then she cannot play. ~p \u00c9 ~q\nShe is not healthy. ~p\nTherefore, she cannot play. ~q\nThis syllogism is in the affirming mood because the second premise affirms the antecedent and\nthe conclusion affirms the consequent.\nThe Denying Mood.\nA conditional syllogism is in the denying mood when the second premise denies the consequent\nclause of the original conditional, and the conclusion denies the antecedent of that conditional.\nFollowing is an example of a conditional syllogism in the denying mood:\nIf Ms. Ayandele is a Kenyan, then she is an African. p \u00c9 q\nShe is not an African. ~q\nTherefore, Ms. Ayandele is not a Kenyan. ~p\nObserve that the second premise denies the consequent and the conclusion denies the antecedent\nof the first premise. Thus, the syllogism is in the denying mood. To deny a statement is to affirm\nits negation.\n4.E.1. Valid Conditional Argument Forms.\nValid Argument Form in the Affirming Mood\nAny conditional syllogism in the affirming mood is a valid argument, and can be symbolically\nrepresented as follows:\np \u2283 q\np\nq\n223 Any argument having this structure is an instance of the argument form known as \u201caffirming the\nantecedent.\u201d In Latin, this valid argument form is called Modus Ponens. The four variations of\nthis valid argument form are:\nMP1 MP2 MP3 MP4\np \u2283 q ~p \u2283 q p \u2283 ~ q ~p \u2283 ~ q\np ~p p ~p\nq q ~q ~q\nRule for valid conditional syllogism in the affirming mood:\n(1) Affirm the Conditional (First premise) p \u00c9 q\n(2) Affirm the Antecedent (second premise) p\n(3) Affirm the Consequent (conclusion) q\nA violation of this rule, (namely, affirming the consequent in the second premise and affirming\nthe antecedent in the conclusion) is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\nC.III.2. Invalid Argument Form: Affirming the Consequent\nLet us take the following example:\nIf it rained, then the lawn is wet. (first premise)\nThe lawn is wet. (second premise)\nTherefore, it rained. (conclusion)\nIn this argument the second premise affirms the consequent rather than the antecedent, while the\nconclusion affirms the antecedent rather than the consequent. This argument can be symbolized\nas follows:\n224 p \u00c9 q (first premise)\nq (second premise)\np (conclusion)\nAny argument having this form is an instance of the invalid argument form \u201caffirming the\nconsequent.\u201d Variations of this invalid argument form are:\np \u2283 q ~p \u2283 q p \u2283 ~q ~p \u2283 ~q\nq q ~q ~q\np ~p p ~p\n4.C.1. Exercises:\nDetermine which of the following argument forms in the affirming mood are valid:\n1. p \u00c9 q 2. ~p \u00c9 q 3. p \u00c9 q 4. ~p \u00c9 q\nq ~p p q\np q q ~p\n5. p \u00c9 ~q 6. p \u00c9 ~q 7. ~p \u00c9 ~q 8. ~p \u00c9 ~q\np ~q ~p ~q\n~q p ~q ~p\n225 4.C.2.- Valid Argument Form in the Denying Mood\nConsider the following example:\nIf it is raining outside then there are clouds in the sky..\nThere are no clouds in the sky.\nTherefore, it is not raining outside.\nThe conditional is asserted in the first premise, the consequent of the conditional is denied in the\nsecond premise and the antecedent of the conditional is denied in the conclusion. The argument\nis valid because the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. The form of the\nargument is represented as follows:\np \u00c9 q (first premise)\n~q (second premise)\n~p (conclusion)\nAny argument having this structure is an instance of the valid argument known as \u201cdenying the\nconsequent\u201d (Modus Tollens). Variations of this valid argument are:\nMT1 MT2 MT3 MT4\np \u2283 q ~p \u2283 q p \u2283 ~q ~p \u2283 ~q\n~q ~q q q\n~p p ~p p\n226 I. Invalid Argument Form: Denying the Antecedent\nConsider the following example:\nIf my car breaks down in route, then I will be late for my appointment.\nMy car did not break down in route.\nTherefore, I was not late for my appointment.\nIn the second premise, the antecedent of the conditional is denied.. However, assuming that my\ncar did not break down in route does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. The non-\nfulfillment of the antecedent does not rule out the possible fulfillment of the conclusion by other\nsufficient conditions that could produce the same effect. For example, I could have been stopped\nfor speeding or delayed by heavy traffic or involved in an accident or \u2026, and so on. The\nforegoing argument can be represented as follows:\np \u00c9 q (first premise)\n~p (second premise)\n~q (conclusion)\nAny argument having this structure is an instance of the invalid argument known as \u201cdenying the\nantecedent\u201d. Variations of this invalid form are:\np \u00c9 q ~p \u00c9 q p \u00c9 ~q ~p \u00c9 ~q\n~p p ~p p\n~q ~q q q\nFrom the above observations, we can summarize the steps to follow to have a valid conditional\nsyllogism in the denying mood:\n227 Rule for valid conditional syllogism in the Denying Mood:\n(1) Affirm the Conditional (first premise) p \u00c9 q\n(2) Deny the Consequent (second premise) ~q\n(3) Deny the Antecedent (conclusion) ~p\nA violation of this rule, namely, the denial of the antecedent in the second premise and the denial\nof the consequent in the conclusion is called the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n4.C.2.

The Truth-Table\nThe truth-table method is a technique by means of which we can determine the validity of truth-\nfunctional argument forms. A valid argument form is such that if the premises are assumed to be\ntrue, the conclusion must be accepted as true. In other words, it is impossible for the conclusion\nto be false if the premises are assumed to be true. Therefore, if an argument has true premises but\na false conclusion, it must be invalid. The truth-table shows graphically whether it is possible for\nan argument form to have true premises and a false conclusion. If it is not possible for the\nargument form to have true premises and a false conclusion, then it is valid. The first step in\nlearning the method is learning to compute the truth-value of truth-functional compound\npropositions.\nD.I. Truth-Tables for Compound Propositions.\nThe truth-value of any statement is either true or false. The truth-value of a true statement is\ntrue and the truth-value of a false statement is false. Thus, the truth-value of the statement, \u201cJohn\nF. Kennedy was assassinated\u201d is true. But a propositional variable cannot be said to be true or\nfalse until a statement is substituted for it. Thus, a propositional variable, p, is neither true nor\nfalse until it is replaced by a statement like, \u201cJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated\u201d, which we\naccept to be true. Otherwise the variable p has no actual truth-value and two possible truth-\nvalues. This is graphically represented as follows:\np Propositional Variable\nT }\nPossible Truth-value\nF\nFigure 4.6\n236 This graphic device is called a truth table of one variable. Truth tables are devices that define the\nbasic operations of formal logic on propositions and their possible combinations. Each of the\nfive truth-functional operators mentioned earlier has a corresponding truth-table.\n(1) Negation\nDefinition: Negations are compound propositions formed from a simpler proposition.\nThe following truth-table for negation shows that negation of a true statement\nis false, and the negation of a false statement is true.\nII. Truth \u2013Table\np ~p ~(~p)\nRow 1 T F T\nRow 2 F T F\nFigure 4.7\nIt follows from this definition that the truth-value of ~(~(A)) is the same as the truth-value of A,\nand that the truth-value of ~(~(~A)) is the same as the truth-value for ~A. In general, an even\nnumber of negations leaves the truth-value unchanged while an odd number of negations\nreverses the truth-value.\np ~p ~~p ~~~p ~~~~p\nrow 1 T F T F T\nrow 2 F T F T F\nFigure 4.8\n237 The logical operators (\u2022, \u02c5, \u00c9, \u2261) are used to form compound propositions from two simpler\npropositions. In any compound proposition formed by using one of these operators, its two\nconstituent propositions will each be either true or false (T or F). This information is summarized\nin the following table:\np q\nRow 1 T T\nRow 2 T F\nRow 3 F T\nRow 4 F F\nFigure 4.9\nThese combinations are generated by means of binary tree diagrams:\np q\nT path 1\nT\nF path 2\nT path 3\nF\nF path 4\nFigure 4.10\nEach path of a tree diagram represents a possible way in which the truth-value of one of the\nconstituent propositions can be combined with the truth-value of the other constituent\nproposition. In the case of a compound proposition made up from three simple propositions, we\ncan use a tree diagram to generate all possible combinations of their truth-values as follows:\n238 p q r path\nT path 1\nT\nF path 2\nT\nT path 3\nF\nF path 4\nT path 5\nT\nF path 6\nF\nT path 7\nF\nF path 8\nFigure 4.11\nThis diagram presents all the possible ways in which the truth-values of three propositions can be\ncombined. And if actual statements are substituted for p, q, and r, then one of the eight paths\nrepresents the manner in which their truth-values are combined. This information can be\npresented in truth-table form as follows:\np q r\nrow\n1 T T T\n2 T T F\n3 T F T\n4 T F F\n5 F T T\n6 F T F\n7 F F T\n8 F F F\nFigure 4.12\n239 Each row of the table corresponds to the path with the same number in the tree diagram.\n(2) Conjunction (p \u2022 q)\nDefinition: A conjunction is true only if all its component statements\nare true. If p is true and q is true, then p \u2022 q is\ntrue, otherwise it is false.\nTruth-Table:\np q p \u2022 q\nT T T\nF T F\nT F F\nF F F\nFigure 4.13\n240 4. D.1.a. Exercises:\nDetermine the truth or falsity of the following conjunctions:\n1. (Washington, D. C. is the capital of the U.S.) \u2022 (Washington, D. C. is the capital of the U.S.).\n2. (Rome is the capital of Italy) \u2022 (Paris is the capital of France).\n3. (London is the capital of Ireland) \u2022 (Washington, D. C. is the capital of the U.S.).\n4. (A Nigerian is an African) \u2022 (A German is a European).\n5. (An Englishman is an Indian) \u2022 (A Japanese is a European).\n6. (Horses are mammals) \u2022 (Fish are mammals).\n7. (Barack Obama resigned the presidency) \u2022 (Donald Trump assumed the presidency).\n8. (Chinese are Asians) \u2022 (Ethiopians are not Africans),\n9. (Water is combustible) \u2022 (Gasoline is flammable).\n10. (Gold is a precious metal) \u2022 (Diamond is a metal).\n241 3. Disjunction (p \u00da q)\nThere are two types of disjunctions: exclusive and inclusive. An example of the exclusive\ndisjunction is \u201cEither Jones is in his office or he is in the classroom.\u201d Here the claim is that Jones\nis in one place or the other but not in both places at once. Thus an exclusive disjunction is true\nin case one of its disjunct is true, but false if both disjuncts are true.\nAn example of an inclusive disjunction is \u201cEither the dog ran away or the dog was run over by a\ncar.\u201d An inclusive disjunction is true if one of the disjuncts is true and is true if both disjuncts\nare true. In modern logic, the exclusive disjunction is typically defined in terms of the inclusive\ndisjunction. As such, we will confine this discussion of the disjunctive relation to inclusive\ndisjunctions.\nDefinition: An inclusive disjunction is true in case one or the other or\nboth disjuncts are true; it is false only if both disjuncts\nare false.\nTruth-Table:\np q p \u00da q\nT T T\nT F T\nF T T\nF F F\nFigure 4.14\n242 (4) Conditional (p \u00c9 q)\nDefinition : A conditional statement is false if the antecedent is true\nbut the consequent is false. In all other cases, the\nconditional is true.\nA conditional statement asserts that its antecedent implies its consequent: if p, then q. But note\nthat \u201cp then q\u201d does not assert categorically that q is true, but only that q is true on condition that\np is true.

For all other substitution instances of\np and q, p \u00c9 q is true.\n243 5. Biconditional (p \u2261 q)\nDefinition: If p and q both have the same truth-value, that is, if p and q\nare both true or both false, then p \u2261 q is true.\nIf p and q do not have the same truth-value, so that it is possible for one to\nbe true while the other is false, then p \u2261 q is false.\nThe following truth table illustrates the definition.\nTruth Table:\np q p \u2261 q\nT T T\nT F F\nF T F\nF F T\nFigure 4.16\n4.D.1 Exercise:\nAssume that A, B and C are true statements and X, Y, Z are false statements.\nUse truth tables to determine the truth or falsity of the following compounds:\n1.

Determining the Truth-Value of Truth-Functional Compounds:\nIf we are given the truth-value of the propositions being treated as simple, the truth-tables allow\nus to calculate the truth-value of any compound proposition constructed from them using logical\nconnectives.\nConsider the statement \u201cToday is not Wednesday and today is not Thursday.\u201d The simple\nstatements out of which the compound is formed are:\nTw = Today is Wednesday. Tth = Today is Thursday\nThe compound statement has the statement form\n~Tw \u2022 ~Tth.\n245 This has the propositional form\n~p \u2022 ~q.\nAll statements with this propositional form will have a truth-table which is constructed in\naccordance with the general format for building a truth table with two variables. The compound\npropositional form (~ p \u2022 ~q) is constructed from the two simple propositional variables p and q\nand each variable has two possible truth-values (either true or false). The following tree diagram\nshows that there are four possible combinations for two variables:\n4.15\np q\nT\nT\nF\nT\nF\nF\nFigure 4.17\nThe first step in building a truth table is to list all the possible combinations of truth-values for\nthe simple variables p and q.\np q\nRow 1 T T\nRow 2 T F\nRow 3 F T\nRow 4 F F\nStep 1 1\nFigure 4.18\n246 The second step is to determine the truth-value of the level 2 propositions, which are ~p and ~q.\nThe truth table for negation presented earlier tells us that if p is true, then ~p is false, and if p is\nfalse, then ~p is true. The same applies for q. The result of these operations can be shown in the\nfollowing manner.\np q ~p ~q\nT T F F\nT F F T\nF T T F\nF F T T\nFigure 4.18\nThe third step is to determine the truth-value of the level 3 propositions. In this case that is the\ncompound (~p \u2022 ~q ). We know from the truth-table for conjunctions that a conjunction is true if\nand only if both conjuncts are true. Applying this definition, we can now complete the truth-\ntable:\np q ~p ~q ~ p \u00b7 ~q\nT T F F F\nT F F T F\nF T T F F\nF F T T T\nSteps 1 1 2 2 3\nFigure 4.19\n247 This procedure could be condensed simply by carrying out each step beneath the appropriate\noperator in the proposition as follows:\n\u00b7\n~ p ~ q\nF T F F T\nF T F T F\nT F F F T\nT F T T F\nSteps 2 1 3 2 1\nFigure 4.20\nThe truth tables show clearly how the truth-value of a compound proposition is directly\ncalculated from the truth-values of its highest level constituent propositions. This can be shown\nby a logic diagram as well:\np ~\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 ~p ~q\nq ~\nFigure 4.21\nV. Building a Truth Table for three or more variables. For a compound form with three or more\nvariables, the same procedure as described above is followed, except that there are more steps.\nThus let us determine the truth table for the following statement: If the school has a good soccer\nteam, then either the coach is not a novice or most of the players are foreign students.\n248 The statement form for the above example is p \u00c9 (~q \u00da r), which is a conditional statement. The\nfirst step in building a truth table for this proposition is to list all the possible ways that three\npropositions could be true or false together. This set of possibilities (called \u201cpermutations\u201d) is\ngenerated by a tree diagram and determines the rows of the truth table as follows:\np q r p q r\nT T T T\nT\nF T T F\nT\nT T F T\nF\nF T F F\nT F T T\nT\nF F T F\nF\nT F F T\nF\nF F F F\nFigure 4.22\nEach path of the tree diagram is identical to a row in the truth table. And each row represents one\nof the possible ways that the simple propositions could be true or false together.\n249 There are 2 rows in a truth table of 1 variable, 4 rows in a truth table of 2 variables, and 8 rows in\na truth table of 3 variables. Adding an additional variable always doubles the number of rows.\nThus, a proposition containing n variables always generates a truth table with 2n rows. In the\ncomplete truth table, the total number of columns is the sum of the total number of simple\npropositions and the total number of logical operators.\nWe can use the logic diagram and truth table of the propositional form p \u00c9 (~q \u02c5 r) to illustrate\nthese relationships:\nLevel 1 2 3 4\np \u00c9 p \u00c9 (~q \u00da r)\nq\n~\n\u00da\nr\nLevel 1 2 3 4\np \u00c9 p \u00c9 (~q \u00b7 r)\nq\n~\n\u00b7\nr\nFigure 4.23\n250 \u00b7 \u00b7\np q r ~q ~q r p \u00c9 (~q r)\nT T T F F F\nT T F F F F\nT F T T T T\nT F F T F F\nF T T F F T\nF T F F F T\nF F T T T T\nF F F T F T\n1 1 1 2 3 4\nFigure 4.24\nThe condensed version is:\n\u00b7\np \u00c9 ( ~ q r )\nT T F T T T\nT F F T F F\nT T T F T T\nT T T F T F\nF T F T T T\nF T F T F F\nF T T F T T\nF T T F T F\n1 4 2 1 3 1\nFigure 4.25\n251 The rules for constructing a truth table for a level k proposition with n-variables are:\n1. Draw a tree diagram for n variables\n2. For each path of the tree diagram, write out the combination of truth-values as a row of the\ntruth table;\n3. Write out all level two propositions in the compound;\n4. Calculate the truth-values of each level 2 proposition for each row of the truth table;\n5. Write out all level 3 propositions in the compound;\n6. Calculate the truth-value of each level 3 proposition for each row of the truth table.\n7. Write out all level 4 propositions;\n:\n:\n:\npenultimate-steps.\nWrite out all k-1 level propositions and calculate their truth-\nvalues for each row of the truth table.\nfinal-step. Write out the k level proposition and calculate its truth-value for\neach row of the truth table.\n252 4D.3. Exercises:\nAssuming A, B, C are True and X, Y, Z are False, use a condensed version of the truth table to\ndetermine the truth-value of each of the following statement forms\n1. A \u00b7 B 11.

Tautologies, Contradictions and Contingencies\nA compound proposition that comes out true for all possible assignments of truth-values to its\nconstituent simple propositions is called a tautology. Thus, the compound proposition \"It is not\nthe case that John is at home and John is not at home\u201d has the propositional form ~ (p \u2022 ~ p) . Its\ntruth table is:\n~ ( p \u00b7 ~ p )\nLine (1) T T F F T\nLine (2) T F F T F\nSteps 4 1 3 2 1\nFigure 4.26\nAs we can see from lines 1 and 2, whether p is true or false, the compound statement comes out\ntrue. As this example illustrates, a tautology is true irrespective of the truth-value of its\nconstituent propositions.\nA compound proposition that comes out false for all possible assignments of truth-values to its\nconstituent simple propositions is called a contradiction. For example, the proposition \u201cMary is\nindustrious and May is not industrious\u201d has the propositional form \u201cp \u2022 ~p\u201d. Its truth table is:\n(p \u00b7 ~ p)\nLine (1) T F F T\nLine (2) F F T F\nSteps 1 3 2 1\nFigure 4.27\n254 Whether \u201cMary is industrious\u201d is true or false, the statement \u201cMary is industrious and Mary is\nnot industrious\u201d is false. A contradiction is false irrespective of the truth-value of its constituent\npropositions.\nA compound proposition is contingent if the truth-value of the compound proposition is changed\nwith changes in the truth-values of its constituent propositions. Thus, the proposition \u201cTom is\nhungry and Bill is not thirsty\u201d has the propositional form \u201cp \u2022 ~q\u201d and is false if p is false or q is\ntrue. It is true only when p is true and q is false. The truth table for the proposition is:\np q (p \u00b7 ~ q)\nLine (1) T T T F F T\nLine (2) T F T T T F\nLine (3) F T F F F T\nLine (4) F F F F T F\nSteps 1 1 1 3 2 1\nFigure 4.28\n255 4.D.4. Exercises: Use truth tables to determine which of the following compound\npropositional forms are contingent, contradictory, or tautological.\n1. p \u00c9 ( q \u00da p) 6. (p \u00c9 q) \u2261 (~p \u00da q)\n2. q \u00c9 (~p \u00da q) 7. (p \u2022 ~q) \u00da (p \u00c9 q)\n3.

[(p \u00da q) \u2022 p] \u00c9 q\n4.D Truth Tables for Arguments\nWhen arguments are constructed using simple propositions and truth functional compound\npropositions, it is possible to use truth tables to determine the validity or invalidity of the\nargument. We can determine the validity of such arguments by seeing whether the conclusion is\nnecessarily true when the premises are assumed true. This can be done by using truth tables for\ntruth-functional arguments.\n4.G.1. Truth Tables of Disjunctive Syllogisms\nLet us test the following disjunctive argument form:\np \u00da q (premise 1)\n~p (premise 2)\nq (conclusion) or p \u00da q. / ~p. // q\n256 To test the validity of the above argument form, we construct its truth table as follows:\nColumn 1 2 3 4\nConclusion Premise 1 Premise 2\np q p \u00da q ~ p\n(1) T T T F\n(2) T F T F\n(3) F T T T\n(4) F F F T\nFigure 4.29\nColumns 1 and 2 list all the possible ways that the variables p and q can be true and false\ntogether. Column 3 is filled in by reference to the first two columns in accordance with the\ndefinition of a disjunctive proposition. The fourth column, ~p, is filled in as the negation of\ncolumn 1.\nExamining the finished table, we see that only the third row shows both premises to be true. But\nthe conclusion here is also true. Thus, there is no case in which both premises are true and the\nconclusion false. The syllogism is therefore valid.\nLet us now consider the truth table for the following invalid argument:\nThe dog ran away or the dog was injured by a car.\nThe dog ran away.\nTherefore, the dog was not injured by a car.\n257 The argument form is as follows:\np \u00da q\np\n~ q or p \u00da q. / p. // ~q\nThe truth table for this form is as follows:\nPremise 2 Premise 1 Conclusion\np q p \u00da q ~ q\n(1) T T T F\n(2) T F T T\n(3) F T T F\n(4) F F F T\nFigure 4.30\nLine (1) proves the argument form invalid, for both premises are true but the conclusion is false.\nWhenever it is possible to demonstrate that an argument form can have true premises and a false\nconclusion, that argument form is proven to be invalid.\n258 4.G.1. Exercises:\nA. Use the truth-table method to determine which of the following argument forms are valid or\ninvalid.\n1. p \u00da q 2. p \u00da q 3. p \u00da q 4. p \u00da q\n~ q ~ p p q\np q ~ q ~ p\n5. ~ p \u00da q 6. ~ p \u00da q 7. ~ p \u00da q 8. ~ p \u00da q\np ~ p q ~ q\nq q p ~ p\n9. p \u00da ~ q 10. p \u00da ~ q 11. p \u00da ~ q 12. p \u00da ~ q\n~ p q p ~ q\n~ q p q ~ p\nB. Use the truth-table method to prove which of the following disjunctive\nsyllogisms are valid.\n1. Jones is the employee or the employer. Jones is not the employee. Therefore, he is the\nemployer.\n2. She is sick or is on leave. She is on leave. Therefore, she is not sick.\n3. Your behavior is either very rash or very stupid. It is very rash. Therefore, it is not very\nstupid.\n4. The store went out of business either because of poor management or because of poor\nsales. It was because of poor sales. Therefore, it was not because of poor management.\n5. The heater stopped working because the pilot light is out or because the blower is\ndefective. The pilot light is not out. Therefore, the blower is defective.\n259 6. Billy neither helps around the house nor contributes toward paying bills. Billy did not\nhelp around the house. Therefore, he contributed toward paying bills.\n7. Billy is a freeloader or a user of others. Billy is a user of others. Therefore, he is not a\nfreeloader.\n8. Mrs. Jones loves her son Billy or she punishes him. Mrs. Jones punishes her son.\nTherefore, she does not love her son.\n9. Billy avoids his responsibilities or is inconsiderate of others. He is not inconsiderate of\nothers. Therefore, he avoids his responsibilities.\n10. He will give her love or money. He gave her money. Therefore, he did not give her love.\n11. She is young or beautiful. She is not young. Therefore, she is beautiful.\n12. Eric Heiden will speed skate or Eric Heiden will bike race. Eric Heiden will speed skate.\nTherefore he will not bike race.\n13. Iran will surrender the hostages or America will be humiliated. Iran will not surrender the\nhostages. Therefore America will be humiliated.\n14. Third-world nations will be economically developed or America will become richer and\nricher. America is becoming richer and richer. Therefore, third-world nations will not be\neconomically developed.\n15. The University of Connecticut has a good women's basketball team or the University of\nConnecticut has a good men's basketball team. The University of Connecticut has a good\nwomen's basketball team. Therefore, the University of Connecticut does not have a good\nmen's basketball team.\n260 4.G.2 The Truth Tables of Conditional Syllogisms.\nConsider the following example:\nIf Ivan is a tiger, then Ivan eats meat.\nIvan is a tiger.\nTherefore, Ivan eats meat.\nThe argument form of the above example is represented thus:\np \u00c9 q (first premise)\np (second premise)\nq (third premise)\np \u00c9 q. / p. // q\nWe can test the validity of this argument form by constructing its truth table and examining it to\ndetermine whether there is a substitution instance in which the premises are true and the\nconclusion false. If we find such a case, then the argument form is invalid. If not, then the\nargument form is valid since in all its substitution instances, there is no case in which there is a\nfalse conclusion and true premises.\nPremise 2 Conclusion Premise 1\np q p \u00c9 q\n(1) T T T\n(2) T F F\n(3) F T T\n(4) F F T\nFigure 4.31\n261 We look for those lines in which the premises are both true. This occurs only in line (1). But\nnotice that the conclusion here is true. Therefore the argument is valid. Any argument of the\nform\np \u00c9 q\np\nq or p \u00c9 q / p // q\nis valid, regardless of what statements we substitute for p and q. For there is no substitution\ninstance in which the premises are true and the conclusion false. Medieval logicians called this\nvalid form Modus ponens.\nLet us next consider an invalid syllogism in the affirming mood.\nIf Amy eats crabs, Amy has an allergic reaction. p \u00c9 q\nAmy has an allergic reaction. q\nSo, Amy ate crabs. p\nConstructing the truth-table, we get:\nConclusion Premise 2 Premise 1\np q p \u00c9 q\n(1) T T T\n(2) T F F\n(3) F T T\n(4) F F T\nFigure 4.32\n262 Again, we look for a substitution instance in which both premises are true. We find this in lines\n(1) and (3). But the conclusion of line (1) is true. Hence, this line does not prove that the\nargument is invalid. On the other hand, the conclusion of line (3) is false. Thus, line (3) has true\npremises and a false conclusion, which proves that the argument is invalid. We conclude that any\nargument of the form\np \u00c9 q\nq\np or p \u00c9 q. / q. // p\nis always invalid. The fallacy involved in this form is called the fallacy of affirming the\nconsequent.\n4.G.2. Exercises:\nA. Use the truth table method to determine the validity of the following conditional argument\nforms.\n1. p \u00c9 q / ~q // p 2. p \u00c9 q / ~p // q 3. p \u00c9 q / p // ~q\n4. p \u00c9 q / q // ~p 5. ~p \u00c9 q / p // q 6. ~p \u00c9 q / ~p // q\n7. ~p \u00c9 q / q // p 8. ~p \u00c9 q / ~q // ~p 9. p \u00c9 ~q / ~p // ~q\n10. p \u00c9 ~q / q // ~p 11. p \u00c9 ~q / p // q 12. p \u00c9 ~q / ~q // ~p\nB.

You are over eating; therefore you will get a\nstomachache.\n263 2. If it snows hard, then I will not go to work. I will not go to work. So it must have snowed hard.\n3. If the sun shines, then we can play outdoors. The sun is shining today; so we can play outdoors\ntoday.\n4. If inflation continues, then I cannot afford to buy steaks. I cannot afford to buy steaks;\ntherefore inflation continues.\n5. If my team does not win, then I will eat my hat. My team did win; therefore, I will not eat my\nhat.\n6. Provided Jamie cleans her room, her mother will take her to the zoo. Her mother took her to\nthe zoo. Therefore, Jamie cleaned her room.\n7. If Billy helps around the house and contributes toward paying bills, then his mother will not\nlock him out. His mother locks him out. Therefore, Billy did not help around the house or Billy\ndid not contribute toward paying bills.\n8. If Mrs. Jones loves her son Billy, then she will not lock him out of the house. But she did lock\nhim out of the house. Therefore, Mrs. Jones does not love her son Billy.\n9. Unless Mrs. Jones prevents Billy from using her, then Billy will get into the habit of using\npeople. Mrs. Jones does prevent Billy from using her. Therefore, Billy will not get into the habit\nof using people.\n10. Billy will hurt himself, if he takes advantage of the people who love him. Billy hurts himself,\nbecause he takes advantage of the people who love him.\n11. Provided that Billy is not a freeloader, then he can live in his mother's house. Billy is a\nfreeloader. Therefore, he cannot live in his mother's house.\n264 12. You will get high blood pressure in case you do not exercise. You exercised. Therefore, you\nwill not get high blood pressure.\n13. On condition that Jane is honest, then Jane will have self-respect. Jane does have self-respect.\nTherefore, Jane is honest.\n14. If you look only to heaven for your riches, then you will have no riches on earth. But you do\nhave riches on earth. Therefore, you do not look only to heaven for your riches.\n15. If opportunity knocks at your door, then take advantage of it. You did not take advantage of\nyour opportunity. Therefore, opportunity did not knock at your door.\nQuantification\n4.H Quantifiers\n1. A propositional form, yx, becomes an actual proposition when we substitute the names\nof a specific property for the predicate variables, y, and the name of a specific individual for the\nindividual variable, x. Thus if the predicate, M1, is the property of being a mother, then M x = x\n1\nis a mother. And if the individual in question is f = Ms Flotmos, then M f = Ms Flotmos is a\n1\nmother. In this way, a proposition attributes specific properties to specific individuals. And it\nthen becomes either true or false. But this way of forming true or false propositions is limited.\nFor there are many true or false propositions that do not contain the name of any particular\nindividual, such as \u201cAll females are mothers,\u201d \u201cNo females are mothers,\u201d \u201cSome mothers are\nfemale,\u201d or \u201cSome mothers are not females.\u201d\nWith the addition of quantifiers, it is possible to express the A, E, I, and O propositional\nforms of traditional Aristotelian logic in terms of the propositional forms of modern truth\nfunctional logic. (x), which should be read \u2018for every x\u2019, is called the universal quantifier. This\n265 quantifier takes the place of \u201call\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in the Aristotelian system. ((cid:0)x), which should be read\n\u2018there exists an x\u2019, is called the existential quantifier, and takes the place of \u2018some\u2019 in the\nAristotelian system. The propositional forms of Aristotelian logic translate into the propositional\nforms of truth-functional logic as follows:\nAristotelian Truth-Functional Read (Boolean)\nA: All S are P (x) (Sx \u00c9 Px) For every x, if x is S then x is P.\nE: No S are P (x) (Sx \u00c9 ~ Px) For every x, if x is S then x is not P.\nI: Some S are P ((cid:0)x) (Sx \u00b7 Px) There exists an x such that x is S and x is P\nO: Some S are ((cid:0)x) (Sx \u00b7 ~ Px) There exists an x such that x is S not P\nand x is not P\nFollowing are examples of translations between Truth-functional and Aristotelian forms:\nT-F Form Read Aristotelian Form\n(x) Wx For every x, x is W All things are W.\n(x) ~Wx For every x, x is ~W No things are W.\n~ (x) Wx It is false that for every x, It is not the case that all things are W\nx is W\n~ (x) ~Wx It is false that nothing is W It is not the case that every x is not W.\n((cid:0)x) Dx There exists an x such that Something is D.\nx is D\n((cid:0)x) ~Dx There exists an x such Something is not D.\nthat x is not D.\n~ ((cid:0)x)Dx It is false that there exists It is not the case that something is D.\nan x such that x is D\n~ ((cid:0)x) ~Dx It is false that there exists It is not the case that something is not D.\nan x such that x is not D.\n266 4.H.1 Exercises:\nUsing quantifiers, translate each of the following categorical forms into truth-functional form.\n1. All individuals that are A\u2019s and B\u2019s are C\u2019s\n2. All individuals that are A\u2019s are B and C\n3. Only individuals that are A\u2019s are B\u2019s\n4. No individuals that are B\u2019s or C\u2019s are A\u2019s\n5. Every individual that does not vote is a free-rider.\n6. Few individuals that are A are B\n7. A few individuals that are A are B more exercises\n4.I. Mixed Quantifiers\nQuantifiers allow us to make true and false statements without referring to\nspecific individuals. The A, E, I, and O forms involve the use of quantifiers with\nmonadic predicates (applied to one individual). But quantifiers are also commonly used\nwith predicates that refer, not to a single individual, but to a relationship between two or\nmore individuals. These are called relational predicates. To illustrate, let f = Ms.\nFlotmos, and M1xy = x is the mother of y. If it is true that f is a mother, then it is true\nthat there exists someone to whom f is a mother of, even if we do not know who that\nindividual is. In truth-functional terms, M f \u00c9 ((cid:0)y)M fy. The following examples\n1 1\nillustrate how quantifiers are used with two-place predicates.\n267 Let b = Bill Clinton h = Hilary Clinton Lxy = x loves y.\nThen the following relations are translated as:\n1.

Thus M x (= x\n1\nis a mother) is a statement form that is neither true nor false because the variable x has no\nreferent. In such cases, we say that x is free. The statement form M x can become a statement in\n1\ntwo ways:\n(1) when the name of a specific individual is substituted for x. In such cases, we say that M x is\n1\ninstantiated Thus M b would be a false instantiation of M x. And M i would be a true\n1 1 1\ninstantiation of M x.\n1\n(2) when the variable x is quantified to make a universal or particular claim. Thus, (x)M x would\n1\nbe false and ((cid:0)x)M x would be true.\n1\nWhen we use quantifiers to make statement forms into statements, all variables used in the\nstatement must be bound by a quantifier. For a statement form to become a statement, each\nvariable used in the statement form must be either instantiated with an individual or bound by\nsome quantifier.\nExcercises:\nIn each of the following, indicate which variables are bound and which are free:\n(x) Mxy\n((cid:0)y) Mxy\n(y) (Mxy \u00c9 Myx)\n(y) (Ex) (Mxy \u00c9 Myx)\n(x) (Cxy\u00c9 Zfx)\nmore exercises\n270 Chpt. 5: Applications of Modern Logic\nLogic and Computers\nLogic and Probability\nLogic and Computers\n4.I.1 People normally process verbal information in much the same way it is processed in\ntruth-functional logic, and inferences such as \u201cP \u00c9 Q / P // Q\u201d are intuitively made and\nrecognized as correct. We will now indicate how devices such as calculators and computers are\nconstructed so that they process information in this manner. This is accomplished by first\nrepresenting propositions in terms of circuit diagrams.\n1. Let the propositional form P be represented by the following circuit:\nP\nElectricity can flow from beginning to end continuously if and only if gate P is down:\nP is down Path a-b is continuous\nT T\nF F\n271 2. Let the propositional form ~P be represented by the following inverted circuit:\n~P\nHere, the path is continuous if and only if gate P is not down:\nP is down Path a-b is continuous\nT F\nF T\n3. Let the propositional form (P \u00d7 Q) be represented by the following series circuit:\nP \u009f Q\nHere, the path from a to b is continuous if and only if gate P is down and\ngate Q is down:\nP (is down) and Q (is down) Path a-b is continuous\nT T T T\nT F F F\nF F T F\nF F F F\n272 4. Let the propositional form (P \u00da Q) be represented by the following parallel circuit:\nP v Q P\nQ\nIn this diagram, there is a continuous path from a to b in all cases except that in which it is false\nthat P is down and it is false that Q is down:\nP is down or Q is down Path is continuous\nT T T T\nT T F T\nF T T T\nF F F F\nWhen we envision the path from beginning to end as the circuit followed by an electric current,\nthe above diagrams are called switching circuits: diagram 2 is called an inverted circuit; diagram\n3 is called a series circuit; and diagram 4 is called a parallel circuit. By giving circuit analogues\nof the connectives ~, \u02c5, and \u00b7, it is possible to construct circuits that process electrical signals in\nexactly the same manner that compound propositions process truth values. The output of a circuit\nis determined by the combined operation of the switches in the same way as the truth value of a\ncompound proposition is determined by the operation of the truth functional connectives on the\natomic propositions.\n273 Some examples of circuit diagrams for compound truth functional propositions are as\nfollows:\nPropositional Form Circuit Diagram\nP Q\nP \u00b7 ~Q\n~P \u00b7 Q\n~P \u00b7 ~Q\nP \u00da ~Q\n274 \u2022\nP (~ P \u00da ~Q)\n4.I.1.

But by deriving propositional forms that are the equivalent of such\npropositions, it is possible to construct circuits that give equivalent outputs. The propositional\nform (P \u00c9 Q) is constructed from the simple propositions P and Q and has the following truth\ntable:\nP Q P \u00c9 Q\nT T T\nT F F\nF T T\nF F T\n275 To derive its disjunctive normal form, follow the steps below:\nStep 1. On each row where P \u00c9 Q is true, write down the simple\npropositions that are true and write down the negation of the\nsimple propositions that are false.\nStep 2. On each row where P \u00c9 Q is true, form the conjunction of the\nsimple propositions and the negations of the simple propositions as\ndetermined in Step 1.\nStep 3. Form the disjunction of the conjoined statements determined in Step 2.\nP Q P \u00c9 Q Step 1 Step 2\nT T T P Q P \u00d7 Q\nT F F\nF T T ~P Q ~P \u00b7 Q\nF F T ~P ~Q ~P \u00d7 ~Q\nStep 3 is then (P \u00d7 Q) \u00da (~P \u00b7 Q) \u00da (~P \u00d7 ~Q)\nBecause P \u00c9 Q has the same truth table as (P \u00b7 Q) \u00da (~P \u00b7 Q) \u00da (~P \u00b7 ~Q), they are\ntruth-functionally equivalent. P \u00c9 Q also has the same truth table as ~P \u00da Q. Thus\nP \u00c9 Q \u2261 (P \u00b7 Q) \u00da (~P \u00b7 Q) \u00da (~P \u00b7 ~Q) \u2261 (~P \u00da Q).\nThe DNF circuit diagram for P \u00c9 Q and all other statements that are truth functionally equivalent\nto it is thus:\n276 P Q\nAny compound of two propositions can be represented by a parallel circuit consisting of at most\nfour series circuits by constructing its DNF.\n4.I.2.

In computer language, a\nswitch is a \u201cblack box\u201d and only its input and output is considered relevant.

Logic diagrams indicate the order in\nwhich simple propositions are compounded in order to form successive levels of compound\npropositions. The propositional form (P \u00d7 Q \u00da R) is ambiguous because it does not tell us\n278 whether P should be grouped with Q and their compound grouped with R, or whether Q should\nbe grouped with R, and then their compound grouped with P. It is ambiguous between the\nfollowing two propositional forms:\na. (P \u00d7 Q) \u00da R\nb. P \u00d7 (Q \u00da R)\nTheir respective logic diagrams are as follows:\na. P \u00d7\nQ \u00da\nR\nb. P\n\u00d7\nQ\nR \u00da\nThese diagrams make clear the order in which logical operators are to be\napplied in order to produce an unambiguous propositional form.\n4.I.5.

Some arguments are inductive. But, unlike deductive arguments,\nan acceptable inductive argument is not one where the truth of the premises guarantees the truth\nof the conclusion. Rather, an acceptable inductive argument is one where the truth of the\npremises makes the truth of the conclusion more or less probable.\nPropositional and predicate logic shows how, from the truth values assigned to\nconstituent simple statements, the truth-value of compound statements formed from them can be\ncalculated. Probabilistic logic supplements truth-functional logic by showing how statements\nthat are only probably true can be combined into compounds whose subsequent probabilities can\nbe calculated. It provides us with a way of defining probabilities, a way of combining probability\nstatements, and a way of calculating the probability of compound statements. The modern theory\nof probability provides the foundation of inductive logic.\n284 A. PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE\nI. The Modern Theory of Probability\nFrom time immemorial, human beings have attempted to benefit themselves by taking\nrisks, hoping to succeed where others may have failed. Businessmen, traders, gamblers, and\nlovers are known for taking chances on uncertain outcomes. But while lovers typically do not\nact rationally, businessmen and serious gamblers do. And being rational means making choices\nthat have the highest expectation of success and avoiding choices that have the lowest\nexpectation of success.\nGamblers are particularly shrewd observers of games of chance where wealth is wagered,\nwon, and lost. Much of the modern analysis of chance and probability comes from the\nobservations and conjectures of gamblers, many of whom appealed to contemporary\nmathematicians for help in deciding what bets to make and what bets to avoid. In the 13th\ncentury, King Alfonso of Castile (1221-1284) produced seven treatises on dice and other games\nof chance. In the 16th century, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) wrote Liber de Ludo Aleae (The\nBook on Games of Chances), one of the first written outlines of modern probability.3 Cardano\u2019s\naim was to show how to calculate the probability of outcomes in games of chance so that bettors\ntruly had equal chances of winning. Cardano\u2019s cryptic remarks prefigure what became the\nmathematical theory of probability where the probability of E, Pr(E), is defined as follows:\n3 Cardano was one of the most famous physicians of his age, but he was also a gambling addict, as were many of the\naristocracy. He confessed to \u201cimmoderate devotion to table games and dice\u2026.During many years I have played not\noff and on but, as I am ashamed to say, every day.\u201d Bernstein, Peter L. Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of\nRisk. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1996. Print. p. 45\n285 Let n(G) = the total number of outcomes in the game;\nn(E) = the total number of outcomes in the game that are E.\nThen, if each outcome is equally likely,\nPr (E) = n (E) / n (G).\nIn the mathematical theory of probability, the probability of an event E in game G is the\nnumber of outcomes describable as E, divided by the total number of possible outcomes in G. In\nother words, the probability that E is true, Pr(E), is based on the proportion of events in our\nuniverse of discourse G that are E events. Pr(E) can range from a value of zero, which means\nthere is total certainty that E will be false; to a value of one, which means that there is total\ncertainty that E will be true. This is expressed as 0 \u2264 Pr(E) \u2264 1.\nIt may seem paradoxical that by using probabilities we can know what to expect, even when the\noutcome is a matter of chance. Flipping a coin is one model of choice by chance. There are 2\npossible outcomes, H or T, and any flip produces either H up or T up, but not both. Thus,\nPr(H) = Pr(T) = 1/2\nSuppose A bets B that the coin will land H up, and B accepts the bet. If the coin is randomly\nflipped, and lands H up, then A wins. (If the coin is randomly flipped, and lands T up, then B\nwins.) The is a fair bet because each participant had an equal chance of winning. If A were a\nwealthy merchant and B an impoverished beggar, we might be appalled at the justice of the\nwealthy person gaining at the expense of the poor person who loses, but the bet was fair.\n[references to the ethics of gambling]\nThrowing a die is another model of choice by chance. There are 6 possible outcomes, and any\nthrow is either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 (but not more than one of these):\nPr(1) = Pr(2) = Pr(3) = Pr(4) =Pr(5) = Pr(6) = 1/6\nEach number on a die is either even or odd: E(2,4,6) or O(1,3,5). Thus, in throwing a single die,\nthere are two kinds of outcome: even or odd number up, but not both:\n286 Pr(E) = Pr(O) = 3/6 = \u00bd\nDrawing a card from a standard deck that has been shuffled is another model of choice by\nchance. A standard deck consists of 52 distinct cards divided into 4 kinds (suites). Therefore the\nprobability of drawing any particular card is 1/52:\nPr(9H) = Pr(6C) = Pr(2D) = Pr(7S) = 1/52.\nThere are 4 kinds of outcome: Heart (H), Diamond (D), Spade (S), or Club (C). Since each kind\nhas 13 members,\nPr(H) = Pr(D) = Pr(S) = Pr(C) = 13/52 = 1/4\nIn each of the above examples, each kind of event has an equal chance of occurring. But there\nare other cases where the different kinds of events in the game may have different chances of\noccurring. An example would be a roulette wheel (urn of marbles), on which there are 10\n(G)reen, 20 (W)hite, 30 (R)ed, and 40 (B)lack slots (marbles). This gives a total of 100\npossibilities (slots,marbles). If we turn (shake) the wheel (urn) and randomly choose a slot\n(marble) on the wheel (from the urn), the probability of picking a slot (marble) with a certain\nkind of color would be:\nPr(G) = 10/100 = 1/10\nPr(W) = 20/100 = 2/10\nPr(R) = 30/100 = 3/10\nPr(B) = 40/100 = 4/10\nThough each individual has an equal chance of being chosen, certain kinds of events are more\nlikely than others.\nIn the example with cards, there are four kinds of cards, and each kind has thirteen instances.\nThus, Pr(H) = Pr(D) = Pr(S) = Pr(C) = 1/4. But in the roulette wheel example, while there are\nfour kinds of events, each kind has a different number of individual instances. Thus,\nPr(R) \u2260 Pr(W) \u2260 Pr(B) \u2260 Pr(G).\n287 When multiple choices are made from the same deck, we must distinguish choice with\nreplacement of the card chosen from choice without replacement of the card chosen. Thus,\nwith a deck of 52 cards, Pr(8D) = 1/52 and Pr(D) = 13/52 = 1/4. If 8D is chosen, and replaced,\nthen Pr(8d) remains 1/52 and Pr(D) = 13/52 = 1/4. But if 8D is not replaced, then on the next\nchoice, Pr(8D) = 0 and Pr(D) = 12/51.\n5.A.1. Probability Exercises for Games of Chance:\nA.

The Relative Frequency Theory of Probability\nThe definition of probability we have developed using games can be extended to events\nthat are not parts of a game. The probability of many kinds of events in everyday life, business,\nand science can be estimated using the frequency of past events to estimate the probability of\nsimilar events in the present and future. Suppose there were 10,000 auto accidents in City A over\nthe last five years, and 9,000 of them involved drivers 20-30 yrs. old, 800 between 30-40, 100\nbetween 40-50 yrs. old, 50 between 50-60 yrs. old, 30 between 60 -70 yrs. old, and 20 were > 70\nyrs. old. We calculate the probabilities of Auto Accidents in A for each age group as follows:\na. Pr(AA20-30) = 9,000/10,000 = 900/1000\nb. Pr(AA30-40) = 800/10,000 = 80/1000\nc. Pr(AA40-50) = 100/10,000 = 10/1000\nd. Pr(AA50-60) = 50/10,000 = 5/1000\ne. Pr(AA60-70) = 30/10,000 = 3/1000\nf. Pr(AA>70) = 20/10,000 = 2/1000\nIf city A in the next year is pretty much the same as city A in the previous years, and an\nautomobile accident takes place in City A, it is highly probable that a 20-30 yr. old was involved,\nand highly unlikely that someone >70 was involved. If insurance company C1 has a high\npercentage of 20 yr. olds, then it should expect to pay more auto insurance claims than a\ncompany, C2, that has a higher percentage of 50 yr. olds. Accordingly, premiums or deductibles\nmight have to be higher at firm C1 than at firm C2. Or, C1 may keep lower rates but introduce\ntougher requirements.\nFire insurance rates are determined in similar fashion. Suppose that for the last 10,000\naccidental house fires, 8000 were in houses >70 yrs. old, 1000 were in houses 60-70 yrs. old, 800\n290 were in houses 50-60 yrs. old, 100 were in houses 40-50 yrs. old, 50 in houses 30-40 yrs. old, 30\nin houses 20-30 yrs. old, and 20 in houses <20 yrs. old.\nYrs. old # fires Probability of accidental house fire\na. < 20 20 20/10,000\nb. 20-30 30 30/10,000\nc. 30-40 50 50/10,000\nd. 40-50 100 100/10,000\ne. 50-60 800 800/10,000\nf. 60-70 1000 1000/10,000\ng. >70 8000 8000/10,000\nIf history has shown that older houses have a higher probability of catching fire, then premiums\nor deductibles on older houses are likely to be higher than those on more recently built houses.\nThe insurance company wagers that the total premiums they collect will exceed their total\npayouts for claims. The insurance company is not making a fair bet. The insurance company is\nmaking a bet where the odds are in it\u2019s favor, in order to produce a profit.\nThe above scenarios use a relative frequency theory of probability, where the\nprobability of an event E is determined by the frequency with which E has occurred in the past,\nrelative to the total number of all A cases:\nn(A) = number of all past outcomes of A;\nn(E) = number of past outcomes of A\u2019s that are E,\nPr (E) = n(E)/n(A)\n291 In estimating the relative frequency of A\u2019s that are E, n(E), it is easy to be misled by the\navailability and vividness of the events we take notice of. There is, for instance, a tendency to\noverestimate the frequency of events that are described in personal terms, and underestimate the\nfrequency of events described by impersonal statistical data. Despite the data that Yototas have\nthe highest repair rate, Phyllis may believe Yototas are good cars because her cousin has one,\nand likes it a lot.\n5.A.2. Probability Exercises for Relative Frequencies:\n1) Let each sample consists of 10 consecutive flips. Record the relative frequencies of H and\nT in each sample.\n2) Place a piece of clear tape on the H side. Record the relative frequencies in 10 throws.\n3) In the last year (365 days) the precipitation was 70 days of (ra)in, 61 days of (sn)ow, 40\ndays of (sl)eet, and 10 days of (ha)il. For that year, what was:\na) Pr(Ra)\nb) Pr(Sn)\nc) Pr(Sl)\nd) Pr(Ha)\nThe modern theory of probability derives from using games to provide objective\nmeasures of what we should expect, based on the particular parameters of the game used (coins,\ndice, cards, roulette, ..). But in calculating relative frequencies, we are often called upon to give\nprobability estimates of events that are not as well defined as the events within a game. To\nillustrate, determining whether a fire was accident or arson is not like determining whether two\n292 dice fall showing snake-eyes4 or whether five cards are a flush (all of the same suit). Part of the\nproblem in deciding what will be counted as an accidental fire is that the criteria for whether\nsomething is accidental or not has changed (witchcraft, sorcery, divine curse, lightning,\nelectrical short circuit, spontaneous combustion). We are also sometimes called upon to give\nprobability estimates of events that have not occurred in the past. Thus, how probable is it that a\nman will become pregnant and give birth to a child within the next 5 yrs., within the next 20 yrs.,\nwithin the next 100 yrs.? Such estimates involve factors that often may differ from person to\nperson.\n4 (1,1)\n293 III. Rules for Calculating Probabilities\nOnce the probabilities of our simple propositions have been determined, we can calculate the\nprobabilities of compound propositions formed from them using the truth-functional connectives\nfor negation, conjunction, and disjunction.\nNegation Rule: Pr (~A) = 1 - Pr (A)\nPr (A) = n(A)/ n(G)\nPr (~A) = n(~A)/ n(G)\n1 = n(A) + n(~A) / n(G) = n(A) / n(G) + n(~A) / n(G) = Pr(A) + Pr(~A)\nGiven 1 = Pr(A) + Pr(~A), the Negation Rule follows:\n1 \u2013 Pr (A) = Pr (~A).\nIn throwing a white die, W, with six sides numbered 1 through 6, Pr(W2) = 1/6. Thus,\nPr(~W2) = 1 \u2013 Pr(W2) = 1 \u2013 1/6 = 5/6.\nThe odds that E will occur is the ratio of E events to ~E events:\nO(E) = n(E) : n(~E)\nSince n(G) = n(E) + n(~E), the odds tell us how often we can expect E events relative to ~E\nevents. If n(E) is greater than n(~E), then betting on E is more likely to produce wins than betting\non ~E. On the other hand, if n(E) is less than n(~E), then betting on ~E is more likely to produce\nwins than bets on E. Thus, O(W2) = 1:5 and O(~E) = 5:1. When n(E) \u00b9 n(~E), payoffs have to\nbe adjusted in order to make the bet fair.\n294 5.A.3. Exercises on determining simple probabilities and odds with a deck of 52 cards:\n1. J proposes to K: If you are dealt a Heart then I\u2019ll give you $1. If you are not dealt a\nHeart, then you give me $1. Is this a fair bet?\n2. Without wild card:\na. P(H) =\nb. Pr(~H) =\nc. O(H:~H) =\n3. With 1 wild card:\na. P(H) =\nb. Pr(~H) =\nc. O(H:~H) =\n4. Suppose Joan receives $1 each time she throws W2 and pays $1 each time she does not\nthrow W2 with a fair die. Is this a fair bet?\na. Pr(W2) =\nb. Pr(~W2) =\nc. O(W2: ~W2) =\n5. Drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards:\na. Pr(A) =\nb. Pr(~A) =\nc. O(A:~A) =\n295 6. Suppose we are given 6 bananas, 7 oranges, 8 apples, and 9 peaches, each in a box that is\nindistinguishable from the other boxes. Determine the following values:\na. Pr(B) = Pr(~B) = O(B: ~B) =\nb. Pr(O) = Pr(~O) = O(O: ~O) =\nc. Pr(A) = Pr(~A) = O(A: ~A) =\nd. Pr(P) = Pr(~P) = O(P: ~P) =\nConjunction Rule: Pr (A \u00b7 B) = Pr (A) x Pr (B)\nwhere A and B are independent events\nThe probability of a conjunctive compound is the product of the probabilities of each\nconjunct, so long as the conjuncts are independent of one another. Two outcomes, A and B, are\nindependent of one another if the occurrence of one has no influence on the occurrence of the\nother. We can illustrate this with the example of throwing a white die (W) and a black die (B).\nThrows of the white die, W: W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6.\nThrows of the black die, B: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6.\nThe probability of throwing W2 is 1/6. The probability of throwing B5 is 1/6. Thus, the\nprobability of throwing W2 and B5 is:\nPr (W2 \u00b7 B5) = Pr (W2) x Pr (B5) = 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36.\nBut this is only because the occurrence of W2 is independent of the occurrence of B5.\nMany situations are such that what happens on one occasion can affect the probability of what\nhappens subsequently. In a deck of cards, there are 13 hearts, 13 diamonds, 13 clubs, and 13\nspades, giving a total of 52 cards. The probability of pulling a heart on the first draw is\n296 n(H)/n(cards) = 13/52. However, the probability of pulling a heart on the second draw is 13/52 if\nthe first card was replaced, but is 13/51 if the first card was not a heart and was not replaced; and\nis 12/51 if the first card was a heart and was not replaced. Given two outcomes, if the first\noutcome, A, alters the probability of the second outcome, B, then A and B are not independent.\nIn cases where A and B are events that are not independent, the Conjunction Rule as given above\ncan not be applied, and must be expressed as follows:\nExpanded Conjunction Rule: Pr(A \u009f B) = Pr(A) x Pr(B given A)\nDisjunction Rule: Pr (A v B) = Pr (A) + Pr (B)\nwhere A and B are exclusive events\nThe probability of a disjunctive compound is the sum of the probabilities of each disjunct, so\nlong as the disjuncts are exclusive. Recall that \u2018v\u2019 allows for inclusive disjuncts, where both\ndisjuncts may be true. But the disjunction rule in probability is only applicable for exclusive\ndisjuncts, where if one of the disjuncts is true, then all other disjuncts must be false.\nThrowing a single die illustrates the application of the disjunction rule. A die (W) has six\nsides \u2013 W1,W2,W3,W4,W5,W6 \u2013 and they are mutually exclusive. If the die falls showing a\nparticular number, it can show none of the other numbers on that throw. Thus, the probability\nthat W will show a 2 or a 5 on a single throw is\nPr (W2 v W5) = Pr (W2) + Pr(W5) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.\nAnd the probability that a single die will show a 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 on a single throw is\nPr (W1 v W2 v W3 v W4 v W5 v W6) =\nPr (W1) + Pr (W2) + Pr (W3) + Pr (W4) + Pr (W5) + Pr (W6) =\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1\n297 Now suppose we are throwing, not one, but two dice: one white and one black. Then all\npossible combinations are:\nW1B1 W2B1 W3B1 W4B1 W5B1 W6B1\nW1B2 W2B2 W3B2 W4B2 W5B2 W6B2\nW1B3 W2B3 W3B3 W4B3 W5B3 W6B3\nW1B4 W2B4 W3B4 W4B4 W5B4 W6B4\nW1B5 W2B5 W3B5 W4B5 W5B5 W6B5\nW1B6 W2B6 W3B6 W4B6 W5B6 W6B6\nThe probability of throwing a 2 with the white die or of throwing a 5 with the same die on a\ngiven throw is\nPr (W2 v W5) = Pr (W2) + Pr (W5) = 1/6 + 1/6.\nBut the probability of throwing a 2 with the white die or of throwing a 5 with the black die is not\nPr (W2 v B5) = Pr (W2) + Pr (B5) = 1/6 + 1/6.\nThis is because throwing W2 excludes the possibility of throwing W5 on that throw. But\nthrowing W2 does not exclude the possibility of also throwing B5. Both W2 and B5 may occur\non the same throw. W2 and W5 are exclusive. W2 and B5 are not exclusive.\nIn cases where A and B are not exclusive events, the disjunction rule is:\nExpanded Disjunction Rule: Pr(A or B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) \u2013 Pr(A \u00d7 B)\nThus, the probability of W2 or B5 when throwing two dice is\nPr(W2 v B5) = Pr(W2) + Pr(B5) \u2013 Pr(W2 \u00d7 B5) =\n(6/36 + 6/36) \u2013 [Pr(W2) x Pr(B5)] = 12/36 \u2013 1/36 = 11/36.\nEach of the 36 possible combinations of throwing two dice has an equal probability of occurring,\nwhich is 1/36. But when the outcomes of rolling 2 dice are grouped in terms of their sums, the\nprobabilities of those sums are not equal.\n298 Let the number of black and white pairs that sum to k be called n(sum k). Then\nn(sum k) = the number of pairs that sum to k.\nAnd the 36 combinations of throwing two dice produce sums from 2 through 12 are as follows:\nSum 2 = (W1,B1)\nSum 3 = (W1,B2), (W2,B1)\nSum 4 = (W1,B3), (W2,B2), (W3,B1)\nSum 5 = (W1,B4), (W2,B3), (W3,B2), (W4,B1)\nSum 6 = (W1,B5), (W2,B4), (W3,B3), (W4,B2), (W5,B1)\nSum 7 = (W1,B6), (W2,B5), (W3,B4), (W4,B3), (W5,B2), (W6,B1)\nSum 8 = (W6,B2), (W5,B3), (W4,B4), (W3,B5), (W2,B6)\nSum 9 = (W6,B3), (W5,B4), (W4,B5), (W3,B6)\nSum 10 = (W6,B4), (W5,B5), (W4,B6)\nSum 11 = (W6,B5), (W5,B6)\nSum 12 = (W6,B6)\nIf n(sum k) = the number of B and W pairs that sum to k, then\nn(sum 2) = 1 n(sum 3) = 2 n(sum 4) = 3 n(sum 5) = 4,\nn (sum 6) = 5 n(sum 7) = 6 n(sum 8) = 5 n(sum 9) = 4,\nn(sum 10) = 3 n(sum 11) = 2 n(sum 12) = 1 .\n299 Thus,\nPr (sum2) = 1/36 Pr (sum3) = 2/36 Pr (sum4) = 3/36\nPr (sum5) = 4/36 Pr (sum6) = 5/36 Pr (sum 7) = 6/36\nPr( sum8) = 5/36 Pr( sum9) = 4/36 Pr( sum10) = 3/36\nPr( sum11) = 2/36 Pr( sum12) = 1/36\nThe probability of each individual outcome of rolling two dice is 1/36. But the probabilities of\nthe sums of the two dice are not equal. Thus, Pr(W2,B2) is different from Pr(sum 4) because\nthere is only one way for the two dice to simultaneously show a 2, but there are three ways that\ntwo dice can sum to 4: (W1,B3), (W2,B2), (W3,B1). This is why an even money bet on rolling a\n(2,2) is not as good as an even money bet on rolling a sum 4.\n5.A.4. Exercises on negation, conjunction, disjunction:\n1.

Show why an even money bet on rolling a sum 4 is not as good as an even money bet on\nrolling a sum 7.\n301 Origins of The Modern Theory of Probability\nAround the year 1605, the founder of modern science, Galileo Galilee, was asked by his\npatron, the Grand Duke Cosmo II, for help in solving the following gambling problem:\n\u201cThree dice are thrown: \u2026 long observation has made dice players consider (sum) ten to be\nmore advantageous than (sum) nine. Why?\u201d\nProceeding as Cardano had indicated, Galileo listed all the 63 (=216) possible combinations of 3\ndice, and then listed those combinations that produce 9 when summed, and those combinations\nthat produce 10 when summed. He showed that there were 25 combinations which summed to 9,\nand 27 combinations that summed to 10.5 Thus\nPr (sum 9) = 25/216 Pr (sum 10) = 27/216.\nIn a circuit of 216 throws, 3 dice will sum 10 more often than they sum 9 (on the average),\nconfirming the Grand Duke\u2019s suspicion.\nAnother 17th century gambling enthusiast, the Chevalier de Mere (1607-1684), would bet\neven money that he could get at least one six in every four rolls of a die. This seemed counter-\nintuitive because we would expect, on the average, one six in every six throws of a die. Thus, de\nMere was able to entice many to bet against him. But de Mere\u2019s conjecture proved correct, and\nhe won a considerable amount of money on the wager.\nWhat is the probability that 6 will turn up in four throws of a six sided die? Let 6 = 6 on\n1\nthrow 1 and 6 = 6 on throw n. Then it is tempting to represent this problem as follows:\nn\nPr(6 or 6 or 6 or 6 ) = Pr(6 ) + Pr(6 ) + Pr(6 ) + Pr(6 ) =\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.\n5\nFor 9, (1,2,6) appears 6 times,(1,3,5)appears 6 times, (1,4,4) appears 3 times, (2,2,5) appears 3 times, (2,3,4)\nappears 6 times, (3,3,3) appears 1 time. So throwing a total of 9 can appear 25 times in all; For 10, (1,3,6) appears 6\ntimes,(1,4,5)appears 6 times, (2,4,4) appears 3 times, (2,2,6) appears 3 times, (2,3,5) appears 6 times, (3,3,4) appears\n3 time. So throwing a total of 10 can appear 27 times in all. Therefore, the chance of throwing a total of 9 with three\nfair dice was less than that of throwing a total of 10.\n302 This would lead us to expect the following:\nPr(6 or 6 or 6 or 6 or 6 or 6 ) =\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nPr(6 ) + Pr(6 ) + Pr(6 )+ Pr(6 ) + Pr(6 ) + Pr (6 ) =\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1\nOn this line of reasoning, we are certain to get 6 in six throws of a die, and more than certain to\nget it in seven throws. Using the Disjunction Rule in this way commits the fallacy of treating the\nconstituent events as if they were mutually exclusive when they are not. Representing the\nproblem as Pr [(6 ) or (6 ) or (6 ) or (6 )] hides the fact that each of these alternatives could\n1 2 3 4\nbe true. They are not exclusive alternatives.\nThe problem is correctly represented by asking for the probability of not getting a 6 in either\nof the four throws. Using the Negation Rule Pr (A) + Pr (~A) = 1, it follows that\nPr (A) = 1 \u2013 Pr (~A) . Thus, the probability of getting a 6 in four throws is one minus the\nprobability of not getting a 6 on throw 1 or on throw 2 or on throw 3 or on throw 4:\nPr (6 in 4 throws) = 1 \u2013 Pr ~(6 in 4 throws) = 1 - Pr (~6 \u00b7 ~6 \u00b7 ~6 \u00b7 ~6 ).\n1 2 3 4\nSince (~6 ), (~6 ), (~6 ), and (~6 ) are independent events, using the Conjunction Rule we get:\n1 2 3 4\n1 - Pr (~6 \u00b7 ~6 \u00b7 ~6 \u00b7 ~6 ) = 1 \u2013 [Pr (~6 ) x Pr (~6 ) x Pr (~6 ) x Pr (~6 )] =\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\n1 \u2013 {5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6} = 1- 625/1296 = 1296/1296 \u2013 625/1296 = 671/1296\nIt follows that in betting even money on 6 in four throws, the Chevalier de Mere could, on the\naverage, expect to win 671 times and lose 625 times in a circuit of 64 (=1296) throws. The odds\nof throwing a 6 in four throws are 671: 625, slightly in favor of the Chevalier. But because this\noccurs only on the average over every 1296 throws, it is unlikely to be detected by the casual\nobserver. Yet, this slight advantage in the odds gave the Chevalier a respectable 7% profit on the\nwager.\n303 Cardano began his inquiries with the ethics of gambling in order to determine when a bet\nwas fair. In the modern theory of probability a fair bet is one in which the odds of winning are\nequal to the odds of losing. But the Chevalier was not looking to make a fair bet. He, like most\ngamblers, wanted a bet where the odds were in his favor, but not noticeably so. In such cases,\nmost losers tend to be unaware of the true source of their losses, and instead blame their bad luck\non a spiritual affliction of some sort. Many seek a remedy through charms and prayers, instead of\nthrough a rational appraisal of the odds. When the Chevalier lost money on a similar bet he\nsought an explanation from the mathematician Fermat.6 Fermat in turn involved the\nmathematician Blas\u00e9 Pascal, and together they introduced the basis for the modern theory of\nprobability.\n5.A.5. Exercises:\n1. Pr(6 in 2 throws) =\n2. Pr(6 in 3 throws) =\n3. Pr(6 in 5 throws) =\n4. Pr(6 in 6 throws) =\n5. What is the probability of getting heads each time in three throws of a coin?\n6. What is the probability of rolling two dice such that they sum three in each of three\nconsecutive throws?\n7. Out of 36 possible combinations of a pair of dice, only one, W6B6, gives a sum of 12. So\nwe would expect a pair of dice to sum twelve once in every thirty-six throws. The\nChevalier bet he could throw (6,6) in every twenty-four throws. Is this a good bet?\n8. What are the odds that 2 will show in three throws of a 6-sided die? [Cardano could\nexpect to win (on the average) 91 times and lose 125 times for every circuit of 216\nthrows.]\n6 One would expect that (6,6) would occur only once in every 36 throws of two dice.\n304 9. There are ten balls in a bag. 7 are Green and 3 are Blue. Jane is blindfolded, the bag is\nthoroughly shaken, and Jane draws a ball without looking. What is the probability that the\nball will be: B? G?\n10. Two dice are thrown. What are the odds that: (a) the tops of the two thrown dice sum 2;\nor (b) the tops of the two thrown dice sum 6.\n11. Jonita has flipped a fair coin three times, and each time it has come up heads. What are\nthe odds that the coin will come up heads on the next flip?\nRisk is a measure of the expected value of different options. It allows us to compare the\nharm or benefit that might result from different choices. Risk analysis helps make clear how\ncertain kinds of options are likely to be more beneficial than harmful. Let Pr(A) = probability of\nA and V(A) = value of A. Then the Expected Value, EV, of A is\nEV(A) = Pr(A) x V(A). 7\nSuppose, on a scale of 0 to 100, the value of a benign accident is V(A) = 0 while the value of a\nfatal accident is V(A) = 100. Then the value of a fatal accident using motorcycle V(Am) =\nvalue of fatal accident using auto V(Aa) = value of fatal accident using public transport V(Ap)\n= 100. But if the relative frequency of fatal accidents are Pr(Am) = 20/1000, Pr(Aa) = 10/1000,\nand Pr(Ap) = 5/1000, then\nEV(Am) = 2/100 x 100 = 2\nEV(Aa) = 1/100 x 100 = 1\nEV(Ap) = 1/200 x 100 = .5\nThis shows that, based on the relative frequencies given, the risk of a fatal accident using a\nmotorcycle is twice that using an auto and four times that using public transport.\n7 See Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk by Peter Bernstein, p.103. see also Risk and Rationality by\nK.S.Shrader-Frechette, chpt.10. Calculated Risks by J.Rodricks, chpt. 10.\n305 We take risks in order to obtain benefits we otherwise might not get. For the benefit of a\nregular salary, we accept the increased risk of an accident traveling to work. For the benefit of a\nwarm house in the winter, we risk our house catching fire. For the benefit of vegetables and\nfruits during the winter, we increase our risk of botulism poisoning. For the benefits of increased\nindustrialization, we increase our risks from exposure to chemical, biological, and mechanical\nhazards. We may buy insurance in order to guard against the exceptional losses that certain risks\nentail, but it is impossible to insure against all risks.\nWe also take risks to avoid certain harms we otherwise might suffer. We buy automobile\ninsurance in order to avoid losses from car accidents. But the possibility of being harmed is\nperceived and evaluated differently by different individuals. Some people are risk-aversive, and\nprefer to avoid losses rather than acquire benefits. Some people are risk-takers, and are prepared\nto suffer a loss in exchange for the opportunity to gain something they value. Some people are\ncalculative, and prefer to take only risks that give them the highest odds of winning. One person\nmight decline the opportunity for a great benefit in order to avoid the slightest risk to their\nfamily. Another might take great risks in order to provide benefit for their family. There is no\none way that all people value their experiences, assign probabilities, and take risks.\nThe mathematical theory of probability derives from games in which there are a finite\nnumber of clearly specifiable outcomes. Thus, the probability of drawing a spade from a regular\ndeck of playing cards is \u00bc, because there are 52 cards total, and 13 spades: 13/52 =1/4. But\nrelative frequencies are not as clear-cut as features of games. Determining the probability that a\nparticular house fire was accident or arson is in many cases a matter of contention. Likewise,\ndeciding whether (publicly provided) bikes will count as public transportation may be\ncontentious. And this will in turn affect the probabilities we assign.\n306 The features of real life are often not as well-defined as features of a game. There is not\nalways one right way to describe real life events that objectively determines their probability.\nThis makes it difficult to identify all the different outcomes there are, estimate the probability of\nthe different outcomes identified, and rank how important those outcomes are for the decision\nmaker. There may be no one right way of estimating a real-life event\u2019s probability. But for any\nparticular set of assumptions that we do make, the logic of probability provides us with a way to\nestimate the likelihood of the more complex events that derive from those assumptions. The\nmodern theory of probability provides us with a way of exploring the value of different\nassumptions so that we can avoid bad bets, losing investments, and faulty inferences.\n307 CHAPTER 6:\nINDUCTIVE LOGIC\nA. Inductive Inferences\nI. Inductive Generalizations\nWhen we use the information provided by a few instances of a certain kind to\ndraw conclusions about all instances of that kind, we are making a generalization. When\nwe use statistical information provided by a sample to draw statistical conclusions about\nthe population as a whole, we are making a statistical generalization. Thus, if I think that\nmost people won\u2019t like x because most of the people in my family don\u2019t like x, I am\nmaking a claim about most people, based on the sample of people in my family: \u201cI know\nmost people don\u2019t like hot spicy food because most of the people in my family don\u2019t like\nhot spicy food.\u201d This example illustrates two of the major sources of invalidity for\ninductive generalizations: (a) generalizing from samples that are too small; and (b)\ngeneralizing from samples that are biased.\n(a) Suppose there are twenty marbles in a bag. And, after shaking the bag and\ndrawing from it without looking, the first marble withdrawn is red. If I conclude that the\nrest of the marbles in the bag are red, then I am making a hasty generalization, based on\na sample that is too small.\nSuppose I continue to draw marbles without looking, and the second is red, the\nthird is red, and the fourth and fifth are red. The evidence provided by these five draws\nmakes the conclusion that all twenty of the marbles in the bag are red more probable.\n3083 08 Each random draw without looking increases the probability that all the marbles in the\nbag are red.\nSuppose further that five more marbles are drawn, and all are red, but the marbles\ndrawn were picked because they were red. This additional evidence would not increase\nthe probability that all the marbles in the bag are red as much as the first five choices\nbecause the additional evidence is chosen to support the claim that all the marbles are red,\nwhether that claim is true or false.\nFollowing are examples of fallacies resulting from samples that are too small:\n1. Three of my friends had lunch at the Princess Restaurant and said they liked it. It\nseems that everybody who goes there seems to like it.\n2. Mary met a very charming man who was French. Thereafter, she was convinced\nthat all Frenchmen were charming.\n3. I know that all twenty year olds like to dance because I have five twenty year old\nfriends and each one likes to dance.\n4. President Richard Nixon and Vice-president Spiro Agnew deceived the American\npeople, and that shows us that all Washington politicians are inherently deceitful.\n5. Bill Clinton and Elliot Spitzer were unfaithful while in public office. That shows\nus what you can expect of Democrats.\n6. John Mason is very aggressive. Maybe the rest of his family is like that too.\nOften, one particular case is presented as representative of all similar cases. And\nwith some kinds of things, one instance is like every other instance. Thus, the atomic\nweight of one gram of pure gold is going to be the same for every other gram of pure\ngold. And we expect one 16 oz. bottle of Coke to be like all other 16 oz. bottles of coke.\nWith such kinds of things, we can generalize from a single instance to all instances of the\n3083 09 same kind. A conclusion about the population as a whole can be drawn on the basis of a\nsmall sample when diversity within the population is small.\nBut, in diverse populations, what is true of one instance need not be true of all\ninstances of like kind. In such cases, when we generalize from a single instance or a small\nsample, we generalize hastily and should be prepared to revise our conclusions. Thus,\nsome Frenchmen may be charming, but some may also be rude. Some twenty year olds\nmay love to dance, but some may not. When there is a great deal of diversity within a\npopulation, a conclusion about the population as a whole cannot be drawn on the basis of\na small sample. In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of how much diversity\nthere is between the members of a population, and is used in determining the size a\nsample must have in order to make valid inferences about that population.\nInductive generalizations are also fallacious if they are inferred from samples that\nare biased, whether the bias is intentional or unintentional. Thus, the grocer who arranges\nbags of fruit with the unblemished fruit on the top and the blemished fruit on the bottom\nof the bag may be intentionally misleading the unwary customer. On the other hand,\nprosecutors may sincerely believe the sample of the evidence they have collected leads to\na clear conclusion. Consider the following example: (i) Mr. A's boss, Mr. B, has been\nfound murdered at his home, (ii) Mr. A was the last person seen leaving Mr. B's home on\nthe night of the murder, and (iii) Mr. A had been fired the day before and was quite upset\nover the loss of his job. Does this lead to the conclusion that Mr. A committed the\nmurder? Not necessarily. The information presented makes it probable that Mr. A\ncommitted the murder, and that is why investigators are justified in holding Mr. A\nsuspect. But there may be additional information that might decrease the probability that\n3083 10 Mr. A committed the murder. For instance, additional evidence might show that Mr. A\nwas miles from the scene at the time of the murder. The sample of evidence presented by\nthe prosecution need not be all of the relevant evidence. When evidence that supports a\nclaim is counted and evidence that denies it is discounted or ignored, the evidence is\ntreated in a biased manner.\nIn our personal lives, we are prone to use samples that are familiar and accessible\nin order to infer conclusions about the population the sample is taken to represent.\n(examples needed) Given the ever-present possibility of biased sampling (intentional and\nunintentional), procedures have been developed to insure that bias in the selection of the\nsample is minimized. This typically involves using a randomizing procedure for choosing\nthe sample that eliminates many common sources of bias (e.g., stirring the soup\nthoroughly before tasting it, calling a coin before flipping it; rolling the dice rather than\nsliding them; shuffling the deck before dealing a card, etc.).\nIn order to validly infer that what is true of the sample is true of the population as\na whole, the sample must be representative of the population as a whole, rather than\nrepresentative of one person\u2019s predilections and preferences. Since our choices can be\ninfluenced in subtle ways, we must be vigilant to ensure that the generalizations we\naccept are not based on evidence that is hasty, biased or both.\n3083 11 5.B.1. Exercises (more needed) on inductive generalizations:\n1. Ten dead bats were submitted to Wildlife Services. Five were rabid. Can we\ntherefore expect that 50% of all bats are rabid.\n2. Women talk more than men. I know this because my mother talks more than my\nfather.\n3. My neighbor solved my plumbing problem. He is probably good at solving math\nproblems as well.\n4. We prayed before the game, and we won. That proves that if a team wants to win\nthen that team has got to pray for it.\n5. The last two Sundays have been beautiful. We should expect every Sunday to be a\nbeautiful day.\n6. In a random sample of homeowners, 50% were against higher real estate taxes.\nTherefore, we can expect 50% of voters will oppose legislation for higher real\nestate taxes.\n7. This sample of gold has a boiling point of 267c. Therefore all gold has a boiling\npoint of 267c.\nII. Inductive Instantiation\nIn inductive instantiations, general information about a group is used to draw\nconclusions about an individual member of the group.\nExamples:\n1. Most boys like to play soccer. Jose is a boy. Therefore Jose probably likes to play\nsoccer.\n2. Most boys don\u2019t like to play with dolls. Jose is a boy. Therefore, Jose probably\ndoes not like to play with dolls.\n3. Most girls like to play with dolls. Maria is a girl. Therefore Maria probably likes\nto play with dolls.\n4. Most girls don\u2019t like to play violent video games. Maria is a girl. Therefore Maria\nprobably does not like to play violent video games.\n3083 12 These examples use widely held preconception about boys and girls in order to infer\ninformation about Jose and Maria. We tend to categorize individuals in terms of the\npreconceptions we have accepted without critical appraisal. Those preconceptions reflect\nthe kinds of things we believe exist and implies we can expect of such things. Typically\nthe preconceptions we use are not explicitly stated, and often a conclusion may be drawn\nabout a current situation on the basis of faulty generalizations.\nBecause the generalizations that are incorporated into our preconceptions are\ntypically not stated explicitly, the arguments they are used in take the form of\nenthymemes. Recall that an enthymeme is an incomplete argument where either a\npremise or the conclusion is unstated. Thus, the above examples might be phrased as\nenthymemes as follows:\n1. Jose is a boy. Therefore Jose probably likes to play soccer.\n2. Jose is a boy, so Jose probably doesn\u2019t like to play with dolls.\n3. Maria is a girl and we know what girls like to play with dolls, don\u2019t we.\n4. Maria is a girl, so she probably doesn\u2019t like to play violent video games.\nWhen an argument is given with a missing premise, the speaker is able to avoid\nopenly stating and asserting the missing generalization. Instead, the speaker leaves it up\nto the listener to supply the missing premise and its assumption of truth. When an\nargument is given with a missing conclusion, the speaker can avoid explicitly endorsing\nthe conclusion. Instead, it is left to the listener to infer the conclusion, which may be\nimplied but unstated.\nSometimes, it may be necessary to act on unexamined preconceptions. If Mary is\nwalking through the grass and sees a long slender figure lying ahead, she may become\n3083 13 frightened and wary of proceeding further. If the long slender figure remains straight and\nunchanging, she might re-evaluate her reaction that it might be a reptile. But if the figure\nappears to move, she would be confirmed in her belief that it might be a reptile. Mary\u2019s\ninitial preconception that the figure is a reptile would should be critically appraised on the\nbasis of relevant information.\nLikewise, if Mary has had no personal encounter with pit-bulls and only knows of\nthem through reputation, then she might hesitate to continue forward if she sees one\napproaching her. But suppose Mary is assured by all concerned that the pit-bull is old,\narthritic, and a pet for children in a nursery school. If she continues to act as if this pit-\nbull is likely to violently assault her, then she has a preconception of a pit-bull that is\nresistant to further information.\nA stereotype is a preconception that is resistant to modification on the basis of\nrelevant information. If Mary is afraid of pit bulls, her preconception that pit bulls are\nviolent may benefit her by making her cautious around them. But if she ignores\nadditional information showing that a particular pit-bull is highly unlikely to be violent,\nthen her concept of a pit-bull is fixed and rigid. If all one knows is that Jose is a boy, it\nmight be reasonable to assume that he probably likes to play soccer, because many boys\ndo like to play soccer. But if we learn subsequently that Jose has been paraplegic from\nbirth, it may be unreasonable to claim that Jose would still probably like to play soccer.\nMany stereotypes have evolved as historical tools of oppression, when individuals\nwere forced to conform to society\u2019s prior preconceptions about them. Women and people\nof color were considered to be naturally subservient, and this subservience was coerced\nunder threat of violence. Though a person may have little choice about which\n3083 14 preconceptions they have inherited from the past, they do have a moral obligation to\nexamine those preconceptions in the face of contrary evidence. Many preconceptions\nescape attention because they remain unstated. Articulating and critically examining\npreconceptions is the best antidote to stereotyped behavior. Being rational requires being\nopen to new information that may lead us to alter our preconceptions, no matter how we\nmay have acquired them.\n5.B.3. Exercises (editing needed) on inductive syllogisms:\nFor each of the following, complete the enthymeme by identifying the\ngeneralization that is unstated. Provide (a) additional information that increases and\n(b) additional information that decreases the probability that the generalization is\napplicable:\n1. John is Jewish. So John probably likes money.\n2. Ben Carson is a successful African-American neuro-surgeon. He is also\nprobably a good athlete.\n3. Alice Walker is a successful African-American writer. But we can be certain that\nAlice probably still loves fried chicken.\n4. Hector is an 88 yr. old Afro-Cuban male. But Hector probably still loves to dance.\n5. Jamaal is African-American and Phillip is European-American. So Phillip\nprobably has a higher IQ than Jamaal.\n6. Mr. and Mrs. Gonzalez own a highly successful business. But I\u2019ll bet that Mr. and\nMrs. Gonzalez still have a large family.\n7. Jim is Native American. So he probably receives income from casino gambling.\n8. Mary Wong is Japanese. So she is probably docile and submissive to her husband.\n9. Cornel West is a contemporary African American philosopher. So it is likely that\nhe has a criminal past.\n10. Mary has been unmarried all her life. That is probably why Mary is unhappy.\n3083 15 11. Phyllis is majoring in physics. But it is likely that Phyllis will give up when the\nmath becomes really difficult.\n12. I have encouraged my daughter to follow her natural inclinations and be a\nwonderful mother for children she can be proud of.\n13. Mary is probably weaker than Mike because that\u2019s how women and men usually\nare.\n14. My wife is more emotional than me because that\u2019s how men and women usually\nare.\n15. Toni is HIV positive. (S)He is probably homosexual.\n16. Toni is homosexual, so (s)he is probably HIV positive.\n17. Jim is Irish, so he probably loves to drink and fight.\n18. K is driving a Mercedes so K must be wealthy.\n19. B graduated from Smith College, so B is probably a feminist.\n20. D is a computer scientist, so D is probably horrible at sports.\n21. Z is a doctor, so Z must know CPR.\n22. I saw K buying a cake. So K must love sweets.\n23. My German Shepard was very easy to train, so I\u2019m sure your German Shepard\nwill be housebroken in no time.\n3083 16 III. Analogical Inference\nSome inductive arguments involve reasoning by analogy, where the properties of\none instance are used to infer what properties a similar instance will have. Reasoning by\nanalogy proceeds from one instance, X, to another instance, Y (without necessarily\ngeneralizing) and has the following form:\nPrimary analogue: X has properties a, b, c, d, e;\nSecondary analogue: Y has properties a, b, c, d;\nTherefore, probably Y has property e.\nExamples:\n1. At time t I ate mushrooms and I got sick. Therefore, if I eat mushrooms at time\n1\nt , then I will probably get sick.\n2\n2. When X pet dog , it bit X. Therefore, if Y pets dog , the dog will probably bite Y.\n1 1\n3. X purchased a Yotota and was very pleased with its performance. Therefore if Y\npurchases a Yotota, then Y will probably be pleased with its performance.\n4. When water was poured on a campfire, the fire went out. Therefore, if we pour\nwater on this grease fire, the fire will go out.\n5. X appears, and has on white shoes, a white suit, and a white tie. Y appears, and\nhas on white shoes and a white suit. His back is to us, however, and we can\u2019t see\nthe color of his tie. But it will probably be white.\nThings, persons, and groups are often described in analogical terms as a way of\nundermining or inflating their value. Thus, if B is described as strong as an ox, we might\neasily conclude that B is also probably as dumb as an ox. But if B is described as strong\nas a lion, we are more likely to conclude that B is probably as brave as a lion, as well.\nWhen the aim is to oppress a group, that group is often characterized as analogous to\n3083 17 non-human animals we detest. But when the aim is to valorize a group, they are described\nas analogues of animals we admire.\n1. The T are like the cockroaches in our homes. We would kill the cockroaches. We\nshould kill the T.\n2. The Js in our country are like rats in our neighborhoods. We exterminate rats. We\nshould exterminate the Js.\n3. B people are like dangerous animals. We need to keep them locked up for our\nprotection.\nIn reasoning by analogy, we infer that Y has property e because Y shares\nproperties a, b, c, and d with X, and X has property e. An analogy is strong if the\npresence of a,b,c, and d makes the presence of e more probable. But an analogy is weak\nif the presence of a,b,c, and d does not make the presence of e more probable. Thus,\nknowing the manufacturer of a car is relevant to inferences about whether the car will\nperform well. But knowing the color of a car neither increases nor decreases the\nprobability that the car will perform well. We base our expectations on a weak analogy if\nwe expect the color and trim of Y\u2019s car to be relevant to the performance of Y\u2019s car.\nAnd though the logo of a car may have no causal relationship to the mechanical functions\nof the car, companies go to great lengths to insure that their logo is a reliable indicator of\nthe mechanical quality of the car.\nX is in a red and white bottle and X tastes great. Y is in a similar red and white bottle.\nTherefore, Y will taste great as well.\nOn the other hand, relevant dissimilarities between X and Y decrease the\nprobability that what is true of X will also be true of Y. In such cases, though there are\nsimilarities between X and Y, there are also relevant dis-similarities between X and Y\nthat make the analogical inference faulty.\n3083 18 1. If J was tired at time t when she ate mushrooms and got sick and J is not tired at\n1\ntime t when she eats mushrooms, then the probability that she will get sick at\n2\ntime t may be less than it was at time t .\n2 1\n2. If dog was eating when X pet it at time t , and dog is not eating when X pets it at\n1 1 1\ntime t , then the probability that the dog will bite X at time t may be less than it\n2 2\nwas at time t .\n1\n3. If X purchased a Yotota sedan and Y purchases a Yotota truck, what holds true\nfor the sedans may not hold true for the trucks.\n4. Mary is a human and Mary can become pregnant. Tom is a human. Therefore\nTom can become pregnant.\nIn law, the primary analogue X is called the precedent. In legal litigation, one\nparty attempts to show that a current case, Y, is similar in all relevant respects to a\nprecedent, X, and should be decided as the precedent was decided. The other party\nattempts to show that Y is not similar in all relevant respects to X, and should be decided\nin a manner contrary to the decision in X. Similar cases should receive similar treatment\nunder the law, but dissimilar cases may require different treatments. Many legal\ncontroversies hinge on how the primary analogue is framed.\nExamples:\n1. A fetus is similar in all important respects to a child. Therefore, abortion is like\nkilling an innocent child and is a form of murder.\n2. A fetus is growing tissue that is not yet a child. Therefore abortion is not like\nmurder.\n3. A mother who takes drugs while pregnant is guilty of child-abuse.\n4. A mother who takes drugs while pregnant is guilty of self-abuse.\nThere are correct and incorrect uses of the argument from analogy.\n3083 19 Strong Analogies:\n1. Housecats are felines and have whiskers. Lions are felines. Therefore, lions\nprobably have whiskers.\n2. A home is like a castle. A castle is a place where you should feel secure. So, a\nhome is a place where you should feel secure.\nWeak Analogies:\n1. Housecats are felines and need protection from large vicious dogs. Lions are\nfelines. Therefore, lions need protection from large vicious dogs.\n2. A home is like your castle. A castle has guards and a moat. Therefore, I should\nbuild a moat around my house and hire guards for protection.\n3. Water is a liquid and pouring water on the fire extinguished it. Oil is a liquid. So,\npouring oil on the fire will probably extinguish it.\n4. Men in power have often coerced sexual favors from women subordinates.\nWomen will probably do the same thing to men subordinates when they gain\npower.\n5.C.1. Exercises (more needed):\nA. For each of the following, determine if the analogy is weak or strong:\n1. Human beings and watches are similar in that they are all finely structured.\nWatches do not evolve from random combinations of glass and steel, and by analogy,\n(cid:1) human beings do not evolve from the random combination of cells and tissues.\n2. Electrons revolve around the nucleus just like planets revolve around the sun. By\nanalogy, electrons must be attracted to the nucleus because of gravity.\n3. Mars and Earth both orbit around the sun, and they both have satellites. Since life\nexists on earth, it is reasonable to predict that life exists on Mars as well.\n3083 20 B. In the following Arguments from Analogy, introduce factors that increase\nand factors that decrease the probability that the conclusion is true:\n1. Tar smeared on the exposed skin of mice caused an 80% increase in the incidence\nof skin cancer in the group. Therefore, tar smeared on the lining of the lungs of\nhuman beings will cause an increase in the incidence of lung cancer.\n2. My last pair of Hike running shoes made my feet feel extra good. That\u2019s how I\nknow that my new pair will give me great satisfaction.\n3. You let my older sister stay out till midnight when she became 16. Now I am 16,\nso you should let me stay out till midnight.\n4. Fathers should set the rules for their family in the same way that God set the rules\nfor the universe. Wives should obey their husbands as nature obeys God\u2019s laws.\n5. Chimps have learned to use sign language. Therefore, birds will probably be able\nto learn sign language.\n6. If a person spends more than they make, they will face financial ruin. And if our\ncountry spends more than it receives in taxes, then it will face financial ruin.\nC. In each of the following, identify the primary and secondary analogue, and\ndiscuss their similarities and dissimilarities.\n1. Most men are like spoiled children. They must have cars and tools the way a child\nhas toys and games.\n2. The earth is like a lifeboat afloat on the sea. That is why we must conserve our\nresources.\n3. I felt horrible when I had the flu so I know how you must feel.\nD. For each of the following, underline the term that best completes the\nanalogy:\n1. Woman/man = day/? (week, hour year, night, darkness)\n2. Bachelor/unmarried man = father/? (mother, child, male parent, uncle)\n3083 21 C. Causal Inference\nNecessary and Sufficient Conditions\nSome inductive arguments involve inferring that two events, C and E, have a\ncause-effect relationship. What we identify as the cause, C, of E must precede E and is\ninfluenced by the kinds of interests we have in E events. If we are interested in\nproducing E events, then we look for sufficient conditions, CS, such that CS \u00c9 E. If we\nare interested in preventing E events, then we look for necessary conditions, CN, such\nthat ~CN \u00c9 ~E.\nSuppose we are interested in sufficient conditions for accidental housefires.\nThere are many ways that housefires can be produced: cigarettes, cooking, heating,\nelectric short-circuits, gas leaks, lightning, etc. In each case, a particular cause may\nprobably be sufficient to produce a housefire. Thus, a lit cigarette that falls onto dry\npaper will probably produce a flame, but not necessarily. And the flame it produces may\ncause the house to catch fire, but not necessarily.\nWhen we say that CS is sufficient to cause E, we really mean that CS makes E\nhighly probable given the circumstances. Thus, if an electrical short-circuit burns the\ninsulation from around the wires, it becomes more probable (but not necessary) that a fire\nwill result. Likewise, if a house is struck by lightning or develops a gas leak, the\nprobability of a housefire increases significantly. Each of these might probably be\nsufficient to produce a housefire under ordinary circumstances.\n3083 22 If we are interested in preventing E events, then we look for necessary\nconditions, CN, for E such that ~CN \u00c9 ~E. Thus, lack of intention to start a fire is a\nnecessary condition for an accidental fire. Likewise oxygen is a necessary condition for\nfires, because if there is no oxygen present then there will be no fires. But we cannot\nremove all oxygen from the atmosphere to prevent housefires. And even if we could we\nshould not, since oxygen is necessary for our metabolic processes as well.\nWhile we cannot eliminate the conditions necessary for all fires, we can reduce\nthe probability that a housefire will occur by eliminating the conditions necessary for the\nmajor types of housefire. Thus, by eliminating the smoking of cigarettes in a house (No\nsmoking allowed!), eliminating electrical short-circuits and gas leaks from the house\n(through regular inspection and maintenance), by eliminating the presence of\ncombustionable materials in the house (No storage of gasoline allowed!), we reduce the\nprobability of housefires. But we do not eliminate all possibility of housefires.\nMill\u2019s Methods 1\nMill\u2019s Methods of Agreement and Difference have been widely used in identifying\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. In the Method of Agreement, we look at all cases in\nwhich an event of type E occurs, and we identify those conditions that are present with\neach of the occurrences of E. These conditions are possible sufficient causes of E:\nwhenever events of type E have occurred, conditions of type CS have been present.\nSometimes a factor, B, is co-present with CS when E is produced, but B is nonetheless\nnot causally related to E. In such cases, we would have a correlation between B and E,\nbut B would not be a cause of E. To illustrate, increased ice cream sales accompany\n1 Mill, John S. A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive. New York: Harper & Bros, 1858. Print.\n3083 23 increased deaths from swimming, but increased ice cream sales do not cause increases in\nswimming deaths.\nMill\u2019s Method of Difference is used to identify those conditions, CN, such that,\nwhen they are not present, an event of type E does not occur. The Method of Difference\nwill identify all conditions that could be necessary for E. CN is a necessary condition for\nE means ~CN \u00c9 ~E. When events of type CN are prevented, events of type E are\nprevented. Thus, the presence of oxygen is a necessary condition for fires because\neliminating the presence of oxygen eliminates the possibility of fires. And eliminating\nrags and paint thinner reduces the probability of fire from spontaneous combustion.\nMany detective stories analyze and solve crimes using the methods of agreement\nand difference. Suppose Jones has been somewhere nearby each time cars have been\nsprayed with yellow paint on Elm Street. And suppose further that such incidents have\nnot taken place where Jones was not present. Then we have good reason to consider\nJones to be necessary and sufficient for the spray painting crimes in question.\nFinally, Mill\u2019s method of Concomitant Variation involves varying a condition C\nto see if it brings about variations in the occurrences of E. This notion of causation has\nbeen widely used in dealing with events where neither necessary nor sufficient conditions\ncan be readily identified. Thus, smoking is considered a major cause of lung cancer,\nthough smoking is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for lung cancer. Some\npeople who smoke do not get lung cancer. And some who get lung cancer have never\nsmoked. But populations with lower rates of smoking have lower rates of cancer, and\npopulations with higher rates of smoking have higher rates of cancer. It is because\nvariations in rates of smoking bring about concomitant variations in rates of lung cancer\n3083 24 that we are justified in saying that smoking causes cancer.2 The causal relation between\nsmoking and lung cancer allows us to predict that lung cancer rates will rise if smoking\nrates increase, and lung cancer rates will decrease if there is a decrease in the incidence of\nsmoking. And we can know this even though we may not know exactly how smoking is\ncausally connected to lung cancer in individual cases.\n5.D.1. Exercises on Necessary and Sufficient conditions:\nFor each of the following, determine whether a necessary or a sufficient cause is implied:\n1. x failed the test because he was too tired to concentrate.\n2. y will graduate with honors because he had straight A\u2019s in every class.\n3. x loves too dance because she\u2019s a teenager.\n4. y will not go to college because he did not apply.\n5. The fire was arson because it was intentionally started.\n6. The fire was accidental because it originated from spontaneous combustion of\noily rags.\n7. x confessed because he was tortured.\n8. y caught the flu because his roommate infected him.\n2 Likewise smoking is considered a major cause of housefires, even though smoking is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of housefires. Some people smoke in\ntheir homes but never have housefires. And some people have housefires who do not\nsmoke. Nonetheless, the frequency of housefires is less among those who do not smoke\nand greater among those who do smoke. See Hill.\n3083 25 9. The flowers did not grow because they were not watered (did not get enough\nsunshine).\n10. The snow is melting because it is getting warmer outside.\n11. Saccharine causes tumors in lab rats.\n12. The A rats have tumors and the B rats do not because A rats were fed saccharine\nand the B rats were not.\n13. The assassination of MLK caused the black community to erupt in violence.\n14. Slavery and Jim Crow are the major causes of black poverty.\n15. Lack of competition is the major cause of higher prices.\n16. Global warming is being caused by industrial development.\n17. Sea levels are rising because of global warming.\n18. Smoking causes cancer.\n19. x has cancer because x was a heavy smoker all her life.\n20. The water will not boil because it has antifreeze in it.\n21. x is no longer lonely because she now has a close friend.\n22. The window broke because it was hit by a stone.\n23. X\u2019s tires went flat because y slashed them\n3083 26 24. The gun fired because x removed the safety lock and pulled the trigger.\n25. Y was shot because x aimed the gun at Y and pulled the trigger.\n26. The fire was extinguished because we poured water on it.\n27. The fire was started because the children were playing with matches.\n28. Eating undercooked chicken ill cause you to be sick.\n29. The lights came on because I flipped the switch.\n30. Poor kids show poor academic aptitudes because life is not academic for them\n(they must devote their time to surviving rather than to reading).\n31. The sea level is rising because the icebergs are melting.\n32. Crime increases when unemployment increases.\n33. Homosexuality will increase because same-sex marriage has become acceptable.\n34. Cloning is possible because of in vitro fertilization.\n35. Allergies are increasing because of increases in the use of antibiotics.\n36. Stainless steel is resistant to rust because the iron it is made from has been treated\nwith alloys.\n3083 27 Causal Inference in Science and Medicine\nA central feature of modern science is use of the Experimental Method to\nidentify the cause C of an effect E. While our discussion has proceeded as if a causal\nrelation is a two place predicate connecting two variables, C and E, experiments make it\nclear that causal relations are three-place predicates: \u201cC is the cause of E\u201d is short for \u201cC\nis the cause of E in conditions Z\u201d. In a controlled experiment, the control situation Z\n1\nand the experimental situation Z are analogues, and CS is introduced into Z but not into\n2 2\nZ . If E occurs in Z but does not occur in Z , then we have good reason to believe that, in\n1 2 1\nsituations like Z and Z , CS is sufficient to produce E. On the other hand, if CN is\n1 2\nfollowed by E in Z but E ceases to occur when CN is removed, then CN is necessary for\n2\nE in Z situations.\nModern medicine begins with the Germ Theory of Disease, when microbes were\nfirst identified as necessary and sufficient causes of disease. It is based on the work of\nRobert Koch, who first identified the microbial agent that causes cholera. Koch\u2019s\nmethod of identifying a cause is referred to as Koch\u2019s Postulates: In order for an agent,\nC, to be identified as the cause of malady E, C had to be: a. extracted from a host Z who\n1\nis suffering from E; b. cultivated in vitro; c. then re-introduced into a healthy host Z .\n2\nd. If the malady subsequently manifests in the new host Z , this demonstrates that C is\n2\nsufficient to cause E in hosts like Z. On the other hand, if a host Z is suffering from E,\nand removing C removes E, this shows that C is necessary for E in hosts like Z.3\n3 Koch, Robert. Investigations into the Etiology of Traumatic Infective Diseases. The\nNew Sydenham Society, 1880.\n3083 28 Sometimes it is not possible to carry out an experiment where an element, C, is\ndeliberately introduced or withdrawn from a situation Z in order to see how E is affected.\nBut if it is possible to identify naturally occurring situations which are similar except for\nthe presence or absence of the suspected cause C, we can then observe how this affects\nthe presence or absence of E. Such non-experimental observations are the basis of\nresearch in epidemiology.\nSomething like this occurred prior to Koch\u2019s discovery of the cholera bacillus.\nJohn Snow noted that cholera occurred at a much higher rate in an area that received\nsewage contaminated drinking water than in an area that received uncontaminated water.\nHe conjectured that reducing the level of human sewage in drinking water would reduce\nthe rate of cholera. And where human sewage was reduced, cholera rates diminished.\nBut this was before Koch identified the cholera virus. Snow showed how sources and\nremedies for a malady may be identified even when the specific cause of the malady is\nunknown.\nIn scientific studies, patients often show improvement simply because they\nbelieve they have been treated with something that will help them. But in many cases it is\ntheir belief that they will get better from the treatment, rather than the specific treatment\nitself, that causes them to feel better. Likewise, people often feel worse if they believe\nsomeone else has done something to make them feel worse. It is the belief in the potency\nof a curse, rather than the potency of the curse itself, that makes them feel worse. This is\ncalled the Placebo effect.\nA similar situation is produced when experimenters (often unintentionally)\ninteract with their experimental subjects differently from how they interact with their\n3083 29 control subjects. And it is the difference in interactions rather than the difference in\ntreatments that causes differences in outcomes between the experimental and the control\ngroup. This is called the Experimenter Effect. Double blind experiments are used to\neliminate sources of bias generated by the expectations of both the experimental subject\nand the experimenter. In a double-blind experiment, neither the experimenter nor the\nexperimental subject knows whether the subject is receiving a genuine treatment or a fake\ntreatment.\nCommon Causal Fallacies\nPost hoc, ergo propter hoc: If B follows A, then B was caused by A.\nOne of the basic rules of causation is that a cause must precede its effect. Thus,\nwhen two things occur together in sequence, we tend to believe that the earlier event is\nthe cause of the subsequent event. This is why, when the magician taps his magic cane\nand a rabbit appears, we are inclined to believe that tapping the cane caused the rabbit to\nappear. However, the fact that two events occur in sequence does not mean that the\nearlier event is the cause of the later event. This expectation is the source of many\nfallacies in causal attribution.\nExamples:\n1. Every time we have won we have prayed before the game. That is how we know\nthat prayer is the primary cause of our success.\n2. A black cat crossed my path. That is probably why I had an accident later on.\n3. I took xyz cold medicine and two days later my cold was gone. Therefore xyz\ncold medicine caused my recovery from the cold.\n3083 30 Correlation is not causation:\nJust because two events vary together doesn\u2019t mean that one is the cause of the other.\nOften, the variation in both the two events may be the effect of another factor altogether.\nExamples:\n1. As ice cream sales increase, drowning deaths increase. And as ice cream sales\ndecrease, drowning deaths decrease. Therefore more ice cream eating is causing\nmore drowning deaths.\n2. Night is always followed by day. Therefore the passing of the night brings about\nthe coming of a new day.\nConfusing cause with effect\n1. The crowing of the rooster causes the sun to rise. (Or does the rising of the sun\ncause the rooster to crow?)\n2. Low IQ causes impoverishment. (Or does impoverishment cause low IQ?)\n3. The child\u2019s misbehavior causes the parents to be short-tempered. (Or does the\nparents\u2019 short temper cause the child to misbehave?)\nFallacies of Variation\n1. Rain is necessary for corn to grow. Therefore, the more it rains, the more the corn\nwill grow.\n2. A good education is necessary for a good job. Therefore, the more education you\nget, the better job you will get.\nConfirmation Bias\nIf C1, C2, and C3 are possible sufficient causes of E, focusing initial attention on C1\nincreases the likelihood that C1 will be accepted as the cause of E, even if additional\nevidence makes C2 or C3 the more likely cause. Confirmation bias makes it likely that\npeople will look for evidence that confirms their assumptions rather than for evidence\n3083 31 that challenges those assumptions. But preconceptions that are maintained in the face of\ncontrary evidence are fixed and likely to mislead.\nCausation in the Social Sciences\nCurrently, a famous set of experiments in the social sciences has been used to\ndemonstrate the existence what is called \u201cstereotype threat\u201d. Prof. Claude Steele has\nprovided evidence to show that fear of confirming a demeaning stereotype negatively\naffects performance. There is much anecdotal evidence (from coaches, parents,\ncounselors) that what a person believes about their capabilities affects their performance.\nSteele provides experimental evidence, generated under controlled conditions, showing\nhow preexisting beliefs can produce performances that reinforce those beliefs. Steele\u2019s\ninnovation is in creating experimental, and not just anecdotal, evidence for the existence\nof effects produced by preexisting stereotypes. This evidence is meant to be replicable by\nothers under similar conditions.\nSteele proceeds in classic scientific manner. A group of subjects, Z, is chosen and\n(randomly) divided into two groups, Z1 and Z2. C is introduced into Z2, the\nexperimental group and C is not introduced into Z1, the control group. If E is produced in\nZ2 but not in Z1, then we are justified in considering C to be the cause of E in groups like\nZ1 and Z2. Using this model, Steele was able to demonstrate the effect of stereotype\nthreat on many different groups.\nThus, suppose two groups of black students, B1 and B2, are chosen who are alike\nin all relevant features, and B1\u2019s are told they will take an IQ test while B2s are told that\nit is a vocabulary test under development. Steele showed that B2\u2019s consistently\nperformed worse than B1s, and he attributed this to B2\u2019s apprehension that they would\n3083 32 confirm the stereotype of black people having low IQs. Likewise, two groups of female\nstudents, F1 and F2, were chosen who were alike in all relevant features, and F2s were\ntold they would take a test of their potential for athletics and F1s were told that it was a\ntest of their vocabularies. Again F2s consistently performed worse than F1s, because of\nthe threat of confirming the stereotype that women have low athletic ability.\nIn another recent study (4/24/2104) student athletes were divided into two groups, A1s\nand A2s. Before the test, students in A2 were asked about their sports activities on\ncampus while students in group A1 were asked about the dining services. Students in\ngroup A2 who were reminded of their status as athletes consistently performed worse on\nthe test (confirming the \u201cdumb-jock\u201d stereotype) than similar students who were not\nreminded of their status as athletes.\nThe effect of stereotype threat on performance has become a model of how\nunexamined preconceptions can contribute to behavior that supports those very\npreconceptions. Being rational requires resisting the tendency to (i) favor evidence that\nconfirms a preexisting assumption and (ii) ignore evidence that tends to disconfirm that\nassumption.\n5.D.2. Exercises needed on (a) experiments in the natural and social sciences; (b)\ncommon causal fallacies.\n3083 33 CHAPTER 7\nINFORMAL FALLACIES\nA deductive fallacy is committed whenever it is suggested that the truth of the conclusion\nof an argument necessarily follows from the truth of the premises given, when in fact that\nconclusion does not necessarily follow from those premises. An inductive fallacy is\ncommitted whenever it is suggested that the truth of the conclusion of an argument is\nmade more probable by its relationship with the premises of the argument, when in fact it\nis not. We will cover two kinds of fallacies: formal fallacies and informal fallacies. An\nargument commits a formal fallacy if it has an invalid argument form. An argument\ncommits an informal fallacy when it has a valid argument form but derives from\nunacceptable premises.\nA. Fallacies with Invalid Argument Forms\nConsider the following arguments:\n(1) All Europeans are racist because most Europeans believe that Africans are\ninferior to Europeans and all people who believe that Africans are inferior\nto Europeans are racist.\n(2) Since no dogs are cats and no cats are rats, it follows that no dogs\nare rats.\n(3) If today is Thursday, then I'm a monkey's uncle. But, today is not\nThursday. Therefore, I'm not a monkey's uncle.\n(4) Some rich people are not elitist because some elitists are not rich.\n334 These arguments have the following argument forms:\n(1) Some X are Y\nAll Y are Z\nAll X are Z.\n(2) No X are Y\nNo Y are Z\nNo X are Z\n(3) If P then Q\nnot-P\nnot-Q\n(4) Some E are not R\nSome R are not E\nEach of these argument forms is deductively invalid, and any actual argument with such a\nform would be fallacious. There are many other forms that an argument might have that\nwould make it invalid (and thereby fallacious), and it was the purpose of Chapters 1, 2, 3,\nand 4 to provide us with procedures for describing and testing the formal validity of\nargument forms.\nOne common kind of formal fallacy derives from the use of ambiguous terms. In Chapter\n3, we explored how such fallacies derived from a faulty middle term in a syllogism. Thus,\n\u201cEvery lion is ferocious and Haile Sellassie was the Lion of Judah so Haile Sellassie must\nhave been ferocious\u201d has the syllogistic form:\nAll L are F (major premise)\nAll HS are L\u2019 (minor premise)\nAll HS are F (conclusion)\n335 The fallacy involves treating L as if it were the same as L', thus suggesting that the\nargument has the valid form:\nAll Y are Z\nAll X are Y\nAll X are Z\nWhenever an ambiguous word or phrase or sentence is used in more than one sense to\ndraw a particular conclusion, we have a fallacy resulting from ambiguity. This pattern is\nexhibited in the fallacies of Equivocation, Amphiboly, and Accent.\nI. The Fallacy of Equivocation\nA term (i.e., word or phrase) is equivocal if it has different meanings in different\ncontexts. The fallacy of equivocation arises when alternate meanings of the term are used\nto gain acceptance of the premises and draw the conclusion offered.\nExamples:\n(1) The rich farmer told the pretty young woman that he would give her\neverything he had in his banks if she would marry him. She agreed,\nand after the wedding she did everything to please. Finally, she\nwanted to know how much was hers, as had been promised. The\nfarmer took her to the river that ran through the middle of his great\nfarm and told her, \u201cEverything you see in those banks is yours. I\nsuppose it's about 20,000 gallons of water a day, all yours.\u201d\n(2) No government that is divided can stand. But the U.S. Government is\ndivided into legislative, judicial, and executive branches. So, the\nU. S. Government cannot stand.\n(3) Every kid needs to learn to read and write. Baby goats are kids.\nTherefore, baby goats need to learn to read and write.\n336 The first example involves an equivocation on the word \u201cbank\u201d and its meaning as: (a) a\nfinancial institution for storing and preserving money and valuables, and (b) as the sides\nof a stream, river, lake, sea or other substantial body of water. Example (2) involves\nequivocation on the phrase \u201cgovernment that is divided.\u201d The phrase is used initially to\nsuggest the meaning \u201cGovernment that is divided between warring factions\u201d but\nafterwards, it is used to mean \u201cgovernment that is divided into branches with different\nfunctions.\u201d The final example involves an equivocation on the term \u201ckid,\u201d which is used\ninitially to mean \u201ca young human being\u201d, but subsequently is used to mean \"a young\ngoat.\u201d\n6. A. 1. Exercise:\nExplain how the terms pitcher, bat, bank, spoke, fish, dig, square, bad, could be\nambiguous. Try to formulate arguments in which these terms are used ambiguously.\nA common way of describing groups is in terms of group averages. But different\nconcepts of averages can be used equivocally to lead to a particular conclusion that in\nfact does not follow. Thus, suppose firm A has 10 employees where 9 make $10,000 p/y\nand the president makes $110,000 p/y. The total salary is $2,00,000 for the 10 employees,\ngives an average salary of $20,000 per employee. The president of a firm can truthfully\nsay that the average salary is $20,000 p/y. The average being used by the president is\nthe mean, which is the total amount paid in salaries divided by the total number of\nworkers. But the mean tells us nothing about how salaries are distributed in firm A. On\nthe other hand, the union will stress that the average salary is 1/11 the salary of the\npresident.\nSuppose that firm B has 10 employees, each making $20,000 p/y. B also has a\nmean salary of $20,00 p/y. but the mean in firm B is much more indicative of what the\n337 \u2018average\u2019 worker actually earns. The mean, mode and median are different ways of\ntalking about group averages. The mean salary is the total paid in salaries divided by the\nnumber of individuals paid. The modal salary is the salary that most employees make.\nThe modal salary for A is $10,000 p/y. The modal salary for firm B is $20,000, twice the\nmodal salary in A. Yet each has the same average in terms of the mean.\nAnother way of characterizing a group is in terms of percentages.\nEquivocation in using percentages occurs when a percentage calculated on one base is\nused as if it applied equally to a different base. Consider the following examples:\nClaim:\nA survey showed that people who use Pepodent have 20% fewer cavities. Therefore, if\nyou use Pepodent you will probably have 20% fewer cavities than if you didn\u2019t use\nPepodent.\nAnalysis:\nIt may be true that Pepodent users have 20% fewer cavities on average than non-\nPepodent users. But this does not imply that using Pepodent will cause each user to have\n20% fewer cavities.\nClaim:\nPeople who go to college make 50% more income. Therefore, if you go to college you\u2019ll\nmake 50% more income than if you didn\u2019t go to college.\nAnalysis:\nThe class of people who go to college may make 50% more income. But going to college\nmay not lead each graduate to make 50% more than if they had not gone to college.\nClaim:\nSuppose a merchant spends $9 on merchandise each day that she then sells for $10. Her\ntotal sales for the year are $3650. With a profit of $365, this gives her a return (on total\nsales) of 10%. But with an initial investment of $9 and a final profit of $365, the\npercentage return (on initial investment) is 500%. The company made 10% return on total\nsales but a 500% return on initial investment.\nAnalysis:\nThe above fallacies involve calculating a percentage on one base, then then applying it to\na different base.\n338 6. A. 2. Exercise: Analyze each of the following claims:\nClaim:\n20% off of list price. A week later, take an additional 30% off. Therefore, customers are\nreceiving a 50% discount. (But in fact, they only have 44% discount.)\nClaim:\n10% of As are Bs. 10% of Bs are Cs. Therefore, 10% of As are Cs.\nClaim:\nA makes $10,000 a year and her salary is reduced by 20% to $8,000. A year later her\nsalary is increased by 20%. Therefore, A makes the same as she originally did.\nII. Fallacy of Amphiboly\nA sentence that has two distinct meanings because of as the way it is constructed is\ncalled an amphibolous sentence. The fallacy of amphiboly occurs when one meaning of\nan amphibolous sentence is used to gain acceptance of a premise and an alternative\nmeaning is applied to the conclusion drawn.\nExamples:\n(1) General Hush said the terrorists must be stopped before rising from his desk. Any\nperson who sincerely believes that people are waiting to arise from inside his desk is\nmentally ill. Therefore, General Hush is mentally ill.\n(2) Mr. A. Don't you agree that all men are not sexist?\nMs. B. Yes.\nMr. A Then, you must be mistaken in describing me as sexist,\ndespite my natural superioriority to women. For what is true of all men must\ncertainly be true of me.\n(3) The editor said she would lose no time in reading my manuscript.\nTherefore, she will probably have read it before this week is over.\n339 In the first example, the statement \u201cHush said the terrorists must be stopped before rising\nfrom his desk\u201d is ambiguous between: (a) a situation in which Hush said \u201cThe terrorists\nmust be stopped\u201d before he arose from his desk; and (b) a situation in which Hush said\nthat the terrorists must be stopped before they arose from his desk. Without a doubt, (b)\ndepicts a rather bizarre state of affairs while (a) is perfectly ordinary. In the second\nexample, the proposition \u201cAll men are not sexist\u201d is ambiguous between \u201cSome men are\nnot sexist\u201d and \u201cNo men are sexist.\u201d The conclusion of the argument makes use of the\nsecond meaning though it is probably the first meaning that leads Ms. B to accept the\nambiguous statement as a premise. In the third example, the locution \u201cX will lose no time\nin doing Y\u201d is ambiguous between \u201cX will not do Y\u201d and \u201cX will begin doing Y\nimmediately.\u201d\nIII. Fallacy of Accent\nWhen interpretations of a statement can be changed by placing emphasis on different\nsyllables or terms in the statement, the statement is accent-ambiguous. The fallacy of\naccent is committed when one interpretation is used to gain acceptance of the premise but\na different interpretation is used in drawing the conclusion.\nIn the following examples, the statement, \u201cI believe that all men are created equal\u201d is\nambiguous in at least five different ways, depending on what word is accented in using\nthe statement as a premise.\n(1) I believe that all men are created equal. However, that does not require\nthat you believe that all men are created equal. Therefore, you are not obligated to\npractice non-discrimination as I do.\n(2) I believe that all men are created equal. However, what I believe need not\nbe the case. Therefore, it may be that in fact all men are not equal.\n(3) I believe that all men are created equal. But this certainly does not\nextend to women. Therefore, I oppose the Equal Rights Amendment to the\nconstitution. The Founding Fathers didn't believe women were equal to men\neither.\n340 (4) I believe that all men are created equal. But once their creation is\nfinished, some men work harder than others. The social equalities we see\nbetween men are no more created by God than the mighty skyscrapers we see\nas we drive through our nation's capital. But just because God didn't\ncreate skyscrapers during the six days he took to create the solar system,\nthat doesn't mean that we should therefore destroy them. And neither\nshould we destroy social inequalities.\n(5) I believe that all men are created equal. That means that no person has a\nright to certain kinds of opportunity that other people do not have an\nequal right to. Therefore, I believe that if a man can be operated on so\nthat he is implanted with a functional womb, then he should be allowed the\nopportunity to give birth to a baby.\nB. Category Fallacies\nThis group of fallacies - the fallacy of division and the fallacy of composition- involves\nequivocation between: (a) using a term to refer to a class as a whole and (b) using the\nterm to refer to a member of that class.\nThe fallacy of division takes what is true of the whole to be true of all the parts. The\nfallacy of division arises when a concept is used as a collective unit in the premise, then a\nconclusion (based on the truth of that premise) is drawn in which the same concept is\napplied to an individual unit of the collection.\n(1) America is the richest country in the world.\nSince you are an American, you must be rich.\n(2) Smith has a better basketball team than Wellesley. Mary is a player on Smith's\nteam. Phyllis is a player on Wellesley\u2019s team. Therefore, Mary is a better basketball\nplayer than Phyllis.\nThe fallacy of composition derives from taking what is true of a part to be true of the\nwhole. This is the reverse of the fallacy of division. Here a claim is made about the\n341 individual elements of the subject term in the premises, yet a conclusion is drawn in\nwhich the claim is applied, not to the individuals, but to the collection as a whole.\n(1) Each individual on the team is over 6 feet tall.\nTherefore, the team is over 6 feet tall.\n(comment: teams do not have height.)\n(2) Each apple in the basket weighs less than a pound.\nTherefore, the basket of apples weighs less than a pound.\n(3) Each of us acting individually can do little to make institutional changes.\nTherefore, there is very little we can do together to make institutional changes.\n(4) All material things are made of atoms\nAll atoms are invisible to the naked eye.\nAll material things are invisible to the naked eye.\n6. B. 1. Exercises: Name the fallacy involved in each of the following arguments.\n1. You said you'd pay $500.00 for each pound of weed I brought you. Well, I just\nfinished mowing every lawn in the neighborhood and I have 100 pounds of weeds in\nthese green bags. Therefore, you owe me $50,000.\n2. Under normal circumstances water placed over a fire in a pan will boil. This fire is in a\npan. Therefore, when I put this water over it, the water should boil.\n3. Students at Amherst College are only allowed to take five courses per semester.\nAmherst provides the staff to teach the courses. Therefore, Amherst provides staff to\nteach five courses per semester.\n4. Each member of the Smith basketball team is a high scorer. Therefore, the Smith\nbasketball team will make a lot of high scores this season.\n5. Since each soldier in the regiment has been well trained, it follows that\nthe regiment must be a superb fighting unit.\n6. Since you said that the food was \"sick,\" we may conclude that you would not\nrecommend that restaurant as having delicious food.\n342 7. The average American family has two and a half children. You are an\naverage American family, therefore, you have two-and-a-half children.\n8. The jury was unable to come to a verdict as to whether the defendant was guilty.\nTherefore each of the jurors was unable to make up his or her mind.\n9. Rights within the State should always be balanced by responsibilities to the State.\nTherefore, those with the most civil rights ought to shoulder most of the responsibilities\nof government.\n10. Rights within the State should always be balanced by responsibilities to\nthe State. Therefore, those who make the least contribution to the State should have the\nleast civil rights.\n11. John said that he would give Tom and Mary $5,000.00. John always tells the\ntruth. Therefore John will give Tom $5,000.00.\n12. Whooping cranes are becoming extinct. That bird is a whooping crane. Therefore,\nthat bird is becoming extinct.\n13. A brick is very small. Therefore, a building made of brick must be very small.\n14. Flour tastes horrible. And since it is the main ingredient in bread, bread\nmust taste horrible.\n15. Much religious teaching is contained in the Bible. The Bible is a word of\nfive letters. Therefore, much religious teaching is contained in a word of five letters.\n16. The Consumer Report says: \u201cWe cannot recommend this car too highly.\u201d\nTherefore, I should not buy that car.\n17. The killing of the hunters is regrettable, my neighbor said. Therefore, my\nneighbor must be against hunting.\n18. College graduates make on the whole more money than non-college graduates. Thus,\nsince you are a college graduate and I am not, you must make more money than me.\n19. A feather is very light. Therefore, a mountain of feathers is very light.\n20. Mr. Senator, individual liberty is not being threatened or abused by the CIA because\nit authorizes only twenty categories of domestic and international espionage. This is a\nsmaller number than any other country in the world. (The suggestion is that there were\nonly twenty cases of domestic and international espionage carried out by the CIA).\n343 21. Since I lifted each piece of wood that went into making this table, I must be able to\nlift the table.\n22. The boss interviewing an young attractive secretary told her she could expect\nfrequent advances. Therefore, she readily accepted the job.\n23. Both hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) are highly flammable. Therefore, H2O must\nbe highly flammable.\n24. The house that you live in is large so it must have large closets.\n25. I'm not worried that the six Beasley boys are coming to fight me. I've whipped each\nof than, so I know I'll be able to whip them again.\nC. Fallacies With Valid Argument Forms\nFormal fallacies are arguments that are defective because they have invalid argument\nforms. But while all invalid arguments are fallacious, it is not the case that all fallacious\narguments are invalid. Indeed, many fallacious arguments have valid argument forms.\nFor instance, the argument \u201cAll dogs are from outer space because all dogs are cats and\nall cats are from outer space\u201d is fallacious, even though it has a valid argument form. It is\nfallacious because its premises are unacceptable and therefore do not lead us to accept the\nconclusion as true. Whenever a conclusion is asserted to have a certain truth-value on the\nbasis of premises that are unacceptable, the argument is unsound and therefore fallacious.\nMany informal fallacies are a species of unsound arguments.\nGenerally, informal fallacies involve arguments that have faulty premises. Typically, the\npremises of such arguments are not stated explicitly (enthymemes), and the listener is led\nto accept them without careful examination. In what follows, we will introduce some of\nthe most common forms of informal fallacies.\nI. Appeal to the Person (Ad Hominem)\nThe fallacy of ad hominem is committed when the conclusion of an argument is rejected,\nnot because of objections to the premises or steps connecting the premises to the\n344 conclusion, but because of objections to the character and/or circumstances of the\nindividual presenting the argument. This is illustrated in the following examples:\n1a. Mr. A: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to argue that a law\nrequiring the mandatory sentencing of individuals convicted of drug use\nshould not be passed. For such a law would require so much\nmoney to implement that we would have to increase taxes and cut back on the\nschool budget, benefits for the elderly, and police and fire protection.\n1b. Mr. B: Ladies and gentlemen, you should not accept Mr. A's argument\nagainst the mandatory sentencing of criminals convicted of drug use.\nFor Mr. A is a former drug user himself, and is currently\nfree on probation. If we had a mandatory sentencing law,\nMr. A would not be here before you tonight.\n2a. Mr. C: Everyone should make a sincere effort to become a true\nChristian because that is the only way we are going to solve\nthe world's problems.\n2b. Mr. D: I don't agree with Mr. C because I don't trust anything he\nsays. I've known Mr. C all my life and I know for a fact\nthat he is not a true Christian. He's just a lying hypocrite.\nOf course, there is nothing wrong in questioning the reliability or credibility of a person.\nThis is often done by lawyers in courtroom cases. To do so is not to commit the ad\nhominem fallacy, for the purpose of the questioning is to provide grounds for doubting\nthe truthfulness of the witness. Thus, the following situations must be carefully\ndistinguished:\n(3a) Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, you should not accept the\narguments of the attorney for the defense, because he is a\nknown liar.\n(3b) Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, you should not accept the\ntestimony of this witness because the witness is a known liar.\n345 The statements in (4b) speak to whether certain statements alleged to be true by the\nwitness are in fact true. If a person is known to misrepresent truth for personal gain,\npsychological release, or whatever reason, then the probability increases that under\ncurrent circumstances he may be misrepresenting the facts. And if the truth-value of the\npremises is indeterminate, then the truth-value of the conclusion of that argument is also\nindeterminate. On the other hand, if there is no question as to the authenticity of all the\nevidence presented, then it is only to the validity of the argument into which that\nevidence is incorporated that criticism can be directed. In this case, one must show that\nthe facts do not fit together in one's opponent's argument. It is no good to attack the\ncharacter of the opposing attorney, as in (4a). The opposing attorney may be scrupulous\nin presenting witnesses that tell the truth and a genius at constructing clever arguments,\nyet be a scoundrel in her personal life.\n4a. If A has a bad character then A\u2019s argument should be rejected.\nA has a bad character.\nA\u2019s argument should be rejected\n4b. If A has a bad character then A\u2019s argument should be suspect.\nA has a bad character.\nA\u2019s argument should be suspect.\n4a is an invalid argument, because an argument cannot be discredited by attacking its\nmaker. An argument can only be challenged on two fronts: the truth-value of its premises\nand the validity of its form. If the truth of the assumptions proposed is guaranteed by\nsomeone whose truthfulness is suspect, then that person's guarantee is suspect. Thus,\nthose assumptions may be considered insufficient to establish the truth of the conclusion\nin question. The other basis for rejecting the argument is whether the argument form is\nvalid. But the validity of an argument form is independent of the trustworthiness of the\nmaker of the argument, because the validity of an argument form is independent of the\nactual truth or falsity of the statements that make it up.\n346 The ad hominem fallacy is also committed is in what is called the \u201cYou also!\u201d (Tu\nquoque) argument. Here, the accused defends herself by charging the accuser of having\ncommitted the same act she is being prosecuted for. The erroneous premise of such\narguments is that the accused should not be held responsible for doing x if others have\ndone x without being held equally responsible.\n(5) Members of the American military should not be prosecuted for killing civilians\nduring the war in Iraq. Al Qaeda has practiced the killing of civilians as part of its holy\nwar tactics. Yet, Al Qaeda sympathizers have not condemned Al Qaeda. So, members of\nthe American military should not be condemned and punished when others are doing the\nsame thing.\n(6) Senator X has accused me of being financed by Big Business. Well, in reply let\nme point out that much of the money for Senator X\u2019s campaign has come from Big\nBusiness.\n(7) American presidents defended legalized segregation by pointing out that many\nother countries violated the rights of certain groups of their own citizens.\nObserve that, in the tu quoque (you also!) argument, A argues that B\u2019s accusation about\nA should be rejected because B is guilty of a similar offense. Thus, attention is redirected\nfrom the charge to the maker of the charge. But even if the counter-accusation is true, this\ndoes not imply that the original accusation was false. To answer an allegation of\nmisconduct by citing the accuser's similar misconduct is only a means of confusing the\nissue. What is needed in order to meet an accusation is not a counter accusation, but an\nargument showing that the accusation being made is unwarranted.\nII. Appeal to Authority (Ad Verecundiam)\nIn this fallacy, reverence for a particular authority is used to gain acceptance of a\nparticular conclusion, without due consideration of the reasons advanced by the authority\nin support of that conclusion. The corrective to the fallacy of appealing to authority is to\n347 examine the argument used by the authority to come to the conclusion in question, and to\nbase our acceptance or rejection of the conclusion on that argument, not merely on our\nrespect for the maker of the argument. Authorities appealed to may be as varied as the\nBible, one's parents, respected teachers, newspapers, a popular actor or actress, a sports\ncelebrity and so on. Consider the following examples:\n(1) The Pope has declared that from the moment of conception, the fetus is\na human being and hence, that abortion is murder. Since the Pope said\nit, abortion must therefore be murder.\n(2) Dr. John Kalk, the noted physician and Nobel Prize winner, says that\nup until the third month, the fetus has more in common with a monkey\nthan with a human being, and therefore, that abortion prior, to the\nthird month is not murder. Since Dr. Kalk is a noted scientist, if he\nsays that abortion is not murder, then it must not be murder.\n(3) The president said that it was necessary to relinquish the Panama\nCanal in order to maintain stability in Central America. Since he's\nthe president, he ought to know what's best. So we may conclude that\nwe should have relinquished the Panama Canal.\nEach of these examples has the form:\nIf authority A says that P is true, then P is true.\nAuthority A says that P is true.\nP is true.\nWhile this is a valid argument, it is not necessarily a sound one. The premise, \u201cIf\nauthority A says that P is true, then P is true\u201d is not always true. Any authority may be\nwrong some times. Authorities are called upon when specialized knowledge is required in\norder to determine if P is true. If A has such specialized knowledge, then A's opinion\nconcerning the truth or falsity of P is more likely to be correct than the opinion of persons\nnot in possession of such knowledge. However, there are often cases where two or more\nindividuals with equivalent degrees of specialized knowledge nonetheless disagree as to\nthe truth or falsity of P. When experts disagree, then judges and juries must consider the\nevidence, reasons, and arguments of representative experts.\n348 Some further examples of appeal to authority are:\n(4) Hyrd station wagons are superior to other brands of station wagons\nbecause Knut Ruckney, football coach of Notre Dame, drives a Hyard\nand says that Hyrd makes the best station wagon in the world.\n(5) Doxema is the best shave cream on the market because Eli Kanning, the\nwell-known quarterback, uses it.\nThese examples illustrate how the proposition \u201cIf authority A says that P is true, then P\nis true\u201d is not always true. The fact that Knut Ruckney might be an authority on football\ndoes not mean that he is an authority on automobiles. An authority in one field is not\nnecessarily an authority in another. Yet, advertising suggests that an authority in one field\nis equally an authority in another when individuals who excel in one area (sports, music,\nscience, etc.) are asked to testify concerning issues in an entirely different area.\nIII. Appeal to Ignorance (Ad Ignorantiuam)\nThis fallacy arises when an argument is accepted (or rejected), not as a result of an\nexamination of the relationship between its premises and conclusion, but rather as a result\nof ignorance of key concepts used in the argument. Because of the need for specialized\nknowledge, this fallacy is often combined with an appeal to authority.\n(1) Amplifier A has 25 KMI per channel. Amplifier B has 40 KMT per channel. They\ncost the same. Therefore, Amplifier B is the best buy.\n(more examples needed)\nIV. Appeal to the Mob (Ad Populum)\nThis fallacy is committed when an audience is induced to accept a certain conclusion on\nthe basis of appeal to interests, preferences, and values common to the speaker and the\naudience. Such arguments have the following general form:\n349 If we have the same values and interests, then P is true.\nWe have the same values and interests.\nP is true.\nSpeaker: \u201cDo you want freedom of speech?\u201d\nCrowd: \u201cYes!\u201d\nSpeaker: \u201cDo you want to be ruled by a dictatorship?\u201d\nCrowd: \u201cNo!\u201d\nSpeaker: \u201cDo you want a decent 1iving?\u201d\nCrowd: \u201cYes!\u201d\nSpeaker: \u201cThen we want the same things. So vote for me and let's\nmake the world safe for democracy.\u201d\nRufus Dufus was caught at the scene of the crime. A good, upstanding\nwoman just like our wives, sisters and mothers, said she was assaulted. Is this what\nwe want for our womenfolk? Is this what we are going to allow our\ndaughters to face when they grew up. No! We must have law and order\nand safety for our loved ones. We have to let vicious criminals know\nthat we will not stand for such atrocities. So let's string Rufus up\nnow and set an example that such will not be tolerated in this town.\nV. Appeal to Pity (Ad Misericordiam)\nCompassion is an important human emotion. It is good and necessary that we should feel\nconcern for the plight of others. But this does not mean that our actions must always be\nguided by our feelings. Unfortunately, there is often sincere confusion on this point. To\nillustrate, suppose A is approached by a handicapped beggar and A gives him money. She\nmight explain her action by saying that she was moved by pity to help the beggar. The\nframework for her action would then be given the following argument:\nIf I feel pity for x, then I should help x.\nI feel pity for x.\nI should help x.\n350 This is certainly a valid argument, but not always a sound one. It is possible that she\nmight be moved to feel pity by an imposter. Though she felt pity, it is unlikely that she\nwould help the imposter purely because of what she felt. A more suitable justification for\nher act of compassion would be:\nIf I believe x needs help, then I should help x.\nI believe x needs help.\nI should help x.\nIf what we believe provides the framework for our actions, then whether we feel pity or\nnot becomes irrelevant to whether we try to provide aid. We may feel pity but believe\nthat help is not needed or we may believe help is needed without feeling pity. Logic\nencourages us to guide our actions, not merely by our feelings, but by our assessment of\nthe situation and the moral principles we are committed to. The following examples\nillustrate situations in which a fallacious appeal to pity is made the basis for accepting a\nparticular conclusion.\n(1a) Student:\n\u201cProfessor, I lost my job last week, my mother became\nseriously ill, and now it seems that I may not pass\nyour course. If I fail, I don't know if I will be able\nto stand the strain of all my bad luck. If you have\nany feelings at all you should give me a passing grade\nin this course.\u201d\n(1b) Professor:\n\u201cI sympathize with your bad luck, Ms. Student, but I\nam prohibited from allowing my feelings about you to\ninfluence the grade that I give for this course.\u201d\n(2a) Defense:\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, my client was born\nin poverty. His father was killed in Iraq and\nhis mother was afflicted with multiple sclerosis when\nhe was three years old. He tried hard to stay in\nschool but was forced to work in order to bring food\n351 home to his sick mother. I ask you, ladies and\ngentlemen of the jury, not to impose yet another burden\non my client. I ask you to find him not guilty of the\ncrime he is accused of.\u201d\n(2b) Prosecutor:\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, I share with the\ndefense a concern for the misfortunes that the accused\nhas suffered. But that has nothing to do with the\nactual fact of whether or not he committed the crime\nhe is accused of. All the evidence points to the\nconclusion that he did commit that crime. Therefore,\nwe are bound by law to find the defendant guilty.\u201d\nIn example (1b) the professor may believe that the student deserves aid because of her\nunfortunate situation, but he is expressly forbidden by the code of the university from\noffering a passing grade as aid. Likewise, the members of the jury in example (2b) may\nfeel compassion for the defendant, but they too are expressly forbidden by the codes of\nlaw from acquitting the defendant purely on the basis of their feeling of compassion and\nbelief that he deserves aid. These examples show how the kind of aid we are allowed to\ngive is often limited by the codes, principles, and rules governing our social roles. The\nprofessor is prohibited from giving a grade on any criteria except that of classroom\nperformance. A jury is prohibited from acquitting a defendant on any grounds except\ninsufficient evidence. The fact that a store clerk feels or believes that the destitute person\noutside the store needs help is not a legitimate justification for giving that person\nmerchandise that has not been paid for.\nVI. Appeal to Force (Ad Baculum)\nWhen it is suggested to a person that dire consequences will befall her if she does not\naccept (or reject) a given conclusion, we have an appeal to force. In such cases, the\nconclusion is accepted (or rejected) on the basis of fear induced by a suggested threat.\nIf you do not wish to suffer harm, then you will do x.\nYou do not wish to suffer harm.\nYou will do x.\n352 While this is a valid argument, there are nonetheless many situations in which one is\nexpressly forbidden from acting on the basis of the premise \u201cIf you do not wish to suffer\nharm, then you will do x.\u201d\n(1a) Student:\n\u201cProfessor, I beat a man up real bad who didn\u2019t\ngive me what I wanted. Therefore, you'd better\ngive me a passing grade in this course.\u201d\n(1b) Professor:\n\u201cI certainly do not want to be beaten up.\nBut nonetheless I am expressly forbidden from\nawarding you a passing grade in this course for\nsuch a reason.\u201d\n(2) Mr. B:\n\u201cJones, you've been an employee of mine for a\n1ong time and I know you want to keep your job.\nTherefore, I hope you'll find time to help my\nfriend, Senator Tydings, in his re-election campaign.\u201d\n(3) Mafia Boss:\n\u201cMs. Smith, you've had this store for many years\nwithout any serious accidents. I know you want to\nkeep it that way. But a number of store owners\nwho don't carry my insurance policy have recently\nexperienced horrible fires that have closed down\ntheir businesses. I hope you\u2019ll buy my insurance policy.\u201d\nVII. Appeal to Pride\nIn the appeal to pride, the attempt is made to influence a person's acceptance or rejection\nof a certain conclusion by making that conclusion appear as a reflection of the person's\ncharacter. The person's desire to improve and enhance his or her self-image becomes the\nprimary factor determining the acceptance or rejection of the conclusion in question.\nArguments that appeal to pride generally have the following form:\n353 If you want to be admired then you will do X.\nYou want to be admired.\nYou will do X.\nExamples:\n(1) Student:\n\u201cProfessor, I know you wouldn't want people to think that I failed your course because of\nthe inadequacy of your teaching. Therefore, you should give me at least a passing grade\nin this course.\u201d\n(2) Salesman:\n\u201cMr. Stowson, you look to be a man of quality. Therefore, I know you will only want the\nbest that we have to offer.\u201d\n(3) Friend:\n\u201cSocrates, if you do not escape with us tonight, people will think you do no value your\nlife. Therefore, you must try to escape with us.\u201d\n6.C.1. Exercises:\nName the fallacy involved in each of the following arguments:\n1. Jones\u2019 argument should not be accepted because Jones is a drug addict and an\nalcoholic.\n2. My parents always voted for the Democratic party and what was good enough for my\nparents is good enough for me.\n3. The Bible says that the Children of Israel are the chosen people. Therefore, Israel is\nthe land of the chosen people.\n4. We all have families. We have churches and schools that we attend together. And we\nhave our right as citizens to choose our government representatives. For me, that choice\nwill be Bill Brent, and I know you\u2019ll make him your choice as well.\n354 5. Car A has a 470 cubic inch motor while car B has a 370 cubic inch motor. You should\nchoose car A because it gives you more engine volume.\n6. Everybody is smoking weed, so it must be good for you.\n7. Native American people have suffered ever since Europeans came to this country.\nThat is why Native American people should be given more welfare benefits.\n8. The Venezuelan government should not nationalize oil production in Venezuela\nbecause the United States will consider that an economic threat and might move to\ndestabilize the Venezuelan government.\n9. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this young man comes from a family of convicted\ncriminals. His mother, father, and each of seven sisters and brothers have been convicted\nof charges from murder to stock market fraud. Therefore, his attorney\u2019s arguments in his\nbehalf should be ignored, and the evidence accepted as proving him guilty of the charges\nbeing brought against him.\n10. The doctor says that I need an operation. Well, I suppose since he's\nthe doctor, he ought to know. So I guess I'll have to have it.\n11. Seventy percent of the people of Falls Point, Virginia own Yototas.\nIsn't that reason enough for you to make a Yotota your next car?\n12. IQ test scores have shown a positive correlation of 0.25 with academic\nperformance and professional success. That is why they should be continued\nin all our schools.\n13. Since you have a wife and four children and you want to keep your job, I\nbelieve you should contribute to mayor Rabby's campaign fund.\n14. Jim broke both his legs during the war. He hasn't spoken to any of his\nfriends since he's been out of the hospital. But when he saw you, his\nwhole personality changed. That's why you should go out with him tonight.\n355 15. Dr. Joan Saudelby, noted psychiatrist, recommends extramarital sex for\nrelease of tension. Therefore, married couples would be more relaxed if\nthey engaged in more extramarital affairs.\n16. One thousand, one hundred, and twenty-six cross tabulations of significant\ndata has shown that Michton shock absorbers out-perform all its major\ncompetitors. So you should buy Michton.\n17. Most people in my hometown don't agree with same-sex marriage. That's why I'm\nagainst it.\n18. Dr. Philip Whatley, noted ophthalmologist, considers La Plume de la France\nto be the best restaurant in town. Therefore, it must serve excellent food\nand give excellent service, for Dr. Whatley is famous around the world.\n19. Sheriff, you should not charge me with jaywalking because I've seen\nyou do it hundreds of times.\n20. Yes, I knew I've been late to work everyday this month. But how could you\nfire me? I have a child and I have to get up and dress the child and get\nher to a babysitter. If I don't have a job, how can I take care of my\nbaby? You just can't fire me.\n21. Ms. Priscilla, I know you need to pass this course in order to graduate, but your work\nand attendance has been marginal. Therefore, I suggest that you meet me this evening so\nthat we can pursue this matter further.\n22. I don't feel that I'm guilty of adultery because my wife is doing the same\nthing that I am doing.\n23. What were the most memorable events of your life? When you made that great\nplay that saved the game? When you graduated from high school? When you\ngot married? When you had your first baby? To these you will add your\nfirst experience of Dogen Mavid after-dinner wine. So try some today.\n356 24. Independent laboratory tests of ninety-seven random samples of Create natural\ndeodorant did not vary by more than 0.3% from natural body odor. That\u2019s why you\nshould switch to Create deodorant.\n25. Archie Ali, the new heavyweight boxing champ of the world says that if you want the\nheavyweight champ of car waxes, get DuraBond Carwax.\nD. Miscellaneous Fallacies\na. Fallacy of Contradictory Precepts\nThe fallacy of contradictory precepts occurs when incompatible premises are used to\ndraw a certain conclusion, The problem is that from incompatible premises, any\nconclusion whatsoever can be validly deduced.\n\u201cGive to the church\u201d, cried the minister. \u201cIt is easier for a camel to pass through the eye\nof a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. So, if you are able to\ngive, you had better give. And remember too, whatever riches you give to God, He will\ngive back to you tenfold. So give all you have.\u201d1\n(More Examples Needed)\nb. Arguing in a Circle (Vicious Circle)\nAn argument is circular if the conclusion of the argument occurs as one of the premises\nof the argument.\n(1) Heroin causes addiction because it has addictive powers.\n(2) Capitalism causes misery because its basic tendency is to make people suffer.\n1 The first premise implies that a person should give to the church in order to avoid being rich, while the\nsecond premise implies that a person should give to the church in order to receive even greater riches.\n357 c. Complex Questions\nA question is \u201ccomplex\u201d when any attempt to answer it implies the acceptance of\nstatements that are themselves in question.\nExamples:\nLawyer to Accused: \u201cTell the court, Sir, how it felt to have so much\nmoney after the holdup?\u201d\nWhy is it that wealthy people are more intelligent than poor people?\nd. Idealization of the Future\nHere, one is influenced to accept a conclusion by appeal to some idealized future\noutcome that one is prone to hope for.\n(1) \u201cJohn, you ought to go to college because when you graduate,\nyou can get a good job and never have any more financial\nproblems.\u201d\n( 2 ) \u201cBill, you don't need to go to school because everything is crumbling and we\u2019ll all\nbe given enough to eat by the government.\u201d\ne. Idealization of the Past\nHere, one is influenced to accept a framework for acting by appeal to some idealized past\nstate of affairs that one is prone to accept.\n(1) Europeans should be eliminated from America because before they came,\nNative Americans lived in harmony with nature.\n(2) The Black man should be eliminated from America because,\nbefore slavery, all Europeans were industrious and hard working.\nf. Fa1lacy of the Special Case (Hasty Statistical generalization)\nTo argue that whatever is true of one special case must be true of all cases of that general\nkind is to commit the fallacy of the special case. What is true of one individual need not\nbe true of all individuals of a like kind. Just because one presidential administration was\ndeceitful, we should not conclude that all presidential administrations are and will be\ndeceitful.\n358 Examples:\nBill Clinton was unfaithful while in office. We need to be wary of these white\nsoutherners.\nOften, extreme cases are presented as the standard by which some present issue or\nactivity is to be compared:\n\u201cI'm not a genius. Therefore, you can't expect me to always think before I act.\u201d\nSUMMARY\nThe validity of an argument or explanation is determined by the relationship between its\npremises and conclusion, and is independent of how we feel about the situation or subject\nmatter. The logician is like a building inspector whose job is to determine whether a\nhouse has a sound structure, irrespective of whether the house is personally appealing or\nnot. Thus, an argument may be valid though one does not wish to accept it. This is like\nfinding a solidly constructed house that nonetheless you would not want to live in. On the\nother hand, an argument may appeal to one even though (upon inspection) we find that\nthe argument is not valid. This is like finding a house that you would like to live in, only\nto find (upon inspection) that the house is not soundly constructed. Even if the house is\nstructurally sound, it may be constructed of materials that are toxic.\nIn this chapter we have been concerned with the various means whereby one can be\ninfluenced to accept an argument or explanation without carefully inspecting the\nargument for its validity and soundness. By manipulating the attention of the listener, a\npresenter might be able to influence the listener to accept or reject an argument without\nchecking it for soundness. Likewise, a realtor may emphasize the beautiful view from the\n1iving room window, but this does not mean that the house is soundly constructed.\n359 6.C.2. Exercises: Name the fallacy involved in the following examples.\n1. Why is abortion murder? Because it is the killing of an innocent human being.\n2. Defense lawyer cross-examining a witness: \u201cWhen did you stop beating your\nwife?\u201d\n3. As a candidate for governor of this state, I will treat all citizens\nequally and I will fight for the interests of big business.\n4. Tying a game is like kissing your mother. It is not much of a victory.\n5. If only Jack Pardee, the Washington Redskins football coach, had not been\nso conservative with his offense, the team could have won more games and\nPardee would not have been fired.\n6. If you go to college and earn a B.A. degree, then you will surely get a\nbetter paying job and be able to support your family better.\n7. Back in my day, we rode bicycles to school. Kids today should ride\nbicycles, not buses to school.\n8. This action is ethical. It is ethical because it is morally right. And we know it\nis morally right because it is not unethical.\n360 Outline of Natural Deduction: Propositional and Predicate Calculus\nPropositional Calculus\nThe aim of logic is to alert us to fallacious forms of reasoning that can lead to incorrect\nconclusions. We have shown how to test whether an argument is valid using truth tables. But\nwhen the argument is made up of many individual propositions, we may not be able to use truth\ntables because of the number of computations required. Truth tables are not how we ordinarily\nevaluate an argument\u2019s validity.\n(Illustrate)\nA more natural way of determining validity is to identify the conclusion and then show\nhow it can be derived from the premises provided, using only accepted valid inference rules. The\nvalid rules of inference make it possible to construct and assess arguments by natural deduction.\nIf each step in deriving the conclusion from the premises is justified, then we will have proven\nthat the conclusion in question is a valid consequence of the premises being used. Thus, if the\npremises are true, then its conclusion must be true.\nA proof of C is constructed by identifying: the conclusion (C); the premises (Pn) that C is\nsupposed to be inferred from; and the inference rules (Rn) used to derive C from Pn. Beginning\nwith the premises, we infer each subsequent proposition by applying a specific valid inference\nrule to specific prior lines in the proof. As long as each step in the derivation of C from Pn is\njustified by a recognized rule of inference, the conclusion C is justified.1\n1 Parenthetically, these are the basic assumptions of a deterministic universe. For if we could identify all the true\nfacts about reality, and all the valid rules of inference, we could then we construct all possible truths about reality,\npast and future.\n361 As we saw in classical logic, immediate inferences require only one premise. Thus, if \u2018no\nrats are dogs\u2019 is true, we can infer that \u2018no dogs are rats\u2019 is true. And if \u2018Some dogs are brown\u2019 is\ntrue, we can infer immediately that \u2018No dogs are brown\u2019 is false. But if \u2018all dogs are canines\u2019 is\ntrue, we cannot infer that \u2018all canines are dogs\u2019 is true: some immediate inferences are valid and\nsome are invalid.\nFollowing are valid immediate inference rules that have been identified for the\npropositional calculus. The reader is encouraged to carefully assess each, in order to be\nconvinced that the rule allows only valid inferences. First, we will consider valid inferences that\nhave only one proposition as its premise. A conclusion, C, is derived from a premise, P1, if there\nis a rule of inference that justifies inferring C from P1.\nImmediate Inferences using only a single proposition (p)\n1.

The following are syllogistic inference rules, and each requires the use of\ntwo premises to infer a conclusion. A conclusion, C, is derived from premises, P1 and P2, if\nthere is a rule of inference that justifies inferring C from P1 and P2.\nThe following four syllogistic rules of inference are widely used in ordinary and\nprofessional discourse: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, and Disjunctive\nSyllogism.\n13. Modus Ponens (MP) p \u00c9 q / p // q\np \u00c9 q\np\nq\nIf Jamie cleans her room then Ms Flotmos will take Jamie for a treat.\nJamie cleans her room.\nMs Flotmos will take Jamie for a treat.\n14.

Constructive Dilemma (CD)\n( p \u00c9 q) . ( r \u00c9 s) / ( p v r ) // ( q v s )\nIn syllogisms, a conclusion, C, is derived from premises, P1 and P2, if there\nis a rule of inference that justifies inferring C from P1 and P2.\nSuppose we are given the following syllogism.\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) \u00c9 (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t)\n(j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\nThis argument has 8 propositions (p,q,r,m,s,t,j,k), so a truth table would have 256 lines. But we\ncan see that the argument has the general form of MP:\nA \u00c9 B\nA\nB\n368 We can therefore conclude that it is a valid argument, without having recourse to calculations.\nNow, suppose we are given the following argument:\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) \u00c9 (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n(~r .~m . s . t . p . q)\n(k v j v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) is not identical to (~r .~m . s . t . p . q). But by using\nthe rule of association, (p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) can be derived from\n(~r .~m . s . t . p . q) as follows:\n1 (p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) \u00c9 (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t) P1\n2 (~r .~m . s . t . p . q) P2\n3 [(~r .~m . s . t) . ( p . q)] 2, Assoc\n4 [( p . q) . (~r .~m . s . t) ] 3, Assoc\n5 ( p . q . ~r .~m . s . t) // 4,Assoc\n6 (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t) 1, 5 MP\nConsider the following argument:\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) \u00c9 (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n~(j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n~(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t)\nTo prove that this argument is valid using truth-tables would require a truth-table of 28 = 256\nlines. However, we can see that the conditional first premise and the negation of the consequent\n369 clause of the first premise allows us to derive the negation of the antecedent clause of the first\npremise by the inference rule MT.\nConsider the following argument:\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) \u00c9 (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n(j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t) \u00c9 (p . q. r. d . e . f)\n(p . q . ~r . ~m . s . t) \u00c9 (p . q. r. d . e . f)\nThis argument would also require a truth table of 256 lines to prove its validity. Yet we are\nconvinced that it is a valid argument because it has the HS syllogistic form. And any argument\nwith a HS form is a valid argument.\nLikewise we are convinced that the following argument is valid, not because of truth tables, but\nbecause we recognize that it has the form of a disjunctive syllogism, and any argument with a DS\nform is a valid argument:\n(p . q. r. d . e . f) v (j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n~ (p . q. r. d . e . f)\n(j v k v ~m v ~r v s v t)\n370 Examples: (need example using HS)\n1 p \u00c9 (q > r)\n2 r v p\n3 ~r // q \u00c9 r\n4 p 2, 3 DS\n5 q \u00c9 r 1, 4 MP\n1 ~(p \u00c9 q) \u00c9 (~r > s)\n2 (p \u00c9 q) \u00c9 r\n3 ~r // s\n4 ~(p \u00c9 q) 2, 3 MT\n5 ~r \u00c9 s 1, 4 MP\n6 s 5, 3 MP\n1 p\n2 p \u00c9 ~q\n3 ~q \u00c9 ~t\n4 t v s // s\n5 ~q 2, 1MP\n6 ~t 3, 5 MP\n7 s 4, 6 DS\n371 When we make an inference, only certain information out of all the information available to us is\nrelevant.

(There are exceptions to this in certain proof strategies used in natural\ndeduction.)\nExistential generalization (EG): Fa // ((cid:0)x) Fx valid\nIt is always valid to infer that something has the property F if we already know that a has that\nproperty.\nUniversal instantiation (UI): (x)Fx // Fa\nvalid\nIf it is true that all members of U1 have property F, then if a is a member of U1 then a must have\nthe property F.\n374 Existential instantiation (EI): ((cid:0)x) Fx // Fa invalid\nIf we know that some individual in U1 has the property F, we cannot conclude that a must be that\nindividual.\n(Exercises needed)\nThe 18 rules of propositional logic and the additional valid rules of predicate logic make\nit is possible to do natural deductions in both propositional and predicate logic. These formal\nlanguages make it possible to express ordinary and technical inferences in a form that can be\nused by modern information technology.\n(Exercises needed)\n375"
