{"text":"1. The Archive Strikes Back: Effects of\nOnline Digital Language Archiving\non Research Relations and Property\nRights\nThomas Widlok\nAn analysis of research implications regarding\ndigital archives of spoken language\nIn the framework of programmes for documenting endangered languages\nsuch as those funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and the Arcadia Fund,\nunprecedented amounts of audiovisual data on endangered languages and\ncultures from around the world are currently being electronically archived.\nThe expectation is that the materials collected will be more readily available\n(and for much longer) than previously, and available in ways that would\nbenefit a number of different groups of potential users, including speakers\nwho want to revitalise their languages and cultures. However, as I have\nargued elsewhere (Widlok 2010), the new electronic archives are not simply\na quantitative extension of existing modes of data collection, but they\nqualitatively alter the relationship between researchers and their products\nand, as a consequence, also the relations between the researched and these\nproducts and the relationship between researchers and their partners in the\nfield. The new possibilities of Internet-based digital archiving and online\ndatabases are much more than \"just technical\" innovations. Rather, the new\narchiving technology is also changing the ways in which we generate and\nshare knowledge. The first half of this paper, therefore, aims to lay out\nDOI: 10.111647\/OBP.0032.02.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 3 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nin some detail what is implied in the broad processes of electronic data\ngathering, digitisation, and online archiving.\nBreathing life into data cemeteries\nOne of the most prominent assurances of new digital archiving technologies\nis that it can help to prevent data loss and data cemeteries. In the past,\nmany recordings of spoken language have effectively been lost, not\nonly materially but also through being buried in personal archives. The\nproblem continues into the present and, arguably, it has been aggravated\nsince the costs of recording have dropped dramatically. For myself and\nmany colleagues, a major incentive to engage with digital archiving was\nto seek a strategy for coping with an ever-increasing private collection of\naudio- and videotapes, originating from various research projects over the\nyears, materials for which it became ever more difficult to find a machine\nthat would allow the data to be used in the future. Increasingly, there are\nalso recordings, usually audio tapes, produced and kept by members of\nthe speech community, but they frequently get recorded over after a while\nor are lost in closed collections. Field researchers tend to keep their data,\nbut this data often ends up in data cemeteries, boxes of tapes awaiting\ntranscription and translation. The prospects for these private collections\nare rather bleak: data loss due to media deterioration or due to the\ndecommissioning of research projects and careers. My personal motivation\nfor getting involved with the endangered languages programme DOBES\n(Dokumentation bedrohter Sprachen) of the Volkswagen Foundation, was\nthe hope that the audio-visual data that I had accumulated in years of field\nresearch with \u2260Akhoe Hai\/\/om in northern Namibia could be prevented\nfrom deterioration and could be made accessible to others. After several\nyears of running the project, many of my old tapes are now digitised and\narchived, but at the same time many more tapes have been added so that\nthe total amount of untranscribed and unanalysed data is actually greater\nthan what I started with. Moreover, the data collection has changed in ways\nthat I had not anticipated when I began digital archiving. While I initially\ntreated archives as passive \u201cdumping grounds\u201d it soon became clear that\nthe digital archive was striking back, prompting me to reconsider basic\nassumptions and to change some of the habitual ways of doing research.\nThe storage technology changed the record and changed the method of data\ngathering in at least three different ways, namely in terms of a departure\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 4 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 5\nfrom earlier holistic approaches, by fostering modularity and through the\nintroduction of standardised metadata.\nFarewell to holism\nThe composition of teams that make up documentation projects\nfunded by the research initiatives already mentioned above is typically\nheterogeneous. The interdisciplinary teams include anthropological\nand linguistic researchers at a number of different levels (post-doc, PhD,\nresearch assistants, interpreters etc.) and for different time periods (short\ncontracts, PhD projects, and as part of lifetime engagements). Since all\nmembers contribute to the data collection in different ways and at different\ntimes, the result is an open corpus very unlike the typical ethnographic\nmonograph or conventional linguistic collection of folk-stories that tend to\nbe holistic if not in scope then at least with regard to the fact that they are\npresented as a book or a similarly bounded entity. Ideally, the new digital\ncorpora are supposed to grow even after the funding period has ended as\nresearchers add to it and work on it for their various projects, and to various\ndegrees this ideal is in fact realised. The corpus is eventually shaped not\nonly by the original team of researchers but also by collaborators and by\ninterested colleagues whose actions shape at least part of the corpus as\nthey use it for a variety of purposes. This new set-up destroys any illusion\nthat one might have had as the author of an ethnographic monograph or\nlinguistic text collection in terms of holistic completeness and closure. On\nthe positive side of things, the digital corpus more honestly reflects the\nfact that any field research is a long-term process of accumulating and\nrevising knowledge, a process that tends to be hidden in the production\nof books and volumes. However, it remains to be seen how many of the\nnewly established corpora will indeed become living bodies instead of\nturning into yet larger data cemeteries. Given that the funding agencies\nguarantee to keep the data collection active for decades (by migrating\ndata to readable formats in the future), the chances are that we will see\nsome interesting developments concerning the social life of data files. An\ninevitable trade-off in this development is that researchers partly lose\ncontrol over the end product and, potentially, so do their informants. The\nresearcher may be able to discuss publications with informants before\nthey get printed, and will seek consent before things are recorded and\nput into an archive, but there is no way that a constantly growing and\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 5 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 6 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nchanging body of data that is subject to collective work and revision could\nbe controlled in the same way. I shall return to this point in the second half\nof this chapter.\nWelcome to modularity\nIt is tempting to look at digital archives as open-ended corpora that do\naway with the limitations of former collections of texts as indicated\nabove. However, this primary openness should not be confused with\namorphousness. For an electronic archive of spoken language to work, at\nleast in the current set-up provided by electronic archiving software, it\nhas to be organised in modules, usually called \u201csessions\u201d. These sessions\nare the basic units of data storage in electronic corpora. They can range\nfrom tiny one-sentence recordings to hours of videoed ceremonies and\nstory-telling events. Moreover, the system allows for (and even encourages)\nany one recording to be organised in more than a single session, but the\nrecording must minimally be part of one session (with metadata) in order\nto be visible in the corpus. The hypertext structure of the archive allows the\nunderlying digitised tapes to be cut and joined in as many different ways\nas those working with the corpus care to specify. In our own project, for\ninstance, we envisage that a healing dance that lasts several hours will form\none session as a dance event, but that sections from this dance may also\nform separate sessions. In another example (see Widlok 2010: 51), a folk\nstorytelling event may form a session of trickster stories, of cooperative\nstory telling or of mother-in-law taboo since the underlying event is each\nof these three, namely a young man and his mother-in-law jointly narrating\na trickster story.\nMoreover, some projects have already experimented with community\nplatforms that sort and present the data sessions not in terms of the\ncategorical system of comparative linguistics or comparative anthropology,\nbut in terms of what community members have found to be a useful\norganisation for their specific local purposes. In our own project, we have\nseen the beginnings of this in the use of sessions for community purposes: a\ncommon problem with largely egalitarian groups such as the \u2260Akhoe Hai\/\/\nom is that members do not easily speak for the community. When they get\ninvited to represent their community at meetings in the capital, they tend\nto say little out of fear of getting criticised for what they have said when\nthey return. This uneasiness to speak for others can be softened by using\nelectronically archived materials. At one recent NGO-run workshop in the\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 6 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 7\ncapital, the group members attending were showing video-clips (sessions\nfrom interviews) with voices from their home place. This allowed for more\nvoices to be heard at the meeting without the delegate being forced to\nrepresent others in the context of their own established social practice that\ndoes not operationalise representing others as it is required by government\nor non-governmental organisations. Until recently, anthropologists (or\nother intermediaries) have often felt pressed to take over the role of speaker\nfor the local community in these situations. Now they can take on the less\ncontentious role of facilitators who only provide the technical equipment\nfor what one may call a local appropriation of the archived materials.\nThe versatility of sessions as data clips is well established since YouTube\nand other Internet platforms have become ubiquitous sources. What is\noccasionally overlooked is the extent to which the often diffuse complexity\nof speech events and of ethnographic situations in which language is\nspoken becomes modularised with hard and fast boundaries so that we\ntake these models to be true representations of the events from which\nthey originate. In other words, there is a danger that the holistic illusion\nof a complete corpus that is dismantled in electronic corpora (see above)\ngets re-established at the level of sessions. In principle, there is no reason\nwhy we should not continue to cut new sessions from the original digital\nmedia files as we continue working, but in practice, the sessions\u2014once\nestablished\u2014tend to take on a life of their own.\nBetter data with meta-data?\nJust as an organisation of the corpus in terms of sessions seems inevitable in\nthe context of digital archiving, the same holds for the creation of metadata\nfiles that organise the data itself. To begin with, the sheer size of the data\ncollections discussed here makes metadata essential. There is no easy way\nto find relevant cues if one has to go through hours of audio or video\nrecording unless there is metadata that provides hints on the contents of\nthe recording. Other minimally required metadata includes information\nabout who collected, cut and processed the recording. Metadata is the\nmain channel whereby context is preserved in terms of who said what,\nto whom, and in what kind of setting. As soon as the material leaves the\nconfines of a private archive under the control of a researcher who can\ncomment on the circumstances and details of the recording, and as soon as\nit reaches a public archive with considerable longevity, metadata is critical\nfor contextualisation.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 7 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 8 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nCorrespondingly, archivists present metadata as the most critical\nresource for preventing the small data cemeteries mentioned above from\nbeing merged into huge data cemeteries. At this stage it becomes clear that,\neven with direct community involvement in compiling the corpus, digital\narchiving does not comply to the ideal of a dialogical research exercise with\nno power differentials. Clearly, the researchers who formulate the metadata\n(specifying participants, location, genres etc.) and the archivists who\nprovide the templates for the metadata (controlled vocabularies, drop-down\nmenus, boxes to be filled in) very much determine how sessions are\ndescribed and corpora are compiled. Having said that, this of course\nis also true for many, if not all, data compilations that field researchers\nhave hitherto come up with, be it text, audio, video or other. Context can\nnever been exhausted, and there is always a selection of context. Whatever\neffort is made to make local voices heard, choices about the compilation\nand composition of the record usually remain with the researcher. The\ndifference, compared to earlier practice, is that the metadata requirements\nof electronic archives render it necessary for the researcher to make his\nor her system of contextualisation open and explicit; and to agree with\nothers on some shared standard. We all categorise our information (and\nto some extent our informants do that, as well) in one way or another, and\nsimilarly the events and situations from which the data is being derived.\nThe metadata files in the corpora discussed here make it necessary to be\nexplicit about these categorisations. Many researchers who are devoted\nto a particular language (and language community) are uneasy about the\nstandardised categorisations of metadata descriptions. In any case, metadata\nspecifications provide the opportunity to reflect on these categories. A\nmajor gap in the metadata that we found in our own project (see Widlok,\nRapold and Hoymann 2008) is that the person-related information is usually\nindividualised. Considerable effort is made in electronic archives to allow\nfor a number of ways of anonymising speakers as individuals. However,\nthe effort to connect the person-related information into a network (for\ninstance of kin-relations between speakers) is still in its infancy. The\nmetadata currently provides a purely summative list of informants and, as\nyet, no knowledge about the participatory frameworks in which data was\ngenerated.1 In other words, research projects at present give information\nabout individual contributors, but not about the social links between\n1 For the importance of participatory frameworks for understanding spoken language see\nWilliam Hanks (1996: 142).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 8 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 9\nthem. \u201cKinOath\u201d, a new piece of software currently in development by\nPeter Withers at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen,\naims to close that gap. It is closely integrated with the \u201cArbil\u201d metadata\nmanagement tool.\nAn analysis of property and access rights regarding\ndigital archives of spoken language\nDigitisation not only affects the process of data collection and research but\nalso the possibilities and limitations of access to that data. I am here not\nconcerned with the (important) questions of access to digital technology\nand Internet connection\u2014which continues to be a problem in many parts of\nthe world\u2014but rather those issues of regulating and managing access that,\ntypically, linguists and anthropologists are expected to solve. Technically,\nthe question of access rights to the collected data is solved in the sense that\nthe archive allows researchers to categorise their data into different levels\nof access. Funding agencies like the Volkswagen Foundation would like the\ndefault level to be set at open and public so that all data (and not just the\nmetadata) is openly accessible unless a specific reason is given to make it a\ntemporarily restricted source. In fact, most project teams tend to see it the\nother way around. They open up very few selected show pieces for which\nthere is open access. The largest part of the body is limited access with\ntwo thresholds: the lower threshold consists of an automatised declaration\nwith which the user must agree along similar lines as agreements to\nInternet downloads and other web services. Instead of agreeing to a licence\nagreement, the user here agrees to have read the DOBES code of conduct\nand to comply with it in terms of protecting local communities and their\nintellectual property rights. The next threshold is that interested users have\nto get in touch with a responsible corpus manager (typically a member of\nthe research team) who can then advise the archivist to grant them access to\nselected sessions from the corpus. Typically, this allows fellow researchers\nto make use of the corpus while the research team maintains some control\nover who uses the data. Closed access only exists as a temporary measure\nthat is taken to grant researchers, especially PhD students, a period of\nexclusive use rights until they have completed their degree or publication.\nAs I have pointed out elsewhere (Widlok 12\u201313 June 2008), these uniform\nand clear-cut technical access categories are in stark contrast to issues of\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 9 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 10 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nproperty rights that are in most cases overlapping and of access rights that\nare typically shared, especially with regard to the long-term perspective.\nThe point to highlight here is that what changes with regard to earlier\nprocesses of granting or delimiting access is that we are no longer dealing\nwith a dyadic negotiation between researcher and researched. Rather,\nthere are now more parties involved: the funding agencies, with their open\naccess policies but also, potentially, community agencies, often following\nrestrictive practices and potentially in conflict with one another about who\nis the legitimate holder of the rights of the community. This raises the\nthorny issue of \u201cgroup rights\u201d and \u201ccultural property\u201d (see Barry 2001). We\nhave seen conflicts of this sort arise over the repatriation of ancestral bones\nand artefacts to present-day indigenous communities and this suggests\nthat similar problems may arise with electronically archived materials,\nespecially when individual informants (and the responsible researchers)\nare no longer alive. While there is a need to specify access rights in the\nmetadata, it is an illusion to think that this sufficiently accommodates\nfor the complexity of rights issues. A first step towards solving many\nquestions about property, I maintain, is to recognise at what level rights\nare actually claimed. In most cases property is made up of a bundle of\nrights (of ownership, of access, of use, of alienation, of inheritance) so that\nthe recognition of authorship need not imply rights at other levels (as any\nauthor of a scientific publication knows).\nA layered model of property and access rights\nMany conflicts and misunderstandings surrounding property rights\nin data result from the fact that different layers of property rights are\nnot sufficiently distinguished. For the purposes of this chapter we may\ndistinguish layers concerning 1) values, 2) regulations, 3) relations, and\n4) practices. For instance, we may all agree on certain values (such as the\nprotection of privacy and the openness of scientific results) but there may\nstill be debate about what kinds of regulations are best suited to realise\nthese values, especially if more than one value is to be considered. Apart\nfrom that, there are discrepancies that may arise between different layers\nthat make up complex property rights. I therefore suggest to apply to\ndigital archiving of spoken language a layered model of property relations\nthat has been developed in legal anthropology (see Benda-Beckmann and\nBenda-Beckmann 1999; and Widlok 2001). This model looks at property as\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 10 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 11\na bundle of rights at the level of values, regulations, relations and practices.\nWhile language documentation programmes tend to be fairly outspoken\nabout layers of values and regulations, they are less explicit about layers of\nsocial relationships and practice.\nCultural values of access\nIn a sense, cultural values of access is the most unproblematic layer of\nproperty rights, since there are a number of existing documents\u2014developed\nafter long discussions within the scientific community\u2014that can be referred\nto. The DOBES Code of Conduct (CoC) has been discussed extensively in\nthis regard; it also includes references to other existing codes.2 Note that\nthere are tensions built into all these codes since some values are at least\npotentially in conflict with one another, e.g. the right of privacy and the\nright of access to scientific results. This is the normal state of affairs and\ntherefore we should not shrink back from embracing these values, even if\nthey are partly in conflict with one another. This is why we need to look at\nthe other layers, which can take the sting out of these tensions.\nEach individual documentation team can refer to the relevant values\nthat are formulated in documents such as the code of conduct, i.e. the\nrespect towards intellectual and cultural property rights, the privacy\nof individuals, and the obligation to make the material accessible to\ninterested non-commercial uses. However, even if we assume that there\nwill be no changes in these values in the long-term future, inevitably,\nexisting tensions between values will be resolved in different ways\nat various points in time. The current tendency is clearly towards open\naccess. However, with increasing commoditisation, and possibly with the\nincreasing disappearance of languages, the tendency may shift towards\nrestricting access. The community of researchers now considers cultural\nheritage a treasure, but to some it may become a burden, too. The value of\narchiving may itself change in the future. It is not possible to foresee these\ndevelopments, since our knowledge increases as language documentation\ngrows. With spoken language materialising into data sessions and corpora\n2 For a list of relevant documents, see International Association of Sound and Audiovisual\nArchives (IASA)\u2019s Copyright & Other Intellectual Property Rights and The Hans Rausing\nProject for Endangered Languages\u2019 Online Resources for Endangered Languages. Ethical\nissues in Online Sources.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 11 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 12 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nwe may securely assume that the same dynamics are likely to emerge,\nthat anthropology has found to be implicated in \u201cthe social life of things\u201d\n(Appadurai 1986) in other domains of materialised culture. Given the\nlongevity of data collection, many more conflicts become possible that did\nnot apply when records of spoken language were more fleeting. As access\nrights will no longer be established once and for all but may change, these\nchanges will have to be traced. In concrete terms, this means that a time-tag\nis added to every step in the digital archiving process, not just when setting\nup the metadata but with every change made to the access regulations. In\nan archive of \u201cdata objects\u201d that can become subject to conflict, we need to\nknow who made which access decision, when, and for how long it is to be\neffective.\nCultural regulations\nThe cultural values of access are operationalised into regulations by the\nteams running digital archives (in consultation with researchers). In\nthe DOBES framework, there are a number of forms and rules such as\nthe Usage Request Form (DOBES-UR), the Depositor-Archivist Agreement\n(DOBES-DAA) and Usage Declaration (DOBES-UD), as well as the Data\nAccess and Protection Rules (DOBES-DAPR), which cover many aspects of\nwhat needs to be regulated with the help of forms.\nThe forms mentioned comprise some fundamental rules such as \u201call\nmetadata [and all software] is openly accessible\u201d and \u201cby default, all\narchived materials [...] are not openly available and access therefore will\nbe restricted\u201d (DOBES-DAPR) as well as the more detailed rules as to what\nthe conditions and procedures are for gaining access. It is noteworthy that\nat this layer, too, there are inbuilt tensions. For example, with regard to\nthe notion of shared property and access rights according to which the\ncopyright rests with both depositors and consultants (e.g. speakers), one\ncan easily imagine situations where among depositors, among consultants\nor between these groups there may be conflicting interests. The regulations\ncannot and will not solve this problem for all possible constellations because\nthese very much depend on what happens at the other layers (relations and\npractices, see below). At this point, the depositors are said to \u201calways have\nunrestricted access\u201d while the recorded persons have \u201ca right to access\u201d\n(DOBES-DAPR). In other words, the depositors have the privileged right\nof access for a maximum of three years and the privilege to formulate\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 12 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 13\nthe access rights. The consultants have the privilege to allow or veto any\ncommercial uses of the corpus material (a rule contained in the CoC).\nThese rights are usually already contained in the research agreement\nthat each DOBES project presented before research began. In the \u2260Akhoe\nHai\/\/om case, this is a contract with one of the local non-governmental\norganisations. The contract, originally a contract for the media, was adapted\nin a way that it states:\n1. Joint ownership held by the community of \u2260Akhoe Hai\/\/om\nspeakers, the individual consultants, and the authors (in resulting\npublications)\n2. The non-commercial nature of the project\n3. Reference to the DOBES Code of Conduct\n4. The fact that only openly accessible data will be collected\nNote that while these regulations clarify the different types of rights\nthat make up the whole bundle of rights that we cover under the term\n\u201cproperty\u201d, they often pre-suppose that the holders of these rights are\nclearly defined. This is the weak point in most regulations of this sort,\nsince the \u201ccommunity of speakers\u201d is a vague concept, at best, and an\noutright fictional \u201cbody\u201d, at worst. Community organisations are known\nto be highly flexible and prone to conflict, fission and faction fighting.\nProjects should be aware that \u201cthe creators\u201d or \u201cthe consultants\u201d are not\nthe same as the organisations with whom the contract has been made.\nAs the case may be, a project team may draw up contracts with different\nbodies (just as consultants may enter into a contract with more than one\nresearch team). In the \u2260Akhoe Hai\/\/om case, we have a contract with a\nnational NGO but we could have entered at the same time into contract\nwith the national archive or the national university, and we have tried\n(so far unsuccessfully) to have yet another contract by creating a local\nvoluntary interest group of people who have an interest in the corpus.\nIf there are conflicts between individuals and organisations (or among\norganisations), there is no way that any such a contract and its regulations\ncan prevent language documentation to be drawn into these conflicts. The\nbest that one can hope for is that, on the basis of the Code of Conduct,\nlanguage documentation does not create new conflicts, and that it does\nnot lend itself easily for one faction or interest group to dominate others.\nThe contracts or agreements should not create the illusion that with these\nregulations in place conflicts are eliminated. Rather, good contracts do not\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 13 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 14 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nconfuse the rights of all individuals concerned with the specific rights of\nthe representative groups mentioned in contracts. Although a contract is\ntypically a bilateral agreement (in terms of signatures), it can nevertheless\nbe written as a three-party agreement between researcher, counterpart\nand the speakers, thereby recognising the difference between individual\nconsultants and the organisations that claim to represent the community.\nIn all likelihood, some third party, be it future researchers or speakers,\nwill be affected by the agreements made. Even the so-called \u201cfinal access\nstatement\u201d (to be made at the end of funding) is not really final insofar as a\nreview of access rights is possible at regular intervals (every two years, see\nDOBES-DAA). This applies primarily to the distinction into three levels of\naccess (open, on request, not accessible). Passwords that allow access to\ndigital archives are given limited lifetimes (see DOBES-DAPR). Although\nthere is a general tendency in archiving for resources to open up as time\ngoes by (as the collection survives individuals, for instance), there is no\ncategorical reason why access should not also be tightened up after a while,\nfor instance if abuse has been occurring. Researchers and consultants could\ntake advantage of the fact that regulations can be created with some sort\nof inbuilt shelf life date by which past decisions have to be reconfirmed or\nrevised as a consequence of evolving social relations.\nSocial relations\nIt is important to recognise that some aspects relating to property issues\ncannot be covered with the help of regulations and forms (and in fact need\nnot, or are better not, covered using these forms). For instance, we need\nto recognise that many statements about property and access rights in\ndigital records of spoken languages are not necessarily about the relation\nbetween person or community and corpus. It may have much more to do\nwith the relationship between community and person (e.g. the researcher)\nor between communities (e.g. speakers of a neighbouring variant). In other\nwords, the lesson from the ethnography of property rights is that people\noften make property claims not because they necessarily want or need\nexclusive access to data, a particular recording for instance, but because they\nwant to shape their relationship with others. Property and access claims\nsignal to the rest of the world that local people want to be treated as equal,\nsovereign and autonomous in their decisions. These social aspirations are\nonly partly satisfied by the use of forms and regulations. More often they\nare appropriately recognised and satisfied when complemented by other,\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 14 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 15\nmore culturally sensitive modes of recognition. In its simplest form these\nare notes of recognition written by the researchers and covering not just\nthe community of speakers but also, for instance, government ministries\nthat provided research permits and any other stakeholder who has helped\nin the research. There are other means, some of which are already in use\nby language documentation projects. Publishing non-academic texts is\none such way that shapes social relations. They are not just spin-offs from\nwhat we actually do but they are directly implicated in the social relations\nof property rights, and therefore should be considered an integral part of\nany language documentation. Another means is the installation of regional\ndata servers which allow communities with restricted Internet access to\nuse the corpus locally and, at the same time, functions as an important step\nin appropriately locating due recognition.\nThe recognition of the social relations layer can be both a relief and a\nchallenge. It can be a relief in that it is open to creative ways of recognition\nbeyond the signing of contracts. In some contexts the cultural standing of\nsigned papers may be much lower than (or in any case complemented by),\nsay, the presence of researchers at relevant events and occasions or their\nengagement for the community of speakers in other ways, for instance in\ndealings with the media or other outside agencies. At the same time, it can\nalso be a challenge, in that it is simply not good enough to argue \u201cwe have\nsigned the appropriate papers\u201d and therefore assume that everything that\nneeds to be done has been done. Contracts defining property rights not\nonly define the relation between people and things (e.g. the corpus), but\nabove all relations between people and other people.\nDigital archives with Internet access face the additional practical\nproblem of restricting something once it is out in the public domain. It\nis quite possible to imagine a situation in which materials, despite\nbeing technically accessible, become factually impossible to use because\nthey would harm relationships. For instance, while researchers tend to\nassume that privacy rights decrease with time (as persons die), this may\nnot be universally true, as\u2014in many other contexts\u2014people do not want\nunrestricted viewing of images relating to deceased members of their\ncommunity. Even if copies of the images were already out in the open,\nit may be considered an impossibility to include them in displays or as\nexamples in publications. More generally, people who may have agreed\n(even with their signature) to have material on public display may change\ntheir mind as they begin to realise what the Internet is and what open access\nmay imply. Although they may not have any contractual (legal) basis for\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 15 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 16 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nenforcing restrictions, researchers will no doubt consider accommodating\nthese reservations in order to maintain a good working relationship.\nAt the same time, honouring the decision of a speaker is different from\nhonouring a decision made by a descendent of that speaker. In other words,\nthere is no automatism that would grant a descendent of any contributor to\nthe corpus the same rights as the contributor him- or herself held. They are\nin different positions to one another and with regard to the corpus. As access\nrights are handed on (possibly over generations), they may be subject to\nrevision. There have to be default procedures for regulating access in the long\nterm, but these have to be necessarily preliminary in the sense that they do\nnot exist independently of the social relationships that do change over time.\nSocial practice\nFinally, there is a layer of property relations which ultimately falls under the\nresponsibility of each researcher and which will vary not just between field\nsites, but also between researchers. Many researchers who have worked\nwith the same people for two decades have an informal agreement with\npeople in the field. The collaborators in the field, in turn, then have a fairly\ngood idea what the research is all about and are able to clearly signal when\nto switch off the camera or recorder if they want something to be off record.\nIn fact, many researchers who have reached these means of understanding\nand agreements, whether tacit or explicit, which argue that\u2014at the layer\nof practice\u2014these often work just as well or even better than any written\nform of consent. However, there are other places and other situations, for\ninstance with newcomers to the field or new people to be included as\ninformants, where these agreements do not suffice. The problem is that\nonly those who know the field and the people concerned will be able to\ntell and to decide on the appropriateness of formal regulations in actual\npractice.\nIt is important to note, however, that the practice layer of rights is of\nequal importance to all other layers. It is obviously not acceptable to use\nconsent forms when one has\u2014in practice\u2014got the signature through\nsubtle forms of cheating or bribery (giving of gifts) or through ignorance\n(not fully explaining its purpose). But then: who can fully guarantee that\nthe counterpart has fully understood the implications of a piece of spoken\nlanguage being included in a digital archive that is widely accessible?\nAre we, as researchers, able to see all future implications? Here it is\nhighly relevant to include in the metadata what the research practice was\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 16 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 1. The Archive Strikes Back 17\nlike. To some, this kind of narrative may seem chatty or not part of the\ndocumentation proper, but I would contend that it is. Somewhere in the\nmetadata, the future users of the archived materials should read not only\nabout the stimuli for elicitation or recording tools that were used, but\nalso a brief characterisation of how contact was established and what\nthe everyday research practice looked like. This kind of information will,\nno doubt, be highly valued when anyone in the future wants to put the\ndocumentation into perspective. It is ultimately down to the individuals\ninvolved to include (or not to include) certain items in the documentation.\nSince individual researchers differ in the ways in which they restrict access\nto a source that he or she has collected, it is important to clearly mark who\nmade decisions of access, and preferably also why.\nDigitisation and electronic archiving are themselves not neutral\nactivities, and there are a number of different ways in which researchers\n(and the researched) may want to integrate these activities into their own\nactions. The digital promise is that the language corpora will live on for\nmuch longer than if they were not digitised, and that they will continue to\ngrow and improve in the future. However, after some years of experience\nin digital archiving (reflected in this chapter), we need to realise that\ndigital archiving not only creates new problems, but also that some of\nthe old problems, of data access for instance, will continue. For one, we\ncannot guarantee that the practices that we put in place now will remain\nunchanged. If we did that, then the corpus would be basically dead, a body\nin the true sense of the word. The power of large-scale electronic collections,\nsuch as those we see growing at this moment in time, is that they go beyond\nthe single efforts and capacity of individual researchers. The downside of\nthis is that each researcher only has limited influence on the overall product\nover time. The regulatory powers are much more constrained than in a\ntraditional single-authored data collection such as a grammar, word list or\ncollection of texts.\nEvery discipline has its early adapters who embrace the new recording\ndevices while others attempt to cling to other formats that appear to be\nmore holistic, easier to manage and easier to adapt to local requirements.\nWhat I have suggested in this chapter is that researchers across the whole\nspectrum need to realise that the new technologies do not solve problems of\naccess or contextualisation, but rather shed a particularly sharp light onto\nthese problems, which can be a first necessary step towards addressing the\nissues at hand.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 17 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 18 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nThe new archiving effort is, to a considerable extent, being driven by\nthe new technology of documentation and of archiving. The archivists\nand the technical groups involved insist that regulating access to the\ndigital resources, as well as how to best organise these corpora, is not their\nresponsibility, but that it remains that of the researchers in close cooperation\nwith representatives of those who contributed to the data corpus. While\nthis initially promises a new and wider scope for providing and sharing\ndata with communities, it also creates some enduring problems for the\nresearchers involved. Archiving technology is indeed changing in some\nfundamental ways how we generate and share knowledge. The electronic\nonline archive is not a container that passively waits to be filled with data.\nRather, it also acts as a prompt and feeds back into the research process.\nIn this chapter, I have suggested that analysing this prompt in terms of\nparticular features of digital records and in terms of layers of property\nrights facilitates orientation when participating in this complex enterprise.\nReferences\nAppadurai, Arjun, ed., The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986).\nBarry, Brian, Culture and Equality: An Egalitarian Critique of Multiculturalism (London:\nPolity, 2001).\nBenda-Beckmann, Keebet and Franz von Benda-Beckmann, \u2018A Functional Analysis\nof Property Rights, with Special Reference to Indonesia\u2019 in Property Rights and\nEconomic Development, ed. by Toon van Meijl and Franz von Benda-Beckmann\n(London: Kegan Paul, 1999), pp. 15\u201356.\nHanks, William, Language and Communicative Practice (Boulder: Westview, 1996).\nWidlok, Thomas, \u2018Relational Properties: Understanding Ownership in the Namib\nDesert and Beyond\u2019, Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie, 126 (2001), 237\u2013268.\n\u2014, \u2018Property and Access Rights to the Corpus, Again\u2019, paper presented at the\nDOBES (Dokumentation bedrohter Sprachen) Workshop at the Max Planck Institute\nfor Psycholinguistics (12\u201313 June 2008).\n\u2014, \u2018Bringing Ethnography Home?

The discipline aims to develop \u201cmethods, tools,\nand theoretical underpinnings for compiling a representative and lasting\nmultipurpose record of a natural language\u201d (Gippert et al 2006: v). It weaves\nits focus on endangered languages together with traditional descriptive\nlinguistics and a strong emphasis on the use of media and information\ntechnologies. It also encourages ethical practices such as involving language\nspeakers as participants and beneficiaries (Grinevald 2003). Its central\nfeatures are:2\n1 The chapter focuses on access rather than usage, where usage is a cover term for several\ncrucial and complementary issues such as intellectual property, copyright, privacy, and\nvarious kinds of usage licences.

Its data should be available and\naccessible to a wide range of users\n\u2022 Involvement of the speech community: collaboration with community\nmembers not only as consultants but also as co-researchers\n\u2022 Archiving: materials should be preserved and made available to a\nrange of potential users into the distant future\nWe can identify the participants and stakeholders in documentation as\na prelude to considering what should be provided in terms of access.\nFirstly, there are the documenters themselves, typically linguists (and,\noccasionally, academics from other fields) who have received grants to\ndo various kinds of documentation projects, together with the others in\ntheir teams who perform the various activities associated with running\na project. Crucially, there are the language speakers and consultants,\ntheir families and communities. But not to be forgotten are the more\nperipheral stakeholders such as various institutions who host projects\n(typically universities) or are interested in evaluating the work or\nreputation of particular documenters, and governmental authorities\ninterested in language planning. Finally\u2014but most importantly\nwhen considering access issues\u2014there are many categories of users:\nlinguists and other researchers, teachers and applied linguists who\nare interested in resources for language revitalisation, heritage users\n(community members generally interested in resources related to their\nculture), journalists (who always want poignant stories about last\nspeakers), and, finally, curious people who are interested in all kinds\nof \u201cexotica\u201d.3\nTypically, however, archives in our field have provided a narrow,\none-way access strategy, enabling academic documenters to provide\nmaterials, and linguistic researchers to access them, as depicted in\nFigure 1 (Nathan and Fang 2009).\n3 S ee also Woodbury (2011: 162, 177).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 22 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 23\nFigure 1. Illustration of the narrow channel between documenters\n(providers) and linguists (users). Image by David Nathan, 2012.\nFrom documentation to archiving\nWhen policies and plans for the Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR)\nbegan to develop,4 in around 2004,5 documentary linguistics was not yet\na mature discipline and its archiving needs were unclear. Even today,\nmany of its basic parameters remain open to discovery rather than being\nfact or convention: \u201cdocumentary linguistics is new enough [so] [\u2026] that\nits scope, its scientific and humanistic goals, its stakeholders, participants\nand practices are still being explored and debated both inside and outside\nacademic contexts\u201d (Woodbury 2011: 171). We asked which aspects of\ndocumentation were both central to its practices and relevant to archiving\nand access. We were able to distil two such characteristics: diversity and\nprotocol.\nHimmelmann\u2019s seminal description of a language documentation as \u201ca\nmultipurpose [\u2026] record of the linguistic practices characteristic of a speech\ncommunity\u201d (1998: 166; emphasis David Nathan) depicts its methods and\noutputs as inherently heterogeneous. Such records cannot then conform to\na single template. Diversity is most clearly represented in the wide range\n4 The ELAR in London, and its online catalogue is one programme of the Hans Rausing\nEndangered Languages Project, based at the School of Oriental and African Studies.\nELAR\u2019s archiving activities are complemented by training, depositor support, outreach,\nand publishing.\n5 ELAR opened in 2005 and launched its new catalogue system in June 2010.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 23 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 24 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nof projects: ELDP\u2019s funded projects range from recording the \u201cwhistled\nlanguage\u201d of a tiny Amazonian community,6 to a documentation of a\nlanguage in China with thousands of speakers yet expected to decline\nquickly.7 Layered on project contexts are their specific goals; whether,\nfor example, they aim to describe particular linguistic phenomena, focus\non annotated recordings, apply ethnomusicological understandings to\nsongs, or create pedagogical resources for language revitalisation. Within\neach project, the cultures, communities and individuals with whom the\ndocumenter works all bring their unique skills, verbal styles, outlook,\nand motivations for participation. Documenters themselves are typically\nlone fieldworkers in remote locations (Austin 2005), so their practices are\nrelatively unharmonised. Finally, of course, languages and their usages\nvary in yet unknown ways: that is what our awareness of language\nendangerment and the urgency of documentation tell us, for in truth we\nknow relatively little about most of the world\u2019s 7,000 human languages.\nTurning to the forms of documentations, there are few clear conventions\nfor what actually counts as a language documentation (Himmelmann 2006:\n10; Woodbury 2011: 171, 184). We find them containing a wide range of\nmedia, text types, and data formats, for which there are few agreed or settled\nstandards; language data are not (yet) captured by an agreed framework of\nattributes. Compare this situation to that of libraries or businesses whose\ndata is anchored in concepts such as title, author, page, quantity, cost, and\nitem code all of which are well-established, stable, and correspond to\nreal-world objects, rather than the contestable interpretations of linguistics.\nIt is an open question as to whether a universal and stable set of concepts\nand categories will ever be formulated and agreed, although efforts are\nbeing made in that direction, e.g. GOLD Ontology, Leipzig Glossing Rules,\nand genre inventories (Johnson and Dwyer 2002).\nThe second key characteristic is protocol. ELAR uses this term as\nshorthand for the sum of processes involved in the formulation and\nimplementation of language speakers\u2019 rights and sensitivities, and the\nconsequent controlled access to materials. Protocol extends from the\nbeginning of any documentation activity (e.g. when a documenter seeks\ninformed consent from speakers, and then collects metadata on sensitivity\n6 See Online Sources for Julien Meyer\u2019s project on the Gaviao and Surui languages,\nDocumentation of Gaviao and Surui Languages in whistled and instrumental speech.\n7 See Online Sources for Ross Perlin\u2019s project on the Dulong language, Documentation\nand description of Dulong.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 24 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 25\nand access from them for each recording) through to the mechanisms\nfor providing, restricting, or negotiating about archived materials.\nTo understand the pervasive importance of protocol for language\ndocumentation, consider that endangered language communities and\ntheir speakers are typically under various pressures and deprivations\nthat are also contributing causes to the decline of their languages. These\ndifficulties are amplified by the methodology of documentary linguistics,\nwhich most highly values the recording of spontaneous, natural speech. As\nlanguages cease to be spoken in a wide range of contexts (which is what\nprimarily drives endangerment), people tend to use them more and more\nto speak of private, local, sensitive and secret matters. So the primary data\nof documentary linguistics maximises the likelihood of including content\nthat can cause embarrassment or harm to the recorded speakers.8\nA documentation archive\nArchiving is an integral part of language documentation, for it would be\npointless to document endangered languages without securing the safety\nand sustainability of the recorded data (Bird and Simons 2003). Today,\nseveral archives are devoted to endangered languages documentation.9\nMost of these are digital archives because documentation is inextricably\nlinked with digital technologies in four ways: digital recording has made\nportable, high quality recording affordable; long term preservation of audio\nand video is possible only through lossless digital copying (IASA 2005);\nmost researchers use computers to annotate media and create data and\nanalysis in general; and the World Wide Web has become the ubiquitous\nplatform for accessing documentation materials.\nA digital documentation archive has to be more than a data repository.\nIt has to find ways to preserve diverse materials and disseminate (or\npublish) them to a variety of stakeholders while safeguarding access where\nrequired. Most archives have collection policies (Conathan 2011: 240), some\nhave policies which describe the types of access offered10 or classes of users\n8 In addition, documenters, unless they are community members, are likely to know less\nabout sources of sensitivities\u2014and are therefore less able to avoid them\u2014than they\nmight in other research contexts.\n9 See Online Resources for a list on the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archive\nNetwork.\n10 For example Peter Wittenburg (2005) Data Access and Protection Rules DAPR-V2, see\nOnline Sources.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 25 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 26 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nwho they exist to serve,11 however few explicitly link the architecture of\ntheir access system with the characteristics of their users. ELAR has done\nthe latter by designing an archive with \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d (also known as \u201csocial\nnetworking\u201d) features:\n[A]rchive access management can be effectively served and enhanced by the\nnew [Web 2.0] technologies and the conventions that have quickly grown\nup around them. In Facebook [\u2026] account holders build and participate in\nvirtual communities by choosing who are to be their \u2018friends\u2019\u2014who are in\neffect the people who are permitted to see and interact with their presence\non the site. In the same way, ELAR provides a channel for users to find and\napproach depositors to request access to materials, and for depositors to\ndecide who will be their \u2018subscribers\u2019. Distinct roles of audience\/subscriber\nand author\/depositor are at the heart of ELAR\u2019s design. (Nathan 2010: 122)12\nIn this design, the archive is reconceived as a platform for building,\nmaintaining and conducting relationships between information providers\nand their users, just as many libraries see their mission as supporting\nlearning rather than lending books.13\nELAR aims to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by offering more equitable access\nto various types of users rather than privileging the single-channel provision\nto researchers. We can cater better for language-speaker community\nmembers in several ways. The first is through our implementation of a\nnuanced protocol system to manage access and provide security and\naccountability. In Figure 1, green arrows show the workflow through\na traditional archive; providers lodge their materials with the archive\nand users can (if permissions allow) find and access them. The archive\nfunctions as a searchable container for those materials. ELAR uses Web\n2.0 interactivity to provide a dynamic access process. Depositors can\nedit metadata for their collection at any time, including the metadata\nthat governs access. More importantly, the archive \u201cplays out\u201d protocol\nthroughout its interface (see Figures 3\u20136), always letting users know which\nresources they can and cannot access, and offering a method for individual\n11 See Online Sources for The Archive of the Indigenous Language of Latin America.\n12 Although Facebook is used here to exemplify social networking, the newly released\nGoogle+ better resembles ELAR\u2019s model because it distributes a user\u2019s friends into\n\u201ccircles\u201d just as an ELAR deposit provides various user roles; Facebook treats all a user\u2019s\nfriends as a single group, see Online Sources.\n13 See, e.g. Library Mission, Vission and Values, The University of Chicago Library (2004)\nin Online Sources.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 26 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 27\naccess to otherwise restricted resources through direct application to the\ndepositor (via \u201csubscription\u201d). A simplified representation of ELAR\u2019s\nsubscription process is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Illustration of dynamic access via \u201csubscription\u201d at ELAR. Image\nby David Nathan, 2012.\nURCS protocol roles\nBefore further outlining how ELAR\u2019s system works, I will describe its set of\nprotocol roles. The protocol system is based around four roles (U, R, C and\nS) that have been defined as a result of research into depositors\u2019 preferences\nand through consultation with groups of depositors and archivists (Nathan\n2010).\n\u2022 U = ordinary User (must have an ELAR account)\n\u2022 R = Researcher role\n\u2022 C = C ommunity member (protocol role) role (for a particular deposit\nonly)\n\u2022 S = Subscriber role (for a particular deposit or resource only)\nUsers are those people who have created an ELAR account. ELAR staff\ncheck account applications for bogus or scam attempts, but applications\nare in general automatically approved. Researcher role is available to\nrelevant practitioners, for example linguists or teachers; applications for\nResearcher role are evaluated by ELAR staff and if approved apply across\nall collections in the archive.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 27 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 28 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nCommunity member and Subscriber roles, however, are granted in\nrelation to particular collections, and these applications are evaluated\nby the relevant depositor (or the depositor\u2019s delegate). A Community\nmember is, as the name implies, someone recognised as a member of the\nlanguage-speaker community. This category can also be used to set up\nother community-oriented categories such as a family, a set of individuals,\nor any other group that a depositor and his\/her language consultants permit\nto access their data.14\nA Subscriber is anyone who has identified a resource, requested\npermission to access it, and had their request approved by the depositor\n(see Figures 5 and 6). When a user submits a subscription request, the\nrequest is queued in the depositor\u2019s collection management panel. The\ndepositor can see which item is being requested, together with information\nabout the user (information that the user entered when they first registered\nfor an account, including the user\u2019s identity, affiliation, and a statement\nabout involvement with endangered languages). For further information,\nsee ELAR\u2019s access protocol in ELAR\u2019s help system.15 Depositors can also\nuse the subscription system as a managed sharing mechanism (e.g. for\nlimiting access to a project team).\nThe subscription system is a significant breakthrough in terms of\nbroadening access to sensitive materials that in other archives would\nbe under closed access. Subscription applications are channels for\ncommunication between owners and potential users of resources: in other\nwords, users and depositors gain access to each other.\nHow protocol works\nAs users navigate the ELAR website, its management system matches the\nURCS values of the resources in focus with the URCS rights of the logged-in\nuser. Anyone can view a collection home page (see Figure 3), and see a\nresource\u2019s metadata, but only logged in account holders can access ELAR\nresources. Although requiring accounts limits wider access to ELAR\u2019s open\n(U) resources, we think this is a cost worth bearing. As described above,\n14 Currently, eligibility for access under Community member is decided by the depositor\nor depositor\u2019s delegate. We hope to develop a more flexible approach to managing this\nrole in the future. The AILLA archive, for example, has a system using special passwords\nas answers to questions that only eligible community members would know, see Online\nSources.\n15 See Online Sources.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 28 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 29\nthe subscription process supplies depositors with reliable information\nabout requesters, including validated identities and archive usage history.16\nWe do not support user anonymity; rather, we provide depositors with\ninformation about access of their collections. These components of a\nprotocol system help to build and maintain a high level of trust and\nconfidence on the part of depositors and their language consultants.\nFigure 3. Screenshot of ELAR home page for documentation of the language\nand lifestyle of the Galesh, Carina Jahani. Protocol labels and\ncontrols are circled. Image by ELAR\/David Nathan, 2012.\nAs can be seen from Figure 3, we made a bold commitment to make protocol\na prominent feature of the archive interface.17 It inverts the navigational\ndesign of other archives where one searches and navigates to a resource\n16 We are in the process of implementing some of these features.\n17 Various web projects by Kimberley Christen and research partners have focused on\ninterfaces for cultural protocols \u201cthat both limit and enhance the exchange, distribution\nand creation of knowledge\u201d. See Online Sources.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 29 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 30 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nof interest, only to be faced by a \u201cnot available\u201d message or a pop-up\ndemanding a log in to an unknown service; users do not discover that a\ngiven resource is closed until having completed a possibly complex search.\nIn such archives it can even be difficult for depositors themselves to know\nwhat access conditions currently hold for their own materials.\nHow does a user make use of ELAR\u2019s protocol information? Information\nat the top right of the collection\u2019s Home page (see Figure 3) provides an\noverview, showing the default access protocol for the collection, together\nwith the default access rights for the presently logged-in user. For\nperforming search\/navigation, controls are provided in the navigation\npanel. These also give more information. Figure 4 shows the user that\n37 resources are available (because \u201cU\u201d is outlined in solid green), while\nthree Subscriber-only resources are unavailable (indicated by the \u201cS\u201d in\ndotted red outline).\nFigure 4. Access protocol controls in the navigational panel in the ELAR\nwebsite. Image by ELAR\/David Nathan, 2012.\nUsers who only want to be shown resources for which they have access\nrights can thus search or browse by clicking on the appropriate protocol\ncategory. On the other hand, if a user browses all resources and reaches one\nwhich is Subscriber-only, he\/she is offered an option to \u201cApply for access\nrights\u201d, which, if clicked, triggers the subscription application process\ndescribed above.\nFigure 5. Display of a subscriber-only resource in the ELAR website. Image\nby ELAR\/David Nathan, 2012.\nAfter a subscription application is approved by the depositor, the user will\nsee the \u201cS\u201d icon outlined in green, as shown in Figure 6, where a (different)\nresource is available, in this case an audio file which can be either played\nor downloaded.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 30 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 31\nFigure 6. This user has subscription rights to this resource in the ELAR\nwebsite. Image by ELAR\/David Nathan, 2012.\nUsers of this system are always aware of their\naccess protocol context. They can choose to\nonly search for accessible items, or they can\nrequest access to items where necessary.\nAnd at any point, users know why they can or\ncannot access particular resources.\nSearching, browsing and\nmetadata\nSo far I have described the role of protocol\nin navigating ELAR\u2019s resources. ELAR also\nprovides search and browse functions. Its\nsearch is fairly standard, offering a stemmed\nsearch over all archive metadata.18 ELAR\nplaces higher priority on enabling users\nto browse. Browsing reflects the diversity\nof documentation; with its wide array of\nresources, formats, and metadata, users need\na way to find out what is available. Browsing\nprovides a user-friendly \u201croad map\u201d rather\nthan potential responses to specific queries.\nIt is implemented using a dynamic \u201cfaceted\nbrowse\u201d system, visible in the left hand panel\nin Figure 3; a detail for another collection\nappears in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. User-friendly discovery using faceted browsing in the ELAR\nwebsite. Image by ELAR\/David Nathan, 2012.\n18 Stemmed search means that terms are searched according to their uninflected forms; for\nexample, searching for \u201ccats\u201d will find all resources containing \u201ccat\u201d in their metadata\nand vice versa.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 31 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 32 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nThere are, of course, good arguments for providing search over\nstandardised metadata\u2014for example ISO 639 codes enable users to\naccurately find all resources for a certain language, despite the variety\nof names it might have.19 Such strategies have been the backbone of\ntraditional library and indexing practice. But it is important to remember\nthat while they serve certain classes of users and purposes very well,\nthey also diminish access to other users and purposes. Researchers, for\nexample, are likely to know\u2014or know how to find\u2014standard codes for\nlanguages. Searches via such codes yield high recall (returning most of\nthe relevant resources, not missing many) and high precision (returning\nrelevant resources, with few irrelevant ones). However, for many of the\nusers and purposes we wish to serve, query interfaces provide low recall\ndue to their \u201contological flatness\u201d (Christie 2005: 13).\nA non-researcher language community member, for example, is likely\nto get better results when looking for a story about a particular animal or\nplace if they can see the names of the animal or place displayed, and even\nbetter results if the colloquial or language term for that animal or place is\nshown (rather than, say, the scientific or official name). Depending on the\nlevel of literacy in a community, even the colloquial or language terms may\nnot normally be written, or may have variant spellings, so users are better\nsupported by being able to browse and select rather than being forced to\ntype in search strings.\nMetadata underlies these searching and browsing functions. ELAR\ntakes a permissive approach to metadata, encouraging each depositor to\nsupply as rich and descriptive a set as possible (Nathan 2011). ELAR also\nattempts to expose as much as possible of this metadata. Examples can be\nseen in Figures 3 and 7, where topics include butter, cheese, and pigs. In\nother cases, terms in local languages, such as Kastom,20 or phonetic terms\nand symbols appear.21\nELAR\u2019s approach \u201clevels the playing field\u201d in several ways. For\nexample, if depositors provide names of the speakers\/performers of\nrecordings, these can be displayed for browsing on the collection\u2019s home\n19 For example, Ethnologue lists 7,413 \u201cprimary\u201d language names, but these have over\n43,000 alternate (and dialect) names. However, many of theses names are exonyms\n(i.e. not the community\u2019s own term for their language).\n20 See Online Sources for Documentation of Mavea, Val\u00e9rie Gu\u00e9rin.\n21 See Online Sources for Somyev (Somb\u0259; KGT) Segmental and Tonal Contrasts, Bruce\nConnell.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 32 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 33\npage (see under \u201cParticipants\u201d in Figure 3). Speakers now appear right\n\u201cup front\u201d in the interface; their status is represented similarly to that of\nthe depositor. Community members\u2014or others with no connection to the\ndocumenter or linguistic goals\u2014can find and browse performances by\nthose speakers, without having to remember the name of a fieldworker\nwho once visited, the linguist\u2019s name for the project, or the ISO code for\ntheir language.\nAccess and accessibility\nELAR\u2019s approach to protocol, search, and browsing aims to enhance access,\nbut we have not yet asked the question: what counts as access? Searching\nand browsing, and file display or download, are not ends in themselves.\nUltimately, access has to take into account accessibility to the content of\ninterest to users. Different people want different things. Depending on\nusers\u2019 goals, and the content they desire, access could mean viewing\nmetadata, playing an audio or video in the browser, or downloading a file\nto play or manipulate it later (see Figure 8). Formal linguists might want\nto download interlinearised marked-up material; community members\nmight want to \u201cclick and play\u201d recordings of songs, stories, and events;\nlanguage planners or educationalists might want to assess the range and\nquality of the available resources.\nSome people mistakenly look to in-browser delivery as a strategy to\nprevent users receiving a digital copy of a file. This confuses access to\ncontent with the apparatus that delivers that content.22 Instead, we have\nto shift our focus from access to accessibility. Take, for example, someone\nwith little technical interest in their Internet-connected computer who\nwants to learn a song. A simple \u201cplay\u201d button will maximise the accessibility\nof the song. But someone who wants to acoustically analyse speech or\ntranscribe it in specialised software like ELAN will not be able to do so\nwithout downloading.23\n22 In these days of \u201calways on\u201d broadband, cloud computing, and a myriad of software\nfor capturing YouTube media, in-browser media players are not a bulwark against file\ndownload or copying.\n23 See Online Sources for The Language Archive: ELAN, Max Planck Institute for\nPsycholinguistics.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 33 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 34 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nFigure 8. Playing a video in the browser\u2014is this access?24 Screenshot from\nthe ELAR website. Image by ELAR\/David Nathan, 2012.\nProviding accessibility goes beyond allowing a choice between playing\nand downloading; suitable renditions of content might need to be made for\ndifferent audiences (Nathan 2006; Holton 2011). Not all users want, or can\nuse, audio or video with time aligned morphological annotation. Eli Timan\u2018s\nELAR collection includes time aligned morphological annotation,25 but it is\naccompanied by a community resource that forgoes most of the \u201clinguistic\u201d\ncontent, and provides what Eli, as a community member himself, knows\nthat they might use: transliteration in Arabic and translation into English,\ntogether with pictures drawn by the story teller.26 Another alternative we\nare working on is an in-browser video player (see Figure 9) that uses speech\nbubbles, a very conventional (and therefore accessible) method to present\nthe written content of a conversation.27\n24 From the collection Choguita Rar\u00e1muri description and documentation, Gabriela\nCaballero (see Online Sources).\n25 See Online Sources for Preservation of the Jewish Iraqi spoken language, Eli Timan.\n26 See Online Sources for these materials at Jews of Iraq.\n27 The speakers, conversing in Pite Saami, are Henning Rankvist (left) and Elsy Rankvist\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 34 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2.

Much of this paper has\nbeen about the nature of an archive\u2019s user interface; its design, layout,\ninteractivity, controls and navigation. While many of these factors are based\non underlying functional decisions, the overall effect\u2014often called \u201cthe user\nexperience\u201d\u2014is greater than the sum of such decisions.

ELAR prominently signposts protocol\nthroughout the website not only to guide users through the new interface,28\nbut also to embody a commitment to depositors\u2019 protocol choices.\nSometimes things play out in unpredictable but serendipitous ways.\nRecently a researcher described a West African community\u2019s responses to\nsome archive websites. The community has only recently been connected to\nthe Internet, and they mainly use sites such as Facebook, for social purposes.\nSo for them, a prototypical website looks and works like Facebook, and\nafter being shown a few online archives, they judged that ELAR was the\nonly \u201creal\u201d one.\nInterfaces can be misleading. For example, archives may give a false\nperception of access control. Some linguists believe that a particular\nlanguage archive does not allow downloading of files, although\ninvestigation revealed that it is quite possible to download from that archive.\nThe opacity of the archive\u2019s interface makes it so difficult to accomplish a\ndownload that they had concluded that it was impossible. This situation\ndisadvantages those who legitimately want to access materials and gives\na false sense of security to depositors who imagine a level of control that\ndoes not exist. In this case, perceptions have conflated difficulty of access\nwith control of access.\nInterfaces can also be subtle and unpredictable. Nariyo Kono\u2019s\ndocumentation of Kiksht (Warm Springs, Oregon, USA) contained sensitive\nmaterials,29 so they were deposited at ELAR under Subscriber-only\naccess, available only to the depositor and the small community team\nshe worked with. However, after the collection was accessioned and\nonline, and the community members saw themselves displayed, they felt\nuncomfortable and wrote urgently to ask us to \u201cturn off\u201d access. I replied,\nexplaining the benefits of them being able to see and check the site before\nallowing others to access it (or indeed to decide against access). However,\nI had misunderstood; the fact that they could see themselves appearing\nin the browser, on the screen\u2014in the place where normally only \u201cothers\u201d\nappear\u2014was disturbing. We negotiated time to allow further discussion\n28 ELAR\u2019s social-networking style interface is new to language archives, although it is\nborrowed heavily from the existing social networking genre (online resource discovery\nthrough querying standardised metadata).\n29 See Online Sources for Conversational Kiksht, Nariyo Kono.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 36 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 2. Access and Accessibility at ELAR 37\nback in Warm Springs, and after a month the go-ahead was given to re-open\nthe collection to community members only.30\nThe issue of access to archive resources is multifaceted, and goes far\nbeyond designating resources as open or closed. I have illustrated some of\nthe advantages of custom solutions for a specific field: here, endangered\nlanguages documentation. The central concept is a nuanced set of protocol\nvalues \u201cURCS\u201d, of which two describe a relation between an individual\nuser and a particular resource which is negotiated between the user and\ndepositor. We have not yet encountered a case where these roles and their\nassociated mechanisms did not provide an appropriate solution for the\nprotocol needs of a depositor or community. In fact, we have been surprised\nat the number of apparently complicated cases that can be handled by the\nflexibility of the Subscriber role.\nThe response from depositors to ELAR\u2019s access system has been\nunanimously positive. Some have elected to deposit materials with ELAR\nthat they would not deposit elsewhere, because our attention to protocol\nhas inspired their trust. Others have approached ELAR for archiving as\na result of searching for an archive with such a model for protocol and\naccountability. Some depositors who are preparing collections for deposit,\non realising that ELAR can directly provide resources to the communities\nthey work with, have reshaped their collections and revised their metadata\nto take advantage of the systems described here.\nThere is still much work to do. Depositors can edit the content of their\ncollection Home page (Figure 3) to add translations in the documented\nlanguage or a lingua franca,31 but we would also like to be able to present\nthe whole navigational interface in a variety of languages.32 With our small\nteam we do not have the resources to accomplish that, but some depositors\nhave already offered to help. It would be great to complete the social\nnetworking dynamic by allowing users to contribute comments, links and\nmaterials, and to collaborate with depositors, but all of these moves will\nrequire careful consideration of moderation and protection of moral rights\nand intellectual property.\n30 I am grateful to Nariyo Kono, Valerie Switzer, Radine Johnson, and Pam Cardenas\nfor sharing their views of this experience with me, and I apologise for any errors or\nremaining misunderstandings.\n31 For example, Shenkai Zhang has provided summary information in Chinese for her\nELAR deposit; see Online Sources for Pingjiang traditional love songs.\n32 AILLA, for example, enables users to toggle the entire interface between English and\nSpanish (see Online Sources).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 37 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 38 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nUntil now, access has more or less meant providing \u201cinsiders\u201d with\nthe means to locate specialist materials by using constrained ontologies.\nELAR has sought to help \u201coutsiders\u201d to access content they hope to find or\nperhaps never imagined finding. In doing so we are replacing a \u201cstork and\nbaby\u201d approach to archiving\u2014deposit and abandon\u2014with a platform for\nongoing relationships and activities around the data. This does require an\nincreased commitment on the part of depositors, but it will likely result in\nan enrichment of documentary linguistics and greater support for speakers\nof endangered languages.\nReferences\nAustin, Peter K., Training in Language Documentation: The SOAS Experience,\nunpublished paper presented at the Linguistics Society of America Conference\non Language Documentation: Theory, Practice, and Values (Harvard University,\n9\u201311 July 2005).\n\u2014, and Lenore Grenoble, \u2018Current Trends in Language Documentation\u2019, in Language\nDocumentation and Description, Vol 4. ed. by Peter Austin (London: SOAS, 2007),\npp. 12\u201325.\n\u2014, and Julia Sallabank, eds., The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011).\nBird, Steven and Gary Simons, \u2018Seven Dimensions of Portability for Language\nDocumentation and Description\u2019, Language, 79(3) (2003), 557\u2013582.\nBozarth, Jane, Social Media for Trainers: Techniques for Enhancing and Extending\nLearning (San Francisco: Wiley, 2010).\nChristie, Michael, Aboriginal Knowledge Traditions in Digital Environments,\n(unpublished paper Charles Darwin University, 2005) <http:\/\/www.cdu.edu.\nau\/centres\/ik\/pdf\/CHRISTIE_AJIEpaper.pdf> [Accessed 24 October 2012].\nConathan, Lisa, \u2018Archiving and Language Documentation\u2019, in The Cambridge\nHandbook of Endangered Languages, ed. by Peter K.

Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation:\nLinking an Ethnographic Archive\nof Endangered Oral Traditions to\nContemporary Contexts\nJudith Aston and Paul Matthews\nThe fieldwork recordings\nUnusually for an anthropologist of her generation, anthropologist Wendy\nJames has been consistent in her use of audiovisual media in her fieldwork.\nShe began this process in the mid-1960s, whilst working as a lecturer at\nthe University of Khartoum, initially using silent cine footage, reel-to-reel\naudio, black and white photographs and colour slides to record interviews\nand document her observations. On subsequent visits, she has recorded\non audio-cassettes, Hi-8 video and most recently taken photographs on a\nmobile phone.\nWhilst initially making recordings for research and teaching purposes,\nto act as aide memoires to her written analytical work and to enliven her\nlectures, over the years James has come to recognise the wider relevance and\nvalue of these recordings. This is linked to the way in which her role in the\nfield has been transformed. Initially, she went into the field as a participant\nobserver working on her doctoral thesis under the supervision of the\nanthropologist Evans-Pritchard. However, in the mid 1980s, widespread\nfighting broke out in the region and this led to her becoming a historical\nwitness of the effects of war and displacement on a marginal community.\nSubsequently, she has acted as a consultant for a television documentary\nDOI: 10.111647\/OBP.0032.04.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 41 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 42 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nas part of the Granada Television\u2019s \u201cDisappearing World\u201d series on war\n(MacDonald 1993), and became a humanitarian advocate and report writer\nfor various agencies working in the region.\nIn documenting aspects of James\u2019 intermittent fieldwork from the\nmid-1960s through to the present day, the recordings shed light on\nmajor world events in the latter half of the twentieth and early part of the\ntwenty-first century, from the perspective of an anthropologist who has\nbuilt a strong relationship over the years with her informants. These informants\ncome primarily from the Uduk-speaking people of the Sudan-Ethiopian\nborderlands. Over the years, James has made it her business to become\nhighly conversant in the language and has built friendships that go beyond\nthe standard remit of shorter-term anthropological fieldwork. One does not\nhave to spend long with her materials before this becomes apparent, with her\nwritten analyses also reflecting this deep engagement.\nWhilst these recordings are inevitably framed by James\u2019 research\ninterests as a professional anthropologist, they also offer insights into\na period of African history as seen from the perspective of a minority\npeople whose lives have been transformed by civil war and repeated\ndisplacements. Once living together in relatively stable rural hamlets, the\nUduk-speaking people are now dispersed across national borders, with\nsome living in countries as far afield as the USA. James\u2019 recordings reveal\nhow the survival of a vernacular language can help to create a powerful\nnetwork of overlapping memory and practice, through which old patterns\nand traditions can re-appear even in the most \u201cmodern\u201d of circumstances.\nLinking written analysis to fieldwork recordings\nIn her written ethnographies and associated papers about her fieldwork,\nJames recognises that the personal stories of the handful of people that\nshe knew well, and who helped her in her original research in the 1960s,\n\u201cweave in and out of the whole tragedy of the Sudanese civil war and the\ndeadly choreography of its entanglements with the struggles in Ethiopia\u201c\n(James 1999 [1988]: xi-xii). She has always tried to write about the events\nand changes that have occurred as far as possible through the words and\nexperiences of the people themselves and has expressed frustration that\n\u201cthe discussion of emotion, culture and language is greatly hampered by\nthe format of written ethnography alone, and even by the written version\nof the recorded and translated vernacular\u201d (James 1997: 124). It was this\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 42 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 43\nfrustration that led her into collaborating with Aston, and which led to\nthe creation of a website (Aston and James 2007) to complement her most\nrecent book on her fieldwork (James 2007). In the preface to this book, she\nwrites that the website is there to add \u201cemotional tone and a sense of the\ncharacter and personalities\u201d of people quoted in the book (ibid: xix).\nThe book is the third of a trilogy and looks at the recent history of\ndisplacement in the region from the year in which the Sudan Peoples\u2019\nLiberation Army (SPLA) was founded in 1983 up to the year of the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement between the Sudan government and\nthe SPLA of January 2005. Through the inclusion of personal testimony, it\nshows how the Uduk-speaking people, originally from the Blue Nile region\nbetween the \u201cnorth\u201d and the \u201csouth\u201d of the Sudan, have been caught up\nin and displaced by civil war. Whilst some responded to the situation by\ndefending their nation, others joined the armed resistance of the SPLA.\nMany found temporary security as international refugees in Ethiopia, whilst\nothers opted for resettlement further afield in countries such as the USA.\nThe book shows how the paths of those that have survived have converged\nand diverged in different places at different times, in such a way that there\nhas not been a permanent severing of ties or cultural belonging. It shows\nhow links have been maintained across borders and continents through\nmodern communications and where possible through the recreation in\nnew settings of traditional forms of storytelling, music and song.\nThe website contains a selection of songs, which are quoted in the\nbook, as well as some maps of the region and a series of photographs that\nchart the journey of displacement from the rural hamlets of the 1960s to a\nsemi-permanent refugee camp in Ethiopia by 1993. Its main component,\nhowever, is a series of thematically arranged video clips, which illustrate\nvarious kinds of instrumental music and dance referred to in the book and\nwhich give access to a number of interviews and conversations from the\nrefugee communities in 1993 and 2000. These engage the viewer in the\nsubjectivities of James\u2019 informants by showing their reflections on the past\nand their hopes for the future. The viewer can select to view a specific clip\nin the Uduk language alongside a summary in English of what is being\nsaid, with references to places in the book where James provides further\ncontext on the issues raised.\nAlthough the website does include some footage from the 1960s, its\nfocus is on the refugee situation prior to repatriation in 2007\u201308. Having\ncompleted this website, we are now planning a more ambitious project,\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 43 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 44 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nclosely linked to the creation of a digital archive of James\u2019 recordings. This\nproject is to create an online presentation, which incorporates a wider range\nof her materials and is organised according to the principles of thematic\nand temporal navigation. This presentation will enable users to follow\npre-authored pathways through the materials, whilst also allowing them\nto engage with materials in a more exploratory fashion. Whilst contextual\ncommentary will initially be provided by James, user communities will be\ninvited to respond to this commentary and to create their own additional\npathways. Provision will also be made for James\u2019 informants to contribute\ntheir own recordings to the presentation, as a means of extending the\nnarrative as they begin to document their own experiences.\nAdding contextual commentary to fieldwork\nrecordings\nHaving recently retired from departmental duties, James has now begun\nthe process of organising and preparing her fieldwork recordings for\nthe creation of a more complete digital archive. In the past, scholars of\nall kinds have deposited their materials in libraries or museums or left\nthem with family papers. The recordings have usually been separated\nfrom academic papers and notebooks, and there has been little provision\nfor still images, moving images and audio to be curated as a single\nentity. Digital technologies have, however, opened up a new set of\npossibilities through which a body of work can be kept together and\npreserved in its entirety. These technologies also offer the facility to link\nfieldwork recordings to contextual commentary through the creative use\nof metadata.\nMike O\u2019Hanlon, Jeremy Coote and their colleagues at the Pitt Rivers\nMuseum in Oxford have pioneered the creative online archiving of\nphotographs and items of material culture from the southern Sudan\nregion. The images are presented elegantly in contemporary modes of\ninformation design, and are an invaluable resource accessible to anyone\nwith computer facilities. The Museum is also sponsoring projects that bring\nold ethnographic films into view along with the contexts in which they\nwere taken\u2014see Alison-Louise Khan\u2019s Oxford Academy of Documentary\nFilm project, \u201cCaptured by Women\u201d. James\u2019 earliest cine footage from the\n1960s is already associated with that initiative\u2014as part of the larger project\nof creatively archiving her materials as a whole.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 44 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 45\nThere are some striking initiatives online today, which also offer\npossible models for our project. There is the Sudan Open Archive of the\nRift Valley Institute, for example (administered by Dan Large), focusing\nmainly on scarce or vulnerable written materials and the ephemeral\nliterature of the development agencies. Visual images at present are limited\nto those already embedded in text as illustrations. Very different in style\nis the substantial and culturally focused website \u201cMursi Online\u201d, built\naround the decades-long ethnographic work of David Turton among the\nMursi of south-west Ethiopia. Here we can see film clips, photos, textual\ndescriptions and analysis, with news of ongoing development issues; and\nas a real innovation, the site now includes contributions from two Mursi\nmen themselves, who visited Oxford and were able to undertake some\ntraining in making videos and maintaining the site.\nWhilst our project draws on aspects of all these models, it plans to go\nfurther by inviting users to enter a world with which they can empathise\ndespite its initial \u201cotherness\u201d. We aim to achieve this by focusing on the\nconversational nature of James\u2019 recordings, to create an organised selection\nof materials that draws on collections contained in the archive to present a\nworld of experiences. This world will be brought to life through sound and\nimagery with the fieldwork recordings speaking for themselves wherever\npossible. First and foremost we want the user to be able to engage directly\nwith these recordings and for the story of James\u2019 ongoing fieldwork to\nunfold through this process. In order to achieve this aim, we are exploring\ndifferent ways to provide contextual commentary on the recordings, to\ngive temporal and thematic coherence to the experience without locking\nthe user into overly didactic or linear forms of delivery.\nThis contextual commentary is based on short statements from James\nabout the nature of the conversations and activities documented in her\nrecordings, along with a series of longer reflections on her research and\nexperiences. By including this additional material within the archive,\nwe are building on Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s ideas about polyphony. Bakhtin\nproposed that Dostoevsky\u2019s novels did not combine a \u201cmultitude of\ncharacters and fates into a single objective world, illuminated by a single\nauthorial consciousness\u201d but into \u201ca plurality of consciousnesses with\nequal rights and each with its own world\u201d (Bakhtin 1984: 6). Such an\napproach allowed for different social styles to be presented through the\ncharacters, as opposed to there being an all-pervading style dictated by the\nauthor. At the same time it also recognised the personality of the author,\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 45 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 46 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nalong with social and historical context, as being an important source\nof interpretation and meaning. In presenting the story of the events and\nchanges that have occurred over the course of James\u2019 fieldwork as far as\npossible through the words and experiences of the people themselves,\nthe materials will be presented in such a way as to express tensions as\nwell as cohesion. In this sense, the point of view of the anthropologist\nas contextual narrator will not have final authority, with contradictory\nideas and different styles of speech being able to co-exist in a more\ndialogic form.\nMultiple windows and juxtaposition\nAs a means of avoiding overly didactic or linear forms of delivery, we are\nbuilding on Lev Manovich\u2019s ideas about spatial montage (Manovich 2001)\nby using multiple windows to enable different combinations of materials\nto be presented on screen at any one time. Manovich argues that the\ncomputer offers a new type of cultural interface based on the aesthetics of\nmultiple windows and graphical user interfaces. This aesthetic offers an\nopportunity to move away from \u201ca logic of replacement\u201d towards \u201ca logic\nof addition and co-existence in which images can co-exist simultaneously\u201d\n(ibid: 325). Unlike a book or a film, in which the structure is fixed and\npre-determined, computer-based systems can be multilayered and more\nopen-ended, enabling different pathways to be created and multiple\nperspectives to be explored. The key point here is for the contextual materials\nto be incorporated into the archive as separate data (whether it be text,\naudio or video), which can be placed alongside the fieldwork recordings as\nrequired without being edited in with the recordings themselves.\nWe are using multiple windows to present different combinations\nof materials to serve different purposes. For example, users might want\nto compare recordings across different time periods or they might want\nto explore a series of interlinked themes. Another possibility would\nbe to compare recordings of actual events with interview footage of\npeoples\u2019 memories of these events. The materials are based on various\ncombinations of observational recordings, interviews and informal\nconversations across audio, still and moving image formats. Flexibility\ncan be built into the system to enable users to focus on a single medium\nor to look at them together. This comparative approach will enable the\nrecordings to be viewed in relation to each other, to help emphasise\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 46 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 47\naspects of continuity and change across time, as well as multiple points of\nview across a range of themes. Our aim is for this approach to help avoid\nthe pitfalls of fossilisation, by making the system dynamic, reflexive and\nupdatable.\nThe reason why we are making a distinction between the archive as\na whole and the online presentation of an organised selection of James\u2019\nfieldwork recordings is closely linked to ethics. Whilst on the one hand we\nwant to provide access to the materials to as wide an audience as possible,\nthere are constraints that go against this imperative. Although James has\nfound that there is a strong desire amongst Uduk diaspora communities to\ngain access to her recordings, often this is something that they want to do\nin private, as the materials are politically sensitive. Some of the materials\ndocument conflict within and between communities, which is ongoing\nin a region where tensions persist. We therefore feel that it would not be\nappropriate to make the full range of the materials openly accessible as an\nonline resource at the current time. This is an important issue on which we\nhave begun to seek advice from related projects such as the World Oral\nLiterature Project and the Endangered Languages Project. One solution\nthat has been suggested is for us to consider using a password system to\nprovide different levels of user access to the online materials (cf. Nathan,\nthis volume).\nAston and James\u2019 strategy for the website was to focus on the less\nsensitive aspects of the recordings, showing the creative use of available\nmaterials such as plastic jerry cans to recreate musical traditions, and the\nimportance of song and storytelling as a means of keeping memories alive.\nThe organised selection of materials will extend this theme of resilience\nby enabling further engagement with the ways in which displaced people\nthrown together are able, or at least are trying, to turn their experiences into\nart, into fun with language, dramatic narratives, provocative enactments,\nwitty songs, resurgent dances, and music. At the very least, they will act as\na testimony to the Uduk-speaking peoples\u2019 awareness and self-knowledge\nof their predicament, to reveal how their deeply impassioned modes of\nunderstanding are based on conscious and ongoing reflection on their\nposition in the world.\nOur use of multiple windows is also integral to the principle of keeping\nthe materials open to alternative interpretations both from other scholars\nand from the people themselves. The work at the Pitt Rivers Museum\non their southern Sudan collection, for example, has led to one diaspora\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 47 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 48 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\ncommunity re-purposing the materials for its own objectives.1 These\ncommunities may be interested in downloading materials to incorporate\ninto their own websites or to keep as private documents, which trigger\nother memories. Keeping the digital archive as a separate, but linked,\nentity to the online presentation will open the recordings up to alternative\ninterpretations in the future. Additionally, by storing the contextual\ncommentary within the archive and keeping it separate from, but linked\nto, the actual recordings, the option is there for this commentary to be\nincluded in these alternative interpretations.\nFluid interfaces and the communication of discrete\npoints\nIn our paper for the World Oral Literature Project workshop on \u201cArchiving\nOrality and Connecting with Communities\u201d2 (Aston and Matthews 2010),\nwe presented work in progress as a means of illustrating our approach\nto developing the archive. Aston showed examples of her earlier work\nwith James around spatial montage and fluid interfaces, with Matthews\nreporting on how we are applying these ideas to the development of\nthe archive and associated online presentation.3 A selection of Aston\u2019s\nexamples is described below, followed by a more up-to-date summary of\nwhere we have got to in terms of scoping up our technical approach to the\ndevelopment of the archive and online presentation.\nThrough her work as a new media producer from the mid-1980s\nonwards and her subsequent role as a lecturer in new media production\nat the University of the West of England, Aston has developed her ideas\naround the potential of fluid interfaces and spatial montage to create\nnew possibilities for narrative exploration. In order to create a world of\nexperiences, with which people can empathise despite its initial \u201cotherness\u201d,\nAston has been pushing the boundaries of interface design to create flexible\nways of engaging with fieldwork recordings that are poetic as opposed\nto informational in approach. This builds on David MacDougall\u2019s point\n1 For example, an Anyuak group has copied material from the Pitt River\u2019s site and used it\nto create their own website (see Online Sources).\n2 Held in December 2010 at the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and\nHunanities (CRASSH; see Online Sources).\n3 T his presentation was recorded and has been made available as part of the workshop\ndocumentation on the University of Cambridge Streaming Media Service (see Online\nSources).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 48 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 49\nthat images that directly address the senses, such as photography and film,\nhave tended to be used within anthropological discourse as a product of\nlanguage or even a language in themselves (2006: 4). In challenging this\nconvention of making fieldwork recordings subservient to the scholarly\nrules of writing, Aston has been exploring ways in which the sensory nature\nof James\u2019 fieldwork recordings can be foregrounded to communicate\nspecific points.\nWorking with the authoring tool Macromedia Director and subsequently\nAdobe Flash, Aston has created a series of juxtapositions that explore the\napplication of her ideas across a range of James\u2019 fieldwork recordings.\nThese juxtapositions were designed to create a minimum amount of\nclutter on the screen and encourage the user to engage intuitively with\nthe materials. Although very similar in overall approach, there are subtle\ndifferences in the interaction techniques used, in order to explore a range\nof possibilities. Whilst early examples of this work have been provided\nelsewhere through online publication (Aston 2010), more examples are\nprovided here, to illustrate how they are feeding into the current phase of\ndevelopment.4 There are six examples in total, with the last two containing\nadditional contextual analysis in the form of audio narration provided by\nJames. All of these clips were recorded by James unless otherwise indicated.\nScreenshots from these six videos are presented below; please see Online\nSources for the web addresses of the full video clips.\nThe first example shows three video clips placed side by side, to illustrate\na point made in one of James\u2019 published papers about different ways in\nwhich the Uduk people remember traumatic events (James 1997). In the\nfirst of these clips, taken from the rushes of the Granada film (Macdonald\n1993), we see Martha Ahmed5 in a transit refugee camp at Karmi talking in\na very matter-of-fact way about the recent shooting of her sister\u2019s teenage\nson. This was a relatively recent incident and her report is very graphic. In\nthe second clip, from Bonga 1994, we see Peke Shigwami6 reflecting on the\ndisappearance of her daughter, who has been missing for several years. The\nanxiety that she is suffering is very evident in her interactions with James.\n4 Whilst the paper in the Forum of Qualitative Social Research (Aston 2010) provides\ninteractive examples authored in Flash, in the name of widening accessibility, we have\nattached video screen-casts of these examples to this chapter, via a series of online links.\n5 O ne of the key refugee women\u2019s leaders, who had some years of schooling before the\nwar. She has subsequently become a member of the Blue Nile state assembly.\n6 H er daughter married a rebel soldier in the first refugee camp. He took her off in a\ndifferent direction when people suddenly had to flee from a later camp.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 49 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 50 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nIn the third clip, also taken in Bonga 1994, we see Nathaniel Gurempa7\nusing storytelling to remind people of a moment of hysteria in which a\ngroup of Uduk had a vision of angels taking them back to their homeland.\nThis was an event that happened a while ago, which can now be recounted\nas a story, to the evident amusement of his audience.\nA fluid interface enables users to move between these clips at their\nown pace and in an intuitive way, to enable close investigation with the\nmaterials in ways that would not be possible within a sequentially-edited\nfilm. In addition to this, the different use of language across the three clips,\nalong with the layers of non-verbal communication contained within them,\ncreate a much richer description than could be achieved through words\nalone. The user can click to focus in on a single clip and view subtitles as\nMartha, Peke or Nathaniel speak. If the user goes back to the three clips\ninterface, the video carries on where he\/she left off, making the experience\nmore engaging than with more standard forms of a point and click interface.8\nFigure 1. Screenshot of \u201cThree Ways of Remembering\u201d. Image by Judith\nAston and Paul Matthews, 2012.\n7 Like Martha, he was educated at the old mission school and is a staunch member of the\nchurch community.\n8 Such approaches in which the video carries on where the user left off are rapidly\nbecoming more commonplace, as the use of online video grows in sophistication.\nA good example is the facility to move fluidly between small and full-screen video\non sites like YouTube, the difference here being in the employment of these interfaces\nwithin a multiple windows environment.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 50 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 51\nThe second example shows how a single clip, such as the one of Martha\ntalking about the shooting of her nephew, can be analysed in more\ndetail, by placing the written transcription alongside the clip. The user\ncan go to different sections of the clip by clicking on the corresponding\nsection of the written transcription. In so doing, a detailed analysis of the\nrelationship between the spoken word and the non-verbal communication\nthat surrounds it can be made, in a way that is unique to computer-based\nmultimedia interfaces. It was this potential to link written transcriptions to\nthe actual recording from which they are taken that first attracted James to\nworking with Aston and which has led to the current collaboration. From\nher earlier experience of acting as a consultant to the \u201cDisappearing World\u201d\nfilm on the Uduk (Macdonald 1993), James has written that \u201ca film can\nrecord the facial and body expression of listeners as well as speakers; and\nthe memory of \u2018fear\u2019 can be invoked even when it is not actually named by\nanybody\u201d (James 1997). However, her frustration with filmmaking is that\nclips such as this become embedded within the structure of a sequentially\nedited narrative, thus limiting the possibility for in-depth analysis of\nindividual recordings.\nFigure 2. Screenshot of a single clip analysis. Image by Judith Aston and\nPaul Matthews, 2012.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 51 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 52 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nIn the third example, the same clip of Martha is juxtaposed alongside a\nclip of the journey of displacement to which she is referring. This clip is of\na piece of footage recorded by a French news crew in a temporary refugee\ncamp in Itang 1990, in which Martha shows them the terrible conditions\nunder which her people are struggling to survive. The user can watch each\nof these clips in turn or move between them at will, focusing in on a single\nclip as appropriate. Whilst toggling between full-screen and small-screen\npresentation of video clips is now standard practice on the Internet, the\ndifference here is the facility provided for the simultaneous presentation\nof clips within a fluid interface environment. In this case, it enables\nrecollections of past experiences and events to be presented alongside\nactual footage of those experiences and events.\nFigure 3. Screenshot from video showing events and memories. Image by\nJudith Aston and Paul Matthews, 2012.\nMultiple windows can also be used to make visual resonances across\ntime, as seen in this next example in which cine recordings from village\nhamlets in the 1960s are compared with Hi-8 video recordings taken in the\nsemi-permanent refugee camp in Bonga, Ethiopia in 1994 and 2000. The\ncomparisons have been carefully selected to show how certain aspects of\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 52 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 53\nrural village life were being recreated in the camp, at a time of relative\nstability compared to the previous traumas of constant displacement.\nObservational footage of everyday activities, such as making coffee,\ndrinking beer, preparing grinding stones and playing music, are juxtaposed\nto show aspects of continuity and change across the two time periods. In\nthe interactive version, the user can move fluidly between looking at each\nclip individually or making comparisons across time through on-screen\njuxtaposition. This video demonstrator, however, focuses in on the\njuxtapositions as a more direct way of making the point through linear\nvideo.\nFigure 4. Screenshot of comparisons across time. Image by Judith Aston\nand Paul Matthews, 2012.\nThis next example juxtaposes three video clips also recorded in Bonga:\na mother and child preparing a grinding stone; two women working\ntogether; and a further clip of two groups of women performing the same\nactivity. The clips can be played simultaneously or one at a time, via a\nsimple keyboard command. Another keyboard command brings up an\naudio recording of James talking about the three clips and how the sound\nthat they are making is very evocative of village life in the 1960s. She\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 53 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 54 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nexplains how there is a playfulness to the rhythms and sounds that are\nbeing created that is rich in meaning and resonance, both for her and for\nthe Uduk people themselves. This audio narration can be turned on and\noff at will, always continuing where it left off, with the clips themselves\nconveying this sense of playfulness.\nFigure 5. Screenshot of evocative soundscapes. Image by Judith Aston and\nPaul Matthews, 2012.\nThe final example combines cine footage from the 1960s of the diviners\u2019\ndance with accompanying reel-to-reel audio. This material is then\njuxtaposed alongside video footage from the refugee camp, in which\nWilliam Danga9 produces from his hut a copy of The Listening Ebony\n(James 1999).10 A crowd soon gathers round as he starts to look at\nthe photographs inside it and to reminisce on the events that they\ndocument. The juxtaposition provides a very suggestive link between\npast images and sounds and their current value, as the pictures that\n9 One of James\u2019 old friends from the 1960s.\n10 James had given this book as a replacement for the one she had given years previously\nbut which had not survived the most recent journeys.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 54 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 55\nthey are looking at are also of the diviners\u2019 dance. This link is made\nexplicit via James\u2019 audio commentary, in which she explains that she\nwas deliberately aiming to capture the reflexivity of them looking at\nthese photographs, whilst she was making a video recording of them\ndoing this. The multimedia presentation adds yet another layer to this,\nopening up further possibilities for reflexive engagement with James\u2019\nfieldwork recordings.\nFigure 6. Screenshot of reflexive juxtaposition. Image by Judith Aston and\nPaul Matthews, 2012.\nIncorporating fluid interfaces into the current\nphase of development\nThe prior development of these demonstrator interfaces has inspired the\ntechnical approach that we have taken to the current phase of the project.\nIt has been our basis for looking at how the archive might be organised and\nhow metadata might enable this type of interaction more flexibly through\nthe interface. A key concern of our current work, therefore, is to establish\nworking methods that tackle the combined requirements of curation,\narchiving and the creation of exploratory interfaces.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 55 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 56 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nWe have found that James\u2019 recordings can be quite thoroughly described\nusing an organisation that encompasses the area of recording and the time\n(corresponding to research visits to the Sudan and to diaspora communities\nin the USA). Category and hierarchy need to then be divided and expanded\ninto broader themes, more detailed keywords and specific people and\nevents. One key requirement is to incorporate two kinds of semantics:\nthose relating to the primary content of the media, and those relating to\nthe subject of the conversation or focus of the activity portrayed. This is in\norder to extend our work around reflexive juxtaposition, such as an event\npaired with people talking about the same event. It will be necessary to\ndistinguish between these two types at times, whilst linking them at others.\nWe are working with a colleague at the Oxford Academy of\nDocumentary Film, who is helping James with the basic digitisation,\nlogging and cataloguing. Logging of video is being done with Final Cut\nPro, with clips then being imported together with audio and still images\ninto the desktop media asset management system Expression Media.\nThis enables metadata to be exported as XML and then transformed\nin order to structure the interface. Additional segmentation for video\nclips will be achieved using a tool such as Frameline47, with subclip\nmetadata exported to MPEG-7 and integrated. In terms of interface\ntechnologies, we appreciate that Adobe Flash remains a very useful\nfront-end technology for the manipulation and combination of media,\nand is widely supported. For this reason early prototypes were built\nusing Flash with dynamic loading of media and metadata files from\nXML. At the same time we are exploring the potential of HTML5 native\nvideo to support the kinds of interaction we have envisaged with a view\nto longer term sustainability.\nWe have also been encouraged by the work of the Pad.ma project, a\nstandards-based web platform for sharing ethnographic video accompanied\nby metadata and commentary. The Pad.ma tools let you look at video clips\nand scan through them, look at the whole object data and then go through\nto looking at timeline data. This is the type of interface that will allow the\nsharing and layering of metadata by different individuals over the web.\nHere we have applied these tools to the clip of Martha talking about her\nnephew to illustrate how it works.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 56 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 57\nFigure 7. Screenshot of Pad.ma prototype. Image by Judith Aston and\nPaul Matthews, 2012.\nAn outline architecture of the prototype system is shown below. The media\ncatalogue is exported as XML, which is then transformed into a simplified\nsubset of metadata as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This in turn is\nbrought into the web application where filtering and clustering can be\nachieved using JavaScript. Thumbnails initially represent the media objects,\nwhich are then enlarged when the user selects items of interest.\nFigure 8. Architecture of fluid data prototype. Image by Judith Aston and\nPaul Matthews, 2010.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 57 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 58 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nIn our HTML5 prototype, items may be selected according to theme and\nperiod\/place, then brought into a media browser, which presents two main\nvideos or images. A k-means cluster of resources according to metadata\n(with a set of binaries for each item reflecting inclusion or exclusion in a\nmetadata term) results in the ability to juxtapose resources on the same\ntheme by time and place. In this example, the selection of items within the\nmusic and dance theme collects two of James\u2019 slides from the 1960s taken\namong the neighbouring Gumuz people just inside Ethiopia. They show a\ngirl making music with holes in the ground at the start of the rainy season.\nThe slides are accompanied by sound and video narration to provide\nfurther context and an immersive experience.\nFigure 9. Screenshot of HTML5 prototype. Image by Judith Aston\nPaul Matthews, 2012.\nWe have begun incorporating narrative video fragments applied to specific\nrecordings and to comparative clusters, which are based on themes. The\nnext phase of work will seek to provide longer introductions to James\u2019\nintermittent engagement with the Uduk since the mid-1960s. These\nintroductions will reveal the changing nature of her fieldwork over time\nand introduce reflexivity into the presentation of her materials. With\nmetadata linking illustrative media to these longer narrations, the intention\nis to then provide a coherent guided trail through the material that the user\nmay choose to sample or follow at length. We have successfully piloted the\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 58 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 3. Multiple Audiences and Co-Curation 59\nrecording of narrative using a webcam while the collection is being viewed;\nthis approach can also be taken with other commentators.\nThis chapter has demonstrated our prototypes and working methods\nfor the development of an end-to-end system for the archiving and\nfuture exploration of an important ethnographic collection. As such, we\nare addressing the need for collections such as these to be humanised:\nfor additional layers of meaning to be applied. We have also shown\nhow metadata, carried through from the repository level, can be used to\nunderpin media montage at the interface, with potential for the discovery\nof spatial and temporal contrasts and resonances. In mapping Aston\u2019s\nideas around fluid interfaces and narrative exploration onto Matthew\u2019s\nknowledge of database systems and archive workflow processes, we are\naiming to immerse our users in a world of experiences, through which they\nwill gain insights into James\u2019 fieldwork and into the impact of civil war on\na marginal community.\nWe want this world of experiences to foreground the fact that many of\nJames\u2019 recordings are based on informal conversations at different historical\nperiods, between the anthropologist and her informants and amongst the\ninformants themselves. Through revealing the ongoing nature of these\nconversations and linking them to observational footage of everyday life\nand events, our aim is to remain true to the fluidity of oral tradition over\ntime and to avoid fossilisation. This is why we have begun to record James\u2019\nthoughts and memories, as evoked by her engaging with the prototypes\nthat we have been developing. In the same way that many of her recordings\nin the field are based on intermittent and ongoing conversations, we are\naiming for her commentary to have a similar feel and to be grounded in an\noral as opposed to literary tradition.\nWhile we are fully aware that this is an ambitious project and that\ncompromises will inevitably have to be made to create a coherent final\nproduct, we hope that its outcomes will go some way towards doing justice\nto James\u2019 work and to fostering empathy with the people whose memories,\nhopes and enthusiasms are conveyed within her recordings. We also hope\nthat this work will find resonance both within and beyond the academy, to\nincrease understanding around the predicament of a marginal community\nstruggling to make its way in the modern world. Finally, we hope that the\napproaches and suggestions offered here will provide inspiration to others\nworking in related areas, whether as academic fieldworkers, community\nactivists or interested bystanders.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 59 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 60 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nReferences\nAston, Judith, \u2018Spatial Montage and Multimedia Ethnography: Using Computers\nto Visualise Aspects of Migration and Social Division Among a Displaced\nCommunity\u2019, Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 11:2 (2010) <http:\/\/www.\nqualitative-research.net\/index.php\/fqs\/article\/view\/1479> [Accessed 24 October\n2012].\n\u2014, and Paul Matthews, \u2018Co-creation and Multiple Curation: Making an Archive\nRelevant to Contemporary Contexts\u2019, paper presented at the workshop\nArchiving Orality and Connecting with Communities, (Cambridge: World Oral\nLiterature Project, 2010) filmed and presented online: <http:\/\/sms.cam.ac.uk\/\nmedia\/1092085> [Accessed 24 October 2012].\nBakhtin, Mikhail, Problems of Dostoevsky\u2019s Poetics, ed. and trans. by Caryl Emerson\n(Manchester: University of Manchester Press, 1984) Orig.

Reflections on\nMultimedia Fieldwork in West Africa\nDaniela Merolla and Felix Ameka, in collaboration with\nKofi Dorvlo\nIn the beginning\nDaniela Merolla and Kofi Dorvlo started a video documentation project in\n2007 on Ewe migration stories and the festival in which these stories are\nre-enacted, Hogebetsotso. Oral sources and archaeological remains suggest\nthat a series of migrations started in the eleventh century and that Ewes\nsettled in Ghana in the early seventeenth century.1 Oral narratives called\nxotutu recount a flow of people from the town called Notsie (in central\nTogo) to Ghana. The departure from Notsie is enacted in the Hogebetsotso\nfestival (\u201cleaving Hogbe\u201d, i.e. leaving the ancestral land) that takes place\nin several Anlo towns in Ghana. Merolla and Dorvlo\u2019s project aimed to\ninvestigate what the festival contributes to the discourse of the migration\ntradition, whether there are other local versions recounted orally and\nwhat the present written\/oral\/new media interactions are.2 The project\n1 The contemporary Ewe settlements span from the bank of the Mono River at the Togo-\nBenin border to Ghana, where large Ewe communities live along the eastern side of\nthe Volta Lake, and in the area around Keta Lagoon on the seacoast (Amenumey 1997;\nGayibor and Aguigah 2005).\n2 T he performance is an artistic, cultural and social event that constructs meanings\nand networks including but also going beyond the uttered words. What gets lost in\nthe written transcription are the intonation and gestures along with the eventual\nDOI: 10.111647\/OBP.0032..05\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 65 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 66 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nalso envisaged collecting video materials of the Ewe migration stories\nduring the festival in the framework of the Verba Africana series.3 The\nHogbetsotso festival is usually held in the first week of November every\nyear. Merolla and Dorvlo had hoped to be participant observers and\ndocumenters during the 2007 festival. However, in that year and ever since,\nthe festival has not been held due to disputes surrounding the chieftaincy\nof the Anlo paramountcy.4 In November 2007, given the volatile situation\nin Anloga, Merolla and Dorvlo were not able to visit the area, instead we\ninterviewed Datey-Kumodzie5 who had been recommended to us as being\nwell informed about the Hogebetsotso festival and the migration stories. The\ninterview was different from what we had expected.\nAt the beginning of November 2009, Felix Ameka, Merolla and Dorvlo\nwere together in Accra, and watched and discussed the interview before\nmusical accompaniment, the interactions between performer and public, the clothing\nand scenography, and the context and politics of the performance (Barber 1997;\nCoulet Western 1975; Baumgardt and Bounfour 2000; Furniss 1996; G\u00f6r\u00f6g-Karady\n1981; Finnegan 1992; Okpewho 1992; Ricard and Veit-Wild 2005; Schipper 1990). The\nnecessity of new media in documentation and research is strengthened by the changing\nconditions of oral production in the last decade, for instance on the Internet (Merolla\n2002 and 2005). However, while video captures much more than text and sound, it also\nhas limitations with respect to some aspects of the context of performance: the smell, for\nexample. Moreover, the case presented in these pages shows that technology can effect\nchange in what is recorded.\n3 The Verba Africana series produces DVDs and CD-Roms for libraries and is freely\naccessible on the Internet (see Online Sources). It was started by Merolla thanks to\nthe collaboration between Leiden and Naples Universities in 2005. Verba Africana\nwas integrated into the international project \u201cAfrican Oral literatures, new media and\ntechnologies\u201d (coordinated by Merolla and Jan Jansen) supported by INALCO (Paris),\nSOAS (London), the Universities of Hamburg, Leiden, and Naples, the Netherlands\nOrganization for Scientific Research and since 2010 by the World Oral Literature Project\n(Cambridge, UK), the Language Centre of the University of Ghana (Accra, Ghana), the\nSchool of Languages of Rhodes University (South Africa), and the University of Bamako\n(Mali). For information on the project see Online Sources for the Leiden University site.\nThe series is open to all Africanist scholars. The idea underlying the Verba Africana\nseries is that textual content and visual performance are both essential for classification,\ndescription and interpretation of the oral genres and their narrative context. The\nperformance of African oral genres, whether classic poems, songs and tales or\ninnovative genres such as hip hop and AIDS theatre, is recorded and integrated to allow\nthe interested public to approach oral literary productions as total events distributed in\nseveral layers: video fragments and summaries on the menu, with the possibility to view\naccompanying material on subpages. Accompanying material includes background\ninformation, excerpts of studies and articles, interviews, transcription, translation,\npresentation and analysis of the context and of visual aspects of the performance.\n4 In February 2011, the dispute was resolved and a new Paramount Chief was installed. It\nis hoped that the celebrations will resume again in November 2011.\n5 Dr. Datey-Kumodzie does not use his first name (Samuel) in his recent publications.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 66 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 67\nDorvlo and Merolla went on fieldwork to the Anlo area. Merolla and\nDorvlo went to carry out their initial research project and made a series of\nrecordings and interviews at Anloga, the capital town of the Anlo area in\nGhana, and the centre of the Hogebetsotso festival. Among other aspects, they\ninvestigated what people thought of the stories and interpretations offered\nduring the first interview. In this case also, some of the answers differed\nfrom what we expected. We return to this point below when discussing the\nrelationship between personal and shared cultural knowledge.\nXotutu narratives and the making of the Hogbetsotso\nfestival\nThe Ewe exodus was probably caused by the progressive expansion of other\npopulations, most likely the Yoruba (Amenumey 1997: 15\u201316; Gayibor and\nAguigah 2005: 6\u20137). Several xotutu versions agree that the Ewe moved\nwestward from northern areas in present-day Benin and settled, following\nsuccessive displacements and subdivisions, in what is nowadays Togo\nand eastern Ghana. Through genealogies of royal characters, narratives\nof migrations collected at Tado (along the Mono River) relate that Adja\nand Ewe peoples came from Ketu in Yoruba country, while narratives\ncollected at Notsie recount another flow of migration from Tado to Notsie.\nThe most frequently narrated story includes the migration from Notsie to\nGhana during the reign of Agokoli I, a cruel king who asked the Ewes (then\ncalled Dogbos) to kill their elders, to build houses and the city wall with\nmud and pieces of glass, rock and thorns and to produce \u201ca rope out of\nclay\u201d. The Ewes were able to escape from Notsie thanks to a cunning trick:\nthey left the town walking backwards so that nobody could guess from\nthe direction of their footsteps that they were leaving. In such narratives,\nNotsie is presented as the Ewe ancestral home. Some versions collected\nin Anlo-Ewe include the episode of the conflict between Agokoli and Sri,\nchief of the Dogbos in Notsie, which fuelled Agokoli\u2019s harsh behaviour\ntowards the Dogbos\/Ewes. Other stories narrate incidents that took place\nafter the Ewe departed from Notsie, such as the episode relating how the\nright to alternate succession to the Anlo stool (symbol of ritual and political\nauthority) was established between the Bate clan and the Adzovia clan\n(Aduamah 1965: 5\u20136, 18\u201320).\nThe theme of inter-generational conflict, whether between king and\nelders or between father and son, is widely encountered in West African\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 67 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 68 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\noral narratives (Paulme 1976: 91\u2013121; G\u00f6r\u00f6g-Karady 1995). Similarly,\nthe motif of the \u201crope of clay\u201d is common in West African and Arabic\nnarratives (Gayibor 1984: 31; Pazzi 1973: 24). In the Notsie narrative such\nthemes are specified and localised. As indicated above, there is an episode\nin the narrative where the king Agokoli orders the elders to be killed.\nThis episode highlights the political conflict between kingship and amega\n(council of elders) in a system in which the spiritual and political leader\nwas usually secluded from public view and the council was the political\npower that communicated with the people.\nA young foolish Agokoli seeks to rid himself of the confining advice\nof his elders by ordering all to be executed. His Ewe subjects, however,\nare successful in saving a few from death [\u2026] And it is the elders who\nsuccessfully lead them [the Ewe] out of Notsie when they make their escape.\n(Greene 2002a: 1035)\nIf the solution offered in the Notsie narrative re-states the authority of\nthe elders, other stories offer a more ambiguous discourse on seniority.\nFor example, a version collected by Gayibor (1984: 27) recounts that one\nof the elders became drunk during a celebration and revealed the trick\nplayed by Ewe people to induce Agokoli to kill his own son; a revelation\nthat gave sway to the retaliation of Agokoli and the order to kill the\nelders. According to Sandra Greene, the theme of elderly authority gained\nparticular importance when social, political and economic changes during\ncolonialism jeopardised the social system based on seniority, \u201cResistance\nto this change in the authority culture of the area took a number of forms,\nbut perhaps the most interesting was the popularity of narratives that\nreinforced elderly authority\u201d (2002: 1034).\nAn intense interaction between oral and written xotutu versions has\ntaken place since the colonial period. According to Gayibor (1989) and\nGreene (2002a), the German missionaries who were active in the area since\n1847 promoted not only linguistic standardisation based on the Anlo-Ewe\nlanguage, but also the idea of a common origin of all Ewes from the city\nof Notsie. The xotutu versions identifying Notsie as the \u201coriginal home\u201d\nwere known in the Anlo area (present south-eastern Ghana) and became\ngenerally accepted since they were used for the reconstruction of Ewe\nmigratory displacements in the missionary school readers.6\n6 The Ghanaian priest Henry Kwakume offered one of the first full-length versions of the\nmigration story in French translation (1948).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 68 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4.

The Ewe (pre-independence) nationalist\nmovements referred to their common origin when they sought to include\nall Ewe-speaking peoples into one of the nations to be created after the end\nof European colonisation. An important moment for the diffusion of such\nviews was the rally organised at Notsie in 1956, on the occasion of the first\nAgbogbo (referring to Notsie\u2019s wall) festival, when the authorities\u2014reunited\nfrom all the Ewe-speaking areas\u2014decided to harmonise their historical\nnarratives.8 On the other hand, following Greene:\nThe Notsie narrative\u2019s popularity was further enhanced during the colonial\nperiod among the ordinary and the average in the religion as a result of local\nefforts to make sense of their own traditions in light of the Biblical narratives\nintroduced by the Bremen Mission. Instead of embracing the notion that\nthey were the children of Ham who had diverted from the path of God and\nwho needed the guiding hand of the missionaries to lead them back onto the\nroad of righteousness, many among the Ewe associated their exodus from\nNotsie with the Jews\u2019 escape from Egypt. The Ewes were not heathens but\nhad been one with the Israelites.9 (2002a: 1035\u201336)\n7 See, for example, the missionary school reader by Hartter, Spieth and Daeuble (1906).\n8 \u201cA cette occasion, tous les chefs r\u00e9unis confront\u00e8rent leurs traditions [ ] De l\u00e0 naquit\n\u00e9galement la tendance \u00e0 uniformisation des r\u00e9cits historiques des differents chefs en\nce qui concerne les phases de l\u2019histoire ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la dispersion de Notsie\u201d [On this\noccasion, all the assembled chiefs confronted their traditions [\u2026] From there was born\nthe trend to standardise the historical accounts of the various leaders concerning the\nhistory prior to the dispersion from Notsie] (Gayibor 1989: 212; translated by Merolla\nand Ameka).\n9 G reene mentions a number of authors who favoured this interpretation, such as\nMamattah (1979) and Fianu (1986).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 69 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 70 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nAll these narratives of migration, whether orally transmitted or written\ndown, give form to and convey knowledge of the Ewe land and community,\ncrystallising historical processes of identification through migrations,\nsettlements, interactions with, and interpretations by different groups. An\nexample is the re-enactment of the migration journey in the Hogbetsotso\nfestival.\nThe departure from Notsie is indeed enacted in the Hogbetsotso festival\nthat takes place in several Anlo-Ewe (A\u014bl\u0254 in Ewe orthography) towns\nsuch as Anloga, Anyako, Dzodze and Klikor in Ghana (Nukunya 1997: 106;\nAnyidoho 2005: 4). Hogbetsotso is a recent phenomenon, as it was created\nin the 1960s.10 At the beginning, storytelling was included as part of the\nfestival but in the 1980s the organisation chose for a dramatic form, as\nindicated by Greene:\nIn 1978 [\u2026] a clan elder who was widely respected for his knowledge of the\noral history of the area, presented a most dignified and moving account of\nNotsie\u2019s history and the exodus that mesmerized those who attended. The\naudience was sparse, however, and over the years it attracted even fewer\ninterested observers [\u2026] Refusing to abandon the very heart of the festival,\nthe organizers had opted by 1996 to pursue another approach. That year, they\ninvited a drama troupe from Accra to perform the exodus re-enactment. The\nresponse was overwhelming [\u2026]. Significantly, to attract such a crowd, the\ntroupe took considerable artistic license in dramatizing the events leading\nto the exodus. Agokoli was portrayed not as the insensitive tyrant of the\nwell-known Notsie narrative, but in slapstick form as a drunken, lecherous,\nbumbling ruler who was presented as more an object of amusement than\nabhorrence. The fact that only a more light-hearted account [\u2026] could draw\nsuch an engaged crowd illustrates the extent to which older meanings and\nmemories have undergone yet another set of transformations. (2002b: 27\u201328)\nThe power of the Ewe migration narratives as a means to negotiate and\ncreate identity is still perceptible in the present, as illustrated by the\nvideo interview discussed in this paper, integrating them in the eclectic\ncombination of different forms of knowledge in the contemporary\nglobalised world.\n10 I n 1962, Anlo developed what became an annual festival commemorating the\nexodus from Notsie. Named Hogbetsotsoza (from the Ewe words hogbe [homeland],\nunderstood to be Notsie; tsotso [exodus therefrom]; and za [festival], the organisers used\nthis particular title because Notsie (or Hogbe) was known to every Anlo who had either\nbeen taught or had heard about the history of the Ewes in school or from local traditions.\nIn the first year of its organisation and in all those festivals held since, however, emphasis\nwas placed not on a larger Ewe cultural identity, but rather on identifying and taking\npride in Anlo culture (Greene 2002b: 26).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 70 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 71\nThe interview with Datey-Kumodzie\nThe meeting started with a preliminary exchange on the aims and the\npublication of the interview. The interviewee explained at the beginning\nthat he obtained his doctorate in Germany on Ewe sacred songs and that\nindeed he was involved in and knowledgeable about the Hogebetsotso\nfestival and the migration stories as he was academically and personally\nengaged in the religious and philosophical Ewe world of cults and shrines.11\nWe asked the interviewee whether he knew what kind of Ewe migration\nstories were narrated orally and their role and meaning in the organisation\nand functioning of the Hogebetsotso festival. He made it clear that he was\nthe repository of a very special, secret knowledge that no other researcher\ncould reveal and that he was worried about \u201cpeople tapping and stealing\u201d\nhis knowledge. He then added that he needed to be careful because it was\nexplosive (\u201cvolatile\u201d) knowledge about the distorted history of the Ewes\nand how such distortions contributed to destroying the continent of Africa.\nHe told us that he had sent his book on this subject to UNESCO but they had\nrefused to publish it because \u201cthey became afraid\u201d. We confirmed that we\nwould publish the interview with his name and that the aim of our project\nwas to create materials for research and teaching that were to be distributed\nthrough university libraries. As at the beginning he had mentioned that\nthere was much more involved than the migration stories alone, we took\nhis hint and asked whether he would tell us about that too.\nAt this point he started to explain the meaning of the term Hogebetsotso,\nframing it in a cosmological geography of the Ewe areas of origin and their\npresent location that he presented as not generally known because people\nwould have forgotten the meaning of their language. He also described\nthe kind of dance that re-enacts the central episode of the migration story\n(the Ewe walking backward from Notsie), interpreting it in a metaphorical\nand philosophical way. Then he started to sing, using his song to link the\norigin of the Ewe to the creation of the world by the Mother Goddess.\nFrom this point on, with a powerful performance in terms of singing and\nnarrating style, he recounted that human beings had crept out of water\nafter centuries of evolution, \u201cthey were dolphins\u201d. The first migration\n11 Datey-Kumodzie is committed to the Hu-Yaweh cult that is related to the\nneo-traditionalist religious mission Afrikania (De Witte 2008: 135). He introduced\nhimself as the president of the Sophia Mission during the interview. Datey-Kumodzie\u2019s\ndissertation was defended in 1989.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 71 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 72 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nstarted from the Lost Continent of Mu from which the original Ewe\nspeakers spread to the whole world, to India and China, to Mesopotamia,\nto the ancient Greco-Roman world and Egypt. From Ethiopia, the ancient\nEwes migrated to Egypt and from there they went south towards Nigeria.\nFrom that point on, his narratives reconnected to the known oral migration\nstories of the Ewes. However, he added another wave of migration from\nwest to east from ancient Ghana down through present day Gonja, Ashanti\nand Ga territories before crossing the Volta eastwards to the Anlo area.\nHe claimed that this was the route his family had followed.12\nDuring his performance, he repeatedly used etymologies and linguistic\nconnections as evidence for his narrative. He had his story ready and well\ndeveloped, and we did not need to ask questions to go on. In fact, only a\nfew times did Merolla try to re-address the initial question on the role of\nthe migration narratives in the Hogebetsotso (and whether the songs he sang\nwere used during the Hogebetsotso) and he did return to it at the end of the\ninterview. As a whole, he executed an impressive performance, alternating\nbetween narrative and song.\nThe interview can be approached from myriad angles. As a performance,\nit was very rich in gestures, for example, the flowing movement\naccompanying the narration of the first human beings emerging from water.\nOverall, the connection of gestures to narrative style is extremely effective\nand beautiful. We will focus, however, on the content and its impact in\nrelation to the \u201cinvention of tradition\u201d argument and the interviewee\/\nresearcher relationship in terms of the transmission of knowledge and the\npossible influence of such narratives in society when diffused through\neducational channels, as it happened in previous times when missionaries\nspread their version of Ewe migration stories.\nAn attempt at interpretation\nAs explained, the expectation was to interview a scholar narrating and\nexplaining various versions of the Ewe migration story, the development of\nthe Hogebetsotso festival, and the interpretation of the narratives in symbolic\nand philosophical terms.\n12 If this is true, it would mean that his family are not \u201ctrue\u201d Anlo and that they might be\ncalled dzide\u00e9hl\u0254me \u201cborn into the clan\u201d.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 72 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 73\nContrary to expectations, the scholar\u2019s narrative appears to be a\nconvoluted mix of Ewe cosmological ideas, migration stories, scientific\nideas on evolution, historical knowledge of different periods and cultures,\nand popularising fictional narratives of the Lost Continent of Mu.\nMoreover, the interviewee\u2019s narrative was \u201cEwe-centric\u201d in so far as the\nlanguage spoken by the first human beings was Ewe and this language\nand cosmological knowledge fertilised and left traces in the best known\ncivilisations of the whole world.\nLet it be stated clearly that the problem with this interview is not\nin the mixing of heterogeneous materials or in its ethnocentricity. It\nis well known that narrative strategies and what is sometimes called\nthe mythopoetic approach make it possible for storytellers to integrate\ndifferent forms of knowledge from varied sources alongside input from\nthe audience and adapt them to present circumstances. The interviewee\u2019s\nnarrative can be read in line with the discussion on the constant process\nof identity formation and the making of tradition. Linking one\u2019s ancestors\nto major civilisations is a feature of the identity (re)construction and is a\nresponse as well to a variety of cultural predicaments, such as political\nand ideological discussions around nationalism and pan-Africanism,\nglobalising processes in knowledge building, and the need to find\/re-state\none\u2019s location in the mental geography and history that stretch to include\nthe whole world. We also see the linking of ancestors to major civilisations\nas a brave attempt to find a role for local knowledge\u2014but in a learned\nand esoteric elaboration\u2014that cannot just be put \u201caside\u201d because it risks\nbecoming ineffective and futile when segregated in the realm of mythology\nor philosophy.\nQuestions and problems\nIn making the Verba Africana volume on Ewe migration narratives it was\ndecided to include only the less controversial parts of the interview, and\npresent them as video fragments. Problematic parts of the interview are,\nhowever, presented in written form accompanying the video. As indicated\nbefore, although the problems connected to the selection are linked to\nthe characteristics of the Verba Africana series that address researchers\nas well as students and the interested public, our experience is connected\nto the discussion on the theory and methodology of video fieldwork and\ndocumentation.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 73 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 74 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nThe first issue encountered was that the interviewee is and presents\nhimself as a researcher, and his position urges us to consider the scientific\nvalue of his narrative and whether he is in search of legitimisation, as the\ninitial story of UNESCO\u2019s refusal to publish his book seems to suggest.\nThe ethical and scientific knot is that we intend to publish a video\ninterview that respects the original discourse of the interviewee but at the\nsame time we do not want to be incorporated into his personal agenda by\nendorsing his complex narrative as scientific, nor do we intend to publicise\nhis agenda or spread it as history among Ewe, Ghanaian and international\nstudents and among Ewe people. We wish to avoid falling into the same\ntrap that missionary discourses, through their teaching and preaching, have\ngenerated among the Ewe. Last but not least, we are confronted with the\ninterviewee\u2019s role and ambition in present day Ghanaian and Ewe society.\nHe presents himself as a pillar, leader and mover of a \u201cSophia movement\u201d13\nthat seeks to revitalise local religious knowledge and to make it accessible\nfor a larger audience; possibly as a viable alternative to Christianity and\nIslam.14\nOur scientific problems\nEtymologies\nIn the interview, etymologies are offered as evidence to sustain an\nelaborate narrative that mingles mythological creation stories, \u201cscientific\u201d\nevolutionism, popularising narratives and historical knowledge. The\nnarrator claims that the word \u201camoeba\u201d is the Ewe expression hamueba\nwhich the Mother Goddess uttered when she saw human beings emerge\nfrom water, and links this to the beginning of life. There is a resemblance\n13 A religious association related to the neo-traditionalist mission Afrikania that was\nestablished in Ghana in 1982 by the former Catholic priest Kwabena Damuah. Damuah\nintended to make traditional religion \u201crelevant to our times\u201d by revitalising and\nup-dating it, and giving it national and pan-African dimensions (De Witte 2008: 135, 231).\nOther organisations that strengthen local indigenous forms of religion are for example\nthe Asomdwee Fie, Shrine of the Abosom and Nsamanfo International (AFSANI) led\nby Nana Akua Kyerewaa Opokuwaa, and the SANKORE Foundation directed by Faiza\nIbrahim Taimako (see Online Sources for AFSANI and SANKORE websites). Together\nwith other similar organisations, these foundations join national and international\ngroups such as the Ghana Psychic and Traditional Healers Association and the National\nAssociation of Certified Natural Health Professionals.\n14 Note that \u201clocal knowledge\u201d in Datey-Kumodzie (2006), and \u201cmodern\u201d mythical\nnarrative means pre\/other than Christian\/Islamic religions and European\/Arabic\nphilosophies and science.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 74 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 75\nbut there is no semantic connection to serve as a basis for asserting an\netymological link. Similarly, he claims that the term hogbe which the Ewes\nuse to refer to Amedz\u0254\u0192e \u201cthe place where humans originated\u201d is related to\ntwo present day geographical areas in Eweland: the Ho area and what he\ncalls the Gbe area. The unfortunate thing is that the group which he refers\nto as the Gbe are actually called the Gbi and there is no linguistic reason\nthat could explain the modification from \u201ce\u201d into \u201ci\u201d. Elsewhere he links\nthe name Khartoum to an Ewe expression that seemingly sounds like it.\nIn the same way he claims that the Ewes were in Egypt and that Greek\nphilosophy and Roman thought\u2014as well as Catholicism and Buddhism\u2014\nwere all influenced and in fact were off-shoots of Ewe civilisation, and he\nbuttresses this point with some spurious etymologies.\nHistory\nThe hypothetical reconstruction of world history and Ewe migrations is his\npersonal narrative. It is problematic if understood as \u201chistory\u201d in the sense\nof the academic discipline, as a reconstruction on the basis of historiographic\nmethods. The interviewee refers to accepted \u201chistorical facts\u201d as bricks\nof his construction and as evidence to give legitimacy to his narration.\nThe problem is that he uses these facts freely and not in the historical or\narchaeological frames to which they belong. Not only is chronology mixed\nup at times, but there is also the integration of the Lost Continent of Mu\nin global history. It is worth recollecting that the Lost Continent of Mu\nwas theorised by Augustus Le Plongeon (1896) and James Churchward\n(1926, 1931). They claimed the existence of an ancient continent which\ndisappeared in the Atlantic Ocean. Today archaeological, linguistic and\ngenetic evidence has lead scholars to dismiss such a hypothesis and to see\nit as a fictional narrative.15 Similarly, the idea that the Ewes together with\nthe Akan, Ashanti and Ga would have migrated from Ethiopia to Egypt in\nancient times is in the field of speculation if not fiction. The migration of\nthe Ewes from East Africa and Ethiopia specifically, is also a controversial\nhypothesis that has been refuted by recent research.16\n15 See Fagan (2006: 23\u201346).\n16 \u201cSome students of Ewe history have tried to push this supposed point of departure\n[Ketu\/Benin] back to Belebele which is in turn identified with the \u2018Babel\u2019 of the Bible.\nOthers have suggested Mesopotamia, Egypt etc., as the point of origin of the Ewes.\nThere is, however, no scientific basis for all these claims\u201d (Amenumey 1997: 14).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 75 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 76 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nProblematic positions of researchers\nThe problems encounterd raise several issues for research, some of\nwhich go beyond the immediate concerns of authorship. One of the\nissues is that of \u201cinsider\u201d and \u201coutsider\u201d researchers, but it transcends\nthat. Merolla is evidently an outsider, but we are also confronted with\ndifferent kinds of insiders. The interviewee is an insider who is now\nboth a researcher and a researched, Dorvlo is an insider (as an Anlo)\nbut a researcher, while Ameka is an Ewe insider but an Anlo outsider\n(as a researcher). Moreover, all the participants in the current discourse\nabout the interview belong to the academic world and in this regard they\nare \u201coutsiders\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis Ewe local religious knowledge and migration\nnarratives, although (again) they are differently located: Merolla, Ameka\nand Dorvlo work in the academy, while the interviewee belongs to it as a\nPhD holder and an independent researcher, but he has not been an active\nacademic for many years now.\nWatching the interview over and over again reminds us of the\nobservations the Ghanaian anthropologist Owusu made some decades ago\nabout early African ethnographies, \u201cfrequently, it is not clear whether the\naccounts so brilliantly presented are about native realities at all or whether\nthey are about informants, about scientific models and imaginative\nspeculations or about the anthropologists themselves and their fantasies\u201d\n(1978: 312).\nAs a native speaker scholar, Ameka cannot help but think that the\nnarrative is full of the \u201cimaginative speculations\u201d and \u201cfantasies\u201d of the\ninterviewee rather than \u201cnative realities\u201d. Ameka is also confronted with\nthe fact that should his name be associated with this story, it would give it a\ncertain legitimacy, while the evidentiary bases of most of the interviewee\u2019s\nclaims are often blatantly false, and many lay native speakers can show this\nto be the case.\nMerolla is troubled by the clash between the interviewee\u2019s attempt\nto legitimise his narrative (through etymological evidence, historical\nreconstruction, and the interview itself) and the researchers\u2019 knowledge\nand standards required to distinguish academic discourse from such a\nhybrid mixing of creation myths, popularising narratives and scientific\/\nhistorical knowledge. By selecting the video fragments according to our\ndiscourse, \u201care we simply positivist?\u201d she asks, and unable to give room to\ndifference and alternative cultural constructions?\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 76 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 77\nBoth Ameka and Merolla agree that the interview has to be studied and\npresented as a piece of narrative performance. It is a narrative performance\nin which the mythopoetic approach deploys itself, but it also appears as\na personal mythopoetics built with elements from local\u2014either shared or\nsecret\u2014knowledge. The problem with it is that it has to be understood\nin the context of a suspended world, as in another world, although the\ninterviewee does not present it as such. If it were presented as a gli, a\nfolktale, belonging to a make-believe world, it would have a different\nstatus. But it is presented as real\/scientific, as knowledge that has to be\nbelieved as being truthful and that contends with scientific knowledge\nfor defining and understanding the field of reality. This is the reason\nwhy we need to present it in a cautious way when we produce a video\ndocumentation intended not only for scholars but also for students and a\nlarge public.\nEthical problems\nThe ethical problem is directly linked to what has been discussed before.\nWe intend to respect our interviewee\u2019s discourse, but cannot propose\nhis narrative as such. Not only can we not propose it integrally without\nenclosing it in comments on the scientific problems mentioned above, but\nwe also cannot avoid selecting the video fragments very carefully, because\nwe offer this as material for students and a large audience who may not yet\nhave the training and the critical stance to interpret this video narrative as\na making of tradition.\nThe selection of the fragment involves another ethical problem as well.\nAs a construction of the researchers\u2019 perspective and discourse, it expresses\nthe unbalanced power relationship between the interviewers and the\ninterviewee, given the respective positions in the interview, in academia,\nand in the present chapter too.\nPersonal or shared cultural knowledge?\nThe last point to discuss is whether the interviewee expresses his personal\nreinterpretation or if it is somehow shared, maybe secret, knowledge\namong a certain milieu of Ewes. It is evident that his narrative and style\nis his own. However, interviews conducted in November 2009 in Anloga,\ntraditionally the ritual and political capital of the Anlo-Ewe in Ghana, with\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 77 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 78 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nsome educated Ewes (teachers and office workers) show that the idea\nthat Ewes migrated from Ethiopia to Egypt before reaching West Africa\nis well-known and it is often presented as historical fact. Although there\nis little archaeological or linguistic evidence for it, as indicated above, in\nthe diffusion of such an idea we might see the influence of a schoolbook\nsuch as Eve K\u0254nuwo, \u201cEwe Customs\u201d, in which the author S. J. Obianim\ndiscusses such an origin as a possibility.\nAs can be seen in the quotes below, in the introduction to Eve K\u0254nuwo,\nfirst published in 1953 with a second edition in 1956, reissued in 1990,\nObianim notes that black Africans originate from Sudan near Egypt and\nthe Abyssinian highlands.17 Perhaps the Ewes, who are also a part of the\nblack race may have stayed in a part of this land [\u2026] (Obianim 1990: 2).\nObianim then suggests that the Ewes may also have partaken in the\ngreat civilisations of the Egyptians:\nPerhaps the Ewes learnt some things from them, such as pottery,\nblacksmithing and different kinds of other crafts. Maybe in the area of\ncustoms too, they may have observed how the Pharaoh reigned and how\nhis subjects showed respect to him. [\u2026] Because of the troubles caused by\nenemy or hostile people [such as slave traders] all the groups\/nations who\nused to be in Sudan near Egypt and the Abyssinian region migrated from\nthere, and there were only few left. Some of the ones who migrated headed\neast, and others went west.\nThe Ewes also headed west. After the fall of the Egyptian kingdom, the\nGhana Empire rose in its place with its capital at Walata near Timbuktu.\nThe Ewes were also part of this empire and they got some customs from\nthere also. There is no literature confirming this but there are some signs in\nour language and practices which show that our ancestors knew something\nabout this kingdom [\u2026]. (Ibid.: 2)\nAfter the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire came in its place and the Songhai\nEmpire also destroyed it: It is clear that the Ewes were also in the Empire.\nThe word for lion in Ewe is dzata. It is clear that we gave the name of Mari\nDzata to this fierce animal [\u2026] (Obianim 1990: 2\u20133).18\n17 The quotes are translated by Ameka. It is probably worth noting that the author\nObianim comes from Avatime, a mission post of the Bremen mission. Incidentally, the\nAvatime speak a language called Siya, or Sideme by the Avatimes, which is not mutually\nintelligible with Ewe. But because of contact with Ewes and also because of the mission\nschools, almost all Avatime are bilingual at least in Avatime and Ewe. Part of Obianim\u2019s\nknowledge therefore comes from the schooling he received and probably also from the\nBlack renaissance movement and the influential ideas of Cheikh Anta Diop.\n18 Mari Dzata is probably for \u201cMari Djata\u201d, one of the names of the hero of the Malian epos\nSunjata.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 78 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 79\nWhen this kingdom also fell, all the inhabitants dispersed:\nThus the Ewes also set off northwest until they reached Dahome (now Benin).\nHere the Ewes divided into two big groups: one part went northeastwards\nto the Adele region on Dogbo land. The important groups\/states that were in\nthis group are the Anlos, the Be, the Agu and the Fon, but the Fon migrated\nagain eastwards into Dahome and established the Fon state. The second\nbig group went southwestwards and divided into two groups: one group\nstayed in Tado and the other group settled in Notsie. (Ibid.: 1\u20133)\nThe influence of schoolbooks is far reaching and goes beyond national\nboundaries and generation shift. For example, the reconstruction of human\nhistory in terms of Ewe worldwide migrations is shared by Togolese Ewes\nwho produced a video summarising the creation and migration narrative\nof the Ewe, similar to the narrative offered in the interview presented here.\nSuch a video was aired on the Supreme Master Television (28 July 2007)\nthat broadcasts the teachings and actions of their spiritual leader Ching\nHai.19 The video found its way onto the World Wide Web (Figure 1).20\nAlthough the aim of the Ewe creation and migration story aired on\nthe Supreme Master Television is unclear, the video appears to assert the\ncentrality of Ewe cosmology and religious\/philosophical knowledge in\nhuman global history. As in a paper by the interviewee (Datey-Kumodzie\n2006), the Ewe\/African local knowledge foundation is seen as being central\nto new technical and spiritual developments in Africa. One wonders whether\nthey do not have the same agenda and whether Dr. Datey-Kumodzie\u2019s\nwork was the source of the video.21\n19 The Vietnamese spiritual woman leader Ching Hai developed her meditation method\nand esoteric knowledge in the 1980s. She appears to have learnt her spiritual path from\nThakar Singh, who had the role of Guru at Sawan Asham in Delhi in the late 1970s.\nChing Hai founded the Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association (with\nheadquarters in Taiwan), a corporate entity that has a media empire as well as restaurants\nand a fashion business worldwide. The Association also undertakes charitable activities.\nThe Association and Ching Hai\u2014as painter and fashion designer\u2014have a million\ndollar business, but the source of the wealth is unclear according to researcher Patricia\nM. Thornton. Thornton (2003) writes that the Supreme Master Ching Hai International\nAssociation relies on the Internet for self-promotion, recruitment and donation, and it\ncan be seen as a transnational \u201ccybersect\u201d.\n20 See Online Sources for the YouTube clip Abibitumi Kasa website forum.\n21 Recent fieldwork shows that the ideas expressed in the YouTube video and by Dr. Datey-\nKumodzie find wide resonance in lectures offered at high schools at Anloga town in the\nEwe region (Dorvlo and Merolla\u2018s personal observation).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 79 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 80 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nFigure 1.

Such a\ndiscussion is indeed urgent when we use video recordings, as in the case\npresented here, because new technologies are not only tools for recording\nevents but also tools that affect and change what is recorded (Gee and\nHayes 2011).\n22 See Online Sources for the Abibitumi Kasa website.\n23 We would like to thank Jan Jansen, Leiden University for this formulation.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 80 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 81\nOn giving voice\nScholars know that the use of video cameras may affect the performance\nand the context in which they operate. Moreover, the apparent objectivity\nof video images risks obfuscating perspectives, aims, audiences, and\nselection processes conveyed by the images. This is quite a confusing and\nparadoxical situation as we are somehow required to deconstruct our\nresearch and video recordings before we have even constructed them.\nTo summarise our progress so far, we may recollect some effects of\nthe literary analysis of narrative strategies applied to \u201cscientific\u201d writings\nat the beginning of the 1990s. Anthropologists and historians have used\nthe analysis of perspective and narrative voice very effectively to criticise\nthe way in which classic ethnographies and works of history construct\ndominant discourses under the guise of objectivity. Anthropologists\nin particular recognised that informants\u2019 voices were subsumed by the\nresearcher\u2019s dominant discourse not only in colonial work but also in the\nrecent and most well-intended ethnographies (Appadurai 1991; Aug\u00e9 1994;\nCliffords and Marcus 1986; Crapanzano 1980; Fabian 1983; Geertz 1973 and\n1988; Rosaldo 1989 and Rabinaw 1988). Moreover, the very same idea of\ngiving voice to informants appeared to originate in the misconstruction of\nthe disproportionate distance established between subject (researcher) and\nobject (informant) of research. The new approach showed that the seemingly\nprogressive endeavour of giving voice to informants ultimately denied the\nprocesses and effects of interactions, negotiations and adaptations taking\nplace in the interview as well as in the process of recording oral genres.\nOn the contrary, recorded interviews and ethnographic writing are rather\nto be understood as encounter and exchange. A possible resolution may be\nto pay careful attention to interactions and negotiations and make explicit\nwhere the researcher\u2019s voice and perspective is constructed and how,\nwhen, and where these take the upper hand in the documentation and in\nthe interpretation. As we have seen, however, these indications still leave\nproblems in the recording and video research and documentation.\nOn authorship\nPhilosophical and literary studies declared the author \u201cdead\u201d as far back as\nthe 1970s,24 but questions of authorship and rights persist all the same. New\n24 We can extrapolate that in Foucault\u2019s approach (1969\/1994), intellectual property does\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 81 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 82 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nelectronic media\u2014in particular the Internet and World Wide Web\u2014have\nopened up very animated discussions on authorship and intellectual property,\nand even fiercer debates as far as copyright and legal issues are concerned.\nA well-known case is exemplified by the discussions on authorship as a\ncollaborative enterprise. New media art is usually created in a very strongly\ncollaborative manner, but tensions arise\u2014sometimes with complicated\nlegal consequences\u2014as \u201coccasionally artists mistakenly claw back to\nindividual authorship when in fact, the final work is highly dependent\non their deep collaboration with computer scientists, designers and all\nmanner of other talents\u201d (Diamond 2003).25 Similar tensions traverse the\nscientific arena, as cooperation between researchers, technicians and\npeople from business enterprises also generates concerns on intellectual\nproperty and authorship. The point is to understand the breadth and depth\nof the collaboration: who has the intellectual initiative and the intellectual\nproperty and, obviously, who can claim the property rights, particularly\nwhen products are on the market to be sold and bought.\nAnother discussion of interest here relates to the rights of indigenous\npeople with regard to knowledge and verbal and visual art forms.\nThe question of intellectual property and the rights of indigenous people\ndeveloped from the experience of expropriation during and after European\nexpansionism and colonialism, when not only lands and resources\nbut also material and immaterial knowledge and arts were exploited to\nthe advantage of museums, universities, international organisations\nand enterprises, individual scholars and businessmen. The United\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 states\nthat \u201cIndigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop and\ntransmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions,\nphilosophies, writing systems and literatures, and to designate and retain\ntheir own names for communities, places and persons\u201d (Article 13). Such\nrights are also to be implemented in political, legal and administrative\nways.26 This UN declaration is interpreted and fought for legally in terms\nnot apply to the \u201cauthor\u201d, as the text is created in an intertextual exchange of ideas and\nwritings belonging to a certain period and society: \u201cno individual can be pointed to as\nthe only source of an idea, as it emerges within far too complex a social and cultural\nmilieu to make any individual imputation sensible\u201d (Longo and Magnolo 2009: 835).\nBarthes (1968\/1984) further disconnects text and author and attributes authorship to the\nreader who constructs meaning, understanding and unity of the text.\n25 See also Manovich (2004).\n26 Article 11.2 states: \u201cStates shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which\nmay include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 82 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 83\nof intellectual property, copyright and economic proceedings when, for\nexample, the so-called imitation industry exploits \u201cdreaming designs\u201d of\nAustralian aboriginal people for commercial gain without authorisation\nand without recognising the copyright and economic damage made to\nthe Aboriginal dreamers\/artists.27 It also stimulates projects of cultural\nrevitalisation, such as the !Khwa ttu: San Culture & Education Centre created\nto counter the impact of so-called ethno-tourism, with game resorts making\na profit on staged encounters between tourists and San families who\u2014\nwithout equitable contracts and respect\u2014are to \u201cact like \u2018wild Bushmen\u2019\u201d\nusing loincloths and posing and dancing on demand.28 As summarised\nby Staehelin (2002) on Cultural Survival,29 the !Khwa ttu project intends to\nimplement \u201ca concept more ambitious than the mere sale of crafts\u201d. 30 We\nread on their website that !Khwaa ttu intends:\nRestore and display San heritage, culture, folklore, visual arts, cosmology\nand languages; Educate the general public about the world of the San;\nProvide training to the San in literacy, entrepreneurship, tourism, health\nissues, community development, craft production\/marketing and gender\nawareness.31\nAlthough these are well meant projects that one can only hope will work\nout as planned, we need to remain aware that the concepts of indigenous\nrights and copyright are problematic. The concept of \u201cindigenous people\u201d\nin postcolonial Africa is very complex and confounding and we could\nrather think in terms of minorities\/majorities or marginalised\/central\n(governing) peoples who, after all, are the indigenous people in Ghana. If\nall groups are indigenous, some groups are more marginalised than others\nto their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free,\nprior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs\u201d. Article\n13.2 states: \u201cStates shall take effective measures to ensure that this right is protected\nand also to ensure that indigenous peoples can understand and be understood in\npolitical, legal and administrative proceedings, where necessary through the provision\nof interpretation or by other appropriate means\u201d. Article 31.2 states \u201cIn conjunction with\nindigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the\nexercise of these rights\u201d.

Such a frame affects the way\nverbal\/visual genres are re-interpreted and imagined by activists, local\npeople, and international partners alike in terms of art and heritage while\nundergoing processes of simplification, standardisation, and hybridisation\nfor present aims and constructions.\nA challenging question arises when we consider the documentation of\noral genres through video and the Internet in light of previous debates:\nWhat do \u201cgiving voice\u201d and \u201ccollaborative authorship\u201d mean in our\nspecific case?\nThe interview: collaborative authorship vs. researchers\nas griots\nIn the case of the interview presented in the Verba Africana series, from\na simply collaborative authorship (\u201ccollaborative\u201d as in the cases when\nthe interviewee is author together with the interviewers) we have to shift\nto a more complicated form of authorship, in which interview credits are\nobviously not a problem, but we as researchers play a decisive, if open, role\nin the way the discourse is presented.\nA more useful framework for looking at this video documentation is\nthat of participant structure introduced by the sociologists Erving Goffman\n(1981) and its elaborations in, for example, Levinson (1988) and also Hill\nand Irvine (1993).33 In this conception there is a principal (who is the source\nof information or text) and an addressee or recipient. But the principal need\nnot be the one who words the information. It may be done by an animator\nwho \u201cgives the principal his\/her voice\u201d. This framework has been fruitfully\nused in the analysis of third party communication or communication\ninvolving intermediaries, such as in the analysis of the role of griots.\nWe think our role is that of the animator and in the context of triadic\ncommunication in Africa acting like the spokesperson of the principal. In\nthis case, the principal is the interviewee and we, Merolla and Ameka, are\nthe animators or editors who shape and polish, embellish, and retouch\noffensive language in more palatable language and communicate it through\nthe medium of Verba Africana to the outside world: the addressees. In this\n32 See Bowen (2000: 12\u201316).\n33 See Yankah (1995) and Ameka (2004) for its application to triadic communication.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 84 5\/13\/13 10:03 AM 4. Researchers as Griots? Reflections on Multimedia Fieldwork in West Africa 85\nway there is distributed authorial responsibility, although we take the\nlion\u2019s share for the effect and any consequences generated by the content\nwe disseminate. We are thus shielding the principal from any attack. Our\nsuggestion of a participant structure approach to the question of authorship\nand authorial responsibility might go a long way towards clarifying some\nof the dilemmas in the area of the so-called collaborative authorship. The\ndilemma is whether the principal\u2014the interviewee\u2014would agree with\nthis perspective on the situation. By virtue of the fact that we have edited\nthe material and are putting the material into the world we have a certain\nresponsibility, moral or otherwise.\nAt the end\nAs Aug\u00e9 writes (1994\/1999: 48), \u201cthe distance between the investigator\nand the object of the investigation does not represent a mere bias [\u2026] but\nrather a constraint\u201d that the researchers should negotiate. The provocative\nidea of \u201cresearchers as griots\u201d distances us from the idea of the egalitarian\npositioning of researchers and storytellers in research and documentation\n(Fabian 1990), because it presents the interviewee as the Principal and the\nresearcher as the animator and intermediary between the interviewee\nand the wider community. It suggests that scholars take responsibility\ntowards storytellers and audience(s) and their three-sided interaction in\nmore complex ways, both scientifically and ethically, than was previously\nadvocated or implemented. The interaction of local and globalising forms\nof knowledge is an increasing phenomenon in Africa, such as in the present\nexample where all the persons involved in the oral performance and its\nvideo documentation belong to the academic\/educative field, although with\ndifferent positions and roles. In such a case, the forms, strategies and aims\nof the \u201cglocal\u201d (local and globalised) knowledge of the storyteller need to\nbe explained to the audience in a form more mediated and critical than the\nvideo documentation of oral genres usually does. The \u201cresearchers as griots\u201d\nthus select the video fragments to mediate (or protect) the communication\nbetween interviewee and audience, and only offer the whole text of the\ninterview with explicative comments.34\n34 We would like to thanks the participants of the conference Archiving Orality and Connecting\nwith Communities: World Oral Literature Project 2010 Workshop, CRASSH, Cambridge, UK\nfor the suggestions to use a new format including several video fragments in the same\nframe, so that different perspectives (also those of the researchers) can be heard.

American Indian Oral Literature,\nCultural Identity and Language\nRevitalisation: Some Considerations\nfor Researchers\nMargaret Field\nThe Kumeyaay community of Baja California\nKumeyaay is the indigenous language of the San Diego area as well as the\nnorthernmost part of Baja California, Mexico, extending southward from\nthe US-Mexico border for about fifty miles. Today, Kumeyaay (specifically,\nthe Tiipay dialect of Kumeyaay) is still actively spoken by about fifty speakers\nwho reside in Mexico, but is very close to obsolescence north of the border.\nThe Tiipay community extends from about fifty miles east of San Diego to\nthe coast, encompassing thirteen distinct communities, each with its own\nslightly different variety of Tiipay. Just north of these Tiipay communities\nare the related \u2018Iipay Kumeyaay communities, which share many similar\ncultural values, but whose dialects are very different (Field, 2012).\nIn all of the Kumeyaay community as well as most of southern\nCalifornia, singers are important repositories of traditional oral literature,\nas stories are typically not only told but also embodied in song cycles\n(Apodaca 1999). In the San Diego area, the most well known of these song\ncycles are \u201cbird songs\u201d, which tell the story of early migrations of Yuman\npeople from the Colorado river area throughout southern Alta California,\nBaja California, and adjacent Arizona. Other song cycles include Lightning\nsongs and Wildcat songs, and this paper will draw on an example of a story\nDOI: 10.111647\/OBP.0032.06.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 91 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 92 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\ntold by a master singer of the Wildcat tradition, Jon Meza Cuero. The story\nis about Rabbit and Frog.1\nThe story \u201cRabbit and Frog\u201d is probably most closely related to the\ngenre of trickster tales, which are found across all of Native North America,\nespecially in the western part of the US; the most commonly known\nsubgenre being \u201ccoyote stories\u201d (Bright 1993). The protagonist in the genre\nof trickster tales need not always be a coyote, but is always a trickster\nwho displays various kinds of culturally dispreferred behaviors, such\nas insincerity, gluttony, and above all egotistical narcissism. The Tiipay\nstory of Rabbit and Frog does not feature a coyote, but instead a frog that\ndisplays trickster-like characteristics. The other main character is Rabbit,\nwho is duped by the trickster and comes to regret it in the end.\nWhen sung in song cycles, traditional stories like this one bring together\ntwo important aspects of communicative competence: cultural knowledge\nin the form of social values and behavioral norms and expectations, as\nwell as traditional language. Mr Meza Cuero is one of the few Kumeyaay\nculture bearers today who is able to tell his stories (as opposed to singing\nthem) in the indigenous language as well. Traditional stories are a key part\nof the process of cultural continuity. As Toelken and Scott have noted in\ntheir study of this genre, coyote stories teach children cultural expectations\nabout appropriate behavior through the use of humour \u201cwithout resort to\ndidacticism\u201d (1981: 106). Storytelling, in this way, is an important part of\nchild socialisation. The cultural knowledge learned through communicative\npractices such as storytelling includes cultural expectations about social\nroles and relationships, including, very importantly for indigenous\nAmerican communities, how to treat family as opposed to strangers. Each\nof these communicative contexts involves slightly different social roles\nthat may also be associated with distinct communicative strategies.2 The\nstory of Rabbit and Frog deals with these roles in particular. Forms of\nknowledge such as these are invariably tacit or taken for granted, and\nthus less accessible to discursive consciousness (Giddens 1979). Embedded\nin traditional stories, they provide good examples of what Bourdieu\n(1977) has called the habitus, or \u201croutine modes of perception, action, and\nevaluation which guide actors in social practice\u201d (Hanks 1996: 238). In this\n1 See Meza Cuero et al. (2013) for a detailed version and translation of this particular story.\n2 See Field (1998) for a discussion of how the pragmatics of directive giving varies across\nthese contexts for Navajo speakers, as well as Nevins (2010) for a discussion of these\ndynamics in the Apache community.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 92 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 5. American Indian Oral Literature, Cultural Identity and Language Revitalisation 93\nway, traditional stories and other forms of oral tradition may be viewed\nas interactional strategies through which cultural identity is discursively\nproduced. Additionally, just as stories act as discourse-level vehicles for\nthe transmission of identity, so does the linguistic variety in which the\nstory is told. Thus, oral literature indexes group identity in multiple ways\n(Kroskrity 2000) as membership in a larger speech community is indexed\nthrough traditional storytelling, yet local dialect indexes membership in a\nsub-community within that larger speech community.\nFor many indigenous communities, the dialect in which a story is\ntold is just as valuable to the community as the content of the story, and\nboth require the careful attention of the researcher. This is especially true\nin indigenous communities where local dialects are important emblems\nof cultural and group identity. For example, in the Tiipay-speaking\nKumeyaay community of Mexico, there are distinct local dialects across\nsix communities, all located within a fifty-mile radius of each other (Field\n2012). Intense lexical variation is found in many indigenous Californian\nand Mexican speech communities (Friedrich 1971; Golla 2000; Field 2012),\nas well as many other indigenous communities around the world (Sutton\n1978), and is closely connected to group identity.\nLanguage ideologies in indigenous communities may also reflect\nbeliefs concerning the relationship between local varieties and community\nidentity, but are not necessarily homogeneous across related speech\ncommunities. For example, members of US Kumeyaay communities\nfrequently express the belief that their dialects are each different enough\nto be considered distinct languages. This attitude exemplifies a typical\n\u201clocalist\u201d language ideology,3 which is linked to a discourse of \u201clocal\ncontrol\u201d (Hill 2002: 123) often seen in south-western US indigenous\nspeech communities. Kumeyaay tribes on the US side of the border are\noften hesitant to share language materials, even with each other, let\nalone academics or non-Kumeyaay people. In contrast, on the Mexican\nside of the border, community language ideologies are typically more\nvariationist (Kroskrity 2002; Kroskrity and Field 2009), such that everyone\nacknowledges dialect variation, yet insists that all dialects are mutually\nintelligible and therefore one language, shared by all. This difference in\nlanguage ideologies between US and Mexican communities is no doubt\nlargely due to differences in histories of contact with two different\n3 See Field (2012) for a lengthier discussion of language ideologies in Kumeyaay communities.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 93 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 94 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\ndominant cultures, as well as other considerations too lengthy to include\nhere (but see Field 2012). More to the point of this paper, this difference\nin language ideologies will no doubt have profound repercussions for\nthe development of future materials for language revitalisation purposes,\nas well as very different considerations for researchers working on these\nrelated dialects on each side of the international border.\nAlthough geographically connected communities may share very\nsimilar, if not identical, versions of traditional stories, storytellers from\nspecific communities inject their own community\u2019s idiom into them,\nmarking them as symbols of local community identity and making them\nnot only very different from each other but clearly indexical of the local\ncommunity the storyteller is from. These facts lead to a couple of important\nlanguage-related considerations for researchers of oral literature: firstly,\nthe effects this research may have on language revitalisation efforts; and\nsecondly, the imperative to work collaboratively with the community, and\nprioritise their wishes concerning access to and future uses of any collected\ntexts. These points are expanded upon below.\nFirstly, when archiving and publishing language materials from\ncommunities without a tradition of literacy, it is important to be aware that\nmaking any materials public may affect language revitalisation efforts in\nthat community. If there is no standard dialect, or orthography, published\nresearch may potentially affect what might be a delicate political balance\nbetween factions of the speech community, or may have an impact on\nlanguage maintenance. For example, if materials from only one dialect\nare published to a greater extent than another, this may result in de facto\npromotion of that one dialect to the status of \u201cstandard\u201d, and may privilege\nthat variety over others for use in future language revitalisation efforts\n(Muhlhauser 1996; Hale 2001; Eisenlohr 2004; Hill 2002).\nIn Native North America, there is today not a single speech community\nthat is not endangered at some level. According to a study by Michael\nKrauss done a little over a decade ago, out of 211 indigenous languages\nstill spoken in North America, 85% of them are now moribund (or lack\nchild speakers). Ironically, this situation continues to worsen even as\nindigenous communities improve their economic conditions, because\ndominant languages and cultures increasingly penetrate even the most\nremote communities, along with roads, electricity, and greater access to\nvarious forms of media in dominant languages.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 94 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 5. American Indian Oral Literature, Cultural Identity and Language Revitalisation 95\nSecondly, even though the goals of research on oral literatures and\nendangered languages may be to preserve them for posterity, indigenous\ncommunities may not all be in accord with this common academic goal,\nor with the assumption that all knowledge should be shared (Hill 2002).\nIntellectual property concerns are always an important consideration for\nAmerican Indian communities. Even though a recorded story may already\nbe published, the language or dialect in which it is told may not be, and\nthe language itself may be considered intellectual property by the speech\ncommunity. In the US and Canada it is standard operating procedure\nwhen working with indigenous languages to request consent from tribal\ngovernments (in addition to individual speakers and storytellers) before\nbeginning fieldwork. As Battiste and Henderson (2000) recommend:\nEthical research systems and practices should enable indigenous nations,\npeople, and communities to exercise control over information related to their\nknowledge and heritage and to themselves. [\u2026] To act otherwise is to repeat\nthat familiar pattern of decisions being made for Indigenous people by those\nwho presume to know what is best for them. (Cited in Rice 2006: 133)\nIdeally, initial contact with the indigenous community should include:\n1) Discussion of how any resulting materials may be used to\npromote or enhance linguistic and cultural maintenance and\/or\nrevitalisation effort\n2) Plans for publication and archiving, including the content of\nconsent forms specifying exactly what, if any, limitations the\ncommunity might prefer in terms of future access to recorded\nmaterials\nGreat care should be taken in recording and archiving oral literature for\nposterity. The website E-MELD (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered\nLanguages Documentation) is one of the best places to find information on\nhow to do this.

In doing\nso, the storyteller is explaining that this story has been passed down to him\nfrom the ancestors.\nThe genre is made clear in the next few lines, which indicate that it\nrefers to a mythic time period found across most of Native America, and\nespecially in California creation stories, in which animals figure largely as\ncreators:\nMatt \u2018ekur, Long ago,\ntipay pi tenyewaay, people were here,\nmatt pi tenyewaay. they were in this place.\nTipay m\u00e1wa, They were not people,\nchiillyich. they were animals.\n4 See Baumann (1992); Jahner (1999); and Sekaquaptewa & Washburn (2004) for the\nimportance of oral literature as cultural resources which retain and reinforce cultural\nvalues and group identity.\n5 I am indebted to noted Yuman linguist Amy Miller for her help in transcribing and\ntranslating this story.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 96 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 5.

He had a house.\nRabbit was in his house, and was warm.\nFrog passed by the house.\nFrog peeked inside.\nRabbit was sitting inside. He was eating.\nFrog passed by and went away.\nA few days later, Frog came passing by.\n\u2018Hi! How are you?\u2019 he said as he arrived.\n\u2018I\u2019m fine, and you?\u2019 (said Rabbit).\n\u2018I\u2019m fine. Gee, it\u2019s very cold outside!\u2019 (said Frog).\n\u2018It\u2019s cold? It\u2019s nice and warm in here.\u2019 (said Rabbit).\n\u2018I\u2019m really cold.\u2019 (said Frog), rubbing his hands together. \u2018Gee, it\u2019s\nreally cold.\u2019\n\u2018Oh?\u2019 (said Rabbit). \u2018Walk around and you\u2019ll be alright.\u2019\n\u2018You are from outside and you must stay outside. God made you so\nthat you would live outside. I do not, I am a rabbit, and I must stay\nin my house.\u2019\n\u2018Alright, see you soon.\u2019 said Frog. \u2018I\u2019m going now.\u2019\nAnd he went hopping away\u2014hop! hop! hop!\nIn two or three days, he came back.\n\u2018Hello Brother!\u2019 he said. \u2018How are you?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m fine. How are you?\u2019 (asked Rabbit).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 97 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 98 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\n\u2018Oh, I\u2019m really cold.\u2019 (said Frog).\nThis exchange happens three times, but the third time, Rabbit changes his\nmind, lets him in, and goes out to find some food for both of them to eat:\nRabbit went out looking for food.\nHe came back much later.\n\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 (Rabbit) said.\n\u2018Nothing, I\u2019m fine here.\u2019 (said Frog).\n(Rabbit) gave him food, and (Frog) just sat there eating.\n\u2018Oh, the food is really good!\u2019 (said Frog).\nOne day went by. Two days went by.\n(Rabbit) went out again looking for food.\nWhen it was late he came back.\nFrog was just sitting in there, big and puffed up.\n\u2018Hello Brother! How are you? Are you sick or something?\u2019\n(asked Rabbit).\n\u2018No, I\u2019m fine\u2019 (Frog said).\n\u2018Why are you so big?\u2019 (asked Rabbit).\n\u2018Why am I big? Everyday you bring me food!\nI\u2019m just going to sit here getting fat!\u2019 (said Frog).\nThree days later, frog was at his biggest.\n\u2018Your belly is really very big!\u2019 (said Rabbit).\n\u2018Oh? So what if it is very big?\u2019 (said Frog).\n\u2018If I am to fit in the house, you have to leave!\u2019 (said Rabbit).\n\u2018No, no, it\u2019s my house!\u2019 (said Frog).\n\u2018It\u2019s really, really, really good, my belly is very big.\u2019 (said Frog).\n\u2018Okay then, you stay here, and I\u2019ll go away.\u2019 (said Rabbit).\nHe did it very reluctantly.\nFrog stayed in the house.\nHe stayed, and Rabbit went away, looking for another house.\nThat\u2019ll be the end of it, this thing that I\u2019ve been telling.\nAs is usually the case in trickster tales, there is no overt evaluation by the\nstoryteller (Beck and Walters 1977; Toelken and Scott 1981); rather, the\nlisteners must infer the moral for themselves. But it is easy to discern the\nmoral of this story: after inviting Frog into his home, industrious Rabbit\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 98 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 5. American Indian Oral Literature, Cultural Identity and Language Revitalisation 99\nloses it to the ungrateful and selfish Frog. What did Rabbit do to deserve\nthis fate? He acted against his initial better judgment (concerning frogs\nbelonging outside) and embraced Frog, a relative stranger, as a kinsman\nand brother. Following traditional Kumeyaay protocol, Rabbit feeds Frog,\nbut Frog just sits there getting fatter and fatter until there is no room for\nRabbit in his own home. One can infer from this tale that in the traditional\nKumeyaay view it is important to be selective in deciding whom to offer\nhospitality, as well as to be suspicious of strangers who are quick to claim\na kinship relation.\nLike any good trickster, Frog also displays several negative behavioral\ncharacteristics, including laziness, insincerity and greed. Children learn\ncultural values from trickster tales by learning how not to behave; in this\ncase, from the actions of both the trickster and Rabbit. Stories like this are\nclassic examples of traditional indigenous pedagogy.\nThe story of Rabbit and Frog was collected as part of a larger project\ndocumenting the Kumeyaay dialects spoken in Baja California.6 It will\neventually be archived at the Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin\nAmerica at the University of Texas, Austin (AILLA),7 so that it will be\navailable via the Internet in both Spanish and English to members of the\nKumeyaay community on both sides of the border as well as researchers.\nThe decision to make all language files available via the Internet was made\nby members of the Baja Kumeyaay community, who came together with\nproject staff repeatedly in community language workshops held every three\nmonths over the duration of the project. Mexican Kumeyaay community\nmembers especially expressed the desire for community teachers to be\nable to access stories and other recordings8 for language revitalisation\n6 This work is based upon material supported by the National Science Foundation under\nGrant No. # BCS-0753853. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations\nexpressed in this material are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views\nof the National Science Foundation.\n7 I chose the AILLA archive because of the compatibility of their mission statement with\nthe goals of this project: 1) preservation of indigenous language materials from Latin\nAmerica, 2) accessibility of these materials (in terms of making sure that non-proprietary\nformats are used in recording, consent forms are obtained, and intellectual property\nrights are respected), and 3) community support for the indigenous speech communities\nof Latin America, in terms of making sure these materials are also available for them to\nuse for language revitalisation purposes.\n8 We did not record any ritual language or content considered too sensitive to share\nwith the outside world. In addition to traditional narratives and narratives about how\nto perform traditional activities such as basket making and pottery, we also recorded\nconversation and wordlists which will be used to create a multidialectal Kumeyaay\ndictionary.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 99 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 100 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\npurposes. Because this story and others were recorded in both Kumeyaay\nand Spanish, they will be important for this purpose, but they will also\nbe equally vital as traditional Kumeyaay educational materials that impart\nmore than just linguistic information. In this way, they will be important to\nfuture Kumeyaay communities in maintaining not only their language, but\ntheir cultural identity as well.\nReferences\nApodaca, Paul, \u2018Tradition, Myth, and Performance of Cahuilla Bird Songs\u2019\n(unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of California, 1999).\nBattiste, Marie and Sa\u2019ke\u2019j Henderson, Protecting Indigenous Knowledge and Heritage:\nA Global Challenge (Saskatoon, SK: Purich, 2000).\nBauman, Richard, \u2018Contextualization, Tradition, and the Dialogue of Genres:\nIcelandic Legends of the Kraftaskald\u2019, in Rethinking Context: Language as an\nInteractive Phenomenon, ed. by Alessandro Duranti and Charles Goodwin\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 125\u2013145.\nBeck, Peggy and Anna Walters, The Sacred: Ways of Knowledge, Sources of Life (Tsaile:\nNavajo Community College, 1977).\nBourdieu, Pierre, Outline of a Theory of Practice, trans. by R.

Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures:\nAstride Orality and Literacy\nJorge G\u00f3mez Rend\u00f3n\nIndigenous languages in Ecuador: survival and\nchange\nEcuador is the smallest of the Andean countries but is linguistically diverse.\nIndigenous languages have not successfully entered literacy through\neducational programmes and are now critically endangered. Eleven\nindigenous languages from six different language families, including two\nunclassified ones, are spoken in Ecuador (G\u00f3mez Rend\u00f3n 2009: 7).1 Kichwa\nis the most popular indigenous language: it is spoken in the Andean\nhighlands and the Amazon lowlands, and nowadays also in several\ncoastal cities and some towns of the Galapagos Islands as a result of labour\nmigration. While the indigenous population in the highlands is the largest\nin the country, the indigenous population in the Amazon lowlands is the\nmost diverse in linguistic terms. The Amazon lowlands are home to nine\nof Ecuador\u2019s eleven indigenous languages. The linguistic diversity of the\nlowlands mirrors the sociocultural and biological diversity characteristic of\nthe country as a whole and of the Amazon basin in particular.2\n1 In the Andean highlands: Highland Kichwa (Quechua); Tsa\u2019fiki (Barbacoan); Awapit\n(Barbacoan). In the Pacific lowlands: Sia Pedee (Chocoan); Cha\u2019palaa (Barbacoan).\nIn the Amazon lowlands: Amazonian Kichwa (Quechua); A\u2019ingae (unclassified);\nPaikoka-Baicoca (Western Tukanoan); Wao tededo (unclassified); Kayap (Zaparoan);\nAchuar chicham (Jivaroan); Shuar-Shiwiar chicham (Jivaroan).\n2 Ecuador is considered one of the richest countries in terms of biodiversity and endemic\nspecies. Ten percent of the world\u2019s animal and vegetal species live in a small area of 256,370\nsquare kilometers corresponding to 0.17% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Mittermeier 1988).\nDOI: 10.111647\/OBP.0032.07.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 103 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 104 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nThere is no agreement on the specific number of speakers of indigenous\nlanguages in Ecuador. This is due to the lack of transparent and updated\nsociolinguistic data. The size of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous population is clearly\na political issue both for the government and indigenous peoples. The\nConfederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), the\nlargest indigenous organisation in the country, states that indigenous\npeople represented one third (4,052,150) of the country\u2019s population\n(12,156,608) registered in 2001. In turn, the Council of Development of the\nNationalities and Peoples of Ecuador (CONDENPE), the governmental\nagency of Indian affairs, maintains that Ecuador\u2019s indigenous people\nrepresent only 11 percent (1,103,957) of the national population (L\u00f3pez\n& Garc\u00eda 2009: 590). Moreover, the last census (2010) established that only\n7 percent (1,018,176) of Ecuador\u2019s population is of indigenous descent\n(INEC 2010). However, the way in which censuses have been conducted\nso far is less than clear and the resulting data is often biased when it comes\nto indigenous peoples and communities. Today, an indigenous population\nof 2,000,000 is a reasonable estimate. Still, caution is needed because ethnic\npopulation\u2014i.e. people self-claiming to be indigenous\u2014is not equivalent\nto speaking population\u2014i.e. people speaking one of the eleven indigenous\nlanguages. In such a case, the ratio between both populations depends\non the ethnic group. Thus, the Cof\u00e1n ethnic population is rather close to\nthe population of speakers of A\u2019ingae, the Cof\u00e1n ethnic language, even\nif the rate of bilingualism among them is high; on the contrary, speakers\nof Kayap\u0254, the Zapara ethnic language, count only 5 elders, representing\nscarcely 4% of the ethnic population (115), all of which speaks Amazonian\nKichwa (Andrade 2001: 7).\nThe widespread use of Spanish in urban and rural areas, the labour\nmigration of indigenous people to the cities and the partial success of\nbilingual education programmes have been determining factors in the\ndecreasing vitality of indigenous languages. According to the UNESCO\nclassification of endangerment (Moseley 2010), all of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous\nlanguages are in one way or another endangered and two have become\nextinct since the mid-seventies, Andoa and Tetete.3\n3 Those critically endangered include Sia Pedee (Chocoan) and Zaparo (Zaparoan); the\ngroup of severely endangered languages is comprised of Paikoka-Baicoca (Western\nTukanoan), Shiwiar (Jivaroan), Awapit (Barbacoan) as well as the highland varieties of\nKichwa spoken in the provinces of Ca\u00f1ar, Azuay and Loja. Languages with a lesser\ndegree of endangerment are A\u2019ingae (unclassified), Achuar (Jivaroan), Shuar (Jivaroan),\nTsa\u2019fiki (Barbacoan), Cha\u2019palaa (Barbacoan), and other highland and lowland varieties of\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 104 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 105\nThe classification of indigenous languages should be taken with caution\nbecause it is based mostly on estimates from census data. Only recently\nsociolinguistic surveys are being conducted among speakers of indigenous\nlanguages in order to determine their population with accuracy. Two\nof these languages are Tsa\u2019fiki and Awapit. In both cases the data show\ntendencies different from those presented above (G\u00f3mez Rend\u00f3n 2010a and\n2011). Thus, Tsa\u2019fiki should be considered a severely endangered language\ninstead of a definitely endangered one, while Awapit is best classified as\na critically endangered language rather than a severely endangered one\nin UNESCO\u2019s terms. Indeed, not even the indigenous languages with the\nlargest population of speakers (Kichwa and Shuar) can be considered\nsafe. On the other hand, one of these languages, Kichwa, has become so\nwidespread in the Amazon lowlands that an increasing number of speakers\nof other minority languages are shifting to Kichwa. Similarly, Wao tededo,\nconsidered only vulnerable by UNESCO, is at present the most potentially\nendangered of all indigenous languages in the eastern lowlands because of\nlabour migration and oil extraction activities within Wao ethnic territory.\nMoreover, this territory, which is part of an important wildlife reserve,\nYasun\u00ed National Park, is home to the uncontacted peoples Taromenani and\nTagaeri (Cabodevilla 2009).\nIndigenous languages have become visible to the Ecuadorian\nSpanish-speaking society only in the last few decades thanks to the\nsuccessful positioning of the indigenous movement since the mid 1980s\nand the principles of plurinationality and interculturality established\nby the 2008 Constitution. And yet, their use in public domains and\neducation and their inter-generational transmission have not improved\ncorrespondingly. Ecuador remains a largely monolingual state and\npolicy makers are more concerned with how to assimilate indigenous\nminorities into mainstream society and less with how to promote cultural\nand linguistic diversity as part of the country\u2019s ethnic composition.\nThe Constitution passed in 2008 establishes Spanish as the official\nlanguage of the country while recognising Kichwa and Shuar as official\nlanguages of intercultural communication and the other indigenous\nlanguages as official in their respective ethnic territories. The Constitution\nrequires that the State promote intercultural communication in indigenous\nlanguages and give indigenous peoples all the means necessary to develop\nKichwa. Wao tededo, the ethnic language of the Waorani group, is considered vulnerable,\ni.e. the least endangered of all.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 105 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 106 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nan education system in their own language and with their own cultural\ncontents. There has been some progress in intercultural bilingual education\nin the last two decades but there is still a long way to go. The appropriateness\nof the intercultural bilingual approach to indigenous education is now\nunder discussion because a large portion of the ethnic population is still\nilliterate and the reading and writing of indigenous languages outside\nschools is minimal.\nIndigenous languages and literacy: a tenuous\nrelationship\nNowadays, each of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous languages has its own alphabet\nand orthography (Haboud 2009: 354).4 Of course, these alphabets are not\nused by speakers of indigenous languages on an everyday basis. Except\nfor Kichwa and Shuar, all other indigenous languages are written only\nin schools of the intercultural bilingual education system. Accordingly,\ntextbooks and official documents in indigenous languages have very\nreduced readerships. This is explained firstly by the small number of\nindigenous speakers who can read and write in their native languages, and\nsecondly by the type of language used in writing, full of coined expressions\nand neologisms that obscure the message.\nThe entry of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous languages into literacy is rather late\nas it took place only in the second half of the twentieth century. The only\nexception is Kichwa, a native language with a writing tradition dating back\nto the first missionaries who made use of it for evangelisation purposes\nin the early colonial period. They prepared grammars, dictionaries and\nreligious texts including collections of prayers and catechisms.5 Of course,\nall these texts were mainly intended for Spanish-speaking students of the\nlanguage and not for the formal learning of grammar by Kichwa native\nspeakers. These native speakers learnt to read and write in their language\n4 This holds true even for the now extinct language Shimigae (Zaparoan), the ethnic\nlanguage of the Andoa people, which was documented with its last speaker by the\nauthor in 2009. The outcome was a basic bilingual dictionary and a grammar for use in\nthe re-introduction of the native language in Andoan schools (G\u00f3mez Rend\u00f3n 2010b).\n5 The first grammar of Kichwa was written by Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s and published\nin Valladolid in 1564. The grammar was used for the teaching of the Inca language to\npriests and novices but also to Spanish-speaking civil servants who would deal with\nKichwa communities (Cerr\u00f3n-Palomino 1995: VII\u2013LXVI).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 106 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 107\nonly in the last decades of the twentieth century through bilingual\neducation programmes. As for the other indigenous languages, their use\nin written form is even more recent. The first dictionary of Shuar (Jivaroan)\nappeared only in 1929 (Pe\u00f1aherrera de Costales and Costales 2006: 181)\nand was prepared only for priests working in the Apostolic Vicariate of\nMendez to learn the language for evangelisation ends.\nThe arrival of missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics\n(SIL) in 1948 became a landmark in the literacy of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous\nlanguages. Based on the teaching of the Bible, their missionary work\nrequired a translation in the indigenous languages of the peoples they\nwanted to convert. Thus, their first efforts were devoted to carefully\nstudying indigenous languages and giving them a writing system that\ncould be easily used for reading and writing by missionaries and native\nspeakers. SIL missionaries used the same Roman alphabet of the official\nlanguage, with several diacritical marks to convey phonetic specificities.\nWith some amendments introduced in the 1990s and 2000s, these alphabets\nare still used today in the intercultural bilingual education system.\nThe normativisation introduced by SIL missionaries had positive effects\non creating a literacy tradition that survives in Ecuador to date. Literacy\nin indigenous languages was envisioned mainly for native speakers\ncompared to the literacy tradition introduced by priests. But the work\nof SIL missionaries was not exempt from criticism: for one thing, the\nindoctrination in Western values and concepts destroyed native systems of\nbeliefs and social interaction; for another, the use of literacy in indigenous\nlanguages was too often limited to religious contents and disregarded\nculturally significant material. Also, with a view to producing ready-made\nalphabets in order to begin with their evangelisation work, SIL missionaries\nset aside important dialectal differences that later on became a matter of\ncontention among indigenous peoples, particularly once they became\npolitically and culturally empowered in the last decades of the twentieth\ncentury (Stoll 2002).\nMany other important advances in the literacy of indigenous languages\ntook place during the second half of the twentieth century, particularly\namong the Kichwa-speaking communities. A model of literacy development\nwas designed and self-managed by speech communities. In the early\n1940s Dolores Cacuango, a female Kichwa activist, created a network of\nschools with the support of several urban women and local indigenous\nleaders; the schools were run by indigenous teachers who used the native\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 107 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 108 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nlanguage and promoted the indigenous culture and the defense of the\nethnic territory. This experience is considered seminal for the development\nof today\u2019s intercultural bilingual education model. Similar literacy projects\nwere carried out in the sixties and seventies in Bol\u00edvar (Simiatug) and\nCotopaxi (Zumbahua and Chucchil\u00e1n) with self-management or support\nfrom religious orders (Conejo 2008: 66\u201367). Other innovative experiences\nincluded the so-called radio schools (Escuelas Radiof\u00f3nicas Populares)\nwhich broadcast for Kichwa speakers in the central highlands and for\nShuar speakers in the eastern slopes. The remaining indigenous languages\ndid not have literacy programs until the late 1980s.\nThe eighties was a decade of progress in the self-organisation of\nindigenous peoples in Ecuador. They strengthened their political stance\nand became visible and influential in the political arena (S\u00e1nchez-Parga\n2010: 86). At that time, CONAIE, the largest indigenous organisation\ngrouping representatives from all native peoples of the country, submitted\nan education proposal to the government which resulted in the creation\nof the National Director\u2019s Office of Intercultural Bilingual Education\n(DINEIB) in November 1988. Also, by an agreement between the Ministry of\nEducation and DINEIB, the latter began to work on indigenous languages\nin order to conduct linguistic and pedagogic research for the preparation\nof teaching materials and training of bilingual teachers. Until February\n2009, a few months after its twentieth anniversary, DINEIB operated as\na financially and politically autonomous educational agency. At present,\nits status within the reformed educational system is still unclear. While\nnobody questions the importance of bilingual education as a mechanism\nfor enforcing interculturality and plurinationality, the effectiveness of its\nadministrative and organisational aspects has been criticised.\nThe outcomes of twenty years of intercultural education are not\nunimportant. By 2007, DINEIB ran 2,833 educational centres including\nprimary and secondary schools as well as pedagogical and technical\ncolleges, with 130,348 students and 8,355 bilingual teachers working in the\nhighlands, the Pacific and Amazon lowlands and the Galapagos Islands\n(Conejo 2008: 79). Since 1993, all educational centers run by DINEIB\nhave followed the Model of Intercultural Bilingual Education System\n(Conejo 2010) amended according to the last developments in curriculum\nplanning and design by the Ministry of Education. Numerous teaching\nmaterials in book and digital formats have been produced since 1989,\nalthough the number of these materials is much larger for Kichwa and\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 108 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 109\nShuar than for the other languages, for some of which there are no updated\nteaching aids available, except those produced by private initiative. Also,\nthere has been substantial progress in the normativisation of indigenous\nlanguages through a consensus-based definition of spelling in order to\nfacilitate the teaching and learning of indigenous languages without the\ninterference of the official language. Still, the changes in the spelling of\nindigenous languages continue to be a matter of contention, especially\nfor those languages with an important dialectal variation such as Kichwa.\nIn this respect, the process of identity politics led by indigenous peoples\nsince the 1990s has in turn strengthened the linguistic identity of speech\ncommunities. In this context, the recent changes in the spelling system of\nKichwa in 2008 have been strongly criticised by many highland communities,\nwith the resulting rejection of teaching aids printed with the new spelling\nand the migration of school children to Spanish-speaking schools.\nBut these are not the biggest problems of intercultural bilingual\neducation. The most serious obstacle to overcome is threefold: first,\nincreasing retention and dropout rates in primary schools; second, the\nlack of a sound methodology and the poor training of bilingual teachers;\nand last but not least, the widely attested facts that literacy in indigenous\nlanguages occurs only in bilingual schools and \u201cbilingual\u201d students do not\nmake any practical use of their native languages in writing beyond the\nclassroom.\nIn sum, two decades of intercultural bilingual education have not\nresulted in a prolific and productive use of indigenous languages, neither\nin community contexts nor in public domains. Moreover, indigenous\nlanguages continue to be predominantly oral because their written use\nis limited and this limitation is most probably caused by the difficulties\ninvolved in writing due to changing spellings and the overuse of\nneologisms far from everyday natural speech.6 And yet, this failure is, in\nmy opinion, not imputable to intercultural bilingual education but to the\nunsatisfactory implementation of the model. Such implementation has\ndisregarded the century-long oral tradition of indigenous languages and\ncultures and made all the efforts to bring them into literacy without any\n6 Recent research supervised by the author found that writing in Spanish too is a problem\nfor children attending intercultural bilingual schools. They cannot coordinate sentences\nproperly and make themselves understood in Spanish. This means that the model of\nintercultural bilingual education as implemented so far has not succeeded in attaining\nproficiency in the official language (Contreras 2010).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 109 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 110 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nconsideration of their functionality. From this perspective, the fact that\nindigenous languages in Ecuador remain predominantly oral and alien to\nliteracy should not be seen pessimistically. Orality must be integrated to\nintercultural bilingual education as a point of departure for literacy and\nthe most important source of traditional culture and everyday knowledge.\nBringing orality to the foreground: new approaches\nin indigenous education and culture\nEvery human language has its roots in speech, and orality is speech by\ndefinition. Literacy is only a byproduct of culture and a medium for\nrepresenting speech visually for recording and archiving purposes.\nChildren learn languages first by listening while their first output is almost\nalways oral. Literacy becomes part of their language only through formal\nschooling. Too often we forget this truism, perhaps because our visual\nculture leads us to assume that written signs are the essence of language.\nHowever, if literacy seems for us connatural to language, it is not the case\nfor other societies, especially if they have been only lately exposed to\nwritten language. If such is the case of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous languages,\nthen any educational model that makes use of them must bring orality to\nthe foreground.\nThe above statement should not, however, be interpreted as if\nindigenous languages are not capable of becoming literate; the living proof\nof it are the hundreds of indigenous languages in the five continents which\nlacked a writing system before the twentieth century and now are widely\nused in written form. And yet, orality continues to be their main mode\nof communication and the most natural context in which their cultural\nheritage is passed on to new generations. It is therefore misleading to\nassume that the gap between orality and literacy in indigenous languages\ncan be bridged in any successful way in only a few decades.\nBilingual education models should not forget the history of literacy\nbehind their languages. In the case of bilingual education in Ecuador, the\nhistory of literacy in the official language (Spanish) boasts hundreds of\nyears while the same history in indigenous languages is in its infancy.\nBut, most importantly, bilingual education models should not disregard\nwhat is perhaps the most influential of all factors, i.e. diglossia. Indeed,\nthe official language in Ecuador has a privileged sociopolitical position\nvis-\u00e0-vis indigenous languages, and while the official language is used in\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 110 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 111\nprivate and public domains alike, indigenous languages are restricted to\nfamily and community. The pressure exerted by the official language on\nspeakers of indigenous languages has led to Hispanicisation (speakers\u2019\nshift to Spanish by abandoning their mother tongue) or language mixing\n(speakers\u2019 use of Spanish lexical and grammatical borrowings with\nstructural changes in the native languages).\nAgainst this backdrop of historical, political and social factors that\ninfluence literacy in indigenous languages, it is self-evident that orality is\nnot a drawback in bilingual education, i.e. something that formal schooling\nmust eradicate once and for all. On the contrary, orality should be the point\nof departure for literacy in indigenous languages, and the best way to show\nand perform orality is through ears and eyes and always in contexts of\ncultural significance.\nLanguage labs: a meeting point for orality and\nliteracy\nWhile the idea of a language laboratory is not new for the teaching and\nlearning of international languages such as English or French, the same idea\nbrought to the field of indigenous languages becomes a challenge to the\nracist prejudice that views indigenous languages as \u201cdialects\u201d undeserving\nthe investment of time and money. Behind this prejudice is the surviving\nromantic idea that indigenous languages are by definition \u201ctraditional\u201d,\nsomething of the \u201cpast\u201d that cannot be the object of \u201cmodern\u201d technologies.\nUnfortunately, this view is held by most Spanish monolingual citizens\nin the cities. In this context, the concept of a language laboratory was\nlaunched as an innovative though risky proposal for intercultural bilingual\neducation in 2008. Being an expensive project, it was designed first only for\nKichwa, the largest language in terms of the number of speakers but also\nthe one with enough digital material available.\nThe conditions in which the project was launched were particularly\nfavourable as the language laboratory became, since then, part of the\nso-called \u201cmillennium schools\u201d. Millennium schools are educational\ncentres located in poor, mostly rural areas that so far have been neglected\nin education. Their facilities and architectonic design are related to\nan innovative pedagogical model which takes into account the local\nethnographic characteristics; facilities include so-called \u201cthematic\u201d\nclassrooms for the teaching of specific subjects and are equipped with\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 111 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 112 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\ncutting-edge technologies. However, the most important and innovative\ncharacteristics of millennium schools have to do with their pedagogical\nmodel. Given their experimental nature, millennium schools follow a\nparticipative educational project that takes into consideration the cultural,\nsocial and economic elements of their areas of influence and seek to\nestablish a democratic and equitable culture in economic, social, ethnic\nand gender terms. In sum, millennium schools make use of an innovative\neducational model alongside proper facilities, teaching aids, well-trained\nteachers, and the active participation of parents and community.\nThe Kichwa language laboratory implemented in millennium schools\nhas four components as described in the following:\n1) Linguistic software for interlinearised transcription of\naudiovisual files, lexical databases, morphological parsing and\nacoustic analysis; the software was intended mainly for the\ntraining of Kichwa language teachers in grammatical analysis\nand lexicography, but also for them to collect and edit pieces of\noral tradition\n2) Digital resources that include a multimedia dictionary for\nchildren, a touch screen board, thematic maps and different\naccessories in Kichwa; these resources were intended for\nschool children as a first introduction to Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICTs)\n3) A library of digital books in Kichwa and footage of different\nsize, from films to video clips about various aspects of Kichwa\nculture, including traditional music and songs in the language,\na collection of myths and legends told by storytellers from\ndifferent Kichwa communities, and several didactic videos for\nteaching specific skills such as weaving, sculpting, painting and\ncarving\n4) Digital teaching aids including interactive textbooks and\nworkbooks as well as tests for evaluation of the learning progress\nThe language laboratory was designed as an interactive space for\nKichwa-speaking children to use their native language orally and in writing.\nChildren would be exposed to speech events in their own cultural contexts\nthrough the use of multimedia. The principle behind this design is that\naudiovisual material, if properly used, provides contextualised language\nlearning in culturally significant situations through listening and watching.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 112 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 113\nThe same principle is applied to the learning of grammar. In this case,\nchildren are not passive learners of rules but assimilate such rules from\nlistening to examples of spontaneous speech that they can play once and\nagain.\nAt the moment Kichwa language laboratories have been implemented\nin all millennium schools located in Kichwa-speaking areas and also in\na few Spanish-speaking schools, as Kichwa is a language of intercultural\ncommunication and all Ecuadorian citizens ought to know it at least\nrudimentarily. While several problems have arisen in the experimental\nstage, which have to do with the insufficient training of teachers in the\nproper use of high-tech equipment and software, the project is still\nunderway and is expected to extend to other indigenous languages.\nIntangible cultural heritage: the coming of age\nof a concept and its use in identity politics and\nindigenous education\nThe concept of \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d is not as old as that of\n\u201ccultural heritage\u201d. However, in the early 1990s, discussions began about\nthe so-called intangible aspects of culture, and UNESCO finally adopted\na Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003\n(UNESCO 2003).7 In Ecuador the implementation of the 2003 Convention\nhas resulted in an official recognition of the heritage status of indigenous\ncultures, so far reduced to folklore in state policies.\nEcuador became a state party to UNESCO in 1975 through the acceptance\nof the World Heritage Convention. Since then, it has participated actively in\nthe safeguarding of architectonic heritage. This resulted in the inscription\nof Quito\u2019s historic centre in the world heritage list and the foundation\nof a specific agency devoted to safeguarding Ecuador\u2019s cultural heritage\n(Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural). This heritage included two\nsets of elements: 1) architectonic pieces and sites in urban areas; and 2)\narchaeological monuments and sites, most of them associated with the Inca\npresence in Ecuador. Because indigenous peoples do not have monuments\n7 The Convention defines intangible cultural heritage as \u201cthe practices, representations,\nexpressions, knowledge, skills\u2014as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural\nspaces associated therewith\u2014that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals\nrecognise as part of their cultural heritage\u201d (UNESCO 2003).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 113 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 114 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nor sites of the same sort as those found in cities and archeological complexes,\ntheir material cultures, let alone other less \u201ctangible\u201d expressions, were\nnever considered a form of cultural heritage.\nThe acceptance and ratification of the Convention by Ecuador in 2008\nrepresented a dramatic turn in cultural politics, with great influence on\nthe public management of cultures, those of the urban Spanish-speaking\npopulation and those of the indigenous peoples all over the country.\nMoreover, the acceptance of the Convention is a landmark in the recognition\nand promotion of cultural rights as it is congruent with the principles of\ninterculturality and plurinationality claimed by the Ecuadorian state.\nThe instrumentality of intangible cultural heritage has been seriously\nconsidered by governmental agencies and is being evaluated by\nindigenous peoples as a mechanism to enforce their collective rights\nbefore the state. This is made possible because intangible cultural heritage\nis linked to other fields of public policy such as health care and education,\nand because the concept of cultural heritage includes a network of\nmultifarious expressions and prescribes the understanding of cultures in\ntheir own specificities. In the case of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous peoples, such\nspecificities are necessarily determined by their languages and the oral\ncharacter of their tradition.\nImmediately after the acceptance by Ecuador of the Convention for the\nSafeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, a nation-wide project was\nconducted for the identification of intangible heritage among indigenous\npeoples. Another nation-wide project was started in 2010 to produce a more\ndetailed, ethnographic and multimedia inventory of intangible heritage\nin order to take specific measures of safeguarding. The outcomes of both\nprojects so far have been significant and include 1) a database containing\nhundreds of intangible elements of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous cultures, with their\nbasic description, identification data and georeference; and 2) audiovisual\nmaterial of different expressions of intangible heritage, including festivals,\ncrafts, medicinal knowledge, oral tradition, and so forth. Together with the\nsafeguarding of previously identified heritage in danger of extinction, one\nstep towards the empowering of communities in the management of their\nown heritages is to mobilise the outcomes of inventory and documentation\nfor educational purposes and the revitalisation of indigenous cultures.\nWhen it comes to this point, however, the State and the indigenous peoples\nhave to come to terms with delicate issues concerning intellectual property\nrights, the return of outcomes to the communities, the practical accessibility\nof such outcomes, and the management of audiovisual material. This task\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 114 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 115\nis not easy in the absence of a law on intellectual property rights, a code of\nconduct and a general framework that enables the direct participation of\nindigenous peoples in decision making about their own heritage.\nEthical and legal issues in orality and literacy\nconcerning indigenous peoples\nThe folklorisation of indigenous cultures in Ecuador by governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies has prevented their consideration as objects\nof legal protection. By considering intangible culture as people\u2019s heritage,\nthe 2003 Convention paves the way for their protection as property with\nall of the related rights.\nThe fact that intangible cultural heritage often lacks physical support and\nis mainly collective in nature makes it more sensitive to illegal appropriation\nby outsiders. Let us consider in this respect the case of oral tradition. Under\nthe cover term \u201coral tradition\u201d indigenous peoples include not only what\nwe usually name as myths, legends, songs, and the like, but also other,\nperhaps \u201cmore practical\u201d knowledge that is enacted and transmitted\norally as the knowledge related to biodiversity, forest conservation or\nnatural medicine. Now, to the extent that language is the main vehicle\nof intangible cultural heritage, any knowledge, practice or expression is\ncoded in language and hence part of oral tradition. Therefore, protecting\nintangible cultural heritage as collective property implies protecting\nlanguage firstly through revitalisation, in case it is being threatened by a\ndominant official language; secondly, through its active and creative use in\nthe education of indigenous peoples; and thirdly, through the construction\nof a legal framework that enables speakers of indigenous languages and\nowners of intangible cultural heritage to control the dissemination of any\nlinguistically coded element of their cultural heritage.\nThree sensitive issues have been identified in relation to the management\nof orality and literacy of indigenous languages and intangible cultural\nheritage in Ecuador. The first issue addresses the tension between collective\nand individual rights in terms of property. While property in general may\nbe owned by a person or by a group of people, intangible cultural heritage\nis always owned by a group even if it can be preserved and transmitted\nindividually. Take, for example, the case of the last medicine-man\nof an indigenous Amazonian group: as an individual he possesses a\nrich knowledge about the use of plants and herbs, but his knowledge is\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 115 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 116 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nnot his personal property but the product of the collective experience of\nhis people in their century-long coexistence with the tropical forest; the\nfact that in principle the last medicine-man can transmit his medicinal\nknowledge through language practically to anybody poses a problem to\nthe distribution of such knowledge and the property of it in relation to his\npeople.\nThe second controversial issue has to do with the use of language\nas part of intangible cultural heritage. In recent years the video and\naudio recording of speech events has become the standard of language\ndocumentation (Himmelmann 2006: 9). Over a hundred documentation\nprojects all over the world have been generously supported by research\ninstitutes and non-governmental organisations. Documenting linguistic\ndiversity seeks to preserve languages for posterity in a context in which\nhalf of today\u2019s 6,500 languages will be extinct in the next hundred years\n(Crystal 1996; Bradley and Bradley 2002). The idea of preserving linguistic\ndiversity as an expression of our species is certainly valuable, but it is\nless so when the great majority of documentation projects are focused on\narchiving only, i.e. without a view to mobilising outcomes for the survival\nof languages and cultures. The ethical question posed here is about the\nuse of archiving when not accompanied by practical efforts to eradicate\nthe threats of language extinction. The use of language documentation is\nclear when viewed from the perspective of linguists and anthropologists\nor even from that of governmental agencies concerned with positioning\nthe nation-state in the multicultural market. However, when seen\nthrough the lens of speakers themselves, the relevance and practicality\nof language documentation becomes blurred by other more important\nmatters concerning their physical and cultural survival. It is certain\nthat obtaining informed consent of the speech community rather than\nindividuals and sharing views of documentation with a larger audience\ncan help to get the meaning through, but still it is not enough. Language\ndetached from culture and culture detached from physical survival\nlack sense for speakers as human beings. In countries like Ecuador, the\nsocioeconomic situation forces indigenous speakers to abandon their\nnative language for Spanish and leave their cultural heritage behind. It is\nsimply a matter of survival. From this perspective, the only way to carry\nout documentation as part of intangible cultural heritage and education is\nto assume an integral view of linguistic rights as part of economic, social\nand cultural rights.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 116 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 117\nThe third issue involves the distribution of documentation outcomes.\nIf documentation outcomes must serve the social, economic and cultural\npromotion of indigenous peoples, then indigenous peoples must be the\nfirst users of those outcomes. On these grounds, it is essential to discuss\nwith speech communities more practical ways to make outcomes of\ndocumentation easily accessible to them. It is useless, for example, to\nsimply return digital copies of audiovisual material to the communities\nif they do not have electricity or DVD players or personal computers.\nSimilarly useless is the return of copies of scientific papers, books or\ndissertations in languages unknown to speakers or about topics of little\nuse to the promotion of their languages in education. From this perspective,\na valuable descriptive grammar about an endangered language written\nin English with all the linguistic jargon becomes useless for teachers of\na bilingual education school who are in urgent need of a basic grammar\nin their own language. The same criterion is valid for any documentation\nof cultural heritage, which is supposed to serve the community first\nand foremost. The other side of the documentation outcomes involves\noutsiders, i.e. individuals or groups who are neither speakers of indigenous\nlanguages nor owners of their cultural heritage. In Ecuador, outsiders\ncan be city dwellers who speak the dominant language or governmental\nagencies of culture, but also national and international scholars who make\nuse of documentation outcomes for writing their papers and scientific\nreports. Here the question is not the level of accessibility for outsiders but\nrather who establishes those levels and if they are established jointly with\nthe community. It is also a question of where the outcomes are deposited\nand what the privacy policy of the depository is. It has often been the case\nthat products of language documentation are deposited with individuals\ninstead of institutions. In other cases depository institutions are abroad\nand therefore not easily accessible to communities that want to make use\nof documentation outcomes. Moreover, accessibility levels have too often\nbeen determined without consultation with indigenous leaders, thereby\ndisregarding the collective character of cultural heritage.\nThe above discussion does not cover all the issues concerning the\nmanagement of documentation outcomes but suffices to give us an idea of\nhow thorny the questions may be, in particular when customary practices\ninvolve property rights from a purely economic and individual perspective.\nTherefore, a legal framework is necessary which addresses these issues, in\nparticular the individual\/collective nature of rights in relation to intangible\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 117 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 118 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\ncultural heritage and language, the accessibility of outcomes for insiders\nand the limits of accessibility for outsiders.\nOrality and literacy in indigenous cultures:\nperspectives and challenges\nIt is often stated that the world\u2019s linguistic diversity will disappear in\nthe next centuries as a result of globalisation (Nettle and Romaine 2000;\nMufwene 2002). This admonitory statement, however, disregards a fact\nwidely attested in all continents: the ethnic resurgence of groups so far\nsilent or invisible which now choose to speak up and claim their own\nidentity and culture. This ethnic resurgence is supported in many cases\nby developments in national and international legislation. Today, cultural\nand linguistic diversity is as important as biological diversity because it is\nseen as the outcome of thousands of years of species adaptation. Cultural\nand linguistic diversity is therefore an asset for societies in the world\u2019s\nmulticultural market and explains why states that previously claimed\ncultural and linguistic homogeneity now promote cultural and linguistic\nrights. This is the case of Ecuador and of many other Latin American\ncountries, in which the state has assumed a role of protector of rights and\npromoter of cultural diversity in a context of ethnic resurgence and along\nwith a new politics of identity.\nBecause most ethnic groups have been excluded for centuries from the\nsociopolitical developments of nation-states, their cultures have remained\ninfluenced by the dominant culture and yet outside the formal schooling\nsystem. In this context, the entry of ethnic groups to literacy took place\nonly in the second half of the twentieth century. In Ecuador, after twenty\nyears of intercultural bilingual education, indigenous languages and\ncultures remain predominantly oral. But instead of being an obstacle to\nthe revitalisation of indigenous languages and cultures, orality represents\nan unending source of knowledge that should be profited from. The\nquestion is two-fold: on the one hand, how to promote orality without\ndenying indigenous speakers access to literacy; on the other, how to\nprotect intangible cultural heritage of indigenous peoples in ways that\nprevent its folklorisation and commoditisation by outsiders. The answer to\nboth questions lies in the proposals discussed here. One is a new model of\nintercultural bilingual education that takes orality as a point of departure\nfor the development of literacy and makes extensive use of available ICTs\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 118 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 6. Ecuador\u2019s Indigenous Cultures 119\nin order to provide students with socially relevant material and culturally\ncontextualised learning. The other is the safeguarding of intangible cultural\nheritage as part of the enforcement of social, economic and cultural rights of\nethnic groups, respecting their property rights from a collective rather than\nindividual perspective, providing them with easy access to documentation\noutcomes, and consulting them throughout the process of identification,\ninventory and documentation of their languages and cultural heritages so\nas to avoid paternalistic practices. Policy makers, governmental agencies,\nnon-governmental organisations, research institutes and scholars must\nrealise that talk about endangered languages and cultures goes beyond\nlanguages and cultures and involves human beings. Only this realisation\nshall lead us to recognise the multifaceted nature of endangered languages\nand cultures and to make effective contributions to their survival rather\nthan remain silent witnesses of their extinction.\nReferences\nAndrade Pallares, Carlos, Kwatupama Sapara.

From Shrine to Stage: A Personal Account\nof the Challenges of Archiving the\nTejaji Ballad of Rajasthan\nMadan Meena\nThe story of Tejaji\nTejaji is a snake deity widely revered by the agrarian community throughout\nRajasthan, parts of Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. According to popular\nbelief, he was born in the village of Kharnal of Nagaur district (historically\nknown as Marwar state) of Rajasthan during the tenth century AD1 probably\nto a Jat (community) family. The story goes that he was married very early\nas an infant and was unaware of the fact until he grew to adolescence. One\nday, goaded by his sister-in-law, he learnt about his married status and\nso resolved to visit his wife\u2019s village and bring her home. Before doing\nso he first went to his sister\u2019s village to bring her back and then left to\ncollect his wife. He encountered many bad omens as he started his journey\nbut continued undeterred. It is this interesting journey to his wife\u2019s village\nand his encounter with the snake to whom he gives his life that form the\ncontent of the sung Tejaji Ballad.\nThe Tejaji Ballad\nThe Tejaji Ballad occupies an important part of the sung oral tradition in\nRajasthan.2 The singers are non-professionals who have built up expertise\n1 See Thakur Deshraj (2002: 305).\n2 The tradition of Tejaji singing has traveled to the adjoining states of Madhya Pradesh and\nDOI: 10.111647\/OBP.0032.08.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 121 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 122 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nthrough years of continuous performances at Tejaji shrines. The tradition\nis not caste- or community-specific: the singers and devotees come from all\nsections of society, small Tejaji shrines exist in every village and different\nfairs and festivals mark the importance of the deity. During the Tejaji\nfair, the performance of the ballad is the most important of all the rituals\nperformed at the shrine. A separate style of Tejaji performance also exists\nin the region in the form of khel3 enacted on stage as a serial drama over\nseveral nights, but this has almost died out.\nIn its original form, men come together at night to sing the Tejaji Ballad\nduring the monsoon months. This period used to be spread over two\nmonths but increasingly the performances only begin close to the main\nfestival of Teja-Dashmi which marks the end of the season.\nThe aim of the performance of the ballad is to induce the spirit of Tejaji\nto enter the priest (Bhopa)4 so that he can exorcise snake poison from man or\nbeast. The possibility of encountering snakes is highest during the monsoon\nwhen the ballad is sung. The narration of the ballad supports a strong belief\nthat whoever ties a thread in the name of Tejaji will survive the snakebite.\nTraditionally, the singers are called upon to perform whenever an urgent\ncase of snakebite arises or when an offering is made for the fulfillment\nof a wish. The ballad symbolises reverence to the deity for life. Thus the\nperformers, performance and the Bhopa are strictly related to the shrine of\nTejaji and these cannot be separated.\nTraditionally, the singing of the Tejaji Ballad takes place at the village\nshrine with the singers and instrumental players sitting on the ground facing\neach other in a circle. In the majority of modern performances, two men sing\nthe ballad accompanied by a few others. In one village, people remembered\ngroups of up to fifty men facing each other. One initiates the basic lines\nof the ballad and the other repeats them. The accompanying musical\ninstruments used are dholak,5 algoza,6 manjira7 and also hand clapping (Figure\n1). The recordings hosted by the World Oral Literature Project, and made in\nGujarat through continuous migrations of the Raika (shepherd) community in search\nof pastoral lands. The Raikas are devotees of Tejaji and they sing the ballad in great\nreverence.\n3 These are types of dramas enacted in villages at nights during the festive time. Also\ncalled nautanki in north Rajasthan.\n4 A priest of the shrine who is also in charge of it.

Photograph by Madan Meena, 2010.\nIconography\nThe Tejaji Ballad illustrates the sacrificial deed of Tejaji. It establishes his\nideal human character in keeping his promise. During the narrative of the\nballad, the character Tejaji loses his life in obedience to his promise to a\nsnake whilst on a journey to bring his wife home. The snake bites him on the\ntongue as this is the only place still unbloodied after his heroic adventures.\nThe ballad is infused with local references to make it more relevant to the\npresent-day life of the people, for example the singers mention a flood in\nthe Kali Sind river when Tejaji goes on a pilgrimage to Badrinath shrine.\nGeographically, Badrinath lies in the Himalayas (north India), while Kali\nSind is a local river in the Hadoti region.8\nThe popular image of Tejaji is as a warrior sitting on a mare holding a\nspear in his hand and with the snake climbing up to bite him (see Figure 3).\nThis image is found in calendars, cassette covers, shrine paintings, and in\nstone reliefs.9 In the village of Sureli in Tonk district, the Bhopa imitates the\n8 The region derives its name from Hada Rajputs who settled in the region in the twelfth\ncentury and dominated the area for several centuries thereafter. At one time, the\nHada-ruled state of Bundi encompassed the present-day districts of Baran, Bundi, Kota,\nand Jhalawar. See James Tod (2002: 355).

I was able to video-record this\nmoment for the archives but was not able to get a good sound recording\nbecause of extraneous noises and the general chaos.\nA day prior to the eve of Teja-Dashmi, the Bhopa moves in a procession\nsitting on a mare holding the snake round his neck. The next day he allows\nthe snake to bite him on his tongue. For a moment after the snake bites\nhe appears to lose consciousness but is brought back to life by the crowd\nsinging Tejaji songs. At the end of the festival, in the evening, the snake\nis released into its hole. The Bhopa who performs this is quite old and his\nsuccessors may not be able to follow it in future. This performance is a\nunique enactment in the whole of Rajasthan.\nFigure 3. Iconic image of Tejaji represented in a painting. Painted by\nGopal Soni, Bundi.

In later\nimages (e.g. the Tejaji shrine at Balchandpara in Bundi), the detail is refined. These\nimages of Tejaji are washed regularly and decorated with colorful foil and sindoor\n(vermillion) (Bharucha, 2003, for this and all other glossary terms) on dasse, i.e. on the\ntenth day of every Hindu Bhadwa month.\n10 T he festival of Teja-Dashmi falls on tenth day of Bhadwa Hindu month i.e. in September.\nThe day is marked with celebrations at Tejaji\u2019s shrine, the cutting of the threads, and a\nnumber of important fairs. People fast on that day (they eat once in the evening), offer\nprasad (offerings) and hoist flags at the shrines.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 124 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 7. From Shrine to Stage 125\nThe project\nDuring the current project, the full twenty hours of the Tejaji Ballad were\nrecorded, transcribed into the local Hadoti language, and translated into\nHindi and English as part of fieldwork supported by the World Oral\nLiterature Project. The final objective was to publish a book along with\nan audio DVD, which were freely distributed these among the singers,\nvillagers, schools and libraries in the area. This will help in preserving\nthe ballad for future generations.\nThe main singers in my recordings are of the Mali11 community of\nThikarda12 village (Figure 5) situated near Bundi town in the Hadoti\nregion. The recordings were made during the monsoon season in 2010\nat the local Tejaji shine outside the village, and at night to avoid external\ndisturbances. Though the ballad can be sung at any part of the day when\nthe need arises to invoke the spirit of Tejaji, it is usually sung at night-\nlong jagarans.13 The singers and the instrumental players were mostly in\ntheir late fifties and sixties. The young generation was generally absent\nfrom the jagarans, as with easy availability of other entertainment options\nthey are not interested in these traditional performances. Recording the\ncomplete ballad took six night-long sessions spread over two months. The\nmusicians cannot sing on consecutive nights as they are too exhausted\nand it was always a challenge to fix up the next recording session and to\ncollect the same group of performers.\n11 The Mali community are commonly recognised as gardeners in the whole of north India.\nTwo main sub-castes of Mali exist in Rajasthan according to the interviews with the\nThikarda Mali: those who are involved in the cultivation of flowers for the shrines and\ntemples are called Phool-Mali, and those involved in agricultural practices and vegetable\ncultivation are called the Gheevar Mali. The Mali of Thikarda village are Gheevar Mali\nwho have small land holdings (one acre on average) on which they grow vegetables and\nsupply them to nearby Bundi town.\n12 The village Thikarda is situated ten kilometers from Bundi across the hills to the north.\nAt one time it was a part of Bundi state. Today it has a population of some 5,000 people,\nmainly of the Mali community, followed by Kumhars (potters), Meghwals and Rajputs.\n13 Jagarans are all-night singing sessions where devotees gather at the shrine to listen to the\nmusicians who sing devotional songs. The purpose of the Jagrans is to invoke the deity.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 125 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 126 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nFigure 5 T ejaji singers of the Mali community at village Thikarda. Photograph\nby Madan Meena, 2010.\nAlongside Thikarda village, recordings were made in some twenty-four\nother villages in the Hadoti region and adjoining areas in order to get a\nsense of the variations and nuances in styles.\nChallenges of recording\nIn many villages, the singing is so endangered that it only happened\nbecause I was commissioning it. The singers are now limiting its\nperformance to around the main festival of Teja-Dashmi. The quality of\nthe recordings was affected by the fact that instruments needed repair\nand vocalists were out of practice.\nThe performers do not think of themselves as individuals and do not like\nto be singled out by name. They see themselves as being interchangeable\nand as part of a performance. This was a challenge for recording, as\nI wanted the same musicians each time to maintain continuity for\narchiving purposes but they did not see this as important.\nI was trying to record a full version of a twenty-hour Tejaji Ballad\nspread over several nights in as genuine a context as possible. Thikarda\nvillage is now the only village in which singers are able to perform the\nwhole ballad. Increasingly, sections are sung when a jagaran is called.\nAs snakebites are completely unpredictable it was difficult to be there\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 126 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 7. From Shrine to Stage 127\nwhen a genuine performance was happening, to try to capture and\nunderstand the difference in intensity of performance between one\ncalled when a life was at stake, and one called for archiving purposes. I\nwas at a shrine once when a buffalo was brought with a snake bite and\nit died in front of me.\nOn occasions when someone else had organised the performance I had\nlittle influence over the time and venue and, if there was heavy rain, the\nperformance would be cancelled at the last minute. If the performance\nwas carried out, the spirit might not come for several hours and it was\nhard to keep the musicians going and for myself to stay awake through\nthe recording session. The most successful recording sessions in terms\nof sound quality were those which I commissioned myself although the\nauthenticity was compromised.\nI recorded on thirty-six nights out of sixty in August and September\n2010. For a genuine performance, a jagaran has to be called and a feast\nthrown.14 This involves ghee and puja15 material as well as beedis16 and\nendless cups of tea for the musicians and the audience. At one recording,\nI provided refreshments for one hundred people (Figure 6). This was\nnot the norm, however, and the problem was to attract an audience. In\nsuch performances a local audience is necessary as they are the real\npatrons. They boost the performers by responding to the music and this\ninteraction becomes part of the performance. The singer and musicians\nwould sing for thirty minutes to an hour with intermediate breaks\nfor smoking, chewing tobacco and drinking tea. The performance\nwas exhausting and therefore the instrument players took turns, but\nthese supporting players tended to fall asleep after being tired from\nagriculture work. This wasted valuable time on many occasions as I was\ntrying to keep the same performers throughout the recordings for the\nintegrity of the archive. At the end of a session, they would have to be\nshaken awake.\n14 All the recordings were carried out at Tejaji\u2019s shrines by organising jagarans and feasts\nin honour of the deity. This was in order to maintain originality and the context of the\ntradition.\n15 Offering to the deity.\n16 Locally made cigarette by stuffing tobacco into a leaf pipe.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 127 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 128 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nFigure 6. Thikarda singers having a feast of daal-baati17 and churma18 after\nthe jagaran. Photograph by Madan Meena, 2010.\nThe performance is traditionally carried out until the spirit of Tejaji enters\nthe Bhopa. However, the spirit often would not come until 4:00am and the\nsingers had to keep going in turns until it happened. Once the Bhopa\u2019s body\nis possessed by the spirit of the deity, his voice and behaviour change and\nhe acts as the deity himself, and addresses the problems of the devotees. At\none village called Nayagaon near Bundi, because of the many hours that\nhad passed and the spirit had not come, all the musicians fell asleep and\nI had to give up for the night.\nAnother challenge was to collect the musicians in the first place. If a\njagaran is called they have to come, but I would always have to wait two or\nthree hours each time to gather them at the shrine despite all prior contacts\nand invitations having been made. If it rained heavily, the event would be\ncancelled or moved inside where recording became impossible because of\nsound resonance and beedi smoke.\nTo record at one of the villages inhabited by the Kanjar community,\nnotorious for its illegal activities and crime, I had to take a police escort.\nEveryone in the village was drunk, including the instrumental players.\nBut the performance turned out to be fabulous and was participated in by\nwomen dancers, which I had not seen before (Figure 7). The performers\n17 Rajasthani village dish of wheat balls made and cooked in a cow-dung fire and eaten\nbroken up and mixed with ghee and daal.\n18 Sweetened mixture of crushed baati served with daal-baati.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 128 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 7. From Shrine to Stage 129\nmoved in a colourful procession, which went round the village the whole\nnight finally culminating in a frenzied gathering at the Tejaji shrine in the\nmorning. During the performance it was not just one Bhopa, but many who\nall took turns to be possessed by local deities. Some of the performers had\npassed out by the morning from their excesses.\nFigure 7. Kanjar women dancing to the tune of the Tejaji Ballad. Photograph\nby Madan Meena, 2010.\nHaving worked with the more sober Thikarda singers last year, I was able\nto gain their confidence. It is not traditional to pay them individually but\nto donate something for the shrine. In return for the six recording sessions,\nthe shrine has new paintings and a cement floor outside, on which villagers\ncan perform under a tree. The village has decided that it wants money\ntowards a roof for the new cement floor and I have promised Rs. 20,000.19\nAt the end of the recordings during the Teja-Dashmi mela (local fair)\nI called the performers and honoured each with a flower garland and a\ndhoti.20 They appeared to be satisfied, but with other groups it was different.\nSome groups assumed that I was going to make money out of the recordings\nand therefore demanded a high fee and travel expenses. Others wanted me\nto publish cassettes and CDs for them in return for playing. Very few could\n19 I ndian Rupee.\n20 Loin cloth worn by men.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 129 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 130 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nunderstand the concept of the recordings being for academic and archiving\npurposes.\nDuring recording sessions at many places, the singers could not be\nmotivated to sing without the installation of a sound system. They have\nbecome so accustomed to microphones that the pitch and volume at which\nthey sing has considerably reduced. They feel uncomfortable singing\nwithout the microphones. Impractically, they especially like to listen to\nthemselves during the performance by tilting one of the loudspeakers\ntowards themselves. With the use of microphones and amplifiers, the\nsingers do not have to exert themselves. The empathy between the singer\nand the instrumental players is lost. An external person controls the blend\nand volume of the ballad by monitoring and adjusting the input signal\nlevels whereas in the absence of any amplifying equipment, the singers and\nplayers have to listen to each other and adjust their volume accordingly.\nFor authentic recordings, the loudspeakers and amplifiers were a big\nhurdle (Figures 8 and 9). They generate lots of echo and extra sound in\nthe background. Also the spontaneity is not present in such microphone-\nsupported performances. In such situations, I cancelled my recordings so\nas not to disturb the jagaran called by the villagers.\nFigures 8 and 9. Singers holding the microphone, and an amplifier installed\non a cart. Photograph by Madan Meena, 2010.\nFrom shrine to stage\nOver the years, a shift in tradition has lead to stage performances. One\nreason for this is the popularity of religious Hindu bhajan21 performances\non stage. The Tejaji singers are evolving their style accordingly. They are\n21 Generic term for devotional song.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 130 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 7. From Shrine to Stage 131\nmoving out from the confines of the community to larger prominence,\nseeking audiences despite the challenge of influences from outside. This\ntype of performance was not worth recording for the purposes of my\nproject but it is a very important trend and will lead to the loss of genuine\nperformances and opportunities to record in the future.\nThe repertoire is losing its strength on stage. When the group sings the\nTejaji Ballad at a village shrine, it is sung in consecutive mode, and the\nstory progresses in linear manner. On stage, multiple groups participate\nand the time duration is short, thus only a popular part of the ballad is\nsung. The audience is very diverse, and the aspect of entertainment is more\nimportant than belief. Thus the singers, dancers and electronic equipment\nand instruments dramatise the performance: the objective is shifting from\nhonouring the deity to gathering accolades of the audience.\nOne reason for the evolution of a stage style is the desire of the\nmiddle class development lobby to provide a platform for the dying\nrural traditions. Musicians are invited to urban or even international\nplatforms and encouraged to devise a short programme that will fit into\nthe constraints of a planned set-piece entertainment. Under the name of\n\u201cHadoti Culture\u201d, the audience is treated to an overblown, overdressed\nBollywood-style parody of the Tejaji tradition with even a female singer\nbacking up the storyteller. There is always a prancing horse dancer and\nusually a man twirling an umbrella. The audience, which probably does\nnot understand the language of the singing, is introduced only to the\nvisual elements. For generations the traditions of the Tejaji Ballad have\nsurvived in the environment of socio-religious beliefs and customs. Only\ntime will tell how far the stage will carry them and in which direction.\nThus from this perspective of rapid changes to the Tejaji Ballad, the\nauthentic traditional style is losing ground. Most of the performers are\naged and the new generation is not interested in learning the tradition.\nThe modern values of education do not support the belief in Tejaji. At the\npresent time, no one who has been to school likes to tie a thread in the\nname of Tejaji if bitten by a snake. He or she will immediately rush to\nthe hospital to get the anti-venom treatment. This is obviously a good\ndevelopment but it means that the old oral tradition is so under threat that\nmy recording may be the last occasion on which the ballad is sung in its\nentirety.\nThe challenges of recording the Tejaji Ballad for archiving purposes, and\nfor offering the ballad in a pure form to the people of Hadoti, have been\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 131 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 132 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nmany and varied but, for the most part, successfully met and personally, it\nhas been a most rewarding experience. As proposed, the twenty hours of the\nballad with Thikarda singers was recorded successfully in its original style\nkeeping in mind the technical archival standards. This project has opened\ndoors to further recordings in other villages as people themselves have\nwelcomed me to record their groups. They are beginning to understand\nthe value of archiving such traditions. Once the singers are recorded they\nare very keen to get a copy of it immediately after the recording. With the\naid of computers and bluetooth devices they download it to their cellphone\nhandsets and mp3 players. I hope that this will help in popularising this\ntradition if not as a belief system then at least as a singing tradition. Thus,\nafter this project the future effort will be to record and archive as many\nTejaji Ballad singing groups as come forward, and to produce on-demand\naudio DVDs for them. The urgency to record the different styles of the\nballad prevalent in different parts of Rajasthan has been very apparent\nduring the project. I plan to concentrate on archiving them with support\nfrom outside or independently.\nThe audio-video and written records of this project will serve as a\nsnapshot of cultural heritage for the future, but will also constitute a\nfossilised archive of a constantly changing important Hadoti oral tradition.\nHopefully this will serve as a model for archiving similar traditions\nprevalent in Rajasthan, which are also on the verge of extinction. Apart\nfrom archiving it, the publication of the book and audio DVD will help in\npromoting its value and importance amongst the younger generation.\nReferences\nBharucha, Rustom, Rajasthan, An Oral History: Conversations with Komal Kothari\n(New Delhi: Penguin Books, 2003).\nDeshraj, Thakur, Jat Ithihas (Delhi: [n. pub.] 2002).\nGovernment of India, Survey of India Maps (India [n.p.]: Government of India, 1998).\nMeena, Madan, Tejaji Gatha (Kota, Rajasthan: Kota Heritage Society, 2012).\nTod, James, Annals & Antiquities of Rajasthan, 2 vols (India: Rupa & Co, 2002).\nOnline Sources\nWorld Oral Literature Project, Madan Meena: Tejaji Gatha collection\n<www.oralliterature.org\/collections\/mmeena001.html>\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 132 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 8.

These include\nMostaert and de Smedt (1929, 1930, 1931), Schr\u00f6der (1952\/1953, 1959, 1964,\n1970), and Schram (2006 [1954\u20131961]). More recently, the diversity of the\nTu nationality has been demonstrated by studies and collections related\nto the Tu living in Tongren County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous\nPrefecture, Qinghai Province (Janhunen et al. 2006, Fried 2009, Fried 2010);\nand Shaowa Tu Autonomous Township, Zhuoni (Janhunen et al. 2007). In\naddition there have been studies focusing on the Huzhu and Tianzhu Tu\n(Ha and Stuart 2006, 2008, Ha 2007, Faehndrich 2007); and the Mangghuer\nof Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province (Slater 2003).\nAuthorship in Chinese by PRC writers on the Tu, with the Tu imagined\nas a single homogeneous ethnicity, has generally focused on history and\norigins using historical Chinese-language texts, with few in-depth local\nstudies utilising community elders\u2019 knowledge. This tendency to write Tu\nhistory using written texts that are often unclear partly explains multiple,\ncompeting interpretations. These writings generally make a connection\nwith the Tuyuhun and Xianbei, who are represented as Tu ancestors (L\u00fc\n2002, Hu 2010), or arguments are presented that the Tu are descended\nfrom Mongol troops who came to the current Qinghai-Gansu area during\nthe time of the Mongol conquests, the Shatuo,3 and Han Chinese (Li 2004,\nLi and Li 2005). In contrast, the oral history documentation project of\nthe Mongghul Ha Clan4 prioritised the value of local oral history as told\nby community elders with the goal of making it available worldwide to\nanyone with an interest, including future generations of Tu people.\nIt is important to note that migrations, intermingling, and identity\ntransformation of nationalities have been frequent in the Qinghai-Gansu\nfrontier region, making it challenging to claim that the Tu ethnicity is\nunambiguously derived from a single ancestral group. Disputes and the\n3 T he Shatuo were a local section of the Ancient Turks (Janhunen, 2006).\n4 Clan refers here to a group sharing a common surname and a common genealogy or\nchronicle.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 134 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 8. Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History Documentation 135\ngeneration of academic papers regarding Monguor origins are likely to\nrobustly continue. This is due in part to the complicated genesis of the\nethnicity of the Tu, and the manner in which the Tu category was created\nin new China. The dearth of material utilising the knowledge of living\nilliterate elders and such materials as local clan chronicles emphasises how\ncontemporary Chinese historiography has so often neglected knowledge\npassed down from generation to generation. Such materials can provide\nvital information and allow for a more nuanced view of ethnic history.\nIn terms of Monguor clan histories, Louis Schram\u2019s work on the\nLiancheng Lu Clan (2006 [1954\u20131961]),5 and Li and Li\u2019s research (2008) are\nnoteworthy in using clan chronicles to examine the history of the ethnicity.\nAs Nietupski notes, Schram \u201cprovides a record of ethnic Monguor clan\nlineage from its own perspective and gives detail about the tusi6 office\nand heritage\u201d (2006: 35). Schram\u2019s work suggests that the Lu Clan is of\nMongol imperial origin. Li and Li\u2019s book (2008), which makes frequent\nuse of Schram, combines local chronicles with historical Chinese language\nmaterials providing further particulars about Mongghul clan origins,\nespecially the two Mongghul Li clans, one of which they claim is of Mongol\norigin and one of Shatuo origin.\nRecording and preserving what living Mongghul elders know of\ntheir own history is an urgent task. They are the last group able to repeat\ngenerationally transmitted knowledge about clan origins, migration routes,\nsettlement areas, important local figures, and clan genealogy, as well as\nmodes of livelihood, relationships local people had with government, and\ncultural expression. In addition, they have a rich orally transmitted repertoire\nof songs, folktales, proverbs, and knowledge of various cultural expressions\nthat are of great importance in illuminating the history of cultural origins,\ninterrelationships, and language studies. The exigency of recording such\ninformation is further emphasised by the realisation that very little of this\nknowledge is being recorded, the heritage-bearers are rapidly passing away,\nand that the younger generations possess little of this knowledge.\nIn recognition of these issues and the value placed on living elders\u2019\nknowledge, we chose the Ha Clan (two authors\u2019 clan) to study, and make\nsuch knowledge publicly available.7\n5 Liancheng Town is located in contemporary Yongdeng County, Gansu Province.\n6 Tusi = Chinese-appointed or inherited-post local officials; \u201chereditary local chief\u201d\n(Nietupski 2006: 30, 33).\n7 The Mongghul Ha Clan consists of the West Ha Clan (Mongghul Ha Clan members from or\nwho moved away from Xihajia (West Ha Clan) Village), and East Ha Clan members, who are\nfrom or previously were from Donghajia (East Ha Clan) Village, Huzhu County, Qinghai.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 135 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 136 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nThe Mongghul Ha Clan is not mentioned as a Mongghul clan in any\nwritten historical sources that we have identified. Is this due to ignorance of\nsuch historical sources, or the claim by many contemporary West Ha Clan\nmembers that \u201cwe were originally not Mongghul\u201d refers to historical fact?\nTo answer these questions and gain further insight into Ha Clan history,\nthe project focused on oral history and family chronicles that survived New\nChina\u2019s chaotic early history.\nThe Mongghul Ha Clan chronicle\nFamily chronicles found in China often provide valuable information\nunrecorded in official history writings. The Hawan Ha Clan chronicle\nconsists of two parts written in Chinese. The first is the Old Chronicle\ncomposed in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu Reign (1875\u20131908) of the\nlate Qing Dynasty.8 The New Chronicle was composed in 1992 and 1993\nas a continuation of the Old Chronicle.9 Two sections of the Old Chronicle\nhave survived. The first is a six-page preface and the second is a forty-eight\npage chronological listing of clan members\u2019 biographies that record birth\nand death dates, place of interments, and very brief life narratives. This\ninformation allows descendants to know where and when visits should be\npaid to their ancestors\u2019 graveyards.\nOriginally a genealogical registry of the clan\u2019s ancestors existed called\nzongnan in the local Chinese dialect, or zong\u2019an in Modern Standard\nChinese. It was, according to clan elders, a large piece of cloth that\ncovered nearly one wall of a room. The clan ancestors\u2019 names were\nwritten and their portraits sketched on the zongnan, which co-existed\nwith family chronicles. The Ha Clan zongnan, the oldest known record\nof the clan and the only copy that existed, was destroyed in 1958 during\nPochu mixin yundong \u201cDestroy Superstition Movement\u201d.10 The New\nChronicle records the following with regard to the zongnan: \u201cWe formerly\nhad a roll of white silk cloth that was more than three meters long and\n1.6 meters wide called zongnan. It featured our ancestors\u2019 sketches.\nAmong them the most prominent was that of Yinxi Taiye\u201d.11 Another\n8 Preface of the Ha Clan\u2019s unpublished Old Chronicle (1892).\n9 Preface of the Ha Clan\u2019s unpublished New Chronicle (1993).\n10 Campaigns engendered by Posijiu \u201cSmash the Four Olds\u201d (old customs, culture, habits, and\nideas) began in 1966 and resulted in widespread destruction of family chronicles in China.\n11 Yinxi refers to the tradition of the emperor bestowing titles and ranks to his subjects on\nthe basis of their immediate ancestors having been high-ranking officials and having\nhonorably served the court. \u201cTaiye\u201d literally refers to one\u2019s great-grandfather; it is also\nan honorific title for an ancestor.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 136 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 8. Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History Documentation 137\nsection of the New Chronicle gives generation names that help clan\nmembers understand relationships to other clan members. Such\nrelationships are of fundamental significance in Mongghul social\nstructure, where social position in the local community is determined by\nthe generation one belongs to. For example, where one should sit at a\nwedding ritual where guests are seated according to their generation, the\norder of the families one visits during the Chinese lunar New Year period,\nterms of address used for family members in the homes visited, and the\norder in which liquor is offered, are determined by generation and age.\nThis unified system of generation names differentiates generations by\nmeans of a word in every clan member\u2019s name. For example, in the names\nof two of the chapter\u2019s authors \u201cHa\u201d is the surname and \u201cMing\u201d indicates\ntheir generation (which is the same). Only the third character in this case\nis unique, \u201czong\u201d and \u201czhu\u201d. This unified system is used both in the West\nand East Ha Clans (Ha 2007).\nFigure 1.

Regarding\nclan origins, the New Chronicle preface reads:\nIn terms of Ha Clan history, the clan originated from Zhuji Street in today\u2019s\nNanjing City. In 1376, two brothers moved to Huangzhong and then soon\nmoved to Halazhigou in Huzhu County. The elder brother settled on the\nwest side of the river, and hence the origin of the West Ha Clan. The younger\nbrother settled on the east side, and hence the origin of the East Ha Clan.13\nThe accounts of Qinghai natives having originated from Nanjing are many\namong both Mongghul and Han and, perhaps, the account of Mongghul\nNanjing origins was created relatively recently (Schram 2006 [1954]:\n125, 164). Such an account is absent from the surviving pages of the Old\nChronicle. In any case, all the Ha Clan consultants interviewed during this\nproject stated that their ancestors originated in Nanjing.\nThe Digital Version of Ha Clan History14 suggests that people with the\nsurname Ha in China descended from two brothers\u2014Hala Buding and\nHala Buda\u2014who were of Karluk\/Geluolu (Halalu) origin and were military\ncommanders of the Oirat Khaan Esen Taiji. Their surname, Ha Baocheng\nwrites, is a phonetic transcription of the first syllable of their own non-\nChinese names (personal communication, 2010).\nIn 1452, the two brothers moved to central China\u2014Zhongyuan\u2014where\nthey became renowned military generals of the Ming (1368\u20131644) court.\nThe surname Ha became first known in China during this period.\nThe son of the elder brother, Hala Buding, later moved from Nanjing\nto Hejian\u2014in today\u2019s Hebei Province\u2014and became the most prominent\nmilitary general in Hejian following his father\u2019s death. The younger brother,\nHala Buda, remained in Nanjing and became a prominent military officer.\n12 Ha Baocheng, an independent Hui scholar living in Beijing, has compiled A Digital\nVersion of Ha Clan History, which he shared with Ha Mingzong. Most of the material\nfrom this collection is available from his website in Online Sources. Ha Baocheng\ncontends that Hui with the surname Ha originated from the Muslim Khanate of Bukhara.\n13 Preface of the Ha Clan\u2019s unpublished New Chronicle (1993).

Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History Documentation 139\nDuring this period the Ha Clan divided into two parts: one moved north\nand lived in Hejian and the other stayed in Nanjing. Ha Baocheng also\nwrote in personal communication to Ha Mingzong that most of those with\nthe surname Ha in today\u2019s Qinghai and Gansu provinces migrated to these\nlocations from Nanjing during the Ming Dynasty.\nIt should be noted that the New Chronicle states that Ha Clan ancestors\nmoved from Nanjing to Qinghai in 1376. Ha Baocheng\u2019s research suggests\nthe Hala brothers came first to Nanjing in 1452, which he states is the\napproximate time of Ha Clan origins in China. There is thus obvious\ndiscrepancy in Ha Baocheng\u2019s findings and the New Chronicle. Ha\nBaocheng also suggests that most Mongghul Ha Clan members in today\u2019s\nQinghai and Gansu were originally Han and later were classified as Tu\nwhen the Chinese government began establishing minority autonomous\nregions in the 1950s and the local government in today\u2019s Huzhu needed\nmore people in the Tu ethnic category in order to establish an autonomous\ncounty in Huzhu.\nThe two villages with the most Ha Clan members in Huzhu County\nare Xihajia Village where, in 2009, there were seventy-eight families (about\n380 people) of whom only two families were from another clan. The second\nvillage is Donghajia where, in 2009, there were forty families (approximately\n220 people) of whom three families were from other clans. Xihajia Village\nresidents with the surname Ha were all classified as Han, while Donghajia\nVillage residents with the surname Ha were all classified as Tu. Ha Clan\nmembers in Hawan Village are also registered as Tu.\nMigration from Huzhu to Tianzhu\nFrom the late nineteenth century when the Gansu frontier was ruled by Ma\nQi (1869\u20131931) and his son, Ma Bufang (1903\u20131975), Xihajia was under the\njurisdiction of Xining Fu, or \u201cXining Administration\u201d.\nPart of the Xihajia Ha Clan moved to Hawan in three phases from 1918\nto 1942. Others moved to Yetu and Dakeshidan villages in Tiantang Town,\nXidatan Township; and Anyuan Town in Tianzhu County.15 The digital\ncollection of information related to these migrations, based on interviews\nwith local clan elders, was a major project focus. The initial migration of\npart of the Xihajia Village Ha Clan occurred in 1918 when Ha Nangsuo\n15 Data collected by Ha Mingzong during his fieldtrips.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 139 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 140 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nmoved his family to Hawan as the result of Ma Qi\u2019s efforts to increase\nthe size of his army by forcibly drafting men into his service.16 According\nto Chen (2009: 13), salaries and supplies for his army were originally\nprovided by the Gansu government, but after Ma Qi became increasingly\nautonomous, government support ended and he began collecting money\nand property from the citizenry. Later, when Ma Bufang (known locally\nas Tu Huangdi \u201cLocal King\u201d) came to power, drafting men into the army\nintensified and taxes increased (Li and Li 2005: 302\u2013304).\nAccording to stories told by elders interviewed, Ma Bufang ordered\nMongghul women to stop wearing headdresses and other traditional\nclothing. Those who refused were vilified and sometimes beaten. Elders\nsaid they dared not speak Mongghul within earshot of Ma Bufang soldiers,\nfor fear of punishment. Consultants also said that Ma Bufang conscripted\nlocal carpenters, blacksmiths, and masons because of their specialised\nskills. For example, the interviewee Ha Baode (b. 1939) mentioned\nthat his father, a carpenter fearful of being captured by Ma Bufang\u2019s\nsoldiers, frequently stayed away from home working in such areas as the\ncontemporary Tianzhu County, where Ma Bufang\u2019s influence was less\ngreat. When he had accumulated enough money to build a new house in\nHawan, he moved his family there. Elders also stated boys and men aged\nfifteen to fifty were forced into Ma Bufang\u2019s army; such conscriptions\nwere implemented two or three times annually, leaving only old people,\nwomen, and children in the village. It was under such circumstances that\nmany Hawan Ha Clan members\u2019 ancestors along with many other people\nfled to Tianzhu and also why many Tianzhu residents speak the Qinghai\nChinese dialect today.\n16 Schram (2006 [1954\u20131961]: 306\u201307) describes nangsuo as an institution originally\ncreated by the Ming court in Huangzhong for local lama chiefs to carry out tasks such\nas \u201cthe granting of a territory, the fixing of a yearly tribute, the recognition of the\nchieftainship of the lama who had brought in the tribe, and of the heritability of that\nchieftainship\u201d.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 140 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 8.

Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History Documentation 143\nThe current situation of the Mongghul Ha Clan\nAs discussed earlier, Mongghul Ha Clan members who are originally\nfrom Huzhu County live in Xihajia and Donghajia villages in Danma\nTown, Huzhu County. In Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Ha Clan\nmembers dwell in Yetu, Hawan, and Dakeshidan villages of Tiantang\nTown, Anyuan Town, Xidatan Township, and Huazangsi Town.\nCommunication between the modern-day Gansu and Qinghai branches\nof the Ha Clan has been intermittent over the years. Several Hawan elders\nhave visited their ancestral home in Xihajia and the clan cemetery. Apart\nfrom a decreasing number of elders, few Ha Clan members understand\nthat less than a century ago, a clan branch moved to Hawan. When asked\nto explain this lack of communication, the answer was typically, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nknow anybody there\u201d.\nSeveral elders in Xihajia Village speak Mongghul while all others speak\nonly the local Chinese dialect. The linguistic situation is very different in\nDonghajia Village where nearly everyone speaks Mongghul. Only a fifteen\nminute walk across a riverbed and a road that leads to Xining separates\nthe two villages, raising the issue of why such a difference in villagers\u2019\nknowledge of Mongghul developed. Local accounts suggest that a Xihajia\nvillager known as Hajia Xiansheng \u201cHa Clan Master\u201d was educated in\nthe Chinese language, thought highly of the importance of Chinese, and\nencouraged fellow villagers to speak and learn this language. Other reasons\nremain unclear for this startling difference in language abilities between\nthe two nearby villages of the same clan.\nHistorically, the inconvenience of travel made the distances separating\nvarious Ha Clan settlements difficult and thus cross-community visits were\nimpractical and communication sporadic. Over the years, differences between\nthese settlements have developed. For example, all Xihajia residents are\nregistered as Han, speak the local Chinese dialect, and follow local Chinese\nmarriage and burial ceremonies, whereas people in Donghajia are registered as\nTu, speak Mongghul, cremate their dead, and sing Mongghul songs at weddings.\nHa Clan people in Hawan, though of Xihajia descent, speak Mongghul, while\nthe generation born around 1990 have varying ability in understanding and\nspeaking Mongghul. Most Hawan Mongghul, in 2011, spoke Chinese more often\nthan Mongghul, no longer wore Mongghul clothing, nor sang in Mongghul, and\ngenerally felt there was little difference between Tu and local Han.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 143 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 144 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nFigure 6.

Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History Documentation 145\nFor the entire West Ha Clan, the Mongghul language is maintained only\nin Hawan Village. The number of Mongghul speakers is decreasing rapidly\nin Hawan because more children go to schools where the only language used\nis Chinese, villagers go to other areas for long periods of the year to work\nwhere Chinese is the lingua franca, and on account of an increasing number\nof marriages with Chinese and Tibetan women who do not speak Mongghul.\nProject approaches\nAn inspiration for undertaking this project was the debate over the issue\nof Tu history. We felt that Mongghul elders had important information\nand we were determined to bring to life and permanently record their\nstories and thoughts as it often differs from texts focusing exclusively\non written sources. We also felt a responsibility to future generations\nof Mongghul youth to provide a record of their ancestors\u2019 memories.\nConsequently, Ha Mingzong and Ha Mingzhu visited Mongghul Ha\nClan members in Xihajia and Donghajia villages in Huzhu; Hawan,\nYetu, and Dakeshidan villages and Huazangsi Town in Tianzhu; and\nAkesu in Xinjiang and made audio and video recordings of interviews.\nThis information was easily copied onto DVDs and VCDs which, as\nGerald Roche et al. comment, fit into \u201cthe video-disc (VCD) era of\ntoday\u201d because almost every village family has a VCD or DVD player\n(2010: 154). Community elders were enthusiastic about the audio-video\ndocumentation of their family stories for posterity.\nLocal reactions\nThe project elicited different points of view among locals. Villagers from\nall the Ha Clan communities that we visited welcomed us: an expression\nof their code of hospitality. After explaining the purpose of our visit, elders\nencouraged us with comments on the importance of the preservation of\nfamily oral history. Elders understand that after they pass away, most\nof their cultural knowledge and memories will also vanish. Clan elders\nalso thought highly of the idea of producing DVDs and VCDs from the\ninterviews to supplement information in the clan chronicles.\nIn contrast, the younger generation was largely indifferent, though they\nwere keenly interested in the recording equipment and the idea of \u201cbeing\non TV\u201d. We sensed considerable scepticism of the project\u2019s importance\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 145 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 146 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nand practicality. For example, on one occasion as Ha Mingzong was\ninterviewing an elder about family history, a man in his twenties joined\nus, took Ha Mingzong\u2019s notebook, looked at his notes, put the notebook\ndown with a bored expression, and asked late in the interview what Ha\nMingzong\u2019s purpose was in collecting such information. He added that\nsuch information did not enhance skills learnt at school and was not helpful\nin finding employment. When Ha Mingzong replied that he thought that\ncultural preservation was important, this man asked why Ha Mingzong,\nwho was studying abroad, would choose to study his own people when\nhe had the chance to learn things that could not be acquired at home and\nbesides, he added, many local Mongghul would probably always know\nmore about themselves than he would.\nHa Mingzong and Ha Mingzhu\u2019s family and relatives generally did\nnot understand why they were involved in such projects that focused\non an intensely impoverished past and present reality that many people\nspend a lifetime trying to escape. Such reactions and attitudes reflect a\nconcern that activity should deliver a monetary reward quickly: cultural\ndocumentation is not seen as providing financial benefit.\nProject outcome\nHa\u2019s Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History (2010) was based on oral interviews\nand contributes to the study of Mongghul history by presenting a digital,\noral history of the Mongghul Ha Clan. Ha Clan elders surprised us by\nsuggesting a possible origin of the Mongghul Ha Clan from Nanjing in\nsouth China. The project also resulted in a transcribed, translated, and\nglossed interview conducted with Ha Shenglin (Appendix 1) that gives\ninformation on family history, childhood, clan migration, and religious\nbeliefs and thus has historical, ethnographic, and ethnolinguistic value,\ngiven the dearth of such content in both written and oral texts.\nSelected interviews were transcribed using the Transcriber program\nthat allows preservation and presentation of both the audio file and the\ntranscription, allowing for the oral text to be presented simultaneously\nwith the corresponding transcription. This permits readers to follow the\nexact transcription while listening to the recording. A screenshot of such\ntranscriptions may be seen in Appendix 2.\nDVDs and VCDs were produced from interviews and activities filmed,\nand given to community members, including the interviewees, who\nreceived not only their own interviews, but also interviews from other Ha\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 146 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 8.

These compact discs hold both images and voices, preserving\nmemories of people, places, and a certain time in history, providing clan\nmembers with heretofore unknown information, strengthening a sense\nof clan unity, and providing locally a unique record of Ha Clan members\nacross Ha Clan communities. These were all major project goals.17\nA participatory approach to cultural documentation was used,\nprioritising the value of local oral history as related by community elders,\nmaking it available worldwide to anyone interested and with an Internet\nconnection. By digitally documenting and presenting the oral history\nof a relatively large Mongghul clan living across an extended area, new\nhistorical insights into Tu history became available. This is obvious in the\ndeath of Ha Shenglin. At present, no one in his immediate family knows\nthe details of his father\u2019s and grandfathers\u2019 lives; information that was\nrecorded by Ha Mingzong is now available.\nThe lives of contemporary Tu youth are increasingly influenced by\nimages of a privileged life lived by China\u2019s elite and in the West, and\nmodern global pop culture such as Korean soap operas that have been\npopularised through the ubiquity of television, compact video discs, and\nthe Internet. There is extreme poverty in some of the most traditional\nMongghul communities, evident through lack of access to basic health\ncare and resources that would pay for such care, clothing that is plain\nand simple, and an education system that is dramatically inferior to that\navailable in such urban centres as Xining and Lanzhou. Knowledge of oral\nhistory and Mongghul songs, wearing Mongghul clothing, and a profound\nknowledge of local Mongghul history do not give most Mongghul youth a\nsense of belonging to a glittery attractive global pop culture. It is the latter\nto which they aspire: to be able to dance, sing, and dress like pop icons, and\nenjoy an affluent life.\nHowever, as the decades pass and people\u2019s lives continue to improve\neconomically and become increasingly synonymous with global urban\nculture, future Mongghul generations may search for their roots in an effort\nto distinguish themselves from much of the rest of humanity. To conclude,\nwe offer this account by Ha Mingzong:\nI was born and raised in Hawan Village, a Mongghul village, which was\nsurrounded by Chinese speaking Han, Hui, and Tibetans. All villagers in\nHawan speak Chinese and, in the late 1990s, all could also speak Mongghul.\n17 Relevant recordings of Ha Clan oral history are available on the World Oral Literature\nProject website, Ha Mingzong: Mongghul Ha Clan Oral History (see Online Sources).\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 147 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM 148 Oral Literature in the Digital Age\nVillagers switched between languages when they talked to each other.\nI lived in the village during the first fifteen years of my life and never heard\na fellow villager sing in Mongghul.\nI attended schools where classes were taught in Chinese, and where\nHan, Hui, Tibetan, and Mongghul students and teachers all spoke Chinese.\nRaised in such an environment led me to believe there were no appreciable\ndifferences between local Chinese, Tibetans, and my Mongghul community,\nother than I spoke an additional language, since most local Tibetans in\nTianzhu only spoke Chinese. It never occurred to me that there was a gap in\nour thinking and behaviour.\nThis attitude changed in 2002 when, at the age of sixteen, I enrolled\nin the ETP (English Training Program) at Qinghai Normal University, a\nprogramme initiated in 1997. I was the lone non-Tibetan in a class of students\nfrom Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and the Tibet Autonomous Region.\nI quickly realised that I was different from my Tibetan classmates for they\nall spoke languages I did not understand. Some classmates thought I was\na Han Chinese teenager who happened to speak Mongghul. I was singled\nout for a long time. A part of me felt proud that I was different, but I was\nnot proud of knowing little about Mongghul culture. There were occasions\nwhen we were asked to sing traditional songs and I was put in an awkward\nsituation because I could not sing any Mongghul songs, unlike my Tibetan\nfriends, many of whom knew many traditional songs.\nI then wished to know more about Mongghul culture. That was why\nI was very pleased when I was introduced to an older Mongghul folk\nresearcher and started doing cultural preservation projects. I wanted to\nlearn more about my culture in the process. And I did. I borrowed CDs\nand VCDs of recorded Mongghul folk songs and learned them. I also began\ndigitally documenting Mongghul folklore from many Mongghul villages\nand distributing the materials back to the local communities, including my\nown, where such recordings sometimes brought tears to the eyes of old\npeople who dearly appreciated them and the memories they resurrected\nafter having been surrounded by pop music for years.\nBased on my experience, it is important to know a great deal about\nMongghul culture in order to be proud of being Mongghul, because this\nbrings knowledge about what there is to be proud of, which leads to\nconfidence in being Mongghul. Time spent studying Mongghul culture and\nhistory is solely up to the individual; it is not taught in any schools.\nMy experience in cultural preservation has allowed me to discover my\npeople and, in so doing, I have more fully discovered myself: a road less\ntravelled that has already taken me much farther than I ever expected.\nArchiving Orality FINAL.indd 148 5\/13\/13 10:04 AM "}
