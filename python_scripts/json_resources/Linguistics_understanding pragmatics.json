Introduction\nAN ILLUSTRATIVE ANECDOTE ON WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT\nIn 1982 I started my field research on the language and culture of the Trobriand\nIslanders in Papua New Guinea. Here is my record of an early experience there:\nEvery morning after I had gotten up and brushed my teeth, I would grab my towel and\nthe little box that contained my soap, shampoo, hair brush and other articles we West-\nEuropeans think to be absolutely necessary for having a bath and walked through the\nvillage to the path that leads to a fresh water grotto, about a ten-minute walk into the\nbush southeast of Tauwema. Although everyone could infer from the things I carried\nwhere I was going, and although all the villagers knew after some time that this was\npart of my morning routine, people always asked me in the village or on the path to the\ngrotto Ambe? \u2013 \u201cWhere?\u201d \u2013 implying \u201cWhere are you going to?\u201d At first I reacted with\na smile and answered with the name of the grotto: Bugei. However, after some weeks\n\u2013 having made some progress in my language acquisition, I responded somewhat\nimpatiently by either waving with my towel to the people who asked this (for me then\nrather silly) question or by simply answering O, kunukwali, bala Bugei makala yumyam\n\u2013 \u201cOh, you know, I will go (to the) Bugei like every day\u201d. After having responded to this\nquestion in this way for a few days, Weyei \u2013 my neighbor and one of my best informants\nand friends \u2013 approached me and told me that I should always answer this question as\nexactly as possible. Thus, after some further progress in learning the language I could\nreact to the question Ambe? in the appropriate Trobriand way, answering for example:\nBala bakakaya baka\u2019ita basisu bapaisewa \u2013 \u201cI will go, I will have a bath, I will return, I\nwill stay (in the village), I will work\u201d.\nWith Weyei\u2019s help I came to understand that this question was in fact a greeting\nformula. People who meet in the Trobriands and who want to indicate that they care\nfor each other do not use greeting formulae ... such as Bwena kaukwa \u2013 \u201cgood morning\u201d,\nbut instead ask each other where they are going. This question is always answered as\ntruthfully and as comprehensively as possible (as in the example given). This has a\npractical reason: all paths on Kaile\u2019una Island and most paths on the other islands\nbelonging to the Trobriand group are just small trampled paths that often lead over\nsharp coral rocks where it is quite easy to hurt one\u2019s foot or leg. Also, sometimes the\npaths cross a grove of coconut trees, and it has also happened that people on these\npaths have been rather severely hurt by falling coconuts. Moreover, Trobriand Islanders\nare very much afraid of the kosi. According to their belief the kosi are ghostly spirits of 2 Introduction\ndead persons, who were not properly mourned immediately after their deaths, and\nwho therefore terrify the living. The apparition of a kosi may frighten someone in the\njungle in such a way that they might lose their orientation. Therefore, the answer to\nthis form of greeting functions to secure one\u2019s way and one\u2019s safe arrival at one\u2019s\ndestination. If people do not show up after a certain time at the places mentioned in\ntheir answers to the greeting question, their fellow villagers and friends will look for\nthem. Thus, being greeted with this question is a sign that the community cares for the\nperson. It is a daily routine that serves the function of social bonding. And it is\nconsidered so important, that Trobrianders who are not greeted in this way at least by\ntheir fellow villagers will conclude that they must have committed some serious offense\nagainst the community. A village community that does not greet one of its fellow\nvillagers with this question indicates that it no longer cares for this person. So it was a\ncompletely inappropriate reaction when I \u2013 sometimes quite conceitedly \u2013 smiled\nabout what I first thought to be a silly question. On the contrary, being greeted with\nthis question by the people of Tauwema after only a few days in their village was a first\nsign of their good will and intention to integrate me into the community.1\nThis misunderstanding shows just what this book is about: As a newcomer in the\nTrobriand speech community I hardly knew anything about the conventions, rules\nand regulations with respect to how the Trobriand Islanders use their language Kilivila\nin social interactions, what kind of meanings their words, phrases and sentences\nconvey in what kind of contexts and what kind of functions their use of language\nfulfils in and for its speakers\u2019 communicative behaviour. To gain this kind of knowledge\nrequires the study of the culture-specific forms of the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 language\nuse. In linguistics, the study of language use is called \u2018pragmatics\u2019.2 This book provides\na general introduction into this field.\nPragmatics is the discipline within linguistics that deals with actual language use.\nLanguage use is not only dependent on linguistic, that is grammatical and lexical\nknowledge, but also on cultural, situative and interpersonal context and convention,\nand one of the central aims of pragmatics is to research how context and convention\n\u2013 in their broadest sense \u2013 contribute to meaning and understanding (as the anecdote\npresented above illustrates). Thus, the social and cultural embedding of meaning will\nbe in the focus of this introduction to pragmatics.\nTHE PRAGMATIC TURN!?\nJacob Mey, one of the pioneers and leading figures in modern linguistic pragmatics,\nrefers to this field as \u2018the youngest subdiscipline of the venerable science called\nlinguistics\u2019 (Mey 1994: 3261; see also Mey 1993: 3, 18). Mey and many others see the rise\nof pragmatics and its growing popularity and influence ever since the 1970s at least in\npart as a reaction to the development of American structural linguistics that culminated\nin Noam Chomsky\u2019s proclamation of the \u2018ideal speaker/listener in a completely\nhomogeneous speech community\u2019 (Chomsky 1965: 3) whose language competence\nlinguists describe and analyse on the basis of introspection data. The more the Introduction 3\nChomskyan paradigm gained influence in linguistics, the more linguists gradually\nrealized that the general abstractions of this paradigm neglected the reality of language\nthat is realized in speech produced by speakers in various social, cultural and political\ncontexts with various goals and intentions. Indeed, language is much more than a\ngrammatical algorithm with a lexicon; it is a tool speakers use to interact socially and\ncommunicate with each other. Research in linguistic pragmatics deals with how\nspeakers use their language(s) in various situations and contexts: what speakers do\nwhen they speak and why they do it. In the focus of pragmatics are the actual language\nusers, their communicative behaviour, their world and their point of view, in short,\n\u2018the total human context of [language] use\u2019 (Mey 1994: 3265).\nThis implies that pragmatics serves a kind of \u2018umbrella\u2019 function, as Jan-Ola \u00d6stman\n(1988: 28) put it \u2013 not only for \u2018sociolinguistics ... and other (semi-) hyphenated areas of\nlinguistics\u2019 but also for the other traditional subdisciplines of linguistics. As Mey\n(1994: 3268) wrote: \u2018The problems of pragmatics are not confined to the semantic, the\nsyntactic or the phonological fields, exclusively. Pragmatics ... defines a cluster of\nrelated problems, rather than a strictly delimited area of research\u2019. Pragmatics studies\nlanguage and its meaningful use from the perspective of language users embedded in\ntheir situational, behavioural, cultural, societal and political contexts, using a broad\nvariety of methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches depending on specific\nresearch questions and interests.\nThe issue of interdisciplinarity brings us back to the claim that the 1970s was the\ndecade in which the \u2018pragmatic turn\u2019 in linguistics had its origin. The first volume of\nthe Journal of Pragmatics was published in 1977; John Benjamins started a book series\nwith the title Pragmatics and Beyond in 1979; the International Pragmatics Association\n(IPrA) was founded in 1986; and its journal Pragmatics started under the name IPrA\nPapers in Pragmatics a year later. However, if we look at core domains of the discipline\nwe realize that linguistic pragmatics is relevant for, and has its predecessors in, many\nother disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, ethology, ethnology, sociology and\nthe political sciences.\nIt will be shown in this volume that pragmatics is not only an inherently interdisciplinary\nfield within linguistics, but that it is indeed a \u2018transdiscipline\u2019 that brings together and\ninteracts with a rather broad variety of disciplines within the humanities which share the\nfundamental interest in social action. This interest constitutes a leitmotif for this volume,\nbased on the conviction that \u2018the heart of the pragmatic enterprise [is] the description of\nlanguage as social action\u2019 (Clift et al. 2009: 50).\nThe volume has three central threads that bind the chapters into a complex whole:\n1. Languages are used by their speakers in social interactions; they are first and\nforemost instruments for creating social bonds and accountability relations.\nThe means with which languages create these bonds and relations vary across\nlanguages and cultures.\n2. Speech is part of the context of the situation in which it is produced, language\nhas an essentially pragmatic character and \u2018meaning resides in the pragmatic\nfunction of an utterance\u2019 (Bauman 1992: 147). 4 Introduction\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Speakers of a language follow conventions, rules and regulations in their\nuse of language in social interactions.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The meaning of words, phrases and sentences is conveyed in certain kinds\nof situative contexts.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The speakers\u2019 uses of language fulfil specific functions in and for these\nspeakers\u2019 communicative behaviour.\n3. Pragmatics is the transdiscipline that studies these language- and culture-\nspecific forms of language use.\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK\nIt was pointed out above that linguistic pragmatics is relevant for, and has its\npredecessors in, other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, ethology, ethnology,\nsociology and the political sciences. The chapters of this book are based on this insight.\nEach chapter discusses a selection of core issues of pragmatics that were introduced\ninto the field via these six disciplines. The chapters start with a reference to one or\nmore famous scholars who introduced the issues in focus to pragmatics. Then the\ncontents of these issues and the latest developments within these areas of pragmatics\nare discussed from a cross-linguistic and cross-cultural perspective. At the end of each\nchapter a brief summary is followed by a discussion that picks up the threads provided\nby the anecdote presented at the beginning of this introduction. This discussion aims\nnot only at answering questions raised with this example with respect to cultural\ndifferences in language use and understanding, but also at illustrating how cultural,\nsituative and interpersonal context and culture-specific conventions contribute to\nmeaning in actual language use. Each chapter ends with an exercise/work section and\nsuggestions for further reading. These publications are marked in the list of references\nwith an asterisk (*).\nChapter One Pragmatics and philosophy: What we do when we speak and what\nwe actually mean \u2013 speech act theory and the theory of\nconversational implicature\nThe first chapter looks at the relationship between pragmatics and philosophy. One of\nthe central questions of philosophy is how we interpret our world and our lives as being\nmeaningful, or more generally, how we generate \u2018meaning\u2019. One of the most important\ntools we use to do this is language. And one of the most fascinating fields in linguistics\nis to study how speakers use their language to generate specific meanings in specific\ncontexts. This is the interface where philosophy meets semantics and pragmatics. This\nchapter first deals with the general question What do we do when we speak?, presenting\nthe theory of speech acts put forward by John L. Austin (1962) and John R. Searle\n(1969). In his book How to Do Things With Words Austin developed his general\nconception of speech as action and his classification of speech acts into locutions \u2013 Introduction 5\nwhich have meaning, illocutions \u2013 which have a certain force and perlocutions \u2013 which\nachieve certain effects. Searle systematized Austin\u2019s theory of speech acts. He\nunderstands speaking as performing illocutionary acts which have both a specific\nfunction-indicating element, the illocutionary force and a proposition-indicating\nelement, the propositional content. Speakers perform illocutionary acts in a rule-\ngoverned form of behaviour. This idea is illustrated with Searle\u2019s analysis of the\nillocutionary act of \u2018sincere promising\u2019 and its propositional content conditions. It is\nshown how \u2013 on the basis of such content conditions \u2013 Searle formulates constitutive\nrules for illocutionary acts. Then his classification of speech acts is presented. After a\nbrief discussion of speech act theory from a cross-cultural perspective which shows\nthat research by other scholars refutes possible claims of its universality, this first part\nof the chapter ends with some of Pieter Seuren\u2019s thoughts on speech acts and their\nsocially binding force.\nThe chapter then discusses H. Paul Grice\u2019s theory of implicature and conversational\nmaxims. Grice saw conversation as being guided by a system of expectations \u2013 by\nmaxims \u2013 that are mutually shared by interactants. In his theory of conversational\nimplicature Grice formulates the Cooperative Principle and its subcases \u2013 the four\nmaxims of conversation. First, it is illustrated how these maxims can be violated or\n\u2018flouted\u2019, and then characteristic properties of implicatures are discussed. The chapter\nends with a brief look at Grice\u2019s theory from an anthropological-linguistic point of\nview.\nThis chapter presents philosophical perspectives on language and speech which\nunderstand speech acts as manifestations of language as action that \u2013 driven by\nintentions of speakers \u2013 causes effects and thus has psychological and behavioural\nconsequences in speaker\u2013hearer interactions. It is shown that there is a difference\nbetween the way in which an utterance is used and the meaning that is expressed by\nthis utterance in certain contexts and that speakers may say one thing that has a\nspecific meaning but that also means something else in certain circumstances because\nof certain social conventions that are valid within a specific speech community. And it\nis pointed out that speech acts create accountability relations; thus they can be seen as\na social pact between speaker and hearer which is based on conventions and requires\nsocial competence of the interactants.\nChapter Two P ragmatics and psychology: Deictic reference and gesture\nHow do speakers of different languages refer to objects, persons, places, periods of time\nand even texts or text passages? When speakers do this, they communicate in certain\ncontexts, and these contexts shape our utterances. Natural languages are context-\nbound, and the subdiscipline of linguistics that concerns how languages encode\nfeatures of the context of utterances is called \u2018deixis\u2019. Thus, when someone wants to\nknow what is meant by a sentence like He gave me this book yesterday s/he needs to\nknow who uttered it, when and where, and to which book the speaker refers. Deixis is\nthe name given to the system of indexical forms and means that make these references,\nand, as illustrated by the sentence above, these indexicals are characterized by the fact\nthat their use and meaning is completely context-dependent. The most influential 6 Introduction\ncontribution on the topic of deixis was presented by the German psychologist Karl\nB\u00fchler in the first half of the last century, and ever since B\u00fchler the study of deixis has\nbeen an important research domain within pragmatics. In the first part of this chapter\nthe phenomenon of deixis is presented and discussed. After a general introduction to\nthe topic, a cross-linguistic comparison of language-specific forms of spatial deixis\nillustrates the broad variety of the means languages offer their speakers for this kind of\ndeictic reference. This part of Chapter Two ends with an illustration of the system of\nspatial deixis in the Oceanic language Kilivila.\nThe term deixis is borrowed from the Greek word for pointing or indicating. We not\nonly point with words, but also with gestures. The second part of this chapter deals\nwith the question What forms of gestures do people make and what is their function? At\nthe beginning of the last century the psychologist Wilhelm Wundt laid the foundations\nand set standards for the study of gestures and sign languages in his seminal work\nV\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Wundt\u2019s insights were taken up by psychologists like Adam\nKendon, David McNeill and Susan Golden-Meadow who became pioneers of modern\ngesture research. The second part of this chapter provides a definition of gesture,\npresents the classification of gestures into different types, including co-thought and\nco-speech gestures, and discusses their functions and the interrelationship between\ngesture, language and mind. After a survey of the cross-cultural variation of gestures\nthe chapter ends with a discussion of so-called pragmatic gestures. The study of deixis\nand gesture provides direct evidence for the fact that human interaction is multimodal.\nChapter Three Pragmatics and human ethology: Biological foundations of\ncommunicative behaviour\nGestures are not the only expressive movements that function as communicative\nsignals. This chapter first presents and discusses some other forms of expressive\nbehaviour that are used in human communication. Human Ethology is a subdiscipline\nof biology that deals among other things with the communicative functions of all\nkinds of expressive behaviour. Among the most communicative of such behavioural\nsignals are facial expressions. The chapter first reports on research about facial\nexpressions, highlighting the so-called \u2018eyebrow flash\u2019 and its communicative\nfunctions. It then describes how territorial behaviour of humans expressed in personal\ndistance, posture behaviour and body motion is another means of expressing\ncommunicative and interactional signals. It is shown that territorial behaviour is\ndifferent in different cultures.\nHuman ethologists argue that expressive movements like those presented and\ndiscussed in the first part of this chapter have undergone distinctive differentiation in\nthe service of signalling in phylogenetic and cultural ritualization processes. Thus, the\nsecond complex question asked in this chapter is: Why are forms of verbal and non-\nverbal expressive behaviour ritualized, what is the function of ritual behaviour and can\nrituals and forms of ritual behaviour be referred back to some basic underlying strategies\nof interactive forms of behaviour? After a brief discussion of the concepts ritual and\nritual communication, the chapter discusses Iren\u00e4us Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s claim that rituals\nand forms of ritual communication can be referred back to so-called basic interaction Introduction 7\nstrategies. The concept of basic interaction strategies and their communicative\nfunctions are presented and illustrated with analyses of the rituals of requesting, giving\nand taking of the Eipo in West Papua and with complex forms of ritual communication\nobserved during a festival of the Yanomam\u00f6 in the Amazon rainforest. Finally, Eibl-\nEibesfeldt\u2019s concept is discussed in connection with Stephen Levinson\u2019s recent\nproposals about a universal systematics of interaction and building blocks for cultural\ndiversity in social interaction, provided by what he calls the interaction engine.\nChapter Four P ragmatics and ethnology: The interface of language, culture\nand cognition\nThis chapter deals with the interrelationship of language, culture and cognition in\nhuman interaction. One of the anthropologists whose linguistic insights became\nextremely influential in pragmatics was Bronislaw Malinowski. The first part of this\nchapter introduces Malinowski\u2019s ethnographic theory about meaning and language.\nFor him, too, language was a mode of behaviour, a mode of action in which the\nmeaning of a word or an utterance is constituted by its function within certain\ncontexts. He was especially interested in answering the question: What are the essential\nforms of language? One of these forms is realized in what Malinowski calls phatic\ncommunion, a form of language use that has exclusively social bonding functions and\nthus does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas and expressing thoughts.\nThe first part of this chapter presents and critically assesses this concept and its\nfunctions and illustrates it with examples from Korean. However, the concept of phatic\ncommunion highlights only one aspect of Malinowski\u2019s linguistic thinking. He was\nalso very much interested both in universal features of language as well as in the\ninterrelationship between language, culture and cognition that is expressed in culture-\nspecific features and phenomena of languages.\nThis interest was shared by the linguist Franz Boas, one of Malinowski\u2019s\ncontemporaries. Boas\u2019s student Edward Sapir took up his teacher\u2019s cautiously\nformulated ideas about this interrelationship and together with his student Benjamin\nLee Whorf he formulated the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis about linguistic\nrelativity with which they claim to answer the question: What is the relationship\nbetween language and thought? Whorf came up with two versions of the linguistic\nrelativity principle; the strong version claims that language determines thought,\nwhereas the weak version claims that language influences thought. After the\npresentation of the linguistic relativity principle the second part of this chapter\ndiscusses, illustrates and critically assesses the hypothesis mainly on the basis of cross-\nlinguistic/cross-cultural research on the conceptualization of space and spatial\nreference. This research highlights the strong interrelationship between language,\nculture and cognition. Its results support the hypothesis that language contributes in\nshaping thinking for non-verbal problem solving instances.\nMalinowski, Boas and Sapir emphasized that language must be studied in its social\ncontext. Thus, it goes without saying that whoever wants to investigate the interrelationship\nbetween language, culture and cognition must know how the speech community being\nresearched constructs its social reality. Researchers need to be on common ground with 8 Introduction\nthe communities being researched. To achieve this aim, the ethnography of speaking\napproach provides a useful, though complex framework. The third part of this chapter\npresents a critical discussion and assessment of the ethnography of speaking paradigm\nwith illustrations from Joel Sherzer\u2019s research published as the Kuna Ways of Speaking.\nThese include ways of greeting and leave-taking, curing magic and the shouting of\nspecific texts during the girls\u2019 puberty rights.\nChapter Five Pragmatics and sociology: Everyday social interaction\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the research of three North American sociologists had a strong\nimpact on the understanding of human everyday face-to-face interaction in general\nand on the understanding of communicative behaviour and language use \u2013 especially\nin conversation \u2013 in particular.\nThe first part of this chapter features Erving Goffman, his insights in, and ideas\nabout, the presentation of self in everyday life, social encounters and forms of talk. He\nproposed to call this subarea of sociology which studies social interaction the\ninteraction order.\nThe second part of this chapter deals with Harold Garfinkel\u2019s so-called\nethnomethodological studies on social order, on everyday \u2018common sense\u2019 knowledge\nabout social structures and on reasoning in social action and communication; in short,\non how we make sense of our social world. His famous \u2018breaching experiments\u2019 are\nhighlighted and it is explained why we react aggressively when somebody responds to\na greeting like How are you? with the question How I am in regard to what? My health,\nmy finance, my work...\nInfluenced by Garfinkel, but also by Goffman, Harvey Sacks developed the field of\nConversation Analysis (CA) \u2013 in close cooperation with Emanuel A. Schegloff and Gail\nJefferson \u2013 to research how conversation is ordered and structurally organized. The\nfield of CA has been developed in sociology departments and still seems to be more\nstrongly rooted in this discipline than in departments of linguistics (although this has\nchanged somewhat in recent times). The third part of this chapter provides a basic\nintroduction to main topics of CA and illustrates the most recent developments of CA\nresearch.\nChapter Six Pragmatics and politics: Language, social class, ethnicity and\neducation and linguistic ideologies\nThis chapter tries to answer the question about the relationship between pragmatics\nand politics and the relevance and impact of politics for pragmatics. The 1960s were a\nhighly politicized decade which saw a strong rise of Marxist ideas and other left-wing\nideologies. Social inequalities and clashes between social classes came to the fore of the\ngeneral political discussion and they were taken up in the scientific discourse, especially\nwithin the humanities. In 1959 the British sociologist and former teacher Basil\nBernstein published a paper in which he differentiated between a \u2018public\u2019 and a \u2018formal\nlanguage\u2019; later he used the expressions \u2018restricted\u2019 and \u2018elaborated code\u2019 which children\nlearn in their sociocultural environment. He claimed that children who are only Introduction 9\nsocialized in a restricted code are limited in their communicative skills; usually these\nchildren are members of the lower classes; on the other hand, children who acquire\nand are socialized in an elaborate code are verbally skilled speakers who can deal with\nall kinds of communicative situations; usually these children grow up in middle class\nfamilies. Bernstein\u2019s research had not only political but also pedagogical consequences,\nboth in Europe and in North America. A number of so-called \u2018compensatory\u2019\neducation programmes were developed and carried out, like the Operation Headstart\nprogramme in the USA. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Bernstein\u2019s theory on the\ninterrelationship between language, social class and education and the compensatory\neducation programmes were heavily criticized. This theory, which was referred to as\nthe deficit hypothesis, was confronted with sociolinguistic approaches that were\nreferred to as the difference hypothesis. The most prominent representative of this latter\napproach was William Labov. Labov argued that compensatory programmes were\ndoomed to fail because they were \u2018designed to repair the child, rather than the school\u2019;\non the basis of his linguistic research he pleaded to change the institution \u2018School\u2019 so\nthat school education could offer equal opportunities to all pupils, regardless of their\nsocial class background. He emphasized that a proper understanding and assessing of\nthe verbal skills of lower class children, especially of Black lower class children in the\nurban centres of the USA, needed research into how they use their language in their\nsocial contexts. It is only there that one can gather adequate cultural knowledge based\non participant observation and proper linguistic data which enable linguists to detect\nthe rule-governed grammatical structure of these children\u2019s vernacular.\nThe first part of this chapter presents the research by Bernstein on the one hand and\nLabov on the other and the deficit versus difference hypothesis controversy that had\nstrong implications for linguistic pragmatics.\nThe discussion of Bernstein\u2019s and Labov\u2019s contributions to sociolinguistics illustrates\nhow linguistic research contributed to increase researchers\u2019 awareness of the political\nimpact of their studies. This observation is taken up in the second part of the chapter\nwhich discusses the topic of linguistic ideologies and its role for linguistic pragmatics.\nAfter a brief discussion of the concept this part of the chapter presents two exemplary\ncase studies of research on language ideologies in Pacific speech communities in\nHoniara on the Solomon Islands and on Rapa Nui and a comparative study on\nlanguage ideologies manifest in honorific language.\nChapter Seven Understanding pragmatics: Summary and outlook\nThe last chapter of this volume first provides a summary in which the three main\nthreads (mentioned above) that run through the six chapters of the volume are picked\nup again; they will be elaborated on the basis of the insights gained in Chapters One to\nSix. This summary points out once more that in this volume pragmatics is understood\nas the transdiscipline that studies context-dependent language and culture-specific\nforms of language use.\nThe last chapter ends with a brief outlook on future developments within linguistic\npragmatics. In recent years, Sachiko Ide, Yasuhiro Katagiri, William Hanks and other\nscholars have started a project on what they call \u2018emancipatory pragmatics\u2019 (see Hanks 10 Introduction\net al. 2009b; Hanks et al. 2012). They argue for a paradigm shift from \u2018traditional\npragmatics\u2019 towards \u2018emancipatory pragmatics\u2019 which no longer solely relies on\ntheories and views of language derived from Euro-American languages and ways of\nspeaking.\nNOTES\n1 I already reported this in Senft (1995: 217f.).\n2 This term was first used by Charles Morris (1938), who \u2013 following Charles Sanders Peirce\n\u2013 tried to develop a general science of signs \u2013 i.e. semiotics. For the role Peirce plays in and\nfor pragmatics see, e.g. Hookway (1998: 1084\u20131086). For a survey of the history of the term\n\u2018pragmatics\u2019 see Levinson (1983: 1ff.) and Gazdar (1979: 1ff.), also Seuren (1998: 406). 1\nPragmatics and philosophy\nWhat we do when we speak and what we actually mean \u2013\nspeech act theory and the theory of conversational implicature\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the central questions of philosophy is how we interpret our world and our lives\nas being \u2018meaningful\u2019, or, more generally, how we generate meaning in the general\nsense of \u2018significance\u2019. One of the most important tools we use to do this is language.\nAnd one of the most fascinating fields in linguistics is to study how speakers use their\nlanguage to generate specific meanings in specific contexts. This is the interface where\nphilosophy meets semantics and pragmatics.\nThere have been many different approaches by philosophers to answer questions\nlike: What is the meaning of a word? and What does a sentence mean? At the end of the\n1920s and the beginning of the 1930s, a group of philosophers and mathematicians in\nVienna and Berlin \u2013 among them scholars like Moritz Schlick (1882\u20131936), Rudolf\nCarnap (1891\u20131970), Curt G\u00f6del (1906\u20131978), Otto Neurath (1882\u20131945), Carl Hempel\n(1905\u20131997) and Hans Reichenbach (1891\u20131953) \u2013 claimed that a sentence is\nmeaningless unless its truth conditions can be tested, that is to say, unless formal\nlogical analyses of this sentence can answer the question under what conditions it is\ntrue or false. Sentences must be verifiable in order to be meaningful. This position\nimplied that all texts that were literary, theological or otherwise metaphysical and\nmost of the sentences produced by ordinary speakers in everyday verbal interaction\nwere meaningless! This highly formal and very constrained approach to language \u2013\nwhich was called \u2018logical positivism\u2019 \u2013 was taken up by a number of other European\nand American philosophers, like the British philosopher Alfred J. Ayer (1910\u20131989)\nwho propagated the paradigm of logical positivism and its so-called \u2018verificationist\ntheory of meaning\u2019 in his famous and at the time widely read book Language, Truth\nand Logic (Ayer 1936).\nProbably the most important reaction to this approach came from philosophers\nteaching at Oxford, especially between 1945 and 1970; they formed the so-called\nschool of Ordinary Language Philosophy (Seuren 1998: 367). Influenced by Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1889\u20131951) teachings at Cambridge during the 1930s and 1940s and\nhis later publications (see Seuren 1998: 419), the scholars who formed this school\ndistrusted the logical paradigm of the formal semantics of their time which was highly\ninfluenced by, if not completely based on, the logical positivism approach. They\nshowed that this paradigm could not properly deal with phenomena like anaphora 12 Understanding pragmatics\n(i.e. roughly speaking, reference to entities mentioned earlier in the discourse),\npresuppositions (i.e. roughly speaking, information that is taken for granted between\ninteracting speakers)1 and speech acts realized in ordinary natural language\n(see Seuren 1998: 367; 2009: Chapter 4). Among these scholars were Gilbert Ryle\n(1900\u20131976), Peter Geach (born 1916), Peter Strawson (1919\u20132006), John Austin\n(1911\u20131960), John Searle (born 1932) and H. Paul Grice (1913\u20131988).\nThis chapter deals first with the theory of speech acts put forward by John Austin\n(1962) and John R. Searle (1969). It then presents some of Pieter Seuren\u2019s (2009)\nthoughts on speech acts and their socially binding force and ends with a discussion of\nH. Paul Grice\u2019s theory of implicature and conversational maxims (Grice 1967; 1975;\n1978). Both speech act theory and Grice\u2019s theory of conversational implicature will be\ncritically assessed from an anthropological-linguistic perspective. This first chapter\ndeals with rather complex theoretical issues and requires careful reading.\n1.2 JOHN AUSTIN\u2019S SPEECH ACT THEORY\nThis section first discusses Austin\u2019s differentiation between assertions or statements\n\u2013 to which Austin refers with the term \u2018constatives\u2019 and utterances with which\nsomething is done; Austin refers to these utterances with the term \u2018performatives\u2019.\nThen the section reveals the two turns in Austin\u2019s argument: first he gives up the\ndifferentiation between performatives and constatives and then he presents his\nclassification acts which are central for his idea of language as action. He differentiates\nbetween locutions \u2013 that is speech acts which have meaning, illocutions \u2013 that is speech\nacts which have a certain force and perlocutions \u2013 that is speech acts which achieve\ncertain effects. Austin himself is aware of the fact that in his theory he has \u2018left\nnumerous loose ends\u2019 (Austin 1962: 148).\n1.2.1 Statements versus utterances that do something: Constatives versus\nperformatives\nJohn Austin\u2019s philosophy of language deals with some uses of ordinary language. He\nwas convinced that \u2018a distinction has to be drawn between the meaning expressed by\nan utterance and the way in which the utterance is used (i.e. its \u2018force\u2019) and \u2026 that\nutterances of every kind \u2026 can be considered as acts\u2019 (Sbis\u00e0 1995: 496). He developed\nhis speech act theory in his 12 William James Lectures which he delivered at Harvard\nUniversity in 1955 and which were posthumously published in his booklet How to Do\nThings with Words (Austin 1962). Austin\u2019s booklet was not intended to present a ready-\nmade theory, so to speak, but as an expos\u00e9 of his thoughts about language use as they\ndeveloped.\nIn his first four lectures he makes a distinction between sentences like (1) and (2) on\nthe one hand and (3) and (4) on the other:\n(1) I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth (Austin 1962: 5). Pragmatics and philosophy 13\n(2) I bet you six pence Fury, the black stallion, will win the race.\nand\n(3) My daughter\u2019s name is Frauke and my son is called Sebastian.\n(4) We live in a small provincial town in the northwest of Germany.\nHe refers to the first two declarative sentences, in which something is done in or by\nsaying something, as \u2018performative\u2019 sentences; they are characterized by having verbs\nproduced \u2018in the first person singular present indicative active\u2019 (Austin 1962: 5) which\nmake the action performed by the speaker explicit. Thus, these sentences perform an\nact (like baptizing or betting); they are neither \u2018true\u2019 nor \u2018false\u2019; \u2018they are seen \u2026 to be\n\u2026 not utterances which could be \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d\u2019. Verbs that can be used performatively\nare called \u2018performative verbs\u2019. Sentences like (3) and (4), assertions or statements, are\n\u2018constative\u2019 sentences in Austin\u2019s terminology; in these sentences something is said\nwhich can be true or false (Austin 1962: 3, 12).\nHowever, although Austin states that performatives cannot be true or false because,\ngiven their specific nature, this question is irrelevant, he points out that nevertheless\nperformatives can go wrong \u2013 like announcing the bet in sentence (2) after the race is\nover. In this situation, the performative utterance is \u2018in general unhappy\u2019 (Austin 1962:\n14). Thus performatives have to meet at least the following so-called \u2018felicity conditions\u2019:\nA. (i) There must be a conventional procedure having a conventional effect.\n(ii) The circumstances and persons must be appropriate, as specified in the\nprocedure.\nB. The procedure must be executed (i) correctly and (ii) completely.\nC. Often (i) the persons must have the requisite thoughts, feelings and intentions, as\nspecified in the procedure, and (ii) if consequent conduct is specified, then the\nrelevant parties must so do.\n(Levinson 1983: 229; see Austin 1962: 15)\nAustin provides examples for situations in which these conditions are not fulfilled:\nA. (i) Assume there is a married couple and both are Christians. If the husband says\nto his wife \u2018I hereby divorce you\u2019 repeating this utterance three times he will\nnot achieve a divorce; however, with a Muslim couple such an action would\nconstitute a divorce.\nA. (ii) Assume a clergyman baptizing a baby \u2018Albert\u2019 instead of \u2018Alfred\u2019 (see Austin\n1962: 27, 35).\nB. (i) A ssume a man says \u2018my house\u2019 when he actually has two (and the context does\nnot make clear which of the two is meant) or \u2018I bet the race won\u2019t be run today\u2019 14 Understanding pragmatics\nwhen more than one race was arranged (and the context fails to make clear\nwhich race is intended).\nB. (ii) A bridegroom\u2019s attempt to marry by saying \u2018I do\u2019 is abortive if the bride says \u2018I\ndo not\u2019 (see Austin 1962: 36f.).\nAustin calls A and B infelicities \u2018which are such that the act for the performing of\nwhich, and in the performing of which, the verbal formula in question is designed, is\nnot achieved, by the name MISFIRES\u2026\u2019 (Austin 1962: 16). Here the actions intended\nare simply not achieved.\nC. (i) Assume somebody is asked for advice and he intentionally gives bad advice.\nC. (ii) A ssume somebody promises something without any intention whatsoever to\nkeep the promise (see Austin 1962: 42, 45).\nC conditions are insincerities and infractions or breaches; Austin\u2019s name for those\ninfelicities where the act is achieved but insincerely is \u2018ABUSES\u2019 (see Austin 1962: 16, 39).2\nAustin then points out that constatives are also affected by these felicity conditions.\nFor instance, \u2018statements which refer to something which does not exist\u2019 and he gives\nthe examples (5) to (8) (Austin 1962: 20, 48, 143):\n(5) The present King of France is bald.3\nThe utterance given in example (6) violates a felicity condition, namely condition C (i):\n(6) The cat is on the mat but I do not believe it is.\nA sentence like (7) is neither true nor false, it is simply \u2018a rough description\u2019:\n(7) France is hexagonal.\nAnd if someone utters a constative like (8),\n(8) All Jack\u2019s children are bald.\nhe or she presupposes that Jack has children; one cannot say All Jack\u2019s children are bald\nbut Jack has no children or Jack has no children and all his children are bald because the\npresupposition of an utterance like (8), the information that is taken for granted, would\nbe violated. Thus, performatives and constatives are actually affected by phenomena\nthat have something to do with sincerity, commitment and presupposition; thus, they\nhave a \u2018common underlying structure\u2019 (Sbis\u00e0 1995: 497). This means that performatives\nand constatives are not really as distinct from each other as Austin claimed them to be.\n1.2.2 Two turns in Austin\u2019s argument\nTo sum up so far, Austin first differentiates between constatives, i.e. utterances that\nsimply say something \u2013 and performatives, i.e. utterances that do things, achieving the Pragmatics and philosophy 15\nactions they express because there are conventions that link the utterances to\ninstitutionalized procedures. He then shows, however, that this distinction is somewhat\nartificial. And at the end of the fourth lecture Austin foreshadows a twist in his\nargument and gradually develops his general conception of speech as action in the\nnext eight lectures. Austin closes his fourth lecture as follows:\nwe see that in order to explain what can go wrong with statements we cannot just\nconcentrate on the proposition involved (whatever that is) as has been done traditionally.\nWe must consider the total situation in which the utterance is issued \u2013 the total speech-\nact \u2013 if we were to see the parallel between statements and performative utterances,\nand how each can go wrong. So the total speech act in the total speech situation is\nemerging from logic piecemeal as important in special cases: and thus we are\nassimilating the supposed constative utterance to the performative.4\n(Austin 1962: 52)\nIndeed, in the following lectures Austin justifies this assimilation of the constative to\nthe performative, pointing out that there are no absolute grammatical or lexical criteria\nto justify the distinction he started with. Utterances like (9):\n(9) It is yours.\n\u2018may be taken as equivalent to either \u201cI give it to you\u201d or \u201cit (already) belongs to you\u201d\u2019.\nThus utterances can be used on different occasions as a performative and as a\nconstative. Nevertheless, Austin points out that performatives with verbs in the first\nperson present indicative active deserve special attention. The use of first person\npresent indicative active is \u2018asymmetrical with respect to other persons and tenses of\nthe indicative mood of the same verb, since these would constitute mere descriptions\nand reports\u2019 (Sbis\u00e0 1995: 497). Based on this observation Austin now suggests making\na list of explicit performative verbs and claims that all performative utterances which\nare not in the form \u2018I x that\u2019, \u2018I x to\u2019, or \u2018I x\u2019 can \u2018be \u201creduced\u201d to this form\u2019 and will then\nconstitute what he calls \u2018explicit performatives\u2019. These explicit performatives, i.e.\nperformative utterances containing a performative verb, are opposed \u2018to \u201cprimary\u201d\nperformative[s]\u2019 (Austin 1962: 69). Primary performatives are performative utterances\nwhich are produced without a performative verb. Example (10) is a primary utterance,\nwhereas example (11) is an explicit performative (see Austin 1962: 69):\n(10) I shall be there.\n(11) I (hereby) promise that I shall be there.\nExplicit performatives can be reinforced by adding the adverb \u2018hereby\u2019, although \u2018it is\nrather too formal for ordinary purposes\u2019 (Austin 1962: 61). Austin claims that the \u2018explicit\nperformative develops from the primary\u2019; this means that \u2018every performative could be\nin principle put into the form of an explicit performative\u2019 (Austin 1962: 83, 91).\nHowever, Austin has to point out once more that it is not easy to decide whether an\nutterance is performative or not. He refers, for example to expressions like \u2018I approve\u2019 16 Understanding pragmatics\nand \u2018I agree\u2019 stating that \u2018\u201cI approve\u201d may have the performative force of giving\napproval or it may have the descriptive meaning: \u201cI favour this\u201d\u2019 (Austin 1962: 78).\nMoreover, performative verbs can also be used descriptively as in sentence (12):\n(12) I named this ship the Queen Elizabeth.\nIn addition, an utterance like \u2018I state that...\u2019 seems to satisfy the requirements of being\na performative one, but it clearly is a statement which can be true or false, depending\non the included proposition like, for example, \u2018I state that the Earth is flat\u2019. Here Austin\ndecides that he has to start thinking about the problem from a different perspective\n(see Austin: 1962: 91).\nHe now abandons the dichotomy between performatives and constatives. This\nmarks the first turn in Austin\u2019s argument: He no longer sees performatives as a \u2018special\nclass of sentences with peculiar syntactic and pragmatic properties\u2019 but points out\ninstead that \u2018there is a general class of performative utterances that includes ... explicit\nperformatives ... and [primary performatives], the latter including lots of other kinds\nof utterances, if not all\u2019 (Levinson 1983: 231). Moreover, at the end of the seventh\nlecture at the latest we notice the \u2018shift from the dichotomy performative/constative to\na general theory of illocutionary acts of which the various performatives and constatives\nare just special sub-cases\u2019 (Levinson 1983: 231).5\nIn her seminal article on \u2018How to read Austin\u2019, Marina Sbis\u00e0 points out that in How\nto Do Things with Words (HTW):\nfrom the very start the performative/constative distinction plays an instrumental role.\nThe analysis of performative utterances provides a first approach to actions performed\nin speech, and therefore to the kinds of things that are done by illocutionary acts.\nConstatives are just a straw man, to be replaced with an analysis of assertion as an\nillocutionary act ... Confirmation of this reading is scattered throughout initial\nlectures, in hints that make sense only in the light of the main thesis which will be\nrevealed later in the book, i.e. that all speech should be considered as action.\nSo, HTW appears as a complex argument in support of the claim that all speech\nshould be considered as action, and, more specifically, that speech can be described as\nthe performing of actions of the same kind as those performed by means of performative\nutterances. This complex argument has the form of a proof by contradiction. The\nthesis proposed at the beginning is the opposite of the intended one and its refutation\nserves as a proof of the intended thesis.\n(Sbis\u00e0 2007: 462f.)\n1.2.3 Utterances which say something, do something and produce effects:\nLocutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary acts\nAustin now reconsiders \u2018more generally the senses in which to say something may be\nto do something, or in saying something we do something...\u2019 (Austin 1962: 91) and\nproposes a framework in terms of which all speech acts, i.e. constatives as well as Pragmatics and philosophy 17\nperformatives, can be described. He distinguishes three components in every\nutterance.\nFirst, he calls the \u2018act of \u201csaying something\u201d ... a locutionary act, and the study of\nutterances ... the study of locutions, or of full units of speech\u2019 (see Austin 1962: 92ff.).\nFor Austin saying something is:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) to perform a \u2018phonetic\u2019 act (the act of uttering certain noises);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) to perform a \u2018phatic\u2019 act (the act of uttering certain words in a certain grammatical\nconstruction);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) to perform a \u2018rhetic\u2019 act (the act of using words with a certain meaning).\nSbis\u00e0 (1995: 498) points out that when we report a speaker\u2019s locutionary act we either\nfocus on the phatic act (e.g. in the utterance: \u2018He said \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d\u2019) using\ndirect speech or we focus on the rhetic act (e.g. in the utterance: \u2018He said that the cat\nwas on the mat\u2019) using indirect speech which reports the meaning of the utterance but\ndoes not quote the words in the form they were uttered.\nAustin (1962: 98ff.) then claims that locutionary acts are also and at the same time\nillocutionary acts, i.e. acts of doing something in saying something like accusing,\nasking and answering questions, apologizing, blaming, informing, ordering, assuring,\nwarning, announcing an intention, making an appointment, giving a description,\npromising and stating. Illocutionary acts conform to conventions and have a certain\nconventional force, the \u2018illocutionary force\u2019 which will cause certain effects.\nAnd Austin finally contrasts locutionary and illocutionary acts with \u2018perlocutionary\u2019\nacts, i.e. acts of doing something by saying something like persuading, alerting,\nconvincing, deterring, surprising and getting somebody to do something.\nPerlocutionary acts produce effects upon the feelings, thoughts or actions of the\naddressee(s) and thus have psychological and/or behavioural consequences (see Austin\n1962: 101f.; also Sbis\u00e0 2010: section 3.4).\nAfter this first introduction of locutions, illocutions and perlocutions Austin\nprovides examples like the following (slightly modified) one:\nLocution:\nHe said to me \u2018kiss her!\u2019 meaning by \u2018kiss\u2019 kiss and referring by \u2018her\u2019 to her.\nIllocution:\nHe urged (or advised, ordered, etc.) me to kiss her.\nPerlocution:\nHe got me to (or made me, etc.) kiss her.\nThus, a locutionary act (which includes the phonetic, phatic and rhetic acts) just means\nsaying something meaningful in its normal sense. The performance of this locutionary\nact involves an illocutionary act which has a certain force (like, for example, urging,\nadvising, ordering, forcing, etc.). And the achieved effect of this illocutionary act on 18 Understanding pragmatics\nthe listener (which has consequences for her or him) is the perlocutionary act (see\nAustin 1962: 121; also Clark 1996a: 146).\nHaving introduced these acts, Austin concentrates on illocutionary acts and\ncontrasts them with perlocutionary acts.\nAs already mentioned above, illocutionary acts conform to conventions and have a\ncertain conventional force, the illocutionary force which will cause certain effects.\nThus, contrary to a perlocutionary act an illocutionary act produces effects; only if\nsuch an effect is achieved, is the illocutionary act performed successfully or happily. He\nillustrates this with the following example:\nI cannot be said to have warned an audience unless it hears what I say and takes what\nI say in a certain sense. An effect must be achieved on the audience if the illocutionary\nact is to be carried out ... So the performance of an illocutionary act involves the\nsecuring of uptake.\n(Austin 1962: 116f.)\n\u2018Uptake\u2019 is a necessary condition for the successful performance, i.e. the achievement\nof the core effect of an illocutionary act; and this uptake goes beyond the mere\nunderstanding of the illocution. The \u2018securing of uptake\u2019 is the first class of effect of the\nillocutionary act. It brings about \u2018the understanding of the meaning and of the force of\nthe locution\u2019 (Sbis\u00e0 1995: 498; see also 2007: 464).\nThe second class of effect of the illocutionary act is the production of a conventional\neffect. Austin (1962: 117f.) describes this as follows: \u2018The illocutionary act \u201ctakes effect\u201d\nin certain ways, as distinguished from producing consequences in the sense of bringing\nabout states of affairs in the \u201cnormal\u201d way, i.e. changes in the natural course of events\u2019.\nHe illustrates this statement with the example of naming a ship (see example (1)\nabove).6\nAnd the third class of effect of the illocutionary act is that it invites a response or a\nsequel; a promise, for example, has to be fulfilled.\nAustin summarizes these effects of illocutionary acts and then opposes them to\neffects which are characteristic of perlocutionary acts:\nSo here are three ways, securing uptake, taking effect, and inviting a response, in\nwhich illocutionary acts are bound up with effects; and these are all distinct from the\nproducing of effects which is characteristic of the perlocutionary act.\n(Austin 1962: 118)\nWith the perlocutionary act a speaker achieves effects upon the feelings, thoughts or\nactions of the participant(s) in certain situations and specific circumstances; these\neffects have psychological and/or behavioural consequences for the participant(s) \u2013 be\nit the audience, the speaker him- or herself, or other persons. Perlocutionary acts are\ncausal. Austin (1962: 119ff.) points out that the response or sequel of perlocutionary\nacts can also be achieved by non-verbal means: \u2018thus intimidation may be achieved by\nwaving a stick or pointing a gun\u2019. Contrary to illocutionary acts, perlocutionary acts\nare not conventional. The effects of the speaker\u2019s perlocutionary acts may be intended Pragmatics and philosophy 19\nby the speaker, but they may also be unintended (see Austin 1962: 106f.). However,\nSbis\u00e0 points out that:\n[t]here is agency whenever it is fair to ascribe to an agent responsibility for a certain\noutcome ... If agents \u201cdo\u201d whatever they may be justly ascribed (at least partial)\nresponsibility for, a perlocutionary act is performed whenever the speaker is (at least\npartially) responsible for some act or state of the listener. And if this holds for the\nperlocutionary act, the whole locutionary-illocutionary-perlocutionary distinction\nshould ... be read as a distinction ... among the kinds of effects for which speakers may\nbe ascribed responsibility.\n(Sbis\u00e0 2007: 467)\nThis is a very interesting way of \u2018how to read Austin\u2019. However, Austin himself concedes\n(especially in his tenth lecture) that despite all his efforts to characterize the difference\nbetween illocutionary and perlocutionary acts it turns out to be quite difficult to\ndistinguish them clearly.7\nIn his last lecture Austin attempts to come up with a first and quite rudimentary\ntaxonomy of illocutionary verbs, based on their illocutionary force. As mentioned\nabove, Austin is aware of the fact that in his lectures he has \u2018left numerous loose ends\u2019\nand that he produced \u2018a programme, that is, saying what ought to be done rather than\ndoing something\u2019 (Austin 1962: 148, 164). Nevertheless, his idea of language as action\nwhich he proposed in How to Do Things with Words gave rise to \u2018speech act theory\u2019.\n1.3 JOHN SEARLE\u2019S SPEECH ACT THEORY\nThis section first illustrates what Searle takes a speech act to be. Then it presents his\nanalysis of the illocutionary act of sincere promising and its propositional content\nconditions. Then it is shown how on the basis of such content conditions he formulates\nthe constitutive rules for illocutionary acts. After the presentation of Searle\u2019s\nclassification of illocutionary acts this section ends with a brief discussion of speech\nact theory from a cross-cultural perspective.\n1.3.1 What is a speech act?\nIt was Austin\u2019s student John R. Searle who systematized and somewhat formalized\nAustin\u2019s ideas in his theory of speech acts (see Searle 1965; 1975; 1976; 2006; but especially\n1969). Searle points out that \u2018the basic unit of human linguistic communication is the\nillocutionary act\u2019 in the form of a \u2018complete sentence\u2019 produced under specific conditions\n(Searle 1976: 1; see also 1965 (1972)8: 137; 1969: 25). Illocutionary acts have an \u2018effect\u2019 on\nthe hearer; the hearer understands the speaker\u2019s utterance.\nFor Searle speaking is performing illocutionary acts in a rule-governed form of behaviour.\nThese rules are either regulative and can be paraphrased as imperatives, or they are\nconstitutive and create and define new forms of behaviour. Searle\u2019s constitutive rules of\nspeech acts represent Austin\u2019s felicity conditions (see Searle 1972: 137ff.; see 1.3.3 below). 20 Understanding pragmatics\nSearle\u2019s 1965 paper \u2018What is a speech act\u2019 is based on the hypothesis \u2018that the\nsemantics of a language can be regarded as a series of systems of constitutive rules and\nthat illocutionary acts are acts performed in accordance with these sets of constitutive\nrules\u2019 (Searle 1972: 140). Before Searle illustrates this idea by formulating such a set of\nconstitutive rules for the speech act of \u2018promising\u2019, some further clarifications are\nnecessary. After presenting the following sentences (see Searle 1972: 140f.):\n(13) Will John leave the room?\n(14) John will leave the room.\n(15) John, leave the room!\n(16) Would that John left the room.\n(17) If John will leave the room, I will leave also.\nhe first points out that in all these utterances \u2013 performances of different illocutionary\nacts on given occasions \u2013 the speaker refers to a particular person, i.e. John and predicates\nthe act of that person leaving the room. Although the illocutionary acts are different,\nbeing realized as a question, an assertion about the future, i.e. a prediction, an order, an\nexpression of a wish and a hypothetical expression of intention, the acts of reference and\npredication are the same because they have a common content. Searle calls this common\ncontent a \u2018proposition\u2019. Thus, when speakers perform an illocutionary act they perform\nat one and the same time an \u2018utterance act\u2019 (by uttering words) as well as a \u2018propositional\nact\u2019 (by expressing a proposition in referring to or predicating something). Thus,\nillocutionary acts not only have a specific illocutionary force, but also a propositional\ncontent (see Searle 1969: 31). According to this insight, a sentence has two parts: \u2018a\nproposition-indicating element and the function-indicating device\u2019 which reveals \u2018what\nillocutionary force the utterance is to have\u2019 and thus \u2018what illocutionary act the speaker\nis performing in the utterance of the sentence\u2019. These devices include \u2013 at least for English\n\u2013 \u2018word order, stress, intonation contour, punctuation, the mood of the verb, and finally\na set of so-called performative verbs\u2019 (Searle 1972: 142).\nThen Searle discusses the questions \u2018...what is it for one to mean something by what\none says, and what is it for something to have a meaning?\u2019 (Searle 1972: 143). He points\nout that \u2018[m]eaning is more than a matter of intention, it is also a matter of convention\u2019\nand emphasizes that:\none\u2019s meaning something when one says something is more than just contingently\nrelated to what the sentence means in the language one is speaking. In our analysis of\nillocutionary acts, we must capture both the intentional and conventional aspects of\nand especially the relationship between them. In the performance of an illocutionary\nact the speaker intends to produce a certain effect by means of getting the hearer to\nrecognize his intention to produce this effect, and furthermore, if he is using words\nliterally, he intends this recognition to be achieved in virtue of the fact that the rules for\nusing the expressions he utters associate the expressions with the production of that Pragmatics and philosophy 21\neffect. It is this combination of elements which we shall need to express in our analysis\nof the illocutionary act.\n(Searle 1972: 145f.)\n1.3.2 Sincere promising and its propositional content conditions\nAfter these clarifications Searle analyses the illocutionary act of sincere promising.9 I\nassume that most people would come up with a rather straightforward answer when\nthey were asked to explain, for example, what it means when they promise their friends\nwith whom they want to go to the cinema to order the tickets. Searle illustrates how\ncomplex this speech act is. He starts with describing the situation in which a speaker\ndirects a sentence to a hearer in which he sincerely promises to do something under\nthe following conditions10:\n1. The utterance is produced in such a way that the hearer understands what the\nspeaker says.\n2. The speaker makes the promise by uttering the sentence which is directed\ntowards the hearer. Searle (1972: 148) elaborates on this condition as follows:\n\u2018This condition isolates the propositional content from the rest of the speech\nact and enables us to concentrate on the peculiarities of promising in the rest\nof the analysis\u2019.\n3. The speaker makes a promise. This promise may refer to something he or she\nmay or may not do in the future once or repeatedly, or it may refer to remaining\n\u2018in a certain state or condition\u2019. Searle calls conditions (2) and (3) \u2018the\npropositional content conditions\u2019.\n4. The hearer prefers that the speaker does something, and the speaker believes\nthat this is true. Searle elaborates on this condition by pointing out that the\nutterance must be intended as a promise and not as another speech act, like a\nthreat or a warning. He points out that \u2018\u201cI promise\u201d and \u201cI hereby promise\u201d are\namong the strongest function indicating devices for commitment provided by\nthe English language\u2019.\n5. The speech act to be performed \u2018must have a point\u2019. Searle elaborates on this\ncondition by pointing out that there is no point in promising something that\none will do anyhow. He refers to conditions (4) and (5) as \u2018preparatory\nconditions\u2019.\n6. The speaker will keep his or her promise. This is what Searle calls the \u2018sincerity\ncondition\u2019 of the illocutionary act of sincere promising.\n7. The speaker who makes the promise feels obliged to keep it. For Searle this is\nthe \u2018essential condition\u2019 of the illocutionary act of sincere promising. 22 Understanding pragmatics\n8. The speaker wants to convince the hearer that the promise made is meant\nseriously.\n9. The promise is produced in a grammatically and semantically adequate way in\na situation in which the other eight conditions prevail.\n1.3.3 Illocutionary acts and their constitutive rules\nSearle points out that conditions (1), (8) and (9) \u2018apply generally to all kinds of normal\nillocutionary acts\u2019 (Searle 1969: 62). On the basis of the above listed conditions (2) to\n(7), which are required to make a sincere promise, Searle now extracts the set of rules\n\u2018for the use of any function indicating device P for promising\u2019:\nRule 1. [The promise] is to be uttered only in the context of a sentence (or larger stretch\nof discourse) the utterance of which predicates some future act ... of the Speaker ... I call\nthis the propositional content rule. It is derived from the propositional content\nconditions (2) and (3).\nRule 2. [The promise] is to be uttered only if the hearer ... would prefer [the speaker\u2019s]\ndoing [the act] to his not doing [the act], and [the speaker] believes [the hearer] would\nprefer [the speaker\u2019s] doing [the act] to his not doing [the act].\nRule 3. [The promise] is to be uttered only if it is not obvious to both [the speaker]\nand [the hearer] that [the speaker] will do [the act] in the normal course of events. I call\nrules (2) and (3) preparatory rules. They are derived from the preparatory conditions\n(4) and (5).\nRule 4. [The promise] is to be uttered only if [the speaker] intends to do [the act]. I\ncall this the sincerity rule. It is derived from the sincerity condition (6).\nRule 5. The utterance of [the promise] counts as the undertaking of an obligation to\ndo [the act]. I call this the essential rule.\nThese rules are ordered: Rules 2\u20135 apply only if rule 1 is satisifed, and Rule 5 applies\nonly if Rules 2 and 3 are satisfied as well.\n(Searle 1969: 63)\nSearle\u2019s rules are summarized by Sbis\u00e0 as follows:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Propositional content rules \u201cspecify what kind of propositional content the speech\nact is to have\u201d, i.e. what the speech act is about.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Preparatory condition rules \u201cspecify contextual requirements (especially regarding\nthe speaker\u2019s and the hearer\u2019s epistemic and volitional states)\u201d, i.e. the necessary\nprerequisites for the speech act.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Sincerity condition rules specify \u201cwhich psychological state of the speaker will be\nexpressed by the speech act\u201d, i.e. whether the speech act is performed sincerely or not.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Essential condition rules \u201csay what kind of illocutionary act the utterance is to\ncount as\u201d.\n(Sbis\u00e0 1995: 500) Pragmatics and philosophy 23\nSearle finishes his paper \u2018What is a speech act\u2019 by pointing out that this analysis of\nthe speech act \u2018promising\u2019 can also be used for the analysis of other speech acts. He\nprovides proposals for the analysis of the speech acts \u2018giving an order\u2019, \u2018assertion\u2019 and\n\u2018greeting\u2019 (see Searle 1972: 154). In his 1969 book Speech Acts he takes up this idea and\nprovides similar analyses for the following types of illocutionary act: request, assert/\nstate (that)/affirm, question, thank (for), advise, warn, greet and congratulate (Searle\n1969: 66f.). Table 1.1 illustrates these proposals for the analysis of the speech acts\n\u2018request\u2019, \u2018assert\u2019 and \u2018greet\u2019 (see Searle 1969: 66f.; 1972: 154) based on their felicity\nconditions \u2013 that is, their constitutive rules.\nTable 1.1\nComparison of the analysis of the illocutionary act types \u2018Request\u2019, \u2018Assert, state (that), affirm\u2019 and \u2018Greet\u2019\n(based on their felicity conditions, i.e. their constitutive rules)\nRequest Assert, state (that) Greet\naffirm\npropositional content Future act A of H Any proposition p None\nrule\npreparatory condition 1.

Among the most important of these\ndimensions of differences between speech acts are:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) the illocutionary point,\n(cid:120)(cid:3) the direction of fit, and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) the expressed psychological states.\nBefore the description of these, for Searle, most important dimensions of variation in\nwhich speech acts differ from each other, the other nine dimensions he lists in his 24 Understanding pragmatics\npaper \u2018A classification of illocutionary acts\u2019 will be mentioned. With these dimensions\nSearle (1976: 5ff.) points at differences:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018in the force or strength with which the illocutionary point is presented\u2019 (Searle\nprovides the examples \u2018I suggest we go to the movies\u2019 and \u2018I insist that we go to the\nmovies\u2019 which both have the same illocutionary point but are presented with\ndifferent strengths);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018in the status of position of the speaker and hearer as these bear on the illocutionary\nforce of an utterance\u2019 (Searle refers to a general asking a private to clean up his room\n\u2013 which is a command, and a private asking a general to do the same \u2013 which is\nmost probably a suggestion or a proposal, if not an act of insubordination);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018in the way the utterance relates to the interest of the speaker and the hearer\u2019 (compare\nthe differences between boasts and laments, congratulations and condolences);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018in relations to the rest of the discourse\u2019 (performative expressions like \u2018I conclude\u2019\nor adverbs and conjunctions like \u2018moreover\u2019, \u2018therefore\u2019 and \u2018however\u2019 relate an\nutterance to the rest of the discourse);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018in propositional content ... determined by illocutionary-force-indicating devices\u2019 (a\nreport can be about the past or present, a prediction must be about the future);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018between those acts that must always be speech acts and those that can be, but need\nnot be performed as speech acts\u2019;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018between those acts that require extra-linguistic institutions for their performance\nand those that do not\u2019 (in order to bless, christen, pronounce guilty, etc. the speaker\nmust have a position within an extra-linguistic institution; making a statement\nlike \u2018it is raining\u2019 does not require extra-linguistic institutions);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018between those acts where the corresponding illocutionary verb has a performative\nuse and those where it does not\u2019 (most illocutionary verbs like \u2018state\u2019, \u2018promise\u2019,\n\u2018order\u2019 have performative uses, but one cannot perform acts of boasting, for\nexample, by saying \u2018I hereby boast\u2019); and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) \u2018in the style of performance of the illocutionary act\u2019 (e.g. the difference between\nannouncing and confiding need not involve a difference in illocutionary point or\npropositional content, but only in the style of how the illocutionary act is\nperformed).\nBut back to Searle\u2019s most important dimensions of variation in which speech acts differ\nfrom each other.\nFirst, \u2018[d]ifferences in the point (or purpose) of the (type of) act ... affect the attempts to\nget the hearer to do something\u2019. Searle points out that the\npoint or purpose of a description is that it is a representation (true or false, accurate or\ninaccurate) of how something is. The point or purpose of a promise is that it is an\nundertaking of an obligation by the speaker to do something ... Pragmatics and philosophy 25\nThe point or purpose of a type of illocution I shall call its illocutionary point.\nIllocutionary point is part of but not the same as illocutionary force. Thus, e.g., the\nillocutionary point of request is the same as that of commands: both are attempts to get\nthe hearer to do something. But the illocutionary forces are clearly different.\n(Searle 1976: 2f.)\nThe second most important dimensions of variation in which speech acts differ from\neach other are \u2018[d]ifferences in the direction of fit between words and the world\u2019. Searle\n(1976: 3) points out that some \u2018illocutions have as part of their illocutionary point to\nget the words ... to match the world, others to get the world to match the words.\nAssertions are in the former category, promises and requests are in the latter\u2019. He\nillustrates these differences with an example taken from G. E. M. Anscombe (1957).\nImagine a man gets a shopping list from his wife with the words \u2018beans, butter, bacon,\nand bread\u2019 on it and goes to a supermarket. He is followed by a detective who notes\ndown what he takes. When both leave the shop they have two identical lists; however,\nthese lists have different functions. The man who did the shopping is supposed to\nmake his actions fit the list, i.e. to get the world to match the words. The purpose of the\ndetective\u2019s list is to make the words match the world, the list has to note the actions of\nthe shopper. If the detective goes home and realizes that the man bought pork chops\ninstead of bacon he can erase the word \u2018bacon\u2019 on his list and write \u2018pork chops\u2019. The\nshopper who comes home and is told by his wife that he bought pork chops instead of\nbacon cannot correct his mistake by erasing \u2018bacon\u2019 from the list and writing \u2018pork\nchops\u2019 (see Searle 1976: 3).\nThe third most important dimension of variation in which speech acts differ from\neach other affects \u2018[d]ifferences in expressed psychological states\u2019. Searle illustrates this\ndimension as follows:\nA man who states, explains, asserts or claims that p expresses the belief that p; a man\nwho promises, vows, threatens or pledges to do expresses an intention to do A ... In\ngeneral, in the performance of any illocutionary act with a propositional content, the\nspeaker expresses some attitude, state, etc., to that propositional content.... The\npsychological state expressed in the performance of the illocutionary act is the sincerity\ncondition of the act... If one tries to do a classification of illocutionary acts based\nentirely on differently expressed psychological states ... one can get quite a long way...\n(Searle 1976: 4)\nSearle, however, does not attempt to base his classification of illocutionary acts only on\nthe way psychological states are expressed in performing illocutionary acts. His\ntypology of speech acts is based on the three dimensions \u2018illocutionary point\u2019,\n\u2018direction of fit\u2019, and \u2018expressed psychological state\u2019. After a critical survey of Austin\u2019s\ntaxonomy for illocutionary verbs presented in his last William James Lecture, Searle\npresents his own taxonomy, a list of what he regards \u2018as the basic categories of\nillocutionary acts\u2019 (Searle 1976: 10). This list consists of the following five types: 26 Understanding pragmatics\n1. Representatives. Like Austin\u2019s constatives, representatives have a truth value:\nThey \u2018commit the speaker to something\u2019s being the case, to the truth of the\nexpressed proposition ... The direction of fit is words to the world; the\npsychological state expressed is Belief (that p)\u2019 (Searle 1976: 10f.)11. Thus, acts of\n\u2018asserting\u2019, \u2018reporting\u2019, \u2018stating\u2019, \u2018concluding\u2019, \u2018deducing\u2019, and \u2018describing\u2019 are\nparadigmatic cases of representatives. Sentence (18) illustrates this type:\n(18) Barack H. Obama is the forty-fourth President of the United States.\n2. Directives. The illocutionary point of directives is that they \u2018are attempts ... by the\nspeaker to get the hearer to do something ... The direction of fit is world-to-words and\nthe sincerity condition is want (or wish or desire). The propositional content is always\nthat the hearer ... does some future action\u2019 (Searle 1976: 11). Acts of \u2018requesting\u2019,\n\u2018asking\u2019, \u2018ordering\u2019, \u2018commanding\u2019, \u2018begging\u2019, \u2018pleading\u2019, \u2018praying\u2019, \u2018defying\u2019 and\n\u2018challenging\u2019 are paradigmatic cases of directives. Sentence (19) illustrates this type:\n(19) Go home.\n3. Commissives. They are \u2018illocutionary acts whose point is to commit the speaker\n... to some future course of action ... The direction of fit is world-to-words and\nthe sincerity condition is Intention. The propositional content is always that\nthe speaker ... does some future action ...\u2019 (Searle 1976: 11). Acts of \u2018promising\u2019,\n\u2018threatening\u2019, \u2018offering\u2019 and \u2018pledging\u2019 are paradigmatic cases of commissives.\nSentence (20) illustrates this type:\n(20) I will have written this paper by Friday next week.\n4. Expressives. \u2018The illocutionary point of this class is to express the psychological\nstate specified in the sincerity condition about a state of affairs specified in the\npropositional contents ... in expressives there is no direction of fit\u2019 (Searle 1976:\n12). The gist of expressives is that they express the speaker\u2019s psychological\nattitude or state, like joy, grief, sorrow, etc. Acts of \u2018thanking\u2019, \u2018congratulating\u2019,\n\u2018apologizing\u2019, \u2018condoling\u2019, \u2018deploring\u2019 and \u2018welcoming\u2019 are paradigmatic cases\nof expressives. Sentence (21) illustrates this type:\n(21) What a wonderful paper, Mark!\n5. Declarations. Searle points out that they \u2018are a very special category of speech\nacts\u2019. Declaratives \u2018bring about some alternation to the status or condition of\nthe referred-to object or objects solely in virtue of the fact that the declaration\nhas been successfully performed\u2019. However, the successful performance of\ndeclarations requires the existence of an extra-linguistic institution in which\nthe speaker and the hearer occupy special places. \u2018The direction of fit is both\nwords-to-world and world-to-words ... there is no sincerity condition\u2019 (Searle\n1976: 14f.). Paradigmatic cases of declarations are successful acts of \u2018appointing\u2019, Pragmatics and philosophy 27\n\u2018nominating\u2019, \u2018marrying\u2019, \u2018christening\u2019, \u2018excommunicating\u2019, \u2018declaring war\u2019,\n\u2018resigning\u2019, and \u2018firing (from employment)\u2019. Example (22) illustrates this type:\n(22) I now pronounce you Man and Wife.12\n1.3.5 Direct and indirect speech acts\nAnother important distinction Searle makes in his speech act theory is the distinction\nbetween direct and indirect speech acts. We all know that we can say one thing that has\na specific meaning but that also means something else. A sentence like example (23):\n(23) Can you pass the salt?\nis at first sight a question. However, we all understand that this question about a\nspecific ability of a hearer is also a request addressed to the hearer that should make\nhim pass the salt to the speaker. In sentences (24) and (25) \u2013 the former being a request\nand the latter being a grammatical imperative \u2013 we observe a direct match between the\nsentence type and its illocutionary force. These sentences illustrate direct speech acts:\n(24) I request you to pass the salt.\n(25) Pass the salt, please.\nIn sentence (23), however, we observe that there is \u2018an ulterior illocutionary point\nbeyond the illocutionary point contained in the meaning of the sentence\u2019 (Searle 1975:\n74). This sentence illustrates an indirect speech act. Another way of defining indirect\nspeech acts is to define them as utterances \u2018in which one illocutionary act is performed\nindirectly by performing another\u2019 (Searle 1975: 60). Thus, in indirect speech acts we\nobserve a difference between what is said and what is actually meant by the speaker.\nEspecially with requests we observe that most of them are actually realized as indirect\nspeech acts. Explicit requests and imperatives (as illustrated in sentences (24) and (25))\nare rather rarely used in actual conversations. Stephen Levinson (1983: 264f.) points\nout that speakers of English \u2018could construct an indefinitely long list of ways of\nindirectly requesting an addressee\u2019 to do something like, e.g. passing the salt or closing\nthe door. He presents the following (non-exhaustive list of) examples:\n(26) a. I want you to close the door.\nI\u2019d be much obliged if you\u2019d close the door.\nb. Can you close the door?\nAre you able by any chance to close the door?\nc. Would you close the door?\nWon\u2019t you close the door?\nd. Would you mind closing the door?\nWould you be willing closing the door?\ne. You ought to close the door.\nIt might help to close the door. 28 Understanding pragmatics\nHadn\u2019t you better close the door?\nf. May I ask you to close the door?\nWould you mind awfully if I were to ask you to close the door?\nI am sorry to have to tell you to please close the door.\ng. Did you forget the door?\nDo us a favour with the door, love.\nHow about a bit less breeze?\nNow Johnny, what do big people do when they come in?\nOkay, Johnny, what am I going to say next?\nSearle explains these speech acts as follows:\nIn indirect speech acts the speaker communicates to the hearer more than he actually\nsays by way of relying on their mutually shared background, both linguistic and\nnonlinguistic, together with the general powers of rationality and inference on the part\nof the hearer ... [T]he apparatus necessary to explain the indirect part of the indirect\nspeech act includes a theory of speech acts, certain general principles of cooperative\nconversations ... and mutually shared factual background information of the speaker\nand the hearer, together with the ability on the part of the hearer to make inferences.\n(Searle 1975: 60f.)\nThe hearer uses the cooperative principle of conversation (which will be discussed in\nsection 1.5 in connection with H. Paul Grice\u2019s theory of implicature and conversational\nmaxims) to recognize that there is an ulterior illocutionary point beyond the\nillocutionary point contained in the meaning of the utterance. The speaker then\nmakes inferences about what this ulterior illocutionary point \u2013 the real force of the\nutterance \u2013 is on the basis of his background information about the situation and\ncontext in which the indirect speech act is produced and on his general knowledge\nabout the function and felicity conditions of speech acts (see Searle 1975: 74). Thus, in\nexample (23) the hearer would recognize that this sentence \u2018infringes the felicity\ncondition for the speech act of questioning and queries the preparatory condition for\nthat of requesting\u2019 (Huang 2007: 112) and would thus realize that this utterance is an\nindirect speech act.13 The hearer then follows the cooperative principle in conversation\nthat operates on both the speaker and the hearer and makes the inference that the\nspeaker wants him to pass the salt. Searle (1975: 61) points out that many indirect\nspeech acts are conventionalized and idiomatically used (see Searle 1975: 69) \u2013 mainly\nbecause of reasons of politeness: \u2018Politeness is the most prominent motivation for\nindirectness in requests, and certain forms naturally tend to become the conventionally\npolite ways of making indirect requests\u2019 (Searle 1975: 76).\nThe complex domain of politeness cannot be discussed here (see Brown and\nLevinson 1978), however, it should be noted that it is difficult to clearly differentiate\nindirect speech acts from Austin\u2019s perlocutionary acts. Pieter Seuren comments on\nthis as follows: Pragmatics and philosophy 29\nA perlocutionary act is defined as a speech act whose communicative function is to be\nderived by means of sensible social reasoning, as when I say It\u2019s cold in here, hoping that\nyou will take the hint and turn the heating up or shut the window, as the case may be ...\n... Indirect speech acts, including perlocutionary acts, are often subject to social and/\nor linguistic convention, which has to be learned in order to participate adequately in\na society...\n... [The] indirect-speech-act character [of utterances like (23) above, G. S.] is\naccounted for by an appeal to social, not linguistic, competence. Thus considered,\nindirect speech acts and perlocutionary acts are of a kind, differing only in the extent\nto which the intended practical result is reflected in the words used: indirect speech\nacts are more direct expressions of the result intended than perlocutionary acts.\n(Seuren 2009: 143)\n1.3.6 Speech act theory from a cross-cultural perspective\nAs we have already seen in the example Austin (1962: 27) provides to illustrate\nviolations of the felicity condition A (i) of performatives (see subsection 1.2.1 above),\nspeech acts can be highly culture-specific \u2013 like speech acts that will constitute a\ndivorce with a Muslim couple, but not with a Christian one. And many sociolinguists\nand anthropological linguists have confirmed this fact.\nKeith Basso (1979), for example, shows in his research on the joking behaviour of\nAthabaskan Indians how they ridicule compliments made by white North Americans;\nthey feel embarrassed by these, in their minds, excessive expressions of approval (see\nalso Chen 1993; Daikuhara 1986).\nJohn Gumperz (1979) investigated interactions between British-English and Indian-\nEnglish speakers in England and found that culture-specific differences in expectations\nof verbal behaviour resulted in miscommunication which made it difficult for\ninteractants to recognize whether a question was asked, an argument was put forward,\nwhether a speaker was polite or rude, etc.\nDeborah Tannen (1981) showed that notions like directness and indirectness differ\nsubstantially between Greek-Americans and Americans. Even Americans of Greek\norigin who no longer speak Greek stick to Greek norms for verbal indirectness \u2013 even\nat the risk of being misunderstood by the more \u2018direct\u2019 Americans. And they often\ninterpret directly meant utterances as verbal indirectness. The following example of a\nbrief interaction between a Greek-American husband and his American wife illustrates\nthis point (Tannen 1981: 227):\nHusband: Let\u2019s go visit my boss tonight.\nWife: Why?\nHusband: All right, we don\u2019t have to go.\nTannen explains what is going on here as follows:\nBoth husband and wife agreed that the husband\u2019s initial proposal was an indication\nthat he wanted to visit his boss. However, they disagreed on the meaning of the wife\u2019s 30 Understanding pragmatics\nquestion. \u201cWhy?\u201d The wife explained that she meant it as a request for information.\nTherefore she was confused and frustrated and could not help wondering why she\nmarried such an erratic man who suddenly changed his mind only a moment after\nmaking a request. The husband, for his part, explained that his wife\u2019s question clearly\nmeant that she did not want to go, and he therefore rescinded his request. He was\nfrustrated, however, and resentful of her refusing.\n(Tannen 1981: 227)\nShoshona Blum-Kulka and her colleagues (1989) found in their large-scale Cross-\nCultural Speech Act Realization Patterns Project great differences with respect to the\ndirectness and indirectness of requests and apologies in seven languages.\nHarris (1984) notes that the Australian Aboriginal language spoken in north-east\nArnhem Land does not contain anything comparable to our speech act of thanking.\nOn the other hand, Hudson (1985) found in the Australian Aboriginal language\nWalmajari a specific \u2018speech act of requesting that is based on kinship rights and\nobligations ... [which] is very difficult to refuse\u2019 (Huang 2007: 120f.).\nAnd in 1982 (= 2011) Michelle Rosaldo contrasted in her paper \u2018The things we do\nwith words\u2019 speech acts performed by Ilongots, former headhunters who live on Luzon\nIsland in the Philippines, with Searle\u2019s taxonomy of speech acts. Rosaldo (2011: 85) first\npoints out that for the Ilongots \u2018words are not made to \u201crepresent\u201d objective truth,\nbecause all truth is relative to the relationships and experiences of those who claim to\n\u201cknow\u201d... For Ilongots ... it\u2019s relations, not intentions, that come first\u2019. Then she\ncompares Searle\u2019s speech act types with Ilongot names for acts of speech, filing the\ncaveat that \u2018accounts of verbal action cannot reasonably proceed without attention to\nthe relations between social order, folk ideas about the world, and styles of speaking\u2019\n(Rosaldo 2011: 88).\nIn comparison with Searle\u2019s assertives the Ilongot are not so much interested in\npursuing truths:\nRather than pursuing truth, Ilongot speakers seem inclined to grant each other\nprivileged claims to things that all, as individuals, may claim to \u2018know\u2019. And so much\nless concerned with factual detail than with the question as to who withholds, and who\nreveals, a knowledge of well-bruited fact \u2013 Ilongots use denial and assertion in\ndiscourse as a device for the establishment of interactional roles.\n(Rosaldo 2011: 89)\nAs to directives, Rosaldo points out that for the Ilongot commands and other \u2018directive\nutterances [are] the very stuff of language: knowing how to speak [is] itself virtually\nidentical to knowing how and when to act\u2019 (Rosaldo 2011: 84). Overt performatives are\nrather rare, though. However, when they are performed they are neither constructed\nnor perceived as impolite or harsh. The force of directive acts performed is indicated\nby the use of \u2018recognized and stereotyped formulae\u2019 (Rosaldo 2011: 90).\nRosaldo had difficulties to find commissives in the Ilongot language. She points out\nthat the closest equivalent to the English word \u2018promise\u2019 is the Ilongot word which Pragmatics and philosophy 31\nrefers to \u2018a formulaic oath by salt, wherein participants declare that if their words prove\nfalse, their lives, like salt, will be dissolved\u2019 (Rosaldo 2011: 94).\nIlongot speech acts that are somehow related to Searle\u2019s category of declarations are\nthose \u2018whose power depends not on a human interlocutor\u2019s ear, but the attention of\ndiffuse, yet ever present supernatural forces\u2019.\nIn her study, Rosaldo (2011: 78) reveals the \u2018individualistic and relatively asocial\nbiases of [Searle\u2019s] essentially intra-cultural account\u2019 of speech acts. She closes her\narticle as follows:\nReflections on Ilongot notions concerning acts of speech should serve then as a\nreminder that the understanding of linguistic action always, and necessarily, demands\nmuch more than an account of what it is that individuals intend to say: because, as\nIlongots themselves are well aware, the \u2018force\u2019 of acts of speech depends on things\nparticipants expect, and then again, because, as our comparison makes clear, such\nexpectations are themselves the products of particular forms of sociocultural being.\n(Rosaldo 2011: 78)\nWith this impressive refutation of possible claims of the universality of (Searle\u2019s and\nAustin\u2019s) speech act theory this section ends.\nThe next section of this chapter briefly presents some of Pieter Seuren\u2019s (2009)\nthoughts on the socially binding force of speech acts which are based on his conviction\nthat speech acts constitute and create social reality. Austin\u2019s and Searle\u2019s speech act\ntheory lacks this notion of social reality \u2013 and this explains some of the criticisms like\nthose by Rosaldo quoted above.\n1.4 PIETER SEUREN ON THE SOCIALLY BINDING FORCE OF SPEECH ACTS\nIn the fourth chapter of his monograph Language in Cognition, the first volume of his\ntwo-volume work on Language from Within, Pieter A. M. Seuren (2009) points out that\nboth Austin\u2019s and Searle\u2019s thoughts on speech acts lack a notion of what he calls \u2018social\nreality\u2019 (Seuren 2011 p.c.). In this chapter on speech acts he devotes \u2018specific attention\nto the socially binding force of speech acts\u2019 and starts his line of thought by formulating\nthe \u2018PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL BINDING\u2019 which he considers \u2018to be axiomatic and\ndefining not only for human language but also for all other systems of human and\nnonhuman conscious communication\u2019 (Seuren 2009: 140). The principle runs:\nEvery serious linguistic utterance ... has a FORCE in that it creates a socially binding\nrelation consisting in either a COMMITMENT (of varying strength) on the part of the\nspeaker, or an APPEAL (of varying strength) issued to the listener(s), or the\nINSTITUTION OF A RULE OF BEHAVIOUR with regard to the proposition expressed\nin [the utterance], or an APPELATION, as in vocatives (\u2018Hey, you over there!\u2019).\nThe social partners with regard to whom the speech act is valid form the FORCE\nFIELD of [the utterance].\n(Seuren 2009: 140) 32 Understanding pragmatics\nFor Seuren this principle binds persons who have certain rights and duties, who have\nresponsibilities and personal dignity. These persons are \u2018... accountable and every\nserious speech act creates an accountability relation, no matter how trivial or\ninsignificant, between speaker and listener\u2019 (Seuren 2009: 140). Characterizing the\nprinciple of social binding as being \u2018axiomatic\u2019 and \u2018defining\u2019 not only for human\nlanguage but also for \u2018any form of communication by means of signs\u2019 (see also Seuren\n2009: 158) means for this scholar \u2018that language is primarily an instrument for the\ncreation of accountability relations and not for the transfer of information\u2019 (Seuren\n2009: 140). He develops these ideas in connection with speech acts and emphasizes\nthat\nall speech acts ... are performative in that they create a socially binding relation or state\nof affairs ... [T]he primary function of language is not \u2018communication\u2019, in the sense of\na transfer of information about the world, but social binding, that is, the creation of\nspecific interpersonal, socially binding relations with regard to the proposition\nexpressed by an utterance or speech act. It will be clear that this kind of social binding\nis a central element in the social fabric that is a necessary requirement for human\ncommunities.\n(Seuren 2009: 147).14\nSeuren argues that the neglect of the socially binding aspect of speech in philosophy\nand other disciplines has resulted in putting emphasis on the \u2018intention aspect of\nspeech acts ... and not ... on what is ACTUALLY ACHIEVED when the speaker\nproduces a speech act\u2019 (Seuren 2009: 150). According to Seuren, this \u2018basic blindness to\nthe socially binding aspect ... has given rise to a number of discussions regarding\ninsincere speech acts\u2019 (Seuren 2009: 150) and he illustrates this discussion with his\ncritique of Searle\u2019s analysis of promises (presented in subsection 1.3.2 [see also 1.3.3]\nabove). This critique cannot be outlined in detail here, but the following quote\nsummarizes the gist of Seuren\u2019s arguments:\nThe use of sentences like ... Searle\u2019s I promise to do but I do not intend to do [the act]\nundermines the implicit social pact upon which all speech acts are based and thus\nthe effectiveness of the speech act in question. In general, speech acts are valid on\naccount of their having been uttered under appropriate conditions. Their validity is\npart of the semantics of the language in question since it is bound up with the system\nof the language at type level. Speech acts are effective in virtue of the presumption of\nthe speaker being a properly functioning social being. The effectiveness of a speech\nact appears to be a matter of PRAGMATICS, as it is bound up with the circumstances\nin which sentences are uttered. For a speech act to be effective, it must (a) be\nperformed in a valid way, that is, uttered under appropriate conditions, and (b) be\nsupported by a presumption of social competence. When condition (b) is unfulfilled,\nthe speech act may still be (semantically) valid, but it is (pragmatically) futile and\nthus not effective.\n(Seuren 2009: 153) Pragmatics and philosophy 33\nWith this thought-provoking quote this brief presentation of some of Pieter Seuren\u2019s\nthoughts on speech acts comes to its end. However, it needs to be pointed out that the\nidea of a \u2018social contract\u2019 (Rousseau 1762) function of speech will recur in other chapters\nin this book.\nThe last section of this chapter comes back to the cooperative principle of\nconversation Searle referred to in his theory of indirect speech acts. This cooperative\nprinciple and its four subcases were formulated by H. Paul Grice, another colleague of\nAustin\u2019s and Searle\u2019s, in his theory of conversational implicature.\n1.5 MAXIMS THAT GUIDE CONVERSATION: H. PAUL GRICE\u2019S THEORY OF\nCONVERSATIONAL IMPLICATURE\nAfter a brief introduction to H. Paul Grice\u2019s theory, this section presents Grice\u2019s\nCooperative Principle and its constitutive conversational maxims. It illustrates how\nthese maxims can be violated or \u2018flouted\u2019, and presents the characteristic properties of\nimplicatures. This section ends with a brief look at Grice\u2019s theory from an\nanthropological-linguistic point of view.\n1.5.1 Introduction\nLike Austin and Searle, Grice was also very much interested in how speakers assign\nmeanings to utterances that are produced in certain contexts. In his William James\nLectures delivered at Harvard University in 1967 \u2013 excerpts of which were published in\ntwo articles in 1975 and 1978 \u2013 Grice formulates his theory of \u2018conversational implicature\u2019.\nLike the other philosophers who founded the school of Ordinary Language Philosophy,\nGrice was aware of the tension between logic and ordinary language as pointed out by the\nvery title of his lectures: \u2018Logic and Conversation\u2019. Like his colleagues he was convinced\nthat (formal) logic is not the only means to decide whether a sentence is meaningful. In\nthe discussion of indirect speech acts in 1.3.5 above, it was pointed out that there is a\ndifference between what is said and what is actually meant \u2013 one could also say what is\nimplicated \u2013 by the speaker. The hearer has to make certain inferences to recognize and\nunderstand this actual meaning which is implicated by the speaker in what he or she\nsaid. Levinson (2000: 11) defines the notion of \u2018a generalized conversational implicature\n[as] a default inference, one that captures our intuitions about a preferred or normal\ninterpretation\u2019 of a sentence, an utterance, a conversation or a text. Thus, if a speaker\nutters for example a sentence like the following:\n(27) John has three cows.\na hearer will infer from this sentence that John has only three cows, and no more. And\nin the following dialogue;\n(28) A: Will you go to Mark\u2019s PhD party?\nB: I have to prepare my inaugural lecture. 34 Understanding pragmatics\nspeaker A will understand that speaker B implies with his or her answer (which is an\nindirect speech act \u2013 in Searle\u2019s terms) that he or she will not or cannot go to this\nparty.\n1.5.2 Grice\u2019s cooperation principle and its constitutive conversational maxims\nGrice (1975: 45) understands conversational implicatures \u2018as being essentially\nconnected with certain general features of discourse\u2019. These features include certain\nexpectations, mutually shared by interactants; and knowing \u2013 and knowledge about\n\u2013 these expectations enables both speaker and hearer to make inferences about each\nother\u2019s communicative behaviour \u2013 which for Grice is always purposive and rational.\nThus, as Levinson (2000: 14) points out, \u2018what is conversationally implicated is not\ncoded but rather inferred on the basis of some basic assumptions about the rational\nnature of conversational activity\u2019. On the basis of these assumptions interactants\nengaged in a conversation can rely on the fact that they are generally willing to\ncooperate and provide information that is relevant for the topic of their conversation.\nHowever, on the basis of these assumptions they can also exclude \u2018possible\nconversational moves ... as conversationally unsuitable\u2019 (Grice 1975: 45; see also\nSeuren 1998: 406). Grice formulates these \u2018basic assumptions about the rational\nnature of conversational activity\u2019 in his Cooperative Principle: \u2018Make your\nconversational contribution such as is required, at the state at which it occurs, by the\naccepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged\u2019 (Grice\n1975: 45).\nThis principle is constituted by four maxims which Grice explicitly characterizes as\nechoing the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804). These categories or\nconversational maxims, claimed to be generally valid, are \u2018Quantity, Quality, Relation,\nand Manner\u2019; they are defined as follows:\nThe category of QUANTITY relates to the quantity of information to be provided, and\nunder it fall the following maxims:\n1. Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of\nthe exchange).\n2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.\nUnder the category of QUALITY falls a supermaxim \u2013 \u2018Try to make your contribution\none that is true\u2019 \u2013 and two more specific maxims:\n1. Do not say what you believe to be false.\n2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\nUnder the category RELATION I place a single maxim, namely, \u2018Be relevant\u2019.\nFinally, under the category of MANNER, which I understand as relating not (like the\nprevious categories) to what is said but, rather, to HOW what is said is to be said, I\ninclude the supermaxim \u2018Be perspicuous\u2019 and various maxims such as: Pragmatics and philosophy 35\n1. Avoid obscurity of expression.\n2. Avoid ambiguity.\n3. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).\n4. Be orderly.\n(Grice 1975: 45f.)\nAccording to Grice these four conversational maxims serve the basis for figuring out\nthe non-literal meaning of utterances like the one produced by speaker B in example\n(28) above.\n1.5.3 How the conversational maxims can be violated or \u2018flouted\u2019\nConversational maxims can be violated or \u2018flouted\u2019. Grice (1975: 51\u201356) provides\nexamples in which maxims are not violated, and examples in which they are flouted.\nIn what follows we will look at some of them.\nIn example (29) Grice provides an extract from an imaginary conversation in which\nno maxim is violated:\n(29) A: Smith doesn\u2019t seem to have a girlfriend these days.\nB: He has been paying a lot of visits to New York lately.\nGrice comments on this as follows: In his reaction to speaker A\u2019s utterance speaker B\nimplicates that Smith has, or may have, a girlfriend in New York. That is to say with his\nutterance speaker B implies that Smith has or may have a girlfriend in New York by\nreferring to Smith\u2019s lately recurrent visits to New York \u2013 with this reaction he suggests\nor implies something by saying something else.\nIn example (30), Grice provides an extract from an imaginary conversation in which\na maxim is violated; however, he explains this violation by the supposition of a clash\nwith another maxim:\n(30) A: Where does C live?\nB: Somewhere in the South of France.\nGrice comments on this example as follows: Speaker A is planning to have a holiday in\nFrance, and both speaker A and B know that A wants to see his friend C, who lives in\nFrance \u2013 if this visit will not be too much of a detour. B\u2019s answer to A\u2019s question is\ncertainly less informative than required. However, this \u2018infringement of the first\nmaxim of Quantity can be explained ... by the supposition that B is aware that to be\nmore informative would be to say something that infringed the maxim of Quality,\n\u201cdon\u2019t say what you lack adequate evidence for\u201d\u2019 (Grice 1975: 51f.). Thus B implicates\nwith his answer that he does not really know where precisely C lives.\nThe following examples illustrate the flouting and infringements of maxims. Grice\npresents an imaginary testimonial delivered by a professor about one of his students\nwho applies for a university job as an example to illustrate the flouting of the first\nmaxim of Quantity: 36 Understanding pragmatics\n(31) Dear Sir,\nMr. X\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his attendance\nat tutorials has been regular.\nYours, etc.\nHe comments on this example as follows: The professor has to be cooperative in this\nsituation, he knows that more information is wanted, but he does not want to say more\nabout the student, although the addressee of the testimonial knows that this person is\nhis student; thus, instead of providing information about the student he is reluctant to\nwrite down, he prefers to flout the first maxim of Quantity, implicating that his student\nis not suited for the vacant job.\nAn example of a flouting of the second maxim of Quantity (Grice 1975: 52) would\nbe a situation in which speaker A wants to know whether a given proposition is true.\nSpeaker B, who knows whether the proposition is true, not only simply confirms the\ntruth of the proposition, but also volunteers further and uncalled for information on\nwhy it is certain that the proposition is true. Now, if it is felt that B does this on purpose,\nit could implicate that what B claims to be established truth is, in actual fact,\ncontroversial.\nGrice also illustrates violations of the maxim of Quality in ironic statements (as in\nspeaking about a rival as a \u2018fine friend\u2019), in metaphors (like \u2018You are the cream in my\ncoffee\u2019), and in understatements (like speaking about a drunken man who has broken\nall his furniture as if \u2018he was a little intoxicated\u2019). Figures of speech like irony, metaphor\nand understatement are paradigmatic examples of implicatures.\nAs an example \u2018in which an implicature is achieved by real, as distinct from apparent,\nviolation of the maxim of Relation\u2019 Grice (1975: 54) imagines the following situation\nillustrated in example (32), meant to occur \u2018at a genteel tea party\u2019:\n(32) A: Mrs. X is an old bag.\n(silence)\nB: The weather has been quite delightful this summer, hasn\u2019t it?\nAfter the utterance of speaker A there is a moment of embarrassed silence. Then\nspeaker B produces his utterance about the weather, blatantly refusing to make what\nhe or she says relevant to A\u2019s preceding remark. With this, speaker B implicates not\nonly that A\u2019s remark should be ignored, but also that A has committed a social faux\npas.\nThese examples of how conversational maxims can be violated should suffice for the\npurpose pursued here.\n1.5.4 Five properties of implicatures\nGrice assumes that the properties implicatures have are easy to predict. Implicatures\ncan be distinguished from other deductive processes (like presuppositions) by five\ncharacteristic properties (see Grice 1975: 50, especially 57f.; see also 1978: 116). Pragmatics and philosophy 37\nFirst of all, Grice points out that all conversational implicatures are cancellable or\ndefeasible. Levinson (2000: 42) illustrates this property as follows:\na. Assertion: \u2018John ate some of the cookies.\u2019\nb. Default implicature: \u2018John did not eat all of the cookies.\u2019\nc. Cancellation of b: \u2018John ate some of the cookies. In fact he ate all of them.\u2019\nSecond, implicatures are non-detachable, which means the implicature attaches to the\nmeaning of the utterance, not to any specific lexical item or sentence form chosen to\nexpress the meaning.\nThus\nJohn is no rocket scientist.\nnot an Einstein.\nnot a candidate for the Nobel Prize in physics, etc.\nall implicate \u2018John is not very smart\u2019.\n(Lakoff 1995: 193f.)\nThird, implicatures are calculable. That is to say, \u2018the relation between the implicature-\ninvoking utterance and its maxim-observing equivalent can be ... rigorously and\nspecifically expressed as in the example ... \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d\u2019. In this utterance \u2018the\nsuperficial tautology requires some computation to be understood non-tautologously,\ni.e. as \u201cboys share certain salient behavioral features\u201d\u2019 (Lakoff 1995: 193f.).\nFourth, implicatures are non-conventional. This means that an implicature is \u2018not\npart of the \u201cdictionary\u201d meaning of any of the words involved\u2019 (Lakoff 1995: 194). To\nunderstand the meaning of the sentences Lakoff provides for illustrating the fact that\nimplicatures are non-detachable (John is no rocket scientist, etc.) a dictionary of\nEnglish need not define \u2018rocket scientist\u2019 as \u2018a smart person\u2019.\nAnd fifth, implicatures are not fully determinable, that is to say \u2018there is no one-to-\none linkage between the form of an implicature and its intended meaning:\nJohn is a machine\nmight mean \u201cJohn is unemotional\u201d, \u201cJohn is a hard worker\u201d, \u201cJohn is efficient\u201d, etc.\u2019\n(Lakoff 1995: 194).\n1.5.5 Grice\u2019s theory from an anthropological-linguistic perspective\nElinor (Ochs) Keenan (1976: 67) rightly points out that Grice presented his theory of\nconversational implicature \u2018as universal in application\u2019. Keenan was the first scholar\nwho examined Grice\u2019s analysis of conversational maxims and implicatures in a non-\nIndo-European language, namely in Malagasy. She shows that speakers of Malagasy\nregularly violate Grice\u2019s maxim of Quantity (\u2018Be informative\u2019) by providing less\ninformation than is required by their conversational partners, pointing out that\nspeakers are reluctant to make explicit reference both with respect to past and future 38 Understanding pragmatics\nevents, and she notes that speakers in general do not expect that their interlocutors will\nsatisfy their informational needs. Moreover, Keenan points out that Malagasy speakers\nare more likely to withhold significant information than not so significant information,\nespecially if imparting a certain information may have unpleasant consequences for\nthe speaker (like information relating to misdeeds of other people). However, if\ninterlocutors are close kinspersons or neighbours, they are inclined to provide more\nexplicit information for each other, and women are more likely to satisfy the\ninformational needs of their partners in conversation than men (Keenan 1976: 70ff.).\nAt the end of her study Keenan points out that \u2018Grice tantalizes the ethnographer with\nthe possibility of an etic grid for conversation ... The conversational maxims are not\npresented as working hypotheses but as social facts\u2019 (Keenan 1976: 79). Anthropological\nlinguists and linguistic anthropologists agree that every etic grid, i.e. every approach\nbased on Western cultural norms and ideas to ethnolinguistic problems (see subsection\n4.4.2 below), is sooner or later doomed to fail to grasp the essential facts in the (non-\nWestern) language and culture investigated. Therefore, an etic grid such as the one\nprovided by the Gricean maxims can only be of secondary importance for linguistic\nanthropologists. Nevertheless, Keenan sketched a way in which the Gricean framework\ncould be used for anthropological-linguistic research. She states that:\n[w]e can \u2026 take any one maxim and note when it does and does not hold. The\nmotivation for its use or abuse may reveal values and orientations that separate one\nsociety from another and that separate social groups \u2026 within a single society\nand she evaluates Grice\u2019s proposals as providing \u2018a point of departure for ethnographers\nwho wish to integrate their observations, and to propose stronger hypotheses related\nto general principles of conversation\u2019 (Keenan 1976: 79).\nSenft (2008) showed that the Gricean maxims of Quality and Manner do not hold\neither for Kilivila, especially not for highly ritualized forms of speech and for the so-\ncalled \u2018biga sopa\u2019 variety of Kilivila, the \u2018joking or lying speech, the indirect speech\u2019\nwhich is the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 default speech variety. Senft (2008: 144f.) also referred\nto Haiman\u2019s book Talk is Cheap in which the author points out that for many linguists\nand certainly for philosophers of language inspired by Grice the \u2018bedrock of\nconversation is plain referential speaking\u2019 (Haiman 1998: 99). However, in the\npostscript of his book Haiman justifies his choice for dealing with un-plain speaking\nand summarizes the arguments he put forward as follows:\nI concluded with the claim that the ritualization or emancipation process, which\ntransforms sincere spontaneous acts and utterances into autonomous and meaningless\nformal codes, not only is responsible for apparent excrescences such as sarcasm, formal\npoliteness, phatic communion, ritual speech, and affectation but also is a significant\npart of human nature and therefore the very essence of culture itself and may have\nplayed a necessarily undocumented role in the origin of human language.\n(Haiman 1998: 190) Pragmatics and philosophy 39\nThis implies that Gricean maxims are based on a rather uni-dimensional\nunderstanding of language and conversation. Of course, there is plain conversation \u2013\nbut how do Gricean maxims deal with all the cases of \u2018un-plain speaking\u2019 which \u2013 as\nHaiman claims \u2013 may be much more important for both linguists and philosophers of\nlanguage in their search for finding \u2018the essence of language\u2019 (Haiman 1998: 191)? If\nthe Gricean maxims can cope neither with forms of ritual communication nor with\n\u2018un-plain\u2019 forms of speech and communication, they neglect an incredibly broad\nspectrum of language use. And if they only refer to \u2018plain referential speaking\u2019, then\nthey have to cope with criticisms like that of Kiefer (1979: 57) who criticizes the linguist\nand philosopher for being \u2018extremely vague so \u201cthat almost anything can be worked\nout on the basis of almost any meaning\u201d (Sadock 1978: 285). This means that the\ntheory is unfalsifiable, vacuous, and therefore of no explanatory value\u2019.\n1.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis chapter presented Austin\u2019s and Searle\u2019s versions of speech act theory and Grice\u2019s\ntheory of conversational implicature. All three philosophers and their ideas about\nlanguage had a strong and important impact on linguistics in general and on\npragmatics in particular. Their insights \u2013 which are core issues in linguistic pragmatics\n\u2013 can be summarized as follows:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Speech acts are manifestations of language as action that \u2013 driven by intentions of\nspeakers \u2013 cause effects and thus have psychological and behavioural consequences\nin speaker\u2013hearer interactions.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) There is a difference between the way in which an utterance is used and the\nmeaning that is expressed by this utterance in certain contexts.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Speakers may say one thing that has a specific meaning but that also means\nsomething else in certain circumstances because of certain social conventions that\nare valid within a specific speech community.\nAustin, Searle and Grice have certainly co-founded and shaped the discipline and they\nhave initiated important and innovative research within the field \u2013 as demonstrated by\nthe brief presentation of Pieter Seuren\u2019s recent thoughts on the socially binding force of\nspeech acts. Seuren puts his emphasis on the social reality in which speech acts are\nperformed, pointing out their socially binding force. For him speech acts create\naccountability relations, they can be seen as a social pact between speaker and hearer\nwhich is based on conventions and requires social competence of the interactants.\nHowever, this chapter also revealed that the philosophy of language in which Austin\u2019s,\nSearle\u2019s and Grice\u2019s theories are rooted is based on West-European and Anglo-American\ntraditions and ways of thinking. This is one of the reasons, if not the most important one,\nthat some of the claims that these philosophers make do not hold for Non-Standard Average\nEuropean languages and cultures. Nevertheless, as Keenan (1976: 79) rightly points out,\nspeech act theory and the theory of conversational implicature provide an extremely useful 40 Understanding pragmatics\n\u2018point of departure\u2019 also \u2018for ethnographers who wish to integrate their observations, and to\npropose stronger hypotheses related to general principles of conversation\u2019.\nWhat does this chapter tell us about the anecdote which I reported in the introduction\nto this volume, claiming that my misunderstanding of the Trobriand Islanders\nquestion is exemplary for what this book is about? We now know that I misunderstood\na complex speech act as a simple request for information. I had to learn that this\nquestion in this specific context was inextricably intertwined with a convention that\nmade it not only a form of greeting with an important bonding function but also an\neffective means of social control for the village community. I had to learn this\nconvention and thus to acquire the social competence necessary to appropriately react\nto this speech act with the pragmatically effective response. I also had to learn that this\nresponse needed to respect the Gricean maxim of Quantity \u2013 \u2018Make your contribution\nas informative as is required\u2019; otherwise the response would violate the social pact\nconstitutive for the bonding function of this culture-specific speech act.\n1.7 EXERCISE/WORK SECTION\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Provide examples for constative and for performative sentences.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) When is a performative utterance \u2018unhappy/infelicitous\u2019? Provide examples and\nexplain which felicity conditions are not fulfilled by them. Which of these unhappy\nperformative utterances are \u2018misfires\u2019 and which are \u2018abuses\u2019? Explain why.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Analyse the illocutionary speech acts Request, Question, Thank (for), Advise,\nWarn and Congratulate on the basis of their felicity conditions.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Provide examples for Representatives, Directives, Commissives, Expressives and\nDeclarations.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Videotape your friends or family having dinner together. Then look for indirect\nspeech acts performed, transcribe them and comment on these acts and on the\ncontexts in which they were produced.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Imagine a teacher entering a classroom.

What utterances may the teacher produce\nto make the pupils close the window?\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Provide and discuss (at least three) examples in which non-native speakers of your\nmother-tongue have to be familiar with certain culture-specific conventions valid\nwithin your speech community to be able to properly react to certain speech acts\nin specific contexts.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Discuss (neglected? implied? constitutive?) social aspects of speech acts and of\nGrice\u2019s theory of conversational implicature.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Provide (at least three) examples (each) of imaginary or real conversation in which\nGrice\u2019s conversational maxims are flouted and briefly discuss them.

Other such functions are\n\u2018the speaker\u2019s demonstration of rank or status or the expression of the speaker\u2019s desire to\nbelong to a particular social group\u2019 (Seuren 2009: 148). 2\nPragmatics and psychology\nDeictic reference and gesture\n2.1 INTRODUCTION\nHow do speakers of different languages refer to objects, persons, animals, places,\nperiods of time and even texts or text passages? When speakers make these so-called\n\u2018deictic\u2019 references, they communicate in certain \u2013 linguistic and non-linguistic \u2013\ncontexts, and these contexts influence the shape of our utterances. Natural languages\nare context-bound \u2013 and it is deixis that \u2018concerns the ways in which languages encode\nor grammaticalize features of the context of utterance or speech event, and thus also\nconcerns ways in which the interpretation of utterances depends on the analysis of that\ncontext of utterance\u2019 (Levinson 1983: 54; see also Senft 2004a: 1). This context-\ndependence of linguistic reference is known as \u2018indexicality\u2019 and it is taken by\nphilosophers such as Hilary Putnam (1975: 187; see also 193) as a \u2018constitutive feature\nof human language\u2019 and a general characteristic of language and interaction.\nIndexicality can broadly be defined as \u2018the study of expressions relying on the context\nof use to select items of discourse\u2019 (Corazza 2010: 1).\nIn the first part of this chapter, the phenomenon of deixis is presented and discussed.\nThe historically most influential contribution on the topic of deixis was presented by\nthe German psychologist Karl B\u00fchler (1879\u20131963) in his by now classic work\nSprachtheorie: Die Darstellungsfunktion der Sprache (Theory of Language: The\nrepresentational function of language [B\u00fchler 1934; 1990]). Although B\u00fchler\u2019s work is\nstill not really known in the USA, despite the fact that a translation of his seminal\nvolume was published in 1990, it is a fact that research on deixis so far has been deeply\nindebted to B\u00fchler\u2019s insights into this topic (see Kendon 2004: 57ff.).\nAfter a general introduction to the topic, a cross-linguistic comparison of language-\nspecific forms of spatial deixis illustrates the broad variety of the means languages\noffer their speakers for this kind of deictic reference. The first part of this chapter ends\nwith the description of the complex deictic system of Kilivila.\nThe term \u2018deixis\u2019 is borrowed from the Greek word for \u2018pointing\u2019 or \u2018indicating\u2019\n(B\u00fchler 1934: 36f.; 1990: 44f.). We not only \u2018point\u2019 with words, but also with gestures. The\nsecond part of this chapter deals with these deictic gestures and with speech accompanying\ngestures in general. Again it was a German psychologist \u2013 Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920)\n\u2013 whose discussion of gestures and sign languages in the first volume (Wundt 1900) of\nhis seminal work V\u00f6lkerpsychologie1 (Wundt 1900\u20131920) set standards for the study of\ngestures and sign languages. Wundt\u2019s groundbreaking insights were taken up by\npsychologists like Adam Kendon, David McNeill and Susan Goldin-Meadow \u2013 who Pragmatics and psychology 43\nbecame pioneers of modern gesture research. This part of Chapter Two presents and\ndiscusses the various types of gesture and their communicative functions, based on\nresearch results published by these pioneers and other specialists in gesture research.\n2.2 DEICTIC REFERENCE2\nCharles Fillmore defines \u2018deixis\u2019 as follows:\nDeixis is the name given to uses of items and categories of lexicon and grammar that\nare controlled by certain details of the interactional situation in which the utterances\nare produced. These details include especially the identity of the participants in the\ncommunicating situation, their locations and orientation in space, whatever on-going\nindexing acts the participants may be performing, and the time at which the utterance\ncontaining the items is produced.\n(Fillmore 1982: 35)\nThe study of deixis has been an important subfield within (psycho-)linguistics,\nbecause, as Levinson (1997: 219) points out, \u2018most sentences in most natural languages\nare deictically anchored, that is, they contain linguistic expressions with inbuilt\ncontextual parameters whose interpretation is relative to the context of utterance\u2019.\nThus, \u2018to know what exactly is meant by She brought this flower for me yesterday and\nwhether this statement is true, one first needs to know who uttered it, on what day, and\nwhere\u2019 (Bohnemeyer 2001: 3371); moreover, in this case one may also need a pointing\ngesture to identify the female referent and the flower that is referred to. Deictic terms\nor indexicals are expressions whose reference is highly context-dependent and shifts\nfrom context to context; they can be defined as follows:\nDeictic terms , such as here, there, I, you this, that, derive their interpretation in part from\nthe speaker/listener situation in which the utterance is made. Among these terms only\nhere, I, and in some cases you are directly referential; given the situation, their reference\nis unambiguous. The other deictic terms, however, require the speaker to make some\nform of pointing gesture, for example by nodding the head, visibly directing the gaze,\nturning the body, or moving arm and hand in the appropriate direction. Without such a\nparalinguistic gesture, the utterance is incomplete in an essential aspect.\n(Levelt et al. 1985: 134)3\nVeronika Ehrich (1992) understands \u2018deixis\u2019 as the general term for B\u00fchler\u2019s various\nZeigarten or \u2018kinds of pointing\u2019 (B\u00fchler 1934: 83; 1990: 97), and Zeigmodi or \u2018modes of\npointing\u2019 (B\u00fchler 1934: 80; 1990: 94). The following kinds of pointing (B\u00fchler\u2019s\n\u2018Zeigarten\u2019) can be differentiated:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Personal deixis allows distinctions among the speaker (\u2018I\u2019 = first person), the\naddressee (\u2018you\u2019 = second person) and everyone else (\u2018s/he\u2019, \u2018they\u2019, \u2018the spectators\u2019,\n\u2018the others\u2019, etc. = third person). 44 Understanding pragmatics\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Social deixis (\u2018mate\u2019, \u2018Sir\u2019, \u2018your honour\u2019, etc.) encodes \u2018the speaker\u2019s social\nrelationship to another party, frequently but not always the addressee, on a\ndimension of rank\u2019 (Levinson 1997: 218).\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Temporal deixis (\u2018now\u2019, \u2018today\u2019, \u2018next week\u2019, \u2018in 1952\u2019, etc.) \u2018allows the speaker to\npoint in time\u2019 (Trask 1999: 68).\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Spatial deixis (\u2018here\u2019, \u2018there\u2019, \u2018east\u2019, \u2018west\u2019, \u2018in front of\u2019, \u2018behind\u2019, \u2018left\u2019, \u2018right\u2019, etc.)\nallows pointing to spatial locations.\nIn addition, the following modes of pointing are differentiated by B\u00fchler:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) In the situative modus, situative deictic reference is made to referents within the\nperceived space of speaker and hearer (i.e. reference \u2018ad oculos\u2019 [reference in front\nof the eyes] in B\u00fchler\u2019s terms). The following sentence illustrates this modus of\npointing:\n(1) This is a steam engine.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) In anaphora we observe the non-deictic usage of expressions4 that refer to a (mental\nrepresentation of) a referent or segment mentioned earlier in an utterance,\ndiscourse, or text (see Dixon 2003: 111f.). The following little Dutch text illustrates\nanaphoric reference (with the use of the anaphoric third person singular pronoun\n\u2018hij\u2019 [he]):\n(2) F. C. Donders studeerde geneeskunde en fysiologie. In 1852 werd hij te Utrecht\nbenoemd tot hoogleraar.\nF. C. Donders studied medicine and physiology. In 1852 he was appointed as a\nprofessor in Utrecht.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) In cataphora we also observe the non-deictic usage of expressions that refer to a\nforthcoming (mental representation of a) referent or segment that will be explicitly\nintroduced in an utterance, discourse or text (see Dixon 2003: 111f.). The following\nlittle text illustrates cataphoric reference:\n(3) And here he comes, the man who first set foot on the Moon: Neil Armstrong!\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Imaginative deixis or transposed deixis (B\u00fchler\u2019s \u2018Deixis am Phantasma\u2019) refers to\nan imagined situation. This mode of reference is illustrated with the first sentence\nfrom Franz Kafka\u2019s famous novella Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis) in\nwhich the author \u2013 writing in German \u2013 sketches the situation in which his\nprotagonist finds himself as follows:\n(4) Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Tr\u00e4umen erwachte, fand er\nsich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer verwandelt.\nAs Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself\ntransformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.\nThe use of spatial deixis in this sentence which points to the place where the\nprotagonist of this work of fiction is situated is an example of imaginative deixis. Pragmatics and psychology 45\nImaginative or transposed deixis characterizes all forms of reference in fictive \u2013\nimagined \u2013 contexts.\nEhrich (1992: 17ff.) refers to anaphora, cataphora and imaginative deixis as \u2018discourse\ndeixis\u2019. Moreover, with situative deixis she distinguishes between the positional system\nof reference that localizes areas in space in relation to, and dependent on, the speaker\u2019s\nor the hearer\u2019s position \u2013 \u2018here\u2019 and \u2018there\u2019 in English, \u2018hier\u2019, \u2018da\u2019, \u2018dort\u2019 in German \u2013\nand the dimensional system of reference that defines relations in space dependent on\nthe speaker\u2019s or hearer\u2019s position and orientation \u2013 \u2018before (in front of)/behind, left/\nright, above/below\u2019 in English. There is an important difference between positional\nand dimensional deixis when used in indirect, reported speech. In reported speech,\nexpressions of positional deixis must be translated from the perspective of the speaker\nquoted into the perspective of the person who quotes. This observation can be clarified\nwith the following examples: assuming that the person who quotes and the person\nwho is quoted are not at the same place, a speaker\u2019s utterance like:\n(5a) It is beautiful here.\nmust be translated in reported speech into:\n(5b) He said it was beautiful there.\nWith expressions of dimensional deixis this translation is not possible. Anderson\nand Keenan refer to these phenomena with the technical term \u2018relativized deixis\u2019\nand emphasize that the \u2018nature of this process of relativization, and the syntactic and\ndiscourse contexts which condition it, are highly complex and poorly understood\u2019\n(Anderson and Keenan 1985: 301). The next subsection will concentrate on spatial\ndeixis.5\n2.3 SPATIAL DEIXIS\nLanguages differ fundamentally in how they refer to space. The Space Project of the\nMax Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics developed a typology of spatial systems\nor frames of spatial reference to describe these differences (Haviland 1998; Levinson\n2003; Pederson et al. 1998; Senft 1997a; 2001; see also subsection 4.3 below). The\ntypology defines three systems that are called \u2018relative\u2019, \u2018absolute\u2019, and \u2018intrinsic\u2019\nframes of reference. They differ with respect to how angles are projected from the\n\u2018ground\u2019 (or \u2018relatum\u2019) in order to situate the location of the \u2018figure\u2019 (or \u2018theme\u2019) that\nis referred to.6\nRelative systems are viewpoint-dependent: Localizations in space are derived from,\nand described on the basis of, the position and orientation of the speaker. In these\nsystems sentences like (6) \u2013 from English \u2013 and (7) \u2013 from Ewe, a language spoken in\nGhana and belonging to the Kwa family of Niger-Congo (Ameka and Essegbey 2006:\n385) \u2013 are understood from the speaker\u2019s point of view only; the references completely\nneglect the orientation of the man referred to. 46 Understanding pragmatics\n(6) The ball is to the right of the man.\n(7) E-ke, s\u00e9fofo-t\u00ed-\u03b5 v\u00e1 le emia\n3.SG-this flower-tree-DEF come be.at:PRS left\nme ye \u014butsu-(cid:1101) le d\u02dbus\u00ed\ncontaining_region and man-DEF be.at:PRS right\nme.\ncontaining_region\nThis one, the flower is on the left and the man is on the right.\nAbsolute systems operate on absolute concepts of direction. They are based on\nconventionalized directions or other fixed bearings that can be derived from\nmeteorological, astronomical, or landscape features. In these systems we find sentences\nlike (8) and (9) \u2013 from Yukatec Maya (Bohnemeyer and Stolz 2006: 304):\n(8) The ball is to the west of the man/uphill from the man/seawards to the man.\n(9) ... hun-t\u00faul p\u00e0al t\u00faun p\u00e0akat toh\none-CLF.AN child PROG:CRA.3 look straight\nxaman nohol k-u p\u2019\u00e1at-al le k\u2019\u00e0ax\nnorth south IMPF:A.3 leave\\ACAUS-INC DEF bush\nti\u2019-o\u2019\nLOC(CRB:3.SG)-DIST2\n... a child, it is looking straight north, the bush remains south of him.\nIntrinsic systems utilize inherent, intrinsic features of an object to derive a projected\nregion or to anchor the spatial reference to an object in these features. In these systems\nwe find sentences like (10) and (11) \u2013 from Tamil, a Dravidian language spoken in\nIndia (Pederson 2006: 432):\n(10) The ball is to the man\u2019s right.\n(11) en viiTTukkupinpakkattil kuTiyirukkiRaan\n1SG.OBL house-Dat+back+side-LOC reside-PRS-3SG.M\nHe is living on my house\u2019s backside\nSentence (10) is understood as follows: A man is an object with a front and back, a left\nand right side assigned to him. In intrinsic systems a sentence like (10) refers to the\nposition of the ball on the basis of the orientation of the man \u2013 the ball is at the right\nside of the man \u2013 the orientation of the speaker does not play any role whatsoever and\nis \u2013 within this system \u2013 completely irrelevant for the understanding of this sentence.\nThe same argument holds for sentence (11) \u2013 houses in the area of India, where Tamil\nis spoken, are objects with an intrinsic front and back \u2013 so the location of the living\nplace of the men referred to is also unequivocal.\nHowever, many speakers who use intrinsic systems for their spatial references also\nproduce in this situation instead of sentence (10), for example, sentence (6) to refer to Pragmatics and psychology 47\nthe same configuration of objects. This shows that languages like English (and German\nand many others) can be ambiguous with respect to whether they use an intrinsic or a\nrelative perspective in their spatial references (see also Clark 1973: 46). In such a\nsituation the meaning of the sentence can only be disambiguated in the actual situation\nand context.\nAll three systems can be found in a given language, and they can be utilized for\nspatial reference; however, many of the languages that have been studied so far\nfrequently seem to prefer one frame of reference in a particular context (see 2.3.1.4\nbelow).\nWhat kind of means do languages offer their speakers for spatial deictic reference?7\nIn many languages the repertoire of elementary linguistic means for spatial deictic\nreference encompasses:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) prepositions or postpositions (e.g.: at, on, in [topological prepositions], in front of,\nbehind, to the right [projective prepositions]);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) locatives, i.e. local or place adverbs (e.g.: here, there) and local nouns (referring to\nregions or areas);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) directionals (e.g.: towards, into, upwards, downwards, upstream);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) positional and motion verbs or verbal roots (e.g.: to stand, to come, to go, to bring,\nto take);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) presentatives (e.g.: voici, voil\u00e0, ecce, ecco, here is);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) demonstratives (e.g.: this, that).\nMoreover, we also find deictic gestures in all speech communities (see subsection 2.4.3\nbelow). The function of all these \u2018indexicals\u2019 is to localize, to inform about, and to\nidentify referents in space. However, we have to keep in mind that with deictic\nexpressions we must differentiate between deictic and non-deictic usages (see\nsubsection 2.2 above). As Levinson (1983: 65\u201368) illustrates, we must distinguish two\nkinds of deictic usage, namely gestural and symbolic usage. Within non-deictic usages,\nwe must distinguish anaphoric from non-anaphoric usages. These are Levinson\u2019s\nexamples:\n(12) \u2018You, you but not you are dismissed\u2019 (deictic, gestural usage).\n(13) \u2018This city stinks!\u2019 (deictic, symbolic usage).\n(14) \u2018I drove the car to the parking lot and left it there\u2019 (anaphoric usage).\n(15) \u2018There we go\u2019 (non-deictic and non-anaphoric usage).\nIn the languages of the world we find different systems of demonstrative elements. In\ntheir survey on deixis in various languages Anderson and Keenan (1985; for criticism\nsee Hanks 1987) present systems of spatial deictics that consist of two terms (e.g.:\nEnglish \u2018this, these/that, those\u2019, \u2018here, there\u2019), three terms (e.g.: Latin \u2018hic, iste, ille\u2019), and 48 Understanding pragmatics\nmore than three terms \u2013 like Sre (spoken in Vietnam \u2013 4 terms), Daga (spoken in\nPapua New Guinea \u2013 14 terms), and Alaskan Yup\u2019ik (over 30 terms). Denny (1985: 113,\n117\u2013120) mentions even 88 terms in East-Eskimo, an Inuit language spoken in the\nWestern Hudson Bay and on Baffin Island. Anderson and Keenan (1985: 308) draw\nthe conclusion that \u2018a minimal person/number system and at least a two-term spatial\ndemonstrative system seem to be universal\u2019.\nWith respect to the development of these systems, Heeschen \u2013 in connection with\nhis research on the Mek languages of West Papua \u2013 presents the following interesting\nhypothesis:\nAt the origin we have a pure deictic system ... These deictics can be substituted, or\naccompanied ... by a pointing gesture. The more the ... formations assume discourse\nfunctions \u2013 i. e., the more they refer not to points in concrete space but to items\npreviously mentioned in the linguistic context \u2013 the more they lose their potential for\npointing to those things which are truly \u201cup there\u201d or \u201cdown there\u201d.\n(Heeschen 1982: 92)\nDenny attempts to explain the differences between deictic systems for spatial reference\nas follows:\nIn a natural environment of non-human spaces one way to relate space to human\nactivity is to use deictic spatial concepts, to center space on the speaker (or other\nparticipant). In a man-made environment this is less necessary \u2013 non-deictic locatives\nsuch as down the road, through the door and around the corner will relate space to\nhuman acts quite directly since the places mentioned are all artifacts designed to aid\nsuch acts ... [A]s the degree to which the spatial environment is man-made increases,\nthe size of the spatial deictic system decreases.\n(Denny 1978: 80; see also 1985: 123\u2013125)\nHowever, it must be pointed out that this hypothesis is not undisputed.8\nOf all the various means languages offer their speakers for spatial deictic reference,\ndemonstratives seem to have attracted special attention in linguistics. Green (1995: 15),\nfor example, states that \u2018for many philosophers and linguists, demonstratives lie at the\nheart of deictic issues\u2019, and Hyslop (1993: 1) claims that \u2018the best way of studying the\nexpression of spatial deixis in language is via the system of demonstratives\u2019. And this\nspecial interest is very well documented in the literature.\nI just want to mention here two more studies that deal with the interactional use of\ndemonstratives. In his analyses of Lao demonstratives, Enfield (2003: 108f.) points out\nthat \u2018speakers frame their linguistic choices under the assumption of a maxim of\nrecipient design\u2019 (Sacks & Schegloff 1979). He convincingly shows that:\nspeakers tailor their utterance so that addressees are not required to make reference to\ninformation that the speaker knows or assumes they do not have access to. In turn,\naddressees EXPECT speakers\u2019 utterances to be tailored so as not to depend on\ninformation that is not assumed by speakers to be already shared with addressees \u2026 Pragmatics and psychology 49\n\u2026 addressee location plays a crucial role in the selection of demonstratives, not only\ndue to addressees\u2019 part in affecting the status of shared space \u2026, but also due to their\npart in determining how speakers\u2019 messages are designed.\n(Enfield 2003: 108f.)\nSome deictic systems also have forms that encode the non-attention of the addressee to\nthe referent. \u00d6zy\u00fcrek (1998) and \u00d6zy\u00fcrek and Kita (2001), for example, redefine the\nTurkish demonstrative \u2018su\u2019, traditionally referred to as encoding medial distance in\nopposition to proximal \u2018bu\u2019 and distal \u2018o\u2019, as such a form. In their analyses, it is evident\nthat the referent of \u2018su\u2019 is \u2018something you (the addressee) are not attending to now\u2019.\nThese studies show that \u2018reference is a collaborative process\u2019 (de Le\u00f3n 1990: 3) \u2013 an\naspect that has been neglected in most studies on reference by verbal means in general.\nThe next subsection describes and illustrates the system of spatial deixis in Kilivila.\n2.3.1 Spatial deixis in Kilivila9\nIn what follows the Kilivila system of demonstratives (in their function as demonstrative\npronouns and as demonstratives used attributively) is discussed first, then locatives\nand directionals used in spatial deictic reference are presented and finally the use of\nframes of spatial reference is discussed.\n2.3.1.1 Demonstratives\nKilivila has a kind of \u2018general\u2019, \u2018basic\u2019 or \u2018simple\u2019 system of demonstrative pronouns\n(that also take over the function of local or place adverbs) that are obligatorily\naccompanied by a deictic gesture. The Trobriand Islanders may point at something or\nsomeone with their index finger, with their eyes, with a lifted chin or with puckered\nlips. This basic system is speaker-based and consists of three forms that express\nproximal, medial and distal distinctions.10 In these forms the meanings of \u2018this\u2019 and\n\u2018here\u2019 are conflated:\nBesa or beya is used to point to a referent close to the speaker and can be glossed as\n\u2018this/these\u2019 or \u2018here\u2019.11 Besa is most often used in the question:\n(16) Avaka besa?\nwhat this\nWhat is this?\nHere speakers (for example children learning the language) cannot specify the referent\nmore precisely and thus cannot use the more specific demonstrative pronoun that\nrequires a classifier (see below) for its word formation. An answer to such a question (in\na given context, of course) may run:\n(17) Besa budubadu gwadina.\nthis many nut\nThese are many nuts. 50 Understanding pragmatics\nThe demonstrative beyo is used (together with a deictic gesture) to point to a referent\nthat is further away from the speaker; it can be glossed as \u2018that/those\u2019 or \u2018there\u2019, as\nillustrated in example:\n(18) Beyo Dukuboi budubadu kwau.\nthere Dukuboi many shark\nThere at Dukuboi point are many sharks.\nThe demonstrative beyuuu is produced with a lengthened final vowel; it points\n(together with a deictic gesture) to a referent that is far away from the speaker and\nthat even may be invisible in the actual speech situation (see (20) below); it may be\nglossed as \u2018that/those over there\u2019 or with the archaic expression \u2018yonder\u2019. The following\nexamples (19) and (20) illustrate the use of this form. The distance between Alotau,\nthe capital of Milne Bay Province, and the Trobriand Islands is more than 200 km.\n(19) Kumwedona tommota e-kamkwam-si o baku\nall people 3-eat-PL LOC village ground\nBeya mina Tauwema beyo mina Koma\nthis people.from Tauwema that people.from Koma\nbeyuuu mina Simsim.\nyonder people.from Simsim\nAll the people eat (together) at the village ground. These are the people from\nTauwema, those are the people from Koma, and those over there are the\npeople from Simsim.\n(20) Tetu e-mwa la-paisewa beyuuu Alotau.\nyear 3-come.to 1PAST-work yonder Alotau\nLast year I worked in Alotau over there.\nAll other demonstrative pronouns consist of a fixed morphological frame, formed\nby the word-initial morpheme ma-, or according to phonological rules, also m\u2019 or\nmi-, and the word-final morpheme -na, and an infixed morpheme, which is a\nclassifier.12 To distinguish between singular and plural there is also a plural marking\nmorpheme -si-, which is infixed between the classifier and the word-final morpheme\n-na. Demonstrative pronouns formed in this way express the concept of \u2018this/these\nhere\u2019. To express the deictic concept of \u2018that/those there\u2019, the morpheme -we- is\ninfixed either in singular forms between the classifier and word-final -na or in plural\nforms between the plural-marker -si- and word-final -na. To express the kind of\ndeictic concept that comes close to the English demonstrative \u2018yonder\u2019, the Kilivila\nspeaker takes the forms of the demonstrative pronouns expressing the concept of\n\u2018that/those there\u2019 and changes the final vowel /a/ of the word-final morpheme -na to\nan /e/ that is lengthened and that gets a minor accent. These demonstrative pronouns\nconstitute the second, more complex speaker-based system of demonstratives in\nKilivila. The following examples illustrate the rather complex word formation\nprocesses of these demonstratives: Pragmatics and psychology 51\n(21) m-to-na tau\nDEM-CLF.male-DEM man\nthis man\nm-to-si-na tauwau\nDEM-CLF.male-PL-DEM men\nthese men\n(22) mi-na-we-na vivila\nDEM-CLF.female-MED-DEM girl\nthat girl\nmi-na-si-we-na vivila\nDEM-CLF.female-PL-MED-DEM girl\nthose girls\n(23) ma-ke-we-neee waga\nDEM-CLF.wooden-MED-DEM.DIST. canoe\nthe canoe yonder\nma-ke-si-we-neee waga\nDEM-CLF.wooden-PL-MED-DEM.DIST canoe\nthose canoes yonder\nThus, we have two basic sets of demonstratives, one of which obligatorily requires\ndeictic gestures. The system with its proximal, medial, and distal forms is speaker-\ncentred. A specific characteristic of the second set of demonstratives is that they need\nthe incorporation of classifiers in their word formation. These classifiers play an\nimportant role for the deictic function of these demonstratives. They provide additional\ninformation that contributes to narrow down, and further specify, the search domain\nfor the referent to which these deictic forms point. In what follows I will briefly\nelaborate on this characteristic feature of Kilivila.\nThe Kilivila classifiers can be grouped into 20 semantic domains: Person and\nBody Parts; Animal; Quantity (living beings and things); General classifiers\n(unmarked forms for inanimates); Measure; Time; Place; Quality; Shape; Tree,\nWood, Wooden Things; Utensils; Yam; Part of a Food House, a Canoe, a Creel;\nDoor, Entrance, Window; Fire, Oven; Road, Journey; Text; Ritual Item; Dress,\nAdornment; Name.\nIt is obvious that such a categorization of referents in the real world codified by the\nclassifiers heavily supports the deictic functions of the demonstratives that must\nincorporate these formatives within their word formation. The classifiers are affixed\nin the morphological frame of the demonstratives (as illustrated in the examples (21)\nto (23) above). They provide the addressee with information with respect to the quality\nof the referent the speaker refers to in his or her deictic utterance. These qualities\nencompass many parameters, like height, state, etc.13 The following two examples\nbriefly illustrate this point: 52 Understanding pragmatics\n(24) Ku-lilei ma-pwa-si-na tetu olopola bwalita.\n2-throw.away DEM-CLF.rotten-PL-DEM yams into sea\nThrow these rotten yams into the sea.\nThis deictic reference is unequivocal for addressees \u2013 no matter how big a pile of yams\nthey are confronted with.\n(25) Wei ma-nunu-na bagula va keda\nlook.out DEM-CLF.garden.corner-DEM garden DIR. path\nbi-la Kaduwaga mwata na-veaka e-sisu.\n3-FUT Kaduwaga snake CLF.animal-big 3-be\nLook out, at this corner of the garden at the path to Kaduwaga there is a big\nsnake!\nHere the classifier -nunu- within the demonstratives clearly indicates the area in which\nthe speaker saw a snake. This deictic reference is unequivocal for the addressee.\nAs to the actual usage of the Kilivila demonstratives in \u2018table-top\u2019 space \u2013 that is in\nthe space just before the speaker and hearer, within arm\u2019s reach \u2013 and in the space\nbeyond it we observe the following:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) In general, both sets of demonstratives can be used for spatial deictic reference\nboth in \u2018table-top\u2019 space and in the space beyond it.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The proximal forms of the demonstratives are semantically unmarked, they are\nmost often used and thus have the widest spatial distribution.\nThe following sentences and situations illustrate this feature. Sitting with me in my\nhouse, one of my consultants is warning me of a mosquito, saying:\n(26) Ku-gisi mi-na-na nim i-gade-m beya.\n2-look DEM-CLF.animal-DEM mosquito 3-bite-you here\nLook this mosquito is biting you here.\nA few minutes later he points into the direction of the fresh water grotto (called Bugei),\nten minutes walking distance away in the bush and says:\n(27) Beya Bugei sena budubadu nim.\nhere (proximal + gesture) Bugei very many mosquitoes\nHere at the Bugei (fresh water cave) are many mosquitoes.\n(Note that the appropriate demonstrative for an English speaker for referring\nto this cave in this situation would be \u2018there\u2019).\nAnother consultant is sitting with me in my house in Tauwema and explains to a\nvisitor:\n(28) E-sisu beya Germany.\n3-be here (proximal + gesture) Germany\nHe lives here in Germany. Pragmatics and psychology 53\n(Note that the appropriate demonstrative for an English speaker for referring\nto Germany in this situation would be \u2018(over) there\u2019 or even \u2018yonder\u2019).\nSpeakers may only use the proximal and medial forms to distinguish between referents\nthat are in medial and distal positions. However, if speakers want to refer to something\nthat is really far away or invisible from their present position, and they want to mark\nthis fact, they use the distal forms. If they want to refer to their own body parts\ncontrastively, they may use the proximal and the medial forms (but not the distal\nforms). This is illustrated by the following sentences:\n(29) Waga bi-la beya Bwemwaga igau bi-la beyo Tuma,\ncanoe 3FUT-go here Bwemwaga then 3FUT-go there Tuma\ne ma-ke-na waga bi-la beyuuu Simsimla.\nand DEM-CLF.wooden-DEM canoe 3FUT-go yonder Simsim\nThe canoe will go here to Bwemwaga and then there to Tuma and this canoe\nwill go over there to Simsim.\n(30) Ma-kwaya-na tega-la i-korosim\nDEM-CLF.limb-DEM ear-his 3-itch\nma-kwaya-we-na bwena\nDEM-CLF.limb-MED-DEM good\nThis ear is itching, that (one) is fine.\nIn their deictic references speakers of Kilivila can take the position of other participants\nin the speech situation into account. That is to say, speakers can shift their basic\nreference point, their \u2018origo\u2019 (B\u00fchler 1934: 102 [= 1990: 117]).\nThis is illustrated by the following utterances elicited with a questionnaire developed\nby Pederson and Wilkins (1996).14 Three objects were put on a table in front of a speaker\non the sagittal (away) axis. At the right side of the table, from the speaker\u2019s point of\nview, was the addressee, who was facing the table, and opposite the speaker was\nanother person, facing the table and the speaker \u2013 as illustrated in Figure 2.1:\nFigure 2.1\nSpeaker Object1 Object2 Object3 Other Person\nAddressee\nTo refer to the three objects, speakers produced utterances like the following ones:\nObject 1\n(31a) ma-kwe-na omata-gu\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM in.front.of-me\nthis (one) in front of me 54 Understanding pragmatics\nand:\n(31b) ma-kwe-na o m kivivama\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM LOC your left\nthis (one) at your left\nObject 2\n(31c) ma-kwe-na oluvala\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM in the middle\nthis (one) in the middle\nObject 3\n(31d) ma-kwe-na o m kakata\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM LOC your right\nthis (one) at your right\nand:\n(31e) ma-kwe-na o mata-la\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM LOC eye-his/her\nthis (one) in front of him/her\nIn another situation, three objects were put on a table in front of a speaker on the\ntransverse (across) axis. At the right side of the table, from the speaker\u2019s point of view,\nwas the addressee, who was facing the table, and opposite the speaker was another\nperson, facing the table and the speaker \u2013 as illustrated in Figure 2.2:\nFigure 2.2\nObject 1\nSpeaker Object 2 Other Person\nObject 3\nAddressee\nTo refer to the three objects, speakers produced utterances like the following:\nObject 1\n(32a) ma-kwe-na o gu kikivama\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM LOC my left\nthis (one) at my left\nand: Pragmatics and psychology 55\n(32b) ma-kwe-we-na o la kakata\nDEM-CLF.thing-MED-DEM LOC his right\nthat (one) at his right\nObject 2\n(32c) ma-kwe-na oluvala\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM in the middle\nthis (one) in the middle\nand:\n(32d) ma-kwe-na omata-ma yegu mtona\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM in.front.of-us (DU.EXCL) I him\nthis (one) in front of us, (in front of) me (and) him\nObject 3\n(32e) ma-kwe-na omata-m\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM in.front.of-you\nthis (one) in front of you\nSpeakers use their distance based systems not only on the \u2018away\u2019 \u2013 or sagittal \u2013 axis, but\nalso on the across \u2013 or left/right \u2013 axis.\nIn the vertical dimension, the Kilivila system is organized around the speaker\u2019s\ntorso. The proximal forms are used to refer to referents at a \u2018chest-belly-head\u2019 level, the\nmedial forms refer to referents at the speaker\u2019s feet and above his or her head. The\ndistal forms are rather rarely used here; however, when used, they point to referents\nthat are really deep under or high above a speaker.\n(33a) ma-kwe-na o kuku-gu\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM LOC chest-my\nthis (one) at my chest\n(33b) ma-kwe-na o lopo-gu\nDEM-CLF.thing-DEM LOC belly-my\nthis (one) at my belly\n(33c) ma-kwe-we-na alavigimkoila o kaike-gu\nDEM-CLF.thing-MED-DEM at the end LOC foot-my\nthat (one) at the end at my foot\n(33d) ma-kwe-we-na o kunu-gu alavigimkoila\nDEM-CLF.thing-MED-DEM LOC hair-my at the end\nthat (one) at (above) my hair at the end 56 Understanding pragmatics\nIn space beyond table-top space speakers prefer the use of both sets of demonstratives.\nThe first form used is usually a form belonging to the set of demonstratives that require\na classifier for their word formation. This form expresses the \u2018proximal\u2019, \u2018medial\u2019, or\n\u2018distal\u2019 distinction. The second form then can just be the proximal form of the set of\ndemonstratives that requires accompanying gestures. It seems that this second\ndemonstrative form then has the function to keep the addressee\u2019s attention focused on\nthe spatial area marked by the first form. This form of spatial deictic reference is\nillustrated by the following utterance elicited in a game:\n(34a) Menumla (male consultant):\nWetana, ku-ne\u2019i yata-la kaliekwa e-sagisi\nWetana (name), 2-find CLF.flexible-one cloth 3-hang\nkwe-ta kaukweda.\nCLF.thing-one veranda\nWetana, find a piece of cloth that is hanging at a veranda.\n(34b) Wetana (male consultant):\nBogwa la-bani mi-ya-we-neee beya\nalready 1PAST-find DEM-CLF.flexible-MED-DEM.DIST here\nTopiesi o kaukweda ya-bweyani.\nTopiesi (name) LOC veranda CLF.flexible-red\nI already found it, the (one) yonder, here at Topiesi\u2019s veranda, the red (one).\n2.3.1.2 Non-spatial uses of the Kilivila demonstratives\nKilivila demonstrative pronouns that are formed with classifiers are used in discourse\ndeixis for anaphoric reference. With the classifiers incorporated in their word\nformation, the demonstratives perform the important function of securing coherence\nin discourse because they also secure semantic concord beyond sentence boundaries.\nThis is illustrated with the following examples:\n(35) A-tatai tataba. Tauwau tabalu\n1-carve tataba-board men Tabalu-subclan\nm-to-si-na ma-ke-na si koni.\nDEM-CLF.male-PL-DEM DEM-CLF.wooden-DEM their sign.of.honour\nI carve a tataba-board. These men belong to the Tabalu-subclan \u2013 this is\ntheir sign of honour.\nWith this sentence the speaker refers to a certain board with carved patterns that\nmarks houses, food houses, and canoes as the personal property of men belonging to\nthe Tabalu-subclan. Despite the fact that in the second sentence the nouns to which the\ndemonstratives refer are omitted, the anaphoric reference of the two demonstrative\npronouns produced is unequivocal, because in this context the classifier -to- can only\nrefer to the noun tauwau (men) and the classifier -ke- can only refer to the noun tataba\n(tataba-board); the classifiers represent the omitted nouns in a quasi-fragmentary way.\nAs a general rule, once a noun has been introduced, as long as it is not reclassified, e.g. Pragmatics and psychology 57\nfor stylistic reasons, the following references to this nominal denotatum may consist of\nthe demonstrative pronouns only, that is, the noun itself is then no longer realized; it is\nomitted in the noun phrases. However, if the noun is reclassified, then it must be\nrealized again as a constituent of the noun phrase to secure unequivocal and\nunambiguous reference, see example (36).\n(36) O da-valu-si e-sisu-si tommota to-paisewa.\nLOC 1.INCL-village-PL 3-live-PL people CLF.human-work\nVivila na-salau, tauwau to-bugubagula.\nwoman CLF.female-busy men CLF.male-work in the garden\nTommota gala to-dubakasala, kena kumwedona\npeople not CLF.human-rude but all\ne-nukwali-si bubune-si bwena.\n3-know-PL manners-their good\nIn our village live people taking pleasure in their work. The women are busy,\nthe men are good gardeners. The people are not rude, but all have good\nmanners.\nThis example illustrates that, in general, reclassification of a noun does not allow its\nomission. To emphasize the different characterization of men and women on the one\nhand and all villagers on the other hand, the nouns cannot be omitted. The speaker\nuses the classifier -to- to refer to human beings and to persons of male sex. The classifier\n-na- is used to refer to persons of female sex. If the speaker did not use the noun\ntommota in the last sentence again, then this sentence would refer to persons of male\nsex only. Cataphoric reference in Kilivila has not been documented so far.\n2.3.1.3 Locatives and directionals\nKilivila grammaticalizes body part terms into locatives that are used for spatial deictic\nreference (see Senft 1998). Thus we find expressions like the following ones:\no-daba-la on, on top (of)\n(LOC-daba-3.PP.IV15 \u2013 head, forehead, brain)\no-kopo\u2019u-la behind, back, behind him/her\n(LOC-kopo\u2019u-3.PP.IV \u2013 back)\no-lopo-la in, inside (of), in the middle (of)\n(LOC-lopo-3.PP.IV \u2013 belly, windpipe, innards)\no-mata-la in front (of), before, before him/her\n(LOC-mata-3.PP.IV \u2013 eye)\no-vado-la on, on top (of), on the surface (of), at\n(LOC-vado-3.PP:IV \u2013 mouth) the mouth/opening (of) 58 Understanding pragmatics\nWe also find the following grammaticalized forms to express the concepts \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019:\no-kakata on the left hand side, on the left\n(LOC-kakata \u2013 left, left hand side)\no-kikivama on the right hand side, on the right\n(LOC-kikivama \u2013 right, right hand side)\nBody part terms like \u2018mata-PP.IV\u2019 can also be used metaphorically, as illustrated in the\nfollowing question:\n(37) Mata-la ma-ke-na kai ambeya,\neye-his/her DEM-CLF.wood/rigid-DEM stick where\ne-mwa yokwa?\n3-come.to you?\nThe tip of this stick where (is it), does it come to you?\nIn this sentence somebody asks for information about a certain direction. To indicate\ndirections and/or locations, Trobriand Islanders have to decide whether they want to\nspecify the goal or location with a personal or place name, or whether they want to\nspecify the goal or location as a specific place, but without a place name or proper\nname, or whether they want to refer to the goal or location (or to the general direction\nwhere this goal or location is) with a general term.\nIf they want to refer to the goal or location with a place or a proper name, they do not\nuse any locative whatsoever:\n(38) Ba-la Kaduwaga.\n1.FUT-go Kaduwaga (name of a village)\nI will go to Kaduwaga.\nIf they want to refer to the goal or location with a more specific term or if they want to\nrefer to a specified place at the destination of a motion event, they use the locative o; the\nlocative incorporates a feature of definiteness for the governed noun phrase.\n(39) Ba-la o buyagu.\n1.FUT-go to garden\nI will go to the garden (i.e. my personal, specific garden plot).\nIf they want to refer to the goal or location with its most general term, if they want to\nrefer to the general direction in which this goal or location is, and/or if they want to\nrefer to an unspecified place at the destination of a motion event, they use the\ndirectional va:\n(40) Ba-la va bagula.\n1.FUT-go to garden\nI will go to the garden (general, unspecified expression for \u2018garden\u2019). Pragmatics and psychology 59\nThe Kilivila system of demonstratives, locatives and directionals allows its speakers\nto clearly distinguish, and point to, referents in specific spatial relations, at certain\nlocations and in specific directions as idiomatically and unequivocally as possible.\nMoreover, to do this, positional and sometimes also motion verbs are used together\nwith the respective demonstratives, locatives and directionals. The following examples\nillustrate such forms of spatial references. A question like:\n(41) Ambe peni?\nwhere pencil\nWhere\u2019s the pencil?\ncan be answered simply with the exophoric demonstrative in (42a) or in a more\ncomplex construction illustrated in (42b).\n(42a) Beya!\nHere! (+ accompanying gesture to the place where the pencil is).\n(42b) Ma-ke-na peni odabala tebeli e-kanukwenu\nDEM-CLF.wooden.thing-DEM pencil on.top.(of) table 3-rest\nmata-la e-mikeya-gu.\neye-its 3-come.towards-me\nThis pencil is lying on top of the table, its tip is pointing towards me.\nMoreover, in spatial deictic reference local landmarks and other environmental\nfeatures are quite often mentioned to make it easier for the addressee to find and\nidentify the object the speaker is pointing at (see sentences [43a and b])16:\n(43a) Ku-gisi ma-ke-we-na mwasawa b-ima\n2-see DEM-CLF.wooden-MED.-DEM big.canoe 3.FUT-come\nbeya va numia.\nhere DIR stony.reef\nLook at that big canoe sailing towards us there in the direction of the stony\nreef.\n(43b) Mi-na-we-si-na taninua galayomala va\nDEM-CLF.animal-MED-PL-DEM sardines many DIR\ndom e m-to-si-na bi-lo-si bi-pola-si.\nmuddy.reef and DEM-CLF.man-PL-DEM 3.FUT-go-PL 3.FUT-fish-PL\nThose many sardines in the direction of the muddy reef \u2013 and these men\nwill go and fish them.\n2.3.1.4 Frames of spatial reference\nLike many other languages, Kilivila allows its speakers to use all three frames of\nreference presented in subsection 2.3 above. However, as pointed out in Senft\n(2001: 550) the Trobriand Islanders clearly prefer the intrinsic frame of reference 60 Understanding pragmatics\nfor the location of objects with respect to each other in a given spatial configuration\n\u2013 especially if these objects themselves have intrinsic features. An absolute ad hoc\nlandmark frame of reference system (see below) is preferred in referring to the\nspatial orientation of objects in a given spatial orientation. This is illustrated by the\nfollowing two descriptions of photographs designed by the Cognitive Anthropology\nResearch Group at the MPI for Psycholinguistics for focused elicitation of verbal\nreferences to space in interactional games in the framework of a comparative\ncross-linguistic and cross-cultural research project on spatial reference (see also\nsubsection 4.3 below):\n(44) Ma-na-na bulumakau o pilakeva e-tota mata-la\nDEM-CLF.animal-DEM cow LOC topside 3-stand eye-its\nThis cow is standing at the topside, its eye\ne-la o valu poa-la e-seki Tuyabwau e\n3-go LOC village back-its 3-be Tuyabwau.well and\ngoes towards the village, its back is towards the Tuyabwau well, and\nke-ta kai ma-na-na bulumakau o\nCLF.wood-one tree DEM-CLF.animal-DEM cow LOC\nkopo\u2019u-la\nbehind-it\na tree, this cow behind it \u2013\ne-tota, o tubolo-la bogwa oku-nukwali.

S.].\nSpeaker 2:\nE ma-na-na osa ambe e-sisu?\nand DEM-CLF.animal-DEM horse where 3-be\nAnd this horse, where is it?\nSpeaker 1:\nOluvale-la kali.\ninside-its fence\nInside of its fence. 62 Understanding pragmatics\nSpeaker 2:\nMata-la ambe bi-mwa?\neye-its where 3.FUT-come.to\nAnd its eye, where will it come to?\nSpeaker 1:\nBi-la o valu.\n3.FUT-go LOC village.\nIt will go to the village.\nThe speakers who describe the photographs rely on the intrinsic frame of reference\nin order to locate objects in relation to each other. This is illustrated in description\n(44) above. As pointed out in Senft (2001: 544f.), the expressions o kopo\u2019ula (behind\nit), o tubolola (at its back), o matasi (in front of their eyes) clearly mark the intrinsic\nframe of reference the speaker uses for describing the location of the objects in\nrelation to each other. In both descriptions we also immediately notice the use of ad\nhoc landmarks like laodila (bush), kwadeva (beach), bwalita (sea), valu (village),\nTuyabwau (name of a fresh water well), pilakeva (topside, landside \u2013 versus pilitinava\n= lowland, seaside, beachside) \u2013 generally in connection with the locative o; thus\nKilivila speakers switch to an absolute frame of reference that uses ad hoc landmarks\nto describe the orientation of the objects depicted in the photographs. Among these\nad hoc landmarks we not only find names of wells, beaches, reefs, rocks, or trees, but\nalso \u2013 depending on the context and situation, of course \u2013 references to houses and\ntheir respective owners and even to people that are sitting in the respective direction.\nThese axes of orientation are indeed created on the spot, very much in an ad hoc\nmanner, and they may refer to landmarks both within a big and a small scale\nenvironment, like the general environment or marks on the set of the interactional\ngames used for data elicitation. All these axes are used as frequently as the bush\u2013sea\nor bush\u2013shore axis and therefore no special status is assigned to the latter axis \u2013\nalthough this land\u2013sea axis features rather prominently in many other (and not only\nAustronesian) languages (see Bennardo 2002; Senft 1997a). The examples in (44)\nand (45) illustrate that Kilivila speakers prefer the use of the intrinsic frame of\nreference for the location of objects in relation to each other and the use of an ad hoc\nlandmark absolute frame of reference for describing the orientation of these objects.\nThe relative-deictic frame of spatial reference is rather rarely used.17\n2.4 GESTURE\nWhen produced in face-to-face interaction, indexicals are usually accompanied by a\npointing gesture. This section deals with gestures in general and with its various\nforms, including deictic gestures. After a brief introduction to Wilhelm Wundt\u2019s\ngroundbreaking ideas on what he called \u2018the language of gestures\u2019, this section\nprovides a survey on gesture research and discusses the relevance of these studies for\npragmatics. Pragmatics and psychology 63\n2.4.1 Introduction\nAt the very beginning of this chapter it was pointed out that the term \u2018deixis\u2019 is\nborrowed from the Greek word for \u2018pointing\u2019 or \u2018indicating\u2019. Sentences like the\nfollowing one:\n(46) This bush-knife is sharp, but this one is blunt.\nneed an accompanying deictic or \u2018demonstrative\u2019 gesture in order to be understood.\nIn his pioneering contribution The language of gestures Wilhelm Wundt (1973;\n1900, first part, Chapter Two) classified such a \u2018demonstrative gesture\u2019 as \u2018not only the\nsimplest but also the most primary gesture in the effort to communicate\u2019 (Wundt 1973:\n74). Wundt also pointed out that there are a number of other gesture types besides\nthese demonstrative gestures. In his psychological classification of gestures he\ndifferentiated between imitative gestures, connotative gestures, and symbolic gestures\nand emphasized that there is a syntax of gestural communication. Wundt\u2019s classification\nand his theory about gesture will not be discussed in more detail here. But it should be\nemphasized that his classification of different forms and functions of gestures and his\ninsight that:\n[n]atural gestural communication, which under similar conditions, develops\nspontaneously time and again in the same manner, bears its own proof that it is\nindependent from outside coercion and arbitrary invention in its psychological\nregularity ... [and that] ... this regularity in no way excludes individual influences and\nartificial inventions which serve to perfect gestural communications in the interest of\nachieving special purposes.\n(Wundt 1973: 145f.)\nlaid the foundations and set standards for the study of gestures (and sign languages).18\nAmong the most influential scholars who took up Wundt\u2019s ideas in developing their\nown theories of gesture are the psychologists Adam Kendon, David McNeill and Susan\nGoldin-Meadow. Based on the insights of these scholars and of other experts in the\nfield, the next subsection provides a definition of gesture, presents and briefly illustrates\nthe classification of gestures into different types and discusses their functions and the\ninterrelationship with language and mind. Based on Kita (2009), subsection 2.4.3\ndiscusses the pragmatics of gestures and provides a survey of the cross-cultural\nvariation of gestures. And subsection 2.4.4 discusses so-called pragmatic gestures\nwhich function as illocutionary and discourse structure markers.\n2.4.2 Gesture, language and mind\nIt is common knowledge that we all produce gestures while we are speaking, that we\nsometimes produce them instead of speaking and that we sometimes produce them\neven without the presence of an addressee as, for example, in telephone conversations.\nAnd we also know that so far no culture has been found in which gestures are not\nused as a means of communication. But what are gestures? Gestures were classified 64 Understanding pragmatics\nfor a long time as a means of non-verbal communication (see, e.g. Weitz 1979).\nHowever, as early as 1972 Kendon analysed the coordination of speech and body\nmotion in a single speaker and showed that gestures \u2018are integral parts of the\nprocesses of language and its use\u2019 (McNeill 2005: 13). Kendon (1980) continued to\nchallenge the view that gestures are forms of non-verbal communication and a few\nyears later McNeill (1985: 1) \u2018based on the very close temporal, semantic, pragmatic,\npathological and developmental parallels between speech and referential and\ndiscourse oriented gestures\u2019 argued that \u2018gestures and speech are parts of the same\npsychological structure\u2019. McNeill\u2019s argument put forward in this paper is succinctly\nsummarized by Goldin-Meadow (2006: 337) who points out that \u2018to ignore the\ninformation conveyed in ... these gestures is to ignore parts of the conversation\u2019.\nMcNeill (1992: 1) defined gestures rather straightforwardly as \u2018movements of the\nhands and arms that we see when people talk\u2019; however, this definition is rather\nnarrow. In the first issue of the journal Gesture its editors Adam Kendon and\nCornelia M\u00fcller outlined the scope of the new periodical as follows:\nGESTURE is a new journal for the emerging field of \u2018gesture studies\u2019. The phenomena\nthat this encompasses cannot easily be defined (\u2018gesture\u2019 is a concept with fuzzy\nboundaries), but they include the wide variety of ways in which humans give what is\nusually regarded as wilful expression to their thoughts and feelings through visible\nbodily action. Thus, the movement of the body, especially the hands and arms, that are\nso often integrated with spoken expression, the use of manual actions to convey\nsomething without speech, or the manual and facial actions of sign languages, are all\nrecognized as a part of \u2018gesture\u2019, broadly conceived, whereas expressions such as\nlaughing and crying, blushing and the like are less likely to be so considered unless\nthey are feigned or enacted.\n(Kendon and M\u00fcller 2001: 1)\nDespite the caveat that the phenomena which are subsumed under the label \u2018gesture\u2019\nare difficult to define, this outline of the scope of the journal implicitly provides an\napproach to such a definition. In his 2004 monograph Kendon first offers the following\ndefinition of gesture:\n\u2018Gesture\u2019 ... is the name for visible action when it is used as an utterance or as a part of\nan utterance ... [A]n \u2018utterance\u2019 is any unit of activity that is treated by those co-present\nas a communicative \u2018move\u2019, \u2018turn\u2019 or \u2018contribution\u2019. Such units of activity may be\nconstructed from speech or from visible bodily action or from the combination of\nthese two modalities ... \u2018Gesture\u2019 is the visible bodily action that has a role in such units\nof action.\n(Kendon 2004: 7)\nAnd then he elaborates on this first definition as follows:\n\u2018Gesture\u2019 ... is a label for actions that have the feature of manifest deliberate\nexpressiveness. They are those actions or those aspects of another\u2019s action that, having Pragmatics and psychology 65\nthese features, tend to be directly perceived as being under the guidance of the observed\nperson\u2019s voluntary control and being done for the purpose of expression rather than in\nthe service of some practical aim. Participants in interaction readily recognize such\nactions and they tend to be accorded the status of actions for which the participants are\nheld responsible.\n(Kendon 2004: 15)\nThere are many different forms of actions that can be subsumed under this definition.\nOn the basis and in honour of Kendon\u2019s earlier work McNeill (1992: 37) proposed to\norder gestures of different kinds along \u2018Kendon\u2019s continuum\u2019 in the following way:\nGesticulation \u2192 Language-like Gestures \u2192 Pantomimes \u2192 Emblems \u2192 Sign Languages\nAs we move from left to right: (1) the obligatory presence of speech declines, (2) the\npresence of language properties increases, and (3) idiosyncratic gestures are replaced\nby socially regulated signs.\n(McNeill 1992: 37)\n\u2018Gesticulations\u2019 or \u2018speech framed gestures\u2019 or (as McNeill prefers to say) \u2018gestures\u2019\naccompany speech spontaneously. McNeill (2006: 60) differentiates them into four\nsubtypes:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Depictive or representative iconic gestures (i.e. Wundt\u2019s symbolic gestures) \u2018present\nimages of concrete entities and/or actions. For example, appearing to grasp and\nbend back something while saying \u201cand he bends it way back\u201d\u2019.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Metaphoric gestures \u2018picture abstract content, in effect imagining the non-\nimaginable ... [A]n abstract meaning is presented as if it had form and/or occupied\nspace. For example, a speaker appears to be holding an object, as if presenting it,\nyet the meaning is not presenting a concrete object but an idea or memory of some\nother abstract \u201cobject\u201d\u2019.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Deictic gestures point to referents of speech (as already mentioned above).\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Beats are gestures in which \u2018the hand appears to be beating time ... [they] are mere\nflicks of the hand(s) up and down or back and forth, zeroing in rhythmically on the\nprosodic peaks of speech\u2019.\nWith these gestures Kendon, McNeill and McNeill\u2019s former student Sotaro Kita\ndifferentiate five gesture phases, the preparation phase, the stroke and the retraction\nphase as well as a pre- and a post-stroke hold phase. The stroke phase is obligatory\nbecause this is the gesture phase with meaning. All other phases are organized around\nthe stroke phase (see, e.g. McNeill 2006: 62).\nLanguage-like gestures are also called \u2018emblems\u2019 or \u2018quotable gestures\u2019. McNeill\n(2006: 59) defines them as \u2018conventionalized signs, such as thumbs up\u2019 which are\n\u2018culturally specific, have standard forms and significance and ... are meaningful\nwithout speech although they also occur with speech\u2019. 66 Understanding pragmatics\nPantomime is defined by McNeill (2006: 59) as \u2018a gesture or a sequence of gestures\nconveying a story to tell, produced without speech\u2019.\nSign languages consist of signs that are lexical words. They are linguistic systems in\ntheir own rights with own properties.19\nKendon as well as McNeill claim that gestures are part of language. In the\nintroduction to his anthology Language and Gesture McNeill (2000: 9) states that in\nthis volume \u2018gestures are regarded as parts of language itself \u2013 not as embellishments\nor elaborations, but as integral parts of the processes of language and its use\u2019. Moreover,\nMcNeill (2000: 139) also points out that he and many other colleagues of his understand\n\u2018speech-synchronized gestures as windows into the on-line processes of thinking and\nspeaking\u2019. In his contribution to the very same anthology, Kendon answers the question\n\u2018Language and gesture: unity or duality?\u2019 on the basis of empirical data as follows:\ngestures are organized in relation to the spoken phrases they accompany in such a way\nthat we must say that they are part of the very construction of the utterance itself.\nGesture and speech ... are composed together as components of a single overall plan.\nWe have to say that although each expresses somewhat different dimensions of\nmeaning, speech and gesture are co-expressive of a single inclusive ideational complex,\nand it is this that is the meaning of the utterance ...\nIf ... we think of \u2018language\u2019 as a complex of instrumentalities which serve in the\nexpression of \u2018thought\u2019 ... then gesture is part of \u2018language\u2019.\n(Kendon 2000: 61f.)\nThese statements clearly mark the quite extreme position of these two pioneers of\ngesture research with respect to the relationship between gesture, language and mind.\nBased on the research of Goldin-Meadow and especially on her 2006 handbook article\non the \u2018hands role in talking and thinking\u2019 this relationship with the emphasis on\nmind will now be discussed in some more detail.\nGoldin-Meadow is a specialist in children\u2019s use of gesture. Like developmental\nstudies in psycholinguistics, developmental studies on gesture provide insights into\nchildren\u2019s knowledge and reveal information about their ways of thinking. Goldin-\nMeadow points out that children start to gesture \u2013 without words \u2013 at between 8 and\n12 months, producing deictic gestures, especially pointing and hold-up gestures as\nwell as conventional gestures like nods and headshakes (to express yes or no) in their\nculture-specific way. Even children who are born blind or even deaf and blind also\nstart to gesture if and when they acquire language (Goldin-Meadow 2006: 345; Eibl-\nEibesfeldt 1973a: 181ff.). Human ethologists take this observation as an indication that\ngesturing is inborn and can be considered to be a so-called \u2018fixed action pattern\u2019 (Eibl-\nEibesfeldt 1973a: 192; see also subsection 3.2.1). Goldin-Meadow (2006: 353) interprets\nthis finding as an indication of the fact that \u2018gesture seems to be an inevitable part of\nspeaking\u2019.\nAt the age of about a year (non-handicapped) children start to produce iconic\ngestures. Metaphoric gestures and beats (i.e. rhythmic beating with a finger, hand or\narm), however, are produced much later. With respect to pointing gestures Goldin-\nMeadow argues that they \u2018constitute an important early step in symbolic development Pragmatics and psychology 67\nand pave the way for learning spoken language\u2019 (see Goldin-Meadow 2006: 338; also\nIverson and Goldin-Meadow 2005). Iconic gestures represent aspects of the referent;\ntherefore they are less context-dependent than pointing gestures, they take on\nlinguistic properties and can function like words. As soon as children learn to\nproduce the word for which they used the gesture, they prefer to produce the word,\nand when they start to combine words they use fewer gestures and rely more on the\nverbal expressions. However, before they combine words with words they start to\ncombine words with gestures. Goldin-Meadow (2006: 339) points out that gestures\nbecome coordinated and integrated with speech20 during the one-word period of the\nlanguage acquisition process in such a way that \u2018gesture and speech begin to have a\ncoherent semantic relationship ... [as well as] ... a synchronous temporal relationship\u2019.\nWith this integration the foundation is laid for the production of simple sentences.\nJust before the two word stage children use the combination of gesture and word for\nconveying different complementary information. Goldin-Meadow (2006: 341ff.)\nrefers to this phenomenon as \u2018gesture-speech mismatch\u2019 which she and her co-\nworkers (see, e.g. Church and Goldin-Meadow 1986) interpret as an index of\nknowledge transition to a stage where two ideas are activated at one and the same\ntime. Goldin-Meadow emphasizes that the \u2018fact that gesture-speech mismatch is a\nreliable index of a child\u2019s transitional status suggests that the two modalities are, in\nfact, not independent of one another\u2019. These gesture-speech mismatches are found\nalso in older children and in adults; they are an important means for conveying\ncomplex information in social interaction. However, at this age, children can\nunderstand gestures produced by others and appropriately respond to them. For\nchildren in the one-word stage of their language acquisition process it is easier to\nunderstand gesture-word combinations than word-word combinations. That three-\nyear-old children can make pragmatic inferences to respond to an adult\u2019s indirect\nspeech act \u2018more likely when they are presented with gesture and speech than with\neither part alone\u2019 (Goldin-Meadow 2006: 343) is illustrated by an experiment\nreported by Spencer Kelly (2001): In this experiment a child was brought to a room\nand the door was left open. In a speech only condition the adult in the room said: \u2018It\nis going to get cold in here\u2019 (see 1.3.5 above). In a gesture only condition the adult just\npointed to the door. And in the gesture and speech condition the adult produced the\nsentence and pointed to the door. Only four-year-olds were able to make the\nappropriate pragmatic inference from either speech or gesture alone (see Goldin-\nMeadow 2006: 343ff.). Thus, children get meaning from speech accompanying\ngestures. It was also found that children \u2018are significantly more likely to learn a novel\nword if it is presented with gesture than without it\u2019.\nChurch and Goldin-Meadow (1986) carried out specific gesture-speech mismatch\nexperiments in which children and adults performed Piagetian conservation tasks. In\nthese experiments the participants were \u2018asked whether the amount of water changed\nwhen it was poured from a tall, skinny container into a short wide container\u2019 (Goldin-\nMeadow 2006: 340f.). And Garber, Alibali and Goldin-Meadow (1998) confronted\nchildren with mathematical equivalence problems. The experiments of these scholars\nshow that \u2018gesture can reflect thoughts that are different from the thoughts a child\nconveys in speech\u2019 (Goldin-Meadow 2006: 350ff.). 68 Understanding pragmatics\nExperiments like these reveal that we not only produce co-speech gestures but also\nco-thought gestures. Co-speech gestures are designed for addressees, be they present\nor not (as in the case of telephone conversations) and speakers use them (in most cases\nunconsciously) to communicate. Asli \u00d6zy\u00fcrek (2002: 1) confirms this insight with two\nexperiments that show that:\nspeakers change their gestures depending on the location of shared space, that is the\nintersection of the gesture spaces of the speakers and addressees. Gesture orientations\nchange more frequently when they accompany spatial prepositions such as into and\nout, which describe motion that has a beginning and end point rather than across,\nwhich depicts an unbound path across space. Speakers change their gestures so that\nthey represent the beginning and end point of motion INTO and OUT by moving into\nand out of the shared space. Thus speakers design their gestures for their addressees\nand therefore use them to communicate.\n(\u00d6zy\u00fcrek 2002: 1; see also 2000)\nSpeakers use their co-speech gestures primarily for their addressees. Thus co-speech\ngestures have a strong social component.\nCo-thought gestures are \u2018hand movements produced in silent, noncommunicative,\nproblem-solving situations\u2019 (Chu and Kita 2011: 1) by the speaker just for him- or\nherself. They are rather \u2018solipsistic\u2019. Chu and Kita \u2013 on the basis of three experiments\n\u2013 found the following:\n[W]hen people have difficulty in solving spatial visual problems [in mental rotation\ntasks or paper folding tasks, G. S.], they spontaneously produce gesture to help them\nand gestures can indeed improve performance. As they solve more problems, the\nspatial computation supported by gestures becomes internalized and the gesture\nfrequency decreases. The benefit of gestures persists even in subsequent spatial\nvisualization problems in which gesture is prohibited. Moreover, the beneficial effect\nof gesturing can be generalized to a different visualization task when two tasks require\nsimilar spatial transformation processes.\n(Chu and Kita 2011: 1)\nThese research results seem to confirm the conclusion Goldin-Meadow (2006: 365)\ndrew on the basis of similar problem-solving experiments; she points out that \u2018gesture\ndoes more than just reflect thought\u2019 \u2013 these results show that gesturing also supports\nthinking (of gesturers)!\nThis subsection of Chapter Two has shown that language, gesture and mind are\nstrongly interrelated. Studies on actual language use have largely ignored this insight\nfor a long time. However, future research on forms of actual language use in linguistic\npragmatics can hardly neglect the multimodal quality of human face-to-face\ninteraction any more. The next subsection will discuss cross-cultural variation of co-\nspeech gestures and the pragmatics of their use. Pragmatics and psychology 69\n2.4.3 Cross-cultural variation of co-speech gestures: The pragmatics of gesture use\nAs mentioned above, it seems that the occurrence of co-speech gestures is universal,\nhowever, the ways gestures are produced vary across cultures. In a paper on this topic\nKita (2009) reviews the literature on cross-cultural variation of gestures and identifies\nfour factors that govern it:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) culture specific conventions for form-meaning associations;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) culture specific spatial cognition;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) linguistic differences; and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) culture-specific gestural pragmatics.\n(Kita 2009: 145).\nTo illustrate the variation of gestures that is due to conventions of form-meaning\nassociation Kita (2009: 146ff.) uses emblems (or \u2018quotable\u2019 gestures in Kendon\u2019s\ndiction) and pointing gestures. The gesture that is made by forming a ring with the\nthumb and the index finger is certainly a very well-known emblem and means in\nmost European cultures \u2018OK/good\u2019. However, the dominant meaning of this gesture\nin France is \u2018zero\u2019 and it is used as an insulting gesture referring to the anus in Greece\nand Turkey (see also Morris et al. 1979). The geographic distribution of emblems can\nbe explained by culture contact \u2013 the impact of which can be rather long lasting. Kita\npoints out that \u2018in Italy the head gesture for negation is a horizontal head shake in\nthe northern part and in Rome, but it is a head toss (i.e. a head jerk up- and backwards)\nin southern Italy, including Naples and Sicily\u2019. The only other places in Europe where\nthis head toss is used as a gesture for negation are Greece and adjacent areas in\nTurkey and Bulgaria. About 750 BC the Greeks colonized the south of Italy \u2013\nDesmond Morris and his colleagues (1979) argue quite plausibly that the head toss\nspread through the southern parts of Italy because of this early contact with the\nancient Greeks.\nAs already mentioned in subsection 2.3, pointing gestures are important indexicals.\nPeople may point to something or someone with their index finger, with their eyes,\nwith puckered lips, etc. Pointing gestures vary from culture to culture. Dixon, for\nexample, notes\nthat some languages have different deictic gestures for relating to varying distances\nand visibility. In the Tucano and Arawak languages of the Vaupes River basin (spanning\nthe border between Brazil and Colombia), for instance, we find (i) pointing with the\nlips for \u201cvisible and near\u201d; (ii) pointing with the lips plus a backwards tilt of the head for\n\u201cvisible and not near\u201d; (iii) pointing with the index finger for \u201cnot visible\u201d (if the\ndirection in which the object lies is known).\n(Dixon 2003: 87)\nAustralian Aboriginals speaking Arrernte distinguish six types of pointing gestures\nthat have contrastive functions: 70 Understanding pragmatics\nindex finger pointing, open hand pointing with the palm down, open hand pointing\nwith the palm vertical, \u2018horn-hand\u2019 pointing (with the thumb, the index finger and the\npinkie extended), lip pointing (pointing by protruding lips), and eye-pointing. Open\nhand pointing with the palm vertical, for example, is used to indicate each straight\nsegment of a complex route. Horn-hand pointing indicates the direction of the end\npoint of a route.\n(Wilkins: 2003; Kita 2009: 148)\nEnfield discusses lip-pointing by Lao speakers. He observes that these speakers restrict\nlip-pointing to \u2018cases in which the location or identity of the referent is in focus in the\nutterance \u2013 these gestures almost exclusively appear as answers to \u201cWhere?\u201d or \u201cWhich\none?\u201d questions\u2019 (Enfield 2001: 207). Moreover, he also points out that speakers only\nseem to produce this kind of pointing when they assume that their interlocutor(s)\nknow the respective referent(s) of this gesture. In addition, this lip-pointing \u2018is always\naccompanied by gaze directed towards the referent\u2019 \u2013 these observations suggest for\nEnfield \u2018that the deictic vector is not provided by the action of the lips, but by the gaze\u2019.\nPointing with the index finger, however, seems to be the default way of the Lao deictic\ngesture; it is used by Lao speakers in a much broader context.\nKita (2009: 149ff.) illustrates the second type of variation of co-speech gestures that is\ndue to cognitive diversity across cultures referring among other studies to John Haviland\u2019s\nresearch on pointing gestures made by speakers of the Australian Aboriginal language\nGuugu Yimidhirr. Haviland showed that this language, besides a rather simple system of\nfour deictics indicating \u2018here, there, yonder\u2019 and \u2018there, that\u2019s the way\u2019, has a spatial\nsystem which is \u2018absolute\u2019 (see 2.3 above), using a \u2018four term system of roots\u2019 the meanings\nof which \u2018correspond roughly to the English compass points\u2019 (Haviland 1979: 72ff.).\nThese speakers are always absolutely oriented \u2013 and this holds for their gestures as well.\nThe absolute encoding of spatial information is reflected in co-speech gestures. Thus, if\nthese speakers point to a place that is about 80 kilometres away from where they are \u2013 and\nthis may be in the middle of the Australian bush \u2013 their pointing gestures only have an\nangular deviation of +/\u2013 14\u00b0 (Levinson et al. 1997: 324; see also Levinson 2003:124ff.). In\n1980 Haviland documented one of his consultants telling a story in which his boat\ncapsized and he had to swim more than five kilometres to the shore. In 1982 Levinson\nfilmed the same man again while he was telling the same story. Kita summarizes\nHaviland\u2019s discussion of these two video documents as follows:\nIn one telling, [the consultant] was facing west, and in the other, he was facing north.\nIt was found that the gestures consistently depicted motion and location in terms of the\nabsolute frame of reference. For example, the movement from west to east was\ngesturally depicted as a movement away from the body when facing east, but as a\nmovement from left to right when facing north. Such absolutely anchored gestures\nwere found in both utterances with and without cardinal direction words. Thus, the\nuse of absolute frame of reference in gesture was not simply due to semantic\ncoordination with the concurrent utterance, but it reflects the nature of underlying\nrepresentations of space.\n(Kita 2009: 151ff.) Pragmatics and psychology 71\nKita further points out that spatial metaphors for the concept of time differ across\ncultures and that these differences are also reflected in gestures. Speakers of English\n(and of many other languages as well) use the front-back axis for pointing to the future\nand the past. However, there are also many other languages in which front implies past\nand back future. The speakers of Aymara, e.g. a language which is spoken in the Andes,\nbase their understanding of past and future \u2018on a conceptual scheme that what is\nknown (e.g. past) is in front and what is unknown (e.g. future) is behind, which in turn\nis based on the fact that vision is an important source of information\u2019. Accordingly,\nspeakers of this language point to the front when they talk about events in the past and\nto the back when they talk about the future (see N\u00fa\u00f1es and Sweetser 2006). These two\nexamples illustrate that variation in gestures is due to cognitive diversity across\ncultures.\nVariation in co-speech gesture which is due to linguistic diversity is illustrated by\nKita (2009: 154ff.) with the results of a study he did in cooperation with Asli \u00d6zy\u00fcrek\nin 2003. Speakers of Japanese, Turkish and English were shown a cartoon movie and\nasked to describe the scene to a listener who did not see the film clip. The clip featured\nan event in which one of the protagonists swung on a rope from a window in one\nskyscraper to the window of another skyscraper across the street. To refer to such a\nchange of location with an arc trajectory, speakers of English can produce the verb \u2018to\nswing\u2019; Japanese and Turkish speakers, however, do not have any equivalent verb or\nany other easy and straightforward paraphrase that encodes this concept. On the basis\nof this insight Kita summarizes the results of this study as follows:\nConsequently, Japanese and Turkish speakers\u2019 description of the event did not encode\nthe arc trajectory but instead used more generic verbs of motion such as to go or to jump,\nwhile all English speakers used the verb swing. The gestural representation of the event\nshowed a parallel cross-linguistic difference. Japanese and Turkish speakers were more\nlikely to produce \u2018straight gestures\u2019, which did not show the arc trajectory than English\nspeakers. English speakers mostly used \u2018arc gestures\u2019 that depicted both the change of\nlocation and the arc trajectory. In other words, when the speech does not encode a\nparticular aspect of an event, the accompanying gesture tended not to depict it either.\n(Kita 2009: 154f.)\nThe fact that languages like English encode manner and path of motion in one clause\n(e.g. it rolled down the slope) but languages like Turkish and Japanese do this in two\nclauses (e.g. it descended as it rolled) also influences the production of co-speech\ngestures. In a number of studies Kita, \u00d6zy\u00fcrek and their colleagues (see e.g. \u00d6zy\u00fcrek\nand Kita 1999; \u00d6zy\u00fcrek et al. 2008) found that:\nJapanese and Turkish speakers were more likely to represent manner and path in two\nseparate gestures, whereas English speakers were more likely to represent manner and\npath in a single gesture ... In other words, how manner and path were packaged in a\nclause in a given language is reflected in how the two pieces of information were\npackaged in gestural representations.\n(Kita 2009: 155) 72 Understanding pragmatics\nBefore Kita illustrates the fourth and last factor \u2013 culture-specific gestural pragmatics\n\u2013 that governs variation in co-speech gestures he emphasizes the systematicity of usage\nof gesture for communication; he refers to this systematicity with the term \u2018gestural\npragmatics\u2019 (Kita 2009: 157).\nThe first example he uses for illustrating variation of co-speech gesture that is due\nto diversity in gestural pragmatics across cultures reveals that polite and impolite\nbehaviour also extends to gestures. Speakers of Ewe in Ghana respect a gestural\ntaboo; Kita and James Essegbey researched the profound impact of this taboo on the\ngesture practice of members of this speech community. The two scientists studied\npointing gestures during route descriptions that were provided by Ewe speakers. For\nthese speakers pointing by the left hand is considered to be a taboo. Kita and Essegbey\n(2001: 73) found that there is a convention to place the left hand on the lower back\nout of politeness while pointing with the right hand. Pointing with the right hand to\nindicate a leftward direction across the body \u2018may involve an anatomically straining\nposition\u2019: in this case \u2018right-handed pointing can be \u201chyper-contra-lateral\u201d ... in the\nsense that the arm crosses in front of the face or around the neck\u2019 (Kita and Essegbey\n2001: 83). To point with both hands does not violate the taboo. However, despite the\ntaboo, left-handed pointing is not completely suppressed: \u2018When the left hand\nindicates a direction, the gesture is often reduced in size and performed in the\nperiphery. Some gestures are made in such an inconspicuous way ... that they no\nlonger count as gestures for the purpose of taboo\u2019 (Kita and Essegbey 2001: 92). With\nthis case study Kita and Essegbey illustrate how the left hand pointing taboo\nregulates both how to gesture and how not to gesture. The taboo creates \u2018a complex\nsystem of gestural politeness, which gives the Ghanaian gestural practice a distinct\nflavour\u2019 (Kita 2009: 159).\nAnother obvious difference in co-speech gestures across cultures is the nodding\nbehaviour of Japanese speakers on the one hand and American English speakers (and\nspeakers of many other Indo-European languages) on the other. Maynard (1993)\nfound that Japanese speakers nod three times more often than American English\nspeakers in naturalistic conversations. American English and Japanese speakers\nusually nod at the end of a proposition; however, in a conversation both Japanese\nspeakers and addressees also systematically nod in the middle of a proposition. Kita\nand Sachiko Ide (2007) found that the \u2018major phrase boundaries are all potential\nlocations for the addressee to nod\u2019 (Kita 2009: 159). They interpret this finding not\nonly as being responsible for the higher nodding frequency in Japanese conversations,\nbut they also emphasize that these frequent nods establish social bonds between the\ninteractants. Kita elaborates on this important pragmatic function of nods in Japanese\nas follows \u2013 referring to corresponding research by Markus and Kitayama (1991):\nIt has been suggested the culture-specific patterns of nodding are due to what is\nconsidered to be important in social interaction in the culture. Frequent exchange of\nnodding in Japanese conversation may stem from Japanese emphasis on cooperation\nand consideration for others or more generally from socially defined self in Japanese\nculture ... Japanese tend to see oneself as part of an encompassing social relationship\nand [recognize] that one\u2019s behavior is determined, contingent on, and to a large extent Pragmatics and psychology 73\norganized by what the actor perceives to be the thoughts, feelings and actions of others\nin the relationship.\n(Kita 2009: 159f.)\nThus Kita shows that nodding shapes conversations in different ways in different\ncultures. These differences are due to gestural pragmatics that are based on the\nrespective speakers\u2019 culture-specific values with respect to social interaction in general\nand communication in particular.\n2.4.4 Pragmatic gestures\nIn his notes on pragmatic and social aspects of everyday gestures Llu\u00eds Payrat\u00f3 (2004:\n107) points out that \u2018the pragmatic roles and illocutionary values of autonomous\ngestures have been asserted in many analyses, and were even foreseen by Austin\u2019s ...\nwork on speech acts\u2019. And, as Payrat\u00f3 emphasizes, Austin indeed explicitly states:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that \u2018many conventional acts, such as betting or conveyance of property, can be\nperformed in non-verbal ways\u2019 (Austin 1962: 19);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that there are \u2018actions which are non-linguistic but similar to performative\nutterances in that they are the performance of a conventional action\u2019 (Austin\n1962: 69);\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that \u2018[w]e may accompany the utterance of the words by gestures (winks, pointings,\nshruggings, frowns, etc.) or by ceremonial non-verbal actions. These may\nsometimes serve without the utterance of any words, and their importance is\nobvious\u2019 (Austin 1962: 76); and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that \u2018we can for example warn or order or appoint or give or protest or apologize by\nnon-verbal means and these are illocutionary acts\u2019 (Austin 1962: 119).\nPayrat\u00f3 (2004: 107) also refers to Mary Ritchie Key (1977: 7f.), who lists a number of\ngestures that have illocutionary force. Most of these gestures are emblems which\nKendon (1988a: 136) understands as \u2018functional equivalents of a complete speech act\u2019.\nThese gestures are conventionalized. There are a number of other gestures that also\nhave a conventionalized form and seem to be standardized with respect to their\nmeanings and functions \u2013 like emblems; however, these gestures \u2018do not display\naspects of the propositional content of the verbal utterance, but mark the specific role\nthe verbal element plays in the discourse\u2019 (Seyfeddinipur: 2004: 206). Kendon (1995:\n247) refers to these gestures as \u2018pragmatic\u2019 gestures. They \u2018indicate types of speech act\nor aspects of discourse structure\u2019. Kendon (1995; see also 2000) describes the contexts\nof use of four such \u2018pragmatic gestures\u2019, two emblems that \u2018express the illocutionary\nintent of the spoken utterance associated with them\u2019 and two gestures that \u2018relate to\ndiscourse structure\u2019, one which \u2018marks \u201ctopic\u201d as distinct from \u201ccomment\u201d\u2019 and one\nwhich \u2018marks the \u201cfocality\u201d of a unit in relation to the theme\u2019 (Kendon 1995: 247).\nThese pragmatic gestures were documented during natural conversations made near\nSalerno in southern Italy. 74 Understanding pragmatics\nKendon describes the use of the two \u2018illocutionary marker\u2019 gestures to which Italian\nspeakers refer as Mano a borsa \u2013 \u2018purse hand\u2019 and Mani giunte \u2013 \u2018joined hands/praying\nhands\u2019. Kendon describes the Mano a borsa as follows:\nIn the \u2018purse hand\u2019 ... all the digits of the hand are fully extended, but they are drawn\ntogether so that they are in contact with one another at their tips ... The hand, shaped\nin this fashion is held with the palm facing upwards, although in some cases we see it\nwith the palm facing somewhat toward the body mid-line. It may be moved up and\ndown, by forearm action, usually with movement of relatively short amplitude.\n(Kendon 1995: 249)\nThis gesture indicates that the gesturer is making a request, like \u2018Come to the point!\nExplain yourself clearly!\u2019, and to accentuate \u2018the amazed, bored or indifferent tone of\nthe question\u2019 (Kendon 1995: 250).21 Kendon provides a number of contexts in which\nthis gesture is used. In one such situation a speaker is asking an interlocutor whom he\ncan contact to carry out a certain task. \u2018As he asks the question \u201cA chi vac\u2019 a truva\u2019 io\nmo\u2019 a chest? \u2013 Who do I go to find now for this?\u201d he forms the Mano a borsa which is\nmaintained throughout the utterance\u2019 (Kendon 1995: 251). Kendon states that this\ngesture can \u2018serve as the visual equivalent of the grammatical structure and intonation\nof the speech it accompanies\u2019. However, it can also be continued after the speaker has\nfinished speaking and then serve as the \u2018visual cue that a question has been asked and\nan answer is expected\u2019 (Kendon 1995: 251f.). According to Kendon the Mano a borsa\nmarks that speakers are:\nmaking a request for some information [when they are] seeking clarification [or] an\nexplanation of justification for something ... [others have] said or done ... The gesture\nserves ... as a way of making explicit, through visual means, the type of speech act or\nillocutionary act that the speaker intends or has intended with a given utterance.\n(Kendon 1995: 258)\nThe Mani giunte gesture \u2018is one in which the two hands, each with fingers extended and\nadducted, are placed in contact, palms facing one another, rather as is done in the gesture\ncommonly employed among Christians as a gesture of religious prayer\u2019 (Kendon 1995:\n258f.). Kendon describes it as a gesture \u2018begging for indulgence\u2019 and of \u2018imploring someone\ninsistently\u2019 and paraphrases it with the questions \u2018What can I do? ... And I, what can I do?\u2019.\nIn one of the contexts Kendon provides to illustrate the use of this gesture, somebody is\nasked to make a phone call. He replies \u2018But I have a council meeting in a moment! ... [and\nas] he says this he enacts Mani giunte \u2013 thus making it clear that he is asking the other\nperson to ... relieve him of the responsibility of making the call\u2019. The gesture \u2018serves as an\nappeal to the listener to accept the logical consequences of what the speaker has been saying\u2019\n(Kendon 1995: 259). Gestures like the Mano a borsa and the Mani giunte are called\nillocutionary markers by Kendon because \u2018they appear to give visible expression to the\nillocutionary act intended by the speaker\u2019 (Kendon 1995: 264).\nOther pragmatic gestures mark discourse units. The \u2018Finger Bunch\u2019 \u2013 \u2018a gesture in\nwhich the hand is held with fingers drawn together, much as in the Mano a borsa, but Pragmatics and psychology 75\nin which it is moved forward or downward, away from the self\u2019 (Kendon 1995: 264) \u2013\noccurs often when the speaker specifies a topic. When the hand is moved away and\ndownwards and when it opens so that the fingers are extended and spread it then\ngesturally specifies the comment on the topic gesturally marked before. Kendon points\nout that this:\ngrasping action has been interpreted ... as an action symbolic of seizing something and\nholding it ... the gesture grasps the topic being specified, holds it up or moves it toward\nthe interlocutor and then, in the terminal finger opening action, the comment made\non the topic is presented.\n(Kendon 1995: 264)\nThe \u2018Ring\u2019 \u2013 a gesture in which \u2018the tip of the index finger is brought into contact with\nthat of the thumb\u2019 \u2013 has several functions. Among other things it:\noccurs in association with a segment of speech that provides precise information,\nmakes a specific reference to something, makes something specific in contrast to other\npossibilities or in contrast to something more general, or which gives a specific example\nof something.\n(Kendon 1995: 268)\nThus, the \u2018Ring\u2019 also marks discourse units indicating their status within the discourse\n(see also Neumann 2004).\n2.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis chapter provided an introduction to another central topic in linguistic pragmatics\n\u2013 namely deixis, the system we use to refer to and communicate about objects, living\nbeings, places, periods of time and even texts or text passages in specific contexts. The\nstudy of deixis reveals how languages encode features of the context of the utterance and\nhow they select specific topics and items of their discourse in the various contexts given.\nAfter a general characterization of the different kinds and modes of pointing, the\ncharacteristic features, the complexities and intricacies of various systems and means of\nspatial deixis found in the languages of the world were illustrated, emphasizing the\ncontext-dependency of the use of these indexicals which shift from context to context.\nMoreover, it was shown that, like other forms of reference by verbal means, these forms\nof spatial deictic reference constitute a collaborative task for speaker and hearer.\nDeictic gestures and other forms of gesture are also used as indexicals. The second\npart of this chapter dealt with gestures in general. Discussing the interrelationship\nbetween gesture, language and mind, different gesture forms and their communicative\nand social functions were described; co-speech gestures, which are primarily designed\nfor addressees, were differentiated from co-thought gestures, which are produced by\nspeakers just for themselves; it was pointed out that these co-thought gestures not only\nreflect thought but support thinking in certain problem-solving situations. It was also 76 Understanding pragmatics\npointed out that gesture and speech can be combined to convey different information\n\u2013 that is to say, gestures add information to the speaker\u2019s verbal utterance. It was shown\nthat the interrelationship between language, gesture and mind also governs cross-\ncultural and cross-linguistic variation of gestures. Finally it was illustrated that\ngestures not only have their own pragmatics, but that there are also pragmatic gestures\nthat serve explicit pragmatic functions.\nBoth the study of indexicals and co-speech gestures are extremely important for the\nresearch of actual language use because they provide direct evidence for the fact that\nhuman interaction is multimodal.\nWhat does this chapter tell us about the anecdote which I reported in the introduction\nto this volume? It illustrates that once I had learned how to appropriately react to the\nspecific form of Trobriand greeting I correctly used indexicals \u2013 in the example\nappropriate motion verbs within a complex serial verb construction \u2013 to provide the\ninformation wanted. And although I have no video documents of my own behaviour\nI remember that I pointed to my towel, metaphorically referring to the activity and\nplace related to the use of it, and I am sure that I also pointed to where I thought the\nfresh water well was located in the bush. This latter gesture was rather vague \u2013 the\nTrobriand Islanders do not have an absolute system of spatial reference that can be\ncompared to that of Australian Aboriginals, so I did not need to learn how to dead-\nreckon my position with respect to the water cave to be able to produce a correct\npointing gesture in such an absolute frame of spatial reference.\n2.6 EXERCISE/WORK SECTION\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Take a detective story or any other short story or novel of your choice, check the first\nfive pages for at least two examples of the verbal expressions used by the author for\npersonal, social, temporal and spatial deictic reference and discuss the context-\ndependence of these indexicals.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Check a political speech documented in the internet for utterances that document\ngestural deictic, symbolic deictic, anaphoric and non-anaphoric usage of indexicals.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Where is \u2018here\u2019?

See also subsection 2.3 examples (12) to (15) below. Note that \u2018(co-)reference\u2019 is a\ncommon cover term for discourse-internal use of deictic elements.\n5 With respect to the problem of space and time and personal/social deixis see, e.g. Anderson\nand Keenan (1985); Boroditsky and Gaby (2010); Clark (1973: 48\u201350); Ehrich (1992); Enfield\nand Stivers (2007); Fillmore (1975: 28); Lyons (1982: 114f., 121); Weissenborn and Klein\n(1982).\n6 In the sentence \u2018The socks are in the drawer\u2019 one differentiates between the entity to be\nsituated, the \u2018theme\u2019 or the \u2018figure\u2019, namely the socks, and the reference object or the entity\nin relation to which the theme is situated \u2013 which is called the \u2018relatum\u2019 or \u2018ground\u2019 \u2013\nnamely the drawer.

For a\nrejection of Denny\u2019s hypothesis and for a completely different position see Fillmore\n(1982: 48f.). 78 Understanding pragmatics\n9 This subsection is based on the detailed description provided in Senft (2004b).\n10 There are other systems of spatial deixis that are not speaker based, like, e.g. the person-\noriented system of the Oceanic language Saliba which differentiates on the one hand\nbetween a proximal category near the speaker and a proximal category near the addressee;\nand a general distal category on the other (see Margetts 2004).\n11 Besa or beya are also used as presentatives that can be glossed as \u2018That\u2019s it here!\u2019 or as \u2018There\nyou are\u2019.\n12 Kilivila has a numeral classifier system; however, the language uses its classifiers also for\nthe word formation of (all but one) demonstratives and some adjectives. Languages with\nnumeral classifiers have the following characteristic feature: in counting inanimate and\nanimate referents, the numerals (obligatorily) concatenate with a certain morpheme \u2013 the\nso-called \u2018classifier\u2019. This morpheme classifies and quantifies the respective nominal\nreferent according to semantic criteria (see Senft 1991, 1996a).\n13 For details see Senft (1996a).\n14 See: http://fieldmanuals.mpi.nl/volumes/1999/1999-demonstrative-questionnaire-this-that/\n15 There is a fourfold series of possessive pronouns in Kilivila. The series of pronouns that\nmark inalienable possession and are suffixed to most of the body part terms are labelled as\n\u2018possessive pronouns IV\u2019, abbreviated as \u2018PP.IV\u2019.\n16 See also examples 27, 29, 34b, and 38 above.\n17 Here is an example: Tau e-tota omatala kai.\nman 3-stand in.front.of tree\nA man is standing in front of a tree.\n18 For a survey on the history of Western interest in gesture, see Kendon (2004, Chapters 3\nand 4); see also McNeill (1992: 2ff.) and de Jorio (2000); for the discussion of Wundt\u2019s role\nsee Kendon (2004: 57ff.); also McNeill (1992: 3).\n19 See, e.g. Kendon (2004: 73f.); see also Emmorey (2001); Sandler and Lillo-Martin (2006).\nLike spoken languages, sign languages are fully formed natural languages in their own\nright. Therefore, they will not be discussed in more detail here. Note that gestures also co-\noccur with signing (see, e.g. Liddell [2003]; Duncan [2005]).\n20 See also Kelly et al. (2010) who confirm the integrated-systems hypothesis and demonstrate\nthat gesture and speech form an integrated system in language comprehension.\n21 Some of my Italian colleagues point out that this gesture is also used to express annoyance\nand even anger and that it is sometimes made with both hands. 3\nPragmatics and human ethology\nBiological foundations of communicative behaviour\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nGestures represent only one aspect of the multimodality of speech and verbal interaction.\nThere are a number of other forms of expressive behaviour that accompany speech and\nare important for verbal interactions. Human ethology is the subdiscipline of biology\nthat deals among other things with the communicative functions of the various forms of\nexpressive behaviour. After a brief discussion of the ethological concepts \u2018expressive\nmovement\u2019 and \u2018signal\u2019, the first part of this chapter discusses the communicatively very\nimportant behavioural signals manifest in facial expressions. Ever since Charles Bell\n(1774\u20131842), Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) and Guillaume Duchenne (1806\u20131875), facial\nexpressions of emotions and inner feelings have been researched from various angles.\nThe research on emotion by Paul Ekman and his colleagues kept the Darwinian\nperspective alive. But this research has always been a highly controversial topic. Based on\nIren\u00e4us Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s criticism of Ekman\u2019s research on emotions and on his\ncontributions to facial expressions from the perspective of human ethology, the first part\nof this chapter highlights the form and function of eyebrow raising \u2013 a signal that\ncommunicates first and foremost a person\u2019s openness for social contact.\nIn 1968 Edward T. Hall showed that people in different cultures utilize different\nculture-specific distance norms. By means of personal distances we mark individual\nand group territories \u2013 and this has implications for posture behaviour and body\nmotion. The communicative functions of body posture, motion and position will also\nbe discussed in the first part of this chapter.\nThe second half of this chapter on the influence of human ethology on linguistic\npragmatics first discusses the concepts \u2018ritual\u2019 and \u2018ritual communication\u2019 in some\nmore detail and then presents and discusses Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s hypothesis regarding\nuniversal interaction strategies. He claims that rituals and forms of ritual\ncommunication can be understood as the differentiation of what he calls \u2018basic\ninteraction strategies\u2019. The heuristic value of this assumption is illustrated by rituals of\nrequesting, giving and taking documented in the speech community of the Eipo in\nWest Papua and by complex forms of ritual communication observed and documented\nduring a so-called \u2018palm fruit festival\u2019 celebrated by the Yanomam\u00f6 of the upper\nOrinoco in Venezuela. Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s hypothesis is then discussed in connection\nwith Stephen Levinson\u2019s recent ideas about a \u2018universal systematics of interaction\u2019 and\n\u2018building blocks for cultural diversity in social interaction\u2019 that are provided by what\nhe calls the \u2018interaction engine\u2019 (Levinson 2006: 61f.). 80 Understanding pragmatics\n3.2 EXPRESSIVE MOVEMENTS AND THEIR RITUALIZATION INTO SIGNALS\nFor human ethologists, that is biologists and behavioural physiologists investigating\nhuman behaviour, gestures belong to the class of expressive movements which they\ndefine as \u2018behavior patterns that have undergone distinctive differentiation in the\nservice of signaling\u2019 during processes of ritualization (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 438).\nThey point out that any behavioural pattern can become such a signal either in the\ncourse of evolution or because of conventions that are valid within a specific\ncommunity in which these signals are culturally transmitted and acquired. The\nprerequisite condition for the development of an expressive movement into a signal\nis that it has to regularly accompany a specific arousal condition. An arousal\ncondition is defined as a psychological and physiological state in humans (and\nanimals) in which an individual is attentive and reactive to perceived stimuli in such\na way that others can easily recognize her or his disposition and emotional reaction\nto these stimuli and her or his intentions for further action. These signals may be\nphysically determined concomitant phenomena of an emotional state, for example\nblushing or trembling, or they may be behaviour patterns that fulfil a specific\nfunction, like forms of friendly bonding behaviour or forms of aggressive behaviour\nlike hitting or just threatening to hit \u2013 signals that are immediately understood, even\nby animals, as being either friendly or dangerous. To emphasize it once more, these\nexpressive movements are performed and perceived as indicators of a person\u2019s\nreadiness to act. When behavioural patterns become ritualized and are thus\ndeveloped into signals, they undergo changes that make the signal more prominent\nand unequivocal to improve its communicative function. During these ritualization\nprocesses the movements are usually simplified and often repeated rhythmically,\noften getting exaggerated, while they either vary with respect to their intensity or are\nexecuted with a typical intensity.\nAmong these signals we find, for example, aggressive tongue display in sticking\nout the tongue: here the tongue is protruded or bent downward and held for some\ntime. This is a signal that marks rejection. Human ethologists explain this expressive\nmovement as derived from the refusal to take food in a process of phylogenetic\nritualization. However, there is also a friendly form of tongue display, the tongue\nflicking which is a signal of contact readiness. Here the tongue is either arched\nupward or simply extended, but for a short period of time. Other such signals are\ndeveloped in processes of cultural ritualizations, like, for example, the \u2018measured\nstep of a dignitary\u2019 or \u2018the parade of marching soldiers\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt: 1989:\n438ff.).\nFacial expressions are a specific form of these signals, because the \u2018face is one of the\nmost important reference points in interpersonal communication\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt\n1989: 443). It is not accidental that we speak of face-to-face interaction and\ncommunication. We transmit many signals with our face, be it by moving our eyes, by\nunconscious changes in the pupillary size1 or by moving our facial muscles (both\nconsciously and unconsciously). With many of these facial muscle movements we\nexpress our emotional states. The next subsection discusses facial expressions. Pragmatics and human ethology 81\n3.2.1 Facial expressions\nCharles Bell (1806), Charles Darwin (1872) and Guillaume Duchenne (1876) were the\npioneers in the field of researching the facial expression of emotions. Bell\u2019s work and\n\u2013 even more so \u2013 Duchenne\u2019s studies on facial muscles and emotional expressions in\nthe face played an important role in Darwin\u2019s seminal contribution to the field. In\nDarwin\u2019s view, universal emotions and hard-wired facial expressions which reflect\nthem should yield clear universal categories \u2013 with predicted agreement across\ncommunities in the terminology expressing the corresponding emotions. Duchenne\u2019s\nresearch question \u2013 which facial muscles are used to coordinate facial expressions \u2013\nwas taken up by Carl-Herman Hjortsj\u00f6\u2019s (1969) study in which he describes 23 facial\nmuscles, lists 24 facial expressions and discusses \u2018in precise anatomical terms how the\ncontraction of individual muscles influenced the resulting facial expression\u2019 (Eibl-\nEibesfeldt 1989: 445). His research laid the foundation for Paul Ekman and Wallace\nFriesen\u2019s studies that resulted in their Facial Action Coding System (Ekman and\nFriesen 1975, 1978). Ekman and his co-workers have played an important role in\nkeeping the Darwinian perspective alive by claiming the existence of a small set of\nuniversal basic emotions with universally corresponding expressions reflecting\nadaptive \u2018affect programmes\u2019 like mating, defence, and flight. Among the basic\nemotions that are claimed to be recognized from facial expressions by all human\nbeings are (at least) the six emotions \u2018Happiness, Surprise, Fear, Anger, Disgust\u2019 and\n\u2018Sadness\u2019. In addition, Ekman (1973: 220) also makes the following rather bold claim:\n\u2018Regardless of the language, or whether the culture is \u2026 industrialized or preliterate,\nfacial expressions are labeled with the same emotion terms\u2019. To verify their hypotheses\nEkman and his colleagues presented photographs of facial expressions that they\nthemselves had classified as prototypically representing the six emotions claimed to be\nuniversal to consultants in various cultures and speech communities.2\nResearch on emotions and their facial expression has a relatively long tradition, but it\nhas always been a highly controversial topic (see, e.g. Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 450ff.; the\ncontroversy between Ekman 1994 and Russell 1994; also Izard and Saxton 1988). A\nrather strong argument against Ekman\u2019s approach starts with the observation that\nemotions are not just displayed by means of facial expressions; on the contrary, the\nexpression of emotions and inner feelings is manifest in complex behaviour patterns\nwhich control and regulate not only facial expressions, but also posture and position of\nthe body, muscular tonus, gesture, speech utterances, voice, pitch, personal distance\nbetween interactors, eye-contact or its avoidance, skin temperature, pulse rate, etc. Some\nof the expressive motor patterns that constitute these behaviour patterns are \u2018fixed action\npatterns\u2019, which are innate \u2013 as proven in research on the expressive behaviour of deaf-\nand-blind-born children, however, many other of these behaviour patterns are ritualized\nin culture-specific ways. Even if we accept Ekman\u2019s claim that there is a set of basic\nemotions, these basic emotions are expressed not just in the face, but in much more\ncomplex interactional behaviour patterns \u2013 which may have even evolved into (ritualized)\ninteraction strategies (see Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1973a, 1989: 466, 492, 520f., 546f.). Therefore,\nphotographs of static facial expressions must be taken to be a rather inadequate means to\nelicit terms for the emotions claimed to be expressed by these \u2018frozen\u2019 facial expressions. 82 Understanding pragmatics\nCriticism of Ekman\u2019s claims came not only from human ethologists like Eibl-\nEibesfeldt and psychologists like Russell, but also from anthropologists. From this\ntradition of close attention to cultural detail has come severe criticism of Ekman\u2019s\nunderstanding of basic emotions as universal human traits. Anthropologists noted\ninteresting culture-specific concepts embedded in local \u2018ethnopsychologies\u2019. Rosaldo\n(1983), for example, showed that with the Ilongot, an ethnical group living in the\nPhilippines, the concept liget, which can be glossed as \u2018anger\u2019, is closely tied to the\nintense emotions involved in headhunting (for other such examples see the contributions\nin Levy 1983; see also Kuipers 1998). Pilot studies on the expression of emotions in\nvarious languages that were carried out at the MPI for Psycholinguistics also indicate\nthat Ekman\u2019s claim that facial expressions are labelled with corresponding emotion\nterms across languages and cultures is untenable (Senft 2009a, 2012).\nThere is no space here to discuss Ekman\u2019s theories about facial expressions and their\nuniversality in more detail. It must be noted, however, that whenever people display\nemotions and inner feelings through the complex behaviour patterns mentioned\nabove, we are not too bad at recognizing their moods. A plausible explanation for this\nis that people never express their emotions and inner feelings just by facial expressions\n\u2013 their total behaviour provides us with a number of different cues on which we can\nbase our hypotheses about the mood they are in.\nWith their Facial Action Coding System, however, Ekman and Friesen (1978)\ndeveloped a useful tool for describing \u2013 but not for interpreting and explaining \u2013 facial\nmuscle motions. In what follows I will describe the so-called \u2018eyebrow flash\u2019, the rapid\nraising of the eyebrows which has been documented on film in various cultures\nespecially by Eibl-Eibesfeldt and his co-workers (see, e.g. Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 117,\n452ff.; Grammer et al. 1988)3. Eibl-Eibesfeldt describes this facial event as follows:\nIt follows visual contact and is embedded within a typical sequence of behavioral\npatterns. Upon establishing visual contact the head is usually lifted a bit and the\neyebrows are then raised for approximately 1/3 second, while a smile simultaneously\nspreads; as a concluding gesture the person often nods the head.\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 452f.)\nEibl-Eibesfeldt describes the various expressive functions of eyebrow raising as follows:\nThe origin of rapid eyebrow raising is probably a ritualized expression of friendly\nrecognition. It occurs in situations of congenial affection, as in thanking, consenting,\nflirting, greeting, agreeing, surprise, and encouraging, and thus has a broad spectrum\nof meanings but always within the context of contact readiness and expressing some\nkind of assent ... Rapid eyebrow raising is distinguished from a slower raising of the\neyebrows, which is an expression of rejection and provocation ... The visual field is\nexpanded by raising the brows and this probably leads to eyebrow raising in contexts\nof curiosity, surprise, and inquiry ... Finally there is the slow eyebrow raising as an\nexpression of indignation, arrogance, social rejection and factual \u2018no\u2019.\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 453ff.; see also Eibl-Eibesfeldt and Senft 1987: 30) Pragmatics and human ethology 83\nEibl-Eibesfeldt notes that he could document this behaviour in mother-child\ninteractions and in situations of friendly contact establishment in all the cultures he\nstudied; however, he concedes that cultural differences exist. Rapid eyebrow raising as\nan expression of factual \u2018yes\u2019 occurs only in a few cultures (e.g. in Polynesia) while slow\neyebrow raising as a factual \u2018no\u2019 is restricted to some Mediterranean people, as is well\nknown. Greeting strangers in a friendly context with the eyebrow flash is observed in\nmany cultures; however, in Japan it would be inappropriate for adults to greet each\nother in such a way. Eibl-Eibesfeldt conjectures that the origin of the eyebrow flash lies\nin the functional movement of opening the eyes to see better; he emphasizes, however,\nthat this is just a hypothesis (see Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 455).\nUsing Ekman\u2019s Facial Action Coding System, Karl Grammer and his colleagues\nanalysed 233 events of rapid eyebrow raising in unstaged social interactions that were\nfilmed by Eibl-Eibesfeldt in three cultures \u2013 the Eipo of West Papua, the Trobriand\nIslanders of Papua New Guinea and the Yanomam\u00f6 Indians of the upper Orinoco in\nVenezuela. The ethologists observed that the pattern of muscle action was almost\nidentical in the three cultures. Moreover, they found that the time structure of the\nevent is similar in all three cultures:\nThe eyebrow movement itself represents a marked change in the behavioural flow:\nafter a pause in all other facial movements it typically starts with a fast onset (80ms),\nfollowed by a variable period or standstill, and from where it returns slowly to its\nstarting point (120ms).\n(Grammer et al. 1988: 297)\nEyebrow raising appears most frequently together with smiling and upward moving of\nthe head. Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1989: 117ff.) takes this result as a confirmation of his\ninterpretation of the eyebrow flash as being first and foremost a form of greeting\nbehaviour that signals \u2018yes to social contact\u2019. It signals that its sender is ready and willing\nfor interaction and encourages its recipient(s) to initiate interaction. Thus, the eyebrow\nflash is typically used as a ritualized form of greeting, signalling friendly openness for\nsocial contact; it contributes to establishing and maintaining a social bond between\ninteractants. The next subsection shows that we send communicative signals not only\nwith facial expressions, but also with our body motions, postures and positions.\n3.2.2 Personal distance and body motion behaviour: Proxemics and kinesics\nEthologists have also shown that humans are both attracted to others and at the same\ntime fear them. They refer to this kind of fear with the technical term \u2018social fear\u2019 and\nclaim that \u2018it is alleviated with personal acquaintance but remains a principal\ncharacteristic of interpersonal behavior\u2019. As a result, \u2018we maintain various degrees of\ngreater distance between ourselves and others depending on the amount of confidence\nwe have in the other\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 335). It is claimed that these individual\ndistances are learned and that they are different in different cultures.\nIn 1966 Edward T. Hall published his seminal article on human distance\nmaintenance, with which he founded the discipline called \u2018proxemics\u2019. He defines the 84 Understanding pragmatics\ndiscipline as \u2018the study of man\u2019s perception and use of space [that] deals primarily with\nthe out-of-awareness distance-setting\u2019 (Hall 1968: 83). His research revealed that\npeople in different cultures differ as to how much berth they give to others when\ninteracting. Hall observed, for example, that\nAmericans overseas were confronted with a variety of difficulties because of cultural\ndifferences in the handling of space. People stood \u201ctoo close\u201d during conversations,\nand when the Americans backed away to a comfortable conversational distance, this\nwas taken to mean that Americans were cold, aloof, withdrawn and disinterested in\nthe people of the country.\n(Hall 1968: 84)\nHe found that \u2018northern Europeans maintain a greater distance between themselves\nthan Mediterraneans and Arabians do\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 335). Moreover,\ncomparing Americans with Arabs, Hall made the following observations:\nThe Arab stares; the American does not. The Arab\u2019s olfactory sense is actively involved\nin establishing and maintaining contact. Arabs tend to stay inside the olfactory bubble\nof their interlocutor, Whereas Americans try to stay outside of it.\n(Hall 1968: 94)\nHe points out that such \u2018differences in the proxemic behaviour lead to ... \u201calienation in\nencounters\u201d\u2019 and thus interfere with, or even terminate, verbal interactions between\nspeakers coming from cultures with different needs for personal distance in everyday\nface-to-face communication. Hall summarizes his observations as follows:\nPhysical contact between people, breathing on people or directing one\u2019s breath away\nfrom people, direct eye contact or averting one\u2019s gaze, placing one\u2019s face so close to\nanother that visual accommodation is not possible, are all examples of the kind of\nproxemic behavior that may be perfectly correct in one culture and absolutely taboo in\nanother.\n(Hall 1968: 88)\nGiven these observations he differentiates between \u2018contact\u2019 cultures and \u2018distance\u2019\ncultures. On the basis of kinesthesia (e.g. one person has elbow room, just outside of\ntouching distance), thermal receptors, olfaction (e.g. washed skin/hair, breath), and\nvision he defines for \u2018Americans of North European heritage\u2019 the following four\ndistances \u2013 which vary with the relationship and acquaintance of the interactants:\nintimate distance (0\u201340cm), personal distance (40\u2013120cm), social distance or normal,\nsocial-consultive distance (120\u2013400cm), and public distance (400\u2013800cm), e.g. the\ndistance between a speaker and his audience (see Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 338).\nFrederick Erickson (1975: 176) found that \u2018changes in interpersonal distance during\ninteraction (\u201cproxemic shifts\u201d...) seem to accompany changes in the topic or in the\nsocial relationship between speakers\u2019. His analyses of filmed college counselling\ninterviews revealed that: Pragmatics and human ethology 85\nproxemic shifts occur very frequently at the beginning and ending of segments of\ninteraction that can also be identified by changes of speech content and style, and by\nchanges in the interaction process. This suggests that proxemic shifts may function as\nindicators of situational shifts and topic changes in an interaction.\n(Erickson 1975: 186)\nPersonal distances are instantiations of human territoriality. We mark personal\ndistance as well as individual and group territories \u2013 for example with a \u2018jacket over a\nlibrary chair\u2019 or a warning sign on one\u2019s property like \u2018No Trespassing\u2019, and we respect\nthe space of others (see Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 337).\nHuman territoriality has also implications for posture behaviour and body\nmotion with which we control the territory that is claimed in, and for\n(conversational) interaction. Ray Birdwhistell (1970) refers to the study of such\nforms of communicative body motion behaviour (including gestures) with the\nterm \u2018Kinesics\u2019. Adam Kendon (1977) and Robert Deutsch (1977) pointed out that\nparticipants in conversation (in Europe and in Anglo-Saxon cultures) usually\nhave visual contact and look at each other. Here conversation usually means face-\nto-face interaction. However, we also observe arrangements in dyadic conversations\nin which the \u2018two participants stand so that the frontal surfaces of their bodies fall\non the two arms of an L\u2019 as well as side-by-side arrangements, \u2018where they stand\nclose together, both facing the same way\u2019 (Kendon 1977: 183). These spatial\narrangements may change in association with a change in the topic of the talk (see\nKendon 1977: 192ff.). If the participants in a conversation are seated, postural\nchanges indicate such a topic shift.\nIf two persons talk to each other, a third person who wants to join this dyad cannot\nsimply intrude on such a dyad (nor can a fourth person simply intrude on a triad,\netc.) \u2013 the interactants have to grant access \u2013 and they usually do this by changing\ntheir posture and position; they turn away from each other, thus opening the closed\ndyad and granting access to the new person (Kendon 1977: 202f.; see also Eibl-\nEibesfeldt 1989: 488). Similarly, one cannot simply leave such a group; one has to\nmark with positional changes or with gaze behaviour that one intends to part.\nKendon points out that one usually moves away from the position one had in the\nconversational group, then one steps back, excuses oneself for having to leave and\nsays goodbye. Only then does one walk away, first a few steps in a direction that is\ndifferent from the direction finally taken. Before one moves towards this final\ndirection one may glance back to the group one is leaving (Kendon 1977: 203). This\nkind of ritualized form of leaving a group with which one had engaged in conversation\nis important \u2013 at least in Western cultures \u2013 \u2018since an abrupt departure signifies\nbreaking off contact or the threat of such an action. This is avoided in the situation\nof a friendly farewell\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 488 ff.). The reason for this behaviour is\nto maintain the bond with the members of the group one is leaving and to secure\nthat one is granted access to such a group again when one wants to join it on a\npossible further occasion. 86 Understanding pragmatics\n3.3 RITUALS, RITUAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION STRATEGIES\nAfter some general remarks on ritual and ritual communication, this subsection\ndiscusses Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s ethological concept of basic interaction strategies. Analyses\nof little rituals of requesting, giving and taking documented in the speech community\nof the Eipo of West Papua and of complex forms of ritual communication during a\nfestival celebrated by the Yanomam\u00f6 illustrate the heuristic value of this paradigm for\nthe pragmatic, anthropological-linguistic analysis of the genres discussed. The section\nends with a brief summary of Levinson\u2019s ideas about a \u2018universal systematics of\ninteraction\u2019 and \u2018building blocks for cultural diversity in social interaction\u2019 which are\nprovided by what he calls the \u2018interaction engine\u2019.\n3.3.1 Some general remarks on ritual and ritual communication\nThe expressive movements discussed in the previous subsections are performed and\nperceived as indicators of a person\u2019s readiness to act. In subsection 3.2 it was pointed\nout that these movements have undergone distinctive differentiation in the service of\nsignalling. In phylogenetic and cultural ritualization processes in which these signals\nare developed, expressive movements undergo changes that make the signals more\nprominent and unequivocal to improve their communicative functions: they are\nusually simplified and often repeated rhythmically, they get exaggerated, and they\neither vary with respect to their intensity or they are executed with a typical intensity.\nThis makes the behaviour of interactants predictable \u2013 at least to a certain degree \u2013 and\nwith this increase of the predictability of human behaviour rituals provide security\nand order in human interaction.\nMany discussions of ritual and ritualization, such as Goffman\u2019s (1967) essays on\nface-to-face behaviour (see subsection 5.2 below), emphasize functional criteria. It is\npointed out that one of the most important functions of rituals is to create and stabilize\nsocial relations. Social rites that serve the functions of bonding and aggression-\nblocking are central to the interaction of all living beings. Humans, however, do not\nhave to rely on just non-verbal signals to develop rituals; they can also use verbal means\nto reach this aim.\nThus, with humans we observe not only ritualized forms of non-verbal behaviour\nthat are used as signals in acts of communication \u2013 like, for example, the eyebrow flash\nand proxemic and posture behaviour in social interactions, but also ritualized forms of\nverbal communication. In the introduction of the anthology Ritual Communication\nthe concept is defined as:\nan undertaking or enterprise involving a making of cultural knowledge within locally\nvariant practices of speech-centered human interaction ...\n... [R]itual communication is artful, performed semiosis, predominantly but not\nonly involving speech, that is formulaic and repetitive and therefore anticipated within\nparticular contexts of social interaction. Ritual communication thus has anticipated\n(but not always achieved) consequences. As performance, it is subject to evaluation by Pragmatics and human ethology 87\nparticipants according to standards defined in part by language ideologies, local\naesthetics, contexts of use, and, especially, relations of power among participants.\n(Basso and Senft 2009: 1)\nIn Senft (2009b: 81f.) it was also pointed out that anyone who wants successfully to\nresearch the role of language in social interaction must know how any society\nresearched constructs its reality (Berger and Luckmann 1966) \u2013 one of the essentials of\nlinguistic pragmatics. It is a prerequisite that researchers must be on \u2018common ground\u2019\nwith the community researched. However, as Goffman (see Chapter Five) notes, this\nessential precondition is a rather general one: Every speaker of a natural language must\nlearn the rules of communicative behaviour that are valid for her or his speech\ncommunity. In the course of this learning process, one of the most important objectives\nis to understand and duplicate the construction of the speech community\u2019s common\nsocial reality (and this includes discovering norms by making mistakes).\nThe duplicated social construction of reality must be safeguarded and secured,\nespecially with respect to possible \u2018sites of fracture\u2019 such as cooperation, conflict, and\ncompetition within the community. The safeguarding of the duplicated social\nconstruction of reality is achieved partly through the ritualization of communication.\nThe ritualization of communication can contribute to relieving tension in critical\nsocial situations and to regulating social differences and dissension by increasing the\nharmonizing functions of speech, by creating and stabilizing social relations, and by\ndistancing emotions, impulses, and intentions. Ritualization of communication can\nincrease the predictability of human behaviour; moreover, it can open up space where\nbehaviour can be tried out without fear of social sanctions.\nTherefore, one can characterize ritual communication broadly as a type of strategic\naction that, among many other things, helps promote social bonding, block aggression,\nand dispel elements of danger that might affect a community\u2019s social harmony. It acts\nwithin the verbal domain by enabling people to voice these elements of danger and\nbring them up for discussion (see also Eibl-Eibesfeldt and Senft 1987: 75ff.).\nI will briefly illustrate this with William Labov\u2019s work on ritual insults in peer\ngroups of Black adolescents in Harlem, New York (Labov 1972b; see also subsection 6.3\nbelow). These rituals are duels with words. Labov not only analysed the complex\nstructures of this quite sophisticated form of ritual communication, but also\nemphasized that these verbal duels strengthen solidarity between peer group members\nby violating American middle class norms. Moreover, they also open up sanctuaries\nfor competition, in which individuals can test out their status with respect to the\nranking of other members within the group without too much danger of being\nsanctioned, because of the overall tacitly understood convention that these insults are\nritual ones and thus not meant personally. Possible escalations towards real forms of\naggression during sessions of ritual insults can be avoided by emphasizing the non-\npersonal character of the situation as a ritualized language game.4\nIt goes almost without saying, however, that ritual communication does not always\nsuccessfully fulfil the functions described above. As Ellen Basso (p.c.) has pointed out,\nthe duplication of the social construction of reality or the social truth of a locution does\nnot always accord with either the speaker\u2019s or the listener\u2019s experiencing of that 88 Understanding pragmatics\nsituation or one alluded to in the locution. However, aggression that might result from\nthis failure is usually suppressed because of the strong general societal requirement to\n\u2018be nice\u2019, or at least to \u2018follow the rules\u2019, valid for the respective group, even when\npeople do not feel that way. Thus emotions can be calmed, and voicing can be repressed.\nEspecially a society that offers few closed personal spaces to ensure privacy for\nindividuals depends on its members having a strong sense of tact. Houses like those of\nthe Trobriand Islanders that are made out of bush material with leaves as \u2018walls\u2019\nprovide private space that offers visual but no auditory protection. Therefore, one\nsometimes has to pretend not to (over)hear and not to note things said and done in the\nprivate realm of the inside of the house, and one must learn at an early age that one\ndoes not talk about these things. The general requirement of tactful behaviour, the\nnecessity to be nice, and the positive and successful effects of ritual communication\ncontribute to and create social harmony.\n3.3.2 The concept of basic interaction strategies\nEibl-Eibesfeldt (1989: 425\u2013547) argues that rituals and forms of ritual communication\ncan be referred back to so-called basic interaction strategies. He claims that all humans\nhave a finite set of these conventionalized strategies at their disposal and assumes that\nthese strategies are universal. Eibl-Eibesfeldt differentiates the following four\ninteraction strategies on the basis of their function and defines and subclassifies them\nas follows:\n1. Strategies of group maintenance and bonding\nThe function of these strategies is to establish, develop, maintain and repair\nsocial relationships, and to maintain group harmony and group unity.\na.) Strategies of friendly contact initiation\nGreeting rituals, strategies of integration\nStrategies of ... sexual approach (contact initiation, flirting)\nStrategies of play solicitation, exploration, and development of commonality\nb.) Strategies which reinforce bonds\nRituals of unification (... mother\u2013child bonding, synchronisation rituals,\ndemonstration of sympathy ..., rituals of group aggression ..., cultivation of\ncommon values, indoctrination)\nRituals of reciprocal care (gift giving rituals, hospitality, \u201cgrooming talk\u201d)5\nc.) Strategies maintaining group harmony\nStrategies to maintain group norms (bringing deviants into line by mocking,\ncensure, or aggression to maintain norms)\nStrategies of pacification (mediation, conflict resolution)\nStrategies of support (support, aid)\nStrategies of making amends (reconciliation, excusing oneself, atonement,\nmediation)\nStrategies to avoid challenges, appeasement (tactful approach, demonstrative\nrespect of the possession norm, rituals of recognition, such as admiration,\npraise, self deprecation, and other forms of appeasement) Pragmatics and human ethology 89\n2. Strategies of social learning and teaching\na.) Strategies of social exploration (exploratory aggression, ... imitation)\nb.) Strategies of instruction (encouragement, ... demonstration)\n3. Strategies of rank striving\na.) Strategies of self-presentation\nb.) Strategies of rank defense\nc.) Rituals of obedience (discipline reinforcement)\n4. Strategies of fighting\na.) Strategies of display and bluffing\nb.) Strategies of challenging\nc.) Strategies of attack and fighting (ritual fights)\nd.) Strategies of defense\ne.) Strategies of withdrawal\nf.) Strategies of reconciliation and peace-making\ng.) Strategies of submission\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 520f.)\nHe assumes that the ways people in different cultures try to acquire status, get a gift\nfrom someone, invite someone, or block aggression follow in principle the same basic\npatterns. On the basis of his own human-ethological field research, Eibl-Eibesfeldt\nconcludes:\nThe superficial appearance of human interactive behaviors varies enormously from\nculture to culture, but with closer examination we can recognize that the various\nstrategies of social interaction share a universal pattern, based upon a universal rule\nsystem. Within this regulating system, behaviors of different origins but with similar\nfunctions can substitute for each other as functional equivalents ...\n... Those things that children in all cultures express nonverbally in essentially the\nsame way, adults translate into words, but this verbal behavior follows the same rules\nunderlying the corresponding nonverbal interactions.\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 522)\nThus \u2013 according to Eibl-Eibesfeldt \u2013 many rituals and forms of ritual communication\ncan be traced back to, or at least be understood as, the differentiation of this finite set\nof elemental interaction strategies. Despite their richness of variation, they are just\nculture-specific expressions of these basic strategies. They constitute a universal\nsystem channelling social behaviour.\nRituals and forms of ritual communication can be relatively simple and mundane or\nhighly complex and situation-specific. They can be located on a cline of structural,\n(con)textual, and sociocultural complexity (see Senft 2009b: 83). In what follows\neveryday rituals of requesting, giving and taking in the Eipo speech community in\nWest Papua and forms of ritual communication of the Yanomam\u00f6 of the upper\nOrinoco in Venezuela will illustrate the heuristic value of Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s hypothesis\nfor the anthropological-linguistic \u2013 and thus pragmatic6 \u2013 analysis of ritualized types\nof verbal interaction. 90 Understanding pragmatics\n3.3.3 Little rituals: Requesting, giving and taking in the Eipo speech community\nIn 1974, an interdisciplinary team of German scholars started the project \u2018People,\nCulture and Environment in the Central Highlands of West New Guinea\u2019 in which\nthey carried out field research with the Eipo, a group of rather martial neolithic\nhorticulturists living in the valley of the Eipomek River in the highlands of West\nPapua, Indonesia.7 In 1981, Volker Heeschen, Wulf Schiefenh\u00f6vel and Iren\u00e4us Eibl-\nEibesfeldt published a survey on how the Eipo make requests and give and take gifts in\neveryday interaction and how they behave verbally and non-verbally in doing so. The\nsurvey pursues a human-ethological approach combined with anthropological-\nlinguistic aims of inquiry; it is based on the insight that the non-verbal acts \u2013 or \u2018little\nrituals\u2019 (Haviland 2009) \u2013 of requesting, giving and taking are \u2018essential in the bonding\nprocesses of a small community\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981: 140). The guiding hypotheses\nthat the authors wanted to verify (or falsify) in this article were\nthat nonverbal acts are not only prerequisites, necessary accompaniments, or\nsubstitutes of language proper, but that they are means of action in their own right ...\n[and] ... that for human beings in general it is advantageous to have at their disposal\ntwo channels of communication: the verbal and the nonverbal. Thus human beings\nare enabled to require, beg, approach, and make claims, which can be hostile acts or\nacts provoking repulsion and aggressivity, on the one channel, while maintaining the\nbonding process on the other.\n(Heeschen et al. 1981: 141)\nThe Eipo understand comments on things they possess as containing a demand to\nshare; therefore, such open comments on something precious must be avoided. People\nwill share voluntarily, according to their own decision. To share is a form of behaviour\nthat is taught to children and they learn it at an early phase in their childhood; sharing\nbehaviour pervades everyday life in the Eipo communities. This is the reason why the\nEipo proudly state \u2018nuun mako niinye gum \u2013 \u201cwe are no mean people\u201d\u2019 (Heeschen et al.\n1981: 146).8 Taking things away, however, is interpreted as an aggressive act; it is\nimmediately punished (see Heeschen et al. 1981: 153f.).\nThe descriptions of the Eipos\u2019 little rituals of requesting, giving and taking are based\non film documentations. In one such film the researchers make the following\nobservations: In front of a family hut a group of girls is sitting and standing close to\neach other. One of the girls, \u2018B\u2019, is sitting on a rock, holding a pandanus-fruit that\nconsists of hundreds of nuts. The girl picks the nuts, cracks them with her teeth, eats\nthem or gives them away to some of the girls in the group. \u2018B\u2019 had just given a nut to\n\u2018W\u2019. What follows is the minute description of what the researchers observed next:\n[A] little girl, X, of about three years of age is standing on the right side of W, watching\nB... and W cracking nuts. The distance between the bodies of W and X is only about 10\ncentimeters, but there is no skin contact. W turns her head and shoulders to the right,\nvery shortly ... glancing at K ..., about 13 years old, who stands at the right end of the\nrow [of girls]. Little X watching W crack the nut so close to her, raises both arms with Pragmatics and human ethology 91\nthe intention of reaching for the nut. The stretching out movement, however, is not\ncompleted. With hands and forearms having reached chest level, X draws them back to\nherself thus derouting the stretching out movement into one of self-embracing. X\ncontinues to watch W crack the nut. At the same time B ..., who has just loosened\nanother nut, turns her head and shoulders a little to the right and while cracking the\nnut between her teeth looks at K. With her head slightly oblique and under continuing\neye-contact she offers the just-opened nut to K ... K ... reacts to this offering gesture and\nstretches her left arm out to reach for the nut. Little X who is now the only one in the\ngroup without food turns her head and body towards K ... looking at her with wide-\nopen eyes. At this moment W who has just opened a nut and taken the contents out\ntouches X in the axilla-region. X did not react to her offering the nut some seconds ago.\nBeing touched, X turns back to W and takes the nut out of her hand. At this time all\nfour girls are eating.\n(Heeschen et al. 1981: 147f.)\nThe observed acts of requesting, giving and taking documented here were performed\nnon-verbally. The ethologists (Heeschen et al. 1981: 149ff.) annotate and interpret\nthese observations as follows: B and W are not close friends, because they do not\nremain in body contact with each other. Little X performs a derouted begging\nmovement. While she stretches out her arms to beg for a nut, she becomes aware of \u2018the\nrule that one should not snatch away things from someone else\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981:\n149). She deroutes her begging gesture and transforms it \u2013 in a form of displacement\nactivity \u2013 into a self-embrace. Self-embracing usually occurs in stressful situations\nwhere one cannot seek a hold on the body of another person, a behaviour which\n\u2018provides assurance, security and comfort\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981: 149). The older girls\ndo not demand greater shares, and the little girl begged just by \u2018looking, touching and\nproxemic shifts\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981: 151). In this way they allow B to either react to\ntheir appeals or to overlook them. The authors take these observations as evidence for\nthe fact that \u2018[n]onverbal behavior with its varieties in the sensory channels involved,\nand the subtle shades of its semantics, constitutes a well-structured system of\ncommunication in its own right\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981: 163).\nThe ethologists then describe an indirect verbal request directed by one man of\ninfluence to another man of status who is officially visiting his village. A makes this\nvisit because B hosts and cares for one of A\u2019s warriors who was severely wounded\nduring an ambush attack. After A had sat down on the village ground close to B, the\ntwo men started a conversation. After a while, B notices that A\u2019s bag is decorated\nwith bird of paradise feathers and \u2013 while both men have eye-contact with each\nother \u2013 B makes the remark: \u2018kwelib fotong teleb, \u201cnice feathers of the bird-of-\nparadise\u201d\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981: 151). Soon after, A bends down, unties one of the\nfeathers from his net and hands it over to B, who takes it and thanks A with a long\nsmile expressing his satisfaction. B takes the feather and attaches it to his bow \u2013 it is\nonly with this bird of paradise feather decoration that the Eipo consider a bow to be\ncomplete. The decoration called yin bata is highly valued, because birds of paradise\nare not found in the Eipomek valley. The ethologists interpret this little ritual\nexchange as follows: The fact that B was a leading man in his village and that he 92 Understanding pragmatics\ncared for A\u2019s wounded warrior put him in the position in which he could make his\nrequest for a feather. By giving B the feather A \u2013 being a big man himself \u2013 not only\nthanked him for taking responsibility for his wounded warrior but also obliged B to\nhimself (see Heeschen et al. 1981: 153).\nGifts can also relieve social tensions when groups of people meet in the Eipomek\nvalley. The ethologists observed that a group of people from another village entered\ntheir village of residence, approaching a group of local people. The foreigners were not\nwelcomed by greeting formulae, like \u2018yanmalam, \u201cyou are coming\u201d\u2019 (Heeschen et al.\n1981: 152). However, they greeted the villagers with eyebrow flashes (see 3.2.1 above);\nthen they halted at a distance from them and avoided any form of eye-contact. Silence\nand the absence of communicative behaviour can be interpreted as hostility. Tensions\nbetween groups that may occur in such encounters can be relieved \u2013 either by\nhumorous remarks, or by handing over small gifts, like some tobacco or a piece of\nsugar cane, to the guests, which helps breaking the silence between the parties. In the\ncase reported here the foreigners responded to this situation simply by going into the\nmen\u2019s house. There they started to exchange little gifts with their hosts who joined\nthem after a while. Then the bonding system started on the verbal and on the non-\nverbal level (see Heeschen et al. 1981: 152f.).\nDirect requests are interpreted by the Eipo as being close to an aggressive act.\nThey require immediate choice and answer and force the person to whom the\nrequest is directed to \u2018make up his [or her] mind in a minimum of time\u2019 (Heeschen\net al. 1981: 162).\nAnother form of requesting consists of combining childlike and submissive appeals\nwith verbal requests. These appeals may consist of \u2018lowering or heightening the voice\nand in prolonging the final vowel of the request\u2019 which can also be produced in a\n\u2018whimpering tone\u2019; moreover, the requests \u2018occur with stretching out of the hand and\nstroking the chin or beard of the potential giver or with intentions to this gesture\u2019\n(Heeschen et al. 1981: 156). These verbal requests combined with submissive, childlike\nand smiling behaviour can be repeated \u2013 they are generally observed with children\nand adolescents, but sometimes also with adults.\nIndirect requests in everyday interactions (Heeschen et al. 1981: 156f.) usually\ninvolve a \u2018slow proxemic shift\u2019 of the person who wants to get something towards the\npotential giver. Children and adolescents prefer to sit down so close to the giver that\nthey have skin contact. The person who wants to get something establishes eye-contact\nwith the giver and may breathe in some air which is then exhaled with the production\nof the sounds leklekana. These sounds are usually made when the Eipo eat hot spices\nor when they are smoking; they indicate pleasure and delight. Heeschen et al. point out\nthat these strategies are ambiguous and do not require a reaction of the person to\nwhom this behaviour is addressed; to clarify that one wants to make a request is to\ncombine these strategies with verbal statements like\nnaiye kwaning teleb, \u2018my friend (lit.: father), a good sweet potato\u2019, teleb tong; \u2018a good\nsmell\u2019, kwaning fatalonmanil, \u2018I have been lacking sweet potatoes\u2019, ... fatan wik, (I have)\na big hunger\u2019, or teleb dibmalam na mune gum se, \u2018you are eating well, I am hungry\u2019.\n(Heeschen et al. 1981: 157) Pragmatics and human ethology 93\nThese verbal utterances can be made at any time, but they usually follow the non-\nverbal contact opening behaviour patterns. It is now the addressees\u2019 turn to decide\nwhether they will react to these indirect non-verbal and verbal signals and give the\ndesired objects to the addressors. Contrary to direct requests, such indirect requests do\nnot force a decision to give upon their addressees, because \u2018the illocutionary force\u2019 of\nthe utterances in these indirect requests \u2018is more or less hidden\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981:\n157). The authors of this survey point out that these indirect forms of verbal and non-\nverbal behaviour are the best strategies for making successful requests, because:\n[t]hey all leave some time to the addressee of a request to choose among alternatives\nand to make up his mind ... the precise moment of handing over the object is up to his\ndecision ... Indirect requests and simple statements give the next speaking turn to the\naddressee. Thus, while the addressee takes the turn and takes part in structuring the\nbonding discourse around a topic he has, again, some time to make up his mind.\n(Heeschen et al. 1981: 163f.)\nThe most successful strategy for timing indirect requests was some time \u2018after a\nconversation had got on its way\u2019, because \u2018[o]nce the conversational bonding process\nhas been managed, the equilibrium can hardly be interrupted or disturbed by a\nrequest\u2019 (Heeschen et al. 1981: 158).\nThe study of the requesting, giving and taking behaviour of the Eipo has shown that\n\u2018conversational bonding, and, consequently, the onset of conversation are the best\nmeans to guarantee non-antagonizing requesting-giving-taking encounters\u2019\n(Heeschen et al. 1981: 163). With these insights this survey underlines Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s\nclaims with respect to the importance of group maintenance and bonding strategies in\nand for human social interaction.\n3.3.4 Forms of ritual communication: The palm fruit festival of the Yanomam\u00f6\nThe Yanomam\u00f6 (also known as Yanomami, Yanomama or Waika) are a group of\nindigenous people who live in the Amazon rainforest on the border between Venezuela\nand Brazil. Their language is called Yanomam\u00f6; other names are Yanomami, Yanomame,\nGuaica, Guaharibo and Guajaribo; the language is split into three dialects: Eastern\nYanomami (or Parima), Western Yanomami (or Padamo-Orinoco) and Cobari (or\nKobali, Cobariwa). Yanomami is spoken by about 11,000 people. The Yanomam\u00f6 are\nhunters and gatherers, fishers and horticulturists who cultivate among other things\nplantains \u2013 a kind of cooking banana \u2013 other bananas, manioc and sweet potatoes. They\nused to live in village communities in what looks like a large round communal house \u2013\nthe shabono \u2013 that actually consists of a series of individual houses under a single roof\nwith a central plaza; every family occupies a specific sector with its own fireplace within\nthis building that is open towards the village plaza. The Yanomam\u00f6 are famous because\nof the picturesque feathers and their body paintings with which they decorate themselves\nduring festivities. Their traditional weapons are bow-and-arrows and they use curare to\npoison their arrows. Till the end of the last century they were known in anthropological\ncircles as \u2018the fierce people\u2019 (Chagnon 1968) because of the chronic warfare in which they 94 Understanding pragmatics\nlived with their neighbours and because of the general violence that permeated their\neveryday life. Given this dominating role of war in their life, smaller villages could only\nsurvive if they managed to form alliances with other villages with which they entered\ninto mutual assistance pacts. Such assistance pacts were formed and reconfirmed during\nfestivals in which the guests received presents and were fed and entertained by their\nhosts. The festivals were usually celebrated when the Pijiguao palm fruit was ripe. In 1969\nEibl-Eibesfeldt documented and analysed such a palm fruit festival of the Yanomam\u00f6 of\nthe upper Orinoco. What follows is a summary of his report that was published in 1971\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1971a; see also Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1973b, 1989: 493 and 497ff.; and Eibl-\nEibesfeldt and Senft 1987: 119ff.).\nThe ethologist accompanied a group of men, women and children on a visit to a\nneighbouring village. All men carried their arms. Shortly before they entered their\nhosts\u2019 shabono the Yanomam\u00f6 decorated themselves. Men, women and children\npainted wave-like and circular ornaments on their bodies, some men painted their\nfaces black and put white feathers in their hair. Many men wore bracelets made of black\nfeathers on the upper arm in which they put white and red feathers of parrots to\nemphasize their strong muscles and broad shoulders. When they finished their\ndecoration, the chief sent one of his warriors into the village to announce the group\u2019s\narrival. Then the guests entered the shabono \u2013 one after the other, men first.\nEach of the male guests danced a circle on the village plaza with their feet stomping\na simple rhythm. The dancers turned left and right, showing themselves from all sides;\nsome of them stuck out their chests and held their heads high, giving them a somewhat\narrogant look. While the men danced, they made a few steps straight forward, then\nthey turned around stomping their feet. These powerful movements were accompanied\nby panting and puffing to emphasize the men\u2019s physical strength. The dancers carried\neither bows and arrows or palm branches, presenting their weapons or their leaves in\nvarious ways. Some dancers just carried one or two palm branches, lifting and putting\nthem down again. At times they put them on the ground and danced around them\nwith their hands up in the sky. Some dancers waved with their bow-and-arrow, even\noccasionally aiming at their hosts, but without bending the bow. These dancers were\nusually accompanied by children who waved with their palm branches while the\nwarriors danced.\nAfter the men had finished their dance display, a group of women started to dance\nwith the men and finally all the guests danced together around the plaza. Then the guests\nstopped dancing and visited their friends in the shabono, put up their hammocks in their\nhosts\u2019 living quarters and lay down to relax or started gossiping with their hosts.\nAfter a while, a small group of men started to take snuff, blowing a brownish matter\ncalled \u2018yopo\u2019 with sticks into each other\u2019s nostrils. When the drug showed its effect, the\nmen got up and started to dance, walking up and down and lifting their arms and\nimploring the help of spirits in their fights with their enemies. Thus intoxicated, the\nmen experienced feelings of high self-esteem. This dance \u2018unites the warriors in joint\naggression\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 497).\nLate in the afternoon the hosts also decorated themselves and danced for about half\nan hour in front of their guests, showing them the gifts which they would receive some\ntime later. Pragmatics and human ethology 95\nIn the meantime the hosts had cooked a banana soup which was eaten by all men.\nAfter this communal meal, the men started to dance around the plaza but under the\nroof of the shabono \u2013 brandishing bushknives, axes and arrows to expel malevolent\nspirits. After this dance the hosts and the guests came together to bewail their dead\nwith loud cries. Meanwhile, the hosts displayed the calabashes with the ashes of their\ndeceased loved ones. By now night had fallen. After the bewailing of the dead in\nanother demonstration of solidarity and unity, the men gathered in groups of two and\nstarted to sing so-called \u2018contract\u2019 songs. During this ceremony which is called\n\u2018uayamou\u2019, two men must crouch on the ground, face each other and confront each\nother with their needs and wishes. After a brief reciprocal speech, the communication\ndevelops into a more and more hectic form of ritual verbal recital that becomes\nincreasingly incomprehensible. At the end the singers just shout snatches of\nconversation at each other. Usually one man is singing sentences or words and the\nother answers after every utterance with an affirmative grunt or another such\nexpression. The contract songs express requests and intentions of gift giving. A Salesian\nmissionary translated the following excerpts from such a song for the human ethologist\n(unfortunately Eibl-Eibesfeldt does not provide the original texts in Western\nYanomami).9\nIn the song, a guest is interacting with his host. The guest starts and the host answers\nhim after every utterance with an affirmative grunt or another such expression:\n... I will speak. We are friends, I speak the truth. We are poor, because we live far away,\nyou are rich, because you live in the vicinity of the foreign mission. Here are the\nNapeyomas, the Salesian nuns, and ... the lay brother Iglesias. They give you many\nthings. We have nobody whom we could ask for things; but they give you machetes,\npots, hammocks, clothes, glass-beads ... (Pause) ...\n... To us Patanoueteri came the Pissasaiteri and they attacked us with bows and arrows.\nThey are very bad and evil. They killed one of our men and my wife. I am very sad and\nvery angry about that. You are a friend, get me a machete which you can get from the\nlay brother and pots which you can get from the nuns.\n... I have no dog and I am very angry because of that. You have many dogs. I need one\nto hunt tapirs. Therefore I make this request. Give me, I pay you, then I can hunt tapirs.\n... I do not want to leave this place because you are my friends. I remain in your houses in\nthe bush. Give me a dog, even if it is skinny, I will feed it and hunt tapirs with it. You have\nmany dogs, and you even have bitches who will get puppies, therefore give me a dog.\n... (Both men embrace each other and the host responds to his guest as follows:)\nI promise to give you a piece of tapir meat, because I have dogs to hunt other ones. Then\nyou can eat platano (bananas) with meat. Moreover, I will give you the dog, so that you\nlater can hunt and eat bananas, meat and Pijiguao (fruits).\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1971a: 771) 96 Understanding pragmatics\nThe host then requests to barter sticks and pieces of bamboo for making arrows. He\nexplains that he needs more arrows because of the many enemies they have. With\nadditional arrows they can unite with all their friends and fight against their enemies.\nThese contract songs may last up to half an hour; as mentioned above they change\ntheir character until just a hectic exchange of words is heard. The men end the contract\nsongs by producing the polite formula \u2018It was a good talk, it was a beautiful talk\u2019; then\nthey crawl back into their hammocks. Another man can get himself involved into such\na song and take it over. However, in general songs are started anew at another place\nwith another partner. This may go on all night long \u2013 and this is one of the important\nways in which personal relations of friendship are established and maintained.\nNext morning a group of men and women comes together to drink the ashes of the\ndeceased members of the shabono. Protected by a small number of warriors, the group\nis crouching around the shaman. The women hold calabashes with the ashes, they cry\nand sob and bewail the dead, singing songs like the following one: \u2018Oh my child, why\nhave you gone? Now I have nobody to decorate with colourful feathers\u2019. They look up\ninto the sky and lift their hands in despair. Then they give the calabashes with the\nashes to the shaman, who gets up, embraces the calabash and also starts to cry. In a\nsinging manner he calls to the deceased\u2019s spirit, however without addressing him or\nher by name. After a while he pours a portion of the ashes into a calabash full of\nbanana milk and hands it over to a warrior. All warriors receive such a portion of\nbanana milk with the ashes of the dead and drink it.\nAfter this ritualized bewailing of the dead some men gather at the central plaza and\nhave another snuff of yopo. Rather abruptly the group starts to move through the\nshabono, waving their weapons in the way they did the day before when they warded\noff malevolent spirits. Then the men meet in dyadic groups again and continue to sing\ncontract songs and embracing each other.\nIn the meantime, the women have put banana leaves on the ground of the plaza on\nwhich they had put baskets full of Pijiguao fruits, smoked monkeys, birds, armadillos\nand other such foodstuffs as presents for the guests. After the distribution of these gifts\nthe hosts request countergifts and receive pieces of cloth, pots and machetes. With\nthese gift distributions the palm fruit festival comes to its end.\nFrom an ethological point of view these complex forms of ritual communication are\nanalysed as follows: Feasts and festivals have an important group bonding function:\n\u2018As a binding rite the festival established and enforced friendly relations between hosts\nand guests\u2019 (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1971a: 777). Individuals and even village groups made\nfriends with each other, existing relationships were confirmed and maintained. The\ninteracting groups and individuals emphasized their peaceful intentions. However,\nwhen the male guests danced into their host\u2019s shabono introducing themselves, they\nperformed aggressive display behaviour which can easily provoke aggression. But this\nbehaviour was appeased by appeals by children and adults who did not wear arms but\ngreen palm branches (a symbol of peace in many cultures). Appeasing appeals with\nregard to children are also found in other cultures \u2013 children obviously manifest\nsignals to which adults react in a friendly way \u2013 thus they are perfect agents of\npeacemaking and bonding. One wonders, however, why the Yanomam\u00f6 warriors\nshow this aggressive display, given the fact that they are aware of the fact that what is Pragmatics and human ethology 97\nneeded is appeasement. It seems to be a general feature of contact situations that the\nparties involved boast and show off. During official state visits, politicians are greeted\nwith salutes and with rows of soldiers presenting their weapons. This form of self-\npresentation is probably intended to show one\u2019s fitness to fight and to point out that\none is \u2013 or could be \u2013 a valuable ally in conflicts. Even handshakes contain such a\ncomponent of boasting physical strength.\nCommunal meals constitute another important bonding ritual \u2013 offering food is a\nfriendly gesture in contact situations and helps to establish good relationships with\nothers; it has appeasing functions, too. The meals shared by both hosts and guests are\nan important ritual that enhances the bonding function of the social encounters\nduring the palm fruit festival. The same holds for a number of other rituals, like the\nexchange of gifts, the joint expelling of malevolent spirits, which demonstrates the\nreadiness of both hosts and guests to join each other in fighting a common enemy, and\nthe common mourning rituals, in which the mourners demonstrate that they are\nwilling to share each other\u2019s joys and sorrows in life. All these forms of behaviour\nreinforce the bond between visitors and hosts.\nThe conversations of the Yanomam\u00f6 that are ritualized into antiphonies are of\nspecial interest. The principle \u2018you give me something, I give you something\u2019 is\nconstitutive for these contract songs. In the example mentioned above the guest\nstarts his song by pointing out how poor his life is in comparison to that of his host\nwho can rely on support by the mission. The guest then informs his host about his\nrecent calamities and his sorrow caused by attacking enemies who killed his wife.\nWith this sad news he elicits sympathy in the host. The guest is seeking pity and\ncompassion to check whether he is synchronized with his host. If this is the case, the\ninteractants have established a general feeling of harmony between each other which\nconstitutes the basis for a successful contract song. On this common basis, created\nduring these first moments of an encounter, interactants realize that they are willing\nto understand each other in the conversation to follow. The developing conversation\nis gradually ritualized into antiphonies that provide a special frame for making\nrequests which may otherwise be too direct, impolite and embarrassing and it offers\nthe receiver of these requests a forum in which he can show his generosity and his\nwillingness to keep up his friendship with his partner in the contract song. The fact\nthat at the end of these contract songs the antiphonies change into unintelligible but\ncoordinately alternating fragmentary verbal utterances indicates that this specific\nform of communication at this phase of the interaction no longer conveys any\ninformation of whatever kind; it now just signals harmony, synchrony and a strong\nfriendly bond between the singers. The success of the song presented above is\ndemonstrated by the partners\u2019 embrace, by the hosts\u2019 gifts and by the guests\u2019\nreadiness to engage with them in barter. Thus, the contract songs during the palm\nfruit festival constitute an important bonding ritual that is existential for the survival\nof smaller village groups in a general atmosphere of violence and aggression created\nby the chronic warfare in which they lived with their neighbours.\nThis festival \u2013 like many other rituals of friendly encounter (like, for example,\ncomplex greeting rituals) \u2013 is structured in the following way (see also Eibl-Eibesfeldt\n1989: 498): 98 Understanding pragmatics\nFirst there is an opening phase with a strong greeting component. In this phase,\nwhich constitutes the opening of friendly contact without components of submission,\nwe observe rituals of self-presentation, of bonding and of appeasement as well as\naggressive display behaviour combined with appeasing appeals that function as signals\nof peacemaking and bonding.\nThen there is a phase of reinforcing bonding which serves as a basis for factual\ncontracts. In this phase we observe avowals of mutual sympathy and harmony in\nverbal interactions and solidarity expressed in communal actions, joint meals and\ndances as well as communal mourning and staged fighting behaviour.\nFinally, there is a phase of bidding farewell which contributes to securing the established\nand reinforced bonds. In this phase we observe the exchange of gifts, good wishes for the\nfuture and the affirmation of mutual trust, consent, agreement and continuing solidarity.\nThis analysis of the complex forms of ritual communication that are enacted during\nthe palm fruit festival of the Yanomam\u00f6 illustrates the explanatory power of human-\nethological concepts and insight with regard to pragmatic analyses of verbal and non-\nverbal behaviour in forms of ritual communication in social interactions.\n3.3.5 The human \u2018interaction engine\u2019\nIn 2006 Stephen Levinson presented his human \u2018interaction engine\u2019 hypothesis; he\nclaimed that:\nthe roots of human sociality lie in a special capacity for social interaction, which itself\nholds the key to human evolution, the evolution of language, the nature of much of our\ndaily concerns, the building blocks of social systems, and even the limitations of our\npolitical systems.\n(Levinson 2006: 39)\nHe supported this claim of the (at least partial) independence of human interactional\nabilities from language and culture by pointing out:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that we can interact without language simply by using \u2018mime and gesture\u2019 even in\nfirst contact situations (see Connolly and Anderson 1987),\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that infants interact with each other \u2018long before they speak\u2019,\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that interaction does not disappear when language is lost,\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that there \u2018is some evidence for a distinct \u201csocial intelligence\u201d ... from inherited\ndeficits and neurological case studies\u2019,\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that speakers can switch languages \u2018midstream in interaction ... leaving the\ninteractional framework undisturbed\u2019,\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that ethnographic research reveals a \u2018cultural shaping of all the modalities of interaction\u2019,\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that cross-linguistic and cross-cultural research on the structure of conversations\nindicate that there is a \u2018shared universal framework for verbal interaction\u2019, and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that contrary to other primates humans invest a large \u2018amount of time and effort ...\nin interaction\u2019.\n(see Levinson 2006: 40ff.) Pragmatics and human ethology 99\nOn the basis of these observations Levinson put forward\nthe proposal that, from an ethological point of view, humans have a distinctive, pan-\nspecific pattern of interaction with conspecifics, marked by (1) intensity and duration,\n(2) specific structural properties, and (3) those properties separable from the language\nwith which it is normally conducted.\n(Levinson 2006: 42)\nFor Levinson \u2013 who explicitly takes an ethological point of view at the start of his\ndeveloping argument \u2013 interaction has absolute priority over language (which is only\nlater integrated into the interaction engine in language- and culture-specific ways). He\nargues that \u2018humans did not evolve language, then get involved in a special kind of\nsocial life ... [L]anguage must have evolved for something for which there was already\na need \u2013 that is, for communication in interaction\u2019 (Levinson 2006: 42; see also 53f.).\nBy excluding the observed diversity of languages and cultures, Levinson joins the\nhuman ethologists\u2019 universalist position in claiming that \u2018there has to be some\npowerful meaning-making machinery that we all share\u2019. With this position he comes\nclose to Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s claim quoted above that despite the huge variety of human\nforms of interactive behaviours they can all be reduced to a limited number of universal\nand elementary human social interaction strategies (see Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989: 522).\nLevinson\u2019s discussion of cultural variation in forms of human interaction seems to\nmirror this ethological claim:\nThis idea \u2013 that the local, cultural specialization is a variation of a universal theme \u2013 is\npotentially powerful, because as we learn more about conversational organization we\nsee that there are relatively few, crucial organization principles.\n(Levinson 2006: 61)\nHowever, Levinson also combines ethological claims and insights with findings in\nanthropology, in linguistics, especially in Conversation Analysis (see subsection 5.4\nbelow), and in other cognitive sciences when he presents his idea \u2018in a nutshell\u2019:\n[H]umans are natively endowed with a set of cognitive abilities and behavioral\ndispositions that synergistically work together to endow human face-to-face interaction\nwith certain special qualities. I call these elements collectively the human interaction\nengine (which is meant to suggest both dedicated mental machinery and motive power,\ni.e., both \u201csavvy\u201d and \u201coomph\u201d) ... What I am entertaining is that there are underlying\nuniversal properties of human interaction that can be thought of as having a cognitive-\nand-ethological foundation.\n(Levinson 2006: 44)\nThis \u2018interaction engine\u2019 makes it possible to interpret and even predict the behaviour\nof others and thus allows interactants to attribute intentions to their respective\ninterlocutors. It allows \u2018us to simulate the other simulating us\u2019, and to recognize and\nunderstand intentions (Levinson 2006: 54). This is one of the crucial prerequisites for 100 Understanding pragmatics\ncooperative interaction (see Clark 1996a: 191ff.). However, Levinson (2006: 56)\nemphasizes that \u2018the interaction engine is not to be understood as an invariant, a fixed\nmachine with fixed output, but as a set of principles that can interdigitate with local\nprinciples, to generate different local flavors\u2019.\nThus, this set of basic organizing principles \u2018provides the building blocks for cultural\ndiversity in social interaction ... it provides the parameters for variation with default\nvalues that account for the surprising commonalities in the patterns of informal\ninterchange across cultures\u2019.\nPut differently, the enormous variety of human interaction observed in different\ncultures can be attributed to and explained by a few organizing principles. Levinson\u2019s\nidea that a \u2018core interaction engine [drives] human social life\u2019 (Levinson 2006: 62) is\ncertainly a daring, but also an extremely interesting and fascinating hypothesis with\nimportant consequences for linguistic pragmatics (and semantics). However, like Eibl-\nEibesfeldt\u2019s claim for universal human interaction strategies, Levinson\u2019s interaction\nengine hypothesis requires a vast amount of empirical and comparative research to be\nverified \u2013 or falsified (see Senft 2009b: 99). Nevertheless, both these hypotheses\nhighlight the fact that the study of language use is a transdisciplinary enterprise that\nmust be guided by the insight that language use is just a part \u2013 although a very\nimportant one \u2013 of human interaction which is fundamentally multimodal in nature.\n3.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis chapter introduced the human-ethological concept of expressive movements that\nare differentiated in such a way that they function as communicative signals. These\nsignals are very important for social interaction because they allow one to make\npredictions about an individual\u2019s disposition and her or his intentions and actions. A\nspecial form of these signals are facial expressions which have been researched ever\nsince Darwin and his contemporaries. The claim of Ekman and his colleagues, who\nargue \u2013 in Darwin\u2019s tradition \u2013 that there are universal facial expressions of emotions\nthat are recognized in every culture and expressed with the same emotional terms in\nall languages was rejected on ethological, anthropological and linguistic grounds.\nHowever, Ekman\u2019s research has resulted in the development of a tool for describing\nfacial muscle motions and has turned out to be extremely useful for researching facial\nexpressions like the eyebrow flash. After a description of the various functions of this\neyebrow raising it was shown that its form was almost identical in different cultures;\nmoreover, in these cultures this signal communicates first and foremost a person\u2019s\nopenness for social contact. Besides facial expressions we also send communicative\nand interactional signals with our territorial behaviour which is expressed in personal\ndistances and forms of positional behaviour. Being aware of the fact that facial\nexpressions are important signals in face-to-face communication, that there are\nculture-specific needs to maintain distance in interactions and that interactants signal\ntheir readiness (or unwillingness) to open their group to a third party are important\naspects for understanding communicative behaviour and culturally appropriate forms\nof language use. Realizing the importance of these ritualized and culture-specific Pragmatics and human ethology 101\nforms of expressive behaviour that frame the situative context of verbal interactions is\nnecessary to be able to adequately engage and participate in such interactions.\nFamiliarity with these forms of ritualized behaviour patterns is the prerequisite for\ngetting access to a group of interlocutors engaged in conversation and for establishing\nand maintaining a bond that guarantees the possibility of further interaction with\nmembers of this speech community. After a general discussion of ritual and the\nprocess of ritualization in which expressive movements are developed into\ncommunicative interactional signals, the concept of \u2018ritual communication\u2019 was\ndefined as \u2018artful, performed semiosis, predominantly but not only involving speech,\nthat is formulaic and repetitive and therefore anticipated within particular contexts of\nsocial interaction\u2019 (Basso and Senft 2009: 1). It was pointed out that human ethologists\nlike Eibl-Eibesfeldt trace rituals and ritual communication back to a finite set of\nuniversal interaction strategies. Interaction strategies in ritual communication were\nillustrated with the results of a study of the \u2018little\u2019 rituals constituted by the requesting,\ngiving and taking behaviour of the Eipo and with an analysis of the complex palm fruit\nfestival of the Yanomam\u00f6; it was shown that the previously introduced human-\nethological concept of interaction strategies provides additional strength to pragmatic\nanalyses of verbal \u2013 and non-verbal \u2013 behaviour in social interactions. The chapter\nended with a brief sketch of Levinson\u2019s idea of a human \u2018interaction engine\u2019 that\nconsists of a set of basic principles which organize human interaction and drive social\nlife. Levinson argues that the enormous variety of forms of human interaction in\ndifferent cultures can be attributed to and explained by a few of these principles. The\nhypothesis about the existence of universal interaction strategies as well as the\ninteraction engine hypothesis are extremely interesting and fascinating, however,\nmuch research is needed to verify or falsify them. Nevertheless, these hypotheses\nemphasize that the study of language use is a transdisciplinary enterprise guided by\nthe insight that human interaction is fundamentally multimodal.\nWhat does this chapter tell us about the anecdote reported in the introduction to\nthis volume? It reveals that I was unable to read the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 body language\nwhich signalled that more was at issue when they greeted me with the question \u2018Where\ndo you go\u2019? Their greeting was always accompanied by an eyebrow flash, a greeting\nwhich I returned (the eyebrow flash as a form of greeting is ubiquitous on the\nTrobriands), but \u2013 being unaware of the complexity of this greeting ritual as a socially\nimportant bonding and bond-reinforcing form of ritual communication I did not\nproperly respond to this offer for a brief verbal interaction in which I was meant to\nanswer the question in a proper way. I just naively and in a rather ethnocentric way\ninterpreted this culture-specific form of greeting as being equivalent to a casual\nWestern form of greeting like \u2018Hello\u2019 or \u2018Hi\u2019.\n3.5 EXERCISE/WORK SECTION\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Discuss and explain the function of (at least six) expressive movements in your\nculture that have developed into signals in processes of phylogenetic and cultural\nritualization. 102 Understanding pragmatics\n(cid:120)(cid:3) What are your assumptions about which complex behaviour patterns are involved\nin expressing the emotions \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018anger\u2019, \u2018happiness\u2019 and \u2018sadness\u2019 and what is the\ncommunicative function of these expressive patterns?\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Let one of your friends videotape you at a party or a meeting in which you do not\nrespect the norms of personal distance that are valid in your culture.

A look at the\nhistory of anthropological linguistics from the days of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u2013\n1803) and Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835) to the present reveals that these\ndisciplines have always been very close to each other (see Senft 2009c). This chapter\ndeals with the interrelationship of language, culture and cognition.\nOne of the anthropologists whose linguistic insights became extremely influential\nin pragmatics was Bronislaw Malinowski (1884\u20131942). The first part of this chapter\npresents his ideas about context and meaning and his concept of \u2018phatic communion\u2019\nwhich he developed during his field research on the Trobriand Islands in Papua New\nGuinea. Malinowski\u2019s concept of phatic communion is critically assessed and\nillustrated with phatic expressions in Korean.\nThen \u2013 in connection with Edward Sapir\u2019s (1884\u20131939) and Benjamin Lee Whorf\u2019s\n(1897\u20131941) linguistic relativity hypothesis \u2013 the interrelationship of language, culture\nand cognition will be further discussed and illustrated with cross-cultural research on\nconceptions of space and frames of spatial reference in various languages.\nThe third part of this chapter on the influence of ethnology on pragmatics presents\na discussion of Dell Hymes\u2019s (1927\u20132009) and John Gumperz\u2019s (1922\u20132013)\nethnography of speaking paradigm with illustrations from Joel Sherzer\u2019s research on\nthe Kuna Ways of Speaking.\n4.2 PHATIC COMMUNION\nBronislaw Malinowski is generally recognized as one of the founders of social\nanthropology, transforming nineteenth century speculative anthropology into a field-\noriented science that is based on empirical research. Malinowski is principally\nassociated with his field research on the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 culture. However, he\nmust also be mentioned as one of the apologists, pioneers and founding fathers of\nanthropological linguistics as a discipline in its own right.1 As early as 1920 he made\nthe claim that \u2018linguistics without ethnography would fare as badly as ethnography\nwithout the light thrown in it by language\u2019 (Malinowski 1920: 78).2 Pragmatics and ethnology 105\nMalinowski became interested in linguistics when he found that he could not realize\nhis project of writing a grammar of Kilivila because he had no linguistic training and\nbecause he was convinced that the grammatical categories offered by the linguistic\ntheories of his time did not fit for the description of a language like Kilivila (Malinowski\n1920: 74). In 1920 he explicitly stated the following:\nthere is an urgent need for an Ethno-linguistic theory, a theory for the guidance of\nlinguistic research to be done among natives and in connexion with ethnographic\nstudy\u2026 A theory which, moreover, aims not at hypothetical constructions \u2013\n\u2018origins\u2019, \u2018historical developments\u2019, \u2018cultural transferences\u2019, and similar speculations\n\u2013 but a theory concerned with the intrinsic relation of facts. A theory which in\nlinguistics would show us what is essential in language and what therefore must\nremain the same throughout the whole range of linguistic varieties; how linguistic\nforms are influenced by physiological, mental, social, and other cultural elements;\nwhat is the real nature of Meaning and Form, and how they correspond; a theory\nwhich, in fine, would give us a set of well-founded plastic definitions of grammatical\nconcepts.\n(Malinowski 1920: 69)\nMalinowski\u2019s linguistic interests \u2018centered on language as a mode of behavior and on\nproblems of culturally determined meaning\u2019 (M\u00e9traux 1968: 524). He developed his\nethnographic theory of language mainly in connection with his attempts to translate\nthe Trobriand Islanders\u2019 magical formulae. Malinowski realized that the Trobriand\nIslanders believed in the power of the words in the magical formulae: they used these\nformulae to reach certain aims with the firm conviction that they could thus influence\nand control nature and the course of, and events in, their lives. Thus, in the domain of\nmagic language is doing something, it has certain effects, it has power and force.\nMalinowski (1922: 432) summarized this observation as follows: \u2018Magic is \u2026 an\ninstrument serving special purposes, intended for the exercise of man\u2019s specific power\nover things, and its meaning ... can be understood only in correlation to this aim\u2019. For\nhim \u2018it is the use of words which invoke, state, or command the desired aim\u2019\n(Malinowski 1974: 74). Thus, Malinowski explicitly equates meaning with pragmatic\nfunction. He characterized his \u2013 pragmatic \u2013 theory of meaning as a theory that insists\non the\nlinking up of ethnographic descriptions with linguistic analysis which provides\nlanguage with its cultural context and culture with its linguistic interpretation. Within\nthis latter \u2026 [I have] \u2026 continually striven to link up grammar with the context of\nsituation and with the context of culture.\n(Malinowski 1935: 73)\nFor Malinowski (as well as for Wittgenstein, by the way) the meaning of a word lies in\nits use. Thus, to study meaning one cannot examine isolated words but one must\nconsider sentences or utterances in their situative context: \u2018the real understanding of\nwords is always ultimately derived from active experience of those aspects of reality to 106 Understanding pragmatics\nwhich the words belong\u2019 (Malinowski 1935: 58). For Malinowski \u2018the real linguistic\nfact is the full utterance within its context of situation\u2019 (Malinowski 1935: 11). Thus,\nmeaning is function within context.3 This \u2018context theory\u2019 of meaning is based on a\nrather broad definition of the concept of context: Malinowski points out\nthat it is very profitable in linguistics to widen the concept of context so that it embraces\nnot only spoken words but facial expression, gesture, bodily activities, the whole group\nof people present during an exchange of utterances and the part of the environment in\nwhich these people are engaged.\n(Malinowski 1935 vol. II: 22; see also pp. 26, 30, 40)\nMalinowski (1936: 296, 309ff.) illustrates how the meaning of utterances can be\ndetermined in what he calls \u2018the essential primitive uses of speech: speech in action,\nritual handling of words, the narrative, \u201cphatic communion\u201d (speech in social\nintercourse)\u2019.4 The last of these four types of language use which are fundamental for\nMalinowski needs some brief comments. Discussing language used in what he calls\n\u2018free, aimless social intercourse\u2019, like greeting formulae, passing inquiries about\nsomeone\u2019s health, comments on the weather, and comments on what is obvious\nMalinowski points out the following:\nto a natural man another man\u2019s silence is not a reassuring factor, but on the contrary,\nsomething alarming and dangerous ... The breaking of silence, the communion of\nwords is the first act to establish links of fellowship, which is consummated only by the\nbreaking of bread and the communion of food. The modern English expression, \u2018Nice\nday to-day\u2019 or the Melanesian phrase \u2018Whence comest thou?\u2019 are needed to get over the\nstrange unpleasant tension which men feel when facing each other in silence.\nAfter the first formula, there comes a flow of language, purpose-less expressions of\npreference or aversion, accounts of irrelevant happenings, comments on what is\nperfectly obvious ...\nThere can be no doubt that we have a new type of linguistic use \u2013 phatic communion\nI am tempted to call it \u2026 \u2013 a type of speech in which ties of union are created by a mere\nexchange of words. ... Are words in Phatic Communion used primarily to convey\nmeaning, the meaning which is symbolically theirs? Certainly not! They fulfil a social\nfunction and that is their principal aim, they are neither the result of intellectual\nreflection, nor do they necessarily arouse reflection in the listener. ... Each utterance is\nan act serving the direct aim of binding hearer to speaker by a tie of some social\nsentiment or other. Once more, language appears to us in this function not as an\ninstrument of reflection but as a mode of action ...\n... \u2018phatic communion\u2019 serves to establish bonds of personal union between people\nbrought together by the mere need of companionship and does not serve any purpose\nof communicating ideas.\n(Malinowski 1936: 313ff.)\nAfter this definition of the concept \u2018phatic communion\u2019 he emphasizes again his main\nposition with respect to language: Pragmatics and ethnology 107\n[L]anguage in its primitive function and original form has an essentially pragmatic\ncharacter; ... it is a mode of behaviour, an indispensable element of concerted human\naction ... to regard it as a means for the embodiment or expression of thought is to take\na one-sided view of one of its most derivate and specialized functions.\n(Malinowski 1936: 316)5\nMalinowski\u2019s concept of \u2018phatic (from Greek phatos, \u2018spoken\u2019) communion\u2019 highlights\nthe \u2018bonding function\u2019 of language. Konrad Ehlich (1993: 317) interprets Malinowski\u2019s\nuse of the word \u2018communion\u2019 with its religious connotation as a means for emphasizing\nthe intensity of this type of speech. Malinowski\u2019s concept was borrowed and slightly\nmodified by Roman Jakobson (1960) in his expansion of Karl B\u00fchler\u2019s (1934) organon\nmodel of language to refer \u2018to that function of language which is channel-oriented in\nthat it contributes to the establishment and maintenance of communicative contact\u2019\n(Lyons 1977: 53f.). It is quite likely that, because of Jakobson\u2019s influential article, most\nlinguists and anthropologists nowadays refer to Malinowski\u2019s concept with the\ntechnical term \u2018phatic communication\u2019. However, the term \u2018phatic communication\u2019 is\nnot synonymous with the term \u2018phatic communion\u2019. As Adam Kendon (p.c.) points\nout, the term \u2018phatic communication\u2019 is probably used because people tend to forget\nthe more general meaning of the term \u2018communion\u2019; it is precisely that achievement of\n\u2018rapport\u2019 through the use of speech \u2013 a kind of communion, indeed \u2013 that Malinowski\nemphasized, and this is different from what is often thought to be the meaning of\n\u2018communication\u2019.\nTo summarize, the term phatic communion is generally used to refer to utterances\nthat are said to have exclusively social bonding functions like establishing and\nmaintaining a friendly and harmonious atmosphere in interpersonal relations,\nespecially during the opening and closing stages of social encounters.\nDesmond Morris (1978: 82) described phatic communion as \u2018grooming talk\u2019 (see\nalso subsection 3.3.2); this grooming-like function of phatic communion is central to\nRobin Dunbar\u2019s theory on the origin of language. Dunbar proposes that\nlanguage evolved to service social bonds in a more generic sense by providing a\nsubstitute for social grooming, the main mechanism that our fellow primates use for\nbonding social relationships ... For humans, as with all primates, effectively bonded\nsocial groups are essential for successful survival and reproduction, and since\ngrooming has a natural limit on the size of group that can be bonded by it, language\nwas necessary to break through this glass ceiling and allow larger groups to evolve.\n(Dunbar 2009: 14; see also 1993)\nIt is obvious that Malinowski heavily emphasizes the bonding function of phatic\ncommunion. In his definition of the concept he explicitly mentioned \u2018the Melanesian\nphrase \u201cWhence comest thou?\u201d\u2019 (Malinowski: 1936: 314) as a prototypical example for\nphatic communion. The anecdote reported at the very beginning of this volume\ntopicalizes exactly this greeting behaviour of the Trobriand Islanders. However, it\nshows that this Melanesian phrase conveys more than just the social function of\ncreating a bond between speaker and addressee; as a binding ritual it certainly signals 108 Understanding pragmatics\nsecurity within the whole social network of the community in which this greeting\nformula is used, but it may also initiate exchanges that can be rather rich in information.\nThere is thus often more behind an utterance which is said to serve only a phatic\nfunction. This observation also holds for a number of studies that explicitly deal with\nthe concept of phatic communion. Thus, in his anthology Conversational Routine we\nfind a contribution by Florian Coulmas on Japanese in which he emphasizes that\nalthough \u2018most apologies observed in everyday interaction\u2019 seem to be \u2018desubstantialized\nroutines with no semantic content, merely functioning as means of \u201cphatic\ncommunion\u201d\u2019 the situation is more complex: \u2018the functionally similar employment of\napology and gratitude expressions must be seen as a significant reflection of social\nvalues and attitudes prevailing in Japanese culture\u2019 (Coulmas 1981: 87).\nIn the same volume, John Laver points out that the \u2018linguistic behavior of\nconversational routines, including greetings and partings, as well as please, thanks,\nexcuses, apologies and small talk, is part of the linguistic repertoire of politeness\u2019\n(Laver 1981: 290). Discussing utterances of phatic communion, he finds that besides\nthe two social functions already mentioned by Malinowski \u2013 that is to \u2018defuse the\npotential hostility of silence\u2019 and to allow participants in a social verbal encounter \u2018to\ncooperate in getting the interaction comfortably under way\u2019 \u2013 these linguistic routines\nalso have a third and probably more important function in the initial phase of\nconversation: \u2018phatic communion \u2026 allows the participants to feel their way towards\nthe working consensus of their interaction \u2026 partly revealing their perception and\ntheir relative social status\u2019 (Laver 1981: 301).\nIn an earlier, and most important paper for the discussion of Malinowski\u2019s concept,\nLaver (1975: 217) elaborates on all \u2018communicative functions of phatic communion\u2019 in\ndetail \u2013 based on data from English-speaking cultures. In this paper, he first points out\nthat \u2018the fundamental function of the \u2026 communicative behavior that accompanies\nand includes phatic communion is the detailed management of interpersonal\nrelationships during the psychologically crucial margins of interactions\u2019. This\ncommunicative behaviour includes \u2018posture, body orientations, gesture, facial\nexpression and eye contacts\u2019 and is more than \u2018a mere exchange of words\u2019 as Malinowski\ndescribed it (Laver 1975: 232). Laver then describes and analyses the functions of\nutterances and other communicative forms of behaviour that are claimed to represent\nphatic communion in the opening and closing phases of interaction, especially with\nrespect to the transition phases from \u2018noninteraction to full interaction\u2019 \u2013 in which\nphatic communion establishes contact between the interactants \u2013 and from \u2018interaction\nback to noninteraction\u2019 \u2013 in which phatic communion achieves a cooperative parting\nand helps secure the established bonds between the interactants (Laver 1975: 232).6 In\nthe opening phase of an interaction Laver (1975: 223) differentiates three different\n\u2018tokens\u2019 with which phatic communion is initiated: neutral tokens, like a description\n(\u2018Terrible night last night\u2019) or talking about the weather (\u2018Nice day\u2019), self-oriented\ntokens usually in the form of declarative statements (\u2018Hot work this\u2019) and other-\noriented tokens usually presented as questions (\u2018Do you come here often?\u2019). In the\nopening phase of an interaction, phatic communion has the function \u2018to lubricate the\ntransition from noninteraction to interaction, and to ease the potentially awkward\ntension of the early moments of the encounter, \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d, so to speak\u2019 (Laver Pragmatics and ethnology 109\n1975: 218). Laver claims that the choice of the tokens used \u2018establish and consolidate the\ninterpersonal relationship between ... participants\u2019 in terms of status and solidarity\n(Laver 1975: 236). In the closing phase of an interaction, Laver (1975: 230) argues,\nphatic communion has the function of \u2018assuaging the noninitiating participant\u2019 (\u2018I\u2019m\nsorry, I have to go\u2019) and to consolidate \u2018the relationship between the ... interactants\u2019\n(\u2018Take care, now\u2019).\nLaver points out that \u2018[s]kill in managing the behavioral resources of phatic\ncommunion ... [is] ... a very basic skill essential to a major part of the psychosocial\ntransactions that make up daily life\u2019 (Laver 1975: 233). He summarizes his discussion\nof phatic communion as follows:\n[P]hatic communion is a complex part of a ritual, highly skilled mosaic of\ncommunicative behavior whose function is to facilitate the management of\ninterpersonal relationships. The information exchanged between the participants in\nthis communicative process is not primarily referential information, but rather is\nindexical information about aspects of the participants\u2019 social identity relevant to\nstructuring the interactional consensus of the present and future encounters. The\nfunction of phatic communion thus goes beyond the creation, in Malinowski\u2019s phrase,\nof \u2018ties of union\u2019: it certainly does serve to establish such broad ties in that the tokens of\nphatic communion are tokens exchanged in the ritual transactions of psychosocial\nacceptance, but it also provides the participants with a subtle tool for use in staking\nindexical claims which shape and constrain their detailed relationship in the crucial\nmarginal phases of encounters when their psychological comfort is most at risk.\n(Laver 1975: 236)\nIn what follows the concept of phatic communion is further illustrated with examples\nfrom Korean.\nDuk-Soo Park (2006: 156\u2013162) presents the phatic expressions quoted below which\nare used in opening and closing phases of Korean conversations. He differentiates\nbetween greetings used in the conversation opening phase, flattering, humble and\nneutral expressions used in the opening or in the medial phase of conversation and\nexpressions used in the closing phase of a conversation. Park\u2019s examples (1) and (2) are\nKorean greetings:\n(1) Yoy\u016dm sa\u014fb-\u016dn chal toe-sijiyo?\n\u2018Is your business doing well these days?\u2019\nNe, t\u014fkpun-e (chal toe-mnida).\n\u2018Yes (it is), thanks to you.\u2019\nGreetings like this elicit positive responses; Park points out that the worst response one\ncould get after greeting people by inquiring after their or their family\u2019s well-being or\nafter their business will be k\u016dj\u014f k\u016draeyo \u2018so-so\u2019.\n(2) (cid:430)di ka-seyo?\nlit., \u2018Are you going somewhere?\u2019 110 Understanding pragmatics\nNe, \u014fdi ka-yo. (cid:430)di ka-seyo?\nlit., \u2018Yes, I am. Are you going somewhere?\u2019\nThis form of greeting is similar to the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 greeting \u2018Ambe?\u2019, however,\nthe Korean question has a completely different function than the Melanesian phrase\n\u2018Whence comest thou?\u2019. Park points out that the greeting\n\u014fdi ka-seyo? \u2018Hi!\u2019 (lit., Are you going somewhere?) often creates a great deal of confusion for\nforeigners. Since \u014fdi can be \u2018where\u2019 as well as \u2018somewhere\u2019, it can be interpreted as \u2018Where\nare you going?\u2019 I personally have encountered many foreigners, who had been in Korea for\na considerable length of time, wondering why Koreans are so keen to know other people\u2019s\ndestinations when they meet on the street. Obviously, it is a misunderstanding of the\nutterance: Koreans do not ask for your destination by saying \u2018Hi!\u2019 and even if we are allowed\nto interpret the utterance literally, it is a yes-or-no question, not a WH-question. What you\nhave to say in response is ne, \u014fdi ka-yo \u2018Yes, I am going somewhere\u2019, ne, \u014fdi ka-seyo \u2018Yes (I\nam), are you going somewhere?\u2019 or even ne, anny\u014fngha-seyo? \u2018Yes, I am, how are you?\u2019\n(Park 2006: 157)\nPark\u2019s example (3) presents \u2018a fixed, foolproof ritual of phatic communion ... strangers\nshould follow ... in a formal business setting\u2019:\n(3) A: Ch\u2019\u014f\u016dm poep-kess\u016dmnida. Ch\u014f-n\u016dn KBS-\u016di A i-mnida.\n\u2018Nice to meet you. (lit., I see you for the first time). I am A from KBS.\u2019\nB: Ne, ch\u2019\u014f\u016dm poep-kess\u016dmnida. MBC-\u016di B i-mnida.\n\u2018Nice to meet you. I am B from MBC.\u2019\nA: Chal put\u2019ak t\u016dri-mnida.\n\u2018I request your guidance.\u2019\nB: W\u014fn py\u014fl malss\u016dm-\u016dl (ta ha-simnida). Che-ga put\u2019ak t\u016dry-\u014fyajo.\n\u2018 You shouldn\u2019t have said that. I am the one who should ask for your\nguidance.\u2019\nPark points out that the verbal frame of this ritualized phatic formula is more or less\nmeaningless, what matters in such an encounter are the names of the persons and the\nnames of the companies represented by the interactants.\nPark\u2019s example (4) presents a flattering expression which makes use of \u2018elevated\nother-oriented tokens such as the listeners themselves, or their children, property or\nfood\u2019. These compliments are made when people visit each other.\n(4) Ch\u014fg\u014fdo sim-ny\u014fn-\u016dn ch\u014flm-\u014f poi-simnida.\n\u2018You look at least ten years younger.\u2019\nPark\u2019s example (5) illustrates the ritual a Korean speaker follows when one gives and\nreceives a gift:\n(5) A: Ig\u014f py\u014flg\u014f ani-jiman pad-a chu-seyo.\n\u2018This is nothing special, but please accept it from me.\u2019 Pragmatics and ethnology 111\nB: W\u014fn py\u014fl k\u014f-l ta kajy-\u014f o-sy\u014fss\u016dmnida.

(lit., You even brought something\nspecial) Then, although it is shameless of me, I will accept it.\u2019\nA presents the gift with the \u2018humble self-oriented token\u2019 \u2013 \u2018nothing special\u2019 \u2013 while B finally\naccepts the gift; the reference to this \u2018shameless behaviour\u2019 represents \u2018a humble self-oriented\ntoken\u2019. Park points out that Koreans do not thank for being praised or being offered a gift\nimmediately after they hear the praise or get the gift. It is considered impolite to accept\ncompliments and offers right away. In these cases Koreans say \u2018not at all\u2019 instead of \u2018thank you\u2019\n(komap-s\u016dmnida). Similarly, \u2018when they are invited for a party, they would say \u2018You don\u2019t have\nto do that, since you must be busy ...\u2019. This is illustrated in Park\u2019s examples (6) and (7):\n(6) A: Chib-i ch\u2019am k\u2019\u016d-go cho-ss\u016dmnida.\n\u2018Your house is very big and nice.\u2019\nB: W\u014fn py\u014fl malss\u016dm-\u016dl ta ha-simnida.\n\u2018Not at all.\u2019 (You said something extraordinary.)\n(7) A: Ib\u014fn t\u2019oyoir-e uri chib-es\u014f ch\u014fny\u014fg-ina kach\u2019i ha-psida.\n\u2018This Saturday, let\u2019s have dinner together at my place.\u2019\nB: Papp\u016d-sil t\u2019ende, k\u016dr\u014f-siji anha-do toe-n\u016dndeyo ...\n\u2018As you must be busy, you don\u2019t have to do that ...\u2019\nPark\u2019s example (8) provides a neutral, trivial token with which one can start a\nconversation. Park points out that such a \u2018\u201cweather chat\u201d is a real ice-breaker\u2019:\n(8) Tar-i ch\u2019am pal-chiyo?\n\u2018The moon is very bright, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\nPark\u2019s examples (9) and (10) illustrate \u2018typical closing expressions\u2019 which use \u2018other\noriented tokens (e.g. mentioning time) or self-oriented ones (e.g. another appointment ...)\u2019:\n(9) Ani p\u014flss\u014f y\u014fl-han si-ga twae-nne.\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s already 11 o\u2019clock.\u2019\n(10) Ch\u014f-n\u016dn iman tar\u016dn yaksog-i iss-\u014fs\u014fyo ...\n\u2018Now, since I have another appointment ...\u2019\nAn indirect speech act like the one illustrated in example (11) can also signal a speaker\u2019s\nintention to end the conversation:\n(11) Sigan-\u016dl n\u014fmu mani ppaeas-\u014fs\u014f choesongha-mnida.\n\u2018I am sorry for having taken up so much of your time\u2019.\nFinally, referring to meetings in the future is another way to close interactions. Park\npoints out that even invitations that are made in this situation \u2013 like the one illustrated\nin example (12) \u2013 are \u2018just meaningless closings remarks\u2019: 112 Understanding pragmatics\n(12) (cid:430)nje uri chib-e han p\u014fn wa-ya ha-n\u016dnde.\n\u2018You should come to my place sometime.\u2019\nPark (2006: 162) includes the caveat that \u2018the recipient of these kinds of remarks should\nnot pursue or confirm further details about the next meeting ... s/he may casually\nrepeat what s/he has heard or could use another meaningless expression like Ne, k\u016dr\u014f-\npsida \u2018Let\u2019s do that\u2019.\nWith these Korean phatic expressions Park prominently illustrates the \u2018ice-breaking\u2019\nfunction of phatic communion in the opening phase of a conversation; he points out\nthe ritualized use of phatic expressions in specific settings in which interlocutors\ninteract and he illustrates how phatic expressions are used to assuage non-initiating\nparticipants in conversation closing phases. His claim, however, that propositions that\nare made in acts of phatic communion \u2013 like the one in example (12) \u2013 are meaningless\n(Park 2006: 162) only refers to the fact that this utterance must not be understood\nliterally. The situative context and the interactants\u2019 common cultural knowledge\nprovide the necessary information for understanding such a phatic expression as a\nmeans to consolidate the relationship between the interactants. Thus, even if what is\nsaid is not to be taken literally or seriously, it has some meaning for the relationship of\nthe interlocutors engaged in this phatic communion.\nWith his concept of \u2018phatic communion\u2019 Malinowski emphasized that language can\nbe used without any purpose of communicating ideas; however, as pointed out above,\nthis is only one aspect of his linguistic thinking. As one of the founding fathers of\nanthropological linguistics as a discipline in its own right, he pleaded for a linguistic\ntheory that \u2018would show us what is essential in language and what therefore must\nremain the same throughout the whole range of linguistic varieties [and] how linguistic\nforms are influenced by physiological, mental, social, and other cultural elements\u2019\n(Malinowski: 1920: 69). Thus, he was interested both in universal features of language\nand in the interrelationship between language, culture and cognition that is expressed\nin culture-specific features and phenomena of languages.\nMalinowski\u2019s contemporary Franz Boas (1858\u20131942), one of the founders of both\nAmerican anthropology and descriptive-structural linguistics, also understood\nlanguage as an unalterable prerequisite for his research (see Senft 2009c: 8). As Michael\nAgar (1994: 49) points out, \u2018language was then ... a part of anthropological fieldwork,\nand the point of fieldwork was to get to culture. Culture was the destination; language\nwas the path; grammar and dictionary marked the trail\u2019. Regna Darnell notes that\nBoas saw language as a symbolic form through which culture becomes accessible to\nstudy. Like Wilhelm von Humboldt \u2013 who strongly influenced him \u2013 Boas was\nconvinced that languages have an inner form, that they deserve to be described in their\nown terms. Darnell emphasizes that:\nBoas argued that each language stood as an independent packaging of what Sapir\u2019s\nstudent Benjamin Lee Whorf would later see as an amalgam of \u2018language, thought and\nreality.\u2019 The so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of the relationship between habitual\nthought to linguistic categories has its roots in this Boasian insistence on the unique\nperceptual patterning of each language and the equal value and expressive capacity of Pragmatics and ethnology 113\nevery natural language. Cultural relativism ... began with Boas\u2019 recognition that Indo-\nEuropean categories distorted languages on which they were imposed.\n(Darnell 2009: 46)\nThe next subsection will discuss Edward Sapir\u2019s and especially Benjamin Lee Whorf\u2019s\nhypotheses about linguistic relativity.\n4.3 LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY: THE SAPIR-WHORF HYPOTHESIS\nEdward Sapir, one of Boas\u2019s students, was very much interested in the relationship\nbetween language, culture and cognition. He took up Boas\u2019 rather cautiously\nformulated idea that \u2018it may be well to discuss the relation between language and\nthought. It has been claimed that the conciseness and clearness of thought of people\ndepend to a great extent upon their language\u2019 (Boas 1911: 60)7 and then summarized\nhis own ideas about the topic in the following provocative statements:\nLanguage is a guide to \u2018social reality\u2019. Though language is not ordinarily thought of\nas of essential interest to the students of social science, it powerfully conditions all\nour thinking around social problems and processes. Human beings do not live in the\nobjective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily\nunderstood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has\nbecome the medium of expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine\nthat one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language\nis merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication or\nreflection. The fact of the matter is that the \u2018real world\u2019 is to a large extent\nunconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. No two languages are\never sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The\nworlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same\nworld with different labels.\n(Sapir 1929: 210)\nA few years later he even speaks of \u2018the tyrannical hold that linguistic form has upon\nour orientation in the world\u2019 (Sapir 1931: 578). However, it was Sapir\u2019s student Benjamin\nLee Whorf who finally came up with the formulation of the concept of linguistic\nrelativity, namely in two papers that were published in 1940 (and reprinted in 1956)8.\nThere Whorf states the following:\nWe dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories and\ntypes that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they\nstare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic\nflux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds \u2013 and this means largely\nby the linguistic systems of our minds.\n(Whorf 1956: 213 [1940a]) 114 Understanding pragmatics\nThis is the weak formulation of the Sapir-Whorf (or rather the Whorf) hypothesis,9\nbecause of \u2018the escape hatch built into the thesis by means of the word \u201clargely\u201d\u2019\n(Seuren 2013: 41). The strong version reads as follows:\nThe phenomena of language are background phenomena of which the talkers are unaware\nor, at most, dimly aware ... These automatic, involuntary patterns of language are not the\nsame for all men but are specific for each language and constitute the formalized side of the\nlanguage, or its \u201cgrammar\u201d ... From this fact proceeds what I have called the \u201clinguistic\nrelativity principle\u201d, which means, in informal terms, that users of markedly different\ngrammars are pointed by their grammars toward different types of observations and\ndifferent evaluations of externally similar acts of observation, and hence are not equivalent\nas observers, but must arrive at somewhat different views of the world.\n(Whorf 1956: 221 [1940b])\nWhorf did not present these claims as a hypothesis but as established fact \u2013 he was\nconvinced that languages control the cognitive processes of their speakers \u2013 and this\ndirection of causality \u2013 from language to thought \u2013 is crucial for his argument.\nSince the late 1950s this hypothesis \u2013 especially its strong version which claims that\nlanguage determines thought \u2013 has been discussed quite controversially in linguistic,\nanthropological and sociological circles. However, many cognitive scientists, including\nlinguists and anthropologists, have been fascinated by the challenge presented in the\nweaker version of the hypothesis \u2013 which claims that language influences thought. Is\nthere a way to empirically test this claim?\nIn the 1990s a number of linguists and anthropologists attempted to test the weak\nversion of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. They tried to study the relationship between\nlanguage, culture and cognition by conducting fieldwork on issues of common interest\nto anthropology, psychology, and linguistics (see Levinson 2003). This research aimed\nto contribute to the development of more sophisticated theories about the relationship\nbetween learned and native abilities, about the contribution of culture to cognition,\nand about the nature and transmission of culture itself and its relation to social\nstructures and processes. The discussion of research questions like these has a rather\nlong tradition, of course, in which philosophers and scientists like Herder, Humboldt,\nand especially Boas, Sapir, and Whorf played a prominent role. A group of researchers\nat the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics have been trying to empirically\ninvestigate some of these questions on possible interdependencies between language,\nculture and cognition via the following stratagem, summarized by Penelope Brown\nand Stephen Levinson:\n(a) first, pick a conceptual domain; (b) second, find two or more languages which contrast\nin the semantic treatment of that domain (i.e., where very different semantic parameters\nare employed); (c) third, develop non-linguistic tasks which will behaviourally reveal the\nconceptual parameters utilized to solve them; (d) compare the linguistic and non-\nlinguistic representation systems as revealed by (b) and (c), and assess whether there is\nany correlation between linguistic and non-linguistic codings in the same domain.\n(Brown and Levinson 1993: 1) Pragmatics and ethnology 115\nThe first conceptual domain that was \u2018picked\u2019 by these researchers was the domain\nof \u2018space\u2019 with the major goal to investigate the conceptualization of space and spatial\nreference in a cross-cultural/cross-linguistic perspective (see Pederson et al. 1998;\nSenft 2001). To achieve this aim, the researchers developed specific methods to build a\ncomparative database through parallel field research in different languages and\ncultures. Inspired by research done by Herbert Clark and Deanna Wilkes-Gibbs (1986)\nthese methods of data elicitation make use of various sets of interactive \u2018games\u2019 which\nare used to elicit task-oriented verbal descriptions in native speakers of the language\nbeing studied. Most of these tasks involve the recognition or the construction of spatial\narrays from systematic sets of two- or three-dimensional stimuli. All interactional\ngames for focused linguistic elicitation involve a \u2018director\u2019 consultant who is allowed to\nsee a certain stimulus, and a \u2018matcher\u2019 who is not. The players are sitting side by side\nwith a screen separating them so that they cannot see each other\u2019s stimuli. The\norientation of the players is taken note of, and the field researcher instructs the players\nwhat to do in their own language \u2013 all instructions are standardized. Moreover, the\nfield researcher encourages the players to interact verbally, especially if they think they\nhave difficulties understanding each other. On the basis of the verbal descriptions\ngiven by the \u2018director\u2019 in the game, the \u2018matcher\u2019 is asked in some games to reproduce\nthree-dimensional configurations of familiar objects with intrinsic orientations, like a\nhuman statuette in various body poses and mini-landscapes inhabited by toy animals,\nas well as unfamiliar and abstract objects. Other games also involve the matching of\nphotographs on the basis of verbal descriptions; these photographs systematically\ncover certain spatial oppositions. With these methods, large corpora of contextually\nanchored yet complex interactive texts that incorporate many examples of spatial\nlanguage were elicited.10 The overall corpus includes data from 12 languages.\nThe analyses of the verbal data collected for the languages Longgu and Kilivila\n(Austronesian; Oceanic), Kgalagadi (Bantu), Dutch (Indo-European), Japanese, Hai//\nom (Khoisan),11 Tzeltal and Mopan (Maya), Mparntwe Arrernte (Pama-Nyungan),\nTamil (Tamil), Belhara (Tibeto-Burman) and Totonac (Totonac) revealed fundamental\ndifferences in how speakers of these languages refer to space. For describing these\ndifferences, the typology of spatial systems or frames of spatial reference illustrated in\nChapter Two (subsections 2.3 and 2.3.1.4) was used. The typology defines a \u2018relative\u2019,\nan \u2018absolute\u2019, and an \u2018intrinsic\u2019 frame of reference. The systems differ with respect to\nhow angles are projected from the \u2018ground\u2019 (or \u2018relatum\u2019) in order to situate the location\nof the focal object, the \u2018figure\u2019 (or \u2018theme\u2019) that is referred to.12 As mentioned in Chapter\nTwo, all three systems can be found in a given language, and they can be utilized for\nspatial reference; however, most of the languages seem to prefer one frame of reference\nin a particular context. On the basis of these observations, the researchers came up\nwith the following hypothesis:\nIf speakers of a language preferentially use one reference system in a particular spatial\ndomain, then these speakers will rely on a comparable coding system for memorizing\nspatial configurations and making inferences with respect to these spatial\nconfigurations in non-verbal problem solving.\n(Senft 2001: 527) 116 Understanding pragmatics\nTo falsify or verify this hypothesis, experiments to test the interrelationship between\nspace and cognition were developed.\nThe experiments are based on the cognitive implications of the three systems of\nverbal spatial reference. Relative (R), absolute (A), and intrinsic (I) systems differ with\nrespect to their dependence (+) or independence (\u2212)\n\u2013 with respect to the speaker\u2019s location and orientation,\nR + A \u2212 I \u2212\n\u2013 with respect to the rotation of the spatial configuration,\nR + A + I \u2212\nand\n\u2013 with respect to the rotation of the ground\nR \u2212 A \u2212 I+.\nThe experiments for the investigation of non-verbal spatial cognition explore the\nnature of the spatial coding for (recall and recognition) memory and (transitive)\ninference, and make it possible to determine whether this non-verbal coding has\ncertain specific properties. These properties were compared to the verbal codings\nelicited with the interactional games to see whether there was a correlation between\nthe verbal and the non-verbal systems of spatial coding. The tasks developed serve to\ninvestigate the opposition between the relative and intrinsic frames of reference that\nuse expressions like \u2018left/right/front/back\u2019 for spatial references on the one hand and\nthe absolute system that uses expressions like \u2018north/south/east/west, uphill/\ndownhill, seawards/landwards, upriver/downriver\u2019, etc., for spatial references on the\nother.13\nAll tasks have the same fundamental design. The consultants are shown a stimulus\non one table (Table 1) and are instructed to memorize what they have seen. After a\nshort delay they are rotated 180\u00b0 and led across to another table (Table 2) at a certain\ndistance which faces in the opposite direction from Table 1. The consultants are now\nasked to reconstruct the same array, or to select the same array from a set provided.\nThe stimulus arrays are so designed that they have either a left/right or a front/back\nasymmetry when viewed on Table 1. Figure 4.1 illustrates the design of these tasks (see\nBrown and Levinson 1993: 8; Senft 1994: 421). Suppose the consultants see an arrow\non Table 1 that is pointing from their point of view to the right. After a short pause and\nafter having been turned 180\u00b0 they are led to Table 2. There they find two arrows;\nagain, from their point of view one arrow is pointing to the right and the other arrow\nis pointing to the left. The consultants are asked now to choose the arrow that resembles\nthe one they just saw half a minute ago on Table 1. Consultants who memorized the\norientation of the arrow on Table 1 on the basis of a relative system of spatial coding\nwill select at Table 2 the arrow that \u2013 from their point of view \u2013 is also pointing to the\nright \u2013 here the fact that standing in front of Table 2 the consultants have turned 180\u00b0\nis of crucial importance. Consultants, however, that use an absolute system of spatial\ncoding, memorize the fact that the arrow on Table 1 pointed, e.g. towards north \u2013 they\nwill then select the arrow which is also pointing towards this direction on Table 2,\nregardless of the fact that they have turned 180\u00b0 (see Senft 2001: 528ff.). Pragmatics and ethnology 117\nFigure 4.1\nDesign of the experiments for the non-verbal solving of spatial problems\nTable 1 Table 2\nthgiR Left\nN\nN\nSTIMULUS TASK:\nrotation of\nsu saC mh eo ao ss e ta imrro uw\n180\u00b0 bject\ns lus\nABSOLUTE RELATIVE\nS Right\nS fteL\nThe analyses of the elicited verbal data revealed which systems of spatial reference were\nto be found in the languages researched and which systems were preferentially used by\nthe speakers of these languages. Based on these results and with the general hypothesis\nin mind, the researchers made predictions with respect to which results could be\nexpected in the non-verbal cognitive tasks for the various speech communities. Table\n4.1 summarizes these predictions and presents the results actually observed in\nanalysing the subjects\u2019 behaviour in the non-verbal tasks.\nTable 4.1\nVerbal and non-verbal codification of spatial configurations\nlanguage preferred system(s) of system(s) non-verbal codification\nverbal codification predicted found\nArrernte A A most A\nHai//om A, (I) A most A\nTzeltal A A A\nLonggu A A A, also R\nDutch R R R\nJapanese R R R, also A\nKilivila I, A (R) I, A I, A\nBelhara A A most A\nTamil (rural) A A A\nTamil (city) R R R\nKgalagadi R (A, I) R R, also A\nMopan I ad hoc R, A\nTotonac I ad hoc R, A\nA = absolute frame of reference\nR = relative frame of reference\nI = intrinsic frame of reference 118 Understanding pragmatics\nThis table shows that the researchers\u2019 hypothesis with respect to the interrelationship\nbetween verbal and non-verbal coding of spatial configurations is verified (for all\nlanguages except Mopan and Totonac; see Levinson 2003: 81ff., 93 and 188f. for an\nexplanation). Thus it seems that languages indeed allow inferences to be made about\nthe choice and the kind of conceptual parameters their speakers will use to solve\ncertain non-verbal problems within the domain \u2018space\u2019, about how they memorize\ncertain spatial configurations and about how they represent them in their long-term\nmemory. Thus, these results support the hypothesis that languages contribute in\nshaping thinking for non-verbal problem solving instances.\nHowever, even with results of studies like the one presented here, it remains\nsomewhat problematic to argue that it is only language that influences thought in\ngeneral. Although the research results show that speakers of specific languages have\nclear preferences for frames of spatial reference in their verbal behaviour and that these\npreferences allow for predictions with respect to the speakers\u2019 behaviour in non-verbal\nproblem solving tasks in the spatial domain, it should be taken into account that all the\nspeakers who prefer the absolute system can easily switch to forms of behaviour that\nare based on a relative system of spatial reference if necessary, for example when\ndriving a car and respecting right of way traffic rules. However, speakers that prefer a\nrelative or an intrinsic frame of spatial reference have severe difficulties in switching to\nan absolute system without using devices like a compass or a GPI system. It is interesting\nto connect these observations with Dan Slobin\u2019s insight that\nthe expression of experience in linguistic terms constitutes thinking for speaking \u2013 a\nspecial form of thought that is mobilized for communication. Whatever effects\ngrammar may or may not have outside of the act of speaking, the sort of mental activity\nthat goes on while formulating utterances is not trivial or obvious, and deserves our\nattention. We encounter the contents of the mind in a special way when they are being\naccessed for use. That is, the activity of thinking takes on a particular quality when it\nis employed in the activity of speaking. In the evanescent time frame of constructing\nutterances in discourse, one fits one\u2019s thoughts into available linguistic frames.\n\u201cThinking for speaking\u201d involves picking those characteristics of objects and events\nthat (a) fit some conceptualization of the event, and (b) are readily encodable in the\nlanguage ...\n(Slobin 1996: 76)\nSlobin also points out that the\nlanguages we learn in childhood are not neutral coding systems of an objective reality.\nRather, each one is a subjective orientation to the world of human experience, and this\norientation affects the ways in which we think while we are speaking.\n(Slobin 1996: 91; see also 1991: 23).\nA similar idea to Slobin\u2019s concept of \u2018thinking for speaking\u2019 seems to be the basis for\nSteven Pinker\u2019s criticism of Whorf. Pinker states that Pragmatics and ethnology 119\nWhorf was surely wrong when he said that one\u2019s language determines how one\nconceptualizes reality in general. But he was probably correct in a much weaker sense:\none\u2019s language does determine how one must conceptualize reality when one has to\ntalk about it.\n(Pinker 1989: 360)\nAnd Herbert Clark comments on Whorf\u2019s hypotheses in his article \u2018Communities,\nCommonalities and Communication\u2019 as follows:\nWhorf seemed to take for granted that language is primarily an instrument of thought.\nYet, this premise is false. Language is first and foremost an instrument of communication\n\u2013 the \u2018exchange of thoughts\u2019 \u2013 as one dictionary puts it \u2013 and it is only derivatively an\ninstrument of thought. If language has an influence on thought, as Whorf believed,\nthat influence must be mediated by the way language is used for communication. The\nalliteration14 in my title is not accidental, for communication, as its Latin root suggests,\nis itself built on commonalities of thought between people, especially those taken for\ngranted in the communities in which each language is used. Once this is made explicit,\nI suggest, we will find it difficult to distinguish many potential influences of language\non thought from the influences of other commonalities of mental life, especially the\nbeliefs, practices, and norms of the communities to which we belong.\n(Clark 1996b: 325)\nBy pointing out that language is not primarily an instrument of thought and just one part\nof many \u2018other commonalities of mental life\u2019 Clark reduces the impact of even the weak\nversion of the Whorf hypothesis to a piece, albeit an important one, within the complex\nmosaic of the interrelationship between language, culture and cognition. Consequently,\nClark defines his position with respect to Whorf\u2019s doctrines as follows: \u2018There can be no\n[human, G. S.] communication without commonalities of thought. But there can be\ncommonalities of thought, without communication\u2019 (Clark 1996b: 353).\nIt should be evident by now that researching the relationship between language,\nculture and cognition is a challenging but rewarding enterprise. Malinowski, Boas and\nSapir insisted that the use of language must be studied in its social context. As pointed\nout in subsection 3.3.1 above and elsewhere (Senft 2010a: 279), whoever wants to\ninvestigate the role of language, culture and cognition in social interaction must know\nhow the researched society constructs its reality. Researchers need to be on \u2018common\nground\u2019 with the researched communities, and this common ground knowledge is the\nprerequisite for any successful research within this domain. To achieve this aim the\n\u2018ethnography of speaking\u2019 approach provides a useful framework, because \u2013 as Joel\nSherzer pointed out \u2013\n[l]ike ethnoscience and cognitive anthropology as well as symbolic anthropology, the\nethnography of speaking is concerned with the community members\u2019 conceptions\nand representations of their culture and with their formalized frames for communicative\naction and interpretation.\n(Sherzer 1983: 16) 120 Understanding pragmatics\nThe next subsection of this chapter sketches out the characteristic features of this\nparadigm, its accomplishments and the criticism it has been facing since its introduction\nto the field of linguistic pragmatics.\n4.4 THE ETHNOGRAPHY OF SPEAKING15\nThe ethnography of speaking paradigm goes back to Dell Hymes\u2019 programmatic\npaper first published in 1962 (and republished in 1978). In the tradition of researchers\nlike Malinowski, Jakobson, Boas, Sapir and Whorf, he pointed out the fact that the\nstudy of speech is of \u2018crucial importance to a science of man\u2019 (Hymes [1962] 1978: 99;\nsee also 1974: 446). Therefore he called for \u2018\u2018ethological\u2019 studies of speaking in context\u2019\nand advocated \u2018a science of behavior\u2019 which he called the \u2018ethnography of speaking\u2019\n(Hymes [1962] 1978: 130ff.). As Sherzer has succinctly summarized, Hymes argued\nthat language and speech have a patterning of their own, as do social organization,\npolitics, religion, economics and law, and that therefore they merit attention by\nanthropologists \u2013 they cannot be taken for granted as somehow given or everywhere\nthe same. This patterning is not identical to the grammar of a language in the\ntraditional sense and yet is linguistic as well as cultural in organization.\n(Sherzer 1983: 11)\nHymes introduced the notions of \u2018speech style\u2019 and \u2018speech or communicative event\u2019 and\nargued that the meaning of an utterance can only be understood in relation to the speech\nevent in which it is embedded.16 Analyses of these styles or events require the minute\nstudy of, and the interrelationship between, what he called \u2018components\u2019. He grouped\nthese components into the following eight main entries that could be remembered with\nthe acronym SPEAKING (Hymes 1972a; see also Duranti 1988: 218):\nS (situation: setting and scene); P (participants: speaker/sender, addressor, hearer/\nreceiver/audience, addressee); E (ends: outcome, goals); A (act sequence: message form\nand message content); K (key [i.e., tone and manner in which something is said, G. S.]);\nI (instrumentalities: channel, forms of speech); N (norms: norms of interaction and\ninterpretation); and G (genres).\nAs Fitch and Philipsen (1995: 264) point out, these components were not \u2018a checklist of\nthings to describe\u2019 but rather \u2018an initial set of questions and descriptive possibilities in the\nstudy of ways of speaking in particular communities\u2019. Research within this paradigm\nresults in descriptions that capture \u2018each society\u2019s unique cultural organization of\nlanguage and speech\u2019 (Sherzer 1977: 44). This organization cannot be grasped by a\ntraditional grammar. Agreeing with Newman (1964: 448) that a grammar of a language\ntells us \u2018what a language can do but not what it considers worthwhile doing\u2019, Hymes\nemphasizes that a learner of a language need not only acquire the grammatical algorithm\nof this language, but also the rules that guide the communicative behaviour of members\nof the speech community that speak this language. Hymes argues as follows: Pragmatics and ethnology 121\nWe have \u2026 to account for the fact that a normal child acquires knowledge of sentences,\nnot only as grammatical, but also as appropriate. He or she acquires competence as to\nwhen to speak, when not, and as to what to talk about with whom, when, where, in\nwhat manner. In short, a child becomes able to accomplish a repertoire of speech acts,\nto take part in speech events, and to evaluate their accomplishments by others. This\ncompetence, moreover, is integral with attitudes, values, and motivations concerning\nlanguage, its features and uses, and integral with competence for, and attitudes toward,\nthe interrelation of language, with the other codes of communicative conduct.\n(Hymes 1972b: 277f.; see also [1962] 1978: 101).\nThis \u2018communicative competence\u2019 is expressed and therefore analysable \u2018in terms of\ndeterminate ways of speaking\u2019 (Hymes 1972a: 58). Hymes differentiates between the\nlabel \u2018ethnography of speaking\u2019 as a name for the approach and an ethnography of\nspeaking which studies how a specific speech community \u2018X\u2019 actually is speaking. For\nthese latter studies he prefers the label \u2018X\u2019s ways of speaking\u2019. He justifies this as follows:\nFirst, terms derived from \u2018speak\u2019 and \u2018speech\u2019 in English suffer from a history of\nassociation with something marginal or redundant \u2026 \u2018speech\u2019 should indicate use in\na positive sense \u2026 My second reason for favoring ways of speaking is that it has analogy\nwith \u2018ways of life\u2019, on the one hand, and Whorf\u2019s term \u2018fashions of speaking\u2019 on the\nother. The first analogy helps remind anthropologists that the ways of mankind do\ninclude ways of speaking, and helps remind linguists that speaking does come in ways,\nthat is, shows cultural patterning. And since Whorf was the first in American linguistic\nand anthropological tradition, so far as I know, to name a mode of organization of\nlinguistic means cutting across the compartments of grammar, it is good to honor his\nprecedence, while letting the difference in terms reflect the difference in scope of\nreference.\n(Hymes 1974: 445f.)\n\u2018Ways of speaking\u2019 or \u2018speech styles\u2019 are formally marked and therefore can be\nrecognized. Hymes further differentiates between \u2018varieties\u2019, which are defined as\n\u2018major speech styles [which are] associated with social groups\u2019, \u2018registers\u2019, which are\ndefined as \u2018major speech styles associated with recurrent types of situations\u2019, and\n\u2018personal, situational, and genre styles\u2019 (Hymes 1974: 440). As a \u2018good ethnographic\ntechnique\u2019 to classify speech events, speech styles, and ways of speaking, Hymes\nproposed to start looking at the metalinguistic labels the speech community under\nresearch uses to refer to them.\nAll the fine-grained differentiations Hymes proposes for doing research within the\nethnography of speaking paradigm allow for minute studies of various forms of\nlanguage use within specific speech communities. These studies are based on\nethnographic methods that are supplemented by other techniques for data gathering\nand analyses developed within related disciplines like, for example, sociolinguistics,\ndiscourse and conversation analysis, pragmatics, and anthropological linguistics/\nlinguistic anthropology. The paradigm understands \u2018linguistic performance as the\nlocus of the relationship between language and the sociocultural order\u2019 and studies 122 Understanding pragmatics\n\u2018what is accomplished through speaking and how speech is related to and is constructed\nby particular aspects of social organization and speakers\u2019 assumptions, values, and\nbeliefs about the world\u2019 (Duranti 1988: 210).\nIt is obvious that the goal of the ethnography of speaking paradigm was from its\nvery beginning extremely ambitious. In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of scholars,\nlike those who contributed to the volumes edited by Gumperz and Hymes (1964, 1972)\nand by Bauman and Sherzer (1974) contributed to establish and to develop the field.\nYet the paradigm\u2019s high scientific standards and its more or less implicit aim to\nemphasize the complex diversity of speech rather than reduce it to abstract principles\nand generalizations has given rise to critical comments.\nIn his review of Bauman\u2019s and Sherzer\u2019s (1974) anthology, one of the by now classic\npublications in the ethnography of speaking paradigm, Maurice Bloch first points out\nthat:\nto document the range of linguistic styles available to speakers in specific situations\nand then understand the use of these styles for social action \u2026 means a really high level\nof linguistic ability \u2026 [W]hat is required is the hypersensitivity which comes from a\ntotal control of the finest subtleties of language and social situations \u2026 The fieldworker\nmust also have an extremely thorough knowledge of the social organisation, the\nkinship system, the political system, the economic system, the trends towards change\nat work in the society concerned \u2026 In other words, the task of the ethnographer of\nspeaking \u2026 is of almost insurmountable difficulty.\n(Bloch 1976: 231ff.)\nThen he points out that despite the fact that one of the main concerns of the ethnography\nof speaking paradigm is the analysis of \u2018mundane ordinary speech intercourse\u2019 (Bloch\n1976: 233), the volume is dominated by studies that either deal with forms of ritual and\nartistic performance or with folk classifications concerning speech and communication.\nBloch\u2019s third point of criticism concerns the claim of the paradigm to include all\naspects of speech events in its descriptions. For him this aim is illusory because \u2018there\nis no end to reality and the description of ever smaller events, ever more carefully, gets\nus no nearer\u2019 (Bloch 1976: 234).\nHis last point of criticism concerns the fact that studies in the paradigm result in \u2018a\nmass of items from around the globe, all very valuable in themselves but not forming\ntogether an attempt to solve common problems and to move forward to ever more\ndocumented and incisive generalizations\u2019 (Bloch 1976: 234; see also 4.4.2 below).\nSherzer \u2013 responding to Bloch\u2019s criticism in 1977 \u2013 agreed that the paradigm so far\ndoes not offer a tertium comparationis17 which could serve as a basis for comparing\nstudies which are carried out in various speech communities by different researchers\nwithin the framework of the ethnography of speaking paradigm. He also pointed out\nthe need for filtering generalizations out of the vast number of different insights gained\nby these studies. Moreover, Sherzer agreed that future studies within the paradigm\nshould put at least as much emphasis on the study of everyday forms of speech as on\nthe study of formalized speech genres used in ritualized and ceremonial contexts and\nsituations (see Sherzer 1977: 50). Six years later Sherzer took up the challenge of Bloch\u2019s Pragmatics and ethnology 123\ncriticism and provided, with his book \u2018Kuna Ways of Speaking\u2019, an exemplary\ncontribution to the paradigm.\n4.4.1 Kuna ways of speaking\nThe Kuna are native Americans living in Panama and Colombia. They are\nagriculturalists who cultivate the jungle using the slash and burn technique. The Kuna\nlanguage to which they refer with the term tule kaya belongs to the Chibchan family;\nit is spoken by more than 50,000 people. With his monograph Kuna Ways of Speaking,\nSherzer provides an ethnography of speaking for the Kuna who live in the region of\nSan Blas on the Caribbean coast of Panama (see Sherzer 1983: 3).\nThe Kuna metalinguistically mark the differentiation between their own language \u2013\ntule kaya \u2013 the Kuna language (note that tule translates as \u2018person\u2019) and other languages\nlike, for example the Spanish language \u2013 waka kaya, the English language \u2013 merki kaya,\nthe neighbouring Choco language \u2013 sokko kaya, and so on. The tule kaya is differentiated\ninto the tule kaya proper and its ritual varieties sakla kaya \u2013 the chiefs\u2019 language or the\ngathering house language, the suar nuchu kaya \u2013 the stick doll language \u2013 this label refers\nto carved wooden stick dolls that represent spirits and serve as addressees for chants\nduring curing rituals and as mediators between curers and evil spirits \u2013 and the kantule\nkaya \u2013 the language used by the director of girls\u2019 puberty rites (the kantule) to address the\nspirit who is believed to be involved in these rituals (see Sherzer 1983: 22). These varieties\nof the Kuna language are phonologically, morpho-syntactically and lexico-semantically\nso different from each other that they have to be learned separately (see Sherzer 1983: 35).\nTo give just a few examples for lexical differentiation (see Sherzer 1983: 26ff.), the word\nfor \u2018foreigner\u2019 in tule kaya \u2013 in everyday Kuna \u2013 is waka, but in the chief language, sakla\nkaya, the word used to refer to such a person is tulepiitti. The word for \u2018woman\u2019 in the tule\nkaya is ome but in the suar nuchu kaya variety it is walepunkwa and in the kantule kaya\nvariety it is yai. In addition there are so-called play names or nicknames for animals that\ncan serve as synonyms for the everyday Kuna word that refers to this animal. Thus, the\nword for \u2018deer\u2019 in everyday Kuna is koe, but the nickname of this animal is upsan saya\nwhich translates as \u2018cotton ass\u2019. Although the four varieties of Kuna have the same\nphonemic inventory, the three ritual varieties use longer word forms than the variety\nused in everyday interaction. The longer forms are characteristic of the slower formal\nspeech of the ritual varieties of Kuna. In the tule kaya variety of Kuna, speech is rapid and\ninformal, final vowels and even syllables are often deleted and consonants are assimilated\nso that the deleted word form agrees with Kuna phonological rules and syllable structures.\nTo briefly illustrate this phenomenon: the English gloss \u2018to go to help\u2019 translates both the\nlong Kuna word form penetakkenae and the short form pentaynae, the English gloss \u2018in\nthe hammock\u2019 translates the long form kachikine and the short form kaski and the\nEnglish gloss \u2018he is mentioning me\u2019 translates the long word form aninukapipiemaiye as\nwell as the short form annuypimai (see Sherzer 1983: 36f.).\nSherzer illustrates the everyday variety and the three other varieties of the Kuna\nlanguage which pervade the areas of politics, curing and magic as well as puberty rites\nin Kuna ritual life with a number of examples.18 Unfortunately, he does not discuss\nordinary everyday conversation as detailed as the verbal art genres. 124 Understanding pragmatics\nIn what follows, Kuna ways of speaking will be illustrated by Kuna forms of greeting\nand leave-taking, by excerpts from curing and magical ikarkana formulae and from\nthe kantule ikar \u2013 the way of the kantule \u2013 which is shouted during the Kuna girls\u2019\npuberty rites.\n4.4.1.1 Kuna ways of greeting and leave-taking\nKuna ways of greeting and leave-taking depend on the social relationship of the\nindividuals involved, on the time of the day and on the period of time which has\nelapsed since friends and family members last saw each other. In general, greetings are\nnot obligatory (see Sherzer 1983: 159ff.). However, a greeting is usually initiated by\nsaying tekitte \u2013 which Sherzer glosses as \u2018well, then, hello\u2019. The response to this formula\nis anna, na \u2013 which Sherzer glosses as \u2018utterances with no translatable meaning\u2019. In the\nmainland jungle, however, greetings are obligatory and the simple exchange of\ngreetings just illustrated is usually expanded with an exchange of questions about the\nother person\u2019s planned or performed activities. However, when people leave their\nvillages for work in the morning and when they return again in the afternoon they\nmay expand their greetings with questions like Pia pe nae? \u2013 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019\nand Pia pe tanikki? \u2013 \u2018Where are you coming from?\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 160).19\nLonger greeting rituals are only performed by members of the same community or\nfriends or kin-persons who have not seen each other for some time, by members of\ndifferent communities visiting each other, or by two chiefs during an official visit\nwhen the greeting is public. In the latter case greetings are chanted by the chiefs in the\ngathering house of the visited village. The chants consist of questions and answers\nabout each other\u2019s health, activities and travel experiences. This form of greeting is\ncalled arkan kae \u2013 which literally means \u2018handshake\u2019. It is the only form of greeting\nwhich is metalinguistically labelled. Real handshakes also occur, however, only\nbetween men with official positions within a village who have not seen each other for\nsome time. If close friends and family members have been separated for a long time,\nthey pretend not to see each other and avoid one another when they meet for the first\ntime. They do not greet each other verbally, despite the fact that they are clearly aware\nof each other\u2019s presence. Although the individuals involved are aware of the fact that\nthe person who stayed at home stopped his or her usual everyday activities to be at the\nplace where the returning friend or relative is expected to arrive, there is no interaction\nbetween the two people involved until much later when they have arrived at home and\nrelax. Then they will greet each other \u2018asking and replying to a series of questions\nabout travels, activities and health, a pattern very much like the arkan kae performed\nby \u201cchiefs\u201d\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 160). Sherzer explains this marked form of avoidance\nbehaviour as follows:\n[T]his seeming avoidance \u2013 actually mutually acknowledged copresence \u2013 should be\nviewed not as the absence of greeting but as a slowing down and stretching out of the\ntotal greeting process, in which the initial portion is nonverbal. This slowing and\nstretching requires interactional work and is a reflection of a more general rule, namely,\nthe more special and significant the social relationship between individuals, the greater Pragmatics and ethnology 125\nthe amount of interaction necessary to mark and restore this relationship in greetings.\nThus close friends and family members prolong the greeting process by combining\npublic nonverbal, mutually acknowledged copresence with later private questioning\nand answering. And two \u2018chiefs\u2019, the political and ritual leaders of two distinct\ncommunities, prolong the greeting process by chanting a lengthy and public ritual\ngreeting in an esoteric language.\n(Sherzer 1983: 161)\nThe ways of leave-taking are parallel to the greetings, however, they are not as elaborate.\nEven so, Sherzer points out the following:\nIn a daily manifestation of the mutually acknowledged copresence greeting and leave-\ntaking pattern, Kuna wives accompany their husbands to their canoes as they leave for\nwork in the morning and meet them as they return, often without exchanging words.\n(Sherzer 1983: 161)\nSherzer\u2019s observations reveal that these rituals of greeting and leave-taking fulfil\nfunctions of securing and re-establishing bonds between individuals in the Kuna\ncommunities.\n4.4.1.2 Curing and magical ikarkana formulae\nThe Kuna \u2013 like the Trobriand Islanders \u2013 believe in the power of magic. They use\nmagical formulae to reach certain aims with the conviction that expert magicians can\ncontrol spirits of good and evil by addressing them with them. The formulae are called\nikarkana (which Sherzer glosses as \u2018ways, texts\u2019) and the magicians are referred to as\nikar wismalat \u2013 ikar knowers (see Sherzer 1983: 110ff.). The formulae are believed to\nactivate the powers of the good spirits and to neutralize the influence of the evil spirits.\nThey constitute a specific genre which is produced in curing rituals and other forms of\nmagic. Sherzer summarizes the characteristic features of this text type as follows:\nCuring and magical ikarkana consist of a series of themes, topics, and episodes\nwhich are strung together. While a primary characteristic of these ikarkana is that\nthey are putatively fixed or unchangeable in form, and thus must be learned by rote\nmemorization, there is some variation. Depending on the particular origins of the\ndisease or on the particular object of several possible objects to be controlled, choices\nare made in the selection of topics or themes. ... Ikarkana can also be made longer or\nshorter, according to the selection of appropriate episodes or themes. Once the\nselection has been made, however, the \u2018ikar knower\u2019 proceeds according to a line-by-\nline fixed text.\n(Sherzer 1983: 127)\nA typical feature of the ikarkana is parallelism \u2013 \u2018the patterned repetition of sounds,\nforms, and meanings\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 128). The following excerpt of a curing ikarkana\nillustrates the specifics of this Kuna way of speaking magical formulae. 126 Understanding pragmatics\nSherzer (1983: 129f.) provides only English glosses for a curing formula called \u2018the\nway of the cooling off\u2019:\nOur child has a feverish spirit.\nWe must cool off his spirit for him.\nWe must really cool off his spirit.\nThis basic form of the formula is repeated five more times, with the words for \u2018blood\u2019,\n\u2018skin\u2019, \u2018body\u2019, \u2018head\u2019 and \u2018hair\u2019 replacing the word for \u2018spirit\u2019.\nThis curing formula confirms the definition of ritual communication quoted in\nChapter Three (subsection 3.3.1), which points out that \u2018ritual communication is\nartful, performed semiosis, predominantly ... involving speech, that is formulaic and\nrepetitive and therefore anticipated within particular contexts of social interaction\u2019\n(Basso and Senft 2009: 1). The form, structure and function of the Kuna formulae\nSherzer presents in his monograph show many parallels with magical formulae\ndocumented in other languages and cultures (see, e.g. Endicott 1991; Malinowski 1935,\nVol. II; Senft 2010a: 40ff.; Skeat 1984).\n4.4.1.3 Excerpts from the kantule ikar shouted during the girls\u2019 puberty rites\nWhen a Kuna girl reaches puberty, the Kuna celebrate this rite of passage with puberty\nrites and festivities \u2013 the inna rites \u2013 that include cutting the girls\u2019 hair as short as is\nappropriate for adult women as well as communal meals and drinking of alcoholic\nbeverages by all members of the girl\u2019s village community (see Sherzer 1983: 139ff.).20 The\ncentral part of these rites is the shouting of a text (ikar) by the director (the kantule) of\nthese rites and rituals and his apprentices in an especially constructed inna house. The\nkantule and his apprentices stand, sit or lie in their hammocks in this enclosure and \u2018two\nat a time shout the very long kantule ikar (the way of the kantule), shaking rattles and\nblowing on the long flute (kammu) as they shout\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 144). The kantule ikar\naddresses the spirit of the kammu flute. The inna may last for two or more days. As\nmentioned above, the language of the kantule ikar is a highly ritualized variety of the\nKuna language called kantule kaya that is completely different from everyday colloquial\nKuna, especially with regard to vocabulary and thus extremely difficult to understand\nfor non-experts. Like curing and magical formulae, the kantule ikar describe in detail in\na kind of verse structure every part of the puberty rite and the activities that accompany\nit \u2013 from the preparation of the participants in the rite to the cutting of the initiates\u2019 hair\nto the communal eating and drinking. The long text represents \u2018the most immutable of\nall Kuna ritual discourse. It is repeated identically, including every single phoneme and\nmorpheme, each time it is performed\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 144). The following excerpts of the\nkantule ikar describe women participating in the rite:\nyaikana uuparpa imakte.\nThe women\u2019s underwear makes noise.\nyaikana uuparpa pukki nite.\nThe women\u2019s underwear can be heard far away. Pragmatics and ethnology 127\nyaikana kala tere imakte.\nThe women\u2019s coin necklaces make noise.\nyaikana kala tere pukki nite,\nThe women\u2019s coin necklaces can be heard far away.\nyaikana kala purwa imakte.\nThe women\u2019s bead necklaces make noise.\nyaikana kala purwa pukki nite.\nThe women\u2019s bead necklaces can be heard far away.\n(Sherzer 1983: 145f.)\nSherzer (1983: 147) points out that this text has \u2018a clearly defined poetic line structure.\nIn this passage every line begins with the noun yaikana (women) and ends with the\ntense-aspect and also line-final marker te (then)\u2019.\nLike the curing and magical formulae the kantule ikar constitutes a specific form of\nritual communication as defined in Chapter Three.\nWith his monograph, Sherzer attempted to present a more or less exhaustive\ntypology of a specific speech community\u2019s ways of speaking that are expressed in\nspecific metalinguistically differentiated varieties and which are manifest in a\nnumber of genres or text categories.21 Besides the different Kuna ways of speaking\nand the three genres illustrated here, Sherzer also provides and analyses examples of\ncommanding and requesting, narratives, gossip, humour, forms of speech play and\nverbal art, co-speech gestures, and chants and thus documents (almost) all the major\nforms of social interactions and speech situations of the Kuna (with the exception of\nordinary conversation). In addition, he also discusses \u2018the relationship between\nmusical structure and Kuna discourse structure\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 12f.). Sherzer points\nout that \u2018all Kuna speaking can be viewed as highly adaptive and strategic, finely\nattuned to contexts of usage and able to change in order to meet challenges from\nboth within and without Kuna society\u2019 (Sherzer 1983: 13). To achieve linguistic and\ncultural competence in the Kuna speech community requires the understanding of\nhow it structures, patterns and regulates its ways of speaking (see also Senft 2010a:\n286). Sherzer also points out that his close analysis of the Kuna ways of speaking also\ncontributes to more general theoretical issues, like, for example, \u2018the role of language\nand speech among American Indians, the relationship between ritual and everyday\nspeech and the nature of verbal art and verbal performance in nonliterate societies\u2019\n(Sherzer 1983: 14). In what follows the ethnography of speech paradigm will be\nassessed.\n4.4.2 The ethnography of speaking paradigm: a critical assessment\nIn his presentation of the paradigm, Alessandro Duranti (1988: 219) points out that the\n\u2018grid\u2019 of Hymes\u2019 SPEAKING model \u2018has always maintained an etic status and was\nnever accomplished by a (general) theory of the possible relationships among the\nvarious components\u2019 (see Senft 2010a: 284). The emic/etic distinction (from phonemic\nversus phonetic) made here goes back to Kenneth Pike (1954). Gustav Jahoda (1995:\n129) quotes French who defines the two approaches as follows: 128 Understanding pragmatics\nPike identifies the emic approach as a structural one. The investigator assumes that\nhuman behaviour is patterned, even though the members of the society being studied\nmay not be aware of many units of the structuring. In Pike\u2019s view, the goal of the emic\napproach is to discover and describe the behavioural system in its own terms,\nidentifying not only the structural units but also the structural classes to which they\nbelong.\nIn contrast, an etic approach can be characterized as an external one. Items of\nbehaviour are examined not in the light of the systems in which they occur, but rather\nin that of criteria brought to bear on them by the observer. The observer classifies all\ncomparable data into a system which he is creating, using criteria which were in\nexistence before the classification began.\n(French 1963: 398)\nDuranti also notes that many studies within the ethnography of speaking paradigm\ntry to show that the relationship among the components of the model is \u2018meaningful\nwithin a particular society\u2019 but that this is done in emic descriptions; thus, the majority\nof these studies \u2018do not \u2026 exemplify any universal principle of the relation between\nspeech and context in societies in general\u2019 (Duranti 1988: 219). He explains this\ntheoretical deficit as a possible \u2018reflection of the cultural relativism that [the\nethnography of speaking paradigm] shares with most of modern anthropology\u2019 and\npoints out that \u2018the care for specific emic accounts and the reluctance to posit universal\nprinciples \u2026 is strongly related to the fundamental anti-Universalism that characterizes\n[the ethnography of speaking paradigm] as originally defined by Hymes\u2019 (Duranti\n1988: 219). Fitch and Philipsen (1995: 264) also emphasize that \u2018comparison across case\nstudies is one of the central theoretical moves of the ethnography of speaking,\nabstraction from the complexities of particular cases into universal, independent\nprinciples is not\u2019; they also state, even more emphatically, that \u2018the thrust of the\nethnography of speaking has been to map the cultural and linguistic relativity of\nlanguage use, universal features or aspects of language use have been a secondary (or\nmore commonly, nonexistent) concern\u2019 (Fitch and Philipsen 1995: 267). Indeed, the\nfact that most publications within the paradigm have been restricted to one or two of\nits foci makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to compare these studies in order\nto extract possible theoretical generalizations.\nHowever, ever since the publication of the anthologies edited by Gumperz and\nHymes (1964, 1972) and by Bauman and Sherzer (1974), a large body of field work has\nbeen conducted under the auspices of the paradigm. In the 1970s and 1980s a large\nnumber of dissertations, books and articles were published, such as, for example, E.\nBasso (1985), K. H. Basso (1979), Feld (1982), and Gossen (1974). It is true that most\nresearchers focused their studies on specialized topics within the paradigm, such as\nintercultural communication (Gumperz 1982), verbal art (Sherzer and Urban 1986), or\nthe acquisition of communicative competence (Schieffelin and Ochs 1986).\nNevertheless, the impact the paradigm had on anthropological linguistics and\nlinguistic anthropology is impressively mirrored in Foley (1997), who dedicates one of\nthe six parts of his introduction to anthropological linguistics to the ethnography of\nspeaking framework (Foley 1997: 249\u2013378). Moreover, almost all the characteristic Pragmatics and ethnology 129\nfeatures of the paradigm surface in the titles of the contributions to the anthology\nedited by Duranti (2004). Researchers working in the ethnography of speaking\nparadigm have shown how important this framework with its components is for the\nresearch of speech in interaction and for the understanding of language use.22\n4.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis chapter first introduced Malinowski\u2019s theory about meaning and language. It was\npointed out that he saw language as a mode of behaviour, a mode of action in which the\nmeaning of a word or an utterance is constituted by its function within situative,\ncultural and social contexts. Meaning is also determined by essential uses of language.\nOne of these essential forms of language use is realized in what Malinowski calls phatic\ncommunion, a type of speech that is used at the beginning and at the end of social\ninteractions to establish and secure personal bonds between the interactants. He\npoints out that phatic communion does not serve any purpose of communicating\nideas and emphasizes that the expression of thoughts in speech is the most derivative\nand specialized use of language. However, it was shown that the function of phatic\ncommunion goes beyond the creation of ties of union: as a binding ritual it establishes\nand maintains a harmonious atmosphere and solidarity in interpersonal relations\nduring the opening and closing phases of social interactions. It also has indexical\nfunctions with respect to the interactants\u2019 status and social identity and it initiates\nroutine exchanges that can be rather rich in information. Although Malinowski\npointed out that language can be used without any purpose of communicating ideas,\nhe nevertheless was very much interested in the interrelationship between language,\nculture and cognition.\nThis interest was shared by Malinowski\u2019s contemporary Boas and his younger\ncolleagues Sapir and Whorf. Contrary to Malinowski, Sapir and especially Whorf saw\nlanguage primarily as an instrument of thought. Sapir and especially Whorf argued\nthat language determines, or at least influences, thought. This idea became known as\nthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The second part of this chapter presented the hypothesis\nin the light of a research project on spatial reference and the conceptualization of space\nin different languages and cultures. The results of this project support the hypothesis\nthat language contributes to shaping thinking for non-verbal problem solving.\nHowever, it was pointed out that it still remains problematic to argue that it is only\nlanguage that influences thought in general. Slobin\u2019s concept of \u2018thinking for speaking\u2019\nas a special form of thought and Clark\u2019s comments on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in\nwhich he emphasizes the fact that language is just one part of many other commonalities\nof mental life, that there is no speaking without mental activity but that there is mental\nactivity without speaking, reveal that further research is necessary to really understand\nthe complex interface of language, culture and thought.\nMalinowski, Boas and Sapir pointed out that speech must be studied in its social\ncontext. One of the prerequisites for studying the relationship between language,\nculture and cognition is to know how the researched speech communities construct\ntheir social and cultural realities. Researchers have to be on common ground with the 130 Understanding pragmatics\ncommunities they study and they have to acquire linguistic and cultural competence\nwithin these communities to understand how they structure, pattern and regulate\ntheir ways of speaking. The ethnography of speaking paradigm founded by Dell\nHymes offers an excellent, though complex, framework for pursuing these ambitious\naims. The last part of this chapter provided a brief introduction to the ethnography of\nspeaking framework which seeks to study the influence of situations, participants,\nends, act sequences, keys, instrumentalities, norms and genres of speech styles and\nspeech events. This approach to understanding language use was illustrated with\nexamples from Joel Sherzer\u2019s seminal study of the Kuna ways of speaking. When one\nassesses the ethnography of speaking approach one must concede that the vast majority\nof research results gained so far are case studies that make it extremely difficult to\ncome up with generalizations. However, this research has proved that the study of\nspeech in interaction needs to be rooted in such complex frameworks like the one\nprovided by the ethnography of speaking paradigm.\nWhat does this chapter tell us about the anecdote reported in the introduction to\nthis volume? It reveals once more that I misunderstood the Trobriand Islanders\u2019\ngreeting ritual as just phatic communion in Malinowski\u2019s sense. The question of the\ngreeting was actually meant to elicit information \u2013 which I provided in complex serial\nverb constructions once I had learned how to adequately respond to this greeting\nformula. This insight into the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 ways of greeting was one of many\nsteps towards getting on common ground with the community I wanted to study and\nthus towards acquiring the communicative competence necessary to achieve this aim\n(see Senft 2010a). By contrast, the greeting question \u2018Are you going somewhere?\u2019,\nprovided as one of the examples from Korean to illustrate the concept of phatic\ncommunion, is not meant to elicit information. Thus, my first reactions towards the\nTrobrianders\u2019 greeting question would have been culturally appropriate in social\ninteractions with speakers of Korean.\n4.6 EXERCISE/WORK SECTION\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Discuss Malinowski\u2019s position that \u2018to regard language as a means for the\nexpression of thought is to take a one-sided view of its most derivative and\nspecialized functions\u2019.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Carry out an experiment in which you video-document an encounter between at\nleast three dyads of friends, co-students or other acquaintances of yours (one dyad\nconsisting of males and one of females only, the third dyad consisting of a male and\na female participant). One of the interactants should be sitting on a chair in a room\nwhile the camera (which is in sight of the participants) is running. You ask the\nother interactant to enter the room and sit down on the chair close to the other\nperson. After ten minutes you enter the room and tell the participants that you\nhave to stop the experiment now \u2013 but you let the camera run until the participants\nin your experiment have left the room. Describe and analyse how the participants\nin this experiment open and close their interaction and look for what kind of forms Pragmatics and ethnology 131\nor tokens of phatic communion you observe and if they differ with respect to\ngender. Feel free to come up with other designs of such an experiment on the use\nof tokens of phatic communion at the beginning and at the end of an encounter\nbetween two or more people (who may or may not know each other) in more\nnatural locations and situations.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Look at film scenes that depict first encounters of two interactants and describe\nwhether you can observe tokens of phatic communion and if so, what kinds of tokens\nof phatic communion are used in these dialogues. If you cannot observe any forms\nof phatic communion during such first encounter scenes, try to explain why.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Discuss whether or not the strong form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which\nclaims that language determines thought is a tenable hypothesis.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Think of one other domain than space in which one could find effects that may\nsupport at least the weak form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, explain why you\nchose this domain and elaborate on ways to test your hypothesis.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Compare the ways of speaking you understand as being typical for your mother-\ntongue with the ways of speaking you or others take as being typical of another\nlanguage community.\n4.7 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING\nAuer and di Luzio (1992); Basso, K.

For phatic communion see Senft (1996b, 2009e).\n2 This statement is echoed by Hockett (1973: 675) who points out that \u2018[l]inguistics without\nanthropology is sterile; anthropology without linguistics is blind\u2019.\n3 Compare Richard Bauman (1992: 147) who also emphasizes that \u2018meaning resides in the\npragmatic function of an utterance\u2019.\n4 Note that \u2018phatic communion\u2019 must not be confused with Austin\u2019s \u2018phatic act\u2019. See\nsubsection 1.2.3 of Chapter One.\n5 John Laver (1975: 221) refers to David Abercrombie who points out that \u2018[t]he actual sense\nof the words used in phatic communion matters little\u2019 (Abercrombie 1956). Abercrombie\nthen \u2018goes on to recount the story of Dorothy Parker [an American poet and short story\nwriter. G. S.], alone and rather bored at a party, [who was] asked \u201cHow are you? What have\nyou been doing?\u201d by a succession of distant acquaintances. To each she replied \u201cI\u2019ve just 132 Understanding pragmatics\nkilled my husband with an axe, and I feel fine.\u201d Her intonation and expression were\nappropriate to party-talk, and with a smile and a nod each acquaintance, unastonished,\ndrifted on\u2019. See also Parker\u2019s short story \u2018Here we are\u2019 in Parker (1944).\n6 But note that Duk-Soo Park (2006: 156) refers to Cheepen (1988: 20f.) who points out that \u2018phatic\ncommunion is not confined to the opening and closing phases, but also occurs as short words\nor phrases (e.g. \u201cwell\u201d, or \u201cyou know\u201d) among other, non-phatic speech, and it can also (and\noften does) extend over a whole encounter (such as a chat), which may last for several hours\u2019.\n7 Boas himself never pursued this idea \u2013 which he may have taken from Wilhelm von\nHumboldt.\n8 But see also Whorf (1956: 134\u2013159 [1941]). For a survey of the origins and the influence of\nthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis see Koerner (2000) and Lee (1996, 2010).\n9 I agree with Pieter Seuren (2013) that it is more appropriate to speak of the \u2018Whorf\nhypothesis\u2019; however, given the fact that the term \u2018Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\u2019 by now has a\ncertain tradition in linguistics, I use this label to refer to Whorf\u2019s claims about the\nrelationship between language, culture and cognition.\n10 For a description and a critical assessment of these methods see Senft (2001) and especially\n(2007).\n11 The // in the name of the language Hai//om is the symbol for a non-pulmonic consonant,\nthe voiceless alveolar lateral click.\n12 In the sentence \u2018The socks are in the drawer\u2019 one differentiates between the entity to be\nsituated, the \u2018theme\u2019 or the \u2018figure\u2019, namely the socks, and the reference object or the entity\nin relation to which the theme is situated \u2013 which is called the \u2018relatum\u2019 or \u2018ground\u2019 \u2013\nnamely the drawer. The spatial relation between \u2018figure\u2019 and \u2018ground\u2019, or \u2018theme\u2019 and\n\u2018relatum\u2019 in this example is \u2018being in\u2019.\n13 The design of these experiments enables one to distinguish between absolute and other\nframes of references, though not between intrinsic and relative frames. Speakers of\nlanguages which prefer the intrinsic system for verbal spatial references will behave in these\nexperiments like speakers of languages which prefer the relative frame of spatial reference.\n14 That is, all nouns in the title of Clark\u2019s paper start with a \u2018c\u2019.\n15 The first part of this subsection draws on Senft (2010a: 280ff.).\n16 Note Malinowski\u2019s influence with respect to the role of context for meaning.\n17 A tertium comparationis (the third in comparison) is the element that remains constant\nwhen different things, features, etc. are compared.\n18 It has to be noted, though, that he does not always provide the original Kuna transcription;\nmoreover, he does not present morpheme-interlinearized transcriptions either.\n19 This is reminiscent of the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 greeting behaviour; however, Sherzer does\nnot provide any information about the degree of truth expected by the Kuna in the answers\nto these questions.\n20 There are no puberty rites for Kuna boys (see Sherzer 1983: 140).\n21 For another such attempt see Senft (2010a).\n22 The debate about diversity versus universality and/or specificity versus generalization seems\nto be a recurrent pattern in theoretical discussions within the humanities. Compare, for\nexample, the critical discussion of the ethnography of speaking paradigm presented here\nwith the reaction of the linguistic peer group to Evan\u2019s and Levinson\u2019s (2009a and b) papers\non \u2018The myth of language universals\u2019 in Volume 32(5) of the journal Brain and Behavioral\nSciences and in Volume 120(12) of the journal Lingua (see Levinson and Evans 2010) or with\nthe discussion about generalizations and other claims about human psychology and\nbehaviour that are based on experiments with WEIRD (i.e. western, educated, industrialized,\nrich and democratic) subjects, initiated by Henrich et al. (2010a and b). 5\nPragmatics and sociology\nEveryday social interaction\n5.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the research of three North American sociologists had a strong\nimpact on the understanding of human everyday face-to-face interaction in general\nand on the understanding of communicative behaviour and language use in particular\n\u2013 especially in conversation.\nThe first part of this chapter features Erving Goffman\u2019s (1922\u20131982) insights in, and\nideas about, social interaction.\nThe second part of this chapter deals with Harold Garfinkel\u2019s (1917\u20132011)\nethnomethodological studies on social order, his understanding of everyday \u2018common\nsense\u2019 knowledge and his ideas about how we make sense of our social world.\nInfluenced by Garfinkel, but also by Goffman, Harvey Sacks (1935\u20131975) developed\nthe field of \u2018Conversation Analysis\u2019 (CA) to research how conversation is ordered and\nstructurally organized. The third part of this chapter presents central aspects and\nresearch results of the CA approach and recent developments within this field.\n5.2 ERVING GOFFMAN\u2019S INTERACTION ORDER\nErving Goffman\u2019s research focused on social interaction that is guided and regulated\nby normative rights and obligations. He understood the study of face-to-face\ninteractions as a subdiscipline of sociology. In his 1983 (undelivered) presidential\naddress to the American Sociological Association Goffman proposed to call this\nsubarea of his discipline \u2018the interaction order\u2019. Kendon notes that American\nsociologists before Goffman had studied interaction as \u2018a means to an end\u2019:\n[Their] approaches took the view that the phenomena of usual concern to sociology and\nsocial psychology \u2013 leadership, social stratification, organization of authority, and the\nlike \u2013 must be grounded in the patterning of specific acts of interaction between society\u2019s\nmembers. Such acts were to form the basic data upon which the investigation of such\nphenomena was to be based. However, the acts of interaction were not themselves\nstudied. Only an aspect of them was seized upon as a means toward studying something\nelse. Goffman recognized this and made it clear that what he was concerned with was\ndifferent: it was to raise the question as how interaction is possible in the first place.\n(Kendon 1988c: 19) 134 Understanding pragmatics\nGoffman (1967: 2) made it clear that for him \u2018the proper study of interaction is not\nthe individual and his psychology, but rather the syntactical relations among the acts\nof different persons mutually present to one another\u2019.1 Based on the Aristotelian insight\nthat human beings are social animals who spend most of their daily life \u2018in the\nimmediate presence of others\u2019, he pointed out that all their \u2018doings are likely to be ...\nsocially situated\u2019 (Goffman 1983a: 2). Face-to-face interactions occur in social situations\nin which persons are \u2018co-present with one another\u2019 and where \u2018they must sense that\nthey are close enough to be perceived in whatever they are doing, including their\nexperiencing of others and close enough to be perceived in this sensing of being\nperceived\u2019 (Goffman 1963: 17). This concept of the social situation is central for\nGoffman\u2019s research. He refers to a social situation in which \u2018people effectively agree to\nsustain for a time a single focus of cognitive and visual attention, as in a conversation\u2019,\nas a \u2018focused gathering\u2019 or an \u2018encounter\u2019; and he differentiates such an encounter from\n\u2018unfocused interaction\u2019 which \u2018consists of those interpersonal communications that\nresult solely by virtue of persons being in one another\u2019s presence\u2019, like, for example\npeople walking along in a city or town street (Goffman 1961: 8). In Goffman\u2019s\ninteraction order:\nthe engrossment and involvement of the participants \u2013 if only their attention \u2013 is\ncritical ... Emotion, mood, cognition, bodily orientation, and muscular effort are\nintrinsically involved, introducing an inevitable psychobiological element. Ease and\nuneasiness, unselfconsciousness and wariness are central.\n(Goffman 1983a: 3)\nThus, even in unfocused forms of interaction like walking in a street, people mutually\ncoordinate their behaviour. Goffman describes this behaviour as a minimal interactive\nritual which he calls \u2018civil inattention\u2019. In this situation people who pass each other may\n\u2018glance at one another but mutually agree not to let their eyes meet, and do so in a way\nthat lets each know that the other is not scared, hostile or that he regards the other as\nan automaton\u2019 (Kendon 1988c: 25). Focused gatherings, however, are much more\ncomplex. Goffman points out that:\n[o]nce individuals \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 come into one another\u2019s immediate presence,\na fundamental condition of social life becomes enormously pronounced, namely its\npromissory, evidential character. It is not only that our appearance and manner\nprovide evidence of our statuses and relationships. It is also that the line of our visual\nregard, the intensity of our involvement, and the shape of our initial actions, allow\nothers to glean our immediate intent and purpose, and all this whether or not we are\nengaged in talk with them at the time. Correspondingly, we are constantly in a position\nto facilitate this revealment, or block it, or even misdirect our viewers. The gleaned\ncharacter of these observations is itself facilitated and complicated by a general process\nyet to be systematically studied \u2013 social ritualization \u2013 that is, the standardization of\nbodily and vocal behavior through socialization, affording such behavior \u2013 such\ngestures, if you will \u2013 a specialized communicative function in the stream of behavior.\n(Goffman 1983a: 3) Pragmatics and sociology 135\nIn these encounters, participants \u2018provide information in two ways: they give it, and\nthey give it off\u2019 (Kendon 1988c: 22). This holds when people talk with each other as\nwell, of course. Besides the information provided through the verbal channel,\nadditional information is provided by the interactants; however, it is for the respective\nparticipant in the interaction to decide whether this information is given voluntarily\nor involuntarily by his or her co-participant. Kendon emphasizes that Goffman\u2019s\nobservation is extremely important for the study of all forms of social interaction,\nincluding conversations:\nIn any situation of interaction ... participants treat only some aspects of each other\u2019s\nbehaviour as if it is deliberately intended to convey something. In conversations it is\nusually the something called \u2018content of talk\u2019 that is treated in this way, not the manner\nof talk, and certainly not the bodily stagings and ecological arrangements within which\nthe talk is carried on. However, it is not as if these other aspects of the situation play no\nrole in the structuring of the interaction. Far from it. Their role is crucial to the whole way\nin which the event is organized. We owe Goffman a major debt for getting us to see this.\n(Kendon 1988c: 23)\nPeople who engage in face-to-face interaction thus \u2018fashion the situations in which\nthey participate through the ways in which they conduct themselves and read the\nconduct of others\u2019 (Drew and Wootton 1988: 5). There are procedures and conventions\nregulating rights and obligations that provide interactants with basic rules for playing\ntheir interaction game. Goffman compared them with traffic rules or syntactic rules\nin a language. These rules \u2013 based on social contract and social consensus, that is to\nsay, on \u2018social order\u2019 \u2013 \u2018inform the interaction order and allow for a traffic of use\u2019\n(Goffman 1983a: 6; see also 1971: xf.). The interactants have to come up with a shared\nagreement on their interaction situation. As Goffman points out,\n[t]his includes agreement concerning perceptual relevances and irrelevancies, and a\n\u2018working consensus\u2019 involving a degree of mutual considerateness, sympathy, and a\nmuting of opinion differences ... At the same time a heightened sense of moral\nresponsibility for one\u2019s acts also seems to develop.\n(Goffman 1963: 96ff.)\nIn \u2018interpersonal rituals\u2019 the social relationship between interactants are affirmed and\nsupported. These rituals encompass accounts, apologies, \u2018tie-signs ... that indicate the\nnature of relationships between persons\u2019 and \u2018normal appearances ... [i.e.] signs ... that\nnothing in the world is out of the ordinary and routines may be followed as usual\u2019\n(Goffman 1971: 63, 109, 194, 239). Goffman\u2019s reference to the interactants\u2019 \u2018sense of\nmoral responsibility\u2019 in an encounter shows that for him interaction has important\nmoral aspects and implications. And here his notions of \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018face\u2019 play an\nimportant role. Goffman defines \u2018face\u2019 as follows:\nEvery person lives in a world of social encounters, involving him either in face-to-face\nor mediated contact with other participants. In each of these contacts, he tends to act 136 Understanding pragmatics\nout what is sometimes called a line \u2013 that is, a pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts by\nwhich he expresses his view of the situation and through his evaluation of the\nparticipants, especially himself. ...\nThe term face may be defined as the positive social value a person effectively claims\nfor himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact. Face is\nan image of self delineated in terms of approved social attributes \u2013 albeit an image that\nothers may share, as when a person makes a good showing for his profession or religion\nby making a good showing for himself.\n(Goffman 1967: 5)\nGoffman sees the self as \u2018a social product ... that ... depends upon validation [of\nindividuals\u2019 performances in social situations] awarded and withheld in accordance\nwith the norms of a stratified society\u2019. These norms are constituted by the rules and\nrituals of the social order \u2013 which make the self also \u2018an object of social ritual\u2019\n(Branaman 1997: xlvi, lxiii). However, for Goffman self is also a \u2018kind of player in a\nritual game who copes honorably or dishonorably, diplomatically or undiplomatically,\nwith the judgmental contingencies of the situation\u2019 (Goffman 1967: 31). Thus, although\nthe self is seen first and foremost as being a social product, individuals are nevertheless\nable to strategically manipulate the social situations and especially the impressions\nthey invoke in others \u2013 like an actor on a theatre stage. This Janus-like understanding\nof the self in Goffman\u2019s approach is captured by Branaman (1997: xlviii) when she\nnotes: \u2018the self is the mask the individual wears in social situations, but it is also the\nhuman being behind the mask who decides which mask to wear\u2019. Branaman concisely\nsummarizes the interrelationship between the concepts of self and face in Goffman\u2019s\nthinking as follows:\nIt is through our attachment to self that we are attached to society. We maintain face\nby following social norms, showing deference for and affirming the dignity of others,\nand presenting ourselves in accordance with our own places in the status hierarchy.\nThe main function of \u201cface work\u201d \u2013 interactional work oriented towards affirming\nand protecting the dignity of social participants \u2013 is to maintain the ritual order of\nsocial life.\n(Branaman 1997: lxiii)\nIn his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life Goffman points out that social life\nand the structural properties of social encounters can be analysed from the perspective\nof the dramatic performance. There are actors who play their part with the aim to\nimpress in one way or another an audience which consists of co-participants, observers\nor bystanders. Goffman describes a social encounter of two or more people as a\nstructured event with a clear opening and closing phase:\nThe opening will typically be marked by the participants turning from their several\ndisjointed orientations, moving together and bodily addressing one another; the\nclosing by their departing in some physical way from the prior immediacy of\ncopresence. Typically, ritual brackets will also be found, such as greetings and farewells, Pragmatics and sociology 137\nthese establishing and terminating open, official joint engagement, that is, ratified\nparticipation. ... Throughout the course of the encounter the participants will be\nobliged to sustain involvement in what is being said and ensure that no long stretch\noccurs when no one ... is taking the floor.\n(Goffman 1981: 130)\nIn what Goffman calls \u2018moments of talk\u2019 one usually distinguishes the notions of\nhearer and speaker. With hearers \u2013 or listeners or recipients \u2013 Goffman differentiates\nbetween ratified participants \u2013 that is participants in an encounter addressed both\nverbally and visually and recognized by the speaker \u2013 and unratified participants or\nbystanders, who may either unintentionally \u2018overhear\u2019 what is said or who follow these\nmoments of talk intentionally as eavesdroppers. Goffman points out that the relations\nbetween speaker, addressed and unaddressed recipients is \u2018complicated, significant,\nand not much addressed\u2019 (Goffman 1981: 131ff.).\nHearers or recipients of moments of talk are not only found in conversations,\nmeetings, hearings and other situations in which persons come together. Talk can also\ntake the form of what Goffman calls a \u2018platform monologue, as in the case of political\naddresses, ... lectures, dramatic recitations, poetry readings\u2019 and so on. These platform\nperformances constitute another important interaction entity that can have a \u2018live\naudience\u2019, a \u2018broadcast audience\u2019 and even \u2018imagined recipients\u2019 \u2013 as in \u2018radio and TV\ntalk\u2019 (Goffman 1981: 137f.). The largest interactional unit in Goffman\u2019s approach is\nconstituted by \u2018celebrative social occasions\u2019 which Goffman defines as \u2018foregathering[s]\nof individuals admitted on a controlled basis, the whole occurring under the auspices\nof, and in honor of, some jointly appreciated circumstances\u2019 (Goffman 1983a: 7).\nFor the notion of speaker Goffman identifies three roles: the animator, the author\nand the principal. The animator is \u2018the talking machine ... an individual active in the\nrole of utterance production ... Animator and recipient are part of the same level and\nmode of analysis ... not social roles in the full sense so much as functional nodes in a\ncommunication system\u2019. The author is \u2018someone who has selected the sentiments that\nare being expressed and the words in which they are encoded\u2019, and the principal is\n\u2018someone whose position is established by the words that are spoken, someone whose\nbeliefs have been told, someone who is committed to what the words say\u2019. The animator\nis defined as \u2018a person active in some particular social identity or role ... as a member of\na group, office, ... association or whatever\u2019. The individual as animator \u2018speaks ... in the\nname of \u201cwe\u201d, not \u201cI\u201d... the \u201cwe\u201d including more than self\u2019. The configuration of these\nthree roles constitutes the \u2018production format of an utterance\u2019 (Goffman 1981: 144f.).\nGoffman decomposes, so to speak, the notion of hearer or recipient and speaker to\npoint out that these \u2018commonsense notions ... are crude, ... concealing a complex\ndifferentiation of participation statuses and ... complex questions of production format\u2019.\nThis decomposition also reveals \u2018that the notion of a conversational encounter does not\nsuffice in dealing with the context in which words are spoken ... the whole social situation,\nthe whole surround, must always be considered\u2019 (Goffman 1981: 144ff.).\nMoreover, Goffman points out that interactants in an encounter can change their\nsocial role in a very dynamic way. How Goffman\u2019s approach to the interaction order\ndeals with these dynamics is summarized by Jim O\u2019Driscoll: 138 Understanding pragmatics\nIn reality, of course, the participation status of those involved in talk is changing all the\ntime, not just because who is talking and who they address can change but, more\ncrucially, because of what is said. Part of Goffman\u2019s ritual model assumes that anything\ndone in interaction always and inevitably carries implications about the character of\nthe person who says it, that person\u2019s evaluation of other participants and the relationship\nbetween them ... To capture these potentially infinitely mutable personal circumstances,\nGoffman uses the term footing, which he defines as \u201cthe alignment we take up to\nourselves and others present as expressed in the way we manage the production and\nreception of an utterance\u201d (1981: 128). In addition, anything said also carries an\nimplication about what sort of thing is going on, about how the speaker construes the\nexperience. This is where Goffman\u2019s use of the concept of frame comes in. For him, a\nframe is \u201cprinciples of organization which govern events \u2026 and our subjective\ninvolvement in them\u201d (Goffman 1974: 10). Now, it should be obvious that framing does\nnot take place independently of the abovementioned concerns. When something is\nsaid which effectively claims a definition of the situation, it simultaneously makes\nclaims about the participants and their relationships. Therefore, \u201ca change in footing is\nanother way of talking about a change in our frame for events\u201d (1981: 128).\n(O\u2019Driscoll 2009: 88)\nTo analyse and capture these dynamics is extremely complex. Goffman explained\nwhy: \u2018As dramatists can put any world on their stage, so we can enact any participation\nframework and production format in our conversation\u2019 (Goffman 1981: 155).\nGoffman himself tried to illustrate and analyse the complex structural properties of\nsocial interactions in his writings. In what follows, three examples in which he\ndiscussed and analysed forms of social interaction and the sequential ordering of\nactions are presented.\nIn his micro-analysis of contacts between socially acquainted persons, Goffman\nmakes the following observations: If two people who know each other meet, \u2018each\nparty of the relationship will be obliged to recall on sight the name of the other, along\nwith some biographical detail\u2019 (Goffman 1983b: 41f.). This knowledge must be\ndisplayed when they greet each other. The closer the interactants know each other, the\nricher is their knowledge about each other\u2019s biography. Goffman illustrates this as\nfollows:\nFor example, if Marsha and Martha are adult close friends, then each is likely to know,\nand be expected to know, critical matters about the other\u2019s close others, enough so that\neach can efficiently report stories involving her own others. I might add that ceremonies\nof greeting and departure in our society often require reference to these \u2018other person\u2019s\nothers\u2019, this being a case where what can be asked about ought to be asked about.\n(Goffman 1983b: 42)\nClosely acquainted people also feel obliged to update each other with respect to changes\nin their life circumstances; they expect to receive such reports and feel entitled to make\nenquiries about such issues. However, it goes without saying that these enquiries are\nmade with \u2018referential tact\u2019. That is to say, they have to be phrased in such a way that Pragmatics and sociology 139\nthey are inoffensive and not indelicate in the given situation.2 Goffman illustrates this\nsituation with the following example:\nMeeting John on the street, his friend has the right (indeed, often the obligation) to\nask him how his wife Marsha is and to use her first name as a fully specifying\ndesignation; John will know which Marsha his friend is referring to and will have a\nready answer. Meeting John on the street just after John (it is known) has broken up\nwith Marsha, his friend omits the nicety, and not because John would not know who\nwas being spoken of.\n(Goffman 1983b: 28)\nOn the basis of these considerations Goffman defines such a relationship between\nacquainted people as follows:\n[What] we think of as a relationship is, in one sense, merely a provision for the use of\ncryptic expressions, a provision of what is required in order to allude to things\neconomically. Certainly our obligation to keep the names of our friends in mind, along\nwith other pertinent social facts concerning them, is more than a means of celebrating\nand renewing our social relationship to them; it also ensues a shared orientation for\nreference and hence talk whenever we come into contact with them. What affirms\nrelationships also organizes talk.\n(Goffman 1983b: 42)\nAnother example with which Goffman illustrates his approach of context micro-\nanalysis is the \u2018service transaction\u2019 in which\na \u201cserver\u201d, in a setting prepared for the purpose, perfunctorily and regularly provides\ngoods of some kinds to a series of customers of clients, typically either in exchange for\nmoney or as an intermediate phase in bureaucratic processing.\n(Goffman 1983a: 14)\nBoth interactants, the server and the served, find each other in the same social situation\nwhich is characterized by a specific institutionalized format. Goffman points out that\nthe service transaction is characterized by at least two rules:\nFirst, there is a basic understanding between the parties involved that everybody\nwill be treated equally. This \u2018principle of equality\u2019 has important implications, of\ncourse:\nIn order to deal with more than one candidate for service at a time in what can be\nperceived as an orderly and fair manner, a queuing arrangement is likely to be\nemployed, this likely involving a first come first serve rule. This rule produces a\ntemporal ordering that totally blocks the influence of such differential social statuses\nand relationships as candidates bring with them to the service situation \u2013 attributes\nwhich are of massive significance outside the situation ...\n(Goffman 1983a: 14) 140 Understanding pragmatics\nWhen customers enter a \u2018service arena\u2019 it is in their own interest to find out as soon as\npossible how the \u2018local tracking system\u2019 works. Do they have to take a numbered slip from\na machine? Do they have to join a queue? Must they monitor the persons who are already\npresent as well as the person who enters the scene just after them? If multiple servers take\ncare of sub-queues, they have to find out in which sub-queue they are and who will look\nafter them. If their place in such a queue is respected, other queuers will have to respect the\ngeneral queuing discipline, even if they may have special relationships with the server.\nSecond, Goffman points out that in these transactions people who are seeking\nservice can expect that each of them\nwill be treated with courtesy, for example, that the server will give quick attention to\nthe service request, and execute it with words, gestures, and manner that somehow\ndisplay approval of the asker and pleasure in the contact. Implied (when taken in\nconjunction with the equality principle) is that a customer who makes a very small\npurchase will be given no less a reception than one who makes a very large one.\n(Goffman 1983a: 14f.)\nHowever, besides these two rules there are many other issues that are relevant in\nservice transactions. There are conditions, for example, a person must meet to qualify\nfor a candidate for service, like, for example, \u2018[s]ituationally perceptible qualifications\nregarding age, sobriety, language ability, and solvency\u2019 (Goffman 1983a: 15). Not all\nservice transactions require that the server and the person(s) served have eye-contact\n(see below) \u2013 that is why Goffman prefers to speak of service transactions and not of\nservice encounters. However, he points out that in these transactions\n[t]he standard arrangement ... is for eyes to meet, the mutual obligation of a social\nencounter accepted, and civil titles used ... in the initial interchange, typically in\nutterance-initial or utterance-terminal position. In our society, this means a gender-\nmarked vocative and a tinting of behavior that is thought to be suitable for the gender\nmix in the transaction ... If served is a pre-adult, then this too is likely to be reflected in\nserver\u2019s vocative selection and \u201cspeech register\u201d.\n(Goffman 1983a: 15)\nServer and served may also know each other by name and may have had a prior\nrelationship. If this is the case,\nthen the transaction is likely to be initiated and terminated by a relationship ritual:\nindividually identifying terms of address are likely to be used along with the exchange\nof inquiry and well-wishing found in standard greetings and farewells between\nacquaintances. So long as these initial and terminal flurries of sociability are sustained\nas a subordinate involvement during the transaction, so long as other persons present\ndo not feel their movement in the queue is being impeded, then no sense of intrusion\ninto the application of equalitarian treatment is likely to be sensed. The management\nof personal relationships is thus bracketed.\n(Goffman 1983a: 15) Pragmatics and sociology 141\nGoffman points out that \u2018all the various elements in the standard structure of\nserving can be ... breached in almost an infinite number of ways\u2019. However, when this\nis done, it is done in \u2018the form of deniable acts\u2019 which can be disputed if the actors are\nchallenged openly (Goffman 1983a: 15).\nGoing to the cinema and buying tickets is another scenario with which Goffman\nillustrates his approach to researching interaction. If one goes with one\u2019s partner to the\nmovies, one goes to a ticket window, takes money out of one\u2019s purse and says to the\nticket seller: \u2018Two please\u2019. With this elliptic utterance one indicates that one wants\ntickets \u2013 and given the situation the ticket seller is completely aware of this, despite the\ninformation-wise rather underspecified utterance addressed to her or him. Goffman\nnotes that the ticket seller appreciates that s/he was not asked to \u2018give\u2019 the customer the\ntickets, \u2018but to exchange them for money\u2019. This interaction requires no \u2018prior state of\ntalk\u2019. If one approaches the ticket window one has \u2018a right to start flat out with words\nregarding tickets\u2019. The job of the person who sells the tickets obliges him or her to\n\u2018make sense out of cryptic utterances regarding tickets\u2019 because of the institutionalized\nservice arrangement which s/he is part of. Goffman points out that the whole\ntransaction of buying tickets at a movie can be carried out without an exchange of\nwords and even without eye-contact (Goffman 1983b: 34f.). With examples like this\nGoffman supports his observation that\nthe general constraint that an utterance must satisfy, namely, that it connects acceptably\nwith what recipient has in, or can bring to, mind, applies in a manner to non-linguistic\nacts in wordless contexts ... [W]henever we come into contact with another ... we find\nourselves with one central obligation: to render our behavior understandably relevant\nto what the other can come to perceive is going on. Whatever else, our activity must be\naddressed to the other\u2019s mind, that is, to the other\u2019s capacity to read our words and\nactions for evidence of our feelings, thoughts and intent. This confines what we say and\ndo, but it also allows us to bring to bear all of the world to which the other can catch\nallusions.\n(Goffman 1983b: 50f.)\nTo sum up: Goffman\u2019s interaction research provided deep insights into the complex\nstructural properties of human interaction in social situations. Social interaction is a\nsocial institution with its own rules and orders that constitute a \u2018syntax\u2019 which regulates\ninteractional rights and obligations. Goffman showed that these rules \u2013 which also\ncontrol the order of actions in interaction \u2013 are based on the social order constitutive\nfor the interactants\u2019 community. Interactions are rooted in, and dependent on, specific\ncontexts and create (new) contexts at the same time. Participants in co-present\ninteraction permanently monitor and analyse each other\u2019s forms of behaviour; they\nmake inferences regarding their own and the other\u2019s motivations, intentions and self-\npresentation, and they frame their encounters and permanently negotiate/renegotiate,\nconstruct/reconstruct and frame/reframe their roles as well as the interaction situation\nduring these encounters, thus affirming and protecting their dignity \u2013 their face \u2013 to\nmaintain the ritual and moral order of social life. 142 Understanding pragmatics\n5.3 HAROLD GARFINKEL\u2019S ETHNOMETHODOLOGY\nHarold Garfinkel, one of Goffman\u2019s colleagues and friends, also investigated the social\norder, the sociology of daily life. He did so, however, in a specific framework for which\nhe coined the label \u2018ethnomethodology\u2019. He defined his approach as follows:\nI use the term ethnomethodology to refer to various policies, methods, results, risks,\nand lunacies with which to locate and accomplish the study of the rational properties\nof practical actions as contingent ongoing accomplishments of organized artful\npractices of everyday life.\n(Garfinkel 1972: 309)\nHe emphasized that ethnomethodology is\nconcerned with the question of how, over the temporal course of their actual\nengagements, and \u2018knowing\u2019 the society only from within, members produce stable,\naccountable practical activities, i.e., social structures of everyday activities.\n(Garfinkel 1967: 185)\nAnd he characterizes ethnomethodological studies as studies that analyse\neveryday activities as members\u2019 methods for making those same activities visibly-\nrational-and-reportable-for-all-practical-purposes, i.e., \u201caccountable\u201d, as organizations\nof commonplace everyday activities. The reflexivity of that phenomenon is a singular\nfeature of practical actions, of practical circumstances, of common sense knowledge of\nsocial structures, and of practical sociological reasoning. By permitting us to locate and\nexamine their occurrence the reflexivity of that phenomenon establishes their study.\n(Garfinkel 1967: vii)\nThus, like Goffman, Garfinkel focuses his research on how ordinary members of a\nsociety or community use \u2018taken-for-granted, commonsense practices\u2019 (Firth 2009: 67) as\nmeans and (ethno)methods of practical reasoning to constitute, understand and make\nshared sense not only of the common context and the specific circumstances of their\nactions, but also of their social order, i.e. their social world. In doing so they heavily rely\non the \u2018reflexive relation between the \u201cfacts\u201d about society and the ways ... [they] use\npractical reasoning and commonsense knowledge to depict society\u2019 (Psathas 1994: 1162).\nGarfinkel\u2019s approach will be illustrated with four of his and his students\u2019 studies:\nIn a study on procedures followed for coding patients in a psychiatric clinic, for\nexample, Garfinkel wanted to investigate how people who work in the clinic do these\ncodings and how students examine the codings. Garfinkel (1972: 311) and his students\ndemonstrated that the coders in the clinic \u2018were assuming knowledge of the very\norganized ways of the clinic that their coding procedures were intended to produce\ndescriptions of\u2019. Obviously this \u2018presupposed knowledge\u2019 was necessary for the coders\nto be satisfied with their categorizations made during the actual coding situations and Pragmatics and sociology 143\nto be convinced that their coding results represented \u2018what really happened\u2019. But what\ndid the coders actually do when they were made to follow the coding instructions?\nGarfinkel and his co-workers started from the assumption that \u2018whatever they did\ncould be counted correct procedure in some coding game\u2019. Their task then was to find\nout how the coders played what kind of game to get the coding results documented in\nthe folders. Garfinkel presents these results as follows:\nWe soon found the essential relevance to the coders of such considerations as: \u201cet\ncetera,\u201d \u201cunless,\u201d \u201clet it pass,\u201d and \u201cfactum valet.\u201d3\nFor convenience call these considerations \u201cad hoc\u201d, and call their use in the coder\u2019s\nwork of interrogating contents for answers to their questions \u201cad hocing\u201d. Coders used\nthese same ad hoc considerations in order to recognize the relevance of the coding\ninstructions to the organized activities of the clinic. Only when this relevance was clear\nwere the coders satisfied that the coding instructions did analyze actually encountered\nfolder contents in such a way as to permit the coders to treat folder contents as reports\nof \u201creal events\u201d.\n(Garfinkel 1972: 312)\nThat is to say, the coders followed coding rules and coding instructions; however, they\nadapted them so that they made sense in specific cases, that is to say that they fitted the\ngiven data. With this study Garfinkel rejected Talcott Parsons\u2019 idea \u2018that rules \u201ccause\u201d\nor \u201cexplain\u201d behavior\u2019; instead, he emphasized \u2018the inherent \u201clooseness\u201d and\n\u201cresourcefulness\u201d of rules\u2019 and he \u2018demonstrated that their use in actual settings was\nempirically researchable as a topic in its own right\u2019 (Firth 2009: 70).\nIn another experiment Garfinkel (1972: 316) asked students to \u2018report common\nconversation by writing on the left side of a sheet what the parties actually said and on\nthe right side what they and their partners understood that they were talking about\u2019. It\nturned out that the students found the task impossible. Gumperz and Hymes\nsummarize Garfinkel\u2019s interpretation of this result as follows:\n[The students] took the task to be one of remedying the sketchiness of the conversation\nby elaborating its contents, by appealing outside the speech event to what became,\nunder prodding, an infinite regress of context. Their error was to assume a theory of\nsigns in which the way something is said is divorced from what is being said ..., and in\nconcentrating on the \u201cwhat\u201d, neglecting the \u201chow\u201d. In fact, the conversation (like any\nconversation) was an instance of one or more alternative ways of speaking; it was\nintelligible to its participants not because of some shared infinity of substantive\nknowledge as to what is being talked about but in the first instance because they agreed\nat the time on how the talking was being done and how it was to be interpreted. The\nfact that such momentary agreements can be reached, however, does not mean that\ncontent can be reconstructed later under different conditions.\n(Gumperz and Hymes 1972: 303)\nThis experiment supports the idea put forward by Garfinkel (1967: 4ff.) and Garfinkel\nand Sacks (1970) that not only deictic expressions (see Chapter Two) but all linguistic 144 Understanding pragmatics\nactions are indexical. With the notion of indexicality Garfinkel \u2018refers to the fact that\nfor members, the meaning of what they say and do is dependent on the context in\nwhich their doing and saying occurs\u2019 (Psathas 1994: 1161). Firth points out that for\nGarfinkel\nunderstanding is accomplished not on the basis of pre-established shared meanings,\nbut procedurally and contextually \u2013 in that what is said [and done, G. S.] is invariably\nassessed in a particular, local context, by particular persons, at a particular moment.\n(Firth 2009: 71)\nIn his famous \u2018breaching experiments\u2019 Garfinkel instructed students \u2018to engage an\nacquaintance or friend in an ordinary conversation and, without indicating that what\nthe experimenter was saying was in any way out of the ordinary, to insist that the\nperson clarify the sense of his commonplace remarks\u2019 (Garfinkel 1963: 220ff.). Two\nsuch interactions are reported here (see Garfinkel 1967: 42 and 44):\nInteraction 1:\nThe subject was telling the experimenter, a member of the subject\u2019s car pool, about\nhaving had a flat tire while going to work the previous day.\nS: I had a flat tire.\nE: What do you mean, you had a flat tire?\nShe appeared momentarily stunned, then she answered in a hostile way:\n\u2018What do you mean? What do you mean? A flat tire is a flat tire. That is what I\nmeant. What a crazy question!\u2019\nInteraction 2:\nThe victim waved his hand cheerily.\nS: How are you?\nE: How am I in regard to what? My health, my finance, my school work, my\npeace of mind, my...\nS: (Red in face and suddenly out of control.)\nI was just trying to be polite. Frankly I don\u2019t give a damn how you are.\nGarfinkel\u2019s (1967: 36f.) explicit aim with these experiments was to make \u2018commonplace\nscenes visible\u2019 by starting \u2018with familiar scenes\u2019 and then \u2018make trouble\u2019. With the\nexperiments he made the students breach Alfred Sch\u00fctz\u2019s (1962) \u2018idealization of the\ncongruency of relevance\u2019 that contributes to making up his \u2018general thesis of reciprocal\nperspective\u2019. Heritage summarizes the results of these experiments as follows:\nthe subjects had expected that the experimenters would be drawing upon background\nknowledge of \u2018what everybody knows\u2019, supply a sense to their remarks that was\n\u2018empirically identical\u2019 with the sense intended by the [subjects]. The [subject] thus\nassumed, in each case, that both parties knew \u2018what he is talking about without any\nrequirement of a check-out\u2019 (Garfinkel 1963: 220). In each case, the [subject] took for\ngranted that the [experimenter] would supply whatever unstated understandings Pragmatics and sociology 145\nwould be required in order to make recognizable sense of his talk. This requirement\n... pervades all interaction ... It is noticeable that the [experimenters\u2019] breaches of this\nrequirement resulted in interactional breakdowns which were extraordinarily rapid\nand complete ... Moreover, ... the [experimenters\u2019] breaches were very rapidly and\npowerfully sanctioned ... [T]he [subject] treated the intelligible character of his own\ntalk as something to which he was morally entitled and, correspondingly, treated the\nbreaching move as illegitimate, deserving of sanction and requiring explanation.\nThe experiment thus indicated that maintaining \u2018reciprocity of perspectives\u2019 (as one\nof the presuppositions of the attitude of daily life) is not merely a cognitive task, but\none which each actor \u2018trusts\u2019 that the other will accomplish as a matter of moral\nnecessity.\n(Heritage 1984: 81f.)\nThus, these experiments revealed that \u2018interactants hold themselves and one another\nmorally accountable for the \u201caccommodative work\u201d through which they make sense\nof their circumstances\u2019 (Heritage 1984: 84).\nIn a student counselling experiment, undergraduates were told to describe a\nproblem they had and to ask the counsellor questions about it; the students were told\nthat they had to design their questions as yes/no questions. The counsellor and the\nstudents were situated in adjoining rooms, connected by intercom. After every\nquestion/answer sequence the students were asked to switch off their intercom and\nto tape-record their reflections on the counsellor\u2019s answer. What the students did\nnot know was that the counsellor gave his/her answers according to a random\nschedule. Nevertheless, it turned out that the students tried their very best to\ninterpret the advice given as coherent answers to their questions given by a motivated\ncounsellor (Garfinkel 1967: 76ff.). With this experiment Garfinkel wanted to\nillustrate his notion of the \u2018documentary method of interpretation\u2019 which he defined\nas consisting of\ntreating an actual appearance as \u201cthe document of\u201d, as \u201cpointing to\u201d, as \u201cstating on\nbehalf of\u201d a presupposed underlying pattern ... The method is recognizable for the\neveryday necessities of recognizing what a person is \u201ctalking about\u201d given that he does\nnot say exactly what he means.\n(Garfinkel 1967: 78)\nThus, the documentary method provides interactants with the basis for the shared\nunderstanding of their actions. Firth points out that in this study the\n\u2018documentary method of interpretation\u2019 is one resource that enabled the students to\nmake sense of otherwise incoherent actions. This \u2018method\u2019 and the ... notion of the\n\u2018natural attitude\u2019 ... are claimed to permeate all acts of mundane perception and\ncognition ... Garfinkel maintains that the \u2018natural attitude\u2019 is part of a member\u2019s\n\u2018commonsense assumptions\u2019 that underpin social interaction and the \u2018accommodative\nwork\u2019 which the interaction necessitates. The assumptions include: 146 Understanding pragmatics\n1. Searching for a normal form ... [W]hen discrepancies and/or ambiguities appear,\npeople suspend doubt and search for an assumed \u2018normal form\u2019 that would account\nfor the discrepancies.\n2. Doing the reciprocity of perspectives. This entails sustaining the assumption that\neach participant would have the same experiences if they were to change places.\n3. Employing the et cetera principle. This assumption entails participants filling in\n(observedly \u2018missing\u2019) information during social activities; in this way, participants\nlet unclarities and anomalies \u2018pass\u2019 in the belief that they will be subsequently\nclarified ...\n(Firth 2009: 74f.)\nGarfinkel made at least three fundamental contributions to the study of social\ninteraction:\nFirst, he put the focus of this enterprise on practical commonsense knowledge which\nprovides interactants with the basis for understanding their actions in their social\nworld \u2013 their social order. Individuals, or members \u2013 in Garfinkel\u2019s terminology \u2013 use\ncommonsense practices as shared ethnomethods of practical reasoning to constitute,\nand at the same time to make shared sense of and understand, their actions and their\nsocial world. Gumperz and Hymes point out that for Garfinkel\n[i]t is these modes of reasoning that should be the first order business in social research.\nThe basis of culture, Garfinkel suggests, is not shared knowledge but shared rules of\ninterpretation; not common substantive information, already acquired, but \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d knowledge of what can count as reasonable, factual, related, and the like.\n(Gumperz and Hymes 1972: 304)\nSecond, in doing so, Garfinkel pointed out \u2018the constitutive role of cognition in the\norganisation of social activities\u2019 by showing that interactants strive for accomplishing\nshared understanding procedurally and contextually, that they take their mutual\nefforts to reach this aim as a matter of moral necessity and that they use the documentary\nmethod of interpretation as a resource for making sense of seemingly incoherent\nactions (see Firth 2009: 93).\nAnd third, in doing this he described \u2018the local, contingent and reflexive \u201cwork\u201d\nthrough which concrete social settings, identities and activities are rendered\nrecognizable and meaningful\u2019 (Firth 2009: 94). Gumperz and Hymes assess this as the\nfundamental contention of Garfinkel\u2019s work: \u2018the orderliness, rationality, accountability\nof everyday life is, as he puts it, a \u201ccontingent, ongoing accomplishment\u201d, a kind of\n\u201cwork\u201d or \u201cdoing\u201d\u2019 (Gumperz and Hymes 1972: 304).\n5.4 HARVEY SACKS AND CONVERSATION ANALYSIS\nHarvey Sacks was a student \u2013 and later a colleague \u2013 of both Goffman and Garfinkel.\nGarfinkel closely cooperated for an extended period with Sacks; they even published\ntogether (Garfinkel and Sacks 1970). Influenced by these two scholars, especially by Pragmatics and sociology 147\ntheir studies on practical reasoning, on the sequential ordering of actions, on\ninteractional units as well as on talk in face-to-face interactions and the interactants\u2019\nbehaviour in conversation, Sacks developed the field of \u2018Conversation Analysis\u2019 (from\nhere on abbreviated as CA) in close cooperation with Emanuel A. Schegloff and Gail\nJefferson (see Schegloff 1992: xv, xxiii). This subsection presents the CA approach and\nsome of its crucial aspects and insights.\nIn one of his papers Sacks explains what kinds of methodological considerations\nwere responsible for his decision to study tape-recorded conversations:\nWhen I started to do research in sociology I figured that sociology could not be an\nactual science unless it was able to handle the details of actual events, handle them\nformally, and in the first instance be informative about them in the direct ways in\nwhich primitive sciences tend to be informative, that is, that anyone else can go and see\nwhether what was said is so. And that is a tremendous control on seeing whether one\nis learning anything. So the question was, could there be some way that sociology\ncould hope to deal with the details of actual events, formally and informatively? ... I\nwanted to locate some set of materials that would permit a test. ... It was not from any\nlarge interest in language or from some theoretical formulation of what should be\nstudied that I started with tape-recorded conversation, but simply because I could get\nmy hands on it and I could study it again and again, and also, consequentially, because\nothers could look at what I had studied and make of it what they could, if, for example,\nthey wanted to be able to disagree with me.\n(Sacks 1984: 26)\nHe was convinced that studying conversations \u2013 the actual and basic naturally\noccurring forms of language use in specific situations and contexts \u2013 would provide\nnot only important insights into the \u2018details of actual events\u2019, but also into the speakers\u2019\npractical commonsense knowledge and reasoning manifest in their conversational\npractices. Among the first conversation data Sacks studied were recordings of phone\ncalls to the Suicide Prevention Center in Los Angeles. His repeated analyses of these\nand other more ordinary telephone calls confirmed his hypothesis that \u2018ordinary\nconversation [is] a deeply ordered, structurally organized phenomenon\u2019 (Clift et al.\n2009: 40). These first analyses focused on the systematics of the organization of turn-\ntaking for conversation in which the speakers co-construct meaning and social action,\non how speakers manage to regulate who is speaking next and when and on the\nsequential order of social actions and activities during conversation. The following\ngeneral features observed in conversations are crucial for the CA approach (see Sacks\net al. 1974: 700ff.):\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The number of speakers involved in a conversation varies and speaker-change\ntakes place.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Usually one party talks at a time; however, it is also common that more than one\ninteractant speak at a time, but these occurrences are rather brief.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Speakers try to avoid overlaps and to minimize gaps between turns. 148 Understanding pragmatics\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Turn order and turn size vary.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The length of a conversation, what parties say and the distribution of turns is not\nspecified in advance.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Talk can be continuous or discontinuous.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Speakers use \u2018turn-allocation techniques\u2019, e.g. a current speaker may select a next\nspeaker or parties involved in the conversation may \u2018self-select\u2019 in starting to talk.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Turns consist of \u2018turn-constructional units (TCUs)\u2019 like, e.g. a word, a clause, or\none or more sentences that are recognized by their interactants as meaningful. At\nthe end of a TCU a next speaker may take a turn or the current speaker may\nproduce a next TCU. That is to say, ends of TCUs are not only \u2018turn-completion\npoints\u2019 (TCPs), but also \u2018transition-relevance places (TRPs)\u2019.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Problems that arise during speaking, hearing and understanding can be repaired\nby interactants in a conversation.\nSacks and his colleagues Schegloff and Jefferson illustrated and discussed these\nobservations in their seminal 1974 paper on turn-taking in conversation with which\nthey established CA as a subdiscipline of sociology in its own right. David Logue and\nTanya Stivers characterize this subdiscipline as follows:\nAs a theory of social interaction, Conversation Analysis holds that conversation is built\nout of sequences of actions. As such, language is not fundamentally concerned with\n\u2018meaning\u2019 but with implementing actions such as greeting, requesting, offering,\ninviting, complimenting, chastizing and insulting. Moreover, the theory asserts that\npeople produce and recognize each other\u2019s social actions via a norm-governed system.\nInsofar as social interaction is norm-governed, people are expected to hold one another\naccountable for violations of these norms.\n(Logue and Stivers 2012: 1285)\nConversation analysts base their studies on audio- and video-recordings of naturally\noccurring conversations of almost all kinds4 which they transcribe as minutely and\ncarefully as possible, using a specifically developed transcription system (see, e.g.\nHeritage and Clayman 2010: 283ff.; Jefferson 2004)\nwhich is intended to capture in fine detail the temporal production of talk ... the\ncharacteristics of the sequencing of turns, including gaps, pauses, and overlaps; and\nelements of speech delivery such as audible breath and laughter, stress, enunciation,\nintonation and pitch, all of which have been shown to have interactional import ...\n[T]ranscripts aim to provide a detailed but accessible rendering of those features that\n... prove to be the most relevant for analyzing the methods by which participants\nconcertedly accomplish orderly and intelligible social interaction ... [T]ranscripts are\navailable for inspection alongside the analyses themselves.\n(Clift et al. 2009: 43) Pragmatics and sociology 149\nThe following excerpt (1) from such a transcript (from Sacks et al. 1974: 702) illustrates\nsome aspects of this transcription system:\n(1) Jeannette: Oh you know, Mittie- Gordon, eh- Gordon, Mittie\u00b4s husband died.\n(0.3)\nEstelle: Oh whe::n.\nJeannette: Well it was in the paper this morning.\nEstelle: It wa::s,\n\u2192 Jeannette: Yeah.\nIn this example underscoring indicates stressing, colons indicate prolongation, the\nnumbers in brackets indicate the length of a pause (in this case, 0.3 seconds) and the\narrow marks the line of interest for the analysis, in this example the start of a next\nspeaker after a turn composed of a single word with no gap between the turns.\nThe observation that there is no, or only a very brief, gap between turns can especially\nbe made in so-called adjacency pairs (Schegloff and Sacks 1973: 295), sequential units\nlike, e.g. \u2018question\u2013answer\u2019, greeting\u2013greeting\u2019, \u2018offer\u2013acceptance/refusal\u2019, \u2018invitation\u2013\nacceptance/decline\u2019, which achieve this close ordering. Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson\n(1974) inferred from this precise temporal alignment of turns that speakers (at least\nspeakers of English) must anticipate the end of a speaker\u2019s turn, because the next\nspeaker\u2019s preparation for articulating his or her turn requires some time. But what\nabout speakers of other languages?\nPsycholinguistic analyses of a corpus \u2013 or, in CA methodological terms, a collection\n\u2013 of Dutch two-party telephone conversations revealed that in 45 per cent of all speaker\ntransitions the time between the end of a turn of a speaker and the start of a new turn\nof a next speaker, the so-called \u2018FLOOR TRANSFER OFFSET (FTO)\u2019 varies between\n\u2013250 and 250 ms; 85 per cent of all speaker transitions have an FTO of \u2013750 and\n750 ms.5 Thus, there are indeed only minimal gaps and overlaps in speaker transitions\nduring conversation. This confirms \u2018that listeners do not wait until they DETECT the\nend of a speaker\u2019s turn; rather, they ANTICIPATE this moment\u2019 (de Ruiter et al. 2006:\n516f.).\nSome researchers have suggested that this ability to \u2018PROJECT the moment of\ncompletion of a current speaker\u2019s turn\u2019 is based on lexicosyntactic cues, others argue\nthat prosodic features, especially intonation contours are decisive for this ability. These\nhypotheses were tested in an online experiment in which the \u2018presence of symbolic\n(lexicosyntactic) content and intonational contour of utterances recorded in natural\n[Dutch] conversations\u2019 was manipulated (de Ruiter et al. 2006: 515). Subjects were\npresented with natural words and no-words stimuli as well as with verbal stimuli\nwhere intonational contours were removed; then they were asked \u2018to press a button ...\nat the moment they thought the speaker would be finishing speaking\u2019 (de Ruiter et al.\n2006: 523). They were encouraged to try to anticipate this moment. The results of these\nexperiments are summarized as follows:\nWhen hearing the original recordings, subjects can anticipate turn endings with the\nsame degree of accuracy attested in real conversation. With intonational contour 150 Understanding pragmatics\nentirely removed (leaving intact words and syntax, with a completely flat pitch) there\nis no change in subjects\u2019 accuracy of end-of-turn projection. But in the opposite case\n(with original intonational contour intact, but with no recognizable words) subjects\u2019\nperformance deteriorates significantly. These results establish that the symbolic (i.e.\nlexicosyntactic) content of an utterance is necessary (and possibly sufficient) for\nprojecting the moment of its completion, and thus for regulating conversational turn-\ntaking. By contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, intonational contour is neither necessary\nnor sufficient for end-of-turn projection.\n(de Ruiter et al. 2006: 515)\nJan Peter de Ruiter and his colleagues point out that their experiments show that\ngrammar \u2018is not just a means for semantic representation of predicate-argument\nrelations\u2019, but also \u2018an inherent temporal resource for listeners to chart out the course\nof the speaker\u2019s expression and to plan their own speech accordingly\u2019. Speakers exploit\nlexicosyntactic options available in specific contexts of speech to \u2018actively foreshadow\nstructure, thereby manipulating the unfolding course of the interaction itself, and\nliterally controlling the interlocutor\u2019s processes of cognition and action\u2019. This supports\nthe hypothesis that language is \u2018structurally DESIGNED FOR strategic deployment in\nsocial interaction\u2019 (de Ruiter et al. 2006: 532).\nCA research results \u2013 like the findings and observations reported so far \u2013 more or\nless explicitly claim to be valid for all languages. Is there any support for such a\nuniversal claim of CA, given the fact that most research so far has been done on\nEnglish? Recently another group of scholars (Stivers et al. 2009) researched question\u2013\nanswer adjacency pairs across ten languages (Danish, Italian, Dutch, English,\nJapanese, Lao, Korean, Tzeltal, Hai//om, Y\u00e9l\u00ee-Dnye). Research in CA has shown that\nwe can differentiate between preferred and dispreferred answers in question-\nresponse systems in many (if not all) languages. Preferred answers to questions\nexpress agreement and they are delivered more quickly than dispreferred answers\n(see Enfield et al. 2010: 2616). Example (2) from Danish (Heinemann 2010: 2722)\nillustrates such a preferred answer (note the code switch to English after the first\nDanish answer \u2018MJah\u2019):\n(2) Line: \u21921 Ska\u2019 vi ta\u2019 det her med?\nShall we take this here with\nShould we take this with us?\nMette: \u21922 >.mJah.< .fnnt Let\u2019s do that.\n>.mPRT.< .fnnt Let\u2019s do that.\n>.mYes.< .fnnt Let\u2019s do that.\nResponses to questions that disconfirm and disagree are dispreferred actions which\ntend to be delayed and mitigated and they may sometimes be pursued for\nreconfirmation. Example (3) from Tzeltal (Brown 2010: 2646) illustrates such a\ndispreferred answer: Pragmatics and sociology 151\n(3) A: eej lek me ay-\u00d8 in ch\u2019i j-tatik-\neh good if EXIST-3ABS DEIC PT HON-\u2019sir\u2019\nay-\u00d8 ya x-ala ba-at ya\u2019tik tz\u2019in\nEXIST-3ABS INC ASP-DIM go-2A today PT\nE h it\u2019s good if that\u2019s the case, sir, is there somewhere you are going to go\nnow?\n(0.3)\nN: ma\u2019yuk- DISCONFIRMING ANSWER\nNo(where)\nA: ma\u2019yuk-ix a [tz\u2019in PURSUIT OF RECONFIRMATION\nNone=ACS DEIC PT\nThere\u2019s no(where) then.\nN: [ma\u2019yuk. CONFIRMATION\nNo(where).\nThe study of Stivers et al. (2009) restricted itself to the comparison of polar (yes\u2013no)\nquestions, the commonest type of questions in nine of the ten languages researched.\nThe study of de Ruiter and his colleagues presented above which \u2018analysed a corpus of\nDutch conversation ... for timing across all types of turns and responses ... found no\ndifferences between response times after questions and nonquestions\u2019; therefore the\nresearchers in this project took the question-response sequences to be analysed as\nrepresentative for turn-taking in general. Their study confirmed that turn-taking in\nconversation follows a \u2018minimal-gap minimal overlap\u2019 norm and supports the\nassumption that turn-taking is \u2018a universal system with minimal cultural variability\u2019\n(Stivers et al. 2009: 10587f.):\n[T]he response timings for each language ... have a unimodal distribution with a mode\noffset for each language between 0 and +200 ms, and an overall mode of 0 ms. The\nmedians are also quite uniform, ranging from 0 ms (English, Japanese, Tzeltal and Y\u00e9l\u00ee\nDnye) to +300 (Danish, Hai//om, Lao) ... The means display somewhat more variation\n... Danish has the slowest response time on average (+469 ms) and Japanese has the\nfastest (+7 ms). The mean response offset for the full dataset is +208 ms, and the\nlanguage-specific means fall within \u2248250 ms either side of this cross-language mean,\napproximately the length of time it takes to produce a single English syllable ...\n(Stivers et al. 2009: 10587f.)\nThe differences in the response times are pragmatically explained: \u2018A speaker of Danish\navoids silence just as a speaker of Japanese avoids silence, but silence happens faster in\nJapanese than in Danish\u2019 (Stivers: p.c.), or, in more scientific terms, \u2018what constitutes a\nsubjectively notable delay involves greater absolute duration in some languages than in\nothers\u2019 (Stivers et al. 2009: 10590). These slight differences seem to be culturally calibrated,\nso to speak. In addition, the study showed that answers are produced faster and more 152 Understanding pragmatics\noften than responses that do not answer the question (like, for example, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 or\n\u2018I can\u2019t remember\u2019). Confirmations are also produced faster and more often than\ndisconfirmations (between 100 and 500 ms on average) \u2013 these findings confirm the\ndistinction between preferred and dispreferred answers. Visible responses, like head\nnods, head shakes, shrugs, eye blinks and eyebrow flashes were even faster than speech,\nhowever, the researchers observed substantial variation in how frequently such responses\nwere included in a response. In nine of the ten languages responses were given faster\nwhen speakers were looking at the person to whom they addressed the question, however,\nthe variation in how often questioners gazed at addressees suggests that \u2018gaze may be\nmore culturally variable than other behaviors\u2019 (Stivers et al. 2009: 10588). The overall\nresult that \u2018responses tend to be neither in overlap nor delayed by more than half a second\u2019\nseems to capture \u2018a universal feature of the interactional systems that underlie the use of\nlanguages\u2019 (Stivers et al. 2009: 10590).\nAt transition-relevance places speakers can either decide to keep the floor and start\na new turn-constructional unit6 or they can select a next speaker or they just can end\ntheir turn giving another interlocutor the chance to self-select him- or herself as next\nspeaker. Excerpt (4) from Japanese (Tanaka 1999: 46) illustrates a case of speaker\nselection of next speaker:\n(4) M: (looking at T)\n... yappari kan ga ii n desu yo ne::\nafter all intuition NOMP good NMLZ COP FP FP\n... \u2019after all, ((you)) have a good sense of intuition\u2019\nMinasan no baai\nyou ((plural)) P case\n\u2018in the case of people like you\u2019\ndakara (.) .hh\n\u2018therefore\u2019\nshize::n ni wakatte [kite\nnaturally P come to understand\n\u2018((it)) just comes naturally\u2019\n[\nT: [Iya mendokusai da dake (hh) to iu oh\n[no bothersome DF only QUOTP say DF\n[\u2018No, it\u2019s just that ((I)) can\u2019t be bothered\u2019\nS: hhh\nIn this example participants have been talking about T and his ability to operate a\ncomputer without reading the manual with instructions. Tanaka (1999: 46) explains\nwhich next speaker selection techniques M is using and what is going on here:\nM selects T as next speaker, both through her gaze direction (addressing device) and\nby complimenting the latter on his superior sense of intuition (the first pair part of an Pragmatics and sociology 153\nadjacency pair compliment / acceptance or rejection). T responds immediately, in this\ncase by less favourably reformulating the activity referred to.\nExample (5) from Guyanese Creole illustrates \u2018turn-initial overlap\u2019 (marked with a\nbracket [ ) because \u2018a next-speaker has not been selected by the previous turn in line 2\nand both Pank and Nancy self-select\u2019 themselves \u2018at a recognizable transition-relevance\nplace\u2019 as next speaker (Sidnell 2001: 1273):\n(5) 1. Pank: suna narai dadii. en= Suna is Narain\u2019s father. And=\n2. John: =shot yoo ass:. =Shut your ass\n3. Pank:\u2192 joo suna Joe Suna,\n[\n4.Nancy:\u2192 joo. yea Joe. Yes\n5. Joo a harii da Joe is Harry Suna\u2019s father\n[ [\n6. Pank Harri Harry\n7. Suna da Suna\u2019s father.\nSidnell interprets this excerpt as follows:\nHere Pank is making a claim about a genealogical link, and, after coming to a point of\npossible completion (recognizable by virtue of the prosody, the syntax and the content\nof the utterance) has begun to build an addition to the turn through the use of\nconjunctive en \u2018and\u2019. John\u2019s disagreement effectively forestalls any further contribution\nPank might make as an addition and creates an environment in which, upon its\npossible completion, a restatement of the claim or evidence of its veracity is expectably\ndue \u2013 the alternation of claim and disagreement sustaining the sense of the larger\ncourse of action as an argument. Both Nancy and Pank attempt to occupy the slot\nprovided for by John\u00b4s turn and thus produce a minimal overlap before Pank drops out\nallowing Nancy to recycle his turn beginning in the clear ...\n( Sidnell 2001: 1274)7\nSpeakers cannot only select next speaker or self-select themselves as next speakers,\ninteractants in a conversation can also repair \u2018troubles of speaking, hearing and\nunderstanding\u2019 (Sidnell 2009a: 3). These troubles are displayed in so-called \u2018trouble\nsource turns\u2019 (TST); this is usually done with a question (see Egbert 1997: 612). If\nspeakers realize that they have made a mistake, like having provided a wrong reference,\nthey can immediately or after some delay make a self-repair. Examples (6) and (7)\nillustrate a \u2018self repair in transition space\u2019 and a self-repair after a gap but \u2018just in time\nto pre-empt other-correction\u2019.

Pragmatics and sociology 157\nThis is an excerpt from a conversation between some inhabitants of a Thai-Lue\nvillage and the district officer (DO) about recordings of Lue folksongs. Moerman\n(1988: 20ff.) analyses it as follows: In lines 3, 6 and 8 the speaker S introduces the\nmissionary Acan B in whose house the recordings were made, and the artists, a singer\nand a piper. Thirty seconds later (line 32) the DO asked about the whereabouts of the\nsinger, his question is not immediately answered and so the DO continues his turn-\nconstructional unit with another repair initiating question (line 34) proposing a\npossible answer with his question. S informs him that the singer stays at the infirmary\nat Acan B\u2019s place. The speaker\u2019s repair (in line 35) initiates another repair with\nincreasing specificity in the question (in lines 37\u201339) asked by a village elder. S repeats\nhis earlier reference form together with a demonstrative, and after S\u2019s self-repair his\nwife adds (in an other-repair) the singer\u2019s eponym (in line 43) \u2013 \u2018the leper\u2019. Moerman\npoints out that many villagers have the same name, therefore eponyms \u2013 kind of\nnicknames \u2013 are often added to names to accomplish more specific person reference.\nHowever, in this case S immediately overlaps his wife\u2019s turn (in line 44) and corrects\nhis wife utterance that could be misunderstood as a medical diagnosis by the\ndownplaying and downgrading phrase \u2018He is sort of sick\u2019. With this turn S disagrees,\ndismisses and challenges his wife\u2019s turn, obscuring the eponym she used. Moerman\ninterprets S\u2019s turn as an obliterative overlap:\nWhen overlaps are obliterative, when, as here, one speaker clearly places his talk so as\nto blot out the talk of another, the intruder\u2019s precise placement discloses him to have\nbeen attending the talk he overlaps very closely indeed. It is not faulty listening or\nimperfect participation. The mechanical image is of pinpoint bombing, not careless\ncondition, of turns.\n(Moerman 1988: 21)\nMoerman provides the following ethnographic background information that explains\nand justifies S\u2019s intervention here. S is a client of the missionary who looks after and\nprotects the singer Noo, who has a harmless skin ailment, but not leprosy. S knows that\nsome people already have complained about Noo to the DO. If the DO would regard\nNoo as a true leper, he could remove him from the missionary\u2019s compound to a leper\ncolony. Thus, his wife\u2019s harmless person reference with an eponym could have had\nserious consequences.8 In the ongoing conversation S and his wife elaborate their\nreference to Noo (overlapping in lines 46 and 47), tell the DO more about Noo\u2019s\nwhereabouts and kin-relations and S finishes the sequence with the final neutral\nphrase \u2018That Ba Noo\u2019 (in line 50 which repeats line 42 again). Moerman comments on\nthis excerpt as follows:\nThe entire drama took less than ten seconds to perform. Its specifiable moves and units\nof action \u2013 turns, repairs, adjacency pairs, sequences \u2013 were conversationally organized.\nBut we never merely exchange turns of talk. In all conversation, people are living their\nlives, performing their roles, enacting their culture. The motives and meanings of all\ntalk are thick with culture. To understand what the moves mean requires (or recalls)\ncultural knowledge. The techniques and texture of conversation analysis precisely 158 Understanding pragmatics\nlocated the motivated, ongoing, actual operation of major social institutions. In \u201cThe\nLeper\u201d, naming practices, the authority of officials, loyalty to patrons, identificatory\nsocial memberships were momentarily and momentously invoked and enlivened. This\ndoes not mean that the social institutions and cultural patterns produced the talk. But\nthey are implicated in its meaning. The immediacy and complexity of every real social\nevent precludes producing, interpreting, or accounting for it by some single set of rules\n(like those for repair, turn-taking, loyalty, or kinship).\n(Moerman 1988: 22)\nIn addition to the ability of people engaged in conversation to make (other-initiated\nor self-) repairs, interlocutors can also manipulate the actions in the sequences of\nturns. Goodwin and Heritage (1990: 296) point out that Schegloff (1992: xxix)\nreferred to this ability with the term \u2018\u201cstrategic/sequential\u201d dimension of actions\u2019\nand elaborate as follows: \u2018This approach focuses on the ways alternative forms of an\naction shape the possibilities for different types of response, and on how these\nvarious forms can be manipulated to achieve specific outcomes\u2019. It was mentioned\nabove that CA differentiates between preferred and dispreferred responses. Excerpt\n(3) above illustrated a dispreferred response to a question. Excerpt (10) provided by\nSidnell (2010: 78f.) illustrates general features of dispreferred responses in more\ndetail:\n(10) 01 A Uh if you\u2019d care to come and visit a little while\n02 This morning I\u2019ll give you a cup of coffee.\n03 B hehh Well that\u2019s awfully sweet of you. I don\u2019t\n04 think I can make it this morning. .hh uhm I\u2019m\n05 running an ad in the paper and-and uh I have to\n06 stay near the phone\nSidnell (2010: 78f.) points out that in B\u2019s response we observe delays \u2018by prefacing the\nturn with audible breathing (\u201chehh\u201d) and \u201cwell\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s awfully sweet of you\u201d\u2019\n(line 3), palliatives, i.e. \u2018some kind of appreciation, apology and/or token agreement by\nwhich the ... \u201cnegative\u201d valence of the turn is mitigated\u2019 \u2013 in excerpt (10) these palliatives\nare the appreciation \u2018that\u2019s awfully sweet of you\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t think ...\u2019 (lines 3\u20134) \u2013 and\nthe explanation and justification for why the \u2018dispreferred response is being produced\u2019\n\u2013 in this case, why \u2018an invitation is being declined\u2019.\nAs Clift et al. point out, these\ndesign features of dispreferred responses can be used as a resource for the maintenance\nof social solidarity in talk-in-interaction ... [The] means of \u2018marking\u2019 a dispreferred\nresponse can provide a source for a first speaker to revise the original first pair-part in\nsuch a way as to try to avoid disagreement or rejection.\n(Clift et al. 2009: 49)\nThere are a number of means speakers can use to do this. So-called \u2018presequences\u2019 like\n\u2018Are you doing anything tonight?\u2019 preface actions like requests and invitations. As Pragmatics and sociology 159\nGoodwin and Heritage (1990: 297) point out, presequences \u2018enable parties to abort a\nprojected interaction sequence in which conflict, disagreement, or rejection might\nemerge ... [If] the projected sequence is not aborted in this way an affiliative outcome\n[i.e. agreement, acceptance, etc. (G. S.)] becomes highly likely\u2019. Excerpt (11) presented\nin Sidnell (2010: 80; see also Levinson 1983: 320) illustrates how a speaker treats a two\nsecond long silence after the preparation of a request as an indication of a dispreferred\nanswer and \u2018partially withdraws the (pre-)request by reversing the valence of the\nquestion with \u201cprobably not\u201d\u2019:\n(11) 01 So I was wondering would you be in your office\n02 on Monday (.) by any chance?\n03\u2192 (2s)\n04 Probably not.\nThe CA approach has researched a number of other phenomena, like openings and\nclosings of conversations, storytelling and narrative in conversations. However, this\nbrief overview can only deal with some of the topics that are constitutive for this\nparadigm. The research on turns (TCUs) and turn-taking, gaps and overlaps, repair,\nadjacency pairs and action organization or sequencing that are briefly sketched out\nhere illustrates that conversation is an emerging, yet highly orderly activity \u2018in which\nparticipants co-construct meaning and social action in an exquisitely timed\nchoreography of interlocking communicative moves\u2019, as Mark Dingemanse (p.c.)\nput it.\n5.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nJohn Heritage\u2019s appraisal of Schegloff provides a passage that succinctly summarizes\nthis chapter:\nGoffman insisted that social interaction is to be conceived as a social institution in its\nown right, with its own normative organization and moral obligations, which, in turn,\nare linked to other aspects of the social world through face, role and identity ... Goffman\nconceived social interaction as the product of a set of moral rights and rituals \u2013 a\n\u201csyntax\u201d as he once put it ... irreducible to individual psychology. It was this conception\nwhich ... mandated ... the study of social interaction \u2013 what Goffman ... later termed the\n\u201cinteraction order\u201d \u2013 as a subject matter in its own right.\nGarfinkel\u2019s researches developed the proposition ... that shared understanding and\nmutual intelligibility among humans are possible only through approximate, revisable\n... practical and shared methods of reasoning whose results are unavoidably inscribed\nin courses of social action. ...\nBuilding from these perspectives, CA focuses on the competencies which persons\nuse and rely on to co-construct orderly and mutually understandable courses of action.\nAccepting John Austin\u2019s supposition that we \u201cdo things with words\u201d, CA has developed\na program of research by mapping the resources with which members of the social 160 Understanding pragmatics\nworld produce, recognize, understand and manipulate social interactions. Its basic\nassumption is that while the resources for the construction of conduct are highly\ninstitutionalized ..., they also serve as the building blocks for highly particularized\ncourses of conduct, and for specifically meaningful activities fitted to the singular\ncharacteristics of particular persons and contexts.\n(Heritage 2003: 3)\nWhat does this chapter tell us about the anecdote reported in the introduction to this\nvolume? I was obviously unaware of the Trobriand Islanders\u2019 interaction order, its\nnormative organization and its moral obligations which coerce persons greeted with\nthe ritualized question Ambe? \u2013 \u2018Where are you going to?\u2019 to respond in the culturally\nappropriate way. My inadequate responses were forms of misbehaviour: I unwittingly\nand unwillingly did a breaching experiment, but this \u2018experiment\u2019 finally provided me\nwith the necessary inside knowledge of how to behave and react properly in this\ngreeting situation. Once I understood the Trobrianders\u2019 set of moral rights and rituals\nand had learned (about) their shared methods of reasoning, I could answer the question\nconstructing my turn in such a way that my response provided the information\nexpected by the persons who greeted me. Now the question-response adjacency pair\nwas co-constructed in an orderly and meaningful way within the frame of the\nTrobrianders\u2019 interaction order.\n5.6 EXERCISE/WORK SECTION\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Compare Eibl-Eibesfeldt\u2019s ideas about \u2018universal interaction strategies\u2019 with\nLevinson\u2019s \u2018interaction engine\u2019 and Goffman\u2019s \u2018interaction order\u2019.

In addition, this period of time is\nalso known as the \u2018Swinging Sixties\u2019 in which the young generation, in a kind of\ncultural revolution, radically changed the ways of living typical for the rather\nconservative 1950s. They abolished former taboos \u2013 especially with respect to\nsexuality and the rights of women \u2013 and questioned unlegitimized authority in all\npublic and private domains. This development was strongly influenced by Marxist\nideas and other ideologies of a so-called \u2018New Left\u2019 which tried to abolish social\ninequalities and overcome the social class structure in the Western capitalist\nsocieties. It was a decade of both an overall politicalization of private and public\nspheres and a liberalization and emancipation from so far unquestioned social\nnorms and other pressures towards social conformity \u2013 especially in the Western\nworld.\nThis prevailing political atmosphere had its reverberations in the scientific discourse,\ntoo, of course, especially within the humanities. Thus, it is no coincidence that this\ndecade saw the rise of sociolinguistics, which had its origins mainly in the Anglo-\nSaxon world with protagonists like, for example, Uriel Weinreich, Charles Ferguson,\nJoshua Fishman, Dell Hymes, John Gumperz, and William Labov. In the 1976\ntranslation of his monograph Sociolinguistics, Norbert Dittmar characterizes the\nstatus this discipline had gained as follows:\nIn the last decade sociolinguistics has become a powerful factor in promoting\nemancipation. Attempts have been made to attenuate conflicts in schools and to\nremove the obvious inequality of opportunity of broad sections of the working classes\nand peripheral social groups by systematically exposing the connection between\nspeech form and class structure, and by application of the insights gained to specific\nsocial contexts.\n(Dittmar 1976: 1) Pragmatics and politics 163\nAmong the most influential scholars within the field of sociolinguistics of this time\nwere the British sociologist and former teacher Basil Bernstein and the American\nlinguist William Labov.1\nBasil Bernstein developed a \u2018code theory\u2019 which was \u2018based on the claim that\nchildren and teachers from different class backgrounds spoke in different codes, and\nthat this produced ... a failure of communication\u2019 (Good 1999: 9). Bernstein\u2019s research\nhad not only political but also pedagogical consequences which resulted in so-called\n\u2018compensatory\u2019 education programmes. Despite the fact that Bernstein (1970a and b)\nhimself argued against these programmes, his code theory was characterized as a\n\u2018verbal deprivation theory\u2019 or \u2018deficit hypothesis\u2019 by scholars like Labov (1970a: 153),\nwho confronted it with sociolinguistic approaches that were referred to as the\n\u2018difference hypothesis\u2019 or as the \u2018variability concept\u2019.\nThe first part of this chapter presents a brief survey of Bernstein\u2019s code theory and\nLabov\u2019s variability concept and the controversy between the followers of these two\napproaches which had strong implications for linguistic pragmatics.\nThe discussion of Bernstein\u2019s and Labov\u2019s contributions to sociolinguistics illustrates\nhow linguistic research contributed to increase the researchers\u2019 awareness of the\npolitical impact of their studies. This observation is taken up in the second part of the\nchapter in which I discuss the topic of linguistic ideologies and their role for linguistic\npragmatics. After a brief discussion of the concept \u2013 based on Michael Silverstein\u2019s\n(1979) pioneering paper on \u2018Language structure and linguistic ideologies\u2019 and on Jef\nVerschueren\u2019s (2012) work Ideology in Language Use \u2013 three exemplary case studies of\nresearch on language ideologies will be presented.\n6.2 BASIL BERNSTEIN\u2019S CODE THEORY\nBernstein\u2019s code theory is a social theory which attempts to reveal the interrelationship\nbetween speech, socialization within the family, social class and school. In 1959 he\npublished a paper in which he differentiates between a \u2018public\u2019 and a \u2018formal language\u2019;\nlater he speaks of\n[t]wo general types of code ... elaborated and restricted. They can be defined, on a\nlinguistic level, in terms of the probability of predicting for any one speaker which\nsyntactic elements are to be used to organize meaning across a representative range of\nspeech. The codes themselves are functions of a particular form of social relationship,\nor more generally of social structures ...\nThe most general condition for the emergence of the [restricted] code is a social\nrelationship based upon a common, extensive set of closely related identifications and\nexpectations self-consciously held by the members ... The meanings are likely to be\nconcrete, descriptive or narrative rather than analytical or abstract ...\nAn elaborated code, where prediction is much less possible ... is likely to arise in that\nsocial relationship which raises the tension in its members to select verbal arrangement\nfrom their linguistic resources which closely fits specific referents. This situation will\narise where the intent of the other person cannot be taken for granted, having the 164 Understanding pragmatics\nconsequence that meanings will have to be expanded and raised to the level of verbal\nexplicitness. Here verbal planning, unlike the case in the restricted code, promotes a\nhigher level of syntactic organization and lexical selection. The preparation and\ndelivery of relatively explicit meaning is the major function of this code.\n(Bernstein 1967: 127ff.)\nThus, codes are learned by children in their sociocultural environment, that is first of\nall in their families. Bernstein (1972: 174) differentiates two types of families; the\nstatus-oriented and the person-oriented family. As Dittmar (1976: 25) points out, the\n\u2018status-oriented type admits of few alternatives in communication; it is therefore\ndescribed ... as a \u201cclosed role system\u201d, which is characteristic for the genesis of the\n\u201crestricted\u201d speech code\u2019 whereas the person-oriented family offers \u2018many alternatives\n... in communication\u2019. This \u2018open role system\u2019 \u2018produces the elaborated speech code\u2019.\nRestricted codes are context-dependent, predictable and therefore \u2018particularistic\u2019,\nwhereas elaborated codes are context independent, much less predictable and thus\n\u2018universalistic\u2019 (Bernstein 1972: 163). Bernstein (1967: 128) points out that \u2018[r]estricted\ncodes are not necessarily linked to social class\u2019. However, in non-verbal and verbal\nintelligence tests as well as in a number of experiments2 he claims to have found\ncorrelations between speech codes and social class which verify the following\nhypothesis:\nChildren socialized within middle class and associated strata can be expected to\npossess both an elaborated and a restricted code; while children socialized within some\nsections of the working class strata, particularly the lower working class, can be\nexpected to be limited to the restricted code.\n(Bernstein 1967: 131)\nThus Bernstein claimed that children who were socialized mainly in a restricted code\nare limited in their communicative skills (hence the criticism of the code theory as\nbeing a deficit hypothesis); usually these children are members of the lower classes; on\nthe other hand, children who acquired and were socialized in an elaborate code are\nverbally skilled speakers who can deal with all kinds of communicative situations;\nusually these children grow up in middle class families.\nThis has consequences for the school career of middle and lower class children.\nSuccess at school requires the use of the elaborate code which is transmitted there. This\nconstitutes a big disadvantage for children of the lower classes: \u2018If a child is to succeed\nas he progresses through school, it becomes critical for him to possess, or at least be\noriented towards, an elaborated code\u2019 (Bernstein 1967: 131). This educational inequality\n\u2013 for Bernstein (1961: 308) \u2018a wastage of working-class educational potential\u2019 \u2013\nperpetuates the inequality between the classes in the Western capitalist system:\nThe code theory asserts that there is a social class regulated unequal distribution of\nprivileging principles of communication ... and that social class, indirectly, effects the\nclassification and framing of the elaborated code transmitted by the school so as to\nfacilitate and perpetuate its unequal acquisition. Thus the code theory ... draws Pragmatics and politics 165\nattention to the relations between macro power relations and micro practices of\ntransmission, acquisition and evaluation and the positioning and oppositioning to\nwhich these practices give rise.\n(Bernstein 1990: 118f.)\nBernstein\u2019s research was politically explosive and had pedagogical consequences, both\nin Europe and, especially, in North America. A number of so-called \u2018compensatory\u2019\neducation programmes were developed and carried out, like the \u2018Operation Headstart\u2019\nprogramme in the USA (see Dittmar 1976: 87, 94f.). Dittmar \u2013 from a Marxist point of\nview \u2013 explains this as follows:\nThe reasons for the rapid success of Bernstein\u2019s socialization theory are self evident: it\nnames factors preventing full utilization of cultural reserves and proposes a way of\nrectifying this without calling into question the structure of authority and production\nin a capitalist society.\n(Dittmar 1976: 85)\nThroughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s Bernstein\u2019s theory and his and his followers\u2019\nempirical research on the interrelationship between language, social class and\nsocialization and the compensatory education programmes were heavily criticized (see\nDittmar 1976: Chapters Two and Three; also Good 1999: 9). The failure of the\ncompensatory programmes in the USA \u2013 despite their considerable financial costs \u2013\nfalsified \u2018the hopes of State and industrial interests in relation to compensatory\nprogrammes\u2019 (Dittmar 1976: 87) and supported scholars who refuted the basic theoretical\nconception of the code theory on which these programmes were based. Dittmar pointed\nout that \u2018the controversy about the Deficit Hypothesis ... can be regarded ... as the catalyst\nfor the defects of this theory in the academic and social sphere\u2019 (Dittmar 1976: 87). For\nLabov (1970a: 180), the \u2018essential fallacy of the verbal deprivation theory lies in tracing\nthe educational failure of the child to his personal deficiencies\u2019; he argued that\ncompensatory programmes were doomed to fail because they were \u2018designed to repair\nthe child, rather than the school\u2019; on the basis of his linguistic research he pleaded to\nchange the institution \u2018School\u2019 so that school education could offer equal opportunities\nto all pupils, regardless of their social class background. The next section provides a brief\nsurvey of the variability concept and William Labov\u2019s contributions to it.\n6.3 WILLIAM LABOV AND THE VARIABILITY CONCEPT\nThe variability concept is rooted in the tradition of American, British and Prague\nstructuralism and influenced by the traditional linguistic disciplines that are\nconcerned with the analysis of speech variation, such as dialectology, anthropological\nlinguistics and research on languages in contact. It starts from a completely different\ntheoretical position than the code theory and uses much more adequate descriptive\nmethods for analysing different language varieties than Bernstein and his followers\nwho were trained psychologists and education researchers. 166 Understanding pragmatics\nThe difference hypothesis assumes that language varieties are functionally\nequivalent \u2018in relation to the possibilities of expression and the logical capacity for\nanalysis\u2019 and aims at the \u2018explanation of all linguistic differentiations caused by the\nintervention of social and regional parameters, and of their correlations with the social\nstructure\u2019 (Dittmar 1976: 103). Thus, contrary to the directed hypotheses of research\nin the code theory paradigm that try to explain the role of differently evaluated speech\ncodes for the social success of its speakers at school by considering just a limited\nnumber of social parameters, the research hypotheses within the variability concept\nare undirected. The speech behaviour described in the variability concept paradigm is\nnot observed in formal test situations (mostly) in school contexts, but in naturally\noccurring social interactions on the basis of participant observation and other,\nspecially developed methods of data gathering (see Labov 1970b, 1972d). The aim is to\ndiscover socially determined speech norms, both on the micro level \u2013 where forms of\nverbal interaction between individuals are analysed \u2013 and on the macro level \u2013 where\nthe distribution and function of speech varieties in a society are researched (see\nDittmar 1976: 103). Language is studied in its social context with a strong emphasis on\nthe specific speech situation and the social background and significance of the\ncommunicative interaction and the speakers involved. In addition, questions about\nthe pragmatic functions of language varieties are in the focus of the variability concept.\nFor the purposes pursued here, this section will concentrate only on a few of Labov\u2019s\npapers which refute the deficit hypothesis and compensatory education programmes,\nespecially in ghetto schools. Labov starts his paper on \u2018The logic of nonstandard English\u2019\nwith the observation that these programmes are based on the assumption that the Black\nchildren in these schools \u2018show a cultural deficit as a result of an impoverished\nenvironment in their early years. As far as language is concerned, the deficit theory\nappears as a concept of \u201cverbal deprivation\u201d\u2019 (Labov 1970a: 153). Labov supports this\nassessment with quotes from Bereiter et al.\u2019s (1966) and Bereiter and Engelmann\u2019s (1966)\npublications on this topic which are based on Bernstein\u2019s code theory. Labov writes:\nBereiter\u2019s program for an academically oriented preschool is based upon their premise\nthat Negro children must have a language with which they can learn, and their\nempirical finding that these children come to school without such a language. In his\nwork on four-year-old Negro children from Urbana, Bereiter reports that their\ncommunication was by gestures, \u2018single words\u2019, and \u2018a series of badly connected words\nor phrases\u2019 such as They mine and Me got juice. He reports that Negro children could\nnot ask questions, that \u2018without exaggeration ... these four-year-olds could make no\nstatements of any kind\u2019. Furthermore, when these children were asked \u2018Where is the\nbook?\u2019, they did not know enough to look at the table where the book was lying in order\nto answer. Thus Bereiter concludes that the children\u2019s speech forms are nothing more\nthan a series of emotional cries, and he decides to treat them \u2018as if the children had no\nlanguage at all\u2019. He identifies their speech with his interpretation of Bernstein\u2019s\nrestricted code: \u2018the language of culturally deprived children ... is not merely an\nunderdeveloped version of standard English, but is a basically non-logical mode of\nexpressive behavior\u2019 (Bereiter et al., 1966. p. 113).\n(Labov 1970a: 156f.) Pragmatics and politics 167\nLabov debunks \u2018the notion of \u201cverbal deprivation\u201d [as] a part of the modern\nmythology of educational psychology\u2019 and sets out to \u2018clear away\u2019 this \u2018illusion ... and\nprovide a more adequate notion of the relations between standard and non-standard\ndialects\u2019. He shows that the \u2018empirical\u2019 findings reported by Bereiter and his co-workers\nare based on \u2018a poor understanding of the nature of language\u2019 (Labov 1970a: 154) and\npoints out that the interview data gathered and presented by Bereiter to illustrate and\njustify his analysis are based on the\nasymmetrical situation ... where anything [the child] says can literally be held against\nhim. He has learned a number of devices to avoid saying anything in this situation ... If\none takes this interview as a measure of the verbal capacity of the child, it must be as\nhis capacity to defend himself in a hostile and threatening situation ... The verbal\nbehavior which is shown by the child ... is ... the result of regular sociolinguistic factors\noperating upon adult and child in this asymmetrical situation.\n(Labov 1970a: 158)\nOn the basis of his own data and data gathered by his collaborators, Labov illustrates\nthat \u2018in many ways working-class speakers are more effective narrators, reasoners, and\ndebaters than many middle-class speakers who temporize, qualify, and lose their\nargument in a mass of irrelevant detail\u2019 (Labov 1970a: 164). His comparative analysis\nof Standard English and what he calls Non-standard Negro English (NNE) reveals\nthat both dialects follow distinct grammatical rules and a logic of their own and he\npoints out that \u2018[a]ll linguists who work with NNE recognize that it is a separate system,\nclosely related to Standard English but set apart from the surrounding white dialects\nby a number of persistent and systematic differences\u2019 (Labov 1970a: 184). The fact that\nthe data and insights on the NNE gathered and gained by linguists like Labov differ so\nmuch from the claims of educational psychologists like Bereiter and Engelmann is due\nto the different theoretical and methodological approaches to this variety of American\nEnglish. The insights gained by research done within the framework of the variability\nconcept reveal the inadequacy and fallacies of the deficit hypothesis and its \u2018ignorance\nof the most basic facts about human language and the people who speak it\u2019 (Labov\n1970a: 187). Labov concludes his plea for an appropriate treatment of the non-standard\ndialect of Black schoolchildren as follows: \u2018That educational psychology should be\nstrongly influenced by a theory so false to the facts of language is unfortunate; but that\nchildren should be the victims of this ignorance is intolerable\u2019 (Labov 1970a: 187).\nInsights like this illustrate that at least at this point of the controversy scholars like\nLabov were completely aware of the political importance and impact of their research.\nThe highly political controversy about how to assess and understand the speech\nbehaviour of Blacks in the USA pedagogically, socially and linguistically motivated\nLabov and other linguists working within the theoretical framework of the variability\nconcept to continue and intensify their research on this variety of American English.\nThe various labels they used to refer to this language variety \u2013 Non-standard Negro\nEnglish (NNE) \u2013 Black English Vernacular (BEV) \u2013 Afro-American (Vernacular)\nEnglish (AA(V)E) \u2013 African American Language (AAL) \u2013 mirror the political impact\nthis research had over the years, as well as the various political and linguistic ideologies 168 Understanding pragmatics\nwith respect to the \u2018politically\u2019 correct reference to this variety. In a number of studies\nLabov (1972a) described the structure \u2013 the grammatical and semantic rules \u2013 of AAL\nin which he explained, for example, why a sentence like\nIt ain\u2019t no cat can\u2019t get in no coop\ndoes not mean:\n*\u2019There isn\u2019t any cat that cannot get into any [pigeon] coop.\u2019\nbut, according to the grammatical and semantic rules of the AAL:\n\u2018There isn\u2019t any cat that can get into any [pigeon] coop.\u2019\n(Labov 1972a: 130).\nMoreover, Labov studied the use of AAL in ritual insults (see 3.3.1 above) and in stories\nof personal experience (see also Dittmar 1976: 226\u2013235) and analysed this language in\nits specific social setting in New York City. He impressively illustrates not only the\ncreative power of the grammar of the language spoken by the Blacks in South Central\nHarlem, but also the \u2018great verbal skills\u2019 its speakers display, for example in ritual\ninsults that are \u2018well-organized speech event(s) which [occur] with great frequency in\nthe verbal interaction of black adolescents ... and [occupy] long stretches of their time\u2019\n(Labov 1972b: 305). Despite their low level of achievement in school, the Black\nadolescents who get engaged in ritual insults show (off) their highly-developed\nlinguistic competence and capabilities within this form of interaction with members\nof their peer group. Detailed and minute studies like these contributed to finishing the\nhot and often highly ideological controversy between the supporters of the code theory\nand their opponents, who argued on the basis of the variability concept. The outcome\nof the dispute was finally a matter of a good theory driving out a bad one.3\nThat ideology also played a role for the Black adolescents in Harlem themselves and\nnot only for the linguists who researched their verbal behaviour was illustrated by\nLabov in his article on \u2018The linguistic consequences of being a lame\u2019. The Harlem\nadolescents refer to \u2018isolated children who grow up without being members of any\nvernacular peer group\u2019 as \u2018lames\u2019. Therefore they do not have the grammatical\ncompetence and the verbal skills to adequately interact with members of these groups.\nThey all simply \u2018lack the knowledge which is necessary to run any kind of game in the\nvernacular culture\u2019, as Labov (1972c: 84) points out. Thus, \u2018language is one of the most\nstriking and salient emblems of lame status\u2019 (Labov 1972c: 108). This reveals that the\nspeakers of AAL have developed a language ideology which excludes, segregates and\ndenounces individuals whose Black English (BE) language variety is closer to Standard\nEnglish (SE) than to the BE spoken in the vernacular culture. Labov\u2019s research results\nin the following insights:\nCategorical or semi-categorical rules of BE are weakened to variable rules by the Lames;\nvariable rules that are in strong use in BE are reduced to a low level by the Lames. Pragmatics and politics 169\nWhenever there is a contrast between SE and BE, the language of the lames is shifted\ndramatically to SE. In many cases, this leads to a close alignment between the Lames\nand white non-standard vernaculars.\n(Labov 1972c: 98)\nHowever, as Labov points out, these \u2018lames\u2019 are quite often consultants of linguists and\nanthropologists, because these \u2018marginal men ... are detached from their own society\nfar enough to be interested and accessible to the language, the problems and\npreoccupations of the investigator\u2019. As consultants they cannot but give \u2018an inaccurate\nor misleading account of the vernacular culture\u2019 (Labov 1972c: 110). It is evident that\nthis is an important insight for anthropological, linguistic and pragmatic research:\n[A]n accurate description of a language will demand some knowledge of the social\nstructure of its users. We must be able to find our way through the various intersecting\npatterns of the normally heterogeneous society if we are to locate the most uniform\nand consistent forms of the grammar, since an understanding of variation requires a\nrealistic assessment of the invariance that accompanies it.\n(Labov 1972c: 108)\nThis knowledge is only gained by studying the speakers\u2019 actual use of language in\nsocial interactions.\nThe deficit versus difference hypothesis controversy resulted in innovative\nmethodological tools and theoretical as well as practical insights which are extremely\nimportant for present-day research on endangered languages and efforts to revitalize\nthem. Projects that aim to document and revitalize endangered languages require\ndescriptive competence and sociolinguistic \u2013 or, if you like, ethnographic and\npragmatic \u2013 expertise to gain insights into why a language is endangered and what\neffects this process has on the speakers\u2019 attitudes towards their language. This\nknowledge puts linguists engaged in these endeavours into the position to decide\nwhether there are chances to reverse language shift in progress that will otherwise lead\nto language loss. The attitudes of speakers of endangered language are very much\nshaped by their own language ideologies and by those of others (see Senft 2010c). In the\nnext subsection of this chapter we will have a closer look at language ideologies and\ntheir implications for research in pragmatics.\n6.4 LANGUAGE IDEOLOGIES\nIn his pioneering paper on \u2018Language structure and linguistic ideologies\u2019 Michael\nSilverstein (1979: 193) defined \u2018... ideologies about language, or linguistic ideologies,\n[as] any sets of beliefs about language articulated by the users as a rationalization or\njustification of perceived language structure and use\u2019. These language ideologies are\n\u2018expressed in native metapragmatic theories or ethno-metapragmatics ... as\nrationalizations about the use of language\u2019 (Silverstein 1979: 207f.). In their 1994 survey\narticle on research on language ideology and language attitudes, Kathryn Woolard 170 Understanding pragmatics\nand Bambi Schieffelin review \u2018the full range of scholars\u2019 notions of ideology: from\nseemingly neutral cultural conceptions of language to strategies for maintaining social\npower, from unconscious ideology read from speech practices by analysts to the most\nconscious native-speaker explanations of appropriate language behavior\u2019 (Woolard\nand Schieffelin 1994: 58).\nIn his recent monograph on Ideology in Language Use Jef Verschueren elaborates on\nthe concept of ideology as follows: He points out that \u2018... ideology is associated with\nunderlying patterns of meaning, frames of interpretation, world views, or forms of\neveryday thinking and explanation.\u2019 For him a language ideology \u2018is a fully integrated\nsociocultural-cognitive phenomenon\u2019 that represents its speakers\u2019 \u2018general way of\nthinking about language\u2019, which \u2018involves a specific form of intersubjectivity or sharing\n..., as well as affect and stance\u2019 (Verschueren 2012: 7ff.). He defines the concept of\nideology (in general) in four main theses (printed in bold in the original) which run as\nfollows:\nWe can define as ideological any basic pattern of meaning or frame of interpretation\nbearing on or involved in (an) aspect(s) of social \u2018reality\u2019 (in particular in the realm of\nsocial relations in the public sphere), felt to be commonsensical, and often functioning\nin a normative way.\n(Verschueren 2012: 10)\nIn an additional comment to this thesis Verschueren points out that\nthe common-sense ... nature of ideological meaning is manifested in the fact that it is\nrarely questioned ... Its not being questioned means that the meaning concerned is often\n... carried along implicitly rather than being formulated explicitly.\n(Verschueren 2012: 12f.)\nThe next three theses run as follows:\nIdeology ... may be highly immune to experience and observation.\n(Verschueren 2012: 14)\n(One of) the most visible manifestation(s) of ideology is LANGUAGE USE or\nDISCOURSE, which may reflect, construct and/or maintain ideological patterns.\n(Verschueren 2012: 17)\nDiscursively reflected, constructed, and or supported ideological meaning may serve\nthe purposes of framing, validating, explaining, or legitimating attitudes, states of\naffairs, and actions in the domain in which they are applicable.\n(Verschueren 2012: 19)\nVerschueren illustrates his definition of ideology in language use with a corpus of\nhistory textbooks from the late nineteenth to the twentieth century. In what follows Pragmatics and politics 171\nthe concept of linguistic ideology will be illustrated with examples from the Solomon\nIslands and from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and with ideologies underlying honorific\nlanguage use.\n6.4.1 Language ideologies in two Pacific speech communities\nIn their anthology Consequences of Contact: Language Ideologies and Sociocultural\nTransformations in Pacific Societies Miki Makihara and Bambi B. Schieffelin (2007; see\nSenft 2010b) try to explain why the Pacific has been an area of enormous contemporary\nlinguistic, cultural, political and social diversity. Much of this diversity can be\nexplained by the different contact situations Pacific communities have experienced\nwith both former and present-day colonial and postcolonial powers, governments and\nreligious institutions, as well as by more recent influences such as globalization,\nurbanization, militarization and environmental change. Systematic research on the\nindigenous languages spoken in the Pacific did not start until the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. By now, scholars within the social and cognitive sciences have realized that\nlanguage and speech practices in Pacific societies play a central role in the construction\nof self and for these communities\u2019 social and political realities. Language diversity is\nunderstood as a marker of social identity. However, the fact that contact and trade\nlanguages and lingua francas (most of which have now become creoles) developed,\nshows the need for shared translocal languages in the area as well. The consequences\nof contact history for the diversity of the languages spoken in the Pacific were\nfundamental; unfortunately, they were also quite often fatal. Indigenous languages\nspoken in the Pacific area have been dying ever since earliest contacts with European\nlanguages. Missionaries and government officials introduced literacy and Western\nscripts with the first translations of (parts of) the Bible into a usually randomly selected\nvariety of one of the local languages. This resulted in the marginalization, if not death,\nof other dialects not only of the chosen local language but more often than not also of\nits neighbouring languages and in the abandonment of the very few indigenous scripts,\nlike the Rongorongo script of the Rapa Nui. Writing was suddenly taken as being more\nauthoritative than speaking. These new notions about language also introduced new\nlanguage ideologies into the various speech communities which re-shaped indigenous\nways of feeling, thinking and speaking about language. The featuring of the following\ntwo representative contributions to Makihara\u2019s and Schieffelin\u2019s anthology illustrate\nthe importance of language ideologies for an adequate understanding of the strong\ninterrelationship between linguistic and cultural processes in contact situations for\ntwo speech communities in the Pacific.\n6.4.1.1 Language ideologies in Honiara, Solomon Islands\nIn her essay on \u2018Linguistic paths to urban self in postcolonial Solomon Islands\u2019\nChristine Jourdan (2007) describes and analyses the urban modalities of language use\nby residents of Honiara, the capital city of the Solomon Islands, with the aim of\nshowing how contact has affected urban definitions of self and identity. In multilingual\nHoniara \u2013 there are more than 70 languages spoken in the Solomons \u2013 cultural and 172 Understanding pragmatics\nlinguistic contact, together with ideologies of change and progress, has created the\nneed for a definition of urban identity which feeds on ideologies of tradition, custom,\nmodernization and social roles and options, and which is revealed through language\nchoice and verbal practice. Language choice is not only an expression of the speaker\u2019s\nidentity and agency. The attention speakers pay to language selection also reveals a\ngreat deal about their need constantly to redefine their sociality, as well as about the\nsituatedness of the speakers\u2019 social selves in situations of culture contact. Jourdan\nprovides some background information on the effects of contact on the linguistic\nsituation of the Solomon Islands prior to and during colonization and on postcolonial\nHoniara. She points out that multilingualism has always been a feature of Solomon\nIsland societies. Although the dominant language ideology of the colonial times used\nto be characterized by linguistic hegemony and hierarchy, the linguistic and social\nparameters of this multilingual situation have changed in recent times. The colonial\nsociolinguistic hierarchy, with English \u2013 the official language \u2013 at the top and local\nvernaculars and Solomons Pijin \u2013 the lingua franca \u2013 at the bottom, has been\nreorganized.4 Jourdan points out that Honiarans now use different language varieties\nto index their position in the urban world, to indicate ethnic identities and to illustrate\ntheir social sophistication. Thus, their language choice reveals the situated and\ncontextual construction of their social selves. In present-day Honiara, languages not\nonly mark ethnicity, but also social class, age group, and urban identity. Honiarans\nhave constructed a hierarchy of languages which is context-dependent:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) if they want to emphasize their ethnic selves, the vernaculars are placed at the top;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) if they want to index their gendered selves, Pijin and vernaculars come first;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) and if they want to index that they are young urban people they stress Pijin as the\nlanguage for daily interaction and English as the language of social advancement.\nThus, the language ideology that was dominant in pre-colonial times characterized by\nreciprocal multilingualism and the language ideology that was dominant in colonial\ntimes characterized by linguistic hegemony and hierarchy have both been replaced by\nmultiple ideologies which compete with one another. These insights are crucial for a\nsound analysis of language use in Honiara.\n6.4.1.2 Language ideology of the Rapa Nui\nMiki Makihara\u2019s (2007) essay on \u2018Linguistic purism in Rapa Nui political discourse\u2019\nexamines ideologies of code choice and language revitalization embedded in forms of\npolitical discourse among the bilingual, indigenous Polynesian community of Rapa\nNui (or Easter Island), which Chile annexed in 1888. Since then the Rapa Nui language\nhas been marginalized and endangered by the spread of Spanish, the national language\nof Chile. However, Rapa Nui political leaders have challenged this situation first by\nexpanding syncretic Rapa Nui-Spanish speech styles into the public and political\ndomain. More recently, they have developed an ideology of linguistic purism and\nconstructed purist Rapa Nui linguistic codes for political discourse in order to re-\nemphasize the value of their Polynesian language and to voice their ethnic identity Pragmatics and politics 173\nwithin the Chilean nation. After a brief summary of the historical, sociolinguistic and\npolitical contexts of these developments relating them to the island\u2019s particular history\nof contact, Makihara presents and analyses two excerpts taken from a forum to debate\naspects of the Rapa Nui Indigenous Law and from a meeting with a continental\ngovernment official. The following example, taken from the first excerpt (Makihara\n2007: 55), illustrates the use of syncretic Rapa Nui, which is \u2018characterized by the\nsimultaneous presence of multiple varieties of Rapa Nui and Spanish within and across\nindividual utterances\u2019 (Makihara 2007: 50). It was taken from a debate about indigenous\nlaw between the president of a self-proclaimed council of elders (C) and the Rapa Nui\ngovernor (G); parts of the utterances in which speakers switch from Rapa Nui to\nSpanish are underlined:\nC.

This time the very same president of the council of elders\naddresses monolingual Spanish-speaking Chilean senators in purist Rapa Nui, which\nwas then \u2018translated\u2019 into Spanish by another leader of the council:\nC: Te m\u00e3tou me\u2019e ha\u014ba, ke hakanoho i te\nC: What we (EXCL) want is to stop all that is\nme\u2019e ta \u2018ato \u2018a nei o te hora nei e makenu\nmoving at this moment, that we don\u2019t\nmai ena, \u2018ina he a\u014bia\u014bi mai.

S.)] to the land, which is the base for all\nel desarrollo de la isla. Sin la tierra no podemos hacer nada.\ndevelopment of the island. Without the land we cannot do anything.\n(Makihara 2007: 58)\nThe Rapa Nui speech and the Spanish translation had two audiences \u2013 the Chilean\nsenators and the Rapa Nui participants. Makahira explains what was actually going on\nduring these speeches:\nThe message to the senators in purist Rapa Nui speech was largely symbolic, aimed at\nhighlighting the cultural differences between the representatives of the state and the\nRapa Nui, and at adding weight to Rapa Nui claims of self-representation and ancestral\nrights over their land. The propositional content of the main leader\u2019s Rapa Nui speech,\nhowever, also targets his fellow Rapa Nui as explicitly addressed recipients of the\nmessage. The speaker frequently uses the inclusive first person pronoun t\u00e3tou (\u2018we\u2019 or\n\u2018our\u2019 including you) to refer to Rapa Nui (except for one occasion...[see first line of the\nexcerpt above; G. S.]), and he refers to the senators and Chileans in general as r\u00e3ua\n\u2018they\u2019. He represents claims and requests addressed to the Chilean audience explaining\nthem to the Rapa Nui audience and calls on the Rapa Nui to unite [in another part of\nhis speech not presented here] ... In his translation [the other Rapa Nui leader] ... goes\nwell beyond the original in establishing the identities of the parties involved and the\nrelationships between them: ... the speakers as \u201clegitimate representatives of the Rapa\nNui people\u201d ..., the addressees as \u201chonorable senators\u201d ...[as] intermediaries who should\n\u201ctransmit [the Rapa Nui] concern to the supreme government\u201d ... Through the use of\n... contextualization cues and politeness markers [the translator] skillfully establishes a\nhorizontal alignment between Chileans and Rapa Nui...\nThe juxtaposition of the speaker and the translator and of two clearly separated\nlanguages, and especially the choice of purist Rapa Nui, contributed greatly to the\ncommunicative effectiveness of the performance.\n(Makahira 2007: 60)\nThe use of purist Rapa Nui in this meeting had two important functions: on the one\nhand it emphasized the ethnic, political and linguistic boundaries between the\nChileans and the Rapa Nui, and on the other hand it had an important bonding 176 Understanding pragmatics\nfunction for the Rapa Nui, because the purist language use is a symbol for their unity\nand a historical coherence before and after the independence of the island community\nfrom Chile. The existence of purist Rapa Nui could be supportive for language\nrevitalization and maintenance projects. However, syncretic Rapa Nui is the dominant\nvariety in everyday life and in real discussions of substance in political discourse. The\npurist registers developed by political activists for Rapa Nui are only used as a means\nto unite the indigenous community of the Rapa Nui symbolically against outsiders\nand to voice their own ethnic identity.\n6.4.2 Language ideologies of honorific language\nIn his seminal paper on linguistic ideology Michael Silverstein (1979: 216ff.) provided\nan analysis of \u2018the so-called \u201clinguistic etiquette\u201d of Javanese\u2019 based on Clifford\nGeertz\u2019s ethnographic masterpiece The Religion of Java (1976 [= 1960]) to illustrate his\nconcept of language ideology. In 1998 Judith Irvine published a revised and enlarged\nversion of her 1992 paper on \u2018Ideologies of honorific language\u2019 in which she compared\n\u2018Javanese, Wolof ... Zulu ... [and] ChiBemba ... with regard to honorific expressions and\nthe social and cultural frameworks relevant thereto\u2019 (Irvine 1992: 251). She defines\nhonorifics as \u2018means of expressing respect (or disrespect)\u2019 (Irvine 1992: 251) which are\nmanifest in \u2018specially conventionalized forms\u2019 (Irvine 1998: 51) which signal \u2018deference\u2019\nin a way that also \u2018requires some further set of shared understandings about the\nexpression\u2019s significance and pragmatic potential\u2019 (Irvine 1998: 53). She aims to answer\nthe question whether \u2018one can identify any cultural concomitants of linguistic systems\nin which honorifics occur\u2019 (Irvine 1998: 51).\nAlready the choice of the languages analysed \u2013 Javanese is a Western Austronesian\nlanguage, whereas, Wolof, Zulu and ChiBemba are Niger-Congo languages \u2013 reveals\nthat the presence of honorifics is found in unrelated speech communities around the\nworld. And a closer look at the social structure of the four speech communities\nallows her to refute the prevalent hypothesis that \u2018court life and/or entrenched class\ndifferences are ... necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of linguistic\nhonorifics\u2019. Irvine argues that \u2018the relationship between the distribution of social\nand linguistic forms is more productively sought in cultural ideologies of language\n[paying] special attention to the language ideologies that link ideas about language\nwith ideas about social rank, respect and appropriate conduct\u2019. She highlights the\n\u2018connection with power relations and interests that are central in a social order\u2019\nwhich is connoted with the concept \u2018ideology\u2019 as a relevant characteristic of honorific\nlanguage (Irvine 1998: 52).\nIn her first analysis of the Javanese honorifics she shows that in this language\nrespectful expression operates through a complex system of lexical alternants. She\nillustrates the six language levels of Javanese \u2013 the four higher levels of Krama and\nMadya and the two lower levels of Ngoko \u2013 with the following examples taken from\nJoseph Errington (1988: 90f.; see Irvine 1992: 253):\nKRAMA: 1. menapa nandalem mundhut sekul semanten\n2. menapa panjenengan mendhet sekul semanten Pragmatics and politics 177\nMADYA: 3. napa sampeyan mendhet sekul semonten\n4. napa sampeyan njupuk senga semonten\nNGOKO: 5. apa sliramu mundhut sega semono\n6. apa kowe njupuk sega semono\nGloss Question marker you take rice that much\nDid you take that much rice?\nIn the Niger-Congo language Zulu spoken in South Africa there is a respect vocabulary\nwhich is known as hlonipha. Irvine (1992: 253) provides examples of ordinary and\nhlonipha lexical alternants provided by Doke and Vilakazi (1958); some of these are\npresented below (the graphemes \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 represent clicks):\nORDINARY HLONIPHA\n\u2018graze, weave\u2019 aluka acuka\n\u2018be rejected\u2019 jaba gxaba\n\u2018house\u2019 indlu incumba\n\u2018our\u2019 -ithu -it\u0161u\n\u2018thy\u2019 -kho -to\nBesides the hlonipha respect vocabulary, Zulu has another type of deferential\nexpression, bonga \u2013 \u2018praise\u2019. Irvine (1998: 58) points out that these two types are\n\u2018ideologically linked with different social contexts (family and court)5 and with\ndifferent users (women and men)\u2019. In former times hlonipha words allowed Zulu\nwomen to \u2018avoid uttering the name of the husband\u2019s father\u2019 as well as words that\nsounded like this name. Irvine (1998: 60) also points out that \u2018hlonipha forms were also\nused by men to avoid using the name of the mother-in-law, though the custom was not\nas strict for men as it was for women\u2019. The use of hlonipha also required specifc forms\nof behaviour, such as the avoidance of eye-contact, restraining one\u2019s affectivity and\ncovering one\u2019s body.\nThe bonga type of deferential expression is used to \u2018express gratitude\u2019 and refers to\n\u2018an exuberant poetic style of male public oratory, usually addressed to important\npolitical figures ... at public gatherings\u2019; there are \u2018male professional praise-poets\u2019 who\nperform praises characterized by \u2018vivid detailed imagery and a sense of spontaneous\nenthusiasm\u2019 (Irvine 1998: 59). The bonga type, however, does not rely on honorifics in\nthe form of isosemantic (i.e. same-sensed) alternants.\nIrvine summarized her description of the Zulu types of deferential expressions as\nfollows:\n[T]he Zulu expressive system includes an utterer-focused, ecstatic, high-affect, engaged\nstyle without honorifics, and an addressee- or bystander-focused, flat-affect,\ndisengaged, avoidance style with honorifics.\n(Irvine 1998: 59) 178 Understanding pragmatics\nThe Niger-Congo language ChiBemba, spoken in Zambia, expresses respect\nthrough its noun class system (Irvine 1992: 254). Languages with noun class systems\ndivide nouns into different classes, each of which requires a different set of agreement\nmarkers on verbs, adjectives, possessive pronouns, numerals, etc. In the ChiBemba\nsystem most human nouns belong to class 1 in the singular and class 2 in the plural.\nNouns in class 1 with singular reference can be marked for honorification by being\nshifted in form and agreement to class 2 (in a similar way as in French, for example,\nwhere we have the second person plural pronoun vous which can be used as a honorific\nplural form instead of the second person singular form tu); however, given this fact,\nthere is no corresponding way of marking honorification in the plural. This is\nillustrated with the following examples:\n(a) not respectful\numo umukalamba waandi aleelya isabi\n1 1 1 1 9a\none older-sibling my subject-tense-eat fish\n\u2018One of my older siblings is eating fish.\u2019\n([more literally (G. S.)], \u2018My one older sibling is eating fish.\u2019)\n(b) respectful\nBamo abakalamba baandi baaleelya isabi\n2 2 2 2 9a\none older-sibling my subject-tense-eat fish\n\u2018One of my older siblings is eating fish.\u2019\n(([more literally (G. S.)], \u2018My one older sibling is eating fish.\u2019)\n(c) ambiguous\nbabili abakalamba baandi baaleelya isabi\n2 2 2 2 9a\ntwo older-sibling my subject-tense-eat fish\n\u2018Two of my older siblings are eating fish.\u2019\n([more literally (G. S.)], \u2018My two older siblings are eating fish.\u2019)\nThere are some nouns which are habitually given honorification in this way; assigning\nthem to class 1 (or one of a number of other singular classes) gives rise to interpretations\nof disrespect or insult. Irvine (1992: 254) provides the following examples based on the\nnoun stem -ka\u0161i \u2018wife\u2019:\nCLASS VALUE\nabaka\u0161i \u2018(respectable) wife\u2019 2 honorific\n(because plural, G. S.)\numuka\u0161i \u2018wife\u2019 1 disrespectful\nakaka\u0161i \u2018(insignificant) wife\u2019 12 insult\ni\u010dika\u0161i \u2018(gross) wife\u2019 7 insult\nilika\u0161i \u2018egregious[?] wife\u2019 5 \u201ca little derogatory\u201d Pragmatics and politics 179\nThe Niger-Congo language Wolof, spoken in Senegal, the Gambia and a few other\nWest African countries, does not have a comparable system of alternant expressions\nbut marks respect and deference with two speech registers which are characterized by\ndifferent prosodic patterns. These patterns \u2018are nonsegmentable and operate more on\nthe level of utterance meaning than on the level of sentence meaning\u2019 (Irvine 1998: 55).\nThe two speech registers are called waxu g\u00e9\u00e9r \u2018noble speech\u2019 and waxu gewel \u2018griot\nspeech\u2019.6 Irvine (1992: 255) characterizes the prosodic patterns of these two varieties as\nfollows:\nwaxu g\u00e9\u00e9r waxu gewel\n\u2018NOBLE SPEECH\u2019 \u2018GRIOT SPEECH\u2019\nPitch low high\nVolume soft loud\nTempo slow fast\nVoice breathy clear\nContour pitch nucleus last pitch nucleus first\nDynamic range narrow wide\nOther characteristic features that differentiate these two registers are semantic\ndifferences and rhetorical elaborations.\nNow what about the linguistic ideologies that underlie these four systems of\nhonorific language? In Java the priyayi\u2019s, the traditional elite\u2019s, conception of their\nlanguage is characterized by:\nideas about subtlety and refinement on the one hand and violence and anger on the\nother ... The \u2018higher\u2019 ... levels are considered to be governed by an ethic of proper order,\npeace and calm ... The \u2018lower\u2019 levels ... are \u2018the language one loses one\u2019s temper in\u2019 ... Yet\nin some ways the point is really what happens not to one\u2019s own temper but to one\u2019s\naddressee\u2019s. The language levels are addressee-focused ... Polite conduct toward a\nrespected addressee is conduct that is stylized, depersonalized, and flat-affect ... Still,\nthe use of \u2018high\u2019 deferential styles also implies the speaker\u2019s own refinement as shown\nby her/his ability to efface emotion, sensitivity to the stability of others, and pragmatic\ndelicacy.\n(Irvine 1992: 256)\nThe Wolof language ideology is characterized by ideas similar to those mentioned for\nthe Javanese priyayi, however, the use of the two varieties \u2013 noble speech and griot\nspeech \u2013\nis not limited to the social ranks they are named for. Both registers are used on some\noccasions by almost everyone. Still, their use always conveys a sense that the participants\nin the speech situation inhabit contrasting ranks, even if only metaphorically.\nNormatively, \u201cgriot speech\u201d is the way low-ranking griots address high-ranking\nnobles. Any person may employ this register to flatter an addressee; yet, in so doing, a\nspeaker engages in griot-like, hence low-ranking, conduct. The Wolof linguistic 180 Understanding pragmatics\nideology ... identifies the register system primarily with the speaker ..., elevating the\naddressee only by implication ... Wolof nobles avoid using the \u201cgriot speech\u201d register ...\non public, formal occasions. Instead, they hire a lower-ranking intermediary, usually a\ngriot, to speak on their behalf. The noble sponsor of the speech thus manages to get the\naddressee flattered while nevertheless suggesting his or her own high rank by\nrefraining from engaging in affectively charged speech ...\n(Irvine 1998: 58)\nIrvine (1998: 59) notes that the Wolof \u2018griot speech\u2019 variety reminds one of the Zulu\npraise-oratory style described above, because \u2018both deliver praise through dramatic,\nheightened affect [and] semantically elaborated discourse\u2019, however, she emphasizes\nthat \u2018Wolof and Zulu differ in that the Zulu linguistic ideology does not connect praise-\nperformance with low caste, or with particularly low rank of any sort. Speaking bonga\nstyle does not compromise the speaker\u2019s status\u2019. Irvine also points out that there is a\nlogical parallel between the Zulu hlonipha style and the higher levels ... of Javanese.\nBoth involve lowered affect, euphemism, neutralization to certain contrasts and\nconspicuous conventionality. The Zulu system, then, incorporates both patterns of\ntalk described ... for Wolof and Javanese.\n(Irvine 1998: 59)\nIrvine summarizes her comparison of the honorific systems of the four languages as\nfollows:\ngrammatical honorifics accompany linguistic ideologies that specify flattened affect,\nconventionality, and avoidance of engagement with the concrete or the sensory as a\nway to express respect for others (rather than ways to express one\u2019s own rank). Put\nanother way, honorifics are embedded in an ideology in which a low-affect style can be\nother-elevating. They are connected with the management of affectivity and\nconventionality, and with the ways these relate to rank and power. What kinds of rank\nand power are concerned varies from one system to another ...\n(Irvine (1992: 261)\nIrvine concludes the 1998 version of her paper with the caveat that linguistic ideologies\nare not only found in allegedly \u2018exotic\u2019 languages but actually almost everywhere \u2013\n\u2018even\u2019 in linguistics:\nSome generations ago, linguists sometimes singled out honorific language in Africa\nand Asia for ridicule or criticism as the signs of what they took to be false pride,\ndecadent overrefinement, or slavish deference to oriental despotism. That they did so\nsays more about those linguists\u2019 attitudes toward indigenous social hierarchies than it\nsays about the language in question or their cultural contexts.\n(Irvine 1998: 64) Pragmatics and politics 181\n6.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis chapter put the rise of sociolinguistics in the historical context of the 1960s, when\nthe discussion of class structure of capitalist societies with its social inequalities\ndominated not only political discourse, but also scientific debates, especially within\nthe humanities. The dispute between proponents of Bernstein\u2019s code theory and\nLabov\u2019s variability concept topicalized paradigmatically the relationship between\nsocial class and speech form. Research within the frame of the difference hypothesis\nrevealed that the classification of the speech of the lower classes as a \u2018restricted\u2019 code\nwas not only based on inadequate methods of data gathering and on a lack of linguistic\nexpertise, but also on language ideologies of researchers who were members of the\n(upper) middle class. They attempted to remedy proclaimed verbal deficits of children\nof the lower classes with compensatory education programmes aimed at \u2018repairing\u2019 the\nchild, but not the school as an institution that represented and propagated first and\nforemost middle class interests. This inadequate approach to the problem politicized\nthe proponents of the variability concept. They demonstrated that a proper\nunderstanding and assessing of the verbal skills of lower class children, especially of\nBlack children in the urban centres of the USA, needed research of how they use their\nlanguage in their social contexts. It is only there that one can gather adequate cultural\nknowledge based on participant observation and the proper linguistic data which\nenable linguists to detect the rule-governed grammatical structure of these children\u2019s\nvernacular. It was probably at this point that the boundary between pragmatics and\nsociolinguistics started to blur (see Foley 1997: 29). Sociolinguistics, like pragmatics,\nbecame interested in actual language use and verbal interactions between speakers in\nvarious social contexts. The proponents of the variability concept finally won their\nstruggle against the supporters of the code theory \u2013 and this finally affected the\neducational politics of the USA, sanctioned even by court decisions.\nThese studies, however, also revealed that language varieties are important status\nemblems, not only for members of the middle classes, but also for the Black adolescents\nstudied by Labov and his colleagues. They used their vernacular and their ideas about\nit as a means to constitute group identity on the one hand and to segregate others who\ncould not adequately command the verbal skills characteristic for their verbal\ninteractions on the other hand. Thus language use as well as language ideology were\ncrucial for the creation of sociocultural identity. To understand these sociolinguistic\npatterns turned out to be crucial for linguists, especially for and in their choice of\nconsultants who are adequate representatives of the speech community to be\nresearched.\nA closer look at language ideologies in other speech communities confirmed that\nideologies are normative for the regulation of social relations between specific speech\ngroups in public interactions. As emblems of social identity they not only mark group\nmembership and solidarity \u2013 and thus have an important bonding function \u2013 they also\nindex a speaker\u2019s position within her or his speech community with respect to social\nrank. Moreover, linguistic ideologies also have the function to legitimize power\nrelations between members of the speech communities and the distribution of power 182 Understanding pragmatics\nwithin a society as a whole. They thus control the political conditions within speech\ncommunities and proper conduct and behaviour of their members. The understanding\nof a society\u2019s linguistic ideologies is crucial for a proper understanding and adequate\nlinguistic analysis of a number of verbal interactions and phenomena to be observed in\ngroup relations within the speech community.\nWhat does this chapter tell us about the anecdote reported in the introduction to\nthis volume? The Trobriand Islanders obviously have a linguistic ideology that\nregulates their greeting behaviour. Whoever is greeted with the question Ambe \u2013\n\u2018Where (are you going to)?\u2019 has to respond respectfully and truthfully according to the\nideology that sets the norm for this verbal interaction. The ideology also prescribes\nthat this reaction is expected from each and every member of the community,\ndisregarding any hierarchical differences within the Trobrianders\u2019 socially highly\nstratified society. Once I had understood this hierarchy levelling \u2013 and at the same\ntime highly bonding \u2013 function of this form of greeting, I could also understand other\nlittle rituals I observed in the village, like the giving and taking of tobacco. It quite\noften happened that people who had just asked me for tobacco and paper and who\ncould hardly wait till they could smoke their hand-rolled cigarette were approached by\nother people who had waited in the background and now asked them for a smoke. I\nobserved that they, almost bewildered, puffed what they had thought was \u2018their\u2019\ncigarette three or four times and then passed it on to the person who had requested it.\nThis behaviour is also based on a normative ideology, albeit a cultural one, which is\nagain binding upon everyone even across clan boundaries: it prescribes the almost\nimmediate passing on of something like a cigarette to someone who asks for it. This\nnorm strengthens group coherence and group identity by testing the validity of group-\nspecific ideologies over and over again in marginal everyday interactions: It contributes\nto the continuity of the group solidarity, strengthens social harmony within the group\nand increases the social bond between the members of the community and is thus\npolitically highly important (see Senft 1995: 218f.).\n6.6 EXERCISE/WORK SECTION\n(cid:120)(cid:3) What are the main characteristics of the linguistic ideology/ideologies which are\nfundamental for the code theory on the one hand and the difference hypothesis on\nthe other?\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Discuss the pros and cons of being a monolingual/multilingual speaker in a\nmultilingual society.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) What is a \u2018standard language\u2019 and who defines this standard?

After this summary of the central concerns of pragmatics, which is\nguided by the leitmotif that \u2018the heart of the pragmatic enterprise [is] the description\nof language as social action\u2019 (Clift et al. 2009: 50), the volume ends with an outlook on\nrecent developments within the discipline that try to \u2018emancipate\u2019 pragmatics from its\ndomination \u2018by views of language derived from Euro-American languages and ways of\nspeaking\u2019 (Hanks et al. 2009a: 1).\n7.2 SUMMARY\nIt was pointed out in the introduction that this volume has the following three central\nthreads that bind the chapters into a complex whole:\n1. Languages are used by their speakers in social interactions; they are first and\nforemost instruments for creating social bonds and accountability relations.\nThe means by which languages create these bonds and relations vary across\nlanguages and cultures.\n2. Speech is part of the context of the situation in which it is produced, language\nhas an essentially pragmatic character and \u2018meaning resides in the pragmatic\nfunction of an utterance\u2019 (Bauman 1992: 147).\n(cid:120)(cid:3) Speakers of a language follow conventions, rules and regulations in their\nuse of language in social interactions.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The meaning of words, phrases and sentences is conveyed in certain kinds\nof situative contexts.\n(cid:120)(cid:3) The speakers\u2019 uses of language fulfil specific functions in and for these\nspeakers\u2019 communicative behaviour.\n3. Pragmatics is the transdiscipline that studies these language- and culture-\nspecific forms of language use. 186 Understanding pragmatics\nThe anecdote reported on the first pages of the volume was taken as exemplary for\n\u2018understanding pragmatics\u2019 because it introduced the central concerns of this\ntransdiscipline. From the point of view of the six disciplines taken as being most\nrelevant for pragmatics it was shown at the end of every chapter how this anecdote\nillustrates not only cultural differences in language use and understanding, but also\nhow cultural, situative and interpersonal context and culture-specific conventions\ncontribute to meaning in actual language use.\nKeeping these fundamental insights in mind, the six chapters are briefly summarized\nas follows:\nChapter One pointed out that philosophers and linguists doing pragmatics understand:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) speech as the performing of actions in specific contexts; these actions have\nmeaning and force and achieve certain effects which co-constitute and create\nsocial reality;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that speech is primarily \u2018an instrument for the creation of accountability relations\u2019\n(Seuren 2009: 140); and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that one of the primary functions of a language is social binding where the resulting\npact or \u2018social contract\u2019 is based on conventions and on the social competence of its\nspeakers.\nChapter Two revealed that psychologists and linguists doing pragmatics emphasize:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that deictic verbal references in speech constitute a collaborative task for speakers\nand hearers who interact with each other;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that gestures that accompany speech are especially designed for addressees to\nestablish not only social bonds but also to convey more or less complex additional\ninformation in social interaction; and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that these references and gestures vary across languages and cultures.\nChapter Three illustrated how human ethologists and linguists doing pragmatics\nhave shown:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that humans have developed complex behaviour patterns which were differentiated\nthrough processes of ritualization into communicative behaviour signals;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that these signals are used to develop social contact with others and to establish\nand maintain a social bond between the senders of the signals and their partners\nin social interactions;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that some of the more complex signals have become social rites which increase the\npredictability of human behaviour and provide security and order in human\ninteraction and that they are therefore highly important for group maintenance;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that humans have developed highly complex and very culture-specific rituals with\nimportant functions of bonding which convey harmony, sympathy, trust and solidarity; Understanding pragmatics 187\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that the familiarity with such forms of ritualized behaviour is the prerequisite for\ngetting access to a group because all its members have to be on \u2018common ground\u2019\nif they want to interact adequately with each other;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that given all these signals, rites and rituals, speech is just one part \u2013 although an\nimportant one \u2013 of human interaction, which is fundamentally multimodal in\nnature; and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that despite the huge variety of these signals, rites and rituals it is possible to\nhypothesize that they could all be based on a finite set of conventionalized basic\ninteraction strategies that might be universal.\nChapter Four emphasized that ethnologists and linguists doing pragmatics point out:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that they understand speech as a mode of behaviour, a mode of action in which the\nmeaning of an utterance is constituted by its function in certain contexts;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that one of the primary forms of language is realized in phatic communion, a form\nof language use that has primarily bonding functions;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that the situative context and the interactants\u2019 common cultural knowledge\nprovide the necessary information for understanding phatic expressions as a\nmeans to consolidate the relationship between the interactants;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that the meaning of an utterance, thus, can only be understood in relation to the\nspeech event in which it is embedded;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that the rules that guide the communicative behaviour of members of a specific\nspeech community can vary immensely; they have to be learned to achieve\ncommunicative competence within this community;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that achieving linguistic and cultural competence in a speech community requires\nthe understanding of how it structures, patterns and regulates its ways of speaking;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that research on the interrelationship between language, culture and cognition treats\nlanguage primarily as an instrument of thought; however, although language\ncontributes in shaping thinking for non-verbal problem solving instances, it remains\nproblematic to argue that it is only language that influences thought in general.\nChapter Five reported that sociologists and linguists doing pragmatics agree:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that social interaction constitutes an institutional order with norms, rights and\nobligations that rule and regulate the interactants\u2019 conduct and behaviour;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that there are procedures and conventions regulating rights and obligations that\nprovide interactants with rules and rituals for \u2018playing\u2019 their interaction \u2018game\u2019; the\nrules are based on social contract and social consensus;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that participants in interactions are aware of the norms valid in their society and\nthat they cooperate in maintaining the ritual and moral \u2018interaction order\u2019 of their\nsocial life; 188 Understanding pragmatics\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that the study of interaction must consider the whole social situation, the specific\ncontexts in which they are rooted and on which they depend;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that members of a community use commonsense practices and shared rules of\ninterpretation as a means of practical reasoning to constitute, understand and\nmake sense of their social world; and\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that conversation in interaction is a highly \u2013 and probably universally \u2013 ordered\nand structurally organized activity \u2018in which participants co-construct meaning\nand social action in an exquisitely timed choreography of interlocking\ncommunicative moves\u2019 (Mark Dingemanse [p.c.]); the understanding of the\nmeaning of these moves in specific speech communities, however, requires\ncultural knowledge.\nChapter Six has shown that politically aware linguists point out:\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that an adequate description of a language demands knowledge of the social\nstructure of its speakers; therefore, language must be studied in its social context\nwith a strong emphasis on the specific speech situation and the social background\nand significance of the communicative interaction and the speakers involved;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that language varieties are emblems of social identity; they not only mark group\nmembership and solidarity, and thus have important bonding functions, they also\nindex a speaker\u2019s position within her or his speech community with respect to\nsocial rank; moreover, they also segregate others who lack an adequate command\nof the verbal skills that are characteristic for the group members\u2019 verbal interactions;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that language use and language ideology are crucial for the creation of sociocultural\nidentity and normative for the regulation of social relations between specific\nspeech groups in public interactions;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that linguistic ideologies also have the function to legitimize power relations\nbetween group members and the distribution of power within a speech community\nas a whole. They control the political conditions within speech communities and\nproper conduct and behaviour of their members;\n(cid:120)(cid:3) that the understanding of a society\u2019s linguistic ideologies is crucial for a proper\nunderstanding and adequate linguistic analysis of a number of verbal interactions\nand phenomena to be observed in group relations within a speech community.\nThese characteristic features of some of the core domains of the discipline provide\nample evidence for the fact that linguistic pragmatics is rather a \u2018transdiscipline\u2019 that\nbrings together and interacts with a rather broad variety of other disciplines within the\nhumanities. These disciplines share with pragmatics the fundamental interest in\nhuman social (inter)action and the joint creation of meaning. Being a transdiscipline,\npragmatics is also cross-linguistically and cross-culturally oriented; therefore it\nfocuses on culture-specific and language-specific differences in actual language use\nand understanding. Here the question of how cultural, situative and interpersonal Understanding pragmatics 189\ncontext and culture- and language-specific norms and conventions contribute to\nmeaning (and understanding) in actual language use are central.\nThe cross-linguistic/cross-cultural orientation of pragmatics has revealed that the\ntheories developed in this field are predominantly rooted in West-European and\nAnglo-American traditions. Thus, in some cases, theories which claim to have\nuniversal validity \u2013 like the theories of Searle and Grice discussed in Chapter One \u2013 are\nfalsified when they are confronted with non-Indo-European languages. This has led to\nincreased \u2018skepticism in relation to the universality of theories and findings\u2019 within\npragmatic circles which resulted in the recent emerging of the \u2018\u201cemancipatory\npragmatics\u201d movement ... which focuses precisely on the cultural embeddedness of\nanalytical concepts and which ... consciously applies specific non-western notions of\nlanguage use in theory building and empirical research\u2019 (Verschueren 2011: 5). In the\nfinal section of this book some basic ideas of this new movement are presented in a\nbrief outlook on future developments within pragmatics.\n7.3 A BRIEF OUTLOOK ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE DISCIPLINE:\nEMANCIPATORY PRAGMATICS\nIn their programmatic essay \u2018Towards an emancipatory pragmatics\u2019 William Hanks,\nSachiko Ide and Yasuhiro Katagiri ask the following provocative questions:\nWhat would happen ... were we to apply a concept like the Japanese wakimae\n\u201cdiscernment\u201d to a language like Yukatec Maya or English? Could we productively use\nthe Maya concept of the speaker\u2019s body space, called iknal, to describe Japanese, Thai,\nLao or IGui? ... What could honorific usage and interpretation in Thai or Japanese tell\nus about languages like English or Finnish? On first appearance, these may seem\nquixotic questions, since the concepts cited are deeply rooted in their own specific\ncultures, and applying them directly to another appears inappropriate. Yet, when\nEuro-American concepts like information exchange and speech act forces are applied\nto languages like Maya, Thai, Japanese and so on, they are assumed to be appropriate.\nThis discrepancy is indicative of the mostly one-way flow of received theory and\ndescription, from Euro-America to the rest. The result is that different non-Western\nlanguages tend to be compared and juxtaposed only in a metalanguage that is itself\nresolutely Western. We question that unidirectional flow in order to provincialize\nstandard theory, to show that it is ultimately a projection of a particular, historically\nspecific view of the world.\n(Hanks et al. 2009a: 2)\nWith the emancipatory pragmatics movement these scholars and a gradually growing\ngroup of other researchers want to \u2018break free from the constraints of established\nparadigms and to multiply the sources of theory\u2019 (Hanks et al.: 2009a: 2). They see\ntheir approach to pragmatics as \u2018emancipatory ... in the sense of freeing analysis from\nthe confines of theoretical orthodoxies grounded in dominant thought and practice\u2019\n(Hanks et al. 2009a: 2).1 Their project is \u2013 necessarily \u2013 both interdisciplinary and 190 Understanding pragmatics\ntransdisciplinary, with a strong focus on cross-linguistic/cross-cultural difference of\nlanguage use and multimodal interactions between members of the speech\ncommunities being investigated. The contributions in two special issues of the Journal\nof Pragmatics (see Hanks et al. 2009b; Hanks et al. 2012) provide interesting and\npromising examples for this new direction in pragmatics.\nNOTE\n1 For a discussion of the term \u2018emancipatory pragmatics\u2019 see Mey (2012: 705f.).
