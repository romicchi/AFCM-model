CHAPTER 1: PLANTS IN OUR LIVES | 1\nCHAPTER 1: PLANTS IN OUR LIVES\nIn Chapter 1, you\u2019ll discover what horticulture is and how it relates to other disciplines\nthat involve the cultivation of plants, and take a deep dive into the different types of\nscientific experimentation. Then you\u2019ll explore some of the plant parts that you eat, so\nyou can start thinking about the plants that are all around us and how we use them in\nour daily lives.\nPlants contribute to our\nlives in countless ways:\nfrom the foods we eat to\nthe clothes we wear,\nfrom the structures we\nbuild to the flowers we\ngrow in our gardens.\nDavid Mark. Pixabay\nlicense 2 | CHAPTER 1: PLANTS IN OUR LIVES\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define horticulture and describe its disciplines and sub-specialities.\n\u2022 Apply the principles of experimental design to your own experiments in this course and in\ndaily life.\n\u2022 Use biological language to describe the parts of the above-and below-ground plants parts\nthat contribute to your diet. 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE? | 3\n1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE?\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this section you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define the term horticulture.\n\u2022 Describe disciplines related to horticulture.\n\u2022 Describe some of the specialties in the field of horticulture. 4 | 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE?\nLance Cheung. Public domain\nHorticulture and related disciplines\nHorticulture\nHorticulture is the art and science of the development, sustainable production,\nmarketing, and use of high-value, intensively cultivated food and ornamental plants. The\nword is derived from the Latin words hortus (garden plant) and cultura (tilling the soil).\nHorticulture includes ornamental and food plants that are grown with intensive and\nindividualized care, and often in a small space rather than in an expansive field. 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE? | 5\nHorticultural plants overview\nOrnamental plants Food plants\nFlowers, ornamental shrubs, ornamental trees,\nThe plants producing the vegetables and fruits\nturfgrass, native grasses, and forbs are all\nwe eat are all horticultural plants.\nhorticultural plants.\nThey have a high value per acre and, like the\nThey all have a fairly high value per acre. ornamental plants, require intensive\nmanagement.\nAgronomy\nAgronomy is another term commonly used in reference to food production, and refers to\nthe management of plants grown over large areas with less intensive management than\nthat normally provided to garden plants. Its etymology is from the Greek agros (= field)\nand nomos (~management). Agronomy fields are larger than gardens, so the plants grown\nin these fields are less intensively and individually managed than those in most gardens.\nIt is estimated that a single agronomy farm produces food for over 150 people. 6 | 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE?\nAgronomy refers to large scale production of commodity crops like grains. Photo by huntz. CC\nBY-NC-ND 2.0\nExtensive agronomic crop production requires fewer person-hours of management per\nacre than intensive horticultural production, which requires more person-hours of\nmanagement. In contrast, agronomy refers to management of field crops such as cereals\n(e.g. corn, wheat, rice, barley) and legumes (e.g. soybeans, common beans, peanuts,\nalfalfa) and a few other high-acreage crops, like cotton. These are typically plants that\nhave a low dollar value per acre, and in many cases the crops are used for animal feed\nrather than for direct human consumption. These are grown over extensive areas with\nless intensive management, or at least with fewer people per acre involved in managing\nthe crop than would be typical of horticultural crops.\nForestry\nForestry is the science or practice of propagating, planting, managing, and caring for\nforests, and of harvesting products from them. Forestry, which focuses on trees for\nbuilding materials, pulp, and paper, is a third type of plant-production system, considered\nseparately from horticulture and agronomy, and is not covered in this course. 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE? | 7\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is the science or practice of\nfarming, including cultivating soil for\ngrowing crops and rearing animals to\nprovide food, fiber, and other products.\nThe term is derived from the Latin ager\n(field) and cultura (tilling the soil). While\nthe Latin root means \u201cfield\u201d and implies a\nlarger land area than \u201cgarden,\u201d\n\u201cagriculture\u201d typically encompasses both\nhorticulture and agronomy. For instance,\nthe University of Minnesota College of\nFood, Agricultural and Natural Resource Agriculture encompasses all farming practices, including this\nlarge-scale strawberry operation in Argentina. Photo from\nSciences (UMN CFANS) includes both the World Bank Photo Collection. CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nDepartment of Horticultural Science and\nthe Department of Agronomy and Plant Genetics. There is, however, no hard, distinct line\nseparating horticulture and agriculture. While horticulture deals with plants you might\nfind in a garden, it\u2019s common to find those same plants (like vegetables and fruits) grown\nin large fields and harvested in volumes sufficient to supply grocery stores. Other\nornamental garden plants, such as annual and perennial flowers, ornamental shrubs, and\ntrees, are planted in extensive, designed landscapes. Field corn used for animal feed is\nconsidered an agricultural crop, while sweet corn is considered a horticultural crop, yet\nthey are the same species of plant.\nHere is a summary of terms:\n\u2022 Horticulture: Requires intensive management on fewer acres and higher human\ninput per acre, and produces a higher value per acre. Includes ornamental plants\nand whole foods (like those found in the produce aisle).\n\u2022 Agronomy: Requires extensive production on more acres with lower human input\nper acre, and produces a lower value per acre. Includes animal feed and processed\nfood ingredients, (such as oil, protein, sugar, and starch).\n\u2022 Agriculture encompasses both horticulture and agronomy. 8 | 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE?\nDomesticated plants and wild plants\nThe plants grown in horticulture and agronomy are usually domesticated rather than wild,\nmeaning that humans have selected them, intentionally or unintentionally, for particular\ncharacteristics such as adaptation to cultivation in a garden, large showy flowers, or large,\nsweet fruits. You will learn about the science of plant improvement and domestication in\nthe section on plant breeding.\nBecause garden plants are grown in modest-sized spaces, the gardener can provide\nintensive management such as a complex garden design, special care for the soil and\nplant health, and regular weed control.\nIn general, then, \u201chorticulture\u201d refers to domesticated ornamental and food plants that\nhumans grow in modest-sized spaces where they provide intensive management.\nHorticulture and plant propagation\nScience of plants\nPlant science explores how a plant is put together and how\nits parts work together during a plant\u2019s life cycle \u2014 from\nseed to seed.\nThroughout this course, you will study plant structure,\ngrowth, and reproduction, applying what you learn to\nplant propagation practices in the lab portion of this\ncourse.\nRooting stem cuttings is a common\npropagation technique. Photo by\nLaura Irish.\nScience in our lives\nFor many of you, this course might be the only science course you take. The course\ntherefore goes beyond the subject of plants to help you to see the world as a scientist\nmight see it. Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the\nform of testable explanations based on observations and predictions. 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE? | 9\nYou will learn how to propagate plants, and learn about plant structure and function. But\nperhaps more importantly, you will learn about science as a way of understanding and\nappreciating the world around you \u2014 in this case, the horticultural world around you.\nReview questions\n1. What is the difference in meaning between the Latin words hortus and agros?\n2. Differentiate among horticulture, agronomy, and agriculture.\n3. In general, which would you expect to provide the highest value per hour of human\nmanagement: horticultural plants like vegetables, or agronomic commodity crops like corn?\nHorticulture specialties\nWithin the industry, and also within universities, horticulture is often subdivided into\nspecialties according to the use of the plant or plant part that is produced. Here are six of\nthese specialties:\n\u2022 Breeding and genetics: development of new cultivars (cultivated varieties) of plants\nfor production via sexual reproduction.\n\u2022 Floriculture: production and marketing of plants valued for their flowers and\npropagated by seed or by cuttings.\n\u2022 Landscape horticulture: production, marketing, and maintenance of plants used in\ndesigned and managed landscapes.\n\u2022 Olericulture: production and marketing of plants or plant parts valued for culinary\nuse as vegetables.\n\u2022 Pomology: production and marketing of plants or plant parts valued for their\nculinary use as fruits including nuts. 10 | 1.1 WHAT IS HORTICULTURE?\n\u2022 Post-harvest management: development of practices that maintain quality and\nprevent spoilage of harvested horticultural plants or plant parts during storage and\ntransportation.\nReview and looking ahead\nPlant propagation refers to plant multiplication, or making many plants from just a few.\nTwo broad categories of multiplication will be addressed in this course:\n\u2022 Asexual reproduction: ausing new plants to arise from plant parts like leaves,\nstems, or roots, or from storage organs like tubers or rhizomes.\n\u2022 Sexual reproduction: making new plants from spores or seeds.\nReview questions\n1. Name two or three plants you have eaten in the last few days that are studied in pomology.\n2. Name two or three plants you have eaten in the last few days that are studied in olericulture. 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 11\n1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this section you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe why science is considered a discipline of philosophy.\n\u2022 Summarize the four basic types of experiments.\n\u2022 Apply the principles of experimental design in this course and in your daily life.\nThinking about science\nThe primary goal of this section is to help you think about the nature of science. You might\nbe taking this course to fulfill an undergraduate requirement for a biology course with a\nlab. This course fulfills that requirement because we investigate the process behind using\nscience as a way of learning about the natural world around us. If you\u2019re starting down the\npath to becoming a plant scientist, understanding the nature of science will be essential\nfor you in your career\nRegardless of whether you\u2019re going to pursue a career as a scientist, now is a good time\nreflect on the nature of science, and to understand how scientific thinking can become a\nstrategy for resolving many issues that you confront during daily life.\nWatch this video about connecting science and experimentation to real life: 12 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=94#oembed-1\nScientific inquiry\nWhile \u201cscience\u201d is a word commonly used in our culture, in popular use it is rarely spoken\nof as a philosophy. By identifying science as a philosophy we are taking an epistemic view,\none focusing on how knowledge is acquired.\nAt its core, science is a mode of inquiry: a way of acquiring new knowledge about the\nworld around us and a strategy for understanding the inner workings of elements in that\nworld. Scientists believe that if we follow the principles of this philosophy we will continue\nto expand our knowledge about how things work in the world around us. This systematic\napproach is called the \u201cscientific method.\u201d\nThere are two key steps in the scientific method:\n\u2022 Hypothesis building through reflective observation.\n\u2022 Hypothesis testing through experimentation.\nA \u201chypothesis\u201d is a question or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited\nevidence and used as a starting point for experimentation. Experimentation is commonly\nequated with science\u2014rightly so, because hypotheses evaluated on the basis of evidence\ngenerated through experiments. Experimentation, however, isn\u2019t the whole story.\nScience\u2014including the development and testing of new hypotheses\u2014is also a creative\nendeavor.\nWatch this video about scientific inquiry: 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 13\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=94#oembed-2\nScientific inquiry has generated a vast body of knowledge about the world around us.\nYour school science classes might have required you to memorize facts and relationships,\nand pay attention to detail. Sometimes such memorization leads students to believe that\nscience is just an accumulation of facts rather than the process behind discovering all of\nthat information.\nScientific discovery builds on what is already known. Even the most accomplished\nscientists initially approach a problem by learning what is already known. Armed with\nthat information, they then apply their own creativity to form new hypotheses about\nsomething they have observed, and design experiments to test those hypotheses. They\nalso communicate their results publicly so that others can benefit from their work and\nhave the opportunity to challenge conclusions. In this way, science builds on itself.\nThe foundational knowledge you learn in science classes prepares you to develop and test\nhypotheses and to make new discoveries of your own. While a good memory may help\nyou pass a science classes, you will absorb a body of knowledge more effectively when you\nlearn how facts fit and work together in systems rather than learning through the brute\nforce of memorization.\nIn this section we work from the point of view that science is a way of acquiring\nknowledge\u2014a mode of inquiry\u2014and that this mode of inquiry follows a process called the\nscientific method. Those who follow the philosophy of science:\n\u2022 Use it to understand how the natural world works.\n\u2022 Start by learning what is already known.\n\u2022 Carefully observe the subjects of their scientific inquiry and look for details about\nform, function, and interaction with the environment.\n\u2022 Develop hypotheses about the inner workings of natural phenomena not yet\nunderstood.\n\u2022 Test their hypotheses by making observations, conducting experiments and\ncollecting and evaluating evidence.\n\u2022 Communicate with others about their hypotheses, experiments, and the outcomes 14 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nof their studies so that others can repeat, validate, and build upon their work.\nAlthough science is typically used to understand how the natural world works, it is also\nregularly applied to the development of new technologies that are based on these natural\nphenomena and to the solving of problems associated with the natural world.\nPutting the scientific method to work\nAs noted, the scientific method relies on building hypotheses and then testing them\nthrough experimentation. In the lab section of this course you will develop hypotheses\nabout the effects of various treatments on propagation success and then conduct\nexperiments to test those hypotheses. Because experimentation is such a key component\nof the scientific method, we\u2019ll spend time characterizing and examining four types of\nexperimentation and explore whether they are part of the scientific method. While each\nis valuable when applied in the right circumstances, only one clearly follows each step of\nthe scientific method to uncover new knowledge about the natural world.\nTypes of experiments\nThe types of experimentation we will cover are:\n\u2022 Demonstration\n\u2022 Evaluation\n\u2022 Exploration\n\u2022 Discovery 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 15\nDemonstration experiments\nDemonstration experiments are a\nclassic method used in educational\nsettings to help students learn and\nunderstand known relationships already\ndiscovered by others. Learners will usually\nhave had prior exposure to the\nrelationships through preliminary\nobservations, lectures, reading, and\ndiscussions, and will have some sense of\nwhat the experimental outcome might be.\nGood demonstration experiments actively\ninvolve the learner, who manipulates the\nMany experiments conducted in lab courses are demonstration\nexperimental materials, applies the experiments. Photo by Salish Sea Expeditions. CC BY-NC-ND\n2.0\ntreatments, and observes the outcomes,\nthen gathers, analyzes, and interprets the resulting data. Poor demonstration\nexperiments, in contrast, make learners only passive witnesses to something done by an\nexpert at the front of the classroom.\nIn the plant propagation labs for this course, you will be actively engaged in\ndemonstration experiments. Although you won\u2019t be creating new knowledge, the\nknowledge will likely be new to you. The hands-on experience of conducting the\nexperiments will help you to learn the concepts more effectively than if you only read\na textbook or listened to a lecture. The techniques you learn and use in demonstration\nexperiments often contribute to the learning experience as much as the relationships\nrevealed at the experiment\u2019s conclusion. Employing these techniques will help you gain an\nunderstanding of many biological functions, such as the production of adventitious roots\nand mechanisms for seed dispersal.\nWhile demonstration experiments are valuable for actively learning a body of scientific\nknowledge previously discovered and communicated by others, the experience is\nspecifically orchestrated for teaching and learning, not for the discovery of new\ninformation. Yet since the knowledge is new to the learner, it can still bring the joy of\npersonal discovery and a sense of accomplishment.\nIn summary, demonstration experiments: 16 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\n\u2022 Are designed for teaching and learning.\n\u2022 Address relationships that may be new to you, but are otherwise known.\n\u2022 In their best forms, actively involve the learner.\n\u2022 May emphasize experimental techniques, in addition to outcomes, as part of the\nlearning experience.\n\u2022 Are not the types of experiments that are at the core of practicing science as a way\nto uncover new knowledge.\nEvaluation experiments\nEvaluation experiments are designed to help us make decisions, and to choose from\na number of options. They might, for instance, help us determine the efficacy of a new\ntreatment relative to a known treatment, or decide on further experimentation. An\nevaluation experiment will highlight a compound, a technique, a piece of equipment, or\nan organism, and will include a control and/or other alternatives.\nEvaluation experiments are common in horticultural and agronomic research, where the\npurpose of the experiment is to identify, for example, the best cultivar, production\nmethod, pest control, fertility regime, or light intensity for growing a crop. Correct\nexperimental design is crucial for assuring that conclusions from the experiment are\nmeaningful and credible. 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 17\nThis field experiment is testing different living mulches between rows of strawberries. Photo by University of Minnesota West\nCentral Research and Outreach Center.\nThese experiments are typically used in the development of new technologies to identify\nthe best method for the desired purpose (e.g., which pesticides are effective against the\ntarget insect, but not harmful to non-target insects). They are not used to discover new\nknowledge about how the world works, as they typically don\u2019t advance our understanding\nof the natural world. The information from an evaluation experiment might, however,\npoint the way to additional experimentation that does help us discover new knowledge.\nThis is particularly true if the outcome of an evaluation experiment is unexpected or novel.\nIn summary, evaluation experiments:\n\u2022 Are used to help in decision-making. 18 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\n\u2022 Help users choose a winner or determine efficacy relative to other alternatives.\n\u2022 Are commonly used when evaluating and recommending horticultural production\nmethods.\n\u2022 Can be useful in solving problems and developing technologies.\n\u2022 Require proper experimental design (e.g., comparison to a control) for credibility and\nmeaningfulness.\nExploration experiments\nSome scientists specialize in observing and cataloging nature, and some aggressively\nsearch for previously unknown phenomena. In the botanical realm, such scientists study\nthe diversity of organisms within habitats, discover new species, or are in other ways\nvery skilled in \u201cseeing\u201d nature. Explorer-scientists recognize and appreciate detail and can\nidentify the enormous diversity among plants by comparing characteristics that might\nbe overlooked by others. They may also have the capacity to recognize possible\ninterrelationships among organisms and with habitats, making their work particularly\nimportant to science. They might notice, for instance, that a particular species of plant is\ncommonly found in wet areas but not in dry, or that a particular vegetable tastes sweeter\nwhen grown at higher altitudes than when grown closer to sea level. They don\u2019t confirm\nthe cause of these relationships, but are the first to notice them. 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 19\nThis scientist is collecting plants in Ecuador to identify unknown species and to determine relatedness to other plants. Photo by Dr.\nEric Tepe, University of Cincinnati.\nExplorers\u2019 observations are essential to stimulating the development of sound, testable\nhypotheses. The possible relationships they propose must be tested to determine\nwhether those relationships actually exist, or are artifacts of other effects. Explorers\nhelp develop hypotheses, but the work of exploration, cataloging, and seeing possible\nrelationships don\u2019t prove or disprove the hypotheses or necessarily generate new\nknowledge about relationships. The work does, however, result in new information about\nthe existence of the object or phenomenon itself. An exception is exploration done to test\na hypothesis, such as a mission to test the hypothesis that a particular type of ecosystem\nis required for reproduction of a particular plant species.\nScientists must resist jumping to conclusions based on exploration and observation alone.\nIf you see two people together many times, for example, you might conclude that they are\na romantic couple, when in fact they are brother and sister. Relationships hypothesized 20 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nas a result of exploration and observation must be experimentally tested before they are\naccepted or rejected.\nExploration experiments uncover new things, many of which can be exciting and\neventually change our view of the world. While one of their greatest values is that they\nlead to the development of new and stronger hypotheses about how the world works,\nthey go so far as to test those hypotheses or fully engage in the cycle of knowledge\ngeneration associated with the scientific method. Additional experiments based on this\nnew information are required to put this new information in context and to advance our\nunderstanding of how the natural world works.\nIn summary then, exploration experiments:\n\u2022 Focus on detailed observation of organisms and habitats.\n\u2022 Increase our knowledge of the natural world.\n\u2022 Identify potential relationships that need to be tested.\n\u2022 Are essential to sound and testable hypothesis-building.\nDiscovery experiments\nDiscovery experiments are central to the use of the scientific method in tasks ranging\nfrom problem solving to the discovery of new knowledge. They focus on uncovering new\nrelationships and solving problems, follow the scientific method, test hypotheses and\ntheir predicted outcomes, and utilize a careful design in order to maintain meaningfulness\nand credibility.\nThe similarity between the scientific method and Kolb\u2019s Experiential Learning Cycle is not\nan accident. The scientific method is a practical strategy based on how we sense and\nexperience the world around us and used to solve problems encountered during those\nexperiences. 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 21\nThe scientific method is a great example of the experiential learning theory. Illustration by Emily Tepe.\nThe diagram above illustrates a combination of the scientific method and Kolb\u2019s four-\nstep experiential learning, describing a cyclic process for solving problems that can be\napplied to disciplines as diverse as molecular biology, global warming, and even appliance\nrepair. While you might initially think that appliance repair doesn\u2019t belong in that list,\nthe difference is one of application, not method. Though far removed from the esoteric\nscientific discoveries we associate with scientific method, appliance repair follows the\nsame steps. Appliances are often, and quite literally, boxes, where you don\u2019t know what\nis going on inside. But what\u2019s going on inside is knowable, and through that knowledge\ncomes repair. 22 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nThe learning/problem solving/scientific process\ncould theoretically start anywhere in Kolb\u2019s cycle.\nBut it will likely start with a problem that needs to\nbe solved, something you don\u2019t understand but\nwould like to know more about. You become\naware that there is a problem or that you lack\nunderstanding because you have an experience\nwhere you observe something and then step back\nand said, \u201cI wonder how that works,\u201d or perhaps,\n\u201cwhy is that broken?\u201d Through observation you\ndevelop a sufficiently adequate description of the\nproblem to start doing some research on what is\nalready known.\nWith a good description of the problem in hand,\nWe can apply the scientific method to everyday\nproblems like figuring out why a washing machine\nyou can begin to review what is known through the\nisn\u2019t working. Image used with permission \u00a9\nHomeTips.com. work of others, and think about what might be\ngoing on in your situation and how your new\nunderstanding can be applied to the problem. This is \u201creflective observation.\u201d It isn\u2019t just\nsitting back and thinking in a vacuum. You need raw material for your mind to work on,\nand that only comes through the tough task of gathering and engaging with the\nbackground information. There is a very important quiet phase in this process when you\nlet your mind assemble and sort through ideas until alternatives begin to emerge that\nmight lead to a solution. Talking with others and sharing ideas is an important part of this\nquiet phase.\nSometimes the alternatives are no- brainers (blown fuse?), and sometimes they\u2019re more\ncreative (residue from the wrong detergent gunking up the water level sensor?).\nRegardless of their simplicity or complexity, these become hypotheses that need to be\ntested. The hypothesis-building stage includes both a statement of how something works\nor why it isn\u2019t working, and predictions about what might happen if the hypothesis is\ntrue. In appliance repair, for example, the prediction will likely be that the appliance\nwill function normally. In horticultural molecular biology, it might be that you will see\naccumulation of a particular type of fatty acid in the cotyledons.\nYou put the hypothesis to the test by designing an experiment that assesses whether\nyour predictions were right. If the outcome doesn\u2019t match your prediction, you reject the\nhypothesis (the fuse was ok, so that wasn\u2019t the problem). If the outcome does match your 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 23\nprediction, you tentatively accept the hypothesis pending further observation (when the\nfuse was replaced the washing machine worked again, so it might have been a blown fuse,\nbut on the other hand maybe it was just because the motor had time to cool down). As\nwith evaluation experimentation, experimental design is important in assuring that the\nconclusions from the experiment are meaningful and credible.\nExperimentation leads to new experiences and an incremental increase in knowledge, and\nthen the cycle begins again.\nIn summary, discovery experiments:\n\u2022 Focus on uncovering new relationships and solving problems.\n\u2022 Follow scientific method.\n\u2022 Test hypotheses and their predicted outcomes.\n\u2022 Utilize a careful design in order to maintain meaningfulness and credibility.\nSummary\nOf the four types of experiments, only the discovery experiments are core to the process\nof science in the narrow sense of being a way of acquiring new knowledge. The other three\ntypes of experimentation are still important; demonstration and evaluation experiments\nare valuable for learning and decision-making and for technology development, and\nexploration experiments are essential for developing testable hypotheses. But discovery\nexperiments are core to science.\nRemember: the methodology of effective washing machine repair, when applied to what\nis unknown about the physical world, is the methodology of science. It\u2019s not esoteric; it\u2019s\ngood appliance repair.\nYou might argue that, when applied to a broken washing machine, a discovery experiment\nresults in knowledge that is probably already known by those skilled in appliance repair,\nso it isn\u2019t really new knowledge about how the world works. That\u2019s a fair criticism. Use\nof the scientific method can result in new knowledge about how the world works, but\nwhether it uncovers new knowledge depends on the object of experimentation. 24 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nReview questions\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online\nhere:\nhttps://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=94#h5p-3\nExperimental design\nThe methods for designing experiments are carefully studied and often discipline-specific.\nMethods used in molecular biology, for instance, will be somewhat different from those\nused in chemistry or in field evaluations of horticultural plants. There are, however, some\ngeneralizations we can make about good experimental designs.\nEmphasize comparisons\nExperiments include more than just one treatment. \u201cTreatment\u201d refers to the factor that\nyou are varying in your experiment\u2014for example, different cultivars of tomato, different\nfertilizers, or different amounts of light. Experimental designs incorporate comparison of\ntreatments. You usually compare the treatments to one another and often to a control,\nwhich is either the application of no treatment or the application of a customary or\nstandard level of treatment.\nIf you grow a particular type of tomato in your garden, and find that it produces tasty\nfruit, would you declare it to be the best tomato variety you could grow? Certainly not. You\ncouldn\u2019t even say with certainty that it was the best tomato variety you have ever grown\n(unless it is the only one you have grown). Next year, however, you could grow that tomato 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION | 25\nas your control, and grow two other varieties that your neighbors like, and compare fruit\nquality (appearance, flavor, yield, sugar content). You could then say something definitive\nabout the three tomato varieties because you have compared them to each other after\ngrowing them next to each other in the same year and environment.\nReplicate treatments\nThe same treatment is applied to more than one \u201cexperimental unit\u201d\u2014the object that\nreceives the treatment. In the example above, the tomato plant is the experimental unit,\nand you would perhaps plant two or three seedlings of each tomato variety rather than\njust one. Think of a treatment as something like a fertilizer spread on a patch of land. The\npatch of land is the experimental unit, while the fertilizer is the treatment.\nBy applying the treatment to more than one experimental unit you can estimate the\nvariation you get when two experimental units are treated the same, and compare this\nto the variation when experimental units are given different treatments. If the treatments\nactually differ in their effectiveness, you would expect the variation between experimental\nunits given different treatments to be much greater than the variation between those\ngiven the same treatment. This is one of the fundamental ways in which experiments are\nstatistically analyzed and treatments declared significantly different or not.\nRandomize treatments\nOnce you know how many treatments you are going to apply, and how many replications\nyou want, the product of these two quantities (# treatments \u00d7 # replications) equals the\nnumber of experimental units you need. For instance, if you have three fertilizers you\nwant to test, plus a control, you have four treatments. If you want three replications of\neach treatment, then you 4 treatments x 3 replications = 12 experimental units or patches\nof land where you will apply the fertilizers. The treatments will be randomly assigned\nto each experimental unit (patch of land). This is done using a random number table\nand is not just haphazard picking. Randomization helps minimize any bias you haven\u2019t\nrecognized in advance and controlled for in other ways. 26 | 1.2 SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION\nReview questions\n1. What are two types of control treatments?\n2. Does increasing the number of replications increase the number of treatments or the number\nof experimental units?\n3. Can you think of an example of how randomization can protect against bias? 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT | 27\n1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n\u2022 Summarize the various above- and below-ground plant parts that contribute to your diet.\n\u2022 Use the correct language of biology when identifying parts of plants.\n\u2022 Appreciate the diversity of edible plant parts.\nAbove-ground plant parts we eat\nEdible leaves and petioles\nIn this image of an iceberg lettuce cut in half, you can see how the leaf blades are packed\nand folded together tightly in the lettuce head. Lettuce is an example of a plant shoot\nwith very short internodes on the stem. This results in a compact but leafy plant. Iceberg\nlettuce is a type of heading lettuce where older leaves envelop newer leaves forming a\nsolid or semi-solid ball or head of lettuce leaves. 28 | 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT\n\u201cIceberg Lettuce\u201d by \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nRomaine and leaf lettuces exhibit a more open architecture, with the leaves forming a\nlooser head with upright leaves. Romaine lettuce has elongated leaves. There may be\nsome tendency of older leaves to enclose newer leaves, but it is much less pronounced\nthan in iceberg lettuce, and may be absent altogether in some of the garden types. Leaf\nlettuce lacks the tendency to form heads. 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT | 29\nImage by Peter Drache. Pixabay license\nLettuce leaves generally lack a petiole. The blade narrows a bit, but attaches directly to\nthe node. A leaf lacking a petiole is called a \u201csessile\u201d leaf. The point of attachment of the\nleaf to the stem is at a node. If you tear the leaves from a lettuce plant you are left with a\nshort stem made up of many nodes and short internodes.\nYou can see in the romaine lettuce that its morphology is similar to that of the iceberg\nlettuce and that it has some tendency to wrap newer leaves within older. However, the\nnodes are a bit longer than what you see in iceberg lettuce, and that makes the node\nlocations more apparent.\nA few examples of leaf parts we eat\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The parts that you eat are the petioles, while\nthe leaf blades are often not present in the bunch of celery you purchase. If you buy a\nbunch of celery and pull off the large, outside petioles, inside you will find shorter petioles\nwith the leaf blades still attached.\nCelery is a geophyte (covered in a later lesson). Some of the celery petiole \u2014 the pale\npart at the bottom where it attaches to a node on the stem \u2014 grows underground. This\npart is pale because it lacks chlorophyll; the petioles were not exposed to sunlight and\nchlorophyll failed to develop.\nIntentionally covering the petioles to discourage chlorophyll and encourage white, tender\nstems is called blanching. Blanched celery is more attractive to some cooks and\nconsumers, although it may not be as nutritious.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can tell it is a shoot by the regular\nnode/internode construction of the stem. Most of the shoot is stem tissue. The triangular\ngrowth at each node is colloquially called a \u201cbract\u201d by asparagus growers, but it is actually\na very small, scale-like leaf. If the shoots are left unharvested, branches grow from the\nnodes and then repeatedly branch into soft, feathery green foliage, as shown in the next\nphoto. 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT | 31\nImage by Mark\u2019s Postcards from Beloit, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0. 32 | 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT\nAsparagus shoots that are not harvested grow taller and produce branches and feathery\nfoliage.

The dark green exterior 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT | 33\nof the broccoli inflorescence is made up of tight flower (or floret) buds that have not\nyet opened. The term \u201cfloret\u201d is often used for the name of a flower born on a complex\ninflorescence.\nPhoto by Fir0002/Flagstaffotos, CC BY-NC.\nInside the inflorescence, the flower buds are supported by short, thin pedicels. The\npedicel is attached to a series of increasingly thick internal stalks which make up the rachis\nstructure of the inflorescence. The rachi all connect to the main stem of the inflorescence,\nwhich is the peduncle, and which then attaches to a node on the stem. The peduncle\nis the bit of the stalk that extends from the node where the inflorescence is attached to\nwhere the first rachis branches off. Above that, the central axis of the inflorescence is also\ncalled the rachis. An inflorescence can contain many rachi.\nThese plant parts may look similar, but they\u2019re in different positions in the inflorescence.\nThe terminology is important for distinguishing between parts, making observations, and\ndescribing different aspects of the plant, especially for data collection in experiments. 34 | 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT\nNasturtium flowers and leaves are edible.

In this case we are eating a single\nopen flower, instead of a mass of immature rachi, pedicels, and florets as we are with\nbroccoli.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that not all flowers are edible, and some are even poisonous.\nIf you\u2019re interested in edible flowers, you must learn which species are safe to eat and how\nto identify and prepare them.\nReview questions 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT | 35\nCauliflower has very tight flower clusters, but otherwise has a very similar morphology to broccoli.\nCan you identify the pedicel, rachis, peduncle, and florets?\nCauliflower. alsen.\nPixabay license\nThis Chinese cabbage has a morphology similar to that of romaine lettuce.

Many of these\nplants protect buds using structures other than bulbs, such as rhizomes or enlarged\nroots. These modified parts include:\n\u2022 Bulbs\n\u2022 Tubers\n\u2022 Rhizomes\n\u2022 Roots, including storage and enlarged tap roots\nUnderground shoots\nBulb \u2013 onion\nA bulb is a specialized, underground organ with\na short, fleshy basal stem enclosed by thick,\nfleshy scales modified for storage. A true bulb\nconsists of both leaf and stem tissue. The\ncompressed stem, or basal plate, has attached\nto it a set of modified leaves called scales.\nThese scales serve as the primary storage\ntissue for carbohydrates, nutrients, and water.\nThe main stem and apical meristem are\nprotected by the layers of leaves.

Bulbs with a papery outer\ncovering, like onions, are called tunicated. Plants that produce bulbs without this covering,\nlike lilies, are non-tunicated. 38 | 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT\nUnderground stems\nTuber \u2013 potato\nA tuber is a thickened, enlarged\nunderground stem typically produced\nfrom a swelling of a stolon or rhizome. The\nstem tissue serves as the primary storage\ntissue for carbohydrates, nutrients, and\nwater. The potato tuber is a typical\nexample. Potato tubers are born on\nstolons that emerge from nodes near the\nsoil surface.\nRusset potato cultivar with sprouts. ZooFari. Public domain\nIt is common garden and agricultural\npractice to \u201chill\u201d potatoes (mound loose soil around the base of the main stem of the plant)\nso the stolon grows into the mound of soil, where the tip swells into a tuber. Unlike a\ncorm, which is also stem tissue, a tuber has no basal plate, but rather is fleshy throughout.\nThe \u201ceyes\u201d of the potato are the meristems or buds from which new, above-ground growth\ninitiates when conditions are favorable. These eyes are found at nodes on the tuber, which\nindicates that the tuber is shoot tissue rather than root. 1.3 PLANT PARTS WE EAT | 39\nRhizome \u2013 ginger\nRhizomes are horizontal-growing underground\nstems that arise from nodes at or below the soil\nsurface. In plants with fleshy rhizomes, these\nunderground stems store nutrients and swell a\nbit. The stems are not usually as enlarged as a\npotato tuber, and the node/internode structure\ntypical of stems is usually more obvious than on\na potato. The stem tissue itself is the primary\nstorage tissue, and it grows horizontally in the\nsoil.\nGinger \u201croot\u201d (shown at right) isn\u2019t really a root;\nit\u2019s a rhizome (modified stem).

Binomial nomenclature is more precise; its use\nensures that you\u2019ll get the correct plant and the correct information on how to grow and\npropagate it.\nThe second section in this chapter addresses seed germination, arguably the most\ncommon and important method of propagating plants. 48 | CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND SEED GERMINATION\nGarden centers and nurseries tend to use common plant names, but knowing the scientific names will eliminate confusion. \u201cLangley\nCircle Farm Tour: Cedar Rim Nursery Plants Galore\u201d by Queenie C, CC BY-NC 2.0\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 List the seven levels of the plant classification system.\n\u2022 Recognize the taxonomic diversity of common foods in your diet.\n\u2022 Summarize the contribution of Linneaus to binomial nomenclature.\n\u2022 Understand how the two-part scientific naming system works and its applications.\n\u2022 Describe the differences between epigeal and hypogeal seedling emergence. 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY | 49\n2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this section you will be able to:\n\u2022 List the seven levels of the plant classification system.\n\u2022 Recognize the taxonomic diversity of common foods in your diet.\n\u2022 Summarize the contribution of Linneaus to binomial nomenclature.\n\u2022 Understand how the two-part scientific naming system works and its applications.\nPlant taxonomy\nHere are some introductory definitions:\nTaxonomy (or systematics): The science of classifying organisms.\nClassification: A grouping of plants according to shared qualities or characteristics.\nPlant taxonomy: A hierarchical classification system based on morphological (see below)\nand phylogenetic (see below) similarities among plants.\nNomenclature: A formal system of names attached to taxonomic groupings.\nHierarchy: A system of grouping in which each classification is a subset of a superior\ngrouping, and may contain subordinate categories. As an example: The landmass of\nthe United States (used here as the highest or most inclusive level of classification) is\npartitioned into states (a middle level of classification). States, in turn, are partitioned 50 | 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY\ninto counties (the lowest level in this hierarchy). Counties are subsets of states, which are\nin turn subsets of the nation. This hierarchical type of grouping system is used in plant\ntaxonomy.\nMorphology: The appearance (shape and structure) of a plant. Plant taxonomy is a\nhierarchy primarily based on grouping together plants that exhibit structural (phenotypic)\nsimilarities.\nPhylogeny: Ancestral, evolutionary relationships among plants. While plant taxonomy\nhas historically been based on plant morphology, these relationships are currently being\nverified and expanded using new molecular genetic technologies that uncover genetic\nsimilarities through comparisons of shared DNA sequences. In general, plants sharing\nmore DNA are considered more similar from an evolutionary standpoint, and considered\nto have diverged from each other more recently in evolutionary time than plants that\nshare less DNA.\nTaxonomy in the pantry: Classification exercise\nTo start becoming familiar with taxonomic\ncategories, go to your fridge, cupboard, or\npantry and choose a variety of fruits,\nvegetables, and grains. These might\ninclude cans of mushrooms, green peas,\nblack-eyed peas, chickpeas, butter beans,\nand sweet corn; bags of pine nuts and\ncoconut, and perhaps a banana.\nThink about the many ways in which you\ncould group these foods. You might, for\ninstance, categorize a food by whether it is\ncanned or fresh, by size, manufacturer,\n\u201cFood on shelf\u201d by Jaranda, CC BY-SA 2.0\ncolor, or by the meal in which you would\ntypically eat it.\nOr you could apply a biological, hierarchical classification system, categorizing them by\nthe morphology and phylogeny of the plant on which they grew. The plant systematics\nhierarchy we will use in this course is as follows, from highest (most inclusive) to lowest\nlevel: 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY | 51\n\u2022 Kingdom\n\u2022 Division (or Phylum, although Phylum is more commonly associated with animal\ntaxonomy)\n\u2022 Class\n\u2022 Order\n\u2022 Family\n\u2022 Genus\n\u2022 Specific epithet (usually a species name)\nMemorize this hierarchy, so it rolls off your tongue like a multiplication table.\nNow apply this taxonomic system to your foods. An easy way to do this is to search for\neach food on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s site USDA Plants Database. If you type\n\u201ctomato\u201d into the search bar, select \u201cCommon Name\u201d from the dropdown menu, and\nclick \u201cgo,\u201d you\u2019ll see all the plants with \u201ctomato\u201d in their common name.

Scroll down to see the \u201cClassification\u201d section, which lists the taxonomic\nclassification and includes Kingdom, Division, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Specific\nepithet. Notice that this database has finer divisions of hierarchy than you are required to\nknow, including Subkingdom, Superdivision, and Subclass. 52 | 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY\nHere\u2019s a look at how you can use the USDA Plants Database to find the full classification of plants, like tomato. Try it out!\nYou can use the information in the database to classify your foods. For products with\nseveral ingredients, pick one from the ingredient list, such as wheat in crackers or tomato\nin spaghetti sauce.\nWhile you can sometimes find this info on Wikipedia, be aware that Wikipedia is not\nalways reliable and you\u2019ll want to cross-reference with other sources. If you enter \u201ctomato\u201d\ninto the Wikipedia search bar you\u2019ll get this page. The right sidebar includes the taxonomic\nclassification. \u201cUnranked\u201d is used instead of Division and Class, which means there is some\ndisagreement on whether those names are the correct Division or Class names. You 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY | 53\nmight also see several hierarchical terms listed as \u201cClade,\u201d rather than the proper terms.\nIf you can\u2019t find complete information on Wikipedia, use the USDA site.\nFor the foods in our hypothetical pantry \u2014 mushrooms, green peas, black-eyed peas,\nchickpeas, butter beans, sweet corn, pine nuts, coconut, and banana \u2014 we can divide\nthem into the following Kingdoms: Plantae and Fungi.\nWe can separate the products within the Plantae kingdom into two Divisions:\n\u2022 Pinophyta: the pine nuts, which come from a conifer\n\u2022 Magnoliophyta: everything else in this kingdom, which come from flowering plants\nThe cans and bags in the Magnoliophyta division can be separated into these Classes:\n\u2022 Liliopsida (Monocotyledons \u2014 one embryonic leaf in the seed, parallel leaf veins,\nand petals and sepals in multiples of three): corn, coconut, and banana\n\u2022 Magnoliopsida (Dicotyledons \u2014 two embryonic leaves in seed, and branched leaf\nveins): green peas, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, and butter beans\nIn comparison to the other levels, Order is a relatively arbitrary set of classifications that\nwere created in part to make subsequent classifications more manageable. Order will be\naddressed in the section on phylogeny.\nNext, the products can be subdivided by Family. 54 | 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY\n\u201cPublic Flower Garden in downtown Seattle\u201d by FallenPegasus, CC BY-NC 2.0\nDepending on details of the particular plant classification system used, there are\napproximately 230 plant families. Families are often based on types and organization\nof flower parts and fruit type, including the number of petals, sepals, stamens, and\npistils, and the location of the ovary relative to petals. In this website from the University\nof California Cooperative Extension (optional) the authors identify many of the\ncharacteristics used to group plants into families.\nAmong our food examples, the Family hierarchy includes:\n\u2022 Arecaceae (coconut, which comes from a palm tree)\n\u2022 Poaceae (corn, which is a grass)\n\u2022 Musaceae (banana)\n\u2022 Fabaceae (the three peas and the butter beans, which are legumes) 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY | 55\nGenus and Specific Epithet are the last two classifications. The pairing of genus and\nspecific epithet to name a plant is called binomial nomenclature. Tthe first letter of the\ngenus is capitalized, and the entire binomial is either underlined or written in italics.\nWatch this video for an explanation of plant taxonomy.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Below is an\nexample tree based on some of the foods found in our hypothetical pantry: 56 | 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY\nImage credit: Tom Michaels\nNow, try it yourself. Determine which plants you want to use, look them up on the USDA\nPlants Database, write down the Kingdom, Division, Class, and so on for each, and begin\nconstructing the tree to show relationships and points of divergence. In this example, the\nmushrooms diverge from everything else at the Kingdom level, pine nuts diverge from the\nother three at the Division level, corn is in a different Class than pea and chickpea, and\npea and chickpea diverge at Genus.\nThe point of this exercise is for you to understand that relationships among plants are\nknown, and are categorized in a sophisticated taxonomic system. Some of the plants we\ncommonly eat have close relationships, like the various plants in the Solenaceae family\n(tomato, eggplant, potato), but others are much more distant. 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY | 57\nLinneaus and plant taxonomy\nBinomial nomenclature\nCarolus Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), a Swedish professor, is widely recognized for developing\nthe binomial nomenclature for plants. Binomial nomenclature is a scientific classification\nin which each organism is given two names. In his 1753 book Species Plantarum (kinds\nof plants), Linnaeus employed this system to describe a great number of plants using\nLatin polynomials. The first word of the polynomial became the genus, and a marginal\nnote describing the plant became the specific epithet. Several years ago we celebrated\nLinnaeus\u2019 300th birthday, and you can find a long set of links about him from a simple\nGoogle search.\nA proper binomial, in addition to the Genus and specific epithet, also includes the initials\nof the naming authority \u2014 the person who proposed the accepted name. Previous naming\nauthorities might also be listed in parentheses. For example:\n\u2022 Phaseolus vulgaris L. \u2014 common bean. The \u201cL\u201d stands for Linnaeus.\n\u2022 Phaseolus acutifolius A. Gray \u2014 tepary bean. The authority for this one is A. Gray.\nInterspecific hybrids (hybrids formed from crossing two different species) may be\ndesignated with an \u201cx\u201d separating the two constituent species; the \u201cx\u201d can be read as\nshorthand for \u201ccrossed with\u201d \u2014 for example, Phaseolus vulgaris L. x Phaseolus acutifolius A.\nGray. They might also be given a new name incorporating an \u201cx\u201d to show that the plant\nis the result of an interspecific cross: Fragaria chiloensis x Fragaria virginiana = Fragaria x\nananassa (cultivated strawberry)\nNotice, from these examples of interspecific crosses, that the ability to cross and to\nhave fertile offspring isn\u2019t a firm definition of species. It is generally true that breeding is\nrestricted to within-species boundaries, but there are exceptions.\nWhile some plant names have been updated to reflect the most recent knowledge about\ntheir morphology and phylogeny, their older names might still be in common use in some\nsettings. Coleus, for example, has the following binomials, all for the same plant:\n\u2022 Ocimum scutellarioides L.\n\u2022 Plectranthus scutellarioides (L.) R. Br. (Notice that \u201cL\u201d is now in parentheses, showing\nthat Linneaus was the earliest naming authority, but that his original name for the 58 | 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY\nplant has now been superseded.)\n\u2022 Coleus scutellarioides (L.) Benth.\n\u2022 Coleus blumei Benth.\nImportant notes about binomial naming conventions:\n\u2022 The Genus is always capitalized and either italicized or underlined.\n\u2022 The specific epithet is lowercase and either italicized or underlined.\n\u2022 The naming authority is capitalized and often abbreviated; if the species has been\nrenamed, the first authority is in parentheses.\n\u2022 An \u201cx\u201d between the Genus and specific epithet denotes an interspecific cross.\n\u2022 A \u201cx\u201d before the Genus denotes an intergeneric cross.\nFuture of plant taxonomy and systematics\nTaxonomy might first seem an old and dull science, sorting plants into a database using\na system developed by someone born more than 300 years ago. But plant exploration\nexperiments and the discovery of previously unknown species can take researchers to\nthe far corners of the world, and taxonomy is important in classifying and naming these\nnew discoveries. Also, for already discovered species, there is continual discussion about\nthe real relationships among these plants and others and whether currently classified\nplants should be reclassified based on new information. With advances in molecular\ngenetics through techniques that reveal a plant\u2019s DNA sequence, for example, taxonomy is\nmoving more and more toward a phylogenetic basis, based on evolutionary relationships\nestablished through DNA similarities and differences instead of solely on morphological\ncharacteristics (features about the plant that you can see).\n\u2022 Traditional taxonomy relies on morphological phenotype (the appearance of the\nplant).\n\u2022 Molecular taxonomy relies on genotype (the particular combination of alleles of\neach gene in the organism).\nFor more information, check out this Wikipedia article about molecular phylogenetics.\nThe Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) is a group of taxonomists who are working\ntogether to modify flowering plant taxonomy using molecular systematics. The APG\u2019s work\nis focused at the taxonomic level of Order and, to some extent, Family. While Order 2.1 PLANT TAXONOMY | 59\nhas long been a fairly arbitrary categorization, it may now be based more on molecular\nrelationships.\nThe utility of classification goes beyond the satisfaction of good organization.\nClassification can inform us of new or lesser-studied plants that share valuable\ncharacteristics with plants already familiar to us. Now we have tools and knowledge that\ngive us increasing control over the transfer of DNA among plants. Plant breeders can use\ninsights from taxonomists to identify DNA sequences in related plants that might provide\nnew sources of resistance to disease and insects, or new quality attributes, if transferred\nto food crops.\nReview questions\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The\nstored energy is what makes seeds\nvaluable for humans, too. Seeds are\nimportant in our daily lives because they\nfeed us (food), feed livestock (aka, feed),\nand provide us with fuel and fiber for\npersonal, home, and industrial purposes. \u201cGerminating bean seed\u201d by Jose Ba\u00f1uelos, CC BY-NC 2.0\nSeeds are by far the most common mode by which plants reproduce, and most people are\nfamiliar with their role in plant propagation and reproduction. The evolutionary advantage 2.2 INTRODUCTION TO SEED GERMINATION | 61\nof reproduction by seed is the mixing of genetic material through meiotic recombination\nand the transfer of gametes (pollen) from one parent to another. This mixing of male\nand female parent genetics results in seeds, and thus seedlings, that are unique from\none another and from the parents. The seeds may be dispersed locally or distributed far\naway through many mechanisms, such as wind, animals, insects, and water. Seedlings\nwill germinate and grow, and those that are most fit in the environment will reproduce\nand pass on their genes to the next generation. This ability of plants to adapt to local\nenvironments and to pass on their genes is evolution in action, as new variations and even\nnew species emerge and disappear from the landscape.\nOne advantage of seed production is that plants generally produce copious amounts\nof seed. Each seed may have slightly different germination requirements, a reflection\nof the diversity resulting from sexual recombination and an evolutionary strategy that\nallows seeds to germinate at different times. Seeds are able to remain dormant until the\nconditions are suitable for plant growth and survival, and have mechanisms that prevent\ngermination before winter, during droughts, or in low-light environments. Some weedy\nspecies are excellent at interpreting these signals and may lie dormant for years in the soil\n\u201cseed bank,\u201d only germinating when the seed has been exposed.\nSeedling emergence\nMost seeds have a very slow metabolism when\nthey are mature, which puts them in a state of\nquiescence: alive, but not growing and not\nphysiologically active. At germination, the seed\u2019s\nmetabolic pathways are activated, leading to\nembryo growth and emergence of a new\nseedling. Germination begins with activation by\nwater uptake. We call this imbibition, and\nsometimes the seed or fruit requires special\ntreatment for water to get into the seed and\nstart this process. We often use the emergence\nof the radicle (the embryonic root) from the\nseed coat as a measure of successful\ngermination. Water uptake alone is not an Image credit: Tom Michaels\nindication that the seed is alive and growing,\ndespite the expansion of seed tissues. 62 | 2.2 INTRODUCTION TO SEED GERMINATION\nCell division is taking place in the epicotyl, and the hypocotyl and the shoot and root are\nbeginning to break through the seed coat. The new plant is beginning to grow and emerge\nfrom the soil.\nTwo types of seedling emergence\nEpigeal and hypogeal\nEpigeal and hypogeal are terms used to describe the position of the cotyledonary node\nduring germination, indicating whether the node is above or below ground once the\nseedling has become established.\nEpi means above while Hypo means below. The location of the cotyledonary node\nfollowing seedling emergence is a characteristic used as a first step to differentiate plant\nspecies. The position of the cotyledon is affected by the rapidity of cell division in the\nhypocotyl region of the plant during germination and early seedling growth. The epicotyl\nis the embryonic shoot region above the attachment point of the cotyledons, and the\nhypocotyl the embryonic region below the cotyledon attachment point and extending\ndown to where the root begins.\nEpigeal\nIn this type of seedling emergence, cell division in the hypocotyl is initially more active and\nrapid than cell division in epicotyl. The actively dividing meristem in the hypocotyl causes\ncell growth and elongation that pushes some of the hypocotyl, as well as the cotyledonary\nnode and epicotyl, above the soil surface. The cotyledonary node is above the ground\n\u2014 epigeal. The drawing shows four stages in the emergence of a pinto bean (Phaseolus\nvulgaris L.) which exhibits epigeal germination. 2.2 INTRODUCTION TO SEED GERMINATION | 63\nEpigeal germination.

This cell division and elongation pushes the epicotyl above\nthe soil while the cotyledons and all of the hypocotyl remain below the soil surface. The\ncotyledonary node is below the ground \u2014 it is hypogeal.

Leaves are\nmade up of cells that usually contain a high concentration of chloroplasts (cell organelles\nunique to plants) and are specialized sites for photosynthesis. We will explore\nphotosynthesis in greater detail later; for now, remember that photosynthesis is the\nprocess of capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy that can be stored\nin plants (like starch and sugar). In some plants, leaves may be modified for nutrient\nstorage (as with onions, where the bulb is made up of fleshy leaves), or for support (as\nwith peas, where some leaves are modified into tendrils that wrap around a trellis). 72 | 3.1 LEAVES\nPhoto by yooperann, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nLeaves are also the surface where water that has moved from the soil into the roots\nand up through the plant finally evaporates back into the atmosphere in a process called\ntranspiration. 3.1 LEAVES | 73\nAngiosperms, which are flowering plants whose seeds develop inside an ovary, tend to\nhave flattened leaves. Many perennial angiosperms (flowering plants that can grow for\nmany years) have leaves that senesce, or die, at the end of each growing season and\nare replaced at the beginning of the next growing season. Gymnosperms, plants whose\nseeds are produced without the protection of an ovary, tend to have needle-like leaves.\nPerennial gymnosperms tend to hang on to their leaves for a number of years. This saves\nenergy, since the plant doesn\u2019t need to grow a whole set of new leaves every year. The\nneedle-like form helps retain moisture in harsh, dry climates, including those that are very\ncold and dry.\nLeaf parts and venation\nAngiosperm leaves typically have a blade or lamina, a flattened part with high chloroplast\nconcentration. They may also have a petiole, the stalk that attaches the blade to the stem\nat a node. Stipules, small leaf-like bracts at the point of attachment of the petiole to the\nstem, may also be present. Some leaves have no petiole at all, and are termed sessile.\nIn contrast to the blade-petiole structure, grasses have a sheath-type structure in which\nthe blade attaches to an envelope of leaf tissue that wraps around the shoot of the plant\nand then attaches to a lower node on the stem.\nLeaf blades also have characteristic patterns of venation. In grasses, the veins lie parallel\nto each other and to the long edges of the leaf. We call this parallel venation, and it\nis typical of monocots. Most other angiosperms have a strong major midrib with veins\nbranching from the midrib, smaller veins branching from those, and so on to form a\nnetted venation throughout the leaf. This type of venation is typical of dicots.\nLeaves may also have a palmate venation where several veins radiate from the point\nwhere the petiole attaches to the blade. Ginkgo tree leaves have palmate venation. The\nveins fork, then travel a bit, then fork again, travel, fork, and so on until the veins reach\nthe margin (edge) of the leaf. Sugar maple leaves have a classic palmate venation with five\nlobes. 74 | 3.1 LEAVES\nPhoto by Matt Lavin, CC BY-SA 2.0. 3.1 LEAVES | 75\nLeft: Corn leaves have parallel veins.

The leaf may have lobes like the oak leaf,\nbut the blade has one continuous margin. The venation differs in the two examples below.\nThe oak leaf is pinnate, with a major vein heading down the midrib of the leaf. The maple\nleaf is palmate, with major veins that radiate from the point of attachment to the petiole. 76 | 3.1 LEAVES\nOak leaves have pinnate venation (L), while maple leaves have palmate venation (R).

What you see in the picture \u2014 the\nentire thing \u2014 is one leaf. The leaf is divided or segmented into leaflets. 3.1 LEAVES | 77\nTree of heaven, (Ailanthus altissima) has pinnately compound leaves. Photo by Dr. Leslie J. Mehrhoff, CC BY 3.0.\nThe petiole extends from the point of attachment at the node to the first leaflet. The\ncentral axis from that point on \u2014 from the first leaflet to the tip of the leaf \u2014 is called the\nrachis.\nVirginia creeper is an example of a palmately compound leaf. The stalk that connects\nthe leaflet to the top of the petiole is called the petiolule. In this case there is no rachis;\nall leaflets are attached directly to the top of the petiole. 78 | 3.1 LEAVES\nVirginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) has palmately compound leaves.

The stem can\nbe tall and thick in diameter, like in a\nsunflower, or quite compact and\ncompressed, like in an onion, where the\nstem may never get above the soil surface.\nThe stem can be rigid like a corn stalk or\nfloppy like a watermelon vine. In each\ncase, the stem is the central axis to which\nthe other shoot components attach. The\nstem doesn\u2019t need to be upright; it can\ngrow horizontally.\nWatch this video to see examples and\nparts of shoots:\nSmall tomato plant in a pot.

A node is the\nplace of origin on the stem for branches, leaves, and inflorescences. Sometimes the 3.2 SHOOTS | 83\nnode is slightly swollen and obvious, other times not; it depends on the type of plant.\nLocated at the nodes are buds (a colloquial term; later we\u2019ll call them meristems) made\nup of cells that, given the correct biochemical signal, will rapidly divide and grow into\nbranches, leaves, or inflorescences. More than one bud can grow from a node, so a node\ncan support several structures.\nThis tomato plant has clearly distinguishable nodes and internodes.

At the nodes, some of these pipes diverge from the main bundle to\nprovide nutrients, water, sugars, and other metabolites to the branches, leaves, and\ninflorescences that form at the node.\nBetween nodes are stretches of stem called internodes. One architectural function of the\ninternode is to spatially orient the leaves, branches, and inflorescences. Long internodes,\nfor example, will spread the leaves out along a stem so that they aren\u2019t shading each other\nas much as if the internodes were short. Nodes also help with leaf orientation.\nThe location of nodes determines whether the leaves are located, which is called leaf\narrangement, and leaf arrangement is a characteristic of a particular type of plant.\n\u2022 Alternate \u2014 the leaves are attached at nodes on alternate sides as they go up the\nstem.\n\u2022 Opposite \u2014 the leaves grow directly opposite each other on the stem.\n\u2022 Whorled \u2014 the leaves are oriented in a whorled formation in which their point of\nattachment appears to spiral up the stem. 86 | 3.2 SHOOTS\nPhotos by (L to R) jlevinger, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0; John Tann, CC BY 2.0; Frank Vincentz, CC BY-SA 3.0.\nNodes are important because they are where leaves, branches, and inflorescences\noriginate; the internodes are important because their length has a profound impact on\nplant architecture. 3.2 SHOOTS | 87\nGoldenrod inflorescence. polyphemus_polly.

In the image below, a bud has formed at the apex of the stem. This\nbud contains a meristem that will \u201cbreak\u201d or become active next spring and result in early\nseason stem growth.\nThese cuttings of \u2018Northstar\u2019 cherry were collected from the tips of the twigs, and are called terminal cuttings. Photo by Emily Tepe.\nThe crotch formed between the leaf petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf blade to the 90 | 3.2 SHOOTS\nshoot stem) and the stem or branch is called the leaf axil, and the buds in that crotch are\ncalled axillary buds or axillary meristems. You can see two sets of axillary meristems\nin the image. If pruned above the axillary buds, the plant will grow from these nodes.\nRemoving the apical meristem is one way to encourage branching. If you\u2019ve ever grown\nbasil, you know that snipping or pinching leaves off right above a node encourages more\nleaves to grow from that node. This function also gives plants a way to respond to feeding\ndamage or injury by having dormant buds that can grow when prompted.\nReview questions\n\u2022 Looking a photo of a plant, can you identify the stem, nodes, and internodes?\n\u2022 Can you recognize different types of leaf arrangements on different plants you see?\n\u2022 Buds at the nodes can develop into one or more of three different structures. What are these\nthree structures?\n\u2022 What type of buds are found in the crotch between the leaf petiole and the stem? 3.2 SHOOTS | 91\nStolons and rhizomes\nStolons\nSome types of plants produce branches\nfrom nodes on the stem that are very close\nto, or right at, the soil surface. These\nbranches, which have long internodes and\nlie on the surface of the soil, are called\nstolons. Not all plants produce stolons,\nbut strawberry is a common example of a\nplant that does. The \u201crunners\u201d that extend\nout from the mature strawberry plant are\nin fact stolons. Stolons have the same\nStrawberry plants send out stolons which form new plants at\ntypical repeating node/internode structure the ends. Photo by Emily Tepe.\nof a stem, but unlike other branches of the\nplant, at the nodes of the stolon, adventitious roots can form. Adventitious roots are\nroots that emerge from the stem rather than from roots. Even though they emerge from\nthe stem above ground, they still act like roots. They anchor the stolon to the ground and\nabsorb water and nutrients for the plant\u2019s use. Leaves, and even branches, can also form\nfrom the stolon nodes.\nOne of the main purposes of stolons is to propagate a plant. The mature strawberry plant\nsends out a stolon and a new plantlet forms at the stolon node. Once the plantlet is\nrootedm you can cut the stolon internode between the plantlet and the main stem and\ntransplant the plantlet. For instance, you can start a new patch of strawberry plants by\ncutting off these plantlets and planting them in a bed. 92 | 3.2 SHOOTS\nPotato plants produce underground stolons which swell to form the tubers we eat. oliva732000. CC BY-SA 2.0\nPotato is another plant that produces stolons; in this case the stolons are often below\nground rather than above the soil. Potato tubers (the part that we eat) are formed from\nswellings of these stolons. When we grow potatoes we mechanically hill soil up around the\npotato stem during the growing season to cover the developing tubers, preventing them\nfrom turning green and bitter from exposure to sunlight.\nRhizomes\nRhizomes are another type of stem tissue originating from a node. In this case it is\ntypically a node that is below the surface of the soil. A rhizome also grows horizontally\nand has nodes and internodes, but unlike stolons, it is underground. The ginger in the\nproduce section of the grocery story is misnamed ginger \u201croot,\u201d but is actually a rhizome,\nand you can tell that this is stem tissue because it has nodes and internodes. The nodes\nare the faint, slightly raised rings around the circumference of the rhizome. If you see 3.2 SHOOTS | 93\nnodes and internodes on a plant part, the tissue is stem tissue and not root tissue, even if\nit is underground.\nGreen shoots emerging from an iris rhizome. Science and Plants for Schools. CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nRhizomes and stolons are the exceptions to the general notion that shoot tissue is\nabove the soil surface. They are branches, complete with nodes and internodes, but are\nunderground (rhizomes) or near the soil surface (stolons). They are stem tissue.\nTurfgrass provides an example of rhizomes, stolons, and another structure typically\nassociated with plants in the grass family called tillers.

Roots do have structures but, in contrast to stems and\nbranches, these structures emerge irregularly from the root according to where they are\nneeded, and to some extent according to inherited tendencies, rather than emerging at\nspecific zones the way leaves, branches, and inflorescences emerge from nodes on the\nstem.\nWatch this video for a short intro to roots.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This \u201canchorage\u201d not only\nfacilitates other functions for the plant, but provides a benefit for the soil. An extensive\nroot system helps hold the soil in place so that it is less likely to be eroded by wind or\nrain. Where there are roots the soil tends to be retained. No roots, and the soil easily gets\nwashed or blown away. On the flip side, if conditions are poor the plant can\u2019t pull up roots\nand move somewhere else where prospects for growth are better.\nSupport\nThe roots, particularly the tap root that we examine below, provides the foundation for\nupright growth.\nAbsorption\nRoots are the structure of the plant that absorb water and soluble nutrients..\nSymbiotic interaction with other organisms\nRoots of plants from the taxonomic family Fabaceae \u2014 which are commonly called\nlegumes, and include plants like peas, beans, clover, and locust trees \u2014 can form a\nsymbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria. This results in nitrogen fixation, which\nallows for the conversion of nitrogen from the atmosphere into nitrogen compounds that\nthe plant can use to produce proteins and other building-block molecules. For nitrogen\nfixation to occur, rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen.\nThese bacteria fix nitrogen after becoming established inside root nodules of plants in the\nFabaceae family.\nRoots also develop associations with Mycorrhizal fungi. In contrast to the Rhizobia\nbacteria, which only symbiotically interact with a narrow range of plants, Mycorrhizae\n(mycorrhizae is the plural of mycorrhiza) are fungi that grow in association with roots of\na wide range of plants \u2014 perhaps most plants. The mycorrhizae help acquire phosphorus\nfrom the soil and make it available to the plants\u2019 roots. Mycorrhiza may also enhance\nwater uptake. 98 | 3.3 ROOTS\nWatch this video about symbiotic relationships between roots and soil organisms.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Roots also store\nsome protein and other nutrients, but the focus is typically on high-energy carbohydrates.\nReview questions\n\u2022 What external features clearly differentiate roots from stems?\n\u2022 What purposes do roots serve beyond absorption of water and nutrients?\n\u2022 What are two examples of living organisms that symbiotically interact with roots? How do\nthey differ in terms of the plants they infect and the benefits they provide? 3.3 ROOTS | 99\nRoot systems\nA plant\u2019s root originates in the embryo formed within the seed.\nThe section of the embryo that is root tissue is called the\nradicle (note the spelling). At the tip or apex of the radicle is a\nregion of rapid cell division and growth called an apical\nmeristem (you may recall that shoots have an apical meristem\ntoo). As a result of the apical meristem\u2019s rapid cell division, the\nradicle grows down into the soil. The root that forms from the\nembryonic radicle is called the primary root. This sketch of\nhalf of a peanut seed shows the radicle that is part of the\nembryo inside the seed. The plumule is the embryonic shoot.\nPeanut seed embryo.

This tap or\nprimary root is the central axis off of which lateral or secondary roots branch in irregular\npatterns in response to the availability of high-quality soil \u2014 soil with adequate moisture,\nnutrients, and favorable soil structure (proper particle aggregation and pore space that\nfosters gas exchange and moisture retention). 102 | 3.3 ROOTS 3.3 ROOTS | 103\nDandelion is an example of a plant that has a tap root. See the taproot and many\nsmall secondary roots. Science and Plants for Schools, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nLateral or secondary roots typically grow relatively parallel to the soil surface, while the\nprimary or tap root grows perpendicular to the soil surface. Tertiary roots branch off of\nsecondary roots, again in response to nutrient and moisture availability.\nA tap root system provides strong leverage and anchorage in the soil. If firmly connected\nto an upright stem, the tap root can resist uprooting by wind whipping at the shoot and\nherbivores yanking on the leaves and branches. Both the pigweed and the velvetleaf\npictured here are tall, upright plants. The strong taproot helps provide the underground\nleverage to hold those plants upright.\nFibrous root systems\nFibrous root systems begin the same as tap root systems\u2026with a radicle growing from the\nseed. However, after a period of early growth, the radicle or primary root stops growing\n(or slows its growth) and roots begin to form from the stem tissue that is underground,\nbut just above the primary root. These roots emerging from stem tissue are adventitious\nroots \u2014 indicating that the roots emerge from the main stem. 104 | 3.3 ROOTS\nRed and white onions. Alice Henneman. CC BY 2.0\nIn beans there are two types of adventitious roots. The roots that emerge from the region\njust above where the main stem stops and the root begins are called basal roots (basal\nbecause they are at the base of the main stem). The roots that emerge above these basal\nroots are called hypocotyl roots. As we\u2019ll see in a later chapter, the portion of the stem\njust above the root-shoot transition zone is called the hypocotyl. Adventitious roots that\ncontribute to the fibrous root system stay close to the soil surface. Fibrous root systems\nare excellent at holding soil in place because they are thin, extensive, and weblike. This is\nwhy various types of grasses, which have fibrous root systems, are planted in areas that\nare subject to erosion from flowing water following rains. The fibrous root systems of the\ngrasses, once established, hang on to the soil particles like a web of very thin, interlaced\nfingers. 3.3 ROOTS | 105\nPhoto credit: Tom Michals.\nThe kidney bean root system pictured above has been growing for a few weeks. You can\nidentify the soil line on the stem by where the stem coloration transitions from green\nto cream or buff color. The root doesn\u2019t start immediately after the stem enters the soil.\nInstead, the stem continues underground for about an inch. Notice the point where the\nwidth of the stem drastically reduces; this is where the primary root tissue starts. Again,\nthe primary root traces directly back to the radicle, which is part of the embryo in the seed.\nJust above where the root starts are the basal roots, and above these are the hypocotyl\nroots. As noted above, basal and hypocotyl roots are adventitious roots, as they emerge\nfrom the stem. 106 | 3.3 ROOTS\nIn this picture of Echinopogon ovatus,\nknown as hedgehog grass in its native\nAustralia, you can see the rhizome or\nunderground stem that is typical of\nspreading grasses. Note the nodes on the\nrhizome, which indicate that it is shoot\ntissue, not root tissue. Also note that the\nroots emerging from these nodes. The\nroots are adventitious because they\nemerge from shoot tissue rather than\nRhizome of Echinopogon ovatus. The roots emerging from\nfrom the primary root (which disintegrates nodes indicate the rhizome is stem tissue.\nearly in the growth of grasses). Shoot\ntissue often also emerges from these nodes.\nBoth tap root systems and fibrous root systems rely on root hairs to gather moisture and\nnutrients. Root hairs are extensions of the outer layer of cells (called the epidermis) of\nyoung roots. Root hairs live for only a few weeks, deteriorate, and are then replaced by\nfresh root hairs. 3.3 ROOTS | 107\nAreas of a root.

These plants typically have a vegetative phase early in their lifespan, followed by\na reproductive phase.\nDuring the vegetative phase, stem growth takes place through the addition of new cells \u2014\nincluding new nodes and internodes \u2014 by the apical meristem (the growing point or bud\nat the tip of the stem) and through elongation of those new cells. Leaves and branches\nthen emerge at the nodes.\nEventually, and typically at very specific and predictable times, hormonal signals within the\nplant that are triggered by external agents such as night length or sustained temperatures\nstimulate the formation of reproductive buds or meristems at nodes. These reproductive 118 | 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES\nmeristems give rise to inflorescences.

This\ndeterminate growth is beneficial in ornamental plants because it places flowers at the\nends of the stems and branches, where they are clearly displayed and showy. Next time 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES | 119\nyou walk past a bed of flowering plants, look at where the flowers are held on the plant. In\nmost cases, they will be at the tip of the stems and branches and positioned on the outer\nperiphery of the plant.\nGrasses are determinate. Leonora (Ellie) Enking, CC BY-SA 2.0\nDeterminate plants are also popular in agriculture because the plant produces all or most\nof its flowers at about the same time. The fruits ripen synchronously and can be harvested\nduring a narrow window of time rather than ripening at various times during the season,\nwhich would stretch harvest out over many weeks. Corn is an obvious example, with 120 | 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES\nthe tassel at the top of the plant being a terminal male inflorescence and the corn\near a terminal female inflorescence. This type of growth pattern is called determinate\nbecause once the apical meristem of the plant transforms into a reproductive meristem,\nthe number of nodes on that stem has been determined and will not increase. The stem\nmay increase a bit in length through the elongation of the cells in the internodes, but no\nadditional nodes will be formed.\nIndeterminate growth\nIn other plants, the apical meristem remains a vegetative meristem that is capable of\nforming new nodes and internodes throughout the season. Once the hormonal signals\nare right, reproductive axillary meristems at the nodes below the apical meristem produce\ninflorescences. Even though the reproductive phase has begun, the plant can still grow\nnew nodes and internodes from the apical meristems on stem and branches. As the\nseason progresses and as new nodes are formed by the apical meristem, these nodes\nalso mature to support the formation of more reproductive meristems and the growth of\ninflorescences. 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES | 121\nMany tomato plants are indeterminate. square foot hydroponics, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\nThis type of growth is called indeterminate since the number of nodes on the stem and\nbranches is not determined, and more can be added throughout the year.

For food plants, it means that fruits ripen at different times and so\nare available for a longer period of time through the year (many tomato cultivars are\nindeterminate). This may not be favored in large agricultural operations where the\npreference is for the efficiency of one simultaneous and large harvest, but it is great for\ngardeners who like small amounts of their produce to ripen throughout the season.\nWatch this video to see examples of determinate and indeterminate plants (2:48)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Some inflorescences are very\nsimple and support only one flower. These are called solitary or sole flower\ninflorescences, and the stalk attaching the flower to the node from which it grew is called\nthe peduncle. 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES | 123\nSalvia farinacea (Blue Sage). guzhengman. CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nOther inflorescences can support multiple flowers and display complex branching\npatterns.\nThe drawing to the right depicts a hypothetical inflorescence that supports multiple\nflowers. Toward the bottom are the last two nodes of the stem. The next-to-last node\nsupports a leaf, and the terminal node supports an inflorescence and a leaf. Since that leaf\nis associated with the inflorescence, rather than emerging from a stem node, botanists\ncall it a \u201cbract,\u201d even though it may look like a smaller version of the plant\u2019s other leaves.\nSince the terminal node transforms to be reproductive, this plant must have determinate\ngrowth. 124 | 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES\nThe stem-like part of the inflorescence between\nthe point where it emerges from the terminal\nnode of the stem and the point where the\nbranches of the inflorescence begin is called the\npeduncle. The central axis of the inflorescence,\nstarting at the point where the first\ninflorescence branch is attached, is called the\nrachis. The rachis may subdivide one or more\ntimes, and these subdivisions are considered\npart of the rachis. Finally, there is a short stalk\nconnecting the flower to the rachis; this is called\nthe pedicel.\nThis type of inflorescence, with peduncle,\npedicel, and single-flower structure, is called a\nInflorescence with labels. Image credit: Tom Michaels\nsimple inflorescence. An inflorescence with a\ngroup of flowers is called a compound inflorescence. A type of compound inflorescence\nwith multiple flowers originating from a common point is an umbel. The illustration below\nshows a simple umbel compared to a compound umbel. On the left, in the simple umbel,\nthe pedicels radiate out from a central point at the end of the peduncle and attach to a\nsingle flower. On the right, in the compound umbel, rachi radiate out from the end of the\npeduncle, and an umbel is attached to the end of the rachis. 4.1 GROWTH PATTERNS AND INFLORESCENCES | 125\nSimple and compound umbels.

For any cell to respond to a hormone it\nmust be competent to perceive the chemical. Some cells simply lack the ability to \u201csee\u201d\nthe hormone and do not respond to its presence. Competency to perceive a hormone\ndepends on a cell\u2019s physiology when the hormone is present. If the hormone is perceived,\nits unique chemical structure causes a chain reaction or signal transduction that involves\nchanges in gene expression and cell morphology. These cellular responses to hormones\ncan lead to changes we see in the plant, such as movement towards light, a transition from\nvegetative growth to flowering, or the closing of leaf stomata due to drought stress.\nThe perception of the hormone occurs in cells and throughout a tissue or organ,\ndepending on where the hormone is located, the concentration of the hormone, and the\ndevelopmental state and physiological condition of the cell. Many cells within a tissue can 128 | 4.2 PLANT HORMONES\nrespond in a coordinated manner, resulting in changes in the whole plant. Hormones are\noften made in one cell and translocated to other cells where they are perceived, and the\nresponse may occur far away from the site of hormone synthesis. Responses to hormones\nare studied through exogenous application of the chemical to a plant tissue \u2014 the\nhormone is applied to the outside (exo) of the plant and observations are made on how\nthe plant responds. For hormones that are a gas, like ethylene, this means the hormone\ncan be translocated from one plant to another plant. The plants are essentially talking to\none another, using a wide variety of molecules.\nExperiments in which hormones are exogenously applied to a plant reveal how plants\nrespond to hormones; much of our knowledge about the role hormones play in plant\ngrowth is from this type of experiment. Whenever a hormone is exogenously applied,\nhowever, it is also interacting with all of the hormones present in the plant. These are\nendogenous hormones (endo means internal), and the cell responds according to the\nsum of all hormones in its presence. This can complicate the interpretation of responses\nto exogenous hormone applications.\nThe hormones used in plant propagation can be naturally occurring and found in many\nplants, or can be synthetic or synthesized to mimic the structure and response of a\nnaturally occurring hormone. Synthetic hormones are often used instead of naturally\noccurring versions because they are less expensive to obtain, may cause greater or longer\nlasting responses, and can be less susceptible to degradation in the plant and during\nstorage. Because exogenous application of hormones play a role in manipulating or\ndisrupting plant growth, they are used extensively as herbicides (weed killers) and can be\ntargeted to certain types of plants based on how certain species respond to the different\nstructure.\nPlant responses to hormones and their application in\nplant propagation\nAuxin\nAuxins are a group of related molecules that are involved in almost every aspect of the\nplant\u2019s life cycle. Auxins stimulate growth through cell elongation, which is integral to\nthe plant\u2019s responses to environmental changes. Auxins are responsible for two types\nof growth responses: phototropism, the bending or growth of a shoot toward light,\nand gravitropism, a change in growth occurring after a change in gravitational force. 4.2 PLANT HORMONES | 129\nThe diagram below shows indoleacetic acid (IAA, illustrated with pink dots), a naturally\noccurring auxin, moving from the sunny to the shady side of a shoot tip. The differential\naccumulation of auxin on the shady side of the shoot causes those cells to increase\ngrowth and bends the shoot tip toward the light. Auxin\u2019s stimulation of cell growth is also\nimportant in healing wounds and forming calluses after pruning.\n1. This is a normal plant that has the sun positioned almost directly over the plant. During this time, the auxin (pink dots) that lies\nwithin the plant is evenly distributed. 2. The sun is now positioned at an angle to the plant. The repositioning of the sun causes the\nauxin to move the other side of the plant, and becomes more concentrated. This overload of auxin next to these cells causes them to\nstart to grow or elongate. 3. This results in the the plant to look like it is growing toward the sun. 4. If the sun moves to the other\nside of the plant, the auxin would again move to the other side of the plant and become concentrated on the side of the plant that is\nfarthest away from the sun. 5. The same growth or elongation of the cells on this side of plant would continue to grow towards the\nsun. Image by MacKhayman. CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe ability of auxin to regulate growth can be turned against weeds (plants out of place).\nThe synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, or 2,4-D, is a common herbicide that\ninterrupts normal growth regulation when applied to the plant, causing leaf drop and\ndeath. Because dicotyledonous (dicot) plants have a higher competency to respond to\n2,4-D, 2,4-D can be used as a selective herbicide to kill dicot weeds in lawns and corn fields,\nwhich are resistant, monocotyledonous (monocot) grasses. The grass is unharmed due to\nits lower competency to respond, while the dicot plants are killed.\nIn general, auxins are produced in the young leaves of a plant and translocated downward 130 | 4.2 PLANT HORMONES\nto older tissues. This downward translocation controls apical dominance, where growth\nof axillary buds is suppressed. Removal (pinching) of the shoot tip where auxin is being\nproduced, as shown in the three photos of mint below, releases the axillary buds from\napical dominance and they begin to grow. This is a common horticultural practice,\nincreasing branching and flower production. Pinching is often used in seedling plants such\nas basil or zinnias to get globe forms in a pot instead of tall, single-stemmed plants.\nOne of the most important uses of auxin in plant propagation is to stimulate the growth\nof adventitious roots \u2014 roots that emerge from anywhere on the plant other than from\nthe roots \u2014 on shoot cuttings. The photo below shows cuttings from two different Acer\nginnala (Amur maple) plants that have different competencies to form adventitious roots.\nBoth cuttings were treated with auxin, but only the competent plant forms adventitious\nroots (on the left). The cutting from a plant that lacks competency to respond to auxin did\nnot form roots (right) and will eventually die. 4.2 PLANT HORMONES | 131\nImage by Matthew Clark\nThis form of asexual (clonal) propagation is used by both horticultural professionals\nand hobbyists. The competency for rooting cuttings can be species specific or seasonal.\nCollecting stems from a plant to use for cuttings can be more successful in the growing\nseason, as with the Amur maples shown above. With plants such as grapes, however,\ncuttings are made and rooted during the winter when the vines are not actively growing.\nThe video below demonstrates how shoot cuttings are taken from Amur maples, treated\nwith auxin, and incubated in a high-humidity environment for several weeks to form\nadventitious roots. Exogenous application of auxin is not required for adventitious rooting\nof all plants. Some plants can form many adventitious roots without exogenous\napplications, because the endogenous auxin that occurs naturally in the shoot is sufficient\nfor root formation. 132 | 4.2 PLANT HORMONES\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

However, the plant\u2019s response to cytokinin is very different from the\nresponses to auxin. Cytokinin comes from the word cytokinesis, which means cell division.\nYou will learn about cytokinesis, specifically mitosis, in Chapter 13.\nCytokinins promote cell division, where one cell splits and two new daughter cells are\nformed. Cytokinins are important regulators of plant growth and development.\nCytokinins have an interesting interaction with auxin in plants. In the 1950s, Skoog and\nMiller were researching the growth of N. tabacum stems in tissue culture. They discovered\nthat they could use specific ratios of an auxin (IAA) and a cytokinin (kinetin) to direct the\ngrowth of the stem tissue in culture. A high ratio of cytokinin relative to auxin led to\nshoot formation, a higher level of auxin led to root formation, and equal levels of each\nproduced callus growth, which is undifferentiated plant cell growth. Skoog and Miller\u2019s\ntransformational discovery formed the basis of the \u201cMS\u201d plant medium that remains\npopular for plant propagation using tissue culture.\nWatch this video to learn more about the propagation of plants in synthetic media with\nexogenous hormones in tissue culture.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

They were discovered during\nresearch on the cause of the \u201cfoolish seedling\u201d disease of rice. The disease, characterized 4.2 PLANT HORMONES | 133\nby tall plants with little grain, is caused by an infection with Gibberella fujikora, a parasitic\nfungus that produces GA in the rice shoots, causing increased stem elongation.\nIn Chapter 9.2, on seed physiology, you will learn that some seeds are dormant and do\nnot germinate even when the proper environment is provided. Seed dormancy, which\nhas several causes and evolutionary advantages, always has the common feature of\npreventing seed germination until the time, season, or seed physiology is correct. Planting\na dormant seed or a dead seed gives the same result: no germination. For plant\npropagators, dormancy can be confusing, raising the question \u201care my seeds dead or are\nthey dormant?\u201d Either condition prevents germination and plant propagation. Treating\nseeds with GA is a common method to break dormancy and facilitate germination. GA\ntreatment of Gentiana lutea (bitter root) seeds, for example, increases germination from\n0% (no germination) to over 80% when treated with 100 parts per million (ppm) GA (see\nthe graph of germination on the left). If a propagator of G. lutea had not known about seed\ndormancy, they may have assumed their bitter root seeds were dead. For most plants, GA\nis the endogenous hormone that triggers seed germination.\nAbscisic acid\nWhile GA facilitates seed germination, abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits it. Abscisic acid is a\nsingle molecule that regulates germination and the response of a plant to reduced water\navailability during drought stress. ABA levels increase as water becomes less available to 134 | 4.2 PLANT HORMONES\nthe plant, evoking several responses, including the closing of stomates. Closing stomata\nslows transpiration (also called evapotranspiration), the movement of water in the plant\nfrom the root to stem to leaf and out through the stomata into the atmosphere. You\u2019ll\nread more about stomata and the movement of water in Chapter 11, Plants and water.\nReducing water content is one of the final steps in seed maturation and is important for\nseed longevity by reducing metabolism to a minimum, which is the quiescent nature of\nmature seeds. Increasing endogenous ABA levels in seeds prepares them to survive lower\nwater content, is important to seed maturation, and prevents precocious germination\n(vivipary). Seeds with low levels of ABA during seed development may prematurely\ngerminate. Low ABA levels may result from a genetic mutation or environmental causes.\nVivipary in some fruits is not uncommon and may occur during storage of fruit in the\ngrocery store. 4.2 PLANT HORMONES | 135\nApple in vivipary. Image by Matthew Clark.\nEthylene\nEthylene is well known as the gaseous, ripening hormone. It also regulates seedling\ngrowth and the formation of root hairs, and can lead to epinasty \u2014 the bending of\nbranches downwards. 136 | 4.2 PLANT HORMONES\nMany plants are sensitive to the effect ethylene has on fruit ripening. The iconic examples\nare tomato and banana. These fruits are climacteric \u2014 they continue to ripen after\nharvest. The perception of ethylene by the cells that make up the fruit triggers the ripening\nprocess and the production of more ethylene. As the concentration of ethylene increases,\nso does the speed of the ripening. Picking immature or green fruit enables shipment\nover long distances, because the fruit is firmer and less likely to be damaged in transit.\nThe green fruit can then be treated with ethylene from an ethylene generator (right) to\naccelerate ripening.\nSeven ripening stages of banana.\nFor other fruit crops, the introduction or production of ethylene is to be avoided to\nprevent over-ripening and spoilage. To prevent the generation of ethylene during fruit\nstorage, ethylene is scrubbed from the air using an air filter system. Reducing the ethylene\nconcentration means slower ripening and less spoilage.\nThe process of senescence is also triggered by ethylene production and is important in the\ncut flower industry. Keeping cut flowers away from gases with ethylene-like activity helps\nkeep floral arrangements looking fresh. Reducing ethylene action prolongs the vase life of\nmany cut flowers as well as the storage of fruits.\nReview\nThe five major groups of plant hormones control many aspects of plant growth and\ndevelopment and have important applications in plant propagation. However, many other\nmolecules are also key to the plant\u2019s response to its environment. These highly diverse 4.2 PLANT HORMONES | 137\nsignal molecules modulate the plant\u2019s physiology through complex interactions.

In late\nsummer and fall, the mesophyll cell chloroplasts produce chlorophyll at a slower rate than\nearlier in the year. As the existing chlorophyll reaches the end of its functional lifespan\nand eventually degenerates, the amount of chlorophyll declines over time. Because\nchlorophyll replacement doesn\u2019t make up for chlorophyll loss, the green color fades from\nthe leaves. Meanwhile, the non-green pigments in the chromoplasts hold their own or\nincrease in quantity, including the yellow and orange from the carotenoid pigments and\nthe red from the anthocyanin pigments.\nCarotenoid pigments are present in the leaf all growing season, but during the warm\npart of the season they\u2019re hidden by the high concentration of green-colored chlorophyll.\nWhen the cool autumn weather comes, the days shorten and the chlorophyll\nconcentration in the chloroplasts declines. The carotenoids in the chromoplasts don\u2019t\ndegenerate as quickly as the chlorophyll does, so we get a beautiful display of oranges\nand yellows in the leaves once the green is gone. These orange and yellow colors can be\ncounted on every year because the carotenoids are produced and present all year long.\nIn contrast to the carotenoid pigments, the amount of red color in leaves from the\nanthocyanins differs from autumn to autumn. Anthocyanins are produced primarily in the\nautumn in response to bright light and excess plant sugars in leaf cells. Warm, sunny days\nencourage sugar production in leaf mesophyll, and cool nights hinder the transport of\nthese sugars out of the cells, so the sugars stay in leaves. The high sugar then stimulates\nanthocyanin production. Warm, bright days + cool nights = red leaves. In years with\novercast days and warmer nights, there is less sugar production in the leaves and the\nsugars translocate (move out) from the leaf mesophyll cells to other locations in the tree,\nso there is less anthocyanin pigment produced and less red color in the leaves. You might\nsee this happening on individual trees: on the sunlit, southwest side of the tree you might\nfind leaves with more red than on the shaded, northeast side. This effect of weather on\nanthocyanin is particularly noticeable in trees such as sugar maples.\nSome other woody plants, like sumac, seem to be bright red in later September and early\nOctober regardless of the weather conditions. Other trees, like birch and oak, will be\nyellow or tan even with warm bright days and cool nights.\nHere is a cross section of a pear leaf showing the same cells illustrated in the graphic\nshown earlier. 5.1 INSIDE LEAVES | 149\nMicrograph cross section of leaf. Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library. Public domain\nThe palisade mesophyll is highly adapted for capturing light energy. As noted earlier, the\ncells are packed tightly together, filled with chloroplasts, and make up the cell layer just\nunder the protective epidermis on the top surface of the leaf oriented toward the sun. The\nspongy mesophyll cells below the palisade layer are less densely packed together, so the\nregion is laced with air channels. This makes the spongy mesophyll highly adapted for gas\nmovement and air exchange around the cells. 150 | 5.1 INSIDE LEAVES\nThe circles show the guard cells around the stomata on the lower surface of the leaf. bccoer. CC0.\nGuard cells surround a gap in the epidermis. This gap is called a stoma or stomate (plural\n= stomata), and is the portal through which gas exchanges between the interior and\nexterior of the leaf. Gases in the intercellular spaces between spongy mesophyll cells are\nfree to move out of the stomata into the atmosphere, and atmospheric gasses are free to\nmove in. As we will see later when we address photosynthesis, healthy plants must have\nthe ability to move oxygen (a waste product of photosynthesis) out of the leaf, and carbon\ndioxide (a raw material for building sugars) into the leaf. Water vapor must also be able to\nmove out of the leaf as part of the transpiration process.\nThe vascular bundle (the xylem and phloem in the graphic above) is highly adapted for\ntransport of fluids. Water and dissolved minerals move up the xylem from the roots and\ninto the leaf. Sugars produced in the leaf during photosynthesis move out of the leaf\nthrough the phloem and are translocated to other parts of the plant. The thick-walled\nbundle sheath cells that surround the xylem and phloem provide mechanical support, and\ncontribute to some types of photosynthesis.

Herbaceous plant shoots grow\nin length and diameter in the same way that roots\ndo: the apical meristem at the tip of the stem\nproduces new cells and then those new cells\nenlarge in length and volume in the region of\nelongation just behind the meristem. Stems of\nherbaceous plants typically do not thicken very\nmuch and rely instead on branching to grow\nlaterally (although there are exceptions like\nsunflower and tomato whose stems do thicken\nnoticeably). Branching of the shoot is initiated at\nnodes where there are axillary buds containing\naxillary meristems that grow into branches.\nContinued growth of the stem in diameter, like you\nfind in a tree where the trunk and branches\nincrease in diameter each year, requires an active\nNotice this image of a palm tree because it will\nlateral meristem called the cambium. Cambium is\ncome up again later. Think about where and how\nit is growing. Travel Aficionado \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0\na meristem in the vascular tissue positioned\nbetween the xylem and phloem that continues to\nproduce new xylem cells toward the interior of the stem and new phloem cells toward the\nexterior. Production of xylem and phloem from cambium cells is called secondary\ngrowth and is typical of woody perennial plants. We will explore plants with secondary\ngrowth in a different lesson.\nSome herbaceous plants are annuals, like beans and pansies, where the whole plant dies\nover the winter. These plants complete their life cycle from seed to flower to seed in\none year. Other herbaceous plants, like Kentucky bluegrass and chrysanthemums, are\nherbaceous perennials where only the above-ground growth dies over winter (unless\nit is a really nasty winter). The root, or in some cases underground stem tissue, stores\nnutrients for the next season\u2019s growth. In spring when soil and air temperatures are\nsufficiently warm, new shoots emerge from nodes on compact stem tissues often called\ncrowns. The cells in the crown tissue survive the harsh winter temperatures because they 154 | 5.2 INSIDE STEMS\naccumulate sugars and other compounds that act as antifreeze compounds. They are\nlocated very close to the soil surface, or even protected a bit by the soil. This position on\nor in the soil, plus snow cover, results in much warmer temperatures around the crown\nthan the air temperature above the snow. In fact, the air temperature can be -20\u00b0F above\nthe snow and only a few degrees below freezing (32\u00b0F) around the crown.\nDicotyledonous stems\nWatch this video for a detailed description of dicot stems (2:19).\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Notice how the vascular bundles\nof dicots are arranged in a ring around the circumference of the plant stem with the cortex\nto the outside and pith to the inside. 5.2 INSIDE STEMS | 155\nDicot stem. Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library. Public domain\nEpidermis \u2013 This tough covering is a single layer of living cells. These cells are closely\npacked and function to protect the internal parts of the plant. The walls are thickened\nand covered with a thin waxy waterproof layer called the cuticle that reduces water loss\nfrom the plant. Stomata with guard cells are found in the epidermis, and these function\nto allow gasses into and out of the stem, similar to their function in leaves. In some stems\neither unicellular or multicellular hair-like outgrowths, called trichomes, appear from the\nepidermis. Below is an image of trichomes on a tomato stem, inflorescence, and leaf. 156 | 5.2 INSIDE STEMS\nTomato stems, leaves, and inflorescences have abundant trichomes. Quinn Dombrowski \u2013 CC BY-SA\nCortex \u2013 Also known as the ground meristem, the cortex is found just inside the epidermis\nand extends toward the interior of the stem. It is made up of three types of cells:\nparenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma.\nVascular bundles \u2013 This region contains sclerenchyma fibers that strengthen the stem\nand provide protection for the vascular bundle. In dicots, the vascular bundles form a\ndistinct ring. A mature vascular bundle consists of three main tissues \u2013 xylem, phloem,\nand cambium. The phloem is always located toward the outside of the bundle and the\nxylem always toward the center. The cambium separates the xylem and phloem, and, in\nthose plants where secondary growth takes place, the cambium produces new xylem and\nphloem cells: xylem toward the center, phloem toward the outside.\nThe pith occupies the central part of the stem and is composed of thin-walled\nparenchyma cells often with larger intercellular spaces than you would find in the cortex. 5.2 INSIDE STEMS | 157\nCross section of a young sunflower (Helianthus) stem, magnified 100x. Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library.\nPublic domain\nIn this cross section of a dicot stem note the collenchyma cells in the cortex just under the\nepidermis. Sunflower stems are quite tough, and this toughness is in part due to the layer\nof collenchyma cells positioned to give the stem mechanical stability. Toward the outside\nof each vascular bundle are fibers of sclerenchyma that also contribute to the sunflower\nstem\u2019s toughness. Then, moving from the outside to the inside, you will find phloem, a\nlayer of cambium, and then xylem. The pith is in the center.\nNow you might recall that just above we said that herbaceous annuals like sunflower\ndon\u2019t have cambium to increase the girth of the stem, so what\u2019s with the cambium in this\npicture of a sunflower stem? Well, you will see a layer of cambium between the xylem\nand phloem of dicot stems, and it is active for a while and produces a modest amount of\nxylem and phloem which contributes to the sunflower\u2019s larger diameter stem. However,\nthis cambium tissue is not continuously active as in woody stems, and the plant does not\nsurvive through the winter. 158 | 5.2 INSIDE STEMS\nMonocotyledonous stems\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

In monocots,\nvascular bundles are scattered throughout the stem instead of being oriented in a ring.\nSince there is no ring of vascular bundles, there is no \u201cinside\u201d pith and \u201coutside\u201d cortex. All\nthe ground tissue is considered to be cortex. 5.2 INSIDE STEMS | 159\nMonocot corn stem cross section showing vascular bundles. Melissa Ha. CC BY-NC 2.0\nIn monocot vascular bundles the phloem is always oriented toward the outside of the\nplant and the xylem toward the inside. There is no cambium and no secondary growth.\nAround the outside of the vascular bundle is a layer of parenchyma cells called the bundle\nsheath. This layer of cells is very important in photosynthesis. For now we will consider it\na protective covering and supportive sheath around the vascular bundle. 160 | 5.2 INSIDE STEMS\nMonocot stem showing vascular bundles. Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library. Public domain.\nOne final note\nSo why the palm tree? Because it is an exception.\nA palm tree is a monocot, but unlike other monocots whose stems are quite thin (like\ngrasses, for instance), their primary stems do increase in girth from year to year even\nthough they do not have secondary cambium. Palms have a special layer of meristematic\ncells, called the primary thickening meristem, oriented toward the outside of the stem\nthat each year can initiate new vascular bundles and new parenchyma cells. Each year\nthe stem expands in girth as a result of the palm\u2019s production of new parenchyma and\nvascular bundles.

A plant doesn\u2019t necessarily have only primary or\njust adventitious roots. One of these systems, however, will be dominant. Whether a root\nis considered primary or adventitious depends on whether the root traces back to the\nradicle (embryonic root) or arises from (normally underground) stem tissue.\nTap root (or primary root) system\nTap or primary roots arise as a continuation of the embryonic radicle tissue and persist\ninto maturity. Secondary roots (also called lateral roots) arise from the primary root,\nand tertiary roots arise from the secondary. This primary \u2013> secondary \u2013> tertiary root\nformation is the usual rooting system for dicots. Next time you see a dandelion or other\nweed that doesn\u2019t look like a grass, yank it up and look at the root system. The main root\nyou see (assuming that it didn\u2019t break off when you pulled it up) is probably a tap root.\nThe photo on the right, above, demonstrates this point. It shows a young taproot system\nwith many secondary roots branching off the primary root. 5.3 INSIDE ROOTS | 165\nThis Desmanthus spp. plant has a strong central taproot with many lateral or secondary roots. Btcpg \u2013 CC BY-SA 4.0\nAdventitious or fibrous root system\nIn plants of this type, the primary root, which originates from the radicle, weakens prior\nto maturity and new, vigorous, adventitious roots arise from stem tissue. Adventitious\nroots may grow from nodes or might arise from the internodes. They originate from\nparenchyma cells in the cortex of the stem. Dig up a clump of turfgrass and look at the\nroots. Turfgrass has a fibrous root system, as does corn. 166 | 5.3 INSIDE ROOTS\nAdventitious corn roots. NY State IPM Program at Cornell University.

CC BY 4.0 International\nRoot cap\nShaped like a thimble, this structure covers the tip of the root and provides protection as\nthe root grows into the soil. These parenchyma cells are produced by the root\u2019s meristem\nwhich is just behind the root cap. The outer cells of the root cap are continuously worn\naway through contact with the soil, and new cells are added to the inner portion.\nIn addition to protecting the interior of the root, the cap secretes a mucilage which\nstabilizes the water content of the surrounding soil, ensuring longer-lasting nutrition\nto the root system and making for easier root probing. Finally, the root cap contains\nstatocytes, specialized cells that help the plant sense gravity and grow accordingly. These\ncells are full of starchy organelles which settle at the lowest part of the cell and encourage 5.3 INSIDE ROOTS | 169\ngrowth in that direction. If the root cap, with these statocytes, is removed, a plant may\ngrow in random directions because it has lost the ability for gravitropism (growth in\nresponse to gravity).\nRoot meristem\nThe cells here divide rapidly via mitosis to form new cells. New cells are laid down toward\nthe root cap to replace those worn away during root growth, and also laid down away\nfrom the root cap. These new cells laid away from the root cap elongate and then mature\ninto more specialized root tissues.\nRegion or zone of elongation\nIn this region, the cells produced by the root meristem undergo rapid elongation \u2014\nthey expand in length and volume. Root growth is the result of two processes: new cell\nproduction by the root meristem, and subsequent elongation of those new cells. This\ngrowth pushes the root further into the soil and also expands the diameter of the root.\nWithin the region of elongation just behind the meristem you will find the following\nundifferentiated tissues:\n\u2022 Protoderm \u2014 new cells laid down toward the exterior of the root which will mature\nto become the root dermal tissue (primarily epidermis cells).\n\u2022 Procambium \u2014 new cells in the central part of the root which will mature to\nbecome the vascular tissue (xylem, phloem, and vascular cambium), labeled in the\nillustration above this section as the vascular cylinder.\n\u2022 Ground meristem \u2014 the new cells lying between the protoderm and procambium\nthat will mature to become the cortex tissue (primarily parenchyma cells).\nRegion of differentiation (also called the region of\nmaturation)\nHere the root becomes thicker, and secondary or lateral roots are initiated. In this region\nthe protoderm, procambium, and ground meristem cells undergo differentiation into the\nspecialized cells associated with the dermal, vascular, and cortex tissues, as noted above. 170 | 5.3 INSIDE ROOTS\nRoot-hairs begin to form in the region of differentiation; these are fine outgrowths of\nepidermis cell walls and membranes, and increase the area of absorption of the root.\nHere is a magnified image of a root, and a drawing to point out the various components.

Are they always\nfound emerging from nodes or from internodes, or does it depend on the type of plant?\nDicot roots vs. monocot roots\nLet\u2019s take a look at the root another way. If\nwe were to cut a cross section of the root\njust above the root hairs in the zone of\ndifferentiation, you would find that the\ncells have differentiated to form the\nfollowing tissues:\nEpidermis \u2013 a one-cell thick layer of cells\nsurrounding the root. These cells do not\nhave the cutin or waxy covering that you\nwill find in stem epidermis cells because\nroots don\u2019t need to keep moisture inside\nthe root. Quite the opposite, the roots\nneed to be permeable to moisture. Root\nhairs arise from the epidermal cells.\nCortex \u2013 The cells inside the epidermis\nmake up the cortex. Cortex cells in the root\nusually consist of parenchyma cells with\nnumerous intercellular spaces through\nwhich water can move. However, the\ninnermost cells of the cortex, called the\nInternal root structure of monocot and dicot roots.\nendodermis, are rectangular in shape with\nthicker walls, are stacked close together, and have a band-like deposit of waterproof\nsuberin that wraps around each cell like caulk in the intercellular spaces. This thick band\nof suberin is called the Casparian strip and it closes up the intercellular space between 172 | 5.3 INSIDE ROOTS\ncells. The Casparian strip forms a barrier to the water that has been moving freely through\nintercellular spaces and forces the water to instead move internally through a layer of\ncells before it gets into the xylem. That way, the cells can exert some regulation on water\npassage into the root vascular system.\nLet\u2019s talk a bit more about water movement in roots. Some water moves from soil to root\nthrough the root hairs, which you will recall are extensions of the root epidermis cells.\nBecause the water is moving into a cell, the water must pass through the cell membrane,\nwhich is a semipermeable membrane that exerts some control over what comes into\nand goes out of the cell. The water then moves from cell to cell through the cortex to\nthe vascular bundle. Because it is moving within cortex cells it is not constrained by the\nCasparian strip because the Casparian strip is a band around the outside of the innermost\nlayer of cortex cells. This type of water movement through the cortex is called symplastic\nmovement. Symplastic means from cell to cell.\nA second type of water movement through the cortex is called apoplastic movement.\nApoplastic water movement occurs outside of the cells. Water squeezes between the\ncortex cells until it reaches the Casparian strip, and then if it wants to go any further into\nthe plant it must move into the cortex cells through the cell membrane. Once in the cortex\ncells, it continues to the vascular bundle through symplastic movement. We\u2019ll get more\ninto this later when we look closer at water and plants.\nSummary of cortex function:\n\u2022 Allows for the diffusion of water, minerals, and oxygen from the root hairs inwards.\n\u2022 Stores food reserves, especially starch.\n\u2022 The endodermis, with the aid of the Casparian strips, facilitates the regulated\napoplastic movement of water from cortex to xylem.\nWhen talking about stem cortex tissue, we noted it was made up of three cell types:\nparenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma. Just above we said root tissue cortex is\nmade up of parenchyma cells. What about the other two cell types? The roots aren\u2019t in\nneed of stiffening the way that an upright above ground stem needs in order to resist\ngravity and wind, so they don\u2019t need the cell types (collenchyma and sclerenchyma) that\nprovide that stiffening in the stem cortex. 5.3 INSIDE ROOTS | 173\nVascular Cylinder or Stele \u2013 The vascular cylinder begins\njust inside the endodermis.\nThe first set of cells you encounter as you move into the vascular cylinder is a single layer\nof tightly packed cells called the pericycle. The pericycle cells retain the ability to divide and\nproduce new cells. This layer of cells is the source of lateral roots. The image to the right\nshows an example of lateral root initiation from the pericycle. You may recall that earlier\nI mentioned that adventitious roots in fibrous root systems arise from cortex tissue. Here\nI\u2019m talking about a tap root system where the laterals arise from the pericycle cells in the\nvascular tissue.\nThe root vascular cylinder also contains xylem and phloem. In roots of dicotyledonous\nplants (plants whose seeds have two cotyledons) the xylem is in the center of the root,\ntypically in the form of a thick-armed \u201cX\u201d, with phloem in the spaces between the arms.\nNot all dicots have the xylem in an obvious X shape\u2026in some cases it looks a bit more\nround than a distinct X (as with the carrot taproot).\nDicot roots\nWatch this video for a detailed description of dicot roots (5:19)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Chloroplasts are not evenly distributed throughout the\nplant but, as you might expect, are concentrated in parts of the plant that are exposed\nto and oriented toward the sun. A plant cell in the leaf blade will have many chloroplasts,\nwhile cells in the middle of the stem will have few or none.\nMitochondria\n(Singular = mitochondrion)\nThe mitochondria is where stored sugars from photosynthesis are metabolized to\nproduce forms of energy that the plant can use for growth.

The cells within a tissue may differ from\none another, but they all contribute to a particular function. We\u2019re going to look at three\ntypes of tissues: dermal, cortex, and vascular.\nDermal tissue\nDermal tissues (derma is Greek for \u201cskin\u201d) are on the outside of the plant and provide\nprotection for the plant cells they surround. The cells making up dermal tissues are tough\nso that they can protect against mechanical challenges to the plant, like abrasion. They\nhave thick cell walls. In the shoot, the epidermis cells, which are the main cell type in\ndermal tissue, secrete a water-resistant substance called cutin (a waxy polymer), which\ncoats the wall of the cell exposed to the environment. This coating helps limit the loss to\nthe atmosphere of water that is inside the plant. Cutin is absent or greatly reduced in root\ntissue because roots need to reach out into the soil to absorb water and nutrients. 186 | 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES\nA cluster of mite eggs just beneath the epidermis of a leaf.

BlueRidgeKitties, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nThe epidermis is the outermost layer of cells in the plant. It is normally only one cell thick,\nbut in some cases the epidermis can be a few cells thick. Epidermis cells typically have few\nif any chloroplasts. They are often called pavement cells because they are flat like tiles\nor puzzle pieces. Depending on the plant, the epidermis may have hairs, or trichomes,\nthat extend out from the plant. Some of these trichomes are associated with glands that\ncontain oils or other substances secreted by the plant. 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES | 189\nNotice that the root hairs are an extension of the epidermal root cell. Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library. Public\ndomain\nThe epidermis contains pairs of guard cells that will open to form stomata (Greek stoma\n= mouth; an opening in the leaf surface) through which gasses can move into and out\nof the deeper cell layers in the leaf. These guard cells are found most abundantly on the\nunderside of leaves, but may also be on the upper leaf surface and on the stems.\nThe root has dermal tissue as well. The predominant cell type, like in the shoot, is also\nepidermis, but as noted above there is no cutin covering the root epidermis because\nthe root is underground and less prone to dehydration. There are no guard cells or\ntrichomes, but there are root hairs . The root hair is a very small-diameter extension of the\nepidermis cell wall and cell membrane that extends out into the growth medium. Water\nand nutrients enter the plant through absorption into the root hairs.\nReview questions 190 | 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES\n1. What unique feature of the epidermis is found in roots and not shoots?\n2. What is the function of the waxy cutin layer? Why don\u2019t you find it on the root epidermis?\n3. Are stomata found in roots, shoots, or both? Why does this make sense?\n4. What\u2019s the difference between a cell and a tissue?\nCortex or ground meristem tissue\nThe cortex (sometimes called \u201cground meristem\u201c) tissue is found just inside the\nepidermis and extends toward the interior of the stem and root. Some types of plants\nalso contain cortex tissue at the very center of the stem called the pith, but you won\u2019t find\npith in roots or in all plant stems. Cortex cells provide structural support for the stems. In\nleaves, this tissue just inside the epidermis is called the mesophyll (\u201cmiddle of the leaf\u201d).\nMesophyll tissue is the site of most photosynthesis reactions in the leaf.\nThree types of cells make up the cortex:\nParenchyma\n\u2022 The most common type of cortex cell.\n\u2022 Has thin cell walls (called a primary wall in the graphic below).\n\u2022 The mature cell is alive.\n\u2022 Has the ability to begin dividing to help heal wounds (by covering the wound with\nplant tissue called callus).\n\u2022 Will also divide to initiate adventitious roots on stem cuttings.\n\u2022 Site of many other functions, such as photosynthesis and storage of starch and other\nchemical compounds.\n\u2022 Leaf mesophyll tissue is a type of parenchyma that is packed with chloroplasts.\nCollenchyma\n\u2022 A living cell at maturity.\n\u2022 Cell walls are thicker than the thin parenchyma cell walls, which give collenchyma 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES | 191\nstrength. However, these cells remain somewhat flexible compared to\nsclerenchyma, which you will read about next.\n\u2022 The cells can connect together to form resilient strands, like the strands of a celery\nstalk. These strands provide support for young tissues.\n\u2022 Because the cells are alive, they can respond to external stimuli. If the plant is\nregularly shaken by wind, for example, the collenchyma cells will respond by\nproducing thicker cell walls for greater support of the plant stem so that it can\nremain upright.\nTypes of plant tissue. Licensed from Shutterstock. 192 | 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES\nSclerenchyma\n\u2022 This type of cell has a primary and secondary cell wall. The primary cell wall, on the\noutside of the cell, is rich in cellulose, just like other plant cell walls. Once the cell has\nreached its final size, a secondary cell wall is deposited just inside the primary wall.\nThe secondary wall has a high concentration of lignin that gives the cell rigidity. This\nrigid, lignified secondary cell wall is responsible for sclerenchyma\u2019s hardness and\nstrengthening properties. Sclerenchyma comes in two types:\n\u25e6 Fibers (see below) formed from long strands of sclerenchyma. These tough\nfibers give the plant rigidity. We extract these fibers from plants and use them in\nfabrics, carpets, and rope. Examples of plant fibers made up of sclerenchyma\ncells include jute, hemp, and flax (the fabric made of flax fibers is called linen).\nCotton is not in this list; it is an epidermal fiber produced by the plant\u2019s seed\ncoats.\n\u25e6 Sclereids are cells with hard, tough cell walls. Sclereid cells can coalesce and\ncover other plant parts. For instance, they form the hard covering around the\nseeds (the endocarp) of stone fruits like cherries, the hard shell around walnuts,\nand the hard covering of coconut. Sclereids also make up the grit that crunches\nbetween your teeth when you eat a pear.\n\u2022 Sclerenchyma cells are dead at maturity. They don\u2019t thicken in response to external\nstimuli the way collenchyma can.\nReview questions\n1. Which cortex cells are alive and which are dead when mature?\n2. Which cells make up the tough fibers from which rope and fabrics can be made?\n3. Which cells divide to initiate adventitious roots?\n4. What tissue in the leaf corresponds to the cortex in the stem? 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES | 193\nVascular tissue\nVascular tissues form the plumbing system in the plant through which water, nutrients,\nsugars, and other compounds flow. These plumbing pipes and associated cells are\nbundled together in the plant in a structure called the vascular bundle. There are three\nmain types of vascular tissue: xylem, phloem, and vascular cambium. Xylem and phloem\nare composed of different types of cells, listed below.\nXylem\n\u2022 Moves water in the plant.\n\u2022 The water flow is unidirectional. Water in xylem heads from root to stem to leaf and\nthen out of the plant stomates through a process called transpiration.\n\u2022 The part of the tree that we call \u201cwood\u201d is made up of xylem.\n\u2022 These cells are dead at maturity, and they are hollow.\nXylem tissue is composed of four different types of cells:\nVessels\nElongated cells that connect end to end to form tubes. The cells are dead at maturity. The\nend walls of the vessels are perforated, so water can move freely through the holes and\nflow from cell to cell. Vessels have a relatively large diameter compared to other xylem\ncells and allow greater movement of water.\nTracheids\nThese cells are elongated and narrower than vessels, and connect by overlapping at\ntheir ends. These cells are also dead at maturity and contain pits through which water\ncan move. Tracheids appear earlier in the paleontological record of plant evolutionary\ndevelopment than vessels and are thus considered \u201cprimitive\u201d (not inferior, but appearing\nearlier in evolutionary time). Vessels are a subsequent evolutionary adaptation that allow\nfor greater water flow because of their larger diameter. 194 | 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES\nXylem fibers\nSclerenchyma cells lying near the vessels and tracheids, and thus part of the vascular\nbundle. They are strung together end to end like the vessels and tracheids, but unlike\nthose water carriers they have no pits or perforations and instead have thick primary and\nsecondary cell walls. They provide flexible support for the plant from within the vascular\nbundles.\nXylem parenchyma\nIn woody plants there are parenchyma\ncells around the vascular bundles that\nextend horizontally through the xylem (the\nwoody part of the plant) and develop into\nrays moving laterally from the center to\nthe exterior of the plant. Most of the\nvascular cell types are arranged in a linear\nfashion parallel to the long axis of the\nstem, but parenchyma rays are arranged\nlaterally from the middle of the stem out\ntoward the epidermis. They function to\nconduct water through the wood (xylem).\nOak furniture for example, it will have a\n\u201cgrain\u201d which is caused by the annual rings\nof xylem, and will have rays that, on edge,\nlook like small pits in the wood. We will see\nthis in later lectures when we deal more\nextensively with wood and secondary\ngrowth. As you can see in the photo to the\nright, some of the natural markings you\nsee in an instrument\u2019s wood are from\nparenchyma rays.\nBack of a ukulele that shows parenchyma rays.

The end walls\nhave pores. Unlike xylem cells, these cells are still alive. They have a thin cell membrane\ncontaining a layer of living protoplasm that hugs the wall of the cell.\nCNX OpenStax, CC BY 4.0 196 | 6.1 PLANT CELLS AND TISSUES\nCompanion cells\nAssociated with sieve tube members.

We will study secondary growth in Chapter 6.2.\nReview questions\n1. What substance flows in the xylem? Does it flow both directions or only up from the roots to\nthe leaves?\n2. What are examples of substances that flow in the phloem? Do these flow both directions or\nonly from roots to leaves?\n3. Which vascular cells are dead and which are alive at maturity?\n4.

CHAPTER 7: MERISTEMS AND FLOWERS | 205\nCHAPTER 7: MERISTEMS AND\nFLOWERS\nPlants have meristematic cells that are not differentiated, but that are destined to divide\nand produce other cells that may also divide, elongate, and differentiate into specialized\ncells and tissues. This process is called growth. A highly specialized structure produced\nafter the transition from a vegetative meristem to a reproductive meristem is called a\nflower. Floral organs are arranged in concentric circles or whorls and are the site of sexual\nreproduction.\nLearning objectives\n\u2022 Understand the meristems of primary and secondary growth and the specialized tissues they\nproduce.\n\u2022 Understand flower morphology and how sexual reproduction via pollination occurs. 206 | CHAPTER 7: MERISTEMS AND FLOWERS 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 207\n7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n\u2022 Differentiate between primary growth from apical meristems and secondary growth from\nlateral meristems.\n\u2022 Describe two types of lateral meristems and the types of tissues that are derived from these\nmeristems.\nPrimary growth from meristems\nYou\u2019ll recall that the apical meristem is the site of cell division and new cell production at\nthe tips of the plant stems and roots. The cells that make up the meristem are undergoing\nmitotic cell division to produce more cells. These new cells result in growth and\ndevelopment of plant tissues. (If you haven\u2019t previously studied mitosis, you\u2019ll have the\nopportunity to do so during this class.) For now it is sufficient to know that mitosis is the\nprocess of cell division where one plant cell divides into two identical cells. 208 | 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nMicroscope view of coleus shoot tip with labels. BlueRidgeKitties, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nAbove is a micrograph of a coleus shoot tip. You can see the dome of the apical meristem\nat the very tip of the shoot surrounded by leaf primordia (rudimentary leaves). On the far\nleft and far right are the cells of two growing leaves. You can see a trace of vascular tissue\non the left leaf near the \u201cL\u201d of the leaf label. There is another red stained area called the\naxillary bud, which we\u2019ve studied previously. The axillary bud is another very small shoot\ntip with a meristematic area. Axillary buds are found at a node and typically occur where\na leaf petiole attaches to a stem. The axillary buds in this stage of growth are inactive, but\nin time may begin active cell division and develop into new branches off of the main stem.\nThe coleus micrograph is clearly stem tissue because you can see leaves and leaf\nprimordia, so where are the nodes and internodes? The region where the leaves are\nattached, and where you find the axillary buds, is a node. Above this is the internode, and\nat the top where you find the leaf primordia is another node. 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 209\nApical meristem with root cap. Berkshire Community College, Public Domain.\nThe root meristem looks very different from the shoot apical meristem. Recall that, unlike\nbranches that develop at nodes, lateral roots are formed adventitiously, as the result of\nmeristematic activity in the pericycle cells of the root\u2019s vascular system in the zone of\nmaturation. We don\u2019t see a node-internode structure like we saw with the coleus shoot\ntip.\nWhen meristem cells divide, whether in the shoot or the root, one of the two resulting\nsister cells typically continues to be a meristem cell. The other sister cell divides a few\nmore times and then differentiates into dermal, cortex, or vascular tissue in the stem or\nroot. Meristem cells that remain meristematic are called initials because they continue\nto divide, producing new cells. The other sister cells that divide once or twice more and\nthen differentiate are called derivative cells. The xylem and phloem tissues that result\nfrom differentiation of derivative cells are called primary xylem and primary phloem,\nwhere the word \u201cprimary\u201d signals that the cells originated from cell divisions of the apical\nmeristem.\nTo reiterate, young stems and roots have primary xylem and primary phloem that formed 210 | 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nas a result of differentiation of derivative cells. Primary xylem and primary phloem cells\ntrace back to an apical meristem.\nEarlier you learned the arrangement of the vascular tissues in monocot and dicot stems\nand roots. Remember that mitotic cell divisions in the apical meristem result in\nlengthening of the root or shoot through production of new cells plus the elongation of\nthose cells. With a few exceptions, this is the only type of growth \u2014 growth that is initiated\nby cell division in the apical meristem \u2014 you\u2019ll find in monocots. Dicots, however, have\nanother type of growth \u2014 from a different type of meristem \u2014 that results in thickening\nof the stem.\nReview questions\n1. If shown a micrograph of an apical meristem, how would you determine whether it is from a\nroot or a shoot?\n2. What happens to the initial cell mentioned in the question above? Does it continue to divide?\nSecondary growth (thickening): Introducing lateral\nmeristems\nWatch this video for a closer look at apical and lateral meristems (2:26)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1078#oembed-1 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 211\nUnlike annual herbaceous plants that only survive for one growing season, and whose\nstem and root cells trace back to cell divisions of the apical meristems, woody plants and\nshrubs are perennial dicots that have the capacity for secondary growth and can survive\nfrom year to year.\nSome annual herbaceous dicot plants, like tomatoes, can have secondary growth, but\nfor now let\u2019s consider those the exceptions and focus on perennial dicot woody plants.\nSecondary growth is the result of activity by a special type of meristem called a lateral\nmeristem. As with apical meristems, lateral meristems are made up of cells that undergo\nmitotic cell division. Mitosis in lateral meristems results in lateral growth (thickening of\nthe stem or root) and adds to the girth of a plant rather than its length. Remember that\nlength is the outcome of cell division in the apical meristem plus elongation of those cells.\nGirth or thickening is the result of lateral meristems. We\u2019ll learn about two types of lateral\nmeristems: vascular cambium, and cork cambium. 212 | 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nVascular cambium\nLet\u2019s start with the vascular cambium.\nThe three drawings on the right show a cross\nsection of a stem for an imaginary woody dicot. The\ntop drawing illustrates the stem early in the first\nyear of growth, and shows the vascular cylinders\narranged in a ring around the stem. The phloem is\noriented to the outside, the xylem to the inside. A\nthin layer of parenchyma cells between the xylem\nand phloem has differentiated into the fascicular\ncambium (fascicular refers to bundles, in this case,\ncambium in the vascular bundles). The fascicular\ncambium is meristematic and can divide to\nproduce new phloem toward the outside and new\nxylem to the inside. The new xylem and phloem\nproduced by the cambium are called 2o\n(secondary) xylem and 2o phloem. Recall that the\noriginal xylem and phloem that differentiated from\nthe apical meristem\u2019s derivative cells are called the\n1o (primary) xylem and 1o phloem.\nThe middle drawing is of the same stem later in the\nyear. The cortex (cortical) parenchyma cells that lay\nbetween the vascular cylinders directly in line with\nImages by Dr. Thomas L. Rost, emeritus professor\nthe fascicular cambium begin to differentiate into a\nat UC-Davis.\ntype of cambium called interfascicular cambium\n(cambium between the bundles). This is symbolized by the line connecting the vascular\ncylinders. This cambium is also meristematic, and produces 2o xylem and 2o phloem.\nThe cross section on the bottom illustrates the stem in its second or third year of growth,\nwhen there is a noticeable buildup of 2o xylem and 2o phloem with remnants of 1o xylem\nand 1o phloem.\nIn summary, the vascular cambium is a lateral meristem formed by differentiation of\nparenchyma cells located between the primary xylem and phloem into fascicular\ncambium, followed by differentiation of cortical parenchyma between the vascular 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 213\ncylinders into interfascicular cambium. After a few years of secondary growth, fascicular\nand interfascicular cambium can no longer be distinguished, and it is all simply known\nas vascular cambium. This layer of cambium runs vertically (assuming that the stem is\noriented vertically) and parallel to the surface of the woody stem.\nThe illustration below shows how the cambium divides to produce 2o xylem and 2o\nphloem, with the outside of the stem toward the top of the page. Frame #1 shows a\nsingle cambium cell (C). This cell divides mitotically (M) to form two cambium daughter\ncells (Frame #2). Frame #3 shows that the cambium cell on the top differentiates (D) into\na phloem cell (P-toward the outside) and the other cambium cell divides mitotically (M).\nCell division and differentiation from cambium to xylem/phloem. Tom Michaels\nThis type of cell division, in which new cells are formed either to the outside or inside, and\nthe cell wall that separates the two new cells is parallel to the outside of the stem, is called\npericlinal division. Periclinal division by the cambium makes new cells that add girth\nto the plant. The cells that are added subsequently differentiate into xylem and phloem\ndepending on their location to the outside or inside of the cambium. The meristem needs\nto divide periclinally to add girth to the plant stem.\nIn Frame #4, pay particular attention to a different type of cell division, where the\ncambium cell has divided so that the wall between the two cells is perpendicular to the\noutside of the stem. This is called anticlinal division. The meristem occasionally needs\nto divide anticlinally because as the stem is growing in girth, the diameter of the ring of\nvascular cambium must expand to keep up, or it will split into pieces and no longer form\na continuous ring around the stem. Frame #4 also shows that the cambium cell to the\ninside has differentiated into xylem (X). In Frame #5, the two cambial cells that formed\nfrom anticlinal division now each divide periclinally. 214 | 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nWatch this video for a demonstration of periclinal and anticlinal division (3:50)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Explain what is happening in Frames #6 and #7 in the drawing above. Note that there are\ntwo important changes: differentiation and anticlinal division.\nCork cambium\nLet\u2019s look at the second type of lateral meristem, cork cambium. Cork (called \u201cphellem\u201d\nin this image) provides a protective covering around the expanding trunk of the woody\nplant. 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 215\nPublic domain image labeled by Emily Tepe.\nCork develops in plants with secondary growth after the initiation of secondary xylem\nand phloem and the expansion of the stem and root\u2019s girth. Cortex parenchyma cells\nnext to the epidermis of the young stem differentiate into the cork cambium (also called\nphellogen), which is meristematic. The cork cambium lays down some new cells toward\nthe inside called phelloderm, but lays down most of its new cells to the outside, and these\nderivatives of the cork cambium differentiate into the cork cells. The cork cells are lined\nwith a waxy substance called suberin (we first saw this substance in conjunction with the\nCasparian strip around endodermis cells) that make the cells impermeable to water and\ngases. Breaks in the cork cells, called lenticels, allow gas and water exchange. You can\nsee these lenticels in corks from wine bottles (wine corks are made from the thick cork\nof the Cork Oak, Quercus suber). Cork cells die when they mature. These cells replace the\nprotective function provided by epidermis in young roots and stems. Cork cambium and\nits derivatives (phelloderm and cork) are called the periderm. 216 | 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nBotanically speaking, the word bark refers to all of the tissues exterior of the vascular\ncambium. So bark includes:\n\u2022 Primary and secondary phloem\n\u2022 Phelloderm if present\n\u2022 Cork cambium\n\u2022 Cork\nLook again at the list above and note that the phloem is part of the bark. This is often\noverlooked!\nCross section of trunk. Dpaczesniak. CC BY-SA 4.0.\nThis illustration summarizes the layers introduced above, but omits the phelloderm. If\nyou were to add a label for the phelloderm, where would it be? In mature trunks the\nphelloderm is quite a thin layer in the bark though, particularly relative to the cork layer,\nso that is probably why it is absent in this illustration.\nIf you peel bark from a living tree, you are exposing the surface of the vascular cambium of 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 217\nthe tree, and on the inside of the bark will be the phloem. Peeling off bark will kill the plant\nbecause you are removing phloem, which disrupts the ability of the plant to move sugars\nthrough the trunk of the tree, exposes the tree to moisture loss and predator invasion,\nand kills the vascular cambium through desiccation. Killing the vascular cambium halts\nproduction of new xylem which will subsequently interfere with water transpiration up the\nstem. This is what happens when rodents girdle the trunks of young fruit trees (left) just\nbelow the snow line as they feed on the tender tissues over winter.\nA tree\u2019s annual rings are found in the\nsecondary xylem. In the spring, the newly\nproduced xylem cells have thin walls and\nare large in diameter so they can\naccommodate the abundance of soil\nmoisture that is typical of April and May.\nAs the growing\nseason progresses\nand soil moisture\nlevels are depleted,\nthe cell walls of\nnewly produced\nxylem are thicker\nand the diameter of\nTrunk cross section\nshowing sapwood and\nthe xylem cells\nheartwood.

Emily Hoover\nlarge-celled spring wood from the\nfollowing year is noticeable, and this line of demarcation between late summer and spring\nxylem is called the annual ring. In the image to the right you can see the darker xylem,\ncalled heartwood, and the lighter xylem, called sapwood. Heartwood is older xylem that\nis clogged with resins that darken the cells and limit their ability to transport water.\nSapwood is younger, resin-free, and still functioning to conduct water up the trunk.\nThere isn\u2019t nearly as much phloem as xylem in a woody plant. Phloem isn\u2019t produced as 218 | 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY\nrapidly as xylem, and is crushed between the vascular and cork cambium layers, so we\ndon\u2019t see annual rings in phloem.\nWatch this video for a look at what makes up bark (2:38)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

If some kids in your neighborhood get hold of a little hatchet and chop off thin slices of bark\nall the way around the base of one of your trees, what will happen to the tree? Why?\nWhat about roots?\nRoots of woody perennial dicots also have vascular and cork cambium. The vascular\ncambium arises from parenchyma cells lying between the xylem and phloem in roots,\njust as in stems. The illustration below shows the initiation of the vascular cambium in a\nyoung root. It looks like a trace of white between the primary xylem in the middle and the\nprimary phloem in each of the four lobes of the vascular cylinder. With age, the cambium\nencircles the root and produces (secondary) xylem to the inside, and (secondary) phloem\nto outside, again just as in stems. Older roots with secondary growth also have a periderm 7.1 MERISTEM MORPHOLOGY | 219\nsimilar to that found in the stem that replaces the function of the epidermis.

For a visual image of these compressed\nnodes, imagine pushing down on a telescoping radio antenna so that the antenna sections\nslide down into each other. At the very top of the fully compressed antenna you\u2019ll still see\nthe tips of each of the sections of the antenna, and this resembles the highly compressed\nnodes and internodes of a stem. The region of the stem containing these four compressed\nnodes is called the receptacle.\nWe have seen other examples of compressed stems with very short internodes, including\nthe basal plate of the onion. In each of these cases we find leaves attached to these tightly\ncompressed nodes. In the onion, the leaves are modified for water and nutrient storage\nas bulb scales. In the dandelion, the leaves are unmodified, but are arranged in a low-\ngrowing rosette. The flower is another example of a very compact stem with four nodes\nand three internodes. The leaves on this stem are highly modified to serve a reproductive\nfunction. They are so highly modified that, except for the structures at the fourth node,\nthe parts don\u2019t resemble leaves at all. 222 | 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY\nMain parts of a mature flower. LadyofHats, Public Domain\nYou will read and learn both the term carpel and the term pistil. You can use either\ncarpel or pistil in this course, but we\u2019ll usually say carpel. Pistil is sometimes still used\nfor the structure if it is composed of two or more fused carpels.\nThe flower is actually a shortened branch containing a stem with four very compact nodes.\nThis short stem is called the receptacle. From the nodes on the receptacle emerge four\ndifferent kinds of modified leaves that collectively have these names:\n\u2022 Calyx: the fourth node, at the base of the receptacle, individually called sepals;\nthese are the parts that still bear some resemblance to leaves\n\u2022 Corolla: the third node, individually called petals\n\u2022 Androecium (Greek derivation meaning \u201cmen\u2019s house\u201d): the second node\n\u2022 Gynoecium (Greek derivation meaning \u201cwomen\u2019s house\u201d): the first node at the tip of\nthe receptacle\nFor clarity, instead of using a number to refer to a particular receptacle node, we\u2019ll use the\nname of the modified leaves attached to that node. For instance, we\u2019ll call the fourth node\nwhere the calyx is attached the \u201ccalyx node,\u201d the third node where the corolla is attached\nthe \u201ccorolla node,\u201d and so on. 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY | 223\nWe\u2019ve noted that the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium are modified leaves.\nThis may be surprising because, in particular, the androecium and gynoecium are highly\nspecialized for sexual reproduction.\nStrawberry flower. Image by Andrew Petran and Emily Tepe.\nThe nodes where these modified leaves are attached are often called whorls since usually\ntwo or more of these modified leaves are attached radially around the node. Monocots\ngenerally have three modified leaves attached at each node, while dicots usually have four\nor five attached at each node. One interesting feature of the strawberry flower shown\nabove is the enlarged gynoecium node of the receptacle that is covered by carpels. The\nreceptacle will become the red culinary \u201cfruit,\u201d while the actual botanical fruits will be the\nachenes (you\u2019ve considered them seeds, but they are a type of fruit) embedded into the\nouter surface of the receptacle. 224 | 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY\nWatch the next two videos to learn more about flower parts and about the specialized\nflorets of an Asteraceae flower.\nWatch this video on flower structure.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

What is the relationship between a whorl and a node? In what way is this relationship\nconnected to the concept that a flower\u2019s corolla is made up of modified leaves?\nCalyx\nThe fourth whorl at the base of the receptacle is the calyx whorl. The calyx is made 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY | 225\nup of modified leaves called sepals. In some species the sepals look like miniature\nleaves; they are green and photosynthetic. In other species, like the lily, they are showy\nand almost indistinguishable from the petals. When sepals and petals are showy and\nindistinguishable, they are called tepals.\nThe saffron flower, below, is the source of the rare spice gathered from the long, red-\norange stamens that you can barely see inside the opening flower. Notice that there are\napparently no sepals. That is because the three sepals and three petals of this monocot\nplant look the same; they are therefore tepals.\nPhoto of a saffron flower.

The corolla is composed of\nhighly modified leaves called petals. Petals attract pollinators through their bright colors\nand showy patterns. Petals may also exude nectar near their site of attachment to the\nreceptacle to reward insects who visit the flowers and, when doing so, spread pollen from\nflower to flower. Color patterns on the petals may simulate a \u201cbulls eye\u201d or landing strip\nthat provides the insect with a visual guide pointing to the location of the nectar, as in the\nviolet, below.\nPhoto of a violet. Inga Munsinger Cotton, CC BY 2.0\nThe calyx and corolla are collectively named the perianth. Some flowers lack a perianth.\nCorn is an example; it is wind pollinated and has no need for a showy perianth to attract\ninsect pollinators. 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY | 227\nReview question\n1. Sepals and petals are modifications of what other plant structure?\nAndroecium\nRose of Sharon flower Tim Green CC BY 2.0 228 | 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY\nTomato androecium. pxfuel.com Public domain.\nThe third whorl as we move towards the tip of the receptacle is the androecium whorl.\nThe androecium is composed of modified leaves called stamens. Stamens are found\nin many different arrangements. The picture of the Rose of Sharon flower, in the top\nphoto above, shows an androecium composed of an abundance of stamens in an open\narrangement. In contrast, the 10 stamens in the tomato androecium (bottom photo\nabove) are fused into a cone that surrounds the gynoecium. The tomato\u2019s cone of stamens\nis a structure through which the tomato encourages self-pollination. It is difficult for\npollen from another plant to get to the stigma of the carpel before pollen from the\nflower\u2019s own stamen.\nStamens have two distinct components:\nFilament (a long stalk)\n\u2022 The filament has an architectural function, in that it lifts the anther to a position\nwhere it can effectively release pollen grains into/onto the pollinator.\n\u2022 It also has a physiological (or some might say plumbing) function, in that it connects\nthe anther to the plant\u2019s vascular system so that it can receive water and nutrients. 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY | 229\nCross section of a developing flower.

Gustav Hegi. Public domain\nWhen you begin to compare structural differences among flowers, you will find that the\nposition of the calyx and corolla relative to the ovary differs between some species. A 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY | 231\nmore complete description of that relative alignment can be seen in the picture above,\nand is described here:\nEpigynous flowers\nOther flower parts are attached ABOVE the ovary.\nThis is called an inferior ovary because the gynoecium node isn\u2019t positioned right at\nthe tip of the receptacle, but rather is sunken down into the receptacle below where the\nandroecium, calyx, and corolla are attached. This means that the ovary is surrounded\nby other tissues, primarily receptacle tissue. This will have an impact on whether any\naccessory plant tissues make up the fruit. More on that later.\nPerigynous flowers\nThe ovary is surrounded by the fused bases of flower parts (calyx, corolla, androecium)\nthat surround the ovary.\nHypogynous flowers\nOther flower parts are attached BELOW the ovary. This is called a superior ovary because\nthe ovary sits above the point of attachment of the top whorl.\nA flower that has all four of the parts described above \u2014 Calyx, Corolla, Androecium,\nand Gynoecium \u2014 is called a \"complete\" flower. Flowers missing one or more parts\nare described as \u201cincomplete.\u201d We noted earlier that corn produces a flower without\nperianth. Such a flower could be described as \u201cincomplete.\u201d\nReview questions\n1. Sperm are produced from microspores contained in what plant part? To which whorl is this\npart attached?\n2. Eggs are produced from megaspores contained in what plant part? To which whorl is this 232 | 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY\npart attached?\n3. Which type of ovary is shown in the tutorial graphic at the beginning of this lecture from\nwhich you learned the parts of the flower?\n4. In what way does the filament of the stamen have an architectural function? How might this\nmake a difference to the plant\u2019s reproduction?\nPollination patterns\nA flower with both androecium and gynoecium \u2014 that is both male and female parts \u2014 is\ncalled perfect or bisexual or hermaphroditic. Perfect flowers may be capable of self-\npollination. Pollen produced within the flower may fall on a stigma in the same flower,\nand the sperm that it carries may fertilize the egg in the ovule. Sometimes, the timing of\nevents during the stages of flower maturation encourage self-pollination. For instance, in\nsome species the anther matures and pollen is shed, and the stigma is receptive, before\nthe flower even opens. This is called cleistogamy, and is common in self-pollinating\nagricultural crops. Self pollination is encouraged because it is difficult for pollen from\nanother flower to get to the stigma within a closed flower before pollen from the flower\u2019s\nown anther gets there first. Flowers that are fully open when mature are chasmogamous\nand facilitate pollination from other flowers.\nOn the other hand, the development timing of male and female organs in a different\nspecies might encourage outcrossing by releasing pollen when the stigma in the same\nflower is not receptive, or vice versa. This relative timing is called Protandry when the\npollen is shed before the stigma is receptive, and Protogyny when the stigma is receptive\nprior to pollen shed. 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY | 233\nMale and female watermelon flowers. Pollinator. CC BY-SA 3.0\nThere are also genetic mechanisms called self-incompatibility, through which the stigma\nand style recognize pollen produced by the same plant and stop fertilization, thereby\navoiding self pollination and promoting mixing genetic material (DNA) from diverse\nindividuals.\nSome plants produce imperfect male and imperfect female flowers on the same plant.\nThe flowers containing only androecium are called staminate (male) flowers while the\nflowers with only gynoecium are called pistillate (female) flowers. Squash and melons,\nsuch as the watermelon shown above, are examples of plants with imperfect flowers.\nCorn and cucumber are others. Notice the enlarged receptacle and inferior ovary at the\nbase of the pistillate flower of the watermelon. These flowers, because they are missing\none of the four parts, could also be described as incomplete.\nFor the ultimate avoidance of self pollination, some plants have only staminate or only 234 | 7.2 FLOWER MORPHOLOGY\npistillate flowers. A single-sex plant like this is called dioecious (plants with both sexes,\nwhether perfect or imperfect flowers, are called monoecious).

CC BY-SA 3.0\nA fruit, in the botanical sense, is the ripened ovary together with the seeds within the\novary. People often think of a fruit from the culinary point of view, considering it to be the\npart of a plant that has seeds and when ripe is ready to eat, and think of vegetables as\na savory food that is any edible part of a plant not associated with seeds (these include\nroots, stems and leaves). But some plant parts that, when we wear our chef\u2019s hat, we\nthink of as vegetables, are really botanical fruits. That green pepper chopped up on your\npizza is a botanical fruit, as is the tomato that\u2019s pureed to make the pizza sauce. A squash\nis another botanical fruit that we treat like a vegetable in the kitchen. Adding to the\nconfusion is the legal decision that tomato fruits are vegetables (Nix v. Hedden 1893; The\nWashington Post). In Plant Propagation, we\u2019ll define fruits from the botanical standpoint:\nthe ripened ovary of a flower, together with the seeds within that ovary.\nReview the diagram below of the tomato flower and fruit to be sure you know exactly\nwhich parts of the flower develop into the fruit. In the flower, the ovary wall provides\nprotection to the ovules that contain the egg \u2014 the female gametes. The egg cells within\nthe ovules are fertilized by the sperm from the pollen, the ovules develop into the seeds,\nand the ovary matures into the fruit. For some species, fruits are brown, green, starchy,\nbitter, proteinaceous, dry, and durable. They may be inedible, unpalatable, or so small\nas to be terribly inconvenient as a food. The ovary wall doesn\u2019t always become a sweet 246 | 8.1 FRUIT MORPHOLOGY\nand fleshy fruit like a peach. In kidney beans, for instance, it becomes a dry and brittle\nprotective pod. Nevertheless, both the peach and the bean pod are botanical fruits.\nThe illustration shows a cross section of a tomato, with the fleshy ovary wall around the\noutside, locules (chambers) within the tomato, and seeds forming within the locules.

Pericarp = around the carpel. The pericarp can be dry, as with bean pods, or\nfleshy like a peach, or sometimes both, as in an avocado, where the outer layer is leathery\nand the inner layer is fleshy. 248 | 8.1 FRUIT MORPHOLOGY\nThe pericarp of a fleshy fruit typically has three layers, and each may have distinct\ncharacteristics. The photo of a peach below shows the layers making up the pericarp:\n\u2022 Exocarp: the outer layer of the pericarp (also called the epicarp)\n\u2022 Mesocarp: the middle layer (fleshy in this example)\n\u2022 Endocarp: the inner layer (hardened with sclerenchyma cells in the coconut example\nbelow)\nWhat type of cell makes up this hard shell of a walnut or peach?

It may have\noil glands (like in oranges and lemons) or hairs (like in kiwifruit). Similarly, mesocarps\nand endocarps may have various modifications that make them hard, soft, or leathery\ndepending on the species. Remember that the pericarp is ripened ovary wall tissue and\nthe exo-, meso- and endocarp are layers of that ripened ovary wall.\nThe coconut is a fruit.

The ripened ovaries from that one flower coalesce into\none larger unit, but you can still see evidence of the individual carpels. The raspberry, for\ninstance, comes from one flower with many carpels. As the pericarps mature they mature\ntogether to form the thimble of the raspberry that we eat.

How would you classify the corn caryopsis and\nthe sunflower achene in this regard?\nAccessory fruits\nEarlier, we saw how one or more of the other flower parts (androecium, corolla and calyx) 262 | 8.1 FRUIT MORPHOLOGY\ncan be attached below the ovary (hypogynous parts, superior ovary), above the ovary\n(epigynous parts, inferior ovary), or around the middle of the ovary (perigynous parts). In\nthe case of epigynous and perigynous parts there are tissues surrounding the ovary to\nwhich the other flower parts attach and that can also adhere to the outside of the ovary\nand become part of the fruit. One example of a fruit from this type of flower where there\nis accessory tissue (hypanthium) adhering to the outside of the ovary wall is the pome,\nexamples of which are the apple, pear, and quince. Another example is the strawberry,\nwhere together the receptacle tissue and ovary wall tissue form the strawberry fruit. Since\nit isn\u2019t part of the ovary wall, the receptacle tissue is considered an accessory tissue, so the\nstrawberry, instead of being a true fruit, is a type of fruit called an accessory fruit.\nApple.

The strawberry is an accessory\nfruit because the red fleshy part we eat is made up not of the ovary wall, but primarily of\nreceptacle tissue. The strawberry is also an aggregate fruit formed from multiple ovaries\npresent in one flower. The fruit is an achene that contains the single seed from a single\novary attached to the outside of the receptacle. 264 | 8.1 FRUIT MORPHOLOGY\nReview activity\n1.

All of the progeny propagated from the same plant contain\nthe same genes as the parent plant, and the progeny are also identical to each other.\nDifferences among progeny or between parent and progeny may arise as a result of\nmutation, but this is rare. More likely, any differences among plants that have been\nasexually propagated from the same parent occur because the growing environment\ndiffers from plant to plant in some important way (fertility, water, light). The way the plant\nlooks and performs in a particular environment is called its phenotype. The collection of\ngenes the plant contains is called its genotype. Vegetative propagation results in identical\ngenotypes, but two plants with identical genotypes may have different phenotypes if they\nare grown in contrasting environments.\nSexual reproduction in weedy, native, or undomesticated plants typically results in seeds\nthat are genetically different from either parent, and in progeny that are all genetically\ndifferent from one another. Sexual reproduction in domesticated plants can also result\nin genetically diverse seed, but for those domesticated plants that are highly inbred,\nlike peas, beans, and cereals other than corn (like barley, wheat, oats, and rice), sexual\nreproduction can also result in seeds that are genetically identical to the parent. For now, 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY | 271\nremember that sexual reproduction means that a seed is formed as a result of fusion of a\nsperm and egg cell, and that there is the potential for progeny to differ from the parent(s).\nSexual reproduction, and the genetically variable progeny that result, give a plant species\na great deal of flexibility to adapt to new habitats and environmental conditions. Some\nprogeny might be extremely well adapted to new niches and can thrive there, while some\nwill not fit and will not survive and reproduce. To assist the species in spreading, the seeds\nof the plants that successfully reproduce often have strategies for dispersal away from the\nparent plant. This spread the species to diverse locations and new ecological niches, and\nalso reduces the likelihood of too many plants of the same species competing with each\nother in a limited space for the same scarce resources.\nSeed formation is normally assumed to be the result of sexual reproduction rather than\nvegetative propagation. In rare cases, however, an embryo can develop solely from\nmaternal tissue with no fusion of egg and sperm. This is called apomixis. Apomixis\nis really a form of asexual reproduction disguised as sexual reproduction. The process\nresults in a seed, but the embryo in the seed isn\u2019t the result of sex \u2014 the fusion of male\nand female gametes. All of the progeny are identical to the parent because the embryo is\nactually a clone (genetically identical offspring) of the plant on which the seed is produced.\nKentucky bluegrass reproduces this way, as does dandelion. It is ironic that our lawns are\noften inhabited by two apomictic species \u2026 the Kentucky bluegrass we struggle to grow,\nand the dandelions many homeowners go to great extremes to eradicate.\nBasic seed morphology\nSeeds have three main functions:\nPropagation of the plant\nThis is accomplished by the embryo, which is the nascent (new, young) plant resulting\nfrom the combination of genes from the male sperm, transmitted by the pollen, to\nthe female egg, held in an ovule in the ovary. The embryo has an axis with one end\ndifferentiating into the shoot and the other into the root.\nNutrient storage\nTwo types of structures can store nutrients in the seed \u2014 the cotyledon and the\nendosperm. The nutrients fuel growth of the embryo. 272 | 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY\nProtection\nThe embryo and nutrient source need a tough covering for protection from the\nenvironment and predators, and this is typically, but not always, provided by a structure\ncalled the seed coat (sometimes called the testa).\nCross section of kidney bean. Tom Michaels\nThe drawing above shows a simple cross section of a kidney bean seed (a dicot, but only\nshowing one cotyledon), illustrating these three functions. The kidney-shaped part is the\noutline of the cotyledon, the main mass of the bean seed and the site of stored nutrients.\nSandwiched between the cotyledon halves is the embryo, which is the nascent plant. On\nthe outside of the cotyledon is a thin layer that is the protective seed coat. The kidney\nbean seeds we see in the grocery store have a seed coat that typically has a light or dark\nmaroon color. In peanuts, the different structures are easy to see when you pull the two\ncotyledons apart.\nFirst function: Propagation of the plant by the embryo\nIn flowering plants the embryo is normally the result of fusion of egg and sperm. The\negg is held within an ovule, which in turn is held within the ovary, which can hold several 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY | 273\novules, depending on the species. The egg is typically fertilized by sperm from pollen. The\nmaturing ovule develops within the ovary of the maternal plant.\nEmbryo. Tom Michaels\nA mature seed has an embryo with a linear arrangement of parts. This arrangement is\ncalled the embryo axis. The drawing above shows the embryo axis from the kidney bean,\nstraightened out to show the individual structures.\n\u2022 Embryo axis \u2014 the embryonic root and shoot\n\u2022 Parts making up the shoot tissue of the embryo axis:\n\u25e6 Plumule \u2014 the first true leaves of the plant that you can sometimes see already\nattached to the embryo. These leaves will emerge from the seed, rise above the\nsoil surface, and start to collect energy from the sun.\n\u25e6 Point of attachment \u2014 the spot shown in red in the diagram (it\u2019s not red on a\nreal embryo) on the embryo axis where the cotyledon attaches. The cotyledon is\nattached to the embryo, and is actually part of the embryo. In the case of the\nbean, the cotyledon is a nutrient storage organ and the nutrients flow to the\nembryo through the point of attachment of the cotyledon to the embryo axis.\n\u25e6 Epicotyl \u2014 the part of the embryo axis that is above (epi-) the point of\nattachment of the cotyledons\n\u25e6 Hypocotyl \u2014 the part of the embryo axis that is shoot tissue below (hypo-) the 274 | 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY\npoint of attachment of the cotyledons, but above the radical. The hypocotyl is\nthe part of the shoot between the attachment of the cotyledon and the start of\nthe root (radicle).\n\u2022 Part making up the root tissue of the embryo axis:\n\u25e6 Radicle \u2014 the embryonic root tissue\nAt the tip of the epicotyl is the shoot apical meristem that will produce new nodes and\ninternodes. If you\u2019re counting nodes on the embryonic axis, the first node on the stem\nstarting from the point of transition of root to shoot is the point where the cotyledons\nattach. The cotyledons are actually embryonic leaves. The second node is where the\nplumule is attached.\nAt the tip of the radicle is the root apical meristem that will produce the primary root.\nReview questions\n1. Differentiate among embryo axis, epicotyl, hypocotyl and cotyledon. Which are derived from\nthe cell resulting from the fusion of egg and sperm?\n2. Describe why apomixis results in a seed that is actually a form of asexual propagation.\n3. Of the tissues making up the embryo axis (plumule, epicotyl, hypocotyl, radicle), which are\nshoot tissue and which are root tissue?\nDouble fertilization and the endosperm\nIn flowering plants (angiosperms), there is a phenomenon called \u201cdouble fertilization.\u201d\nThe angiosperm pollen grain holds two sperm cells. One fertilizes the egg, and the\nresulting zygote grows to become the embryo. The other unites with two other maternal\nnuclei, called polar bodies, and these three nuclei together grow to become a tissue called\nendosperm (like the meat and milk of the coconut). This will be covered in more detail\nwhen we study meiosis and gametogenesis. For now, remember that in flowering plants\nthere is a process called double fertilization that results in an embryo and an endosperm. 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY | 275\nCross section of corn seed. Sarah Greenwood. CC BY-SA 4.0\nIn grasses, like the corn in the illustration above, the endosperm is the major energy and\nnutrient storage tissue. This is different from the kidney bean, where the cotyledon is the\nstorage organ. There is a cotyledon in the corn seed as well, but instead of storing energy\nand nutrients, it helps break down, absorb, and transfer the energy and nutrients stored\nin the endosperm to the embryo. Also in many monocots, there is a sheath covering\nthe plumule and epicotyl that provides protection. This sheath is called the coleoptile. A\nsimilar sheath covers the radicle, and is called the coleorhiza. Coleoptile and coleorhiza\nare terms used specifically with plants in the grass family (Poaceae), and not in other\nfamilies within monocots. Both function in providing protection to the emerging shoot\nand root. In the corn seed, the three functions of 1) propagation, 2) protection, and 3)\nnutrition are satisfied by the:\n\u2022 Embryo (shown in this illustration extending from the shoot to the root) and that will\npropagate a new plant. 276 | 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY\n\u2022 Endosperm tissue that provides energy and nutrition for the embryo.\n\u2022 Pericarp protecting everything inside. Remember that in corn, which produces a type\nof fruit called a caryopsis, the pericarp is fused right to the seed. The pericarp is the\nmature ovary wall of the female corn flower in the ear (labeled \u2018seed coat\u2019 in the\nillustration above).\nThis summary table contrasts corn and bean seed components:\nCotyledon Endosperm Seed Coat Pericarp\nRemnants (these\nProtection\ntissues are absent or\nCorn Energy (outermost\nEnergy storage only fragments of\n\u2013 monocot absorption layer of the\ntissue in the mature\ncorn kernel)\nseed)\nRemnants (these\ntissues are absent or Protection (outermost\nBean \u2013 Energy\nonly fragments of layer of the bean Protection (pod)\ndicot storage\ntissue in the mature seed)\nseed)\nSecond function: Storing energy and nutrients for embryo\ngrowth\nAmong flowering plants, energy and nutrients can be stored in the seed in the:\n\u2022 Cotyledon\n\u2022 Endosperm\nWhat types of energy and nutrients are stored in these tissues? Think about the seeds you\neat, and you can probably name many of these nutrients.\nCarbohydrates\n\u2022 Provide energy \u2014 complex molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.\n\u2022 In plants, carbohydrates include starch and sugar.\nProtein 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY | 277\n\u2022 Sources of amino acids for production of enzymes and other nitrogen-rich\ncompounds.\n\u25e6 Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.\n\u25e6 Protein is the solid material in tofu (pressed curds from coagulated soy milk).\nThere are several different categories of protein in seeds based on the specific\nchemical structures of the molecules. Gluten is a type of protein found in wheat\nendosperm that confers elasticity to bread dough so that the stretchy dough\ntraps the carbon dioxide given off by yeast in the bread-making process and\nforms a tender loaf full of air pockets.\nLipids\nPlant oils, called triglycerides, are compact molecules for storing energy in a more\ncompact way than in starch and sugar.\nWe are bombarded with a great deal of confusing nutritional information about lipids in\nour foods. When you encounter nutritional claims, keep this information in mind:\n\u2022 The building blocks of a triglyceride\nare a Glycerol molecule plus 3 Fatty Acids. The illustration shows a triglyceride made\nup of glycerol linked to three saturated fatty acids. 278 | 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY\n\u2022 Fatty acids are long chains of carbon atoms with two hydrogen atoms attached to\neach carbon, except where there is a double bond between adjacent carbons on the\nchain. In the case of a double bond, each carbon involved in the double bond has\nonly one attached hydrogen atom.\n\u2022 Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds in the chain, and all carbon atoms in the\ninterior of the chain have two attached hydrogen atoms \u2014 they are thus saturated\nwith hydrogen atoms.\n\u2022 Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds between one or more\ncarbon atoms in the chain. These fatty acids lack some hydrogen atoms, and\ntherefore the carbon atoms are not saturated with hydrogen \u2014 they\nare unsaturated.\n\u2022 You have probably heard nutritional claims about saturated and unsaturated fats.\nThe difference between the two is whether all the carbon atoms in the fatty acids are\nsaturated with hydrogen atoms, or are missing hydrogen atoms as a result of double\nbonds in the carbon chain. Plant oils tend to be unsaturated, which results in them\nbeing liquid at room temperature \u2014 they have a low melting point. Animal fats tend\nto be saturated, which results in them being solid at room temperature \u2014 they have\na higher melting point. If you are interested in more of the chemical nature of fatty\nacids, check out this link to The Fat Primer (optional reading).\nNutrient differences between monocots and dicots (legumes in\nparticular)\nDicots\nAs noted above, seeds with two cotyledons tend to have cotyledons whose function is\nstorage. Legumes (Fabaceae family) like beans, peas, soybeans, and lentils are dicots that\ntend to store large amounts of protein in their cotyledons. Some legumes have high\nprotein, high lipid, and low carbohydrates (like soybean and peanut); these are called\noilseeds because they have high lipid content and oil can be squeezed or otherwise\nextracted from them. Others have high protein, low lipid, and high carbohydrate (like\npea and bean), and these are called pulse crops. Pulse crops are hugely important foods 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY | 279\nbecause they are edible protein sources. They are a key source of protein in vegetarian\ndiets.\nMonocots\nMonocots have a cotyledon too, but as noted earlier the cotyledon is primarily used for\nabsorption. In cereals the endosperm stores the nutrients, which tend to be primarily\nstarch and sugar and low amounts of protein and oil.\nAs a rule, legume seeds are high protein (and in some cases like soybean and peanut high\noil), while cereal grains like corn, wheat, oats, barley, and rice are high in starch.\nReview questions\n1. What seed structure(s) contains carbohydrates?\n2. What is the key characteristic of an unsaturated fatty acid?\nThird function: Protecting the embryo and nutrients\nSeeds have two layers of protection:\n\u2022 The seed coat, which originates as ovule wall tissue.\n\u2022 The pericarp, which originates as ovary wall tissue. 280 | 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY\nThe line drawing of a flower cross-section, right, shows\nsepals, petals, stamens (made up of a filament and\nanther), and carpel or pistil (made up of stigma, style,\nand ovary). Also identified are the ovary wall and the\novule wall. The ovary is at the base of the carpel and\nholds the ovules. The ovules are protected by the ovary\nand hold the egg. When the flower is fertilized, a pollen\ntube germinates from the pollen grain and grows into\nthe stigma and down through the style. The sperm\nfollows the pollen tube into the ovary. One sperm\nunites with the egg and the resulting zygote becomes\nthe embryo. The other sperm unites with two polar\nnuclei to form the endosperm. This is the double Cross section of a flower. Tom Michaels\nfertilization noted earlier.\nAs the seed matures, the cells inside the ovule multiply and grow. The ovule wall, which\nis made up of maternal cells called integument tissue, matures to become the seed coat.\nAn example of a seed coat is the red or tan \u201cskin\u201d on a peanut. The ovary wall (note the\nimportant difference between the words \u201covule\u201d and \u201covary\u201d) matures into the protective\ncover called the pericarp. Again using peanut as an example, the pericarp is the \u201cshell\u201d of\nthe peanut. So peanuts-in-the-shell are an example of a pericarp (shell, ovary wall tissue)\nand a seed coat (skin, ovule wall tissue) protecting the cotyledons and embryo within the\nseed.\nIn contrast, when corn matures, the ovule wall smashes up against the ovary wall as the\ncells inside multiply and enlarge. The ovule wall cells disintegrate, so at maturity there are\nonly remnants of the seed coat. The ovary wall matures into the pericarp of the corn seed,\nwhich is the hard exterior of the seed.\nThese words belong together:\n\u2022 Ovule wall \u2014 Seed coat\n\u2022 Ovary wall \u2014 Pericarp\nYou might be interested to know that you are probably wearing integument/seed coat\ntissue right now. The fine fibers attached to the outside of cotton seeds are made up of\nlong chains of single cells of integument tissue and are extensions of the seed coat. These\nfibers are removed from cotton seeds, spun into a fiber, and woven into fabric. 9.1 SEED MORPHOLOGY | 281\nReview question\n1. When you eat green beans or snow peas as a (culinary) vegetable, are you eating pericarp,\nseed coat, or both? 282 | 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\n9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the process of seed germination.\n\u2022 List the external factors that are required for seed germination.\n\u2022 Understand dormancy and the conditions needed for germination to occur.\nSeed \u2014 a living plant in a quiescent state\nIn the ovary, within the ovule, after egg and sperm unite to form the zygote, the zygote cell\nrepeatedly divides and develops into an embryo. The embryo differentiates into different\nstructures \u2014 plumule, radicle, cotyledon(s), and the endosperm, seed coat, or pericarp\ndevelop. Once this development has occurred, the embryo\u2019s metabolism slows down to\nnearly zero and the maternal plant stops pumping energy into the seed. The nascent\nplant contained within the seed \u2014 really an embryo surrounded by nutritive tissue and\na protective covering \u2014 is now independent of the mother plant. The seed, which is the\nnext generation of plant, enters a quiescent phase.\nRecall that the seed contains:\n\u2022 An embryo, which is the new plant,\n\u2022 A nutrient source (typically endosperm and/or cotyledon), and\n\u2022 A protective covering (typically a seed coat and/or pericarp) 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY | 283\nWhy do plants produce seeds? Because seeds allow plants to:\n\u2022 Propagate the next generation\n\u2022 Generate genetically variable offspring that can be sorted through natural selection\n\u2022 Survive harsh conditions\n\u2022 Disperse into new environments\nRed chile pepper. Nir Sinay. CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\nThe first of these reasons is obvious, to propagate. One parent plant generates many\nseeds, and through these seeds potentially bears many offspring. A kidney bean plant, for\ninstance, might average 4 seeds per pod and have 20 pods hanging on the plant, so one\nplant yields 80 seeds. A nice ear of field corn will have 16 rows of kernels with 40 kernels\nper row, for a yield of 640 seeds. The tiny hot pepper in your garden has over 50 seeds,\nand 20 peppers on a plant would yield 1,000 seeds.\nThe second reason, genetically variable offspring, results from cross-pollination\n(mentioned above under Seed Morphology), which is particularly common in wild,\nundomesticated plants. When plants cross-pollinate, an egg is formed within the maternal\nplant. The genetic constitution of the developing embryo within the seed is 50% from the\npaternal plant, 50% from the maternal plant. The particular combination of genes in the\ndeveloping seed is different from that in either parent plant, and from the other seeds\non the same maternal parent. The seeds share some of the same genes, but the specific\ncombination of genes is different. That difference results in genetic variability, which can\nbe expressed as differences in plant height, flower color, leaf shape, fruit size, or other 284 | 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\nmorphological or physiological characteristics. In nature, this variability is the raw material\non which natural selection operates. In plant breeding, it is the resource that sustains our\nefforts to select improved plant varieties.\nDue to their protective coating and quiescent metabolism, seeds can survive harsh\nconditions that will kill the parent plant such, as freezing cold, protracted drought, and\neven fires. Once conditions are again favorable for plant growth, the seeds can then\ngerminate.\nSeed dispersal\nWatch this video for an explanation of seed dispersal in space and time (2:20)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

CC\nBY-SA 2.0\nSeeds disperse from the maternal parent plant \u201cin space\u201d through many wonderful and 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY | 285\ncreative mechanisms for hitching rides on the wind, on animals, and sometimes in animals\nas they are eaten, pass through the gut, and are excreted.\nYou have probably seen fluffy cottonwood (poplar) seeds floating on the summer breeze,\npulled burdock seeds off your sweater after bushwhacking through the woods in the\nfall, or washed bird guano full of mulberry seeds off your car\u2019s windshield. These seeds\nall used strategies for dispersal in space. Vanderbilt University\u2019s Bioimages (optional)\nincludes photos of mechanisms that help spatially disperse seeds.\nSeeds also disperse from the maternal parent plant \u201cin time.\u201d Some have dormancy\nmechanisms that delay germination until the next favorable growing season, which might\nbe a year from now or even several years from now. Seeds are considered dormant if they\nare alive and don\u2019t germinate even if provided with favorable conditions for germination.\nThere are many dormancy mechanisms; we\u2019ll address some of them later.\nIf you\u2019ve ever dug up new sections of your yard for a garden, did you notice that, a few\nweeks after planting veggies or flowers in the spring, you saw a big flush of weeds? And\nif you pulled up all of those weeds and somehow prevented any new seeds from landing\nin the garden, you still got a big flush of weeds the next year? This is called the soil\u2019s seed\nbank, and it\u2019s due to dormant seeds that are resting in the soil. Every year a percentage\nof those seeds lose their dormancy and germinate, leaving you wondering in frustration\nwhether the weeding will ever end. (It won\u2019t.)\nReview questions\n1. What type of reproduction results in genetic diversity among seeds produced on the same\nplant?\n2. Distinguish between mechanisms causing dispersion in time vs. dispersion in space.\n3. What part(s) of the seed provide nutrition? Protection? 286 | 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\nGermination\nGermination is the reactivation of the seed\u2019s metabolism and the restoration of embryo\ngrowth. There are two main reasons why seeds don\u2019t germinate:\n1. They could still be quiescent because favorable external conditions do not yet exist.\nIn particular, the environment could be too dry or too cold, or the oxygen levels\ncould be too low to support embryo growth.\n2. They could be dormant \u2014 the characteristic that allows seeds to disperse in time.\nExternal conditions\nThe external conditions required for germination to occur are:\n\u2022 Water\n\u2022 Oxygen\n\u2022 Temperature\n\u2022 Light (for some small or fine seeds, like lettuce)\nLooking at these external conditions more closely:\nMoist conditions allow the seed to imbibe water. Seeds are typically very dry \u2014\nsomewhere in the 8\u201315% relative humidity range \u2014 so they will readily take up moisture\nfrom damp soil. Water moves through the pericarp and seed coat into cells and leads to\nreactivation of the metabolic processes. The seed\u2019s nutritive reserves are metabolized for\nthe embryonic cells to divide, enlarge, and differentiate.\nThe breakdown of nutrient reserves to form energy for plant growth is called respiration,\nand it requires oxygen. The seed must have oxygen to respire. If you keep seeds in\nan oxygen-depleted atmosphere, they will not germinate. One all-too-common type of\noxygen-depleted environment in which seeds are sometimes placed is waterlogged soil. If\nyou over-water newly planted seeds, the water will keep oxygen from reaching the seeds,\nand although the seeds will imbibe water and swell as if everything is going well, they will\nnot germinate, and will likely rot because there is not enough oxygen available to sustain\nrespiration. Waterlogged soil also encourages growth of bacterial and fungal organisms\nthat can infect and decompose the seed.\nDepending on the species, seeds have various temperature requirements for 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY | 287\ngermination. Some spring flowers will germinate when soil temperatures are quite cool,\neven below 50\u00baF, while most of the seeds we plant in our gardens prefer temperatures in\nthe 50\u201370\u00baF range. Again, respiration is the reason. Molecules move around faster when\nthey are warmer, and this movement encourages the chemical reactions required for\nrespiration. If the seeds are cold and the molecules aren\u2019t moving around, the seeds won\u2019t\ngerminate.\nIf light is required for seed germination, the species is said to be positively photoblastic.\nThis characteristic allows the seed to remain dormant when buried deep underground,\nbut to germinate when brought to the surface. As you might imagine, weeds that are\nsuccessful in annually-tilled soils may be positively photoblastic. They remain dormant\nuntil tillage brings them to the soil surface.\nA note about respiration\nRespiration refers to the set of reactions that take place in the plant cell to convert\nchemical energy stored in molecules into a form of energy that can be readily used by\nthe cell to power other chemical reactions. Respiration converts the starch stored in the\nendosperm or cotyledon into ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) (optional reading), which is\nused in the apical meristems and the radical of the embryo to fuel cell division and the\nproduction of new cells.\nGlucose molecule. Public domain.\nStarch is made up of a chain of glucose subunits. Glucose, shown in the three-dimensional 288 | 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\nmodel above, is a simple sugar that is made up of 6 carbon atoms, 6 oxygen atoms, and 12\nhydrogen atoms. The shorthand formula for glucose is C H O . The shorthand formula\n6 12 6\nfor starch is [C H O ]n, where the \u201cn\u201d indicates that there are \u201cn\u201d glucose molecules that,\n6 12 6\nwhen linked together, make up a starch molecule.\nWhen we put a quiescent, but not dormant, seed in the ground and it has access to\nappropriate moisture, warmth, and oxygen (and light if positively photoblastic), it begins\nto respire. Enzymes are secreted by the cotyledon and, depending on the species, by\nother specialized cells surrounding the cotyledon and endosperm, which break down the\nstored starch into its glucose subunits. It is important that the starch be broken down to\nglucose because glucose is a sugar that is physically small enough to pass through the\nsemipermeable cell membrane; starch is too large to get through. Starch can\u2019t be moved\nfrom cell to cell, but glucose can. Starch can be stored in cotyledon or endosperm cells\nand be broken down to glucose, and that glucose then moves into the actively dividing\nmeristem cells.\nCellular respiration. Emily Tepe\nOnce in the cell cytoplasm, the glucose is broken in half by a process called glycolysis\nto form a 3-carbon compound known as pyruvate. Pyruvate first reacts with a carrier 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY | 289\nmolecule and then moves into the mitochondria \u2014 the powerhouse organelles in the cell\n\u2014 where it is further metabolized to yield high-energy molecules of ATP. The processes in\nthe mitochondria require the presence of oxygen. The ATP moves out of the mitochondria\nand to the parts of the cells where chemical reactions are taking place that need energy.\nStarch stored in the seed is a form of stored energy composed of glucose. Glucose is a\ntransportable form of chemical energy that can move through cell membranes, so it helps\nsurround the seed with chemical energy. Pyruvate is a compound formed from glucose\nthat can move into the mitochondria and be broken down to yield ATP. ATP leaves the\nmitochondria and provides the cell with the energy needed for a wide range of chemical\nreactions.\nThe inputs for respiration are glucose and oxygen. Respiration converts the energy stored\nin the glucose into ATP that will power reactions throughout the cell. Carbon dioxide and\nwater are the two waste products.\nSeeds also store lipids and protein in the cotyledons. These too can be broken down\nduring respiration. The lipids are first biochemically deconstructed into their components:\nglycerol and fatty acids. The glycerol molecule is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and\noxygen \u2014 so it can also be converted to pyruvate and heads into the mitochondria for\nconversion to ATP. The fatty acids take a different biochemical route, but still end up\nyielding ATP. Protein respiration is even more complicated, and yields nitrogen-containing\nbuilding blocks of protein and cells called amino acids that are used in construction of\nother molecules in the cell. Stored protein in the seed is better at providing amino acid\nbuilding blocks than it is in providing ATP to energize the cell. Protein can provide energy\nif necessary, but starch and lipid are more efficient energy storage molecules.\nStoring seeds\nSince germinating seeds require oxygen, moisture, and warmth, you can intentionally\nrestrict germination by limiting one or more of these conditions. Why restrict germination?\nOne reason is to store and save seeds for long periods of time. The most common method\nfor storing seeds is to ensure that they remain dry. If you dry seeds in the sun on a low-\nhumidity Minnesota day, you will get the seeds down to around 10% moisture, which\nis great for storage. (Don\u2019t bake them in the oven; too much heat will kill the embryo.)\nAt a moisture level of 10% or lower you can put them into a glass jar with a tight lid\nand put them on a shelf for a few years of storage. To store them longer, you can put\nthem in your freezer, which of course means that you have drastically reduced the heat\nin the seed, which will stall respiration even further and extend the life of the seed. In 290 | 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\nextreme situations, such as that maintained at the National Seed Storage Laboratory in\nFort Collins, Colorado, seeds are dried and placed in oxygen-depleted conditions and\nstored in a freezer, or put in vials and suspended in the vapor over liquid nitrogen for\nstorage at about -150\u00baC.\nFor home storage of most garden seeds, get them dry, put them in a tightly lidded glass\njar, and, to make them to last 5\u201310 years, put the jar in the freezer. To dry small amounts\nof seeds, you can use a home food dehydrator set on a very low temperature. Don\u2019t put\nyour seeds in the refrigerator unless you have them very tightly sealed in an air-proof\ncontainer, because refrigerators are damp. A refrigerator is a great place to store popcorn,\nbecause the humidity ensures that the kernels have enough moisture to pop strongly, but\nit\u2019s a poor environment for seed storage.\nDormancy\nThe second reason seeds resist germination is dormancy. Dormancy is when the seeds do\nnot germinate, even though conditions for germination are favorable. Something about\nthe seed prevents germination. Barriers to germination could include:\n1. Barriers in the protective covering:\n\u25e6 A seed coat, or pericarp, that is impermeable to water or oxygen.\n\u25e6 Compounds that act as germination inhibitors that are embedded within the\nseed coat.\n2. Barriers in the embryo:\n\u25e6 Physiological immaturity of embryo \u2014 the embryo is initially immature and\nrequires a period of cool temperatures or alternating warm and cool\ntemperatures to fully mature.\n\u25e6 Endodormancy in temperate plants \u2014 internal biochemical processes must be\nmet in the seed before germination can begin. Endo-dormancy is the first stage\nof dormancy for many seeds from plants grown in temperate environments like\nMinnesota. Once the internal biochemical processes are met, the seed usually\ngoes into eco-dormancy.\n\u25e6 Ecodormancy \u2014 external factors are not optimal for germination. This is often\ndue to temperatures being too cold, or to amounts of water not sufficient for\ngermination. 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY | 291\nKentucky coffee tree seeds. Laura Irish\nThe ways in which horticulturists overcome seed dormancy depend on the type of\ndormancy. For seeds with impermeable seed coat, such as the Kentucky coffeetree\n(Gymnocladus dioicus) seen above, a technique called scarification is used. Sandpaper is\nused to break through the seed coat until the white cotyledon is visible. Under warm,\nmoist conditions, these seeds will germinate. To germinate a large amount of seed, there\nare other ways to break the seed coat, such as using acid to \u201cetch\u201d holes in the seed coat\nto allow for water imbibition. 292 | 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY\nStratifying Amalanchier seeds. Laura Irish\nIn the case of endodormancy, we usually have to be patient. Seeds are placed in a cool\n(38\u201342\u00baF) place under moist conditions. This process is called stratification. Depending\non the plant species, stratification can take from 2 weeks to almost a year. It is as easy as\nputting seeds in a sealable plastic container or bag with moist media, and placing them\ninto a refrigerator.\nDormancy is a great strategy for enhancing a plant\u2019s survival potential because\ngermination is delayed until a later time when environmental conditions are more 9.2 SEED PHYSIOLOGY | 293\nfavorable. However, for horticulturists who prefer that a seed germinate as quickly as\npossible after being planted, dormancy is a nuisance. One of a horticulturist\u2019s important\nskills is to recognize dormancy, identify the dormancy mechanism, and take steps to\novercome the inhibition so that plants can grow predictably from seed when planted.\nReview questions:\n1. What external factors are required for germination?\n2. Outline the process through which the seed\u2019s embryo receives useful energy from the starch\nstored in the cotyledon or endosperm.\n3.

CHAPTER 10: GRAFTING | 297\nCHAPTER 10: GRAFTING\nSome plants do not produce sufficient seed or lack competency to form adventitious\nroots by making cuttings, and we are left with grafting as a method of choice for asexual\npropagation. Grafting is the cloning of a scion or bud onto a rootstock, but adds the\npossibility of manipulating shoot properties through the choice of rootstock.\nOther plants clone themselves naturally and may use special storage organs to help with\nperenniation. These can develop offsets, pups, and other clonal storage organs. The plant\npropagator can also induce these tissues to form more propagules. Excellent examples\ninclude bulbs, corms, and rhizomes.\nIn this research orchard,\ngrafted apple trees are\ntested for suitability.\nPhoto by UMN\nDepartment of\nHorticultural Science.\nLearning objectives 298 | CHAPTER 10: GRAFTING\n\u2022 Understand why plants are grafted or budded and the techniques used for specific\noutcomes.\n\u2022 Describe how a graft union heals.\n\u2022 Compare and contrast how a plant responds to wounding versus healing a graft union.\n\u2022 Characterize the differences between bulbs and other storage organs.\n\u2022 Describe techniques for propagating plants with different clonal strategies from storage\norgans. 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS | 299\n10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain why plants are grafted or budded and the techniques employed for specific uses.\n\u2022 Describe how a graft union heals.\n\u2022 Compare and contrast how a plant responds to wounding versus healing a graft union.\nGrafting\nGrafting is the art and science of connecting two pieces of living plant tissue together\nin such a manner that they will unite and subsequently grow and develop into one\ncomposite plant. The union of these two different plant materials via grafting creates a\nchimera, \u2014 two different plant genotypes growing together in the same plant. The roots\nof an apple tree in a commercial orchard, for instance, likely came from a plant with a\ngenotype that induces dwarfing of the tree. The picture below shows the swelling of the\ngraft union a few inches above the soil surface. 300 | 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\nGrafted apple tree. Emily Tepe\nGrafting is means of asexual reproduction, which is vegetative propagation. The scions\nare exact genetic copies, and are sometimes called clones or clonal propagation. Although\nthe graft can combine two different plant types, species, or even genera between the scion\nand rootstock, the scion material being propagated is an exact genetic copy of the parent\nplant that donates the vegetative parts used in the graft. Usually the scion or bud and\nrootstock are the same species, because this favors compatibility and successful grafting.\nThe rootstock can thus be from mixed types, but the scion is from the same plant type for\nclonal propagation.\nThe shoot of a grafted apple tree, for example, comes from a plant with great-tasting\napples, while the rootstock may not produce great apples. The root and shoot were\ngrafted together and the tree grows as one plant, but with two genotypes: the roots have\none genotype \u2014 one set of genes \u2014 and the shoot another, yet they are all growing as\none plant. That\u2019s a chimera.\nWhen a horticulturist makes a graft, as in the apple trees above, one genotype of the 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS | 301\ntree species is typically used for the above-ground part of the plant, called the scion,\nand another for the below-ground portion, called the rootstock. A grafted plant has a\nscion growing on a rootstock, and the scion and rootstocks have different genotypes. In\nmany grafting situations the scion and rootstock are of similar diameter, uniting the two\ngenotypes where the graft union is made.\nGrafting is a very old horticultural technique; there are historic records of horticulturists\ngrafting olives 2,000 years ago. They may not have known how the cells divided and\nhealed, but they knew how and why to graft.\nReasons to graft\nWhile grafting is a valuable vegetative propagation technique, not all plants are easily\ngrafted. For those that do respond well to grafting, there are different reasons for\nemploying the technique.\nCreate unique, commercially desirable ornamentals\nGrafted cactus. hmerinomx.

Genotypes don\u2019t\nroot successfully from cuttings, but can be grafted onto a rootstock grown from seeds\nof less desirable types. The seedlings provide great rootstocks, and the shoot that has\nbeen grafted onto this rootstock expresses the highly desirable plant type.

In commercial apple\norchards, some trees might be of cultivars that are no longer popular. Instead of pulling\nout these trees and planting young trees of a new cultivar, which difficult and expensive,\nnew scions can be grafted from popular cultivars onto older trees after cutting those trees 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS | 305\nback to stumps. This is called cleft grafting or, more commonly, \u201ctopworking.\u201d By putting\nthe new scion on an established rootstock, an orchard will come back into production\nmuch sooner than if new, young trees were planted.\nProduce trees with specialized forms\nWeeping flowering tree. Janine and Jim Eden. CC BY 2.0\nIn the case of some flowering trees, like cherry and dogwood, propagators graft a\nweeping-type scion (one that looks like an umbrella rather than growing upright) onto a\n3\u2032 to 5\u2032 standard rootstock. The \u201cweeping\u201d form has branches that arch downward rather\nthan upright. The graft union is far above the ground rather than down by the soil, as is\ntypically the case with grafted maple, spruce, and fruit trees. These weeping-habit trees\nare more prone to poor wound healing and regrowth of the rootstock at the point of the\ngraft union.\nRepair damaged plants\nThe idea here is to create a graft that re-unites the cambium in the tree trunk after being\nsevered by a chewing rodent or mechanical damage such as might be dished out by an\nindiscriminately piloted weed whipper. The graft is inserted into a point below the damage\nand runs to a point above the damage. This grafting operation is particularly important\nwhen the tree is girdled or nearly girdled (the cambium is damaged all the way around the 306 | 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\ntrunk) because otherwise the tree will die. This technique is called bridge grafting and\ncan be quite successful in saving a tree. The picture is from Maple Valley Orchards where\nthey bridged grafted several trees to save them from dying. You can see how the cambium\nand phloem have both been disrupted.\nBridge graft. John Kring.

For most plant material that is grafted commercially, such as apple or peach\ntrees, there is no other way to preserve the desired scion cultivar.\nGrafting is an art. People who have grafted a lot of plant material understand aspects\nof their plants that will increase success, such as choosing compatible genotypes and\nmatching stem diameters. Experienced grafters also know the timing of growth stages to\nincrease grafting success. For example, whip and tongue grafts are done when both the\nrootstock and scion are dormant. In contrast, t-budding is done in August when the bark\nis \u201cslipping\u201d and the buds themselves are newly formed. 308 | 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\nSo why don\u2019t grafts heal and produce new plants? Some of the reasons include:\n\u2022 The type of plant is not conducive to grafting. Dicots and gymnosperms both have\ncambium encircling the stems, so aligning is possible. Monocot stems have cambium\nscattered around the stem, so aligning cambia between two plants is basically\nimpossible.\n\u2022 While the same species are often compatible and a successful graft results, as the\nrelatedness decreases between the scion and rootstock, for example with different\ngenera, grafting success is significantly reduced.\n\u2022 Time of year and growing season both make a difference in graft success. Grafting\nsuccess is more likely when the cambium is actively growing, but leaf growth is\nminimal, because water loss is at a minimum.\n\u2022 The environment under which the grafts are healing, including temperature and\nhumidity, is important. Light is less important.\n\u2022 Technique is VERY important. If there is poor cambial contact, the callus bridge does\nnot form, no vascular tissue is produced, and the grafted plant does not grow.\nWhile most reasons to graft relate to desirable characteristics of the scion, there are\nsituations in which the rootstock genotype or characteristics are also important. For\nexample, apple and grape rootstocks are critical for correct plant form and disease\nresistance. Outside of those and perhaps a few other exceptions, the point of grafting is\nto propagate the scion.\nAgain, because of the expertise, time, and expense required for grafting, grafting is used\nonly if it\u2019s not possible to propagate a plant by other easier and cheaper methods, like\nplanting seeds or taking cuttings. If a plant roots easily, and doesn\u2019t require special\nrootstock characteristics like dwarfing or resistance to diseases and insects, there is no\nneed for a graft.\nTypes of grafting and budding\nTechniques for grafting have different names and are based on the type of plant material\navailable and its stage of growth. Here are a few of the grafting or budding methods and\nwhen they are used. 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS | 309\nBridge grafting\nBridge grafting is used to repair damage to tree trunks. Smaller-size woody branches are\nused to reconnect the vascular tissues in the trunk so that water can flow up the trunk and\nsugars can flow down. These branches are the conduits.\nWhip and tongue grafting\nWatch this short video for a demonstration of whip and tongue grafting (3:57)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1407#oembed-3\nWhip-and-tongue grafting. Anonymous. Public domain.\nThe whip and tongue graft is used when the rootstock and scion are the same size. If you\nhave two pieces of woody plant material that are the same size in diameter, it is fairly easy 310 | 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\nto line up the cambium of each piece and slip the two pieces together. The video linked\nabove shows the steps of this type of grafting, including the cuts that need to be made,\nhow to tie the two pieces together, and the finishing step of reducing water loss at the\ngraft union by applying a wax. For additional pictures and an explanation of the entire\nmethod, Texas A&M has an excellent short article with more information.\nApproach graft\nApproach graft. Gmihail. CC BY-SA 3.0 RS\nIn approach grafting, the scion is often smaller than the rootstock. As the name indicates, 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS | 311\nthe two plant materials are brought close together, the cambiums of both are aligned, and\nthey are allowed to grow together. Often, in plant propagation, we have done approach\ngrafting by using potato as the rootstock and tomato as the scion (remember that these\ntwo plants are closely related). Using the same methodology described above, the tomato\nand potato plants are potted into the same pot, a thin slice is taken off each stem to reveal\nthe cambium, and the stems are tied together. When the graft heals, the plant on the top\nwill produce tomatoes, and the one on the bottom will produce potato tubers that can be\nharvested at the end of the season.

CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 312 | 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\nCleft graft diagram. Giancarlodessi. CC BY-SA 3.0\nCleft grafting is a technique which allows the union of a rootstock that is much larger in\nsize than the scion. It is conducted in late winter, when both the rootstock and the scion\nare dormant. Common applications for cleft grafting include changing the variety of an\nexisting orchard (also called topworking), adding a branch of an untested scion cultivar to\nan existing tree for observation, or repairing a tree that may have had a branch broken off\nby storm damage or fruit overloading. The technique can also be used for producing one\ntree with multiple cultivars on it. Have you ever read about an apple tree with 10 different\ntypes of apples on it?

You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1407#oembed-6\nWhat happens when you graft?\nFirst, recall what happens when you do a stem cutting:\n\u2022 The cells along the cut surface are sliced open, die, and become necrotic (dead)\ntissue.\n\u2022 The surviving cells one layer in from the cut (parenchyma cells in the cortex) respond 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS | 317\nto the wound. There are two responses:\n\u25e6 The cells rapidly exude compounds like suberin (gummy substance) to protect\nthe plant from excess water loss and invasion by diseases and insects.\n\u25e6 The cells are stimulated to divide and produce a mass of new cells to cover and\nprotect the wound. The mass of new cells is called callus. This response takes\nquite a bit more time (like years) compared to the time required to exude\nsuberin (hours).\nFrom the plant\u2019s point of view, the slicing that happens when making a graft is similar\nto the slicing that happens when you make an incision in the stem for a cutting. You\nare still slicing open cells, but because the rootstock and scion are in close contact, the\nenvironment around the cut ends is quite different from a cutting in which the wound\nis exposed to the environment. With a graft you have two stems that are held in close\nproximity and therefore are more protected than the open wound of a cutting.\n\u2022 Within a few days, cell division starts and a callus of undifferentiated cells forms. The\ncallus cells will continue to differentiate by developing cells with specialized form and\nfunction maturation of new cambium, xylem and phloem.\n\u25e6 The callus originates from parenchyma cells in the cortex, pith, or vascular\nbundles. The origin depends on the species.\n\u25e6 The callus grows from both the scion and rootstock.\n\u2022 Callus from the rootstock and scion grow together to form a callus bridge.\n\u2022 The parenchyma cells in the callus bridge that lie between the cambium of the\nrootstock and the scion differentiate into cambium cells.\n\u25e6 Additional parenchyma cells on either side of the cambium may differentiate\ninto xylem and phloem until a connection among xylem, cambium, and phloem\nhas been formed across the callus bridge.\n\u2022 Once these links are formed, the cambium begins to initiate new xylem and phloem.\n\u2022 Differentiation of the xylem and phloem is faster where cambium layers are closely\naligned.\nAgain, it is important when grafting to get good cambium-to-cambium alignment between\nscion and rootstock. This will promote development of cambium cells that will\ndifferentiate into the callus bridge. The callus bridge is what joins the scion and rootstock.\nIf your technique has poor cambial alignment, or gaps between scion and rootstock at the\ngraft junction, the cell-to-cell linkage will not happen, or it will only happen weakly, and\nthe graft will fail because there is no new xylem and phloem production, and therefore 318 | 10.1 GRAFTS AND WOUNDS\nno water or sugar transport pathways. In addition to this being a linkage of plumbing so\nthat water and sugars flow, it is also a structural linkage that gives the plant strength and\nrigidity across the graft union.\nFive requirements for making a\nsuccessful graft\n1. The rootstock and scion must be compatible. Even if they\nare from the same species, some scions won\u2019t graft on to\nsome rootstocks.\n2. The cambial layers of the rootstock and scion must be\nclosely aligned and in contact.\n3. The graft must be done at the appropriate time of year.\nThe buds, whether grafting whole stems or just the buds\nthemselves, must be dormant. In temperate latitudes,\ngrafting is typically done in winter when rootstock is also\ndormant, but budding is done late in the growing season\nwhen buds are formed, but dormant, and the bark is\n\u201cslipping\u201d so that a T-shaped cut in the bark can be opened\ninto a pocket for the bud (image on the right).\n4. Grafts must be protected from drying.\n5. The grafted plant must receive proper post-graft care such\nas removing sprouts and suckers that emerge from the\nrootstock and might be mistaken for scion, and pruning or\ntraining the scion so that it develops the appropriate plant\nform.\nT-budding.

Other plants may grow and store\ntheir nodes under water in a pond or stream. Many orchid species live in trees and are\ncalled epiphytes. The specialized storage organs have several roles which allow them to\nperenniate and colonize. This short video will introduce some of the special organs that\nyou are likely already familiar with (3:27).\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1427#oembed-1 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS | 321\nThese organs store carbohydrates that can be used for rapid growth when favorable\nconditions return. They protect the nodes from injury from herbivory and injury (frost and\nfreeze), and are a natural form of cloning by producing new daughter plants away from\nthe mother plant. The plant propagator uses techniques that take advantage of these\nnatural processes and can therefore rapidly increase the number of plants.\nBulbs\nThe onion and lily family (Liliaceae; monocots) are typical examples of bulb-producing\nherbaceous perennials. The bulbs are subterranean, which prevents them from predation\nand weather conditions. Bulbs consist of a highly condensed stem (with nodes and\ninternodes) and adventitious roots that form along the basal plate. Two main types of\nbulbs include imbricate and tunicate. Imbricate bulbs, typical of some lily species, consist\nof scales, as shown in the photo below. Scales are specialized leaves that form radially\naround the meristem. During the growing season, leaves and a stem emerge from the\nsoil from the center of the plant, where the apical meristem is located. These above-\nground leaves are able to photosynthesize. The central meristem converts to a floral\nmeristem where flowers are produced. New lateral bulblets form from the meristem in\naxils underground, allowing the plant to colonize and perenniate. In some cases, the\nmain bulb may not continue to grow as the meristem has converted to flowering. The\nnew bulbelts can be removed to produce new daughter plants. The plant propagator can\nremove scales from the bulb and create a new daughter plant from each. This scaling\ntechnique is highly effective, though it may take several years for the new plantlet to\nflower again. 322 | 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS\nThe common Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) has an imbricate bulb structure. Gardening Solutions.\nCC BY-NC 2.0\nTunicate bulbs (below), or those with paper coverings, are exemplified by onions, tulips,\nand garlic. Specialized leaves make up the mass of the storage organ for the plant and\nform concentric rings around the meristem. Typically, when we cut an onion from the\ntip through the root end, we can see the layers of leaves (the parts that we eat) and\nthen stem at the bottom. We know it is a stem because there are nodes and internodes.\nWhen cooking, we typically discard the stem, basal plate, and adventitious roots. To view\nthe different structures of a bulb during the growing season, look in particular at green\nonions, scallions, and leeks. Newer leaves form in the interior of the bulb (the apical\nmeristem is in the middle) and the papery skin is the oldest layer formed. From the middle 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS | 323\nof the bulb, leaves emerge to photosynthesize when the conditions are right, and the\nfloral meristem emerges from the middle. Lateral tunicate bulblets may form inside the\nmain bulb, or along the exterior at the basal plate, especially if there is an injury. Scooping\nthe basal plate is one way to induce bulblet formation. The basal plate can also be scored\nto have a similar effect.\nLateral tunicate bulblets on Albuca bracteata. CloveMill. CC BY-SA 4.0 324 | 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS\nGarlic is an example of a tunicate bulb. Scouse Smurf. CC BY-ND 2.0\nTo propagate a tunicate bulb, it can be sectioned in many pieces by cutting from top to\nbottom through the basal plate. The sections are allowed to dry for a few days, treated\nwith a fungicide, and then planted in a cold frame or other suitable system to induce bulb\nformation and plant regeneration. It may take several seasons for the bulbs to develop\na suitable size for flowering. When doing any sectioning, scaling, scoring, or scooping the\ntools should be cleaned between cuts, or at the very least between bulbs, to prevent\nthe spread of disease. Alcohol is suitable for killing microbes and for cleaning the cutting\nsurface and fingers. 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS | 325\nBulbils on Allium vineale v. vineale. Dr Mary\nGillham Archive Project. CC BY 2.0\nLiliaceae is unique in that bulb-like organs may also form above ground. In this family,\nbulbils, shown in the photo above, are formed in the leaf axils above ground or in some\nflowers. Bulbils are clonal (asexual) propagation and not formed through pollination.\nWhen the lily\u2019s flower stalk dies, it falls to the ground and the bulbils are scattered away\nfrom the mother plant. This colonization strategy is highly effective and can be very weedy\nfor the gardener. Mature or \u201cripe\u201d bulbils can be removed from the plant and potted as\nsoon as they easily detach. Alternatively they can \u201cself sow\u201d and be moved the following\nspring.\nSome bulbs develop contractile roots that pull the bulbs into the soil. As bulbs grow each\nyear, they would logically move closer to the surface, putting them at risk. The contractile\nroots are able to get the bulb to the proper depth after a growing season. 326 | 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS\nCorms\nGiant elephant ear corm. Matthew Clark\nLike bulbs, corms are underground storage structures that have evolved in some plants.\nCorms are a storage unit made of compressed stems, unlike the leaves that provide the\nstorage function in bulbs. Because they are stems, corms have nodes, internodes, and\nmeristems just like above-ground stems. The roots of corms are adventitious and develop\nfrom a basal plate and nodes. Corms may be short-lived in herbaceous perennials like\nGladiolus, where a new corm is replacing itself regularly; in tropical climates, taro (Alocasia)\nmay grow for several years with the same corm structure. The giant elephant ear plant\nabove shows a corm structure. Corms reproduce asexually through cormels, akin to the\nbulblets produced by bulbs. Watch this short video (0:47) to see a closeup of this corm. 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS | 327\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Matthew\nClark\nCorms can be induced to produce cormels by removing the apical bud, which removes\ndominance and stimulates new growth at the nodes. This is generally not necessary, as\nmany corm-producing plants naturally increase with new corms annually. In the photo\nabove, the corm on the left shows the aggressive nature of colonization. The oldest corm\nat the bottom is being replaced by the actively growing corm attached above it. We can\nalso see two cormels that have formed (red arrows). Eventually the lower, older corm\nwill dessicate and decompose. This is a great example of why some geophytes have\ncontractile roots, for in one growing season the newest cormel could grow above the soil\nsurface. 328 | 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS\nRhizomes\nRhizomes are also underground stems. The Canna lily (below) produces large rhizomes\neach year. Notice how it looks a lot like ginger \u201croot;\u201d the two plants are in the same\nfamily. As stems, they have nodes that produce shoots and they have adventitious roots.\nRhizomes typically grow horizontally at or near the soil surface. Some grasses use\nrhizomes to help with rapid colonization from the crown. Rhizomes can be divided into\nmany pieces as a way to produce multiple clonal propagules.\nCanna lily rhizome. Matthew Clark\nTubers\nPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the typical example of a common plant that uses a tuber\nfor storage and propagation. Tubers are another example of an underground stem, with 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS | 329\nnodes and internodes. The nodes may not be obvious when the potato is fresh from the\ngrocery store, but in storage the potato may grow \u201ceyes\u201d which are new shoots that are\ngrowing from the once dormant nodes. Most people have seen this in their pantry or\non the kitchen counter. To plant potatoes, the farmer cuts up pieces of the last year\u2019s\npotatoes so there are enough carbohydrates and nodes for a new plant to emerge from\nthe soil.\nRoots\nWe\u2019ve already learned that roots play an important role in storing nutrients for plants.\nBiennial plants like carrots, parsnip, and beets have fleshy roots which help them\noverwinter. These are not easy to propagate into new plants and typically are grown from\nseed. Horseradish and some poppy plants, however, can easily be propagated from root\ncuttings. A common example of a tuberous root is the sweet potato (looks like a tuber,\nfunctions like a root). The common garden radish (Raphanus sativus) may seem like a root,\nbut close investigation reveals that it is mostly the swollen hypocotyl (image below).\nRadish hypocotyls in 4 stages of growth. Matthew Clark 330 | 10.2 UNIQUE STORAGE ORGANS\nOther methods of colonization\nCrowns\nHosta plants are common examples of herbaceous perennials that are excellent at\ncolonizing through an underground crown. The underground stem grows radially each\nyear. New shoots can be removed, as shown below. Notice the adventitious roots. Many\nperennial grasses, asparagus, and other herbaceous perennial plants can be divided into\nmultiple new plants, taking advantage of this colonization strategy. Offshoots (sometimes\ncalled pups) can be removed from the mother plant and replanted elsewhere.\nAgave plants \u2013 which are used to produce tequila \u2013 are clonally reproduced this way, as\nseed production results in new genetic recombinations that are different from the mother\nplants. Clonal propagation ensures reproducibility for uniform forms and consistent\ntequila production.

To\nmaintain growth, plants monitor signals of light, temperature, humidity, wind, and soil\nwater availability; these signals inform the plant on how to modify water movement and\ngas exchange, which also affect photosynthesis.

The stomata open\nto allow oxygen (as a waste product of photosynthesis) to escape the leaf, and carbon\ndioxide (donor of the carbon atoms that are the building blocks of the sugar molecules\nassembled during photosynthesis) to enter. When these stomata are open, water vapor\nexits. We often refer to stomata as associated with gas exchange in the leaves because\nof the movement of these three gasses: oxygen (out), carbon dioxide (in), and water vapor\n(out).\nEvapotranspiration (often just called transpiration) refers to the movement of water in\nthe plant from root to stem to leaf and out through the stomata to the atmosphere. This\nisn\u2019t just a dribble of water. An acre of corn will transpire about 3,000\u20134,000 gallons of\nwater each day, and a large oak tree can transpire 40,000 gallons each year. 340 | 11.1 PLANTS AND WATER\nDiagram of evapotranspiration. Sheng-Yang He. CC BY-SA 4.0\nAs illustrated above, a stream of water is constantly moving up from the roots and out of\nthe plant. Note the tissues and cells that are involved, and recall that water moves from\nthe soil through the epidermis and cortex toward the xylem in the vascular bundle in one\nof two ways, symplastically or apoplastically. Symplastic means that water and minerals\nmove interior to the cell membrane, or through cells, while apoplastic water moves\naround the cell membrane in the space outside the cell. Symplastic movement starts with\nwater entering the epidermis cells through root hairs and then continuing from cell to cell\nthrough the cortex to the xylem in the vascular bundle. Entry of symplastic water into the\nroot is regulated by the cell membrane of the root hair. Apoplastic movement of water\noccurs between the cells. This movement is unregulated until the water hits the cutin\nbarrier formed by the Casparian Strip around the innermost layer of cortex cells in roots\nThe Casparian strip blocks apoplastic water movement. The apoplastic water must then\nmove symplastically into the cortex cells through the cell membrane, which controls the\nentry of water and minerals. From here, the water moves from cell to cell to the xylem,\nand then is pulled up the plant as described below.\nThe rate of evapotranspiration depends on environmental factors such as:\nLight \u2014 Due to the occurrence of photosynthesis, plants transpire more rapidly in the 11.1 PLANTS AND WATER | 341\nlight than in the dark. The guard cells, part of the stomata, are stimulated to swell, opening\nthe stomata in the light of the day.\nTemperature \u2014 As temperatures rise, water evaporates out of the leaves more readily.\nOn hot summer days, leaves thus have a tendency to wilt due to lack of water in the soil\nand to the increased rate of transpiration.\nHumidity \u2014 When the air around the leaf is drier, there is greater movement of water\nvapor out of the leaf than if the air around the leaf is saturated with water.\nWind \u2014 A breeze will clear water vapor away from the surface of the leaf, leaving the\nhumidity on the leaf surface low and increasing the rate of transpiration.\nSoil water availability \u2014 The water that is transpired must come from somewhere, and\nthat somewhere is the soil. When the roots can\u2019t absorb enough water to keep up with\nthe evapotranspiration demand, the leaves lose more water than they can replace. Water\npressure inside the cells, called turgor pressure, is reduced because some water is pulled\nout of the cells to satisfy the demand from evaporation. This loss of turgor pressure\nrelaxes the guard cells, causing the closure of the stomata, which shuts off a major avenue\nfor gas exchange and the main channel for evaporation. This is a key strategy used by\nplants for managing stress from insufficient water. If the loss of turgor is severe, the\nplants will temporarily wilt. When the evapotranspiration demand is reduced through a\nchange in environmental conditions, or when water supply increases, the cells again fill\nwith water, turgor is reestablished, the stomata reopen, and the plant leaves recover from\ntheir temporary wilting. You have likely seen this happen when you have forgotten to\nwater a house plant. So long as you water it soon enough, the plant regains turgor and\nsurvives the neglect.\nReview questions\n1. What is turgor pressure and how do leaves compensate when cells begin to lose turgor?\n2. How can wind result in low turgor pressure? 342 | 11.1 PLANTS AND WATER\n3. What are three gasses that move through the leaf stomata? What is their involvement in\nplant function?\nMechanisms of water movement in plants\nHow does water move from the soil to root to stem to leaf and out to the atmosphere?\nThis is a more complex question than it may first appear. Unlike animals, plants do not\nhave a heart to pump water from roots to leaves. There is a push explanation and a pull\nexplanation.\nGuttation. Noah Elhardt. Public domain\nPush explanation\nWater pressure (turgor) in the root cells during the night or during cloudy days can\npush water and dissolved materials up into the stem. This root pressure is the cause of 11.1 PLANTS AND WATER | 343\nguttation, the dew-like drops of water that are forced out of leaves. This same pressure\nis the force driving sap up the trunk of sugar maples in the spring. One problem with\nthis mechanism is that, at most, root pressure can move water upwards only about 60\nfeet, and this only happens at night and when it is cloudy, and it only happens in some\nplants, but not in them all. So the push explanation has many limitations that make it\nunsatisfactory as a general theory for water movement up the xylem. How does water get\nto the top of a plant when it is sunny? And how does it make its way to the top of tall\nplants?\nPull explanation\nWatch this video about transpiration (2:57)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

When\nwater molecules are near one other, the negative region of one molecule is attracted to\nthe positive region of another. This attraction is called a hydrogen bond. This type of\nbond is weak compared to covalent bonds, where molecules share electrons, but when\nthere are lots of hydrogen bonds holding these water molecules together, this type of\nchemical bonding is quite tenacious. 344 | 11.1 PLANTS AND WATER\nCohesion/adhesion. FeltyRacketeer6. CC BY-SA 4.0\nWhen water is held in a very small tube, such as an xylem vessel (above), the cohesion\namong water molecules due to the hydrogen bonds is very strong \u2014 strong enough to\nhold the column of water together very tightly over long distances, like from the root\nthrough the stem and into the leaf. Although an individual bond is weak, there are so\nmany that a column has enormous tensile strength.\nWater is also attracted to the walls of small tubes like xylem vessels. This force of\nadhesion between the water and walls of the xylem helps hold the water in the xylem\nagainst the downward force of gravity.\nAs a water molecule moves out of the leaf xylem into the air spaces among spongy\nmesophyll cells, out the stomate, and into the atmosphere through evaporation, it creates\na void or empty space in the xylem, which is filled by the next water molecule in line. As\nthis water molecule moves forward, it exerts tension (pulls) on the cohesive column of 11.1 PLANTS AND WATER | 345\nwater that extends all the way back down to the root. As one water molecule leaves, the\nnext takes its spot, and as it moves forward in line, it pulls upward the molecules behind\nit.\nThis force of cohesion-adhesion-tension is sufficient to pull water up to the top of the\ntallest tree, and is very effective while the sun is shining, when the stomata are open and\ntranspiration is active.\nThe enormous flow of water through the plant isn\u2019t simply waste and the price the plant\npays for having stomata open for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.

Specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, because they use the energy\nfrom light to produce organic molecules with which they build their cells and store energy.\nOrganic molecules are compounds associated with living organisms that contain carbon\natoms. It was once thought that organic molecules could only be synthesized in nature by\nliving organisms through the intervention of a \u201clife force.\u201d This hypothesis was disproved\nin 1828 when urea, a simple organic compound, was synthesized in a laboratory. Since\nthat time, a major branch of chemistry, organic chemistry, has arisen to study and\nsynthesize organic molecules. In contrast to organic compounds, inorganic compounds\nwere historically defined as those lifeless minerals that are dug up from the ground.\nNote that this chemical definition of organic (containing carbon atoms) has little or no\nrelationship to the contemporary use of the word to describe a method of producing food. 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 347\nOrganic food production, by regulation, relies strictly on inputs of organic molecules that\ncome from life (like manure) and also on inorganic compounds like minerals, and eschews\nthe use of organic molecules that have been synthesized by humans.\nThe organic molecules that a plant produces must be:\n\u2022 Storable within the plant.\n\u2022 Metabolized by the plant to yield energy for use in growth, maintenance, and\nproducing other required organic molecules.\n\u2022 Reasonably compact so that enough energy can be stored for growth.\n\u2022 Transportable within the plant.\n\u2022 Stable and non-toxic to the plant.\nSince plants are photoautotrophs, they must have a mechanism for capturing energy from\nthe sun or other sources of light and using that energy to produce organic molecules with\nthe characteristics noted above. Photosynthesis is the process on which photoautotrophs\nrely to capture that light energy and to produce carbon-based organic molecules. The\ncarbon used to make these molecules comes from the carbon dioxide (CO ) in the\n2\natmosphere. Because photosynthesis removes carbon from the atmosphere and\nincorporates it into organic molecules which eventually become the plant\u2019s leaves, stems,\nroots, and fruits, photosynthesis is sometimes said to fix carbon. Fix, in this sense, means\nto secure or sequester rather than to repair.\nIf you follow the public discourse on climate change, you are aware that global warming is\naccelerated by the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere which trap and\nre-radiate sunlight and heat back to the earth. CO is one of these greenhouse gasses.\n2\nRemoval of CO from the atmosphere, for instance by planting trees that photosynthesize,\n2\nfix carbon, and store the carbon-rich product as wood, is one method of carbon\nsequestration. An emerging and increasingly popular strategy for remediating\ngreenhouse gas emissions is through the buying and selling of carbon credits, where\nindustries that discharge CO into the atmosphere purchase credits from organizations\n2\nwhose activities (such as tree planting) sequester carbon. Photosynthesis and\nsequestration of carbon by trees is one tool used to offset the industrial release of CO .\n2 348 | 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nReview questions\n1. In what sense does photosynthesis fix carbon?\n2. Where does the carbon come from that is used by photosynthesis, and where does it go\nwithin the plant?\nRed light/blue light wavelengths. Emily Tepe\nLight reaction\nLet\u2019s start with light, because that\u2019s where the plant gets the energy for photosynthesis.\nHere are some characteristics of light: 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 349\n\u2022 Light travels in waves.\n\u2022 The length of the wave is measured from one peak to the next and is called the\nwavelength, which differs for different colors of light.\nVisible spectrum. Philip Ronan. CC BY-SA 3.0\n\u2022 Within the visible wavelengths of light, the longest wavelengths are red light; outside\nthe visible range of wavelengths, even longer wavelengths include infrared radiation,\nmicrowaves, and radio waves.\n\u2022 Shorter visible wavelengths include blue and purple light, and beyond the visible\nrange even shorter wavelengths include UV light, X-rays, and Gamma rays\n\u2022 Light also has a particulate nature, and those particles are called photons.\nThe photons in light provide the energy that drives photosynthesis. This energy is used\nto incorporate carbon found in CO from the atmosphere into organic molecules and, in\n2\nparticular, into simple sugars used by the plant. The chemical formula is the same for the\ntwo types of simple sugars produced by photosynthesis: glucose and fructose: C H O .\n6 12 6\nThe equation that summarizes photosynthesis is:\nwater + carbon dioxide -> oxygen, water, and simple sugars\n12H 0 + 6CO -> 6O + 6H O + C H O\n2 2 2 2 6 12 6 350 | 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nThis balanced equation tells us that 12 molecules of water plus 6 molecules of carbon\ndioxide, in the presence of chlorophyll, accessory pigments, and light, produces 6\nmolecules of oxygen gas, returns 6 molecules of water back to the cell, and produces one\nmolecule of a simple sugar like glucose or fructose.\nTwo reactions make up photosynthesis: the Light Reaction (abbreviated LR) and the\nLight Independent Reaction (abbreviated LIR). As the names suggest, the LR requires\nlight while the LIR does not. The LR uses light energy to split water, which transforms the\nenergy from the sun into hydrogen ions and electrons. The LIR uses that energy to grab\nthe carbon from carbon dioxide and use the carbon to build simple sugars.\nLet\u2019s start with the light reaction. You\u2019ve heard of chlorophyll, and may recognize this\nmolecule as a green pigment that captures light for photosynthesis. There are two\nchlorophyll pigments in plants that are critical for absorbing light: Chlorophyll aa and\nChlorophyll bb.\nChlorophyll A & B Absorption Spectrum. byr7. CC BY 2.0\nThe graph above shows % absorbance of different wavelengths by these two chlorophylls.\nThe Y axis (the vertical one) shows the percentage of the light that is absorbed (rather\nthan reflected). High levels of absorption mean that the chlorophyll molecule uses that\nwavelength of light for energy. Low absorption means that the molecule does not use\nthat wavelength, and is thus reflected away. The X axis indicates the wavelength of light\nin nanometers (nm) (the wavelength of green light, roughly 500 nm). The bar at the 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 351\ntop represents the color of the light at the wavelength shown. The blue line is a typical\nabsorption curve for chlorophyll a, while the green line shows chlorophyll b.\nHigh absorbance at a particular wavelength means that pigment is collecting that light at\nthat wavelength to harvest energy. Low absorbance means that the plant is reflecting that\nlight back. Both chlorophyll a and b absorb blue and red light wavelengths and reflect\ngreen. Chlorophyll a has a peak in the violet and red regions and chlorophyll b in the blue\nand orange regions. Notice how their absorbance is very low in the green region. That\u2019s\nwhy we think of chlorophyll as green, and why we perceive leaves, which have chlorophyll\nas the predominant pigment, as green. Also notice that chlorophyll reflects some yellow\nwavelengths, but when the yellow and deep green wavelengths are mixed, we see the\ngreen leaf color.\nCarotenoids absorption spectrum. byr7. CC BY 2.0\nThe graph above shows the absorbance of carotenoid pigments, which are present\nthroughout the growing season. Carotenoids are called an accessory pigment in\nphotosynthesis. They assist chlorophyll in light capture and energy transfer, and\ncontribute to the regulation and moderation of excessive excitation of pigment molecules\nduring intense sunlight, including exposure to UV light. Carotenoids absorb light in the\ngreen range, but reflect in yellow and red. We don\u2019t see these pigments during the growing\nseason because they are much lower in concentration than the chlorophylls, so the green\nreflected light overwhelms the orange, and we see green. But when the chlorophyll fades\nin the fall, due to decomposition of chlorophyll, the orange can be seen in beautiful fall\nleaf colors. 352 | 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nChlorophyll a and b, as well as the accessory pigments, are found in the chloroplasts,\nwhich are membrane-bound organelles within cells. The highest concentration of\nchloroplasts is most commonly found in the palisade mesophyll cells of the leaf.\nChloroplast. Kelvinsong.

The green chlorophyll 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 353\npigment that you associate with photosynthesis, as well as the accessory pigments, are\nembedded in the thylakoid membranes and arranged in a structure called the antenna\ncomplex \u2014 given this name because it captures and routes the energy from sunlight to a\ncollector called a reaction center.\nEnergy gain. Tom Michaels\nAs shown above, when light hits a pigment molecule in the antenna complex, the energy\nfrom the light photon promotes (pushes up) an electron in one of the pigment\u2019s atoms to\na higher orbital as seen in the cartoon and energy is gained.\nEnergy loss. Tom Michaels 354 | 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nThe electron can\u2019t stay in that higher orbital indefinitely, and when it drops back to its\nhome orbital it releases the energy it absorbed from light, denoted as energy loss. This\nreleased energy can be passed to another pigment molecule. This process of one pigment\ncapturing the photon\u2019s energy and passing that energy onto adjacent pigment molecules\nis the crucial step in energy transformation that takes place in photosynthesis.

Water is split when the reaction center grabs electrons from water, which separates\n+ \u2013\nwater into oxygen gas (O ), hydrogen ions (H ), and electrons (e ).\n2\nTo reiterate, the light is captured by the light harvesting complex (antenna complex) 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 355\nwhere electrons in the chlorophyll atoms are excited and jump up to a higher orbital.\nWhen the electron drops back, the energy is transferred to an adjacent pigment atom.\nThis resonance energy travels down the antenna complex to the reaction center, where\nthe captured energy pulls electrons out of water molecules, and water is split into oxygen\ngas, hydrogen ions, and electrons. The energy that was present in the photons of light\nhas been transferred to the hydrogen ions and the electrons. We\u2019ll see more of how that\nenergy is used in the next section.\nReview questions\n1. What wavelength(s) of light does chlorophyll a absorb? Chlorophyll b?

How is the energy in light transformed in the Light Reaction?\nRecall that the overall equation for photosynthesis is:\nwater + carbon dioxide -> oxygen, water, and simple sugars\n12H 0 + 6CO -> 6O + 6H O + C H O\n2 2 2 2 6 12 6\nThis equation is made up of two parts called half-reactions. The first half-reaction is an\nequation summarizing the Light Reaction, where energy from sunlight is used to split\nwater molecules into oxygen gas, some electrons, and some hydrogen ions. The energy\nfrom sunlight is transferred from the pigments to these hydrogen ions and electrons. The\nhalf-reaction for the Light Reaction is as follows:\n\u2013 +\n12H O -> 6O + 24e + 24H\n2 2 356 | 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nLight independent reaction\nThe Light-Independent Reaction (LIR) is the second part of photosynthesis. It takes place\nin the stroma of the chloroplast. Unlike the Light Reaction, it does not require light. In\nthe LIR, two compounds, NADPH and ATP, carry the energy from light that was originally\ntransformed into hydrogen ions and electrons through the splitting of water. The NADPH\nand ATP, along with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, enter a process called the\nCalvin Cycle, where the energy is used to fix carbon into a molecule abbreviated G3P.\nThis process requires the help of an important protein abbreviated RuBisCO\n(Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) that catalyzes the step in the process\nwhere the carbon from atmospheric CO is incorporated into an organic molecule.\n2\nRuBisCO is the most abundant protein in leaves and, given the number of leaves in the\nworld, likely the most abundant protein on the planet. The G3P produced by the carbon\nfixation process is called a triose phosphate, meaning it is a 3-carbon sugar (triose)\nwith phosphorus and oxygen atoms (phosphate) attached. Triose phosphate moves out\nof the chloroplast into the mesophyll cell\u2019s cytoplasm, where two of these three-carbon\nmolecules are combined to produce the 6-carbon molecules glucose and fructose. The\nglucose and fructose molecules then combine to form sucrose, a 12-carbon organic\nmolecule. Sucrose is important because it is the sugar that is transported by the phloem\nthroughout the plant to provide energy and building blocks for other organic molecules\nlike starch and cellulose.\nThe half-reaction for the LIR is:\n+ \u2013\n24H + 24e + 6CO -> C H O + 6H O\n2 6 12 6 2\nReview questions\n1.

The black dots in\nthe green thylakoid membrane represent the antenna complexes. Light hits the antenna\ncomplex and transfers its energy to pigments, and the energy is funneled to the reaction\ncenter where water (H O) is split in the light reaction to form the energy carriers ATP and\n2 358 | 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nNADPH.

CC0 1.0\nWithin a plant, the regions of photosynthesis and sugar production are called the source. 11.2 LIGHT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 359\nLeaves are typically the main source within the plant, since that is where most\nphotosynthesis takes place. Those regions that do not support photosynthesis (like roots),\nbut that still need organic molecules to survive, are called sinks. Movement of solutes\n(molecules dissolved in water) like sucrose from source to sink through the phloem is\ncalled translocation. Translocation of sucrose through the phloem to the sink provides\ncells with a source of stored energy, and also building blocks for organic molecules, as\nnoted earlier. Sucrose can be broken down to glucose and fructose, building blocks used\nto form other extremely useful organic compounds. Two particularly useful compounds\nresult from the production of long glucose chains: starch, a key energy storage compound\nin plant cells, and cellulose, the main constituent of the cell wall and key to a plant\u2019s\nstructural integrity. Wood, for instance, is primarily made up of the cellulose-rich cell walls\nof dead xylem. Both starch and cellulose are long chains of glucose, but they differ in the\nway the glucose molecules are linked together.\nCellulose is the molecule into which carbon extracted from atmospheric CO is\n2\nsequestered for long-term storage. Starch sequesters carbon for a much shorter period\nof time because it is either eaten, used by the plant for new growth, or decomposed by\nbacteria and fungi that can utilize starch for energy.\nReview question\n1.

Although a plant produces (fixes) its own carbon-based molecules from\nphotosynthesis, all other nutrients are taken up by the roots from soil. As we harvest plant\nmaterial and dead plant material decomposes, these nutrients are depleted.

Soil texture refers to the relative\nproportion of sand, silt, and clay particles in the soil. Sand, silt and clay are the three sizes\nof mineral particles (originating from rock rather than from previously living material) that\nmake up soil. Sand is the largest particle, silt is intermediate, and clay is very small. In\nrelative terms, if sand is a 55-gallon barrel, silt is the size of a plate, and clay is the size of\na dime.\nSoil particle size. Antonio Jord\u00e1n. CC BY-SA 3.0\nThis mixture of different-sized particles is called texture because of how different\ncombinations of these particle types make soil feel when you rub a sample between your\nthumb and forefinger. High amounts of sand makes a soil sample feel gritty, more silt\nmakes it feel floury, and lots of clay makes it feel like velvet when dry and sticky when wet.\nYou can get a good idea of the texture of a field soil by doing a simple \u201cjar test:\u201d put soil\nin a jar, add water, shake the jar, then wait a few days to see the layers of different size\nparticles settle. 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH | 369\nSoil texture triangle. Lewi1224. CC BY-SA 4.0\nThe USDA Soil Texture Triangle, above, indicates the type of soil for different percentages\nof sand, silt, and clay. Notice that there are lines running through the triangle; these are\nto help you associate the percentages on the margins of the triangle with locations in the\ninterior. The numbers on the margins are angled so that they are roughly parallel to the\nassociated index lines. For example, the 60% clay index line is a horizontal line extending\nto the right of the 60 on the percent clay margin. The 20% silt index line runs from the\nupper right to the lower left of the triangle. And the 20% sand index line runs up from the\nlower right to upper left; all three lines are marked with a red arrow. These lines intersect\nat the red dot in the middle of the Clay area, indicating that a soil with 60% clay, 20%\nsilt, and 20% sand is classified as a clay soil. When farmers talk about their field soil they\noften use the terms in the texture triangle rather than the percentages of sand, silt, and 370 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\nclay. This approach is much less common when talking about the potting mix used in\ngreenhouses, as there is very little real mineral soil (sand, silt, clay) in these mixes.\nSoils high in sand have great drainage and aeration so that roots are exposed to air in\nthe soil and don\u2019t rot as easily. Roots can penetrate sandy soil easily. But sandy soils are\npoor at holding moisture when the weather turns dry, and sands don\u2019t hold nutrients well.\nNutrients and moisture hang on to a soil best when the soil particles have a lot of surface\narea, and sand has the least surface area (relative to particle volume) of the three particle\ntypes.\nClay, in contrast, holds on to water so tenaciously that it is tough for the plant to get the\nwater for itself. Wet clay is sticky, and clay packs together so tightly that when it dries it\nclumps together and turns into hard clods. Roots have difficulty penetrating a dry, clay\nsoil. But clay does have a lot of surface area for its volume, and holds nutrients better than\nother particles. Clay soils tend to be fertile.\nWatch this video to take a look at clay soil aggregates (2:15)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Health Campaign. CC BY 2.0\nAll soil textures have advantages and disadvantages, depending on climate, topography,\nand crop. The soil texture of large areas, like fields, can\u2019t really be modified to suit a\nparticular crop, so a crop must be chosen that does well in the available soil. For example,\nif you have a field with sandy soils you aren\u2019t going to truck in tons of clay and silt to make\nthe soil suitable for corn. Instead, you\u2019ll grow a crop like potato that does reasonably well\non a lighter, sandy soil. For crops grown in greenhouses or containers, however, you can\nchoose the soil texture to suit the crop you want to grow.\nReview questions 372 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\n1. What are the three particles that make up soil texture?\n2. Which is smallest? Largest?\n3. Is a loam soil high or low in clay relative to the other particles?\n4. How do you determine soil texture using a soil jar?\nSoil structure\nSoil structure. Soil Science. CC BY 2.0\nSoil structure refers to the way in which the soil particles and other materials like\nthe organic matter in the soil bind together into clumps. These clumps are called\naggregates. Pure sand does not clump together into aggregates at all (think about how\nhard it is to get sand at a beach to stick together for a sand castle). When sand, silt, clay, 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH | 373\nand organic matter interact to form small aggregates, like the ones shown below, they\ncreate what is called a granular structure. Large holes in the aggregates provide spaces\nfor gasses and water to pass through, while smaller holes hold water. The need for water\nis obvious, but the need for gas exchange may not be. As you know, root cells are growing,\nwhich means they require oxygen and give off carbon dioxide as a waste product. Oxygen\nneeds to be available in the root zone, and carbon dioxide needs to be vented. If soils are\nwaterlogged, plants die because too much carbon dioxide builds up around the roots and\nthe roots are starved of oxygen. It is therefore important for soils to have these holes in\nthe aggregates for gas exchange. This is called the aeration-porosity of the soil. Organic\nmatter, which in this case refers to decaying bits of formerly living material, helps build\nthe aggregates by gently sticking the soil particles together. The space between and within\naggregates provides aeration-porosity.\nThe illustration below includes a cross section of soil, showing several soil aggregates\npacked together. Each aggregate is built from sand, silt, clay, and organic matter (also\ncalled humus). Note the micro- and macropores for water and gas exchange.\nSoil aggregation. Queensland Government. CC BY 4.0\nSoil with granular aggregation that favors plant growth by holding water and nutrients,\nyet allows for drainage and gas exchange, is said to have good tilth. The soil hangs\ntogether (unlike sand), doesn\u2019t form hard clumps (unlike clay), and breaks apart into 374 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\ncrumbly moist chunks when you turn over a spade of earth. While gardeners are usually\nstuck with whatever soil texture they might have in their gardens., one of the most\nimportant and readily accomplished tasks a gardener can take on to improve garden soil\nis to improve the soil structure by:\n\u2022 increasing the soil organic matter, and\n\u2022 reducing soil compaction.\nIncreasing soil organic matter will improve and stabilize soil aggregation. Reducing\ncompaction, like foot traffic through the garden, will maintain the macro-and micropores\nin the soil to promote drainage, moisture retention, and gas exchange.\nWatch this video to take a close look at a sandy soil (2:41)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1561#oembed-3\nReview questions\n1. What makes up the glue that holds the soil particles into aggregates?\n2. Why is gas exchange in soils important for plant growth?\nSoil organic matter\nSoil organic matter refers to carbon-based material in the soil that was originally a living 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH | 375\norganism, whether plant, animal, or microbe. Sometimes, soil organic matter also refers\nto organisms such as bacteria, fungi, insects, and worms that are still living in the soil,\nbut this discussion refers to the materials that were once alive and are now dead and\ndecomposing. Leaves, stems, and roots eventually die, are incorporated into the soil,\nand decompose. Soil organisms decompose the former living material and transform it\ninto material called humus. Humus is sticky, and helps bind soil particles together into\naggregates, as noted above. Humus also can absorb and hold up to six times its weight\nin water, so it is very important in improving light (sandy) soils. The decomposing organic\nmatter also releases nitrogen and other nutrients that the plant can take up for growth.\nAnd finally, humus, like clay, holds nutrients in the soil through electrochemical charge;\norganic matter is negatively charged, so it holds positively charged cations like calcium\nthat are important for plant growth.\nIn summary, organic matter is formerly living matter that is transformed in the soil into\nhumus. Humus helps stick soil particles together to improve soil structure, holds water in\ndroughty soils, and holds plant nutrients. Decomposing organic matter makes nutrients\nsuch as nitrogen available to plants.\nOrganic matter is added to soils in several forms:\nCompost\nFor gardeners, this may be the most familiar form of organic matter. Leaves, weeds,\ngrass clippings, and other organic material are mixed together and occasionally turned to\npromote decomposition. This results in humus that, when added to the soil, builds soil\nstructure. Most of the nutrients have been used by the organisms that are decomposing\nthe organic matter, are lost to the air, or are leached away by rain, so compost isn\u2019t very\neffective as a nutrient source. Its main purpose is to build soil structure and assist in\nretaining available moisture and nutrients. 376 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\nCompost pile. nancybeetoo.

Green manure crops are used to change soil structure by\nincorporating organic matter directly into the soil. This technique is also used extensively\nin horticultural crop production to reduce soil-borne pathogens, and these crops serve a\nvery useful purpose of smothering weeds.\nMixed species green manure crop. UGA CAES/Extension. CC BY-NC 2.0\nIncorporating crop residues\nAfter a crop is harvested, it is good agricultural and horticultural practice to incorporate\nthe remaining plant material into the soil. Sometimes this is done with a moldboard plow\nto completely bury the residue, but the more modern method is to use the bare minimum 378 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\nof tillage, or to leave the residue on the top of the soil and plant over the dead material\nthe next spring. The latter method, called no-till, is particularly useful for minimizing soil\nerosion caused by soil particles blowing away with the wind or moving with flowing water.\nThe addition of too much organic matter that has too much carbon and not enough\nnitrogen can deplete the soil of nitrogen and harm plant growth. For instance, if you try\nto improve the organic matter of your soil by tilling in bales of straw or sawdust (both\nof which are almost all cellulose, which is very high in carbon), when the microbes begin\nto break the straw down they need to absorb nitrogen from the soil just for their own\ngrowth. If instead you add manure to the soil, which is a blend of straw (high carbon) and\nanimal waste (high nitrogen), the microbes can use the nitrogen from the manure for their\nown growth as they decompose the organic matter and make more nitrogen available to\nplants.\nReview questions\n1. Why add organic matter to the soil?\n2. Is all organic matter of the same value when added to soil, or are some types of organic\nmatter better than others? Why?\nContainers and raised beds\nGarden soil cannot be used for container gardens, sa it compacts too tightly in pots and\nhas terrible drainage.

This\ntable is made with 2\u00d74 lumber for the sides and legs, with hardware cloth and landscape\nfabric for the bottom of the table. The growth medium is normally a peat-based potting\nmix. A table this size supplies enough salad greens throughout the summer for two adults.\nYou could modify it to have deeper soil so that you can raise a tomato or pepper plant. 380 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\nSalad table with plants.

This\nis called the fertilizer\u2019s analysis. The numbers represent the percentage of the fertilizer\nthat is nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) \u2014 always in that order. N, P,\nand K are the elements needed by plants in the greatest quantities. Nitrogen is a key\nelement found in protein, phosphorus is an important component in energy transfer\nmolecules like ATP and as part of the DNA backbone, and potassium is an essential part\nof the mechanism for moving nutrients into and out of cells. Other elements can also be 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH | 381\nimportant in small quantities and in special circumstances, but N, P, and K are the most\ncommon plant nutrients.\nFertilizer bag. Pixabay. Pixabay license\nA 10-10-10 general purpose garden fertilizer has 10% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus, and 10%\npotassium. The rest is filler, like sand or fine gravel. In Minnesota, fertilizers available\nto homeowners typically have no phosphorus because of legislation aimed at reducing\nphosphorus runoff into our lakes. Phosphorus is considered to be the limiting factor in\nalgae growth, so if phosphorus runs off yards and gardens into lakes it causes algae\nblooms. In addition, our garden soils normally have sufficient phosphorus. A general\nfertilizer analysis without phosphorus would be 10-0-10. Nitrogen is usually the nutrient\nmost limiting for plant growth, so it is worth it to read through the labels.\nA caution: seeking the best value per pound of N isn\u2019t always the right strategy. Sometimes\nthe form of the nutrient is important. If you are interested in growing a hydroponic salad\ntable, the plants need a particular form of nitrogen called nitrate, which is not usually\nfound in big, cheap bags of fertilizer; it\u2019s more likely to be found at a hydroponic shop, and\ncosts more per pound of N than other forms. 382 | 12.1 SOILS, FERTILITY, AND PLANT GROWTH\nReview question\n1.

Meristems are sites of cell division in plants. These new cells may\nthemselves divide once or twice, but then they begin to enlarge and differentiate into\ncells with specialized function depending upon the type of tissue in which they occur.\n(Parenchyma cells are an exception because they remain undifferentiated. They can\nbecome meristematic and divide to form plant parts like lateral roots, to form\ninterfascicular cambium, and to respond to wounds by filling in space with new cells called\ncallus tissue.)\nFor a cell to divide into two identical cells, it is critical that all the components of the\noriginal cell are duplicated prior to cell division and then distributed between the two\nsister cells before they separate. It is also critical that the hereditary material, the DNA in\nthe nuclear chromosomes, be exactly duplicated and equally distributed between sister\ncells. Exact duplication and equal distribution ensure that each cell in the organism has all\nthe genetic instructions it needs to carry on its metabolic processes, and that every cell in\nthe organism has the same instructions.\nThe type of cell division that takes place in meristems, which is the type where one cell\ndivides into two identical sister cells, is called mitosis.\nMitotic cell division was first observed under light microscopes well over 150 years ago.\nMicroscopists, scientists who use microscopes, noticed dark-staining cell bodies lined up\nin the middle of a cell that was about to divide. They called these cells chromosomes\n(based on the Latin for dark staining, \u201ckhr\u00f4ma,\u201d and bodies, \u201cs\u00f4ma\u201d). Once lined up in\nthe middle of the cell, the chromosomes divided and moved to opposite poles in the\ncell just prior to the actual division of the cell into two sister cells. It was clear to those\nscientists that the process of cell division ensured that the chromosomes were specially\nand carefully handled during cell division. In 1902, Water Sutton, studying grasshoppers,\nprovided proof (optional reading) that chromosomes contained the hereditary material\nfor the organism. That\u2019s why cell division includes such careful division of the\nchromosomes \u2014 the organism needs to ensure that every cell has an exact copy of all of\nthe hereditary material associated with that organism.\nWhat makes up these chromosomes? The short answer is that chromosomes found in the\nnucleus of plant cells are composed of chromatin (optional reading). Chromatin is made\nup of DNA wrapped around proteins, called histones. These proteins around which the\nDNA wraps are called histones. We\u2019ll start with the structure of DNA and build up to a\nchromosome. 13.1 DNA | 391\nDNA structure\nWatch this video for an explanation of DNA structure (4:35)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

CC BY 4.0\nDNA is a double-stranded chemical polymer (a polymer is several types of molecules\nbonded together) that looks like a flexible ladder twisted on its long axis. Each side, or\nsingle strand of the ladder, is made up of a chain of alternating ribose and phosphate\nmolecules. Ribose is a sugar molecule composed of a ring of five carbons. These\nmolecules are linked to each other by a phosphate molecule made up of one phosphorus\natom and two oxygen atoms. This sequence of ribose and phosphate molecules\nconstitutes what is called the DNA\u2019s ribose-phosphate backbone.\nThe steps, or rungs, of the ladder are constructed from pairs of bases. Four types of\nthese bases compose both strands of DNA. Two of the bases, collectively called purines\n\u2014 Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) \u2014 contain two rings of carbon atoms. The other two, 392 | 13.1 DNA\ncollectively called pyrimidines \u2014 Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) \u2014 have only one ring\nof carbon atoms. There is enough space between the sides of the ladder (or ribose-\nphosphate backbone) to fit two bases with a total of three carbon rings, so each rung of\nthe ladder always has one purine bonded to one pyrimidine.\nStructure of DNA. OpenStax. CC BY 3.0\nThere isn\u2019t enough space for two purines, and there is too much space for two\npyrimidines. And because of the molecular structures of the bases, Adenine (A) always\nbonds with Thymine (T), because they each can share two hydrogen bonds, and Cytosine\n(C) always bonds with Guanine (G), because they each can share three hydrogen bonds. 13.1 DNA | 393\nAs a consequence, the rungs on the ladder are always made up of AT, TA, GC, or CG. And\nthe sequence or order of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs making up the rungs along one strand of the\nladder is the genetic code carried in the DNA. With only rare exceptions, the code is read\nthree-bases at a time and encodes all of the information for a plant\u2019s life cycle.\nReview questions\n1. If you know that a rung of the DNA ladder has the base Adenine, then the other base to\nwhich it is bonded is Thymine. Why not Guanine? Why not Cytosine?\n2. We take for granted now that chromosomes are the hereditary material in plants. When was\nthis proven? A) about 15 years ago when the first genetically modified foods were\ndeveloped, B) around the time the atom bomb was developed, C) just before WWI, or D)\nback when Mendel was doing experiments with peas and discovering his principles of\ninheritance.\n3.

CC BY-SA 3.0\nWe now have a DNA helix made up of alternating ribose and phosphate rails with rungs\ncontaining a purine and a pyrimidine. The DNA helix strand next loops around\nnucleosomes (optional reading) which are made up of histone proteins (illustration\nabove). The histone proteins are essentially the spools around which the DNA thread\nwraps, except that DNA doesn\u2019t wrap continuously around one histone protein the way\nthread wraps around one spool. It makes a couple of loops and then moves on to the next\nhistone protein.\nThe loops of DNA around these nucleosomes are separated by portions of naked DNA\ncalled linker DNA, so the effect is called \u201cbeads on a string\u201d (see micrograph below).\nwhere the beads are the DNA loops and histone protein, and the string is the strand\nof linker DNA. This description dates back to the early days of exploring DNA using\nlight microscopy. Chromosomes could be observed with the aid of the microscope and\ndescribed, but their composition was unknown. 13.1 DNA | 395\nBlack brackets highlight individual nucleosomes; black arrowheads point to nucleosome core particles (the beads), white arrowheads\nto linker DNA (the string).

Think of a chromosome as a tightly and carefully packed long thread\nof DNA that is associated with histone proteins to help with the packing.\nHere\u2019s a diagram of this coiling: 396 | 13.1 DNA 13.1 DNA | 397\nChromosome coiling.

At this phase there is extensive\ncoiling (DNA coiling is called \u201ccondensation\u201d) of the chromatin (DNA + histone proteins).\nNote that there are two sister chromatids. Just prior to cell division these sister\nchromatids will separate at the centromere (the constricted spot where they are\nattached) and move to opposite sides of the cell.\nIt is helpful to have this detail so you can recognize where the genetic code sits in the\nDNA molecule, and how DNA is folded up and condensed into a tight package during cell\ndivision. When a cell is not dividing, parts of the chromosome relax, unfold, and uncoil so\nthat the DNA base pairs in specific parts of the chromosome that provide the code for\nspecific cellular functions can open up, be copied, and the code can be translated into 398 | 13.1 DNA\nproteins that do the cell\u2019s metabolic business \u2014 a phase called \u201cinterphase\u201c). During cell\ndivision, however, the package is tightly condensed (metaphase).\nReview questions\n1. Why do you think the chromosome is so highly condensed (meaning wrapped and folded)\nduring metaphase, which is in the middle of cell division?

You\u2019ll see that about 3/4 of the cycle is called Interphase and the other 1/4\nis called M (for mitosis). As noted, during interphase the cell isn\u2019t dividing (but may be\npreparing to divide); the cell divides during M. Interphase is divided into three parts: G1\n(the \u201cG\u201d is short for \u201cGap\u201d or \u201cGrowth\u201d), S (S for DNA \u201cSynthesis\u201d), and G2. 13.1 DNA | 399\nCell cycle. OpenStax. CC BY 4.0\nThe stages in the cell cycle are:\n\u2022 G1 \u2014 cells are enlarging, and some are differentiating into specialized cells like\nepidermis, collenchyma, sclerenchyma, and cells in the xylem and phloem tissue that\nwill no longer divide. These differentiated cells stay in G1 until death.\n\u2022 S \u2014 chromosomes in cells like apical meristem cells, vascular and cork cambium, or\nundifferentiated parenchyma cells prepare to divide by replicating their\nchromosomes. To prepare for division, the cell makes a complete copy of all of its\nDNA, so in the process of copying the DNA there is DNA Synthesis. Once a\nchromosome has been replicated, the two copies are called sister chromatids and\nthey are held together at a spot called the centromere. The sister chromatids are\nexactly alike, down to the exact order of AT, TA, CG, and GC bases in the rungs of the\nDNA backbone.\n\u2022 G2 \u2014 the cell builds up the chemical machinery that it needs for division.\n\u2022 M \u2014 finally, the cell heads into mitosis (M), addressed next. 400 | 13.1 DNA\nNote that the size of the slices of pie in the diagram above are not indicative of the actual\ntime duration.\nReview questions\n1.

Boumphreyfr. CC BY-SA 3.0\nPloidy\nThe previous lesson focused on DNA\u2019s ribose-phosphate backbone, on the purine and\npyrimidine bases, and on how DNA complexes with protein and coils to form chromatin.\nHere we\u2019ll look more closely at the synthesis (S) phase of interphase and at the mitosis (M)\nphase. Recall that the mitosis phase of the cell cycle \u201cpie\u201d is divided into four stages; we\u2019ll\nlook now at what happens in each of those stages and how it contributes to the outcome\nof mitosis, the equal division of chromosomes into two daughter cells. 13.2 MITOSIS | 403\nPloidy refers to the number of sets of homologous (identical) chromosomes in a cell.\n\u2022 In higher organisms like plants (and animals, including humans), gamete cells (egg\nand sperm) typically each contain one set of each of the chromosomes found in that\nparticular species. When cells contain one set of chromosomes characteristic of the\nspecies, this state is called haploid and is abbreviated n.\n\u2022 When the sperm and egg, each of which are n, unite to form a zygote, the zygote cell\nnow has two sets of chromosomes, one from the male parent\u2019s sperm and one from\nthe female parent\u2019s egg. When cells contain two sets of chromosomes, they are\ndescribed as diploid, abbreviated 2n.\n\u2022 Recall that one result of double fertilization in plants is that one sperm cell unites\nwith two female polar bodies to create the endosperm found in seeds. Endosperm\ncells have three sets of chromosomes, two from the female parent\u2019s polar nuclei (n\n+ n) and one from the male parent\u2019s sperm (n), so this tissue is triploid, abbreviated\n3n.\nMost of the cells of flowering plants that we have studied so far, like the cells making up\nthe epidermis, cortex, and vascular tissues (but not the sperm and eggs cells), are called\nsomatic cells, and are diploid (2n). Each cell carries two sets of chromosomes: one from\nthe male parent and one from the female parent.\nEach species of plant has a characteristic number of chromosomes in its somatic cells. Bur\noak has 24. The garden petunia has 14. Green bean has 22. Half of those chromosomes\ncame from the egg and half from the sperm, so the plant has two sets of chromosomes. In\nthe bean, the 22 chromosomes can be numbered from 1 to 11 based on their morphology\n(chromosomes have different lengths). The numbering only goes to 11, even though there\nare 22 chromosomes, because each diploid cell has two copies of chromosome 1, two\ncopies of chromosome 2, and so on. 404 | 13.2 MITOSIS\nIllustration by Dr. Matt Clark, University of Minnesota\nThe illustration above shows this for a hypothetical plant\u2019s somatic cell\u2019s nucleus\ncontaining 6 chromosomes. On the left side, the chromosomes are rearranged into three\npairs of homologs. The matching chromosomes from the two different sets (for instance,\nthe two copies of chromosome 1) are called homologous chromosomes or homologs.\nHomologs carry, at the same location on the chromosome, the genetic information that\naffects the same characteristic or function. The version of the information can be different\nbetween the homologous chromosomes \u2014 that is, the sequence of base pairs may be\nsomewhat different because one homolog came from the female and the other from the\nmale.\nThe homologs look identical and carry genetic information about particular cell functions\nat identical places on the chromosome (shown using dark bands at specific locations\non the chromosome), but the exact base pair sequences at those locations may differ,\nresulting in different alleles and gene function. The parental combinations are shown at\nthe right, and are the haploid contribution that resulted from meiosis. The 50% reduction\nin the sex cells ensures that offspring have the proper diploid chromosome number and\nmatching homologs that are the full compliment of the plants genome. 13.2 MITOSIS | 405\nA cell in the plant\u2019s apical meristem that is preparing to divide is a somatic cell, so it is\ndiploid, and contains two sets of chromosomes. When it undergoes mitosis, the outcome\nwill be two identical diploid sister cells. Each of these sister cells will also be diploid, and\nwill contain exact copies of the two sets of chromosomes that were in the original cell.\n\u201cDaughter\u201d and \u201csister\u201d cells refer to the same thing \u2014 the new cells that arise as the result\nof mitosis.\nFrom our study of meristems, you know that growth is the result of the formation of new\ncells, and the subsequent elongation of those cells. Mitosis is the process that results in\nthe formation of new cells. Cells undergo mitosis, therefore, as part of plant growth.\nReview questions\n1. Somatic cells of beans have 22 chromosomes. How many chromosomes in a bean sperm cell?\n2. Corn egg cells have 10 chromosomes. How many chromosomes are found in a corn seed\u2019s\nendosperm cells?\n3. Why do cells undergo mitosis? Is it important? 406 | 13.2 MITOSIS\nSynthesis\nOutcome of S phase. Christinelmiller. CC BY-SA 4.0\nIf a cell that undergoes mitosis divides into two cells, how can both of these new cells be\nidentical to each other and to the original cell? Won\u2019t the chromosomes in the original\nparent cell be divided in half during division? Won\u2019t the resulting cells be haploid instead\nof diploid? No. The number of chromosomes isn\u2019t reduced during mitotic cell division\nbecause, prior to division, each of the chromosomes replicates (duplicates), meaning that\nthe cell makes an exact copy of each chromosome. This replication process happens\nduring the synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle.\nRemember that G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle are collectively called interphase.\nMost cells in the plant go about their business in the G1 phase. Only those cells called\nupon to divide make the next step, which is to replicate their chromosomes in the\nS phase. Once the chromosomes are replicated, the cell moves into the G2 phase of\ninterphase and awaits mitosis. The S phase is called synthesis because making a copy of\nthe chromosome requires new DNA production, or synthesis.\nThe two chromosomes that are exact copies are called sister chromatids and remain 13.2 MITOSIS | 407\nconnected at one spot along their length; this spot is called the centromere, as shown in\nthe illustration.\nReview questions\n1. If a diploid cell enters S phase with 2n=20 chromosomes, how many sister chromatids are in\nthe cell when it enters G2?\n2. Are the replicated sister chromatids independent or are they connected in some physical\nway?\nStages of mitosis\nThis video provides a view of the fluidity of mitosis in a cell where 2N = 8 chromosomes, 4\npairs = 4 paternal + 4 maternal.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The\ndeep red stained structures in the center of the onion cell\nmicrograph are the chromosomes. They are corralled together\nwithin the nuclear membrane. Recall that during interphase the\nchromosomes are relaxed rather than highly condensed (that is,\nnot extensively coiled or folded), and during the S phase of\ninterphase each chromosome replicates. It makes sense that the\nchromosomes are relaxed because they can\u2019t go through the replication process if they 13.2 MITOSIS | 409\nare tightly coiled, and because chromosomes only need to be coiled so that they can\nwithstand movement and not break. They aren\u2019t moving, just replicating, so being in a\nrelaxed state is perfect. The two identical copies are called sister chromatids and they\nare held together at a site called the centromere. Note that sister chromatids are not the\nsame as homologs. Homologs are corresponding chromosomes, one contributed through\nthe sperm, the other through the egg. Sister chromatids are chromosomes that have\nreplicated, are identical to each other, and are held together at centromeres. You can\u2019t\ndistinguish individual chromosomes in the picture because they are relaxed rather than\ntightly coiled and folded, making them so fine that they are difficult to see.\nProphase\nProphase is the first stage of the M phase. In prophase the\nchromatin begins to coil and condense to form chromosomes. They\nare coiling because they are preparing to move around. You can\nbegin to notice that each chromosome appears to have two strands\n(sister chromatids) and that these sister chromatids are attached to\neach other at a centromere. In prophase the nuclear membrane\ndisappears and the chromosomes spread out to fill up much of the\ncell. During this phase, the spindle apparatus begins to appear. The spindles are\nmicrotubules associated with movement of the chromosomes during division.\nMetaphase\nIn metastage the spindle grows and forms attachments to the pairs\nof sister chromatids at the centromere that connects the sister\nchromatids. This point of attachment is called the kinetochore. The\nsister chromatids move to an imaginary equatorial plate (called the\nmetaphase plate), which is formed along the midline of the cell\nbetween the poles. The sister chromatids are in their most\ncondensed state at metaphase. 410 | 13.2 MITOSIS\nAnaphase\nThe sister chromatids begin to separate at anaphase. When the\nsister chromatids separate, the centromeres divide so that one\nsister chromatid migrates to one pole, and the other migrates to\nthe opposite pole. The chromatids that formed back in the S phase\nof interphase, when the chromosome replicated, now separate,\nand the spindle fibers shorten. With the sister chromatids\nseparated, we can return to calling them chromosomes. Anaphase\nis the stage where the chromosomes carrying the DNA code are divided precisely so that\neach of the resulting cells has exactly the same chromosomes that were in the mother cell\nprior to division. One complete diploid complement of chromosomes (two sets) is\ndelivered to each daughter cell.\nTelophase\nIn telophase, the nuclear membrane forms around the\nchromosomes in each of the daughter cells, a cell plate forms\nbetween these cells, and cell walls separate the newly formed cells\nin a process called cytokinesis. The chromosomes decondense\nand again become relaxed chromatin. Telophase is the last stage of\nthe M phase. After telophase and cytokinesis, the cells return to G1\nof interphase.\nReview questions\n1. When do the sister chromatids separate from each other?\n2. Do the chromosomes replicate during mitosis or during interphase? 13.2 MITOSIS | 411\n3. Why are the chromosomes in their most condensed state during metaphase and retain this\ncondensed state through chromatid migration in anaphase?\nReview\nRecall that the outcome of mitosis is two cells with DNA identical to that in the original cell.\nThere are three keys to understanding how two cells are formed from one, both with the\nsame DNA as the original cell:\n1. The DNA is completely replicated during the S stage of interphase. This replication\nresults in twice as many sister chromatids as there were chromosomes, and once\nthese sister chromatids separate and are evenly allocated to the two new sister cells,\nboth sister cells have the diploid number of chromosomes, just like the original cell\nprior to division.\n2. As the cell prepares to divide, the DNA condenses. This packaging helps keep the\nvery thin DNA helices from being broken, and keeps the DNA organized into a tight\npackage so that the cell can keep track of it and move it around.\n3. The process is very organized. For instance, the sister chromatids all line up in the\nmiddle of the cell at metaphase, split at the centromere, and half the chromatids go\nto one side of the cell, half to the other. This orderly separation of the sister\nchromatids ensures that the right number of chromosomes is packaged into each of\nthe new sister cells.\nThere are many sites online that illustrate mitosis, but particularly relevant here are ones\nthat show micrographs of plant cells. You may discover that there are some details about\nthe spindles and their apparent site of origin that differ between descriptions of mitosis\nin animal and plant cells; not everything online pertains to plants. Any mention of a\nstructure called a \u201ccentriole\u201d refers to animal cell mitosis, not plants (as plants don\u2019t have\ncentrioles).\nJohn H. Wahlert and Mary Jean Holland, of Baruch College, authored this site showing\nstages of mitosis in onion. (You can ignore the stages of whitefish mitosis in the second 412 | 13.2 MITOSIS\nhalf of the site unless you are interested in the differences between plant and animal\nmitosis.) 13.3 MEIOSIS | 413\n13.3 MEIOSIS\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will:\n\u2022 Understand how meiosis starts with one diploid cell and results in four haploid cells.\n\u2022 Know how meiosis produces gametes that are genetically diverse.\n\u2022 Be able to model the stages of meiosis.\n\u2022 Be able tompare the similarities and differences in the mechanics of mitosis and meiosis.\nReview of sexual and asexual propagation\nAs seen earlier, there are two broad categories of plant propagation: sexual and asexual.\nWhen new plants are produced from existing plant parts, like pieces of leaf, stem, or root,\nreproduction is asexual and the only type of cell division that has taken place is mitosis,\nwhere one diploid cell produces two identical diploid cells.\nIf new plants are instead produced from seeds, this is a strong indication (but not a\ncertainty\u2026optionally read about apomixis) that reproduction was sexual. Plants that\npractice sexual reproduction use mitotic cell division when increasing the diploid\nvegetative parts of the plant like stem, leaf, and root, but use meiotic cell division to initiate\nthe haploid stage of the plant that ultimately results in production of egg and sperm\ncells central to sexual reproduction. Instead of two diploid cells from one diploid cell (the\noutcome of mitosis), the outcome of meiosis is four haploid cells from one diploid cell. 414 | 13.3 MEIOSIS\nSexual reproduction of an angiosperm. LadyofHats, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons.\nPlant growth is divided into two generations that are diploid (2n) and haploid (1n). Higher\nplants (angiosperms) have a long-lived sporophytic generation that is the diploid\nsporophyte. The sporophyte is the growth you would easily recognize as a plant. Through\nthe process of meiosis, the sporophyte produces haploid spores in the flower. The spores\nare the gametophytic generation. Meiosis occurs in the male flower parts to produce\npollen (represented by the green circle) and the female floral organs produce egg cells\n(represented by the white circle). Spores grow by mitosis producing more haploid cells,\nthis is the gametophytic generation. We get a brief glimpse of the gametophytic 13.3 MEIOSIS | 415\ngeneration when pollen is released from the flower, the female gametes are hidden\nfrom direct view in the ovary. When the haploid gametes (male pollen and female egg\ncells) unite they reform the sporophytic generation producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The\nzygote grows into the embryo of the seed and eventually into the plant we see. Lower\nplants, mosses and ferns that are not flowering plants, also alternate generations, but the\ngametophytic generation is longer lived and separate from the sporophytic generation.\nMitosis/meiosis cycle. Menchi. CC BY-SA 3.0\nThe plant doesn\u2019t magically transition to being haploid, but instead particular parts of the\nflower in the androecium and gynoecium develop and protect a limited number of haploid\ncells, called the male gametophyte and female gametophyte. A later chapter addresses\nhow the male and female gametophyte include the haploid egg and sperm cells that must\nunite to form the diploid embryo in seeds. For now, know that meiosis is the gateway\ninto the haploid phase. Meiosis is the type of cell division that starts with diploid cells and\nresults in haploid cells. Without meiosis there is no egg and sperm, and thus no sexual\nreproduction. 416 | 13.3 MEIOSIS\nPropagation and natural selection\nFrom the natural selection perspective, how do asexual and sexual reproduction differ?\nIn asexual reproduction, the plants are genetic copies of the parent plant. Cell division\nis strictly mitosis. Except for rare mutations, the resulting progeny are identical to the\nparents. The fitness of the progeny will mirror the fitness of the parent. The downside of\nthis type of propagation is that there is no genetic variance among progeny that might\nresult in selection for plants that have greater fitness than the parent for characteristics\nsuch as increased cold hardiness, drought tolerance, or disease resistance. The upside\nis that if the parent has high fitness to begin with (and it must have had reasonable\nfitness to reach reproductive age), all progeny will also have that high level of fitness.\nIf the environment remains the same as it was for the parent, the progeny will stand a\ngood chance of reproductive success. But if the environment changes, the fitness of the\nprogeny may no longer be optimum.\nIn sexual reproduction, since one gamete comes from the male parent and one from\nthe female, and because in a population of cross-pollinating wild plants there are many\npotential parents, each with different genotypes, there are many potential genetic\ncombinations of male and female gametes. Not only are the plants producing the gametes\neach genetically different, but each gamete from each plant is potentially unique. The\nmany combinations of male and female gametes, and the uniqueness of gametes from\nthe same plant, result in a substantial genetic variation among the progeny of plants that\nsexually reproduce. Some of these progeny will have greater fitness than others, and will\nbe favored by natural selection \u2014 some will survive to reproductive age and have more\nprogeny than other plants, while the rest will either not survive to reproduce or, if they\ndo reproduce, it will be with low frequency. The DNA of the fittest plants will thus be\nrepresented more frequently in the next generation of plants than the DNA of the least fit\nplants, which may never survive to reproduce and pass on their DNA. This is the process\nof natural selection. The DNA of reproductively successful parents is passed on the next\ngeneration, while the DNA of reproductively unsuccessful parents is not.\nSex generates genetic variation. Genetic variation, generated by meiosis and sexual\nreproduction, is the fuel for the engine of natural selection. 13.3 MEIOSIS | 417\nPloidy review\nTo review: if you count the number of chromosomes in a somatic cell, for instance a root\ntip cell, you will find that there is always an even number. These are diploid 2n cells that\narose from mitotic cell divisions tracking all the way back to the zygote that formed the\nembryo of the seed. Listed below are the numbers of chromosomes found in somatic,\ndiploid, 2n cells of a few commonly grown plants. Note that the number of chromosomes\nis even, never odd, and that it doesn\u2019t imply anything about the size or type of plant:\n\u2022 Corn = 20\n\u2022 Rice = 24\n\u2022 Soybean = 40\n\u2022 Green bean = 22\n\u2022 Tomato = 24\n\u2022 Potato = 48\n\u2022 Apple = 34\n\u2022 Rose = 14\nDiploid cells always contain an even number of chromosomes because there are two\ncopies of each chromosome, one contributed by the male sperm and one by the female\negg. If you number each type of corn chromosome 1 through 10, there would be two\n1s (a maternal and a paternal), two 2s, etc. Recall that the two (donated from the male\nand female) versions of the same chromosome in a diploid cell are called homologous\nchromosomes or homologs. In a diploid cell like corn where 2n=20, there are 10 pairs of\nhomologous chromosomes.\nAlso recall that the number of chromosomes in a gamete is half the number of\nchromosomes found in a somatic cell of the same plant. The gamete cells are haploid,\nabbreviated n. There may be an even or odd number of haploid chromosomes, depending\non the diploid chromosome number. Beans have a diploid number of 22, so the gametes\nhave an odd number of chromosomes (11). Tomato has a diploid number of 24, so the\ngametes have an even number of chromosomes (12).\nWhen two gametes fuse and form a zygote, the zygote has the 2n chromosome number\nrestored. From then on, the cell divisions that allow a plant to grow from zygote to full\nsize are all mitosis, and all the cells are copies of the zygote formed by fusion of the two\ngametes. 418 | 13.3 MEIOSIS\nReview questions\n1. In what sense is meiosis the gateway into the haploid or gametophytic stage of alternation\nof generations?\n2. Why does a diploid plant cell always have an even number of chromosomes?\n3. A diploid rose cell has 14 chromosomes. How many pairs of homologous chromosomes will\nyou find in that diploid cell? 13.3 MEIOSIS | 419\nMeiosis mechanics\nMeiosis. Emily Tepe\nMeiosis starts with a diploid cell and results in haploid (n) cells that we could correctly call\nspores. In the illustration above, note that starting with one diploid cell and meiosis yields\nfour haploid cells.\nBelow are the stages of meiosis. It won\u2019t be difficult to memorize them because you\nalready know the stages of mitosis, and meiosis builds on mitosis. The illustration shows\na hypothetical species with two pairs of chromosomes (2n=4) in the starting cell and n=2\nin the resulting gamete cells. Meiosis has two chromosome divisions, so the stages are\nlabeled I for those stages associated with the first division (e.g., Metaphase I) and II for\nthose associated with the second division (e.g., Metaphase II). 420 | 13.3 MEIOSIS\nStages of meiosis. Boumphreyfr. CC BY-SA 3.0\nAs in mitosis, the cell division process starts when the chromosomes replicate in the S\nphase of interphase.\nProphase I \u2014 the nuclear membrane disintegrates, and we see that the chromosomes\nhave already replicated (in \u201cS\u201d of interphase) so that the now condensed chromosomes\nare made up of two sister chromatids attached at the centromere. New, however, is\nthat in this stage the homologous chromosomes pair up and form structures called\ntetrads because they are groupings of four sister chromatids (two sister chromatids per\nhomolog). This process of pairing and tetrad formation promotes chiasma (seen under\nthe microscope as the point where sister chromatids of homologs lay over each other,\nforming an \u201cX\u201d shape) and crossing over between sister chromatids of homologous\nchromosomes. Crossing over results in an exchange of DNA between homologs and is\nanother contributor to genetic variation in the gametes and resulting organisms.\nReread the preceding paragraph, making sure you understand how homologs pair, form 13.3 MEIOSIS | 421\nchiasma, and cross over between sister chromatids. This type of pairing of homologs\nand subsequent chiasma formation doesn\u2019t happen in mitosis \u2014 a very important and\nessential difference between the two types of cell division.\nMetaphase I \u2014 the tetrads are lining up on the metaphase plate, ready to divide. Recall\nthat they are called tetrads because they are made up of four sister chromatids.\nAnaphase I \u2014 the tetrads divide and homologs go to opposite poles. Note that sister\nchromatids stay intact and the centromeres do not divide yet. It is the homologous\nchromosomes that separate at Anaphase I. The sister chromatids may differ in some\nplaces along their arms due to crossing over that causes exchange of DNA between\nhomologs.\nTelophase I \u2014 the nuclear membrane reappears to separate the products of the first\ndivision.\nThe DNA relaxes in Interphase I, but no replication occurs. DNA condenses again in\nProphase II, and we can see the chromosomes.\nMetaphase II \u2014 the chromosomes (which are in the form of sister chromatids still\nconnected at the centromere) line up at the metaphase plate, as in metaphase of mitosis.\nAnaphase II \u2014 also like anaphase in mitosis, the centromeres split and sister chromatids\nare pulled to opposite poles.\nTelophase II \u2014 nuclear membrane reforms, cytokinesis takes place, just like the telophase\nof mitosis. Note that the \u201cII\u201d stages of meiosis are just like the corresponding stages of\nmitosis, making them easy to remember.\nReview questions\n1. Do the chromosomes replicate prior to meiosis?\n2. What happens during crossing over? 422 | 13.3 MEIOSIS\n3.

You get four n haploid cells because the initial\ncell undergoes two divisions. The cell first divides into two nuclei, then those two divide\nagain into four. The chromosome number drops from 2n in the original cell to n in each\nof the four haploid cells because the number of sets of chromosomes is reduced from\n2 to 1 (that is, homologs separated to opposite poles) in the first meiotic division, and\nthen the sister chromatids separated in the mitosis-like second meiotic division. There\nwas chromosome replication before the first division, but no replication before the second\ndivision.\nHere\u2019s a summary of what is dividing and when:\nTwo divisions:\nHomologs separate in Anaphase I.

Each pair of homologs moves independently of all the other homolog pairs that\nare also separating. That is, all the paternal-source chromosomes making up the\nhomologous pairs don\u2019t go to one pole and all the maternal-source go to the other\npole (this is possible, but since it would be by chance the probability is very low).\nInstead, paternal-source homologs of some chromosomes and maternal-source\nhomologs of the other chromosomes are pulled to the poles, so that eventually\nthere is a mix of maternal- and paternal-source chromosomes in the gametes, and\nthat mix of maternal and paternal is generally thought to be random.\n\u2022 This principle, where homologs move to poles independently, is called independent\nassortment, and leads to differences in the genotype of the gametes \u2014 one source\nof genetic variation among gametes.\nCrossing over and exchange of DNA between homologous sister chromatids in Prophase\nI is another source of variation in gametes. If two cells in the sporangia are undergoing\nmeiosis, the crossing over in each cell will probably happen in different places on the\nchromosome in each cell, resulting in exchanges taking place at different locations on the\nDNA backbone so that the gametes resulting from different cells going through meiosis\nwill all be unique.\nWhat is crossing over? 13.3 MEIOSIS | 425\nCrossing over.

The sporangium in the anther\n(where the male gametophyte will be formed) is called the microsporangium. The\nsporangium in the ovary (where the female gametophyte will be formed) is called the\nmegasporangium. Diploid microspore mother cells in the microsporangium and diploid\nmegaspore mother cells in the megasporangium divide by meiosis to form four haploid\nmicro- or mega- spores. These spores initiate the gametophyte phase. Two (male) to\nthree (female) mitotic divisions later, the mature micro- and mega- gametophytes have\nbeen formed. Note how few divisions take place to form the gametophyte after the\nmeiotic division of the microspore or megaspore mother cell, and that those two or three\nadditional divisions are mitotic divisions. One round of meiosis is sufficient to generate\nhaploid cells. From there on the divisions are mitotic, but in this case mitosis starts with\none haploid cell and generates two haploid cells. 436 | 14.1 GAMETOGENESIS\nHelleborus foetidus cross-section.

The basal cell undergoes several additional mitotic divisions to\nform a suspensor that anchors the apical cell to the nucellus tissue on the inner surface of\nthe maturing ovule wall (seed coat). Next, the apical cell begins to divide mitotically to form\nthe embryo. The embryo goes through distinctive phases that look like particular shapes.\nThis image shows the early embryo heart shape (second from right), and the torpedo\nshape (far right) stages.

This lesson focuses on the\ninheritance of large differences among plants that you can easily see or measure and can\nreport in qualitative terms, such as red vs, yellow flowers, tall vs, short plants, or early\nvs, late maturity. The next addresses the inheritance of comparatively small differences\nthat require more meticulous measurement and are reported in quantitative terms, such\nas seed yield in kg/ha, or milligrams of sucrose per gram of grape tissue. The expression\nof characteristics that are qualitatively inherited (larger, discrete differences) is influenced\nprimarily by the plant\u2019s genes. The environment has little effect on the plant for these\ncharacteristics. In contrast to qualitative inheritance, plant characteristics that are 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 457\nquantitatively inherited are influenced by the environment, and sometimes the influence\nof the environment overshadows that of the genes themselves.\nRecall that the genetic code lies in the\norder of the purine (Adenine and Guanine)\nand pyrimidine (Cytosine and Thymine)\nbases in the DNA double helix. Some of\nthese base sequences don\u2019t appear to\nhave a function, but others are translated\ninto structural and enzymatic proteins that\ninfluence cell and plant growth. The\nsequences that are translated into\nproteins that influence cell and plant\ngrowth are called genes. In corn, for\nexample, the sucrose manufactured in the\nleaves through photosynthesis is\ntransported through the phloem to the ear\nand into the developing seed or kernel.\nThere the sucrose is broken down to\nsimpler sugars like glucose that are linked\ntogether into starch for storage in the corn\nkernel\u2019s endosperm. The starch synthesis\nStructure of DNA. OpenStax. CC BY 3.0\nprocess is catalyzed by a series of enzymes\nthat are produced as a result of expression\nof a set of corn genes. If even one of those genes is defective and doesn\u2019t produce an\nenzyme used in the sequence of reactions leading to starch, starch production could be\nhalted.\nShrunken-2 (Sh ) corn contains a DNA sequence (gene) mutation that renders\n2\nnonfunctional an enzyme that is key to normal starch biosynthesis. Starch biosynthesis\nis interrupted at an early stage of kernel growth, so instead of accumulating starch, the\nkernel accumulates sucrose in the endosperm. Shrunken-2 (sh ) corn has high kernel\n2\nsucrose levels and is one of the common types of \u201csupersweet\u201d sweet corn. This is an\nexample of a large difference (a qualitative trait), because you can easily distinguish the\ndifference between a bite of starchy field corn from a bite of sweet corn, and because\nthe difference in sweetness is the result of just one mutant gene. This mutation is not,\nhowever, good for the vigor of the plant in the early spring. A seed that has accumulated\nsucrose rather than starch is very susceptible to fungus infection at planting time in 458 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\ncomparison to the starchy seed of field (commonly called dent) corn. Sweet corn is not\nnearly as vigorous during germination as regular dent corn, as the dent corn has stored\nhigh amounts of starch in its endosperm while the sweet corn has not.\nThe principles of qualitative inheritance are consistent with the concepts of DNA structure,\nwith genes and meiotic divisions resulting in segregation, and independent assortment\nof chromosomes. These principles of inheritance were actually worked out before\nknowledge of DNA, genes, and meiosis, using carefully controlled experimentation,\ncrosses between contrasting parents, observation of progeny, and genius in developing\nand testing hypotheses.\nReview questions\n\u2022 Let\u2019s say a carrot breeder is showing us one of her carrot experiments. She planted 20\ndifferent types of carrots. If we see that some of the varieties have red tap roots,\nsome have white roots, and others have the usual orange roots, do we suspect that\nthe genetic control of red, orange, and white root colors is qualitatively (large,\ndiscrete differences) or quantitatively (smaller differences requiring measurement)\ninherited?\n\u2022 If, later in the season, we inspect the data on root yield for each of these 20 varieties, and see\nthat all of the varieties have a fairly similar yield in kilograms per hectare (the highest\nyielding carrot is perhaps 20% higher than that of the lowest yielding carrot), do we suspect\nthat the genetic control of root yield is qualitatively or quantitatively inherited?\nPhenotype, genotype, and environment\nThis simple arithmetic expression highlights a central concept of how genes and\nenvironment combine to influence a plant\u2019s appearance: 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 459\nPhenotype = Genotype + Environment\nPhenotype means the characteristics we actually observe about the plant. Is it tall? Short?\nGreen? Yellow? Starchy? Sweet? The starchiness or sweetness of corn from a garden is\none example of a phenotype. Phenotype is the actual expression of a characteristic in the\nplant that can be measured or expressed in some way.\nGenotype is the genetic composition of a plant, including chromosomes of the nucleus\nand the DNA in chloroplasts and mitochondria. The genotype of a plant is subdivided into\ngenes, which are the hereditary units consisting of a sequence of DNA that occupies a\nspecific location on a chromosome (locus) and determines a particular characteristic in\nan organism. Genes undergo mutation when their DNA sequence changes, which results\nin changes in a gene, for example a flower color gene that mutates from red to white\nin color. The alternative versions of the DNA sequences making up the gene are called\nalleles. Shrunken-2, introduced above, is a gene. That gene is found at a particular location\nof a chromosome, and that location is called the gene\u2019s locus. At that locus will be one of\nthe gene\u2019s alleles. It will either be the allele for the normal enzyme that facilitates starch\nformation, or the mutant allele that blocks starch formation and leads to supersweet corn.\nThe sequence of the purine (A, G) and pyrimidine (C, T) bases along the DNA strand and\nthe differences the sequence imparts to the genetic code produce differences among\ngene alleles.\nEnvironment is the total influence of known and unknown factors, other than genotype,\nthat might affect this trait, like rainfall, soil type and fertility, temperature, insect\npredation, and other influences that we may not recognize, but might still affect the\nphenotype.\nPhenotype is then the sum of the genotypic and environmental effects. If you are a\nsociologist, then you might be familiar with arguments about whether a certain type\nof human behavior is due to \u201cnature\u201d or \u201cnurture.\u201d Roughly, \u201cnature\u201d corresponds to\ngenotype while \u201cnurture\u201d corresponds to environment. A shorthand representation for\nthe equation introduced above is P = G + E, which roughly corresponds to\nBehavior = Nature + Nurture\nFor more on genotype and environment influences on a plant\u2019s phenotype, see this\nWikipedia page (optional).\nGenotype (G) has a much larger influence on phenotype (P) than does environment\n(E) when considering simply inherited characteristics that result in large, qualitative 460 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\ndifferences. Supersweet sweet corn is going to be sweet corn and not starchy field corn\nregardless of whether it is grown in Minnesota, California, or in a greenhouse on Mars. The\nexact amount of sucrose may differ a bit depending on environmental stresses, like how\nhot or cool the growing season is (hot seasons tend to result in slightly more sugar), but\nthe genotype has a much larger impact on the sweet phenotype than the environment.\nIt is quite common for large differences to be inherited through a single gene that has a\nlarge impact. This is called simple inheritance, major gene inheritance, or qualitative\ninheritance.\nIn contrast, environmental effects typically have a major impact on phenotype when\nconsidering inherited characteristics that are expressed as smaller, quantitative\ndifferences, such as those you might find when comparing common bean cultivated\nvarieties (cultivars) for their seed yield, or spinach cultivars for the amount of chlorophyll\nin their leaves. The impact of the environment might even be larger than the effect\nof genotype. For example, the rank order of bean yield for three kidney bean cultivars\ngrown in Minnesota might be Cultivar A > Cultivar B > Cultivar C, but if you grow them\nin Pennsylvania, it could be the reverse, due to a change in environment. It is common\nfor small differences to be inherited through many genes each with a very small impact,\nwhere the cumulative effect of their acting together is noticeable. This is sometimes called\ncomplex inheritance, minor gene inheritance, or quantitative inheritance, because\nmany genes each with small effect are involved.\nReview question\n1. Thinking back to the carrot questions above, will environment have a greater impact on root\nyield or root color? 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 461\nInheritance of a qualitative trait\nWatch this video for an introduction to qualitative traits (11:29)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

He demonstrated that the large differences\npassed from parents to progeny are transmitted between\ngenerations through discrete units or packets of\ninformation that control the expression of specific\ncharacteristics, and that these discrete units are\nindependently inherited. Take a look at this page if you\u2019re\ninterested in more background on Mendel (optional).\nAs noted above, Mendel chose pea, Pisum sativum L., as his\nGregor Mendel. Medical Heritage\nmodel organism. Pea usually self-pollinates. It is one of Library. CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nthose plants where the pollen is shed and the stigma is\nreceptive even before the flower opens (recall that this is called cleistogamy). Egg and\nsperm come from the same plant and, following fertilization, form the embryo. The flower\nis conveniently large enough though that if you very carefully open up a flower bud a few\ndays before the pollen sheds, you can remove the anthers and pollinate the stigma with\npollen from another plant, making it fairly easy to cross if you emasculate the flower and\nsupply another source of pollen. If left to its own devices, however, the pea flower self-\npollinates.\nMendel looked at a number of qualitative traits controlled by single genes, including: 462 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\nGene Phenotype\nSeed shape smooth vs wrinkled\nSeed color green vs yellow\nFlower color purple vs white\nSeveral other obvious pod and plant characteristics that\ncan be seen by eye\nCharacteristics of pea plants. LadyofHats. Public domain\nMendel crossed a parent plant grown from a smooth seed (P ) to another parent (P )\n1 2\ngrown from a wrinkled seed. These parents were selected because they were true\nbreeding, meaning that if they allowed to self pollinate they always produced the same\ntype of seed. When P was pollinated (crossed) with P , all of the seeds resulting from the\n1 2\ncross (called F , short for first filial generation) were smooth-seeded.\n1\nHere\u2019s a summary of the experiment so far:\nP (smooth) X P (wrinkled) \u2192 F (all smooth)\n1 2 1\nMendel then planted the F seeds, let them naturally self-pollinate, and collected the\n1\nseeds produced by these plants. He counted a total of 7324 F (second filial generation)\n2 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 463\nseeds and found that 5474 were smooth and 1850 wrinkled. This is roughly a ratio of\n3 smooth : 1 wrinkled. This, and other similar results, led him to the development of a\nmodel where seed plumpness is controlled by one gene with two different versions (or\nalleles) of the genetic code for that gene. Furthermore, based on the results, when one\nof each allele was present in the F progeny, the allele donated from the smooth seeded\n1\nP parent was dominant to the recessive allele donated from the wrinkled-seeded P\n1 2\nparent. Dominant here means that if two different alleles are present in an organism,\nbut only one is expressed (like the smooth seed being expressed even though alleles for\nboth smooth and wrinkled are present), the allele that is expressed is called the dominant\nallele, and the allele that is not expressed is called recessive. Recessive alleles are only\nexpressed if no dominant alleles are present.\nIf we signify the dominant allele for smooth seeds as the upper case S and the recessive\nallele that codes for a wrinkled shape as lower case s, the three different possible\ngenotypes are:\n\u2022 SS diploids that are smooth (homozygous dominant).\n\u2022 Ss diploids that are also smooth. Here, in the heterozygous genotype, you can tell\nwhich allele is dominant to the other. Both alleles are present (S and s), but only one\nis expressed \u2014 the S \u2014 so S must be dominant to s.\n\u2022 ss diploids that are wrinkled (homozygous recessive).\nNote that, by convention, the designation for the allele ( like S or s) and the genotype (like\nSs) is underlined. 464 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\nF1 generation \u2013 Round/wrinkled pea crossing. Alejandro Porto. CC BY-SA 3.0\nAbove is a diagram showing the smooth (SS) and wrinkled (ss) parents crossing to form\nSs (smooth) F progeny. Recall that if an SS parent goes through meiosis, only an S type\n1\nof gamete is formed. There cannot be any s gametes, because the parent only has the S\nallele. Likewise, only s gametes are possible when an ss parent undergoes meiosis and\nforms gametes. So Ss progeny is the only possible result from crossing an SS parent to an\nss parent. The phenotype of all of these progeny will be smooth because S is dominant\nto s. Notice that, in this example, which is one of big, qualitative differences, there is no\ninfluence of the environment, so Phenotype = Genotype. 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 465\nImage by Emily Tepe.\nThe next step in the experiment is to allow the smooth, Ss F progeny to self-pollinate.\n1\nThe lower part of the above diagram shows that the F plant will produce two types\n1\nof gametes, S and s, in equal numbers. Think back to meiosis and gametogenesis. Just\nbefore a diploid cell with genotype Ss heads into meiosis, the homologous chromosomes\n(one carrying the S allele and the other carrying the s allele) replicate in interphase so\nthat there are four sister chromatids, two with the S allele and two with the s allele. The\nillustration to the left shows how the S and s alleles segregate. The process of meiotic\ncell division will result in each of these sister chromatids winding up in a separate spore,\nso of the four male gametes formed during microgametogenesis, two are carrying S and\ntwo are carrying s. The one surviving gamete from megagametogenesis has an equal\nprobability of being either S or s (recall that of the four spores, only one survives), so if you\nconsider many egg cells, roughly half will be S and half will be s. Mendel\u2019s results, and his\nexplanation, are thus consistent with what we know about meiosis.\nYou can use a simple tool called a Punnett Square to visualize the types of zygotes, and\ntheir expected frequency, formed from the male and female gametes resulting from self-\npollination of an Ss individual, as shown below: 466 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\nF2 Generation. Alejandro Porto. CC BY-SA 3.0\nThe male gametes, S and s are shown in the two columns across the top of the square,\nand the female gametes, also S and s, are listed down the left margin. Each cell shows the\ncontribution of one male gamete and one female gamete.\nIn this example, self-pollinating (also called selfing) an Ss F plant means that we list S and\n1\ns as possible male gametes and also as possible female gametes, since both sperm and 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 467\negg are from the same F plant. The potential zygotes are shown in the four cells inside\n1\nthe square.\nIf you count up the results of from the Punnett square, you find that the genotypic ratios\nof the F progeny are:\n2\n1 SS : 2 Ss : 1 ss\nand the phenotypic ratios are:\n3 S- (Smooth) : 1 ss (Wrinkled)\nwhich is precisely the ratio that Mendel found between smooth and wrinkled seeds in his\nF pea generation. Recall that the difference between the genotypic and phenotypic ratios\n2\noccurs because S is dominant to s so you can\u2019t tell the phenotypic difference between SS\nand Ss genotypes.\nMendel's First Law \u2014 the law of segregation \u2014 states that during gamete formation\neach member of the allelic pair separates from the other member to form the genetic\nconstitution of the gamete. That is, in the F , the Ss diploid produces S and s gametes, not\n1\nSs gametes. Mendel\u2019s work paved the way for figuring out this process.\nReview question\n1. Using the Punnett square diagram above, explain why the expected frequencies for the three\npossible genotypes should indeed be 1 SS : 2 Ss : 1 ss.\nSimultaneous inheritance of two qualitative traits\nWatch this video for an introduction to independent assortment (12:01) 468 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

We\u2019ll simultaneously consider seed shape (or plumpness) and\nanother characteristic, seed color, that Mendel studied. Like seed shape, seed color is\ncontrolled by one gene with two alleles where:\n\u2022 YY diploids are yellow\n\u2022 Yy diploids are also yellow\n\u2022 yy diploids are green\nYou can tell from the heterozygote Yy that the Y allele for yellow color is dominant to the\nrecessive y allele for green.\nNote that the gene for seed shape is on a different chromosome than the gene for\nseed color. Mendel didn\u2019t know this, as the concept of chromosomes had not yet been\nproposed. Because they are on separate chromosomes, seed color and seed shape will\nassort independently.\nLet\u2019s start by crossing a plant that grew from a smooth, yellow seed known to have the\ngenotype SSYY to a plant that grew from a wrinkled green seed with genotype ssyy.\nSSYY X ssyy \u2192 ?\nThe only type of gamete that can be produced by the SSYY parent is SY, and the only type\nthat can be produced from the ssyy parent is sy. The F progeny can only be the double\n1\nheterozygote SsYy, which has smooth, yellow seeds.\nSSYY X ssyy \u2192 SsYy\nNext, allow the SsYy F progeny to self pollinate. Below is a diagram of key stages of\n1\nmeiosis for a cell with genotype SsYy. Note that the seed shape gene is on one type of\nchromosome (straight) and the seed color on another (squiggled). 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 469\nImage by Matthew Clark.\n\u2022 At Prophase I the chromosomes are replicated and show sister chromatids.\n\u2022 At Metaphase I we see that the homologs have synapsed and lined up on the\nmetaphase plate. There are two ways that the recessive and dominant alleles can\nline up on a metaphase plate. The left side of Metaphase I shows that both dominant\ngene homologs are on the same side; the alternative alignment on the right side\nshows that the dominant homolog for one gene could just as likely line up with the\nrecessive homolog for the other gene.\n\u2022 The way they line up at Metaphase I determines how they separate at Anaphase I, so\nthe diagram of Anaphase I shows two alternatives for how the homologs migrate to\nthe poles. This has an impact on the types of spores produced in Telophase II.\n\u2022 In the Telophase II frame above, the left side shows that. based on one of the\nAnaphase I alternatives, the result can be for the dominant S and the dominant Y to\nbe together in one type of spore and both recessive genes together in other spores.\nEqually likely, as shown on the right, the result can b eone dominant gene with one\nrecessive gene. 470 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\nYellow/green/wrinkled/round pea Punnett Square. OpenStax. CC BY 4.0\nMeiosis and gamete formation in the SsYy F thus results in an equal likelihood of four\n1\ntypes of gametes: SY, sY, Sy and sy. If we create another Punnett Square to model self\npollination of the SsYy F and put these four gametes both across the top and down the\n1\nmargin (since we are allowing the plant to self pollinate, and the frequency and genotype\nof the gametes will be the same whether egg or sperm), we get the results shown.\nLooking at the diagrams of the seeds in each cell, you can count the number of times each\nof the four possible phenotypes appears. The phenotypic ratios are: 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES | 471\n9 S-Y- (smooth yellow) : 3 S-yy (smooth green) : 3 ssY- (wrinkled yellow) : 1 ssyy\n(wrinkled green)\nThe dash \u201c-\u201d in the genotype, like S-, means that the allele represented by the \u201c-\u201d could be\neither the dominant or the recessive allele because, regardless of which allele is there, the\nphenotype remains the same. So S- means both SS and Ss genotypes.\nDon\u2019t memorize these ratios, but understand how they were obtained using the Punnett\nSquare. When Mendel conducted this experiment and counted the seeds of each\nphenotype he obtained, he found:\n315 smooth yellow, 108 smooth green, 101 wrinkled yellow, and 32 wrinkled green\nwhich is pretty close to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nThis result for two genes on different chromosomes led to Mendel's Second Law \u2014 the\nLaw of Independent Assortment. During gamete formation, the segregation of the alleles\nof one allelic pair is independent of the segregation of the alleles of another allelic pair\n(illustrated above with the alternative alignments at Metaphase I). That is, when gametes\nform from an SsYy F , and receive either S or s (as stated in the first law of segregation),\n1\nwhether Y goes with S to make up a SY gamete or whether y goes with S to make up a\nSy gamete is completely by chance. Remember the mechanics behind this, from learning\nhow homologs separate through independent assortment in Anaphase I of meiosis.\nMendel\u2019s initial insights on segregation and independent assortment are the foundation\nof genetics. He uncovered the core principles that were only later confirmed by our\nunderstanding of chromosomes, genes, alleles, and cell division. For another optional look\nat Mendel\u2019s laws, and another take on this material, see Phil McClean\u2019s (a Prof at NDSU)\nweb site on Mendelian Genetics.\nReview question 472 | 14.2 INHERITANCE OF BIG DIFFERENCES\n1. Cover up the Punnett Square above, and without peeking, fill in the cells on your own and\nderive the genotype and phenotype ratios from selfing the SsYy hybrid.\n2. What are the differences between the law of segregation and the law of independent\nassortment? 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES | 473\n14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL\nDIFFERENCES\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this section you will:\n\u2022 Know the meaning of linkage and the impact of crossing over on linked loci.\n\u2022 Recognize the difference between qualitative and quantitative inheritance.\n\u2022 Understand how heritability is a measure of the genetic influence over a quantitative trait,\nrelative to other non-genetic influences.\nReview\nThe previous section included examples of simple inheritance, where large, obvious,\ndiscrete differences among plants are controlled by one gene and where one of the alleles\nis completely dominant over the other. Based on the inheritance patterns of round vs.\nwrinkled pea seeds described in that lesson, Mendel developed the Law of Segregation.\nOften called Mendel\u2019s First Law, the Law of Segregation in modern terms states that,\nduring gamete formation, the two alleles for the gene of interest (recall that in diploid\ncells there are two homologs for each type of chromosome, so there are potentially two\nversions or alleles of each gene) separate from each other during meiosis and are passed\nindividually to the next generation through the egg and sperm. This is apparent in the\nmechanics of meiosis, where the homologs separate and migrate to opposite poles in\nAnaphase I and, following the separation of sister chromatids in Anaphase II, are packaged 474 | 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES\ninto separate gametes. In the self-pollination of a Smooth x Wrinkled F pea example, the\n1\nSs diploid produces S and s gametes, not Ss gametes. The S and s are segregated into\nseparate gametes.\nThe previous lesson also tracked the joint inheritance of two genes on separate\nchromosomes that affect different traits (Smooth vs Wrinkled seeds and Yellow vs Green\nseeds), which leads to Mendel\u2019s Second Law \u2014 the Law of Independent Assortment. In\nmodern terms, this law roughly states that, during gamete formation, the allocation of the\nalleles of a gene on one chromosome is independent of the allocation of the alleles of\na different gene on a different (non-homologous) chromosome. So when gametes form\nfrom an SsYy F , and the gametes receive either S or s (as stated in the First Law of\n1\nSegregation), then whether Y goes with S to make up a SY gamete, or whether y goes with\nS to make up a Sy gamete, is completely by chance. This is also seen in the diagram of\nmeiosis and how the chromosomes divide at Anaphase I. Homologs separate at Anaphase\nI, and in the case of two different pairs of homologs, the way in which the first pair of\nhomologs splits doesn\u2019t influence how the second pair of homologs splits. What Mendel\ndiscovered by examining segregation ratios (the ratios of each genotype resulting from a\nparticular cross) can thus also be explained through the mechanics of meiosis. Mendel\u2019s\nthinking was revolutionary at the time, and a great example of thinking carefully about\nthe outcomes of an experiment and developing a model of the process that explains the\nobserved data.\nLinkage\nWatch this video for an explanation of linkage (7:47)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This situation is called\nlinkage. 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES | 475\nImagine a case in which the hypothetical gene \u201cA\u201d (with alleles \u201cA\u201d and \u201ca\u201c) and gene \u201cB\u201d\n(with alleles \u201cB\u201d and \u201cb\u201c) occur at loci near each other on the same chromosome. Imagine\nfurther that one of the chromosomes has the dominant \u201cA\u201d and the dominant \u201cB\u201d allele\nwhile its homolog has both recessive \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d alleles. This situation is illustrated below.\nWhen these chromosomes go through meiosis\nthe alleles at the two loci cannot independently\nassort because they are on the same\nchromosome \u2014 they are physically connected.\nAs a result, the gametes will be either AB or ab.\nThere will be no Ab or aB gametes, as you\nwould normally expect from independent\nassortment, because the A allele is physically\nattached to the B allele, and the a allele\nattached to the b allele \u2014 they are on the same\nchromosome.

The homolog that migrates to the right will have one\nchromatid that is Ab and another that is ab.\nThe frequency of crossing over is one way to describe the distance between the two genes\non the chromosome. If crossing over is very infrequent \u2014 in this example, if there are very\nfew Ab and aB gametes \u2014 the two genes must be very close to each other. This situation is\ncalled a tight linkage. If crossing over is quite frequent, approaching 50%, the two genes\nmust be very far apart. If it appears that AB, ab, Ab, and aB gametes have equal frequency,\nthis indicates that the genes are located on different chromosomes or are on the same\nchromosome, but separated so much that the frequency of crossing over is 50%, which\nhas the same result as if they were on separate chromosomes.\nThe Wikipedia site on linkage provides a bit of additional information.\nReview questions\n1.

You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1667#oembed-2\nRecall that inheritance does not always involve large, qualitative differences. Inheritance\nof small differences that require more meticulous measurement and are reported in\nquantitative terms such as seed yield in kg/ha, number of chloroplasts per mesophyll\ncell, and grape sucrose content are very important in horticulture. Indeed, these small\ndifferences, when accumulated, can be more important than the large qualitative\ndifferences in horticultural food crops. Quantitative traits result in higher yield, earlier\nmaturity, and greater cold tolerance, all of which, with patient intercrossing and persistent\nselection over many years, leads to continuous crop improvement.\nIn contrast to qualitative traits, the inheritance of quantitative traits may be influenced\nsubstantially by the environment. Recall the equation\nPhenotype = Genotype + Environment\nFor quantitative traits, the Genotype component, or the influence of each of these\nquantitative genes, is quite small, and the influence of the Environment can be large\nrelative to the contribution of Genotype.\nYou can visualize the difference between quantitative and qualitative inheritance by\nmeasuring a large set of plants of the same species (we\u2019ll call it a population of plants) for\na particular characteristic (we\u2019ll use flower number per plant as an example). Using that\ndata set containing flower numbers for a large number of plants, you can\n\u2022 count the number of plants in the population that have one flower,\n\u2022 count the number of plants with two flowers,\n\u2022 count the number of plants with three flowers, and so on, 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES | 479\nthen calculate the frequency of each of these flower number classes in the population\nby dividing the number of plants with one flower by the total number of plants in the\npopulation, and so on for each of your flower number classes.\nNext, you can make a graph plotting the flower number on the X axis against the\nfrequency of plants with that flower number on the Y axis, giving a figure called a\nfrequency distribution.\nAs an example, below are two databases containing hypothetical flower number data\ntaken on 60 plants in two different populations. The first table is a hypothetical database\nillustrating what the population structure might look like if flower number was controlled\nby quantitative inheritance, and the second illustrates what the population might look\nlike if flower number was controlled by qualitative inheritance. Both tables have three\ncolumns; the first shows the number of flowers, ranging from 1 to 15 per plant; the\nsecond shows the number of plants in the sample of 60 with the corresponding number of\nflowers; and the third shows the frequency of plants in the sample with the corresponding\nnumber of flowers per plant. In the quantitative database on the left, in the row\ncorresponding to plants with four flowers, read across to see that there were two of\nthese plants, and that their frequency was 2/60 = 0.0333, rounded to 0.03. This is called\na frequency distribution table because it shows the frequency of plants with a particular\nclass of a characteristic, in this case flower number per plant.\nNotice that the frequencies in the quantitative table are spread out over a wide range\nof flower numbers, with a peak around seven flowers per plant. In the qualitative table,\nin contrast, the frequencies are clustered around two discrete flower numbers, with one\nlarge peak at about five flowers and a smaller peak at 13. 480 | 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES\nQuantitative Qualitative\nexample example\n# #\n# Flowers Frequency # Flowers Frequency\nPlants Plants\n1 0 0 1 0 0\n2 0 0 2 0 0\n3 1 .02 3 0 0\n4 2 .03 4 3 .05\n5 5 .08 5 30 .50\n6 7 .12 6 9 .15\n7 16 .27 7 3 .05\n8 15 .25 8 0 0\n9 6 .10 9 0 0\n10 4 .07 10 0 0\n11 2 .03 11 1 .02\n12 2 .03 12 1 .02\n13 0 0 13 12 .20\n14 0 0 14 1 .02\n15 0 0 15 0 0\nTotal 60 1.0 Total 60 1.0\nThese data are easier to understand in a graph, with the flower number on the X axis and\nthe frequencies on the Y axis: 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES | 481\nImage credit: Tom Michaels\nNotice that the magenta line illustrating the qualitative inheritance distribution has two\npeaks at 5 and 13 flowers per plant, and that the dispersion around those peaks is quite\nnarrow. Most values are either 5 or 13. In contrast, the blue line illustrating quantitative\ninheritance has a peak in the 7\u20138 flower per plant region, and there is a great deal\nof dispersion. There are many different values of flowers per plant, although the most\nfrequent is in the 7\u20138 range.\nThe dispersion around the peaks is in part due to the influence of the environment. For\nqualitative traits (magenta line), this influence is small. For quantitative traits (blue line), it\nis larger. Also notice that if you added up the frequencies under the two magenta curves,\nyou would find that the curve with the peak at five flowers has three times the frequency\nof plants as the curve peaking at 13 plants. This 3:1 ratio is indicative of a single qualitative\ngene where the dominant allele is associated with, on average, five flowers per plant.\nReview questions 482 | 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES\n1. Would you expect that a frequency distribution with two sharp peaks represents a\nqualitative or quantitative trait?\n2. Would you expect that a frequency distribution which looks like a mound with one high\npoint represents a qualitative or quantitative trait?\n3. Would you expect that a frequency distribution with four sharp peaks represents a\nqualitative or quantitative trait? (hint: 9:3:3:1)\nHeritability\nWatch this video for an introduction to heritability (8:44)\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1667#oembed-3\nInheritance of quantitative traits is often associated with the term heritability. If a parent\nand its offspring have very similar values for a quantitative trait, the trait is considered\nto be highly heritable. Highly heritable traits tend to be under strong genetic control with\nlittle influence from the environment. In contrast, if the offspring values don\u2019t seem to\nhave any relationship to that of the parent, the trait is considered to have low heritability.\nLow heritability usually results when the influence of the environment is quite high\nrelative to the impact of the genotype on the trait being studied. If you are trying to\nimprove a plant characteristic through breeding, you\u2019ll have much greater gain from\nselection if the trait has high heritability rather than low heritability. If a plant\ncharacteristic has high heritability, dramatic changes to the population from natural\nselection will also be more rapid (require fewer generations) than for a characteristic that\nhas low heritability. See the graph below. 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES | 483\nImage credit: Tom Michaels\nThe X axis represents the number of flowers on the parent plant, while the Y axis\nrepresents the average number of flowers on the offspring of those parents. A dot\nrepresents each parent-offspring data pair. For example, the maroon dot with the black\narrow pointing to it represents a data point for a parent with 10 flowers whose offspring\nhad, on average, two flowers (read the 2 off the Y axis).\nThe gold dots represent cases where the trait has high heritability. Note that you can\ndraw a line with a positive slope through the gold dots, with the dots being relatively close\nto the line. This indicates high heritability, and means that the offspring\u2019s performance\ncan be predicted based on the performance of the parent. If the parent has a high\nflower number, the offspring will as well. Plant breeders can make selections with the\nexpectation that if they save seeds from superior plants, the offspring growing from those\nplants will exhibit the same superiority.\nThe maroon dots, in contrast, represent the situation of low or zero heritability, and have\nno line of good fit. Some parents with high flower numbers had offspring with low flower\nnumbers and others with high flower numbers had offspring with high numbers. You\ncan\u2019t predict the offspring flower numbers based on the parent flower numbers. This 484 | 14.3 LINKAGE AND INHERITANCE OF SMALL DIFFERENCES\nrepresents a nightmare for breeders. Some offspring of superior plants will be good as\nthe parents, others will be better, and others will be wildly inferior.\nReview questions\n1. Would a breeder anticipate making greater gain from selection for a trait that has high\nheritability or low heritability?\n2. If a characteristic is very heavily influenced by the environment and exhibits very little control\nby genotype, will the heritability be close to 0 (very low heritability) or close to 1 (very high\nheritability)? 14.4 PLANT BREEDING | 485\n14.4 PLANT BREEDING\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will:\n\u2022 Understand how to get started breeding two common ornamental and food species.\n\u2022 Know the purpose of emasculation when making hybridizations (crosses) between parents.\n\u2022 Recognize the difference that propagation method makes in a plant breeding program.\nOverview\nThis lesson presents examples of plant breeding of two common garden plants, rose and\ntomato. The strategies for the two plants differ because of how the final plant will be\npropagated. Roses are propagated asexually, while tomatoes are propagated by seed. For\nboth, breeding starts with a cross between two different plants (called a bi-parental cross).\nGeneral information about rose\nWatch this video for an introduction to breeding roses and identifying rose hips (1:49) 486 | 14.4 PLANT BREEDING\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1679#oembed-1\nPhoto by Eastfield College Microscopy Lab, Mesquite, TX, CC BY-NC.\nRose (genus Rosa with many species) is a perennial, mostly deciduous (they annually lose\ntheir leaves), mostly temperate-climate shrub in the Rosaceae family. The rose flower is\nperfect. The calyx, corolla, and androecium whorls are fused at their bases to form a small\ncup-shaped structure called a hypanthium that surrounds the ovary. (Refer to Chapter 8\nif these are not familiar terms.) The base of the hypanthium is attached to the receptacle.\nThe hypanthium is the structure that ripens into a bright red or red-orange fruit called\na \u201chip,\u201d recall that this is also the tissue that forms the fleshy part of the apple. Within\nthe hypanthium are hard achenes containing the rose seeds. In summary, the rose hip is 14.4 PLANT BREEDING | 487\nan accessory fruit (parts other than ovary wall constitute the fleshy ripe portion) and an\naggregate fruit (one flower, many carpels forming separate fruits) where the subsidiary\nfruits are achenes (optional).\nNevada rose. T. Kiya. CC BY-SA 2.0\nThe species of rose differ in their chromosome number, or ploidy. Roses have seven\ndifferent types of chromosomes, so the total number of chromosomes in a rose is\nnormally a multiple of seven. Some species, particularly wild species, are diploids with two\nsets of chromosomes, and so have a total of 14 (2 x 7 = 14) chromosomes. The large-\nflowered hybrid tea roses have four sets of chromosomes, so they are tetraploids with\n28 (4 x 7 = 28) chromosomes. There are even triploid roses with 21 chromosomes. This\noptional journal article by C\u00e9dric Grossi & Maurice Jay on Chromosomes studies of rose\ncultivars provides more information on chromosome numbers. Some roses are sterile\nbecause of triploidy or an imbalance in chromosome numbers, and never form rose hips.\nSterile roses cannot be used to breed new roses. From a practical standpoint, if the rose 488 | 14.4 PLANT BREEDING\nis fertile you can use it in backyard breeding without much concern about whether it is\ndiploid or tetraploid.\nRoses can self-pollinate or cross-pollinate. A breeding project should be started with a\ncross. Because the flowers are perfect, you need to emasculate (remove the anthers\nfrom) the flowers you intend to use as the female. Emasculation happens at the bud\nstage before the pollen has been released and before the stigma is receptive. If you wait\ntoo long, the pollen will be shed and the stigma may have received pollen from its own\nanthers. The commercial roses that you grow in your garden are normally the result of\ncross-pollination and are genetically highly heterozygous (the opposite of inbred), which in\nthis case refers to most of the loci of plant being in a heterozygous condition or having two\ndifferent alleles. High heterozygosity results in a more vigorous plant because the genome\nhas increased diversity. Roses are asexually propagated by rooting or grafting cuttings of\ndesirable plants so that superior genotypes are maintained and not broken up by meiotic\ncell division, as would happen through seed propagation.\nGeneral information about tomato\nTomato, Solanum lycopersicon, is a member of the Solenaceae family, the same family\nthat contains potato, pepper, tobacco, and nightshade. The crop has a fascinating history,\nstarting with its likely origin in Peru, importation to Europe with returning explorers,\ngradual introduction into European cuisine (some cultures associated tomato with\nnightshade and considered it poisonous), and introduction to North America. This\noptional tomato history page describes one version of this history. 14.4 PLANT BREEDING | 489\nTomato flower and fruit. \u00a9 Shutterstock. Adapted and labeled by Emily Tepe.\nThe tomato flower is perfect (in the botanical sense). The anthers form a cone that\ncompletely surrounds the gynoecium. In wild tomatoes, the stigma and style protrude\nup above the cone of anthers, so these wild types tend to cross-pollinate. The stigma of\ndomesticated tomatoes is either just slightly above the cone, or buried within the cone.\nDomesticated tomatoes self-pollinate, so we will also need to emasculate the female\nplants in our crosses. The pistil is made up of several fused carpels, and the mature fruit\nis a berry.\nIn contrast to rose, all tomatoes, whether wild or domesticated, are diploids where 2n\n= 24. They will all cross with each other. Domesticated tomatoes that you grow in your\ngarden are either highly homozygous (inbred) or are F hybrids and highly heterozygous.\n1\nHeirloom and older style tomatoes are typically inbreds (sometimes called pure lines or\n[incorrectly] open pollinated in seed catalogs), while modern and commercial tomatoes\nare F hybrids. You can use either heirloom or commercial hybrid types in your breeding\n1\nexperiments. Tomatoes are propagated by seeds. 490 | 14.4 PLANT BREEDING\nReview questions\n1. Compare and contrast rose and tomato for their ploidy and method of propagation.\n2. How does the variation in ploidy affect rose breeding? Does it have the same impact on\ntomato breeding?\n3. What is emasculation and why is it done? Which parent do you emasculate, or do you\nemasculate both parents?\nRose breeding\nThe overall strategy:\n\u2022 Identify your objective.\n\u2022 Choose your parents.\n\u2022 Make controlled crosses among parents.\n\u2022 Plant the F seeds.\n1\n\u2022 Evaluate the offspring over a few years.\n\u2022 Keep seeds from the best plants and compost the rest.\n\u2022 Asexually propagate the very best one or two by stem cuttings.\n\u2022 Sell the rights to your award-winning rose to a nursery who distributes it worldwide.\nYou should start a breeding project with an objective in mind. At first, your objective will\nprobably be just to see if the process works. Later, you will have specific characteristics\nin mind that you would like to emphasize in the progeny from the cross. Step two is to\nchoose your parents; at least one of the parents should have the trait you are interested in\n\u2014 like flower color, disease resistance, or cold hardiness for surviving Minnesota winters.\nThe other parent should have complementary traits, like size, branching, floral scent, or\nlong vase life.\nIn a rose, you might choose as the female a nice shrub rose with an attractive red flower\nand that has made it through several winters without special care. If it has nice full rose 14.4 PLANT BREEDING | 491\nhips at the end of the year, you know it\u2019s fertile. Perhaps you\u2019d like the new rose to have\nthe same flower type and color, but in a dwarf plant. And perhaps your neighbor has a\ndwarf rose that sets hips and must be fertile, and you can use some pollen from that rose\neven though you don\u2019t like the color of its flower. Hopefully, you\u2019ll get some offspring that\nshow the same red as your female, but in the dwarf growth habit. (You\u2019ll probably get\nsome sprawling, gangly rose plants with ugly flowers as well, but you can toss them in the\ncompost.)\nTry the cross in the opposite direction as well (switch which plant is male and which is\nfemale). This is called a reciprocal cross. Sometimes the cross is easier to make in one\n\u201cdirection\u201d (A x B vs B x A) than the other. When writing a pedigree for the cross, which\nshows the names of the two parents, remember to write the female first \u2014 cross A x B,\nfor instance, means plant A was the female. Breeders sometimes write the pedigree with\na slash (\u201c/\u201d) rather than an \u201cX:\u201d A/B.\nBy making several crosses that meet your objectives, you increase your chance of\nobtaining the specific combination of alleles for the specific traits. If a plant meets your\nobjectives it can be asexually propagated, not by seed, so that you keep the genotype\nintact in your propagules.\nRose hybridization\nThe main steps in crossing are:\n\u2022 Choose buds at the right stage.\n\u2022 Emasculate the female.\n\u2022 Collect pollen from the male.\n\u2022 Transfer pollen from anther of male to stigma of female.\n\u2022 Identify the cross with a tag.\n\u2022 Protect the carpel until the ovary begins to swell.\nRose hybridization is a sufficiently popular hobby among gardeners that there are\nwebsites with reasonably easy-to-follow instructions. This is a good example from a rose\nbreeding project (12:18 min). 492 | 14.4 PLANT BREEDING\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Once you think you have something you want to propagate, use stem cuttings\nto propagate the selected plant.\nRoses are a good example of a common garden plant you can hybridize. You germinate\nthe resulting seeds, evaluate the progeny, and then asexually propagate the plants you\nlike. It will take at least three years or more to identify plants that maintain the traits you\ndesire to continue through multiple years and environments.\nReview questions\n1. When making a cross, why is staging the flower development important for emasculation\nand pollination?\n2. In the cross MN5125 / ND163 which of the two parents do you emasculate?\n3. What is a reciprocal cross? 14.4 PLANT BREEDING | 493\nTomato breeding\nThe overall strategy:\n\u2022 Identify your objective.\n\u2022 Choose your parents.\n\u2022 Make controlled crosses among parents.\n\u2022 Plant the F seeds.\n1\n\u2022 Evaluate the offspring for the characteristics you are most interested in.\n\u2022 Keep the seed from the best plants and begin inbreeding.\n\u2022 Grow the seed from the best plants next spring or in a greenhouse.\n\u2022 Select the best plants, allow their flowers to self, and keep the seed.\n\u2022 Repeat the last two steps for about 5\u20137 generations. Notice that the progeny are\nnow very similar to each other.\n\u2022 Somewhere around year 5 or 6, identify the best plant that will be the founder of\nyour new, pure line (true breeding) tomato cultivar.\n\u2022 Sell the rights to your award-winning tomato to a seed company who distributes it\nworldwide.\nNotice that the rose and tomato strategy lists are not identical. With roses, we planted\nout the seeds from the hybridization, took a few years identifying the best plants, and\npropagated them asexually. With tomatoes, we want to develop pure lines by inbreeding.\nInbreeding is producing seed by selfing over 5\u20137 generations to develop plants that\nare highly homozygous at most loci in their genomes. Homozygosity results in identical\nplants propagated by seed. This is done so the resulting progeny look more and more\nalike until, after 4\u20136 years, plants grown from seeds harvested off the same plant are\nindistinguishable from each other. At that point you have an inbred pure line that will be\ntrue breeding if self-pollinated, and you can be pretty sure that you know what you\u2019re\ngoing to get when you plant seed from year to year. The seed from inbred pure lines are\nthe same because all loci are homozygous, so all gametes are the same and fertilization\nproduces clonal seeds.\nAgain, identify your objectives and then choose the parents. You might like the cherry\ntomato that you\u2019ve been growing on the patio because the fruits are perfect for salads.\nBut being a loyal Gopher, you\u2019d like a gold fruit rather than one that\u2019s Badger red. So you\nreciprocally cross the red patio tomato with the gold beefsteak type tomato and begin\nassessing progeny. 494 | 14.4 PLANT BREEDING\nTomato hybridization\n\u2022 Choose buds at the right stage.\n\u2022 Emasculate the female.\n\u2022 Collect pollen from the male.\n\u2022 Transfer pollen from anther of male to stigma of female.\n\u2022 Identify the cross with a tag.\n\u2022 Collect seed at maturity.\nThis is a practical video on crossing tomatoes (2:18 min).\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view\nthem online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/horticulture/?p=1679#oembed-3\nDehybridizing\nMost new commercial tomatoes, including new garden tomatoes, are F hybrids. The\n1\nseeds you plant in the field are the result of crossing two parents, as described above.\nBy planting the F hybrid, the grower capitalizes on the extra vigor associated with a\n1\nhighly heterozygous hybrid genotype. This website (optional) discusses hybrid tomatoes\nvs. saving the seed from the hybrid to plant. It\u2019s an interesting discussion, but remember\nthat science is a systematic study and requires replications, something you don\u2019t get from\nplanting seeds from a hybrid in a single year. If you collect seed from a hybrid tomato\nfruit, whether from a hybrid plant in your garden or a fruit from the grocery store, those\nseeds are F seeds. By planting those seeds out, selecting the most vigorous seedlings,\n2\nand later in the year keeping seeds from the plants with the best fruits, you are following\nthe same steps laid out in the tomato breeding section, except that you fast-forwarded\npast the crossing and F grow-out stage and went directly to the F . If you continue to\n1 2\ngrow out the seed and select the best plants for a few more years, you will end up with a\nstable variety of your own. This process is called dehybridizing because you are starting\nwith a hybrid, but after several generations of production, selection, and seed saving you\nare creating new pure lines from that hybrid. 14.4 PLANT BREEDING | 495\nThis approach will work well with hybrid tomatoes and hybrid peppers because they are\nnaturally self-pollinating. Garden catalogs will tell you whether the seed you are buying is\nhybrid. If you are getting your fruits from the store, you can count on them being hybrids\nunless they are marked as heirloom. The upside of dehybridizing is that it\u2019s the easiest way\nto breed your own crop because you don\u2019t have to emasculate and cross. The downside\nis that you are breeding \u201cblind.\u201d You didn\u2019t choose the parents for the F cross to achieve\n1\nyour objective, and you don\u2019t know the parents\u2019 characteristics, so the phenotypes that\nyou get from dehybridizing are anyone\u2019s guess.\nReview questions\n1. Why do you have to allow tomato to self-pollinate for several generations after you make\nthe hybridization?\n2. Why dehybridize? What type of crop (naturally inbreeding or naturally outcrossing) would\nyou be most likely to dehybridize?

CHAPTER 15: INVASIVE PLANTS AND GMOS | 499\nCHAPTER 15: INVASIVE PLANTS\nAND GMOS\nAlthough the discovery of DNA as the genetic material seems like a long time ago (~1928),\nplant genetic modification has been going on for thousands of years as farmers make\nselections of individuals to tailor crops to their needs. We continue manipulating plants in\nthe discipline of plant breeding. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are very recent,\nbut offer a new way to improve plants. Although GMO technology is controversial, it has\nbeen rapidly adopted by farmers.\nA short lesson on invasive plants introduces this issue and discusses how plant\npropagators can help. As consumers we must be aware of potential risks some plants\npose to the environment.\nLearning objectives\n\u2022 Define what GMO technology is and how it is applied to plant improvement.\n\u2022 Discuss why GMO technology is controversial and develop an informed opinion about it.\n\u2022 Know several examples of non-native invasive plants and their impact on the environment. 500 | CHAPTER 15: INVASIVE PLANTS AND GMOS 15.1 INVASIVE PLANTS | 501\n15.1 INVASIVE PLANTS\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this lesson you will:\n\u2022 Be able to explain the consequences of introducing non-native plants that become invasive.\n\u2022 Be able to map how some plants become invasive.\n\u2022 Know several examples of non-native invasive plants in Minnesota.\nOverview\nThis lesson introduces some of the features and impacts of non-native invasive plants,\nusing a Minnesota perspective. Be aware, however, that just as a plant native to an\nexotic continent may become a weedy invasive plant in Minnesota, some plants native\nto Minnesota have been taken to other continents and become invasive in their new\nhomes. Invasive plants are defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as those non-\nnative to an ecosystem whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or\nenvironmental harm or harm to human health. One example is the oriental bittersweet\n(Celasturs orbiculatus); the photo below shows, from near Red Wing, Minnesota, shows it\nsmothering ground and tree vegetation. 502 | 15.1 INVASIVE PLANTS\nBittersweet. Ross. CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\nInvasive plant species have contributed to the decline of about half of the endangered\nand threatened plant species in the U.S. Their impacts include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Competition with native plant species for moisture, sunlight, nutrients, and space.\n\u2022 Decrease in biodiversity.\n\u2022 Degradation of wildlife habitat, agriculture lands, and water quality.\n\u2022 Increase in soil erosion.\n\u2022 Decrease in recreational opportunities.\n\u2022 If sexually compatible native plants are present in the invaded regions, hybrids can\nform resulting in genetic contamination or pollution to native environments.\nThis lesson reviews some of the common features of invasive plants in Minnesota, and\nincludes specific information about several species. 15.1 INVASIVE PLANTS | 503\nWhere do invasive plants come from?\nPeople and plants have a close relationship, evolving a co-dependence over thousands\nof years. As people move around the globe they bring with them the plants that are\nuseful for fuel, food, feed for their animals, enhancing the aesthetics of their new home,\nand providing fiber for clothing and construction. While most of these plants have been\npositive forces in the lives of people and do relatively no harm, some escape from\ncultivation and become invasive. In Minnesota, for example, the most reported invasive\nplant is common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare). It was likely first brought to the U.S. by John\nWinthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony, about 400 years ago. Although\nhumans are a primary dispersal means for invasive plants and often move them\nintentionally, such plants may also arrive unintentionally as contaminants in food plants\nor as seed contaminants in fodder that travels with people and their animals.\nInvasion curve. US Government Accountability Office. Public domain.\nThe graph above shows the relationship between an invasive plant\u2019s spread and time.\nInitially, the spread is slow and is in a \u201clag phase\u201d due to the small number of plants in the\ninitial introduction. This lag phase (left third of the graph) is a period in which, if the plant 504 | 15.1 INVASIVE PLANTS\nis detected and addressed, control could result in its eradication. Most invasive plants,\nhowever, have a high rate of reproduction, either asexual or sexual. In many cases they\nspread by prolific fleshy fruit production (as with the bittersweet shown above) that is\neaten by birds and other animals. As numbers of the invasive plant increase, it enters the\nexponential rate of spread (middle third of the graph). Think of exponential spread as a\nrate similar to 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536. If left unchecked, as some invasive plants are, spread\nwill reach a maximum (shown in the last third of the graph). The horticultural industry is a\ncommon entry point for many invasive plants. The properties that make a plant attractive\nto growers and consumers for their yard or garden \u2014 including novelty, robust growth,\nabundant flowering over a long period of time, and easy sexual or asexual propagation\n\u2014 are the very qualities that make many ornamental introductions invasive.\nIn addition to large quantities of seed, invasive characteristics listed by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture\u2019s Invasive Plant website include:\n\u2022 Thriving on disturbed soil.\n\u2022 Distribution by birds, wind, or humans over great distances.\n\u2022 Aggressive root systems that spread long distances from a single plant.\n\u2022 Root systems that grow so densely that they smother the root systems of\nsurrounding vegetation.\n\u2022 Production of chemicals in leaves or root systems that inhibit the growth of other\nplants around them (referred to as allelopathy).\nAs invasive plants spread they displace native vegetation, and can dramatically impact the\necosystem into which they are introduced.\nReview questions\n1.

It is a woody vine that climbs\ntrees and structures and is capable of girdling the trees as the vines tighten around the\ntruck (right-hand photo). Girdling plus the accumulated growth of heavy vines can bring\ndown large trees.

(Remember that an \u201c\u00d7\u201d between the genus and specific epithet\nindicates an interspecific hybrid.) The knotweed was originally imported as a novel\nornamental. With its fast growth and late fall flowering it can make a very showy specimen\nplanting. Each taxa of knotweed has very rapid growth. As an herbaceous perennial it\nresumes growth from large rhizomes (an underground stem) that produce prolific shoots\nand adventitious roots, making it difficult to control with herbicides. 508 | 15.1 INVASIVE PLANTS\nJapanese knotweed.

GMOs are produced through genetic engineering, where a transgene\nfrom any organism is manipulated to produce a trait in a plant after it has been\nintroduced. Transgenes are DNA that are manipulated to function in a plant to produce a\nspecific trait. They can originate from any other organism, and the new DNA need not be\nintroduced through sexual reproduction as in making crosses for plant breeding. (In non-\nGMO crops, all genes originate from sexual reproduction.) As discussed in the chapter on\nDNA, the genetic code is the sequence of bases along a strand of DNA, and is universal\namong all living organisms, enabling the transfer of a gene from a bacteria, virus, or any\norganism to a plant. )A transfer of DNA across kingdoms would never occur by sexual\nreproduction, because interkingdom crosses cannot be made.) GMO technology offers,\nfor example, the possibility of engineering resistance to the corn rootworm by introducing\na bacterial transgene into corn or the ability to test a gene from any source in a plant.\nThis lesson offers insight into how GMOs offer a novel mechanism for plant improvement 514 | 15.2 GMOS\nthat can add significant traits to forestry, agronomy, and horticulture crops. Their\ncontributions include herbicide tolerance for improved weed control, resistance to insect\nand viral pests, and improved health benefits for crops.\nUnlike rose and apple breeding, in which hobbyists can breed new crops in their gardens,\nGMO technology integrates knowledge from genetics, molecular biology, and tissue\nculture to produce a new GMO crop. These skills would be difficult to combine in the\ngarden, but the plants that are produced are propagated identically to their conventional\ncounterparts. It would be difficult to distinguish the GMO \u201cInnate\u201d potato from a non-\nGMO potato, unless they were tested for browning, acrylamide production, or disease\nresistance. GMO potatoes look and behave like other potatoes. Adoption of GMO\ntechnology by a farmer requires no new equipment or cultivation techniques. 15.2 GMOS | 515\nWhat is a GMO?\nPapaya tree infected with Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV).. Scot Nelson. Public domain.\nGMOs begin where plant breeding ends. An excellent example of GMO technology\noccurred after the introduction of Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV) to Hawaii. PRSV\ndevastated papaya production to the where point growers could not produce a crop.\nAttempts to use plant breeding to produce a virus-resistant plant were unsuccessful.\nNo sexually compatible plant with resistance to PRSV could be located, so no amount\nof traditional plant breeding by crossing would produce resistance. This viral disease\nprevented papaya production in Hawaii until Dennis Gonsalves, of the US Department of\nAgriculture, adopted a GMO strategy that had previously been used to produce potatoes\nresistant to several viruses, and made papayas resistant to PRSV. Today, any papaya\nproduced in Hawaii is likely to be either \u201cSunUp\u201d or \u201cRainbow,\u201d the GMO cultivars. 516 | 15.2 GMOS\nAlthough the virus-resistant papaya seems like a win for growers and consumers, it is\nvery controversial. In the 1980s, the early development of GMO technology was tied to\nlarge agricultural companies that patented and used the technology in corn, soybeans,\nand cotton. Others see the \u201cunnatural\u201d movement of a gene from a bacteria to a plant as\na process that we should not use.\nThe GMO papaya is a good example for presenting the process involved in producing a\nGMO. A first step in developing GMO papaya was to understand the virus, its genome, and\nits replication. Virologists, those devoting their lives to the study of virus biology, knew that\nthe virus\u2019 genome had a gene encoding a coat protein that surrounded the virus\u2019 genetic\nmaterial and that was essential to its infection of plant cells. The GMO strategy added\na copy of the viral coat protein gene into the plant\u2019s chromosomes. The coat protein\nprotects the virus as it is transmitted from plant to plant, and is essential for replication.\nThe viral gene is engineered to be in the opposite orientation from its orientation in the\nvirus. This opposite orientation of the viral gene, now acting as plant gene, effectively\nshuts down viral replication before it can cause disease, making the plant resistant.\nJohn Sanford. FMSResearcher. CC BY-SA 4.0. Gene gun. Z33 House for Contemporary Art, Design & Architecture. CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nTo introduce the engineered viral gene into the plant\u2019s chromosome without crossing,\nhorticulturist John Sanford invented a means of introducing genes into plant cells by\nliterally shooting the gene into the nucleus of a cell. (John graduated in 1976 from the\nUniversity of Minnesota with a BS in horticulture, and continued in horticulture to become 15.2 GMOS | 517\na professor and researcher at Cornell University.) In this process, DNA of the gene of\ninterest is coated onto particles much smaller than the plant cell\u2019s nucleus. The gun works\noff of compressed air, similar to a BB gun. The particle coated with the DNA (gene of\ninterest), now in the nucleus, diffuses away from the particle and integrates into the\nplant\u2019s chromosome. The gene is then expressed and is hertible in the same qualitative\nmanner as other single gene traits. The process of introducing a transgene into a plant is\ncalled transformation. The plant cell or the whole plant carrying the engineered gene is\nsaid to be transformed or transgenic (synonyms for GMO).\nCould this process ever happen in nature?\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens is a bacterial plant\npathogen that produces crown gall disease. This\nbacterium transfers a small amount of its DNA\n(several genes) to the plant as part of its\npathogen attack. The photo to the left shows a\nlarge gall on a redwood that may have been\ncaused by Agrobacterium. The pathogen\u2019s genes\nhave been engineered through evolution to\ntake over the plant cell\u2019s normal regulation and\nproduce a gall \u2014 a callus of rapidly dividing\nundifferentiated cells similar to a callus. The\nintroduced bacterial genes, now functioning in\nthe gall or callus, produce compounds that feed\nthe Agrobacterium, which produces more pathogenic cells to infect other plants. This is\ncrown gall disease of plants. Biologists studying Agrobacterium\u2019s life cycle realized they\ncould use the natural DNA transfer process to introduce genes into plants by piggy-\nbacking a gene of interest from any organism onto the Agrobacterium\u2019s transfer process.\nThis has been very successful, and is the most used method of gene introduction into\nmany crops. Although the genes to produce a GMO virus-resistant papaya were\nintroduced with the gene gun, most of those in GMO crops were introduced using\nAgrobacterium. 518 | 15.2 GMOS\nDiagram of gene gun process. OpenStax. CC BY 4.0.\nThe gene gun (above) and Agrobacterium-mediated gene introductions are inefficient\nprocesses that introduce the gene into only a very small number of plant cells. Since\nonly a single cell receives the gene, plant tissue culture is used to regenerate an entire\nplant from that single cell. Plant tissue culture uses synthetic growth media to provide\nthe environment for mitotic cell divisions and organization of those cells into shoot and\nroot meristems. When the meristems are formed, the tiny plants can be removed from\ntissue culture and transferred to soil. This is possible because plant cells are totipotent\n\u2014 they can regenerate a whole plant from a single cell. (Think about about adventitious\nrooting, where parenchyma cells can divide and differentiate into a root meristem when\nburied in potting mix.) This capability has been identified in only a few plant species using\nvery specific components in the tissue culture medium to coax the cells to divide and\nregenerate a whole plant.\nAs in plant breeding, GMO plants must be assessed and selected for the traits of interest.\nIntroducing a single gene into a plant can produce a large phenotypic change \u2014 as in\nthe naturally occuring Shrunken-2 allele that transforms field corn to sweet corn, or the\nintroduction of the Papaya Ringspot Virus coat protein gene to provide virus resistance.\nIntroducing a new gene using GMO technology does not, however, change other genes or\ntraits of the plant\u2019s genome. Being able to maintain all of a cultivar\u2019s characteristics and\nadd a gene for resistance from any organism is a major advantage of GMO technology.\nThe art of GMO technology is discovering how non-plant organisms (virus, bacteria, fungi,\ninsects, and so on) might contribute a gene to improve a plant, be it through weed\ncontrol, increased nutrition in foods, or resistance to pests or viruses. GMO crops are\nproduced by interdisciplinary teams with members expert in gene identification, gene\nengineering, plant breeding, gene introduction, and tissue culture. These skills mimic the\nsteps required for GMO technology: identifying a gene or genes and their source to solve a 15.2 GMOS | 519\nproblem, engineering the gene for plant expression, using the gene gun or A. tumefaciens\nto introduce into the crop of interest, and assessing the new plant. It is possible that\nthe predicted gene action may not occur and that other genes or gene modifications are\nnecessary. All genes used in crop production today have been through several iterations\nthat improved the outcome after introduction. When a plant has the introduced gene\nintegrated into its chromosomes, it can be crossed with other plants to move the new\ngene and its traits into other varieties.\nReview questions\n1. What is a GMO?\n2. What are the two significant advantages of GMO technologies over traditional plant\nbreeding?\n3. What are the differences between the two processes used to introduce a novel gene into a\nplant?\n4. Can a GMO seed, seedling, or mature plant be distinguished from a non-GMO one just by\nlooking at it? What distinguishes the two, either visibly or genetically?\n5. Where do transgenes come from and how are they introduced into a GMO crop?\nWhy do farmers pay extra for GMO seeds?\nGMO technology has been rapidly adopted by farmers in the US and worldwide (the graph\nbelow shows adoption rates for the US in 1996\u20132018). In the US, corn, soybean, and sugar\nbeet crops are GMO for herbicide tolerance (which allows for improved weed control),\ninsect-resistant GMO cotton is extensively adopted to prevent boll weevil damage. For a\nmore comprehensive list of crops and GMO traits, see the GM Approval Database from\nthe ISAAA. 520 | 15.2 GMOS\nAs it implies, the \u201capproval\u201d in the name of this database indicates that GMO crops must\ngo through extensive testing and a review process before being allowed into production\nand into our food stream. The rapid adoption of GMO technology triggered questions\nof risks that resulted in a review process for all GMO crops by the US Department of\nAgriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe overwhelming scientific evidence indicates GMO crops are safe for the environment\nand for humans. To read more (optional) on the safety of GMO technology, see the\nAcademics Review\u2019s site on Genetic Roulette for science-based information and critical\nreview of GMO technology risks.\nGMO crops have economic, environmental, and convenience advantages for farmers.\nSeveral economic analyses have shown that increased yields from GMO crops are a major\nimpetus for adoption by farmers, even though GMO seeds cost more than conventional\nseeds. A good example is the rapid adoption of GMO sugar beets that were modified for\nresistance to the non-selective herbicide Roundup. This allowed the beets to be sprayed 15.2 GMOS | 521\nwith Roundup, killing weeds in the field and leaving the beets unharmed. A 2008 survey\nof GMO sugar beet growers showed the highest weed control ratings in the history of the\nsurvey and the near elimination of mechanical and manual weeding. Weed control had\npreviously been inefficient, requiring herbicide and mechanical controls. Making beets\nherbicide tolerant increased yield and made weed control convenient. Adoption was\ngreater than 90% one year after the GMO herbicide tolerant seed was made available.\nThe most significant environmental benefits of GMO technology come from GMO insect\nresistance. Most insecticides are non-specific, killing beneficial insects as well as the pest,\nand are toxic to humans, birds, fish, and other organisms. The basis of GMO resistance is\nthe introduction of the Bacillus thuringiensis gene, Bt, into the plant, so the plant produces\nBt. You may have heard of Bt as an insect control used in organic food production or\nmosquito control. Bt has a very low environmental impact because it is highly specific for\nthe target insect, unlike conventional insecticides that can have wide ranging collateral\ndamage when applied. Bt is also very labile, breaking down rapidly in the soil. The Bt\ngene from B. thuringiensis has been introduced into several crops. Currently, Bt crops\ninclude corn (field and sweet), cotton, potato, eggplant, tobacco, and soybean for control\nof several insect pests. Each crop has a specific Bt that targets the insect pest in that crop.\nWhere the GMO crop is grown in place of conventional crops, insecticide applications\nhave been greatly reduced. The battle continues, however, as insects develop resistance\nto Bt, leaving the crop susceptible to insect damage.\nAlthough using GMO technology requires a significant investment to develop a crop,\npropagation and use by a farmer is identical to that of conventional counterparts. The\nsimplicity and effectiveness of GMO crops has accelerated their adoption by farmers.\nGMO herbicide tolerance, for example, allows for a single post-germination application\nthat provides improved weed control, eliminating the need to apply several different\nherbicides at different times and to use mechanical weed removal. This single application\nreduces fuel cost for farmers, reduces carbon emission, and provides excellent weed\ncontrol. It is called herbicide tolerance because genes are introduced into the crop to\nmake it tolerant (resistant) to a specific herbicide that kills weeds. The convenience to the\nfarmer comes from using a single herbicide with flexible timing of application to the crop. 522 | 15.2 GMOS\nReview questions\n1. What advantages does a GMO crop present to a farmer?\n2. Do any of the advantages of a GMO crop for a farmer translate to advantages to the\nconsumer?\n3. Why were GMO crops adopted so rapidly by farmers?\n4. What are two examples of GMO crops that were rapidly adopted?\n5. What does a farmer need to do to adopt a GMO crop with insect resistance?\nGMO crops benefiting human health\nEarly in the technology\u2019s development, most GMO work focused on the farmer and/or\non production problems. Herbicide tolerance, insecticide resistance, and virus resistance\neach protected the crop or made farming easier. There are now, however, several GMO\ncrops developed primarily for the consumer. The iconic, increased-nutrition GMO crop\nis Golden Rice. It contains introduced genes that synthesize carotene in the endosperm.\nYou can easily distinguish Golden Rice from conventional rice by its yellow color from\nthe accumulated carotene, the same pigment found in carrots (see photo below). When\nhumans consume the carotene in Golden Rice, it is converted to vitamin A, an essential\nvitamin for human health. Conventional milled-rice contains no vitamin A, which results\nin vitamin A deficiencies in millions of adults and children who consume most of their\ncalories by eating rice. The Golden Rice Project estimates the number of child deaths\ncaused by vitamin A deficiency at 1.15 million/year. Vitamin A deficiency also causes\nloss of sight, increased susceptibility to a number of diseases, and reduced intellectual\ndevelopment. While Golden Rice would greatly mitigate the problem and has been\ncrossed into many regional cultivars, adoption has been slowed or blocked by anti-GMO\norganizations. Research continues with the development of golden bananas and cassava. 15.2 GMOS | 523\nGolden Rice grain compared to white rice grain in screenhouse of Golden Rice plants.

CC BY 2.0.\nA recently approved GMO crop for production, the \u201cInnate\u201d potato has introduced genes\nthat reduce the production of the neurotoxin acrylamide. Acrylamide forms in many\ncooked foods from the reaction of amino acids, sugars, and heat. The risk of consuming\nacrylamide is somewhat controversial, but the fact that it is a neurotoxin makes this\nan important improvement to the potato. The \u201cInnate\u201d potato has two other introduced\ngenes that make it resistant to the potato blight fungus and prevents browning of the\ntuber after being cut or bruised. It remains to be seen whether this potato is accepted\nby consumers and the fast food industry, where many potatoes are consumed. One of\nthe first GMO crops marketed was the \u201cNew Leaf\u201d potato, which had both insect and\nvirus resistance. Consumers and the fast food industry, led by anti-GMO organizations,\nmounted a campaign of GMO fear that effectively ended cultivation of this potato. The\n\u201cInnate\u201d potato reopens the discussion of GMO foods. 524 | 15.2 GMOS\nReview questions\n1. What are the differences in traits that benefit the farmer vs. benefiting consumers?\n2. What human health issues can be addressed using GMO technology?\nWhy are GMOs controversial?\nMarch Against Monsanto in Lethbridge Alberta. John Novotny. CC BY 2.0.\nThe overwhelming evidence from peer-reviewed science is that GMO crops are safe for\ngrowers, consumers, and the environment. There are several anti-GMO organizations 15.2 GMOS | 525\nthat have been effective in sensationalizing concerns and controversy concerning GMO\ntechnology. The first concern about GMOs is that the technology is not natural. A gene\nfrom a bacteria would have slim chances of integrating into a plant\u2019s chromosome without\ntechnology intervening \u2014 or would it? Concerns have been raised about genetic pollution,\nwhere genes from GMO crops would escape to conventional crops or weedy relatives,\nproducing superweeds. The second leading cause of controversy is that several large\nchemical and agricultural companies invested heavily in GMO technology, and then\nproduced the first GMO crops. GMO technology was patented by these large companies,\nincreasing concerns due to the environmental records of these companies. The lack of a\nfederal requirement to label foods as GMO also fanned fears of potential risks.\nOther concerns have originated in the technical nature and rapid development of GMOs,\nwhich many argue prevented a full assessment of risk. Arguments centered around a new\ntechnology\u2019s potential to have unintended or unknown consequences. Some speculated\non the possibility that the introduced genes could lead to the production of toxins,\nallergens, or carcinogens, despite thorough testing for these compounds in the review\nprocess. Adding to these concerns was the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s decision to not\nrequire labeling of food from or containing GMO plants. Additionally, growers\u2019 concerns\nled to the rejection of GMO crops in certified organic production. Each of these issues has\nbeen amplified by anti-GMO organizations such as the Non-GMO Project, the Center for\nFood Safety, and Greenpeace. The message from these organizations was and continues\nto be that GMO foods are unsafe for people and the environment, despite the\noverwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary. This is the partial story of the\ndevelopment and adoption and controversy of GMO crops.
