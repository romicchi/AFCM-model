THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE\nGeneral Truths:\n\u201cGeneral Truths\u201d by Virginia McHardy, licensed under CC BY 4.0.\nGeneral truths can include facts or something that exists and is always true. These\ncan be scientific facts, preferences, likes, dislikes, descriptions, or general states, for\ninstance. Some examples are:\n\u2022 I like pizza.\n\u2022 I don\u2019t like coffee.\n\u2022 Erin works really hard.\n\u2022 The sun rises in the east.\n\u2022 That store doesn\u2019t open early in the morning.\n\u2022 He has brown hair and brown eyes.\n\u2022 She owns a car.\nActions Happening at the Moment:\n\u201cActions happening at the moment\u201d by Virginia McHardy, licensed under CC BY 4.0.\nWe usually use the Present Continuous Tense when we want to express actions happening at the\nmoment. However, some verbs cannot be put in a continuous tense, so they are called stative\nverbs. Stative verbs include verbs like feel, understand, have, etc. This is when we use The Simple\nPresent Tense. Some examples are:\n\u2022 I have a headache at the moment. 2. THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE | 13\n\u2022 I see my teacher at the water fountain.\n\u2022 He feels jealous.\n\u2022 I don\u2019t understand this lesson.\n\u2022 She doesn\u2019t appear happy right now.\nBelow are some examples of stative verbs:\n\u201cStative Verbs\u201d by Annapurna Madhuri, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\nRoutines, Habits, and Schedules:\n\u201cRoutines, Habits and Schedules\u201d by Virginia McHardy, licensed under CC BY 4.0.\nThe Simple Present Tense is used to express regular habits, routines, schedules, and repeated\nactions. Some examples are:\n\u2022 I take a shower every morning.\n\u2022 I turn off all the lights before I leave the house.\n\u2022 Samir plays basketball on Saturday afternoons.\n\u2022 We visit the dentist twice a year.\n\u2022 The class doesn\u2019t meet on Wednesdays.\n\u2022 I don\u2019t watch TV in the evening. 14 | 2. THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE\nWith this function, frequency adverbs can be used, including always, never, sometimes, usually,\noften, rarely, hardly ever, etc. These adverbs come before the main verb, or after the verb \u201cto be\u201d.\nSome examples are:\n\u2022 I usually wake up at 7am.\n\u2022 I don\u2019t often have a cup of coffee in the afternoon.\n\u2022 They rarely visit us in the winter.\n\u2022 He is never late to class in the mornings.\nFuture Appointments or Schedules:\n\u201cFuture Appointments or Schedules\u201d by Virginia McHardy, licensed under CC BY 4.0.\nWe sometimes use The Simple Present Tense for future appointments or meetings.
