This book has a Creative Commons Attribution license, which allows\nreuse, revision, and redistribution so long as the original creator is attributed (please see the licensing\ninformation for this book for more information).\nIn addition to saving students money, an open textbook can be revised to be better contextualized\nto one\u2019s own teaching. In a recent study of undergraduate students in an introductory level physics\ncourse, students reported that the thing they most appreciated about the open textbook used in that\ncourse was that it was customized to fit the course, followed very closely by the fact that it was free\nof cost (Hendricks, Reinsberg, and Rieger 2017). For example, in an open textbook one may add in\nexamples more relevant to one\u2019s own context or the topic of a course, or embedded slides, videos, or\nother resources. Note from the licensing information for this book that one must clarify in such cases\nthat the book is an adaptation.\nA number of commercial publishers offer relatively inexpensive digital textbooks (whether on their\nown or available through an access code that students must pay to purchase), but these may have\ncertain limitations and other issues:\n\u2022 Access for students is often limited to a short period of time;\n\u2022 Students cannot buy used copies from others, nor sell their own copies to others, to save\nmoney;\n\u2022 Depending on the platform, there may be limits to how students can interact with and take\nnotes on the books (and they may not be able to export their notes outside the book, so lose\naccess to those as well when they lose access to the book).\nNone of these is the case with open textbooks like the Introduction to Philosophy series. Students can\ndownload any book in this series and keep it for as long as they wish. They can interact with it in\nmultiple formats: on the web; as editable word processing formats; offline as PDF, EPUB; as a physical\nprint book, and more.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND VII See the next section, \u201cHow to Access and Use the Books,\u201d for more information on what the open\nlicense on this book allows, and how to properly attribute the work when reusing, redistributing, or\nadapting.\nVIII WHATISANOPENTEXTBOOK HOW TO ACCESS AND USE THE BOOKS\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS\nWe hope the books (or chapters in the books) will be adopted for introductory-level courses in\nphilosophy, as part of required readings. You may use the books as they are, or create adaptations or\nancillaries. One of the important benefits of the Introduction to Philosophy series is that instructors can\nmix and match chapters from various books to make their own customized set of readings for their\ncourses.\nBe sure to read the licensing information carefully and attribute the chapters or book properly when\nreusing, redistributing, or adapting.\nEach book can be read online, and is also downloadable in multiple formats, from their respective\nbook home pages on the Rebus Press site (e.g., Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind).\n\u2022 The .odt format can be opened by Open Office, Libre Office, or Microsoft Word. Note that\nthere may be some issues with formatting on this format, and hyperlinks may not appear if\nopened with MS Word.\n\u2022 The PDF files can be edited with Adobe Acrobat (the full program, not just the Reader) or\nprinted out. The print version of the PDF does not have hyperlinks.\n\u2022 The EPUB and MOBI files can be loaded onto digital reading platforms like Adobe Digital\nEditions, Apple Books, and Kindle. They can also be edited using Pressbooks or tools like\nCalibre.\n\u2022 Edits can be made using the XHTML format or via the Pressbooks XML format (for easier\nadaptation in Pressbooks).\n\u2022 The book is also available for download as a Common Cartridge 1.1 file (with web links) for\nimport into your learning management system (see instructions for importing Common\nCartridge files, from the Pressbooks User Guide).\nThe multiple editable formats allow instructors to adapt the books as needed to fit their contexts.\nAnother way to create adaptations is to involve students in contributing to open textbooks. Students\nmay add new sections to an adapted book, link to other resources, create discussion questions or quiz\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND IX questions, and more. Please see Rebus Community\u2019s A Guide to Making Open Textbooks with Students\nfor more information and ideas.\nIf you plan to use or adapt one or more books (or chapters), we\u2019d love to hear about it! Please let us\nknow on the Rebus Community platform, and also on our adoption form.\nAnd if you have feedback or suggestions about the book, we would really appreciate those as well. We\nhave a separate form for keeping track of issues with digital accessibility, so please let us know if you\nfind any.\nX HOWTOUSE INTRODUCTION TO THE SERIES\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS\nThis book is part of the Introduction to Philosophy open textbook series, a set of nine (and counting?)\nopen access textbooks that are designed to be used for introductory-level, survey courses in\nphilosophy at the post-secondary level.\nOVERVIEW OF THE SERIES\nThis set of books is meant to provide an introduction to some of the major topic areas often covered\nin introductory-level philosophy courses. I have found in teaching students new to philosophy that\nmany struggle with the new ideas, questions, and approaches they find in introductory courses in\nphilosophy, and that it can be helpful to provide them with texts that explain these in relatively\nstraightforward terms.\nWhen I began this project there were few textbooks that I was happy enough with to ask students to\npurchase, and even fewer openly licensed textbooks that I could pick and choose chapters from, or\nrevise, to suit my courses. This series was created out of a desire to provide such resources that can be\ncustomized to fit different contexts and updated by instructors when needed (rather than waiting for\nan updated version from a publisher).\nEach book is designed to be accessible to students who have little to no background in philosophy, by\neither eliminating jargon or providing a glossary for specialized philosophical terms. Many chapters\nin the books provide examples that apply philosophical questions or concepts to concrete objects or\nexperiences that, we hope, many students are familiar with. Questions for reflection and discussion\naccompany chapters in most of the books, to support students in understanding what to focus on as\nthey are reading.\nThe chapters in the books provide a broad overview of some of the main discussions and debates in\nthe philosophical literature within a topic area, from the perspective of the chapter authors. Some\nof the chapters focus on historical approaches and debates, such as ancient theories of aesthetics,\nsubstance dualism in Descartes, or classical utilitarian versus Kantian approaches in ethics. Others\nintroduce students to questions and topics in the philosophical literature from just the last few\ndecades.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND XI The books currently in production for the series are:\n\u2022 Aesthetic Theory and Practice (Ed. Valery Vino): chapters include ancient aesthetics; beauty in art\nand nature; the nature of art; art and emotions; art and morality; aesthetics and politics\n\u2022 Epistemology (Ed. Brian Barnett): chapters include epistemic justification; sources of\nknowledge; skepticism; epistemic value, duty, and virtue; epistemology, probability, and\nscience; social epistemology; feminist epistemologies\n\u2022 Ethics (Ed. George Matthews): chapters include ethical relativism; divine command theory and\nnatural law; ethical egoism and social contract theory; virtue ethics; utilitarianism; Kantian\nDeontology; feminist ethics; evolutionary ethics\n\u2022 Logic (Ed. Benjamin Martin): chapters include what is logic?; evaluating arguments; formal\nlogic; informal fallacies; necessary and sufficient conditions\n\u2022 Metaphysics (Ed. Adriano Palma): chapters include universals; finitism, infinitism, monism,\ndualism, pluralism; the possibility of free action; experimental metaphysics\n\u2022 Philosophy of Mind (Ed. Heather Salazar): chapters include Descartes and substance dualism;\nbehaviourism and materialism; functionalism; qualia; freedom of the will\n\u2022 Philosophy of Religion (Ed. Beau Branson): chapters include arguments for belief in God;\nreasons not to believe; arguments against belief from the cognitive science of religion; from\nphilosophy of (mono)theism to philosophy of religions\n\u2022 Philosophy of Science (Ed. Eran Asoulin): chapters include empiricism; Popper\u2019s conjectures and\nrefutations; Kuhn\u2019s normal and revolutionary science; the sociology of scientific knowledge;\nfeminism and the philosophy of science; the problem of induction; explanation\n\u2022 Social and Political Philosophy (Eds. Sam Rocha and Douglas Giles): chapters include the ideal\nsociety; the state of nature and the modern state; human rights, liberty, and social justice;\nradical social theories\nWe envision the books as helping to orient students within the topic areas covered by the chapters, as\nwell as to introduce them to influential philosophical questions and approaches in an accessible way.\nThe books may be used for course readings on their own, or in conjunction with primary source texts\nby the philosophers discussed in the chapters. We aim thereby to both save students money and to\nprovide a relatively easy route for instructors to customize and update the resources as needed. And\nwe hope that future adaptations will be shared back with the rest of the philosophical community!\nHOW THE BOOKS WERE PRODUCED\nContributors to this series have been crowdsourced through email lists, social media, and other\nmeans. Each of the books has its own editor, and multiple authors from different parts of the world\nwho have expertise in the topic of the book. This also means that there will inevitably be shifts in\nvoice and tone between chapters, as well as in perspectives. This itself exemplifies the practice of\nphilosophy, insofar as the philosophical questions worth discussing are those that do not yet have\nsettled answers, and towards which there are multiple approaches worthy of consideration (which\nmust, of course, provide arguments to support their claim to such worth).\nXII SERIESINTRODUCTION I have been thrilled with the significant interest these books have generated, such that so many people\nhave been willing to volunteer their time to contribute to them and ensure their quality\u2014not only\nthrough careful writing and editing, but also through extensive feedback and review. Each book in\nthe series has between five and ten authors, plus an editor and peer reviewers. It\u2019s exciting to see so\nmany philosophers willing to contribute to a project devoted to helping students save money and\ninstructors customize their textbooks!\nThe book editors, each with expertise in the field of the book they have edited, have done the bulk of\nthe work for the books. They created outlines of chapters that were then peer reviewed and revised\naccordingly, and they selected authors for each of the chapters. The book editors worked with authors\nto develop a general approach to each chapter, and coordinated timelines for their completion.\nChapters were reviewed by the editors both before and after the books went out for peer review, and\nthe editors ensured revisions occurred where needed. They have also written introductions to their\nbooks, and in some cases other chapters as well. As the subject experts for the books, they have had\nthe greatest influence on the content of each book.\nMy role as series editor started by envisioning the project as a whole and discussing what it might\nlook like with a significant number of philosophers who contributed to shaping it early on. Overall, I\nhave worked the Rebus Community on project management, such as developing author and reviewer\nguidelines and other workflows, coordinating with the book editors to ensure common approaches\nacross the books, sending out calls for contributors to recruit new participants, and updating the\ncommunity on the status of the project through the Rebus Community platform. I have reviewed\nthe books, along with peer reviewers, from the perspective of both a philosopher who teaches\nintroductory-level courses and a reader who is not an expert in many of the fields the books cover.\nAs the books near publication, I have coordinated copy editing and importing into the Pressbooks\npublishing platform (troubleshooting where needed along the way).\nFinally, after publication of the books I and the book editors will be working on spreading the word\nabout them and encouraging adoption. I plan to use chapters from a few of the books in my own\nIntroduction to Philosophy courses, and hope to see many more adoptions to come.\nThis project has been multiple years in the making, and we hope the fruits of our many labours are\ntaken up in philosophy courses!\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND XIII PRAISE FOR THE BOOK\nADRIANO PALMA\nIn a breezy introduction to the philosophy of mind edited by Heather Salazar, the beginner reader\nis immersed in an easy way into issues that are not otherwise easy to grasp, such as why one must\ninterpret differently \u201ctaking the child back to the zoo\u201d and \u201ctaking the car back to the zoo,\u201d and what\nmakes it very hard to tell a vegetarian what octopus salad tastes like.\nAll the same, the reader gets the right glimpse of why, centuries after they were written, the ideas of\nDescartes and Hobbes are relevant to the presence of zombies among us, or the scary prospect that\nthe arguments to the effect that we are the zombies are correct.\nAn excellent way to start a class on the philosophy of mind, without being bogged down from the get\ngo into the synapses that got away.\n\u2014 Adriano Palma, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa\nIntroduction to Philosophy: Philosophy of Mind achieves the two most important aspects of an\nintroductory-level textbook: accessibility and presentation of philosophy as inquisitive problems to\nbe explored. I can tell that the authors of the various chapters have kept their audience in mind. They\nare writing for intelligent yet beginning students, and avoid burying us in jargon or an academic-\npedantic style. The content is substantial enough as a secondary-source guide for new philosophy\nmajors. Concurrently, the writing is inviting and approachable enough for non-philosophy majors\nwho will take that one philosophy course as an elective. Most of my students fit the latter description,\nand this book will serve them well.\nI plan to use the first three chapters, and parts of the other chapters, in assembling material for my\nstandard \u201cIntro\u201d course. Thank you for putting the effort and care into a quality OER book.\n\u2014 Thomas Herrnstein, Northwest Arkansas Community College, U.S.A.\nXIV PHILOSOPHYOFMIND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nHEATHER SALAZAR AND CHRISTINA HENDRICKS\nHEATHER SALAZAR, BOOK EDITOR\nEveryone who worked on this book generously donated their time and expertise to ensure that\nstudents in philosophy of mind have an engaging and well-researched contemporary introduction\nthat is freely accessible.\nThis book is a part of a series that was envisioned by Christina Hendricks. Her foresight, flexibility,\nand cooperation were essential in bringing this book to fruition. Apurva Ashok, our project manager\nfor the series at the Rebus Foundation, was indispensable. She kindly supported us in our vision and\npromptly answered all of my questions. I could not have asked for a more responsive publisher. I was\npleased that my own artwork was chosen for the cover and Jonathan Lashley, who designed the cover,\nmade it look striking and modern. Our book was peer-reviewed by Adriano Palma, who made astute\nobservations and enabled us to edit the chapters quickly and confidently.\nFinally, many thanks to the contributors to this volume. Our chapters are written by excellent scholars\nwho worked through revisions as responsibly as they would have had they contributed to a standard\ntextbook. The result is an introduction to philosophy of mind that instructors can confidently use in\ntheir classes.\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS, SERIES EDITOR\nI would like to thank the authors in this book for their patience as we worked through the process\nof conceiving the book and getting it to publication. Because this is the first book to be published\nin the Introduction to Philosophy open textbook series, we were sometimes creating processes and\nworkflows as we went along, and this meant things may have taken longer than anyone expected at\nfirst!\nI would also like to thank Adriano Palma for his careful peer review of the chapters in this book. (And\nsneak preview, he is also an editor for another book in the series, Introduction to Metaphysics!)\nSpecial thanks to Heather Salazar for her excellent and attentive work in editing this book. She\nhas been eminently flexible as we worked through the kinks of getting the first book in the series\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND XV published, and unfailingly patient as I faced the realization of just how many time-consuming steps\nwere needed for that to happen. I am also thrilled that she agreed to provide one of her original\nartworks for the cover, which fits the book perfectly.\nSpeaking of the cover, I met Jonathan Lashley when we were both OER Research Fellows with the\nOpen Education Group, and I didn\u2019t realize he had design talent until he saw one of my messages on\nsocial media and volunteered to help. I was floored by the designs he created for the book series, and\nit was very difficult to choose just one among the beautiful options he drafted. The book covers are\nexceptionally well done, and really bring the series together as a whole.\nIn the last weeks before publication, Colleen Cressman stepped in to provide much-needed help with\ncopyediting. I am very grateful for her thorough and detailed efforts, and for the suggestions she made\nto help make the chapters as accessible as possible for introductory-level students. At the same time,\nNate Angell contributed his expertise with the Pressbooks platform and did a wonderful job inputting\nmany, many google documents into Pressbooks and formatting the content so that it looks and reads\nwell. I particularly appreciated his help with importing LaTeX code into Pressbooks for one of the\nchapters, which is something it would have taken me a long time to figure out how to do!\nWhen I started this project there were many discussions amongst philosophers from various parts\nof the world on the Rebus Community platform, and their ideas and suggestions contributed\nsignificantly to the final products. There were also numerous people who gave comments on draft\nchapter outlines for each book. Thank you to the many unnamed philosophers who have contributed\nto the book in these and other ways!\nThis book series would not have gotten beyond the idea stage were it not for the support of the Rebus\nCommunity. I want to thank Hugh McGuire for believing in the project enough to support what we\nboth realized at the time was probably much bigger than even our apprehensions about its enormity.\nZoe Wake Hyde was instrumental in getting the project started, particularly in helping us develop\nworkflows and documentation. And I\u2019m not sure I can ever thank Apurva Ashok enough for being an\nunfailingly enthusiastic and patient supporter and guide for more months than I care to count. She\nspent a good deal of time working with me and the book editors to figure out how to make a project\nlike this work on a day-to-day level, and taught me a great deal about the open publishing process.\nApurva kept me on track when I would sometimes drop the ball or get behind on this off-the-side-of-\nmy-desk project. She is one of the best collaborative partners I have never (yet!) met in person.\nFinally, I want to thank my family for understanding how important this work is and why I have\nchosen to stay up late so many nights to do it. And for their patience on the many groggy, pre-coffee\nmornings that followed.\nXVI ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK\nHEATHER SALAZAR\nThe main questions in the philosophy of mind are derived from puzzles involving trying to develop a\ncoherent theory of the nature and functions of the mind. Beginning with the nature of the mind, they\ninclude: Are minds separate from bodies or is the mind really just the body? If the mind is immaterial\nand the body material, how do they interact? How can this fit in with science? If the mind is just\nthe body, then how is consciousness explained? How can we have experiences or free will to think\nand act? How can we explain the special relationship we seem to have with knowing our own mental\nstates?\nThere are two major views in the philosophy of mind that arise from trying to describe the nature of\nour minds. One claims that our minds are different in nature and separate from our bodies and the\nother claims that our minds really are just physical, or a part of our bodies and the rest of the purely\nphysical world. These mark the two extremes. The first is called \u201csubstance dualism\u201d or \u201cCartesian\ndualism\u201d after Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who originated the primary arguments and the general view. The\nother is called \u201cphysicalism\u201d and was in the modern era associated most with Thomas Hobbes. Both\nphilosophers were trying to make sense of the mind within the modern context of science within the\nlatter part of the seventeenth century. Philosophy of mind was not yet a separate discipline and fell\nunder metaphysics as these philosophers studied it, but this time period, called the modern period,\nmarks the beginning of what we consider now to be investigations into the philosophy of mind. It was\na period of great scientific advancement and marked the beginning of the discipline of psychology, as\nwell.\nWhereas substance or Cartesian dualism has a difficult time making sense in a scientific context,\neliminative or reductive physicalism\u2014which completely reduces or eliminates the mind to\nmatter\u2014has a difficult time making sense of the functions of our mind. Substance or Cartesian\ndualism (Chapter 1) and reductive or eliminative physicalism (Chapter 2) are two extremes in the\nphilosophy of mind. These two theories have been largely replaced by views that are more\ncompromising in nature within the past century when philosophy of mind as a discipline of its own\ndramatically burgeoned. The different theories can be arranged roughly on a continuum, starting with\nthe most reductive to the least reductive theory: eliminative physicalism, eliminative behaviorism,\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 1 type identity theory (Chapter 2), functionalism (Chapter 3), token identity theory (also often under\nthe name property dualism; Chapter 4) and substance dualism (Chapter 1).\nThe more inner the mental phenomenon is, the more difficulty the physicalist theories will have\nmaking sense of it. For this reason, the philosophy of mind must attempt to make sense of inner\nstates that appear subjective, whether of a feeling or of a thinking nature (Chapter 5). Theories about\nthe status of such inner states and how our minds interact with the world involve discussions about\ndiverse topics such as the nature of consciousness (Chapter 6), mental concepts (Chapter 7), and\nfreedom of the will (Chapter 8).\n2 INTRODUCTION PART I.\nCHAPTERS\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 3  CHAPTER 1.\nSUBSTANCE DUALISM IN DESCARTES\nPAUL RICHARD BLUM\nINTRODUCTION\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650) was a French philosopher who is often studied as the first great\nphilosopher in the era of \u201cmodern philosophy.\u201d He is the most famous proponent of a view called\n\u201csubstance dualism,\u201d which states that the mind and the body are two different substances. While the\nbody is material (corporeal), the mind is immaterial (incorporeal). This view leaves room for human\nsouls, which are usually understood as immaterial. Descartes argued on the basis of the Christian\nviews that souls are immaterial and can exist separate from the body, but he emphasized that the\nmind alone is immaterial, whereas the other traditional functions of the souls can be explained as\ncorporeal operations. His view and arguments were so influential that after him many philosophers\nreferred to substance dualism under Descartes\u2019 name as \u201cCartesian dualism.\u201d In his explanation of the\nmind, the soul, and the ability of humans to understand the world around them through the powers\nof their minds, Descartes remains one of the most influential figures not just in modern philosophy,\nbut throughout the history of philosophy. Even in the contemporary era, philosophers such as Gilbert\nRyle (1900-1976) found worth in writing about and arguing against Descartes\u2019 views to set up their\nown theories. Ryle questioned whether the mind and body are in fact distinct and argued that they\nwould not communicate with each other if they were. Ryle states:\nBody and mind are ordinarily harnessed together\u2026.[T]he things and events which belong to the physical\nworld\u2026are external, while the workings of [a person\u2019s] own mind are internal\u2026.[This results in the] partly\nmetaphorical representation of the bifurcation of a person\u2019s two lives. (1945, 11-16)\nRyle stated that, if Descartes\u2019 theory were correct, the mind would be a mere \u201cghost in a machine,\u201d\ninactive and unable to cause actions in the body (the machine). Ryle did not term Decartes\u2019 theory\n\u201csubstance dualism\u201d but \u201cDescartes\u2019 myth.\u201d Descartes\u2019 arguments for substance dualism and the\nimmaterial nature of the mind and soul are therefore paramount to any investigation of the\nphilosophy of mind, and are still being debated in present-day theories. On the other hand, with his\ninterpretation of what he calls passions (most operations of a living body), he also provides incentives\nfor a non-dualistic physicalism of the mind.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 5 THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF SUBSTANCE\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy of mind was a response to the erosion of the traditional Aristotelian concept\nof substance after the Middle Ages. According to the Aristotelian view, any substance is composed of\nmatter that is determined by the form that is its essence. So every living thing is a body conjoined with\nits soul (namely, what makes it alive as such or such thing). In other words, an animal is an animate\nbody. The soul of a dog makes that bundle of flesh and bones a dog. The peculiar case of human beings\nis that this soul is also an intellect: the rational mind. In that case then, the soul (and certainly the\nmind) is something other than body; it is non-material (or incorporeal) because it forms and enlivens\nthe material body. So the question arises: is the soul (or at least the human mind) something that exists\non its own?\nIn the traditional Aristotelian approach, the form of a ship (what makes it look like a ship and makes\nthe ship body float on water) is nothing separate from the ship, except that we can have a concept of\nit even if there is no ship around. But what about the form of a plant or an animal? The form of plants\nand animals is their soul. When they are destroyed, their form that makes them alive (with growth,\nmovement, and senses) is gone. With human beings, that might be different: the mind may survive the\ndeath of the body. Some ancient thinkers argued that the mind or the soul survives death and enters\nanother body, be that a person or a beast: the transmigration of souls or reincarnation. The Christian\ntheory of humans teaches that the soul of an individual is created at the same time as the person;\nhowever, it lives on after the death of the person: the human intellect is immaterial and immortal.\nThis is why some Christians venerate saints, and why some occultists invoke deceased persons for\nconversation.\nThe essence of things (whether an artifact like a ship or the souls of plants, animals, and humans) was\ntermed the thing\u2019s \u201csubstantial form.\u201d Forms make and express the substance of things. The thing\u2019s\nsubstantial form makes a thing what it is, and makes it possible to conceive of it and to know it.\nThis is where Descartes starts his theory of substances. In a letter to Henricus Regius (1598-1679),\nDescartes states that he does not reject substantial forms but finds them \u201cunnecessary in setting out\n1\nmy explanations\u201d (AT III492, CSM III 205). He clearly sees them as a mere explanatory tool that\nmay be replaced by a better one. Instead, Descartes suggests any material thing is only an aggregate\nof qualities and properties. He argues, in the same letter, against the habit to apply \u201csubstantial\nform\u201d when defining the human being. He warns that to speak of substantial form both for humans\nand material things carries the risk to misunderstand the soul as something corporeal and material.\nInstead, he suggests limiting the term \u201csubstantial form\u201d to the immaterial human soul alone in\norder to emphasize that the soul\u2019s nature is \u201cquite different\u201d from the essence of things that \u201cemerge\nfrom the potentiality of matter.\u201d He says that \u201c[T]his difference in nature opens the easiest route to\ndemonstrating [the soul\u2019s] non-materiality and immortality\u201d (AT III 503, 505; CSM III 208). In order\nto elevate the soul to a level above bodily things, he downplays non-human things to mere upshots of\n1. Descartes\u2019 works are cited by the standard French edition C. Adam and P. Tannery (eds.), Oeuvres de Descartes. Paris: Vrin,\n1964-1976, \u201cAT\u201d with volume and page number; the standard English translation J. G. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff, D. Murdoch, and\nA.

This letter shows that Descartes\u2019 primary concerns are with method more than with facts and\nthat he aims at separating material fields of knowledge from the soul.\nTHE IMMATERIAL NATURE OF THE SOUL\nDescartes attempts to reconcile having an immaterial soul within a largely scientific (and physicalist)\nframework. This leads to some surprising turns within his theory that are quite different from\nprevious theories on substances. Ultimately, Descartes\u2019 view is dualist because, although he renders\nall earthly substances material (and understandable to science), one thing remains that is a true\nimmaterial substance with an essence: the human soul. Animals and human bodies, because they\nare parts of the physical world, are not strictly substances with essences; they are more properly\naggregates. He argues from what we can know (epistemology) instead of what there is (metaphysics),\nand this method directs his views on substances.\nFrom the very beginning of his research, Descartes aimed at exploring the competence of thought\nin ascertaining knowledge, and in doing so he wrote Rules for the Direction of the Mind in search\nfor assurance in science. This view would later be called \u201crationalism\u201d because he prioritized the\nfunctions of intellect, imagination, sense perception, and memory. Rationalism influenced a long\nline of philosophers from the modern era throughout the contemporary era in philosophy. He later\nrecommended a reduction of human knowledge from simple concepts and propositions. This\nmethod, as expounded in Rule XII, relies on the human mind as a \u201cpower.\u201d He states:\nAs for the objects of knowledge, it is enough if we examine the following three questions: What presents\nitself to us spontaneously? How can one thing be known on the basis of something else? What conclusions\ncan be drawn from each of these?\nNotice his emphasis on the understanding of objective knowledge. The question is not \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nbut \u201cHow does it appear to me?\u201d and \u201cHow does it connect with what I know?\u201d Investigating the nature\nof the mind is of primary importance. Knowledge of objects themselves takes a back seat to the inner\nworkings of the mind.\nDescartes describes the intellect as \u201cthe power through which we know things in the strict sense\n[that] is purely spiritual, and is \u2026 distinct from the whole body.\u201d To explain this power is difficult;\nDescartes explains that \u201cnothing quite like this power is to be found in corporeal things.\u201d It is the\nintellect that applies itself to seeing, touching, and so on; and only it can \u201cact on its own,\u201d that is, to\nunderstand. Although it may appear to be a trifle, Descartes does not make positive claims here, but\nbuffers everything with \u201cit is said\u201d (dicitur): the mind \u201cis said\u201d to see, touch, imagine, or understand.\nWhat counts is that this mental power can both receive sense data and refer to themes that have\nnothing corporeal at all (AT X 410-417, CSM I 39-43).\nIn his last work, The Passions of the Soul, Descartes focuses on those activities that are not thoughts\nin the abstract sense but \u201cpassions\u201d: \u201cthose perceptions, sensations or emotions of the soul which\nwe refer particularly to it\u201d (AT XI 349, CSM I 338f., art. 27). The body has a number of functions\n(movement, for instance); and the soul has two basic functions that are kinds of thought, namely,\nvolition and perceptions. Volitions are activities, whereas perceptions are passive motions that do\nnot originate from the soul itself (AT XI 349, CSM I 338f., art. 17). If a person desires something\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 7 or resolves to do something, that is an activity of the soul; if a person sees or hears something, that\nimpression does not come from inside but from outside\u2014the soul is affected rather than active. This\nsoul is not a member of the body; therefore, it has the surprising property not to have any location in\nthe body, but to be \u201creally joined to the whole body\u201d precisely for being non-local, not extended, and\nimmaterial. On the one hand, Descartes is reiterating the traditional Aristotelian understanding of\nensoulment (the soul as shorthand for the life of animated things); on the other hand, he is enforcing\nthe concept of body as a whole organism: since the soul is conjoined with the body as a whole,\nbody and soul together appear to be an organism. The organism is an ensemble (\u201cassemblage\u201d) of\nmaterial function (AT XI 351, CSM I 339, art. 30). A strictly physicalist and non-dualist explanation\nof sensations and passions is lurking in the background. Under a physicalist (i.e. materialist) view,\neverything (including the mind) can be explained physically; there is no need to refer to anything\noutside physics. The stakes are high for a philosophy of mind because conceiving of the body as\nan organism might lead to explaining all psychical movements as mere functioning of body parts.\nDescartes moves boldly in this direction.\nThe questions he answers in this treatise, The Passions of the Soul, before classifying and explaining\nthe six basic passions, are: How are these corporeal passions conveyed to the mind and how does the\nmind impact bodily functions due to emotions? To answer these questions, Descartes employs the\nStoic concept of animal spirits. According to the Stoic theory, a tenuous body, located in the brain,\nlinks the mind with corporeal operations. This view was en vogue in the early seventeenth century,\nfor instance in Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639) (1999). Descartes\u2019 animal spirits are \u201ca certain very\nfine air or wind\u201d that shuttle between the brain and the body parts (AT XI 332, CSM I 330, art. 7;\nSepper 2016, 26-28). They must be like little messengers that travel between body parts and mind and\nseem to understand both languages of the body and mind. They are called \u201cspirits\u201d but are expressly\ndescribed as very fine bodies coming from the blood. In order to make that plausible, an example\nDescartes gives will help.\nWonder is a sudden surprise of the soul\u2026.It has two causes: first, an impression in the brain, which\nrepresents the object as something unusual and consequently worthy of special consideration; and secondly,\na movement of the spirits, which the impression disposes both to flow with great force to the place in the\nbrain where it is located so as to strengthen and preserve it there, and also to pass into the muscles which\nserve to keep the sense organs fixed in the same orientation so that they will continue to maintain the\nimpression in the way in which they formed it. (AT XI 380f., CSM I 353, art. 70)\nBut how do those minute spirits work to communicate with the mind? Descartes points to the pineal\ngland, which was the only part in the brain that he knew of that did not come in pairs. This gland,\nhowever, is not where Descartes claims the soul resides; the soul itself has no location at all and is\ntied to the body as a whole. Rather, the fine spirits that fill the cavities of the brain use the gland to\nunite images and other sense impressions; and it is here where the mind \u201cexercises its functions more\nparticularly than in the other parts of the body\u201d (AT XI 353f., CSM I 339f., art. 30f). The animal spirits\nmediate between body and mind.\nWe are left with an apparently strictly physicalist explanation of a great deal of mental activity in a\n2\nstrongly dualist conception of mind. For the soul is a substance and it is of a totally different nature\n2. Cf. the \u201cFifth Responses\u201d in the Meditations, AT VII 230, CSM II 161.\n8 SUBSTANCEDUALISMINDESCARTES than body. Moreover, the traditionally so termed \u201clower faculties\u201d of the soul (growth, movement,\nand sensations), which are equally present in animals, are removed from the definition of the human\nsoul and ascribed to the body as an organism. Thinking (beyond the corporeal) is now the only the\nactivity of the soul. Traditionally, thinking had been the privilege of the intellectual part of the soul.\nIn Descartes, soul now means \u201crational mind.\u201d In his work on the Passions, Descartes explicitly refers\nback to his anatomy and physiology of blood circulation in his earlier Discourse on Method, where he\nalso relies on animal spirits when presenting his research project of natural science (AT VI 54, CSM\nI 138, part 5). Hence The Passions of the Soul does not in principle deviate from the program of the\nDiscourse.\nIn Part 5 of the Discourse, Descartes explicitly separates functions that are commonly attributed to\nthe mind from the soul proper. Even speech can be found in animals as long as it is nothing but an\n3\nindicator of some passions and, hence, can be imitated by machines. While these functions can be\ncompared with a clockwork, the soul cannot be reduced to matter (AT VI 58f., CSM I 140f). The\nhuman and the animal bodies are like robots that perform activities, including sense perception and\ncommunication. The mind comes in addition to that machine. Hence Gilbert Ryle\u2019s criticism that the\nmind is a mere \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d\nWhat we find in the Discourse is the encounter of Descartes the scientist with Descartes the\nphilosopher of knowledge. The early Rules had investigated the order of thinking for the sake of\nreliable interpretations of reality; the late Passions executed that in a paradigmatic way and showed to\nwhat extent methodical thinking can achieve scientific knowledge of one of the most insecure areas\nof research, human emotions. The Discourse links both efforts. It stresses method.\nON THE WAY TO SUBSTANCE DUALISM\nDescartes entertained a notion of body, and of matter in general, that escapes the traditional\nterminology of substances. Descartes\u2019 famous cogito ergo sum, often translated as \u201cI think therefore I\nam,\u201d identifies thinking as the essence of every thing that thinks. What is important for the notion of\nsubstance is that the content of what that thing is deliberately remains open. In a letter, Descartes\nclaims that nothing material can be assuredly known to exist, whereas \u201cthe soul is a being or substance\nwhich is not at all corporeal, whose nature is solely to think\u201d (AT I 353, CSM III 55). Descartes wavers\nbetween using terms such as \u201cbeing,\u201d \u201csubstance,\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d (estre, substance, nature), which indicates\nthat he is not committed to the professional philosophical terminology and concepts of his time.\nThere is an incorporeal substance that exists by way of performing the thinking, and that is all that\nthe mind can know.\nDescartes\u2019 method approaches something like substance dualism in his further development of his\ntheories. In the Meditations on First Philosophy he elaborates on the mental experiment of reducing the\nsoul to mere thought. The major purpose of this text is to prove that the soul is immaterial (if not\nimmortal). The reduction of soul to mind yields the certainty of \u201cI am, I exist,\u201d which is necessarily\ntrue, whenever it is mentally conceived (AT VII 25, CSM II 17; 2nd med.). Once again we see the mind\nguaranteeing its own existence. After contrasting this existence with that of corporeal particulars and\n3. It sounds like an anticipation of John Searle\u2019s \u201cChinese Room\u201d: exchanging signs does not entail thinking (See Chapter 3).\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 9 objects, Descartes pronounces that \u201cI am, then, in the strict sense only a thing that thinks\u201d (AT VII 27,\nCSM II 18). In the sixth meditation, Descartes distinguishes material objects from mind and stresses:\nI have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in so far as I am simply a thinking, non-extended thing (res cogitans,\nnon extensa); and on the other hand I have a distinct idea of body, in so far as this is simply an extended, non-\nthinking thing (res extensa, non cogitans). (AT VII 78, CSM II 54)\nThis talk of thinking thing vs. extended thing (res cogitans vs. res extensa) suggests a clear dualism of\nmind and body. They are mutually exclusive substances that appear to make up the world. At this\npoint, the fourth objection in the Meditations, raised by Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694), should be taken\ninto account. Arnauld surmises that Descartes is either siding with Platonists who hold that the soul\nis the only constituent of a human being and that uses the body as a tool, or he is offering a traditional\nabstraction as geometers do who abstract figures from complex reality (AT VII 203f., CSM II 143).\nPlatonists tend to deny dignity of material things and see all reality as results of spirit; geometers deal\nwith mere abstractions (as anyone knows who tries to draw a perfect circle). In both cases the dualism\nwould be dissolved. In reply, Descartes admits that this interpretation is possible but insists that the\nreal distinction of mind from body is the result of attentive meditation (AT VII 228f., CSM II 160f).\nRESHAPING THE CONCEPT OF SUBSTANCE\nAs pointed out repeatedly, Descartes is working with and around a traditional philosophical\nterminology while trying to escape it. Therefore, it is worth seeing how he defines \u201csubstance\u201d in\nhis Principles of Philosophy. One interpretation is that substance means \u201cindependent existence\u201d and\nhence applies only to God who is defined as perfect and not dependent on anything. However, in\nthe material world we learn about substances through the properties that appear to us. We don\u2019t\nsee a lake as a substance; what we see is the shiny surface of water, surrounded by a shore, which\nleads us to perceiving the lake. The \u201cprincipal attributes\u201d of body and mind are notably extension and\nthinking, respectively (AT VIII 24f., CSM I 210f., sections 51-53). Descartes was careful not to jump\nto conclusions about the actual existence of material substances separate from their attributes. Hence\nhe uses the imprecise word \u201cthing\u201d when referring to himself as essentially a thinking thing. The Latin\nterm is res. Like \u201cthing\u201d in modern English, res has no ontological claim whatsoever, that is, when\nwe say \u201cthing\u201d we avoid explaining what we mean and whether it is real. It is the \u201csomething\u201d that\n4\nlanguage can point out without saying what it is.\nWe may conclude that Descartes was aware of the temptation to present mind and body as competing\nand cooperating substances and he tried to escape the dualism, not only because any dualism is in\nneed of some mediation, as the involvement of animal spirits proves, but also and foremost because\nof its explanatory deficits. On the one hand, his view appears to embrace the dualism that comes\nwith inherited language (for instance from Platonism and Aristotelianism). On the other hand, if the\nphilosophical problem of mind is that of understanding human knowledge, then understanding must\nbe accessible to material beings and not within the realm of the immaterial. Therefore, Ryle was right\nto believe that Descartes fundamentally missed the task of understanding the mind.\n4. It is worth noting, perhaps, that the Latin version of the famous statement in the Discourse \u201cFrom this I knew I was a substance \u2026\u201d\nmodified \u201csubstance\u201d by adding \u201cany some thing or substance.\u201d Thus the author signaled that he was departing from traditional\nunderstanding of substance to a generic \u201csomething\u201d (AT VI 558: \u201crem quondam sive substantiam\u201d).\n10 SUBSTANCEDUALISMINDESCARTES To summarize the main points of the role of Descartes at the origin of modern philosophy of mind\nand specifically of substance dualism: Descartes aimed initially at proving that the human soul is\nimmaterial (as Christian doctrine teaches); for that purpose he emphasized the certainty of rational\nthinking and its independence from body and material objects. This led him to the (still debated)\nquestion of how the mind can work with the body in the process of sense perceptions, feelings, etc.\nHis response engaged the theory of \u201canimal spirits,\u201d tenuous bodies that shuttle between the mind and\nthe organs. As a consequence, he explained great deal of intellectual functions (perceptions, emotions,\netc.) in purely physical terms. At the same time he underlined the immateriality of thinking. In\ntraditional philosophical terminology, this amounted to the theory of two totally distinct substances:\nmind and body. However, it should be noted that Descartes undermined the concept of substance\nand reduced it to something deliberately vague. Therefore, philosophers who cling to the notion of\nsubstance as a reality will find substance dualism in Descartes; others, who focus on his attempts at\nexplaining mental operations like perceptions and feelings in corporeal terms, will find him to be a\nproponent of physicalism.\nREFERENCES\nAdam, Charles and Paul Tannery, eds. 1964-1976.

Materialism denies the existence of\na \u201cmind\u201d as an entity separate from the body. According to materialism, the concept of \u201cmind\u201d is a\nrelic of the past from before a time of scientific understanding and when used today is only properly\nshorthand for \u201cbrain\u201d or \u201cbehavior.\u201d Materialism therefore implies that: 1. There are no pure minds\nor souls in Heaven, Hell, or any such kind of afterlife after bodily death; 2. There are no spirits or\nimmaterial essences, and therefore spiritual and self-transformative practices that purport to move\npeople beyond their bodies, brains, and behaviors are absurd; and 3. Reincarnation and switching\nbodies (made famous in movies such as Switching Places, Freaky Friday, and Big) are nonsense. A mind\njust is a body or a body\u2019s behaviors; without a body a mind cannot exist.\nConsider the movie Big. In it, a kid named Josh makes a wish to be \u201cbig\u201d during an eerie encounter\nwith a fortune-telling machine at a state fair. When he wakes, he is a 35-year-old adult and is\nunrecognizable to his mom. He convinces his best friend that he really is Josh and his best friend helps\nhim to get a job and an apartment. Nevertheless, he cannot manage to grow emotionally enough to\ninhabit his new world. He frustrates his close female friend who cannot understand why he does not\nwant to be romantic with her. According to the standard interpretation of stories like Big, a person\u2019s\nmind contains memories, love, fears, and so on. This is what constitutes the core of who a person\nreally is. The mind is immaterial and cannot be seen; it can only be experienced by the person whose\nmind it is. But a person\u2019s mind is also connected to a body, which enables the person to communicate\nand interact with others in the world. Some bodies have minds (like other people) and some do not\n(like rocks). A body is incidental to a person\u2019s selfhood; it is just a house for the mind. So it is possible\nthat a body can age and have the same mind. And this is what happens to Josh. Eventually, Josh finds\nthe strange fortune-telling machine and wishes to be a boy again, and he re-enters his kid-body, now\nwith the knowledge and wisdom he gained in his transformative journey.\nBig is a fantasy, but it trades on common beliefs about what a person is (an immaterial mind) and\nwhat a body is (a material house for a mind which is incidental to a person\u2019s true identity). Note that\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 13 if dualism is false and the body and mind are not two, but one, as materialism claims, then a person\ncould not have the same mind in a vastly different body (or even in a slightly altered body). This is\nbecause every change in the memories, emotions, and experiences of a person would not take place in\nan immaterial mind, but rather would be translatable to talk of the body, the interactions of the body\nwith the world, or as many materialists claim, talk of the brain.\nTake what it would mean in Big for Josh to change according to such a materialist understanding.\nImagine that it is possible to induce rapid aging in a person through an entirely physical process\n(say, the taking of a pill that speeds up a person\u2019s metabolism and turnover of bodily cells), such\nthat overnight Josh ages by ten years. Even then, the turnover of those cells would have changed his\nmind just as much as it changed his body. But if his mind is identical and reducible to his brain, then\nhis mind would (of logical necessity) be changed just as much as his body. This is evident through\nLeibniz\u2019s Law (also called the \u201cindiscernibility of identicals\u201d), which is a metaphysical truth that simply\nstates that if something is identical to something else it must be identical in every way (or else it\nwould not be the same object, but merely a similar object). That means Josh\u2019s mind would no longer\nbe that of a boy; rather, he would have the mind of a man. Romantic desires would no longer be\nforeign to him (as they are in the movie) because the biological chemicals, such as testosterone, that\nare responsible for aging him into a man with a beard are the same chemicals that are responsible for\ncreating sex drives. His biochemistry would be changed and so would his energy levels and emotions.\nFurthermore, his brain mass would be larger, since a person\u2019s brain grows in the process of aging from\nchildhood to adulthood. That additional brain mass would entail not only different biochemicals,\nbut also more and differently connected neurons. Those are the same neurons and connections,\nmaterialists claim, that are responsible for the development of concepts, language, understanding, and\nso on. So if Josh woke up with his body transformed into a man, then his mind would be changed just\nas much. He could not possibly wake up with the same mind he had as a boy, according to a materialist.\nThe story of Big is not just impossible; it is nonsense. The fact that people easily make sense of the\nstory and readily suspend their disbelief shows just how deeply ingrained dualist assumptions of the\nbody and mind are. Our ignorance and ability to be misled by fantasies, however, does not show that\nmaterialism is false. Instead, the materialist will state, it shows we are gullible and that intuition is not\na reliable guide to the truth. If we were more sophisticated in our ability to grasp reality, Big would\nseem unbelievable and incomprehensible.\nThere are many different versions of materialism and behaviorism. This chapter will introduce\nsome of the most common motivations for embracing it and some of the most important historical\ndevelopments of it.\nEMPIRICISM AND SCIENCE AS REPLACEMENT FOR GOD\nThe scientific revolution began in the mid-sixteenth century and the progress of science throughout\nthe nineteenth century made science a proven method of quick advancement for knowledge. Some\nphilosophers, such as David Hume (1711-1796), argued that people should \u201creject every system \u2026\nhowever subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on fact and observation\u201d (Hume [1751] 1998). He\nand those who agree are called empiricists. Rene Descartes (1596-1650) (who argued for substance\ndualism) and John Locke (1632-1704) had philosophical theories that tried to forward philosophical\n14 MATERIALISM&BEHAVIOURISM views within science, then called mechanical philosophy, which sought to find explanations that were\nsubject to physical laws. Whereas Descartes was a rationalist, relying on principle, Locke was an\nempiricist and relied on experience (constituting evidence). Both Descartes and Locke had to prove\nthat their theories were consistent with God and the religion of the time (which in Europe was\nChristianity); however, later theorists either left God completely out of the picture or tried to show\nfrom a theoretical basis that there still was a place for God in science.\nSome of the important foundations of science, such as the closure principle and the primacy of the\nempirical over the theoretical, were prominent in philosophy, as well. In the sciences, experiments\nand theories rely centrally on the closure principle, which states that material objects have causes and\neffects that are locatable in the physical world. Without this principle, there would be no reason to\ndo scientific research. Instead of claiming that the cause of a disease is a virus, we could just as easily\nclaim that it is caused by God\u2019s wrath or a demonic force. This slowly caused people to rethink their\nideas of the existence of God. If God was no longer needed to explain the things that we experience in\nthe world\u2014if science could do it completely without the use of God\u2014then why do we need to believe\nin the existence of God?\nAn empiricist will readily point out that you cannot see God, nor can see your mind. You may be\nable to see someone else\u2019s brain if you witness a surgeon operating on someone, but you cannot\nsee anyone\u2019s mind, including your own. And according to the principle of closure, something that is\nimmaterial cannot affect something that is material, so the brain or other physical things are more\nproperly the cause of our actions, not some mystical immaterial substance of the mind.\nThe principle of Ockham\u2019s Razor\u2014named after William of Ockham (1285-1347), a philosopher from\nthe middle ages\u2014states that when something of a different kind (in this case, immaterial things) is not\nneeded to explain something else (material things), then it can be eliminated. Favored in the sciences,\nOckham\u2019s Razor is an explanatory principle of parsimony, and it gave philosophers a justification to\nremove God and other items that could not be seen (like minds) from their ontological status as real\n(separate) objects. Instead, talk of minds and mental events, such as thoughts and feelings, are simply\nshorthand expressions for processes in the body and world that science helps people to understand.\nIt is therefore reasonable, they thought, that either minds really are just bodies or else minds do not\nexist. Ockham\u2019s Razor became the battle-cry of the new materialist brand of philosophers, scientists,\nand psychologists in the modern era and even today.\nMATERIALISM\nSome philosophers who worked in the same time period as Descartes and Locke, such as Thomas\nHobbes (1588-1679), began to follow a theory generally called materialism or physicalism, which\nstates that all there is in the world and in us is material, and there is nothing immaterial. The mind had\nhistorically been conceived as immaterial with immaterial properties, such as thinking, believing, and\ndesiring. Hobbes, however, insisted that the mind\u2014and even God\u2014must be material. When I think\nof a cat and you think of a cat, we think of the same concept (we assume), but how can we know that,\nand communicate with confidence, when there is nothing physical in the thought? How is it the case\nthat we can ever verify that we are thinking of the same thing? Under materialism, if there is no such\nthing as an immaterial mind then what was previously called \u201cthinking\u201d must instead be explained\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 15 by the body, the interactions of the body in the world, or more simply in modern materialism, the\nneurological firings of the brain. What we think of as thinking is an action of the body, and what we\nthink of when we think of concepts such as \u201ccat\u201d is anchored in the material world of sense perception.\nType identity is a materialist theory that asserts that all mental states are identical to certain types\nof physical states. Contemporary proponents J. J. C. Smart (1920-2012) and U. T. Place (1924-2000)\nexplained that science will reveal to us through experiments which kinds of mental states are\nequivalent to which kinds of physical processes in the brain. Note that a correlation between two\nkinds of states does not show that they are identical: a mental one of love and a physical one of more\navailable serotonin in the brain, for example. Also, a physical event under type identity cannot be said\nto cause a mental one. Being hugged by someone does not cause a feeling happiness; rather it is an\nexample of a physical action that causes certain nerves in the skin to send signals to the brain and\ncreate a sequence of firing that is identical to a feeling of happiness. Both correlation and causation\nassume that there are two events of different kinds that are related. Under materialism, there is just\none kind of thing, so while it may appear that a mental and a physical event are related, the mental\nevent is identical to the physical event. It is important to refrain from these errors when speaking\nabout materialism.\nBrain scans reveal the physical processes that happen in the brain when people commonly experience\nseemingly mental events, giving credence to the type identity theorist\u2019s assertion that mental and\nbrain events are just the same thing. A well-known example is that of the experience of pain, a kind of\nmental event that appears to be an immaterial feeling. The type identity theorist states that pain just\nis the completely physical event of C-fibers firing in the brain. When C-fibers fire, a person is in pain.\nSometimes a person may not be fully aware of the pain they have, say, for example, if their attention is\nelsewhere or if another neurological process is covering up a subjective experience of pain. Imagine a\nperson who gets struck in the head by a large rock. He is in fact injured and C-fibers fire in the brain,\nbut then the person becomes unconscious. That is not to say he is not in pain; he is just unaware of\nit. Or say that a person gets attacked by a shark in the ocean and succeeds in fending it off. She is\nbleeding and is injured, but the ocean is so cold that her extremities are numb. In this case, there is a\ndifferent physical process that is either postponing or covering up C-fibers firing, and therefore her\nexperience of pain will be delayed until she is out of the cold ocean.\nThere have been numerous attacks against type identity theory that are so successful that many\nidentity theorists have changed their account. One of the most devastating objections is based on the\nobservation that different kinds of brains can realize pain. Animals surely experience pain like we do,\nbut most animals have dramatically different brains, connections, and biochemicals than we do, so\nmental events like pain cannot be categorically reduced to a particular human brain kind of event.\nHilary Putnam (1926-2016) astutely argued that this observation, called the multiple realizability\nof the mental, should lead us to abandon any supposed identity of kinds between the mental and\nthe physical (Putnam 1967). Any account of mental events must explain how similar mental events\nappear to take place across a wide range of physical beings. We might even imagine beings from a\ndistant planet who are silicone-based instead of carbon-based that also experience pain even though\ntheir systems have no physical similarities whatsoever to human brains and neurological events. This\nargument has led many to embrace a different account of the identity or reduction of the mental to the\n16 MATERIALISM&BEHAVIOURISM physical. In order to avoid this criticism, for example, token identity theories purport that all mental\nevents reduce to a physical brain state, yet claim the identity is not necessarily instantiated by the same\nor similar brain states between people, or even within a single person at various times. Expositions of\nthis theory vary and can often cross into other theories of mind, such as functionalism (see Chapter 3)\nand property dualism (see Chapter 4), so they will not be discussed here.\nDespite most theorists\u2019 discouragement of the arguments against type identity theory, there is a more\nradical materialist theory that embraces even more counterintuitive conclusions. Instead of taking\non the explanatory burden of connecting the identity of mental and brain events, these theorists\nclaim that everything is purely physical. There are no thoughts, no emotions, no minds. Everything\nis just an effect of brain and other physical processes. This kind of materialism is called eliminative\nmaterialism or reductive materialism because it states not only that the mind and the world should be\nexplained consistently and within science as Descartes and Locke agreed, or that the mind should be\nseen as part of the physical realm as the type identity theorists do, but that there simply is no mind.\nContemporary proponents of eliminative materialism Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland\nexplain our perceptions of the world according to neurology. An eliminative materialist would say\nthat the feeling of pain is an illusion. We have become habituated to call certain things pain when\nat bottom there are only physical events happening. In discussions with the Dalai Lama, Patricia\nChurchland claims that she cannot say she even has the emotion of love toward her own child\n(because love is an illusion) and the beliefs of ordinary people who say there are such things as love\nand other emotions are false (Houshmand, Livingston, and Wallace 1999). Folk psychology, the theory\nof mind that embraces intuitions by the \u201ccommon folk\u201d who are uneducated about science, is merely\na convenient myth.\nEliminative materialism is the most extreme view opposing substance dualism. The eliminative\nmaterialist truly eliminates the existence of minds, and with them, all of the features of mentality.\nThey reject experiences, thoughts, and even actions. Therefore, although eliminative materialism\nexplains everything within a scientific framework, it does so at the great cost of our intuitions,\nthoughts, feelings, and selves. Indeed, it eliminates most of what a theory of mind intends to\nunderstand. Many philosophers claim that Ockham\u2019s Razor has gone too far if most of what we\nintended to explain gets dismissed entirely. An account of the mind that brings back more of the\nfeatures of normal life and explains those within a scientific framework is preferable to preserve the\nlife and meaning of what people think, do, and say.\nBEHAVIORISM AND THE LOGICAL POSITIVISTS\nIn the empiricist tradition, a different movement attempted to situate the mind within the realm\nof the material world, not through the identity of the two but through the explanation of the mind\ncompletely in terms of physical behaviors and events. Logical behaviorism claims that mental events\n(like pain) are to be understood as a set of behaviors (saying \u201couch,\u201d screaming, or cringing after\nbeing hit). In this way, pain is entirely explainable within a concrete scientific framework that can be\nobserved and communicated clearly between all beings.\nThe logical positivists (spanning from the Vienna Circle in 1922 through the 1950s in the United\nStates) thought that if they could mimic the methods of the sciences that philosophical advances\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 17 would also be imminent. Those such as Otto Neurath (1882-1945) and Rudolph Carnap (1891-1970)\nperformed rigorous analyses to show that the mind and other non-observable and non-scientifically\nverifiable objects did not exist, and that those things we thought were immaterial could be\nconstructed from completely material objects and processes. Some argued that all talk of immaterial\nobjects or processes should be eliminated from our language. Their impact was tremendous and\nthe terrain of Western philosophy shifted toward philosophy of language throughout the twentieth\ncentury. The period of logical positivism is also known as \u201cthe linguistic turn\u201d (of the century). Some\nof the most important philosophers of the twentieth century, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) and\nW. V. O. Quine (1908-2000), were closely aligned with the Vienna Circle and logical positivism.\nThe logical positivists appeared to have a solution for the dilemma concerning the meaning of what\npeople say and the integration of the mental within the physical. Instead of rendering everything\ninvolving the mental illusory or false, mental talk can be translated and should be translated into talk\nof behavior. The mind therefore becomes encapsulated within the realm of action. The argument goes\nlike this: we do not need to eliminate all talk of our minds or our thoughts, and we do not need to\nsay that all things involving such subjects are false. It is just that the meanings of all of those words\nand thoughts are not what they seem at first. What these words really are is a kind of shorthand for\nthings that are all empirically observable, and most importantly, our behaviors. After all, we cannot\nsee our thoughts and it seems like what we have always really meant by our talk of the mental we\nhave created from observations of behavior. When I say, \u201cMom is angry,\u201d what I mean is that she is\nacting in such and such a way, not smiling, furrowing her eyebrows, not talking much, and so on. In\nthis way, many of the things that we say come out true, and they all rely on empirical evidence\u2014the\nevidence that we have always been gathering from the behavior of people. According to the logical\nbehaviorist, if mental talk cannot be translated into behavior talk, then that particular mental talk is\nmeaningless, just like Lewis Carroll\u2019s nonsense poem \u201cJabberwocky.\u201d The poem sounds grammatical\nand it resembles real words: \u201cTwas bryllyg, and the slythy toves,\u201d it begins (Carroll and Tenniel 1872).\nPeople often have interpretations and emotional reactions to it, but it does not mean anything. Logical\nbehaviorists believed poetry, art, and much of literature fell into this camp. It was entertaining but\nmeaningless.\nThe logical behaviorists soon became overrun by possibly the most decisive objections in the history\nof philosophy. Whereas most philosophical positions refine themselves and carry more or fewer\nadherents, logical positivism and logical behaviorism had such devastating objections of inconsistency\nleveled against them that adhering to them became nearly impossible. There are two theoretical\nobjections that were particularly damaging for logical behaviorism. The first depends on the principle\nof verificationism. Many of the logical positivists, including Carl Hempel (1905-1997), held a theory\nwhereby all truths relied on their verification, either analytically (in virtue of their meanings, or by\ndefinition) or synthetically (not in virtue of their meanings, which, for Hempel indicated that they\nwere true by experience) (Hempel 1980). Rudolph Carnap, though a member of the Vienna Circle,\nrealized that verification was too stringent a demand to be met by any proposition, and he spent\na good portion of his philosophical career trying out different criteria to rescue the theory from\nthe criticism. As argued by Hilary Putnam, the principle of verification itself could not be verified\nand it was therefore \u201cself-refuting\u201d (Putnam 1983). Second, behaviorists were unable to provide the\nnecessary and sufficient behavioral conditions required for translating talk about minds into talk\n18 MATERIALISM&BEHAVIOURISM about behaviors. In fact, Peter Geach (1916-2013) gave an objection to logical behaviorism that\neliminated any kind of definition of beliefs or other mental states purely in terms of behaviors.\nEverything that a person does, or is disposed to do, depends on the person\u2019s beliefs and desires, so\ndefining one belief in terms of certain actions just prolongs the problem of defining it, since the\nactions used to define it will make reference to yet other beliefs and desires. The account is therefore\ncircular (Geach 1957, 8).\nAnother objection argues that behavior is both unnecessary and insufficient to account for what\npeople mean by their use of mental concepts. The success of this objection affects the strong version\nof logical behaviorism (and usually the view to which people refer) which states that there are\nnecessary and sufficient conditions within behavior to define mentality. To refute this view, focusing\non the sufficiency of the behavior, a critic must find cases where there is behavior that mimics the\nexistence of minds but where there is no mind. Ned Block, for example, said that puppets controlled\nvia radio links by other minds outside the puppet\u2019s hollow body would mimic a mind working\nbut is not a mind working (Block 1981). To refute the other side, that behavior is necessary for\nmentality, which could be seen as a weaker form of behaviorism if accepted without the sufficiency\ncondition, the critic needs to find examples where there is thinking going on, but without the\nbehavior. This is more difficult. Disembodied minds or thinking objects, if they exist, could constitute\ncounterexamples. Hilary Putnam argued that we can imagine a world in which people experience pain\nbut are conditioned to disguise their pain behaviors (Putnam 1963). Our ability to coherently think\nof such a world shows that pain is not conceptually and necessarily tied to behaviors, even if in our\nworld we most often experience them contingently connected (see Chapter 5). Ludwig Wittgenstein,\nregarded as a champion for the logical positivists and the behaviorists, himself eventually turned away\nfrom a behaviorist-like theory to a theory that relied on thoughts as separate and independent from\nour descriptions of them.\nCONCLUSION\nToday, materialist and behaviorist views enjoy prominence in the sciences, but not in philosophy.\nBiologists and neuroscientists are working hard to uncover the mysteries of behavior and the brain.\nEach time they learn more information, they help build a better basis for a purely empirical\nphilosophy of mind. But empirical research alone will never be sufficient to ground a materialist or\nbehaviorist theory of mind. Both the radical theory of eliminativism (which intends to show that\nthe mind does not exist) and non-reductive identity theories (which propose that mental events are\nalways the same as physical events) still require persuasive philosophical arguments to show that\nminds are redundant or unnecessary in our ontology. Scientists themselves rely on self-reports of\nfeelings and thoughts even while they conduct studies attempting to show that the mind can be\nreduced to the brain. An evolution in our ways of studying the body and the brain that do not rely on\nself-reports of feelings and thoughts seems a long way off.\nThe problem is that evidence of the workings of the body and brain, no matter how advanced, can\nnever in itself establish a definite reduction of the mind to the body and the brain. Science alone\ncannot demonstrate the equivalence of the mind to the body or brain. Thus far, Ockham\u2019s Razor has\nnot yet successfully shaved off the necessity of talk about minds for most philosophers. One day, an\nevolution in human ways of relating to ourselves and each other may rely less on feelings and thoughts\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 19 and more on reactions and behaviors. Perhaps, it may be observed, the human condition was once\nlike that, more instinctual in origin. Even if this is true, observations of the origin of human life do\nnot indicate that our current human condition is entirely material. Some may argue that an evolution\ntowards reliance on an immaterial mind marks progress in our species. Others may argue that the\nevolution of a seemingly immaterial mind shows the sophistication of brain. The debate will likely\ncontinue until talk of immaterial minds appears to be unnecessary.\nREFERENCES\nBlock, Ned. 1981. \u201cTroubles with Functionalism.\u201d In Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science IX,\ned.

If Odysseus\nis to pass through the strait, he must choose between two very unhappy options; for if he averts one\nalong the way, he will move in the other\u2019s monstrous reach. On the one side is roaring Charybdis,\nwho would surely blot out\u2014as if by colossal whirlpool\u2014Odysseus\u2019s entire ship. (Have you ever been\nfaced with an option so bad that you cannot believe you have to seriously consider it? Well, this is\nOdysseus\u2019s bleak situation.) On the other side of the strait, things fare little better for Odysseus and his\nwar-weary crew: we have vicious Scylla, who only by comparison to Charybdis, looks like the right\nchoice. The ship makes it through, Homer tells us, minus those who were snatched from the ship\u2019s\ndeck and eaten alive. Six are taken, we are told, one for each of Scylla\u2019s heads. By comparison only,\nindeed.\nIn this chapter we consider the theory of mind known as functionalism, the view that minds are really\nfunctional systems like the computing systems we rely on every day, only much more complex. The\nfunctionalist claims to sail a middle path between materialism (discussed in Chapter 2), or the joint\nthesis that minds are brains and mental states are brain states, and behaviorism (also discussed in\nChapter 2), or the thesis that mental states are behavioural states or dispositions to behave in certain\nways.\nAVOIDING MATERIALISM\nOne the one side we have materialism, which we must avoid because there appears to be no strict\nidentity between mental states and brain states. Even though human Freya is different than a wild\nrabbit in many interesting ways, we think they can both be in physical pain. Suppose that while\nrestringing her guitar, Freya lodges a rogue metal splinter off the D string in the top of her ring\nfinger. She winces in pain. Physiologically and neurologically, a lot happened\u2014from the tissue damage\n22 PHILOSOPHYOFMIND caused by the metal splinter, to Freya\u2019s finally wincing from the sensation. But it only took\nmilliseconds.\nNow suppose that while out foraging and hopping about, the wild rabbit mishops on the prickly side\nof a pinecone. The rabbit cries out a bit, winks hard, and hops off fast. A very similar physiological\nand neurological chain of events no doubt transpired from the mishop on the pinecone to hopping off\nfast in pain. But as interestingly similar as the wild rabbit\u2019s brain is to human Freya\u2019s, it is not plausible\nto think that both Freya and the wild rabbit entered into the same brain state. We do want to say\nthey entered into the same mental state, however. That is, they were both in pain. Since the same pain\nstate can be realized in multiple kinds of brains, we can say that mental states like pain are multiply\nrealizable. This is bad news for the materialist; it looks like brain states and mental states come apart.\nAVOIDING BEHAVIORISM\nNow we look bleary-eyed in the direction of behaviorism. But here, too, we find a suspicious identity\nclaim\u2014this time between mental states, like Freya\u2019s belief that her house is gray, and behavioral states\nor dispositions to behave in certain circumstances. For example, if Freya were asked what color her\nhouse is, she would be disposed to answer, \u201cGray.\u201d But just as with mental states and brain states,\nFreya\u2019s believing that her Colonial-period house is painted the original gray from when the house was\nfirst built and painted in 1810, and her dispositions to behave accordingly, come apart, showing that\nthey could not be identical.\nSuppose Freya wants to throw a housewarming party for herself and includes a colorful direction in\nthe invitation that hers is the \u201conly big gray Colonial on Jones St. Can\u2019t miss it.\u201d We say that Freya\nwould not sincerely include such a thing if she did not believe it to be true. And we have no reason to\nsuspect she is lying. We can go further. We want to say that it is her belief that her Colonial is big, is\ngray, and the only one like it on Jones Street that causes her, at least in part, to include that direction\nin the invitation. But if it is her mental state (her belief) that caused her behavior, then the mental\nstate and the behavioral state (her including the colorful direction in the invitation) cannot be strictly\nidentical.\nFreya might very well have been disposed to give just such a colorful direction to her home, given\nher beliefs, as the behaviorist would predict; and this disposition might even come with believing the\nthings Freya does. But if we want to refer to Freya\u2019s beliefs in our explanation of her behavior\u2014and\nthis is the sort of thing we do when we say our beliefs and other mental states cause our\nbehavior\u2014then we must hold that they are distinct, since otherwise our causal explanation would be\nviciously circular.\nIt would be circular because the thing to be explained, her Colonial-describing behavior, is the same\nthing as the thing that is supposed to causally explain it, her Colonial-descriptive beliefs; and the\ncircle would be vicious because nothing would ever really get explained. So the behaviorist, like the\nmaterialist, seems to see an identity where there is none.\nNO TURNING BACK: THE MIND IS NATURAL\nThe goal is to formulate an alternative to the above two theories of mind that nevertheless both make\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 23 a promise worth making: to treat the mind as something wholly a part of the natural world. From\nthe failures of materialism and behaviorism, we must not turn back to a problematic Cartesian dualist\nview of mind and matter (discussed in Chapter 1), where it again would become utterly mysterious\nhow Freya\u2019s beliefs about how her Colonial looks could possibly influence her physical behavior, since\nher beliefs and physical behavior exist on different planes of existence, as it were. But there is a third\nway to view beliefs like Freya\u2019s.\nFUNCTIONALISM AS THE MIDDLE PATH\nOur way between the two monsters is to take seriously the perhaps dangerous idea that minds really\nare computing machines. In England, Alan Turing (1912-1954) laid the groundwork for such an idea\nwith his monumental work on the nature of computing machines and intelligence (1936, 230-265;\n1950, 433-460). Turing was able to conceive of a computing machine so powerful that it could\nsuccessfully perform any computable function a human being could be said to carry out, whether\nconsciously, as in the math classroom, or at the subconscious level, as in the many computations\ninvolved in navigating from one side to the other of one\u2019s room.\nA Turing machine, as it came to be called, is an abstract computer model designed with the purpose\nof illustrating the limits of computability. Thinking creatures like human beings, of course, are not\nabstract things. Turing machines are not themselves thinking machines, but insofar as thinking states\ncan be coherently understood as computational states, a Turing machine or Turing machine-inspired\nmodel should provide an illuminating account of the mind.\nTuring\u2019s ideas were developed in the United States by philosopher Hilary Putnam (1926-2016).\nFunctionalism treats minds as natural phenomena contra Cartesian dualism; mental states, like pain,\nas multiply realizable, contra materialism; and mental states as causes of behavior, contra\nbehaviorism. In its simple form, it is the joint thesis that the mind is a functional system, kind of like\nan operating system of a computer, and mental states like beliefs, desires, and perceptual experiences\nare really just functional states, kind of like inputs and outputs in that operating system. Indeed,\noften this simple version of functionalism is known as \u201cmachine\u201d or \u201cinput-output functionalism\u201d to\nhighlight just those mechanical features of the theory.\nNOTHING\u2019S SHOCKING: THE FUNCTIONALIST MIND IS A NATURAL MIND\nThe functionalist says if we conceive of mental stuff in this way\u2014namely, as fundamentally inputs\nand outputs in a complex, but wholly natural system\u2014then we get to observe the reality of the mind,\nand the reality of our mental lives. We get to avoid any genuine worries about mental stuff being too\nspooky, or about how it could possibly interact with material stuff, as one might genuinely worry\non a Cartesian dualist theory of mind, where we are asked to construe mental stuff and material\nstuff as fundamentally two kinds of substances. With functionalism, the how-possible question about\ninteraction between the mental and material simply does not arise, no more than it would for the\nsoftware and hardware interaction in computers, respectively. So, on the functionalist picture of the\nmind, the mysterious fog is lifted, and the way is clear.\n24 FUNCTIONALISM MULTIPLE REALIZABILITY\nLet us use a thought experiment of our own to illustrate the functionalist\u2019s theory of mind. Imagine\nFreya cooks a warm Sunday breakfast for herself and sits on a patio table in the spring sun to enjoy\nit. Freya\u2019s belief that \u201cmy tofu scramble is on the table before me\u201d is to be understood roughly like\nthis: as the OUTPUT of one mental state, her seeing her breakfast on the table before her, and as the\nINPUT for others, including other beliefs Freya might have or come to have by deductive inference\n(\u201csomething is on the table before me,\u201d and so on and so forth) and behaviors (e.g., sticking a fork into\nthat tofu scramble and scarfing it down). Note well: we have not mentioned anything here about the\nwork Freya\u2019s sensory cortex or thalamus or the role the rods and cones in her retina are playing in\ngetting her to believe what she does; her belief is identified only by its functional or causal role. This\nseems to imply that Freya\u2019s breakfast belief is multiply realizable, like pain is.\nRecall our earlier discussion of the important difference between rabbit-brain stuff and human-brain\nstuff. Nevertheless, we wanted to say that both Freya and the wild rabbit could be in pain. We said\npain, then, is multiply realizable. This is another way of saying that being in pain does not require\nany specific realization means, just some or other adequate means of realization. The point also\nstrongly implies that the means of realization for Freya\u2019s breakfast belief, no less than her pain, need\nnot be a brain state at all. This signals a major worry for the materialist. Since our beliefs, desires,\nand perceptual experiences are identified by their functional or causal role, the functionalist has no\nproblem accounting for the multiple realizability of mental states.\nREAL CAUSE: THE FUNCTIONALIST MIND CAUSES BEHAVIOR\nFinally, we saw that our mental states cannot be counted as the causes of our behavior on a behaviorist\nview, since on that view of mind, mental states are nothing over and above our behavior (or,\ndispositions to behave in certain ways in certain circumstances). In an effort to disenchant the mind in\ngeneral and individual minds in particular, and move mental states like beliefs and pain into scientific\nview, the behaviorist recoiled too far from spooky Cartesian dualism, leaving nothing in us to be\nthe causes of our own behavior. The functionalist understands, like the behaviorist, that there is a\nclose connection between our beliefs, desires, and pains, on the one hand, and our behavior, on the\nother. It is just that the connection is a functional, or causal, one, not one of identity. Since mental\nstates (like Freya\u2019s belief that \u201cmy tofu scramble is on the table before me\u201d) are identified with their\nfunctional or causal role in the larger functional system of inputs and outputs, other mental states and\nbehavioral states, the functionalist has no problem accounting for mental states playing a causal role\nin the explanations we give of our own behavior. On the functionalist theory of mind, mental states\nare real causes of behavior.\nOBJECTIONS TO FUNCTIONALISM\nNow that we have seen some of the major points in favor of the theory, let us have a look at some of\nthe worries that have been raised against functionalism.\nThe Chinese Room\nJohn Searle argues against a version of functionalism he calls \u201cstrong\u201d artificial intelligence, or \u201cstrong\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 25 AI\u201d In \u201cMinds, Brains and Programs,\u201d Searle develops a thought experiment designed to show that\nhaving the right inputs and outputs is not sufficient for having mental states, as the functionalist\nclaims (1980). The specific issue concerns what is required to understand Chinese.\nImagine someone who does not understand Chinese is put in a room and tasked with sorting Chinese\nsymbols in response to other Chinese symbols, according to purely formal rules given in an English-\nlanguage manual. So, for example, one person can write some Chinese symbols on a card, place it in a\nbasket on a conveyor belt which leads into and out from the little room you are in. Once you receive\nit, you look at the shape of the symbol, find it in the manual, and read which Chinese symbols to\nfind in the other basket to send back out. Imagine further that you get very good at this manipulation\nof symbols, so good in fact that you can fool fluent Chinese speakers with the responses you give.\nTo them, you function every bit like you understand Chinese. It appears, however, you have no true\nunderstanding at all. Therefore, Searle concludes, functioning in the right way is not sufficient for\nhaving mental states.\nThe functionalist has replied that, of course, as the thought experiment is described, the person in\nthe room does not understand Chinese. But also as the case is described, the person in the room\nis just a piece of the whole functional system. Indeed, it is the system that functions to understand\nChinese, not just one part. So it is the whole system, in this case, the whole room, including the person\nmanipulating the symbols and the instruction manual (the \u201cprogram\u201d), that understands Chinese.\nThe Problem of Qualia\nThe splinter Freya picked up from her D string caused her a bit of pain, and perhaps more so for the\nbehaviorist, as we saw earlier. One major worry for the functionalist is that there seems to be more\nto Freya\u2019s pain than its just being the putative cause of some pain-related behavior, where this cause\nis understood to be another mental state, presumably, not identified with pain at all. (Remember,\nthe functionalist wishes to avoid the vicious circularity that plagued the behaviorist\u2019s explanations of\nbehavior.)\nThere is an undeniable sensation to pain: it is something you feel. In fact, some might argue that at\nthe conscious level, that is all there is to pain. Sure, there is the detection of tissue damage and the\nhost physiological and neurological events transpiring, and yes, there is the pain-related behavior,\ntoo. However, we must not leave out of our explanation of pain the feel of pain. Philosophers call\nthe feeling aspect of some mental states like pain fundamentally qualitative states. Other qualitative\nmental states might include experiences of colored objects, such as those a person with normal color\nvision has every day.\nIn seeing a Granny Smith apple in the basket on a dining room table, she has a visual experience as of a\ngreen object. But the functionalist can only talk about the experience in terms of the function or causal\nrole it plays. So, for example, the functionalist can speak to Freya\u2019s green experience as being the cause\nof her belief that she sees a green apple in the basket. But the functionalist cannot speak to the feeling\nFreya (or any of us) has in seeing a ripe green Granny Smith. We think there is a corresponding feeling\nto color experiences like Freya\u2019s over and above whatever beliefs they might go on to cause us to have.\nSince mental states like pain and color experiences are identified solely by their functional role, the\nfunctionalist seems without the resources to account for these qualitative mental states.\n26 FUNCTIONALISM The functionalist might reply by offering a treatment of qualia in terms of what such aspects of\nexperience function to do for us. The vivid, ripe greenness of the Granny Smith functions to inform\nFreya about a source of food in a way that pulls her visual attention to it. Freya\u2019s color experiences\nallow her to form accurate beliefs about the objects in her immediate environment. It is certainly\ntrue that ordinary visual experience provide us with beautiful moments in our lives. However, they\nlikely function to do much more besides. Likewise, it is more likely that there is a function for the\nqualitative or feeling aspects of some mental states, and that these aspects can be understood in terms\nof their functions, than it is that these aspects are free-floating above the causal order of things. So,\nthe functionalist who wishes to try to account for qualia need not remain silent on the issue.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have not considered all the possible objections to functionalism, nor have we considered more\nsophisticated versions of functionalism that aim to get around the more pernicious objections we have\nconsidered. The idea that minds really are kinds of computing machines is still very much alive and\nas controversial as ever. Taking that idea seriously means having to wrestle with a host of questions at\nthe intersection of philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and personal identity.\nIn what sense is Freya truly an agent of her own actions, if we merely cite a cold input to explain\nsome behavior of hers? That is to say, how does Freya avow her own beliefs on a merely functionalist\nview? If minds are kinds of computers, then what does that make thinking creatures like Freya? Kinds\nof robots, albeit sophisticated ones? These and other difficult questions will need to be answered\nsatisfactorily before many philosophers will be content with a functionalist theory of mind. For other\nphilosophers, a start down the right path, away from Cartesian dualism and between the two terrors\nof materialism and behaviorism, has already been made.\nREFERENCES\nPutnam, Hilary.

However, there is another form of dualism, quite popular nowadays, which is\ncalled property dualism, a position which is sometimes associated with non-reductive physicalism.\nCartesian dualism posits two substances, or fundamental kinds of thing: material substance and\nimmaterial thinking substance. These are two entirely different kinds of entities, although they\ninteract with each other. According to property dualism, on the other hand, there is one fundamental\nkind of thing in the world\u2014material substance\u2014but it has two essentially different kinds of property:\nphysical properties and mental properties. So for instance, a property dualist might claim that a\nmaterial thing like a brain can have both physical properties (like weight and mass) and mental\nproperties (such as having a particular belief or feeling a shooting pain), and that these two kinds\nof properties are entirely different in kind. Some philosophers subscribe to property dualism for all\nmental properties while others defend it only for conscious or \u201cphenomenal\u201d properties such as the\n1\nfeeling of pain or the taste of wine. These latter properties give rise to what is known as the hard\nproblem of consciousness: How do we explain the existence of consciousness in a material world?\nThough these are both dualist views, they differ in fundamental ways. Property dualism was proposed\nas a position that has a number of advantages over substance dualism. One advantage is that, because\nit does not posit an immaterial mental substance, it is believed to be more scientific than Cartesian\ndualism and less religiously motivated. A second advantage is that it seems to avoid the problem of\nmental causation because it posits only one kind of substance; there is no communication between\ntwo different kinds of thing. And a third advantage is that, by maintaining the existence of distinctly\nmental properties, it does justice to our intuitions about the reality of the mind and its difference from\nthe physical world. But to understand all this we need to take a step back.\n1. Examples of non-conscious mental properties include beliefs that most of the time are not conscious, or our attitudes, drives, and\nmotivations\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 29 SUBSTANCES AND PROPERTIES\nThe notion of a substance has a long history going back to Ancient Greek metaphysics, most\nprominently to Aristotle, and it has been understood in various ways since then. For present purposes\nwe can say that a substance can be understood as a unified fundamental kind of entity\u2014e.g. a person,\nor an animal\u2014that can be the bearer of properties. In fact, the etymology of the Latin word substantia\nis that which lies below, that which exists underneath something else. So, for instance, a zebra can be\na substance, which has properties, like a certain color, or a certain number of stripes. But the zebra\nis independent of its properties; it will continue to exist even if the properties were to change (and,\naccording to some views, even if they ceased to exist altogether).\nAccording to Cartesian dualism there are two kinds of substance: the material substance, which is\nextended in space and is divisible, and mental substances whose characteristic is thought. So each\nperson is made up of these two substances\u2014matter and mind\u2014that are entirely different in kind\nand can exist independently of each other. Talking of the mind in terms of substances gives rise to a\nnumber of problems (see Chapter 1). To avoid these problems, property dualism argues that mentality\nshould be understood in terms of properties, rather than substances: instead of saying that there\nare certain kinds of things that are minds, we say that to have a mind is to have certain properties.\nProperties are characteristics of things; properties are attributed to, and possessed by, substances. So\naccording to property dualism there are different kinds of properties that pertain to the only kind of\nsubstance, the material substance: there are physical properties like having a certain color or shape,\nand there are mental properties like having certain beliefs, desires and perceptions.\nProperty dualism is contrasted with substance dualism since it posits only one kind of substance,\nbut it is also contrasted with ontological monist views, such as materialism or idealism, according\nto which everything that exists (including properties) is of one kind. Usually, property dualism is\nput forward as an alternative to reductive physicalism (the type identity theory) \u2013 the view that all\nproperties in the world can, in principle at least, be reduced to, or identified with, physical properties\n(Chapter 2).\nHilary Putnam\u2019s (1926-2016) multiple realization argument is a main reason why reductive\nphysicalism is rejected by some philosophers, and it provides an argument for property dualism.\nAlthough this argument was originally used as an argument for functionalism, since it challenges\nthe identity of mental states with physical states, it was taken up by non-reductive physicalists and\nproperty dualists alike. According to the multiple realization argument then, it is implausible to\nidentify a certain kind of mental state, like pain, with a certain type of physical state since mental\nstates might be implemented (\u201crealized\u201d) in creatures (or even non-biological systems) that have a very\ndifferent physical make up than our own. For instance, an octopus or an alien may very well feel pain\nbut pain might be realized differently in their brains than it is in ours. So it seems that mental states\ncan be \u201cmultiply realizable.\u201d This is incompatible with the idea that pain is strictly identical with one\nphysical property, as the identity theory seems to claim. If this is correct, and there is no possibility\nof reduction of types of mental states to types of physical states, then mental properties and physical\nproperties are distinct, which means that there are two different kinds of properties in the world and,\ntherefore, property dualism is true.\n30 PROPERTYDUALISM In addition to the multiple realization argument, probably the most famous argument for property\ndualism is the knowledge argument put forward by Frank Jackson (1982). This argument involves the\nimaginary example of Mary, a brilliant neuroscientist who was raised in a black and white room. She\nknows everything there is to know about the physical facts about vision but she has never seen red (or\nany color for that matter). One day Mary leaves the black and white room sees a red tomato. Jackson\nclaims that Mary learns something new upon seeing the red tomato\u2014she learns what red looks like.\nTherefore, there must be more to learn about the world than just physical facts, and there are more\nproperties in the world than just physical properties.\nKINDS OF PROPERTY DUALISM\nProperty dualism can be divided into two kinds. The first kind of property dualism says that there\nare two kinds of properties, mental and physical, but mental properties are dependent on physical\nproperties. This dependence is usually described in terms of the relation of supervenience. The basic\nidea of supervenience is that a property, A, supervenes on another property, B, if there cannot be a\ndifference in A without a difference in B (though there can be differences in B with no change in\nA, which allows for the multiple realizability of mental properties). So, for example, if the aesthetic\nproperties of a work of art supervene on its physical properties, there cannot be a change in its\naesthetic properties unless there is a change in its physical properties. Or, if I feel fine now but have\na headache five minutes from now, there must be a physical difference in my brain in these two\nmoments. Another way of putting the idea that mental properties depend on physical properties is to\nsay that if you duplicate all the physical properties of the world, you will automatically duplicate the\nmental properties as well\u2014they would come \u201cfor free.\u201d\nThis kind of view is sometimes called non-reductive physicalism, and is often considered to be a\nform of property dualism, since it holds that there are two kinds of properties. Jaegwon Kim is\na prominent supporter of the irreducibility of phenomenal properties (though he resists the term\n\u201cproperty dualism\u201d and prefers to call his position \u201csomething near enough\u201d physicalism [2005]). Kim\nholds that intentional properties, like having a belief or hoping for something to happen, can be\n2\nfunctionally reduced to physical properties. However, this is not so for phenomenal properties (like\ntasting a particular taste or experiencing a certain kind of afterimage), which supervene on physical\nproperties but cannot be reduced, functionally or otherwise, to physical properties.\nAccording to Kim, there is a difference between intentional and phenomenal properties: Phenomenal\n(qualitative) mental states cannot be defined functionally, as intentional states can (or can in principle),\nand therefore cannot be reduced either. Briefly, the reason is that although phenomenal states can\nbe associated with causal tasks these descriptions do not define or constitute pain. That is, though,\npain can be associated with the state that is caused by tissue damage, that induces the belief that\nsomething is wrong with one\u2019s body and that results in pain-avoidance behavior, this is not what pain\nis. Pain is what it feels like to be in pain, it is a subjective feeling. In contrast, intentional states like\n2. In functional reduction we identify the functional/causal role that the phenomenon we are interested plays and then reduce that\nrole to a physical (token) state that realizes it. To use an example given by Kim in Physicalism, Or Something Near Enough, a gene is\ndefined functionally as the mechanism that encodes and transmits genetic information. That is what a gene does. What \u201crealizes\u201d the\nrole of the gene, however, are DNA molecules; genes are functionally reduced to DNA molecules. So a functional reduction\nidentifies a functional/causal role with a physical state that realizes it (makes it happen, so to speak) and offers an explanation of\nhow the physical state realizes the functional state.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 31 beliefs and intentions are anchored to observable behaviour, and this feature makes them amenable\nto functional analysis. For instance, if a population of creatures interacts with its environment in a\nsimilar fashion to us (if those creatures interact with one another as we do, produce similar utterances\nand so forth), then we would naturally ascribe to these creatures beliefs, desires, and other intentional\nstates, precisely because intentional properties are functional properties.\nThe second kind of property dualism, which is dualism in a more demanding sense, claims that there\nare two kinds of properties, physical and mental, and that mental properties are something over\nand above physical properties. This in turn can be understood in at least two ways. First, being \u201cover\nand above\u201d can mean that mental properties have independent causal powers, and are responsible for\neffects in the physical world. This is known as \u201cdownward causation.\u201d In this sense, a property dualist\nof this kind must believe that, say, the mental property of having the desire to get a drink is what\nactually causes you to get up and walk to the fridge, in contrast to some material property of your\nbrain being the cause, like the firing of certain groups of neurons. Second, being something \u201cover and\nabove\u201d must imply the denial of supervenience. In other words, for mental properties to be genuinely\nindependent of physical properties, they must be able to vary independently of their physical bases. So\na property dualist who denies supervenience would be committed to the possibility that two people\ncan be in different mental states, e.g., one might be in pain and the other not, while having the same\nbrain states.\nEmergentism is a property dualist view in this more demanding sense. Emergentism first appeared as\na systematic theory in the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury in the work of the so-called \u201cBritish Emergentists,\u201d J.S.Mill (1806 \u20131873), Samuel Alexander\n(1859 \u20131938), C. Lloyd Morgan (1852 \u20131936) and C.D. Broad (1887 \u20131971). Since then it has been\ndefended (and opposed) by many philosophers and scientists, some of whom understand it in different\nways. Still, we can summarize the position by saying that according to emergentism, when a system\nreaches a certain level of complexity, entirely new properties emerge that are novel, irreducible to,\nand something \u201cover and above\u201d the lower level from which they emerged (Vintiadis 2013). For\nexample, when a brain, or a nervous system, becomes complex enough new mental properties, like\nsensations, thoughts and desires, emerge from it in addition to its physical properties. So according\nto emergentism everything that exists is made up of matter but matter can have different kinds of\nproperties, mental and physical, that are genuinely distinct in one or both of the senses described\nabove: that is, either in the sense that mental properties have novel causal powers that are not to be\nfound in physical properties underlying them or in the sense that mental properties do not supervene\non physical properties.\nSome philosophers have argued for the kind of demanding property dualism that denies\nsupervenience by appealing to the conceivability of philosophical zombies\u2014an argument most\nfamously developed by David Chalmers. Philosophical zombies are beings that are behaviorally and\nphysically just like us but that have no \u201cinner\u201d experience. If such beings are not only conceivable but\nalso possible (as Chalmers argues), then it seems that there can be mental differences without physical\ndifferences (1996). If this argument is correct, then phenomenal properties cannot be explained in\nterms of physical properties and they are really distinct from physical properties.\n32 PROPERTYDUALISM OBJECTIONS TO PROPERTY DUALISM\nA main problem for substance dualism was the question of mental causation. Given the view that\nthe mental and the material substance are two discrete kinds of substances the problem that arises\nis that of their interaction, a problem posed by Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia (1618-1680) in her\ncorrespondence with Descartes. How can two different kinds of things have an effect on one another?\nIt seems from what we know from science that physical effects have physical causes. If this is indeed\nthe case, how is it that I can think of my grandmother and cry, or desire a glass of wine and go over to\nthe fridge to pour myself one? How do the mental and the physical interact? The common consensus\nthat substance dualism cannot satisfactorily answer this problem ultimately led many philosophers to\nthe rejection of Cartesian dualism.\nIn the attempt to preserve the mental while also preserving a foothold in the physical, dualism\nof properties was introduced. However, the double requirement of the distinctness of physical\nproperties from mental properties and of the dependence of mental properties on physical properties\nturns out to be a source of problems for property dualism as well.\nThis can be seen in the problem of causal exclusion that is analyzed below. This problem arises for\nproperty dualism and has been put forward by a number of philosophers over the years, most notably\nby Kim himself who, due to this problem, concludes that phenomenal properties that are irreducibly\nmental are also merely epiphenomenal, that is, they have no causal effects on physical events (2005).\nAccording to mind-body supervenience, every time a mental property M is instantiated it supervenes\non a physical property P.\nNow suppose M appears to cause another mental property M\u00b9,\nthe question arises whether the cause of M\u00b9 is indeed M or whether it is M\u00b9\u2019s subjacent base P\u00b9 (since\naccording to supervenience M\u00b9 is instantiated by a physical property P\u00b9).\nAt this point we need to introduce two principles held by physicalists: First, the principle of causal\nclosure according to which the physical world is causally closed. This means that every physical effect\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 33 has a sufficient physical cause that brings it about. Note that this in itself does not exclude non-\nphysical causes since such causes could also be part of the causal history of an effect. What does\nexclude such non-physical causes is a second principle which denies the overdetermination of events.\nAccording to this principle an effect cannot have more than one wholly sufficient cause (it cannot be\noverdetermined) and so this, along with causal closure, leads to the conclusion that when you trace\nthe causes of an effect, all there are are physical causes.\nTo return to our example, given the denial of causal overdetermination, either M or P\u00b9 is the cause\nof M\u00b9\u2014it can\u2019t be both\u2014and so, given the supervenience relation, it seems that M\u00b9 occurs because\nP\u00b9 occurred. Therefore, it seems that M actually causes M\u00b9 by causing the subjacent P\u00b9 (and also that\nmental to mental, or same level, causation presupposes mental to physical, or downward, causation).\nHowever, given the principle of causal closure P\u00b9 must have a sufficient physical cause P.\nBut given exclusion again, P\u00b9 cannot have two sufficient causes, M and P, and so P is the real cause of\nP\u00b9 because if M were the real cause, causal closure would be violated again.\nSo the problem of causal exclusion is that, given supervenience, causal closure and the denial of\noverdetermination, it is not clear how mental properties can be causally efficacious; mental properties\nseem to be epiphenomenal, at best. And while epiphenomenalism is compatible with property dualism\n(since property dualism states that there are two kinds of properties in the world, and\nepiphenomenalism states that some mental properties are causally inert by-products of physical\nproperties, thus accepting the existence of two properties), its coherence comes at the expense of our\ncommon sense intuitions that our mental states affect our physical states and our behavior. It seems\nthen, that, for its critics, as far as mental causation goes, property dualism does not fare much better\nthan substance dualism.\nMore generally, the question of the causal efficacy of mental properties gives rise to the same kinds\nof objections that were raised regarding mental causation in substance dualism. For instance, in\nboth cases mental to physical interaction seems to violate the principle of conservation of energy, a\nprinciple that is considered to be fundamental to our physical science. That is, the conservation law\nwould be violated if mental to physical causation were possible, since such an interaction would have\nto introduce energy to the physical world (assuming, that is, that the physical world is causally closed).\nIt is not in the scope of this discussion to wade into this matter, but it should be noted that this\nobjection is not accepted by everyone; it has been argued that the principle of conservation of energy\n34 PROPERTYDUALISM does not apply universally, for instance by citing examples from general relativity or quantum gravity.\nSimilarly, both the causal closure of the physical and the denial of causal overdetermination have been\nquestioned. Nonetheless, despite these responses, it is fair to say that the question of mental causation\nstill remains one of the major objections to property dualism.\nAnother objection, this time to some views that are considered property dualist views, can be posed\nby asking, \u201cIn what way is property dualism really dualism?\u201d In our distinction between two kinds of\nproperty dualism above, there is a clear sense in which positions of the second kind, like emergentism\nor views that deny supervenience, are property dualist positions. Since, for such views, mental\nproperties are \u201csomething over and above\u201d physical properties; they are distinct from them,\nirreducible to them and not wholly determined by them. So here we have cases of two genuinely\ndifferent kinds of properties, and genuine cases of property dualism.\nHowever, it is not equally clear that non-reductive physicalism can properly be called a kind of\nproperty dualism. The problem is that if mental properties are not something over and above physical\nproperties then it is hard to see this as a genuine version of property dualism. We can see this if we\nlook more closely into the meaning of physicalism.\nPhysicalism is the view that what there fundamentally is is what is described by physics. In this sense,\nmental properties are non-physical properties, since they are not properties to be found in physics.\nBut if non-reductive physicalism claims that there are non-physical properties that are irreducible to\nphysical properties, why should this be considered a case of physicalism? The answer given by the\nnon-reductive physicalist is that this is because such properties are grounded in the physical realm\nthrough the relation of supervenience and that, although mental properties might not be identical to\nphysical properties, they need to be at least in principle explainable in terms of physical properties\n(Horgan 1993). Indeed, non-reductive physicalism is sometimes called token identity theory because\nit claims that tokens (instances) of mental states can be identified with tokens of physical states, even\nif types of mental states are not identical with types of physical states. (An analogy: all instances\nof the property of being beautiful are physical\u2014all beautiful objects are physical objects\u2014but the\nproperty of being beautiful is not a physical property). But now the problem is that, as Tim Crane\nhas argued, if physicalism requires that non-physical properties are explicable (even in principle) in\nphysical terms it is not obvious why this position is a property dualist one, since for there to be\ngenuine property dualism, the ontology of physics should not be enough to explain mental properties\n(2001). So, according to this objection, it seems that the mere denial of the identity of mental and\nphysical properties is not enough for real property dualism, and also that real property dualists must\neither believe in downward causation or deny supervenience or both.\nTo sum up the above discussion, we can say that property dualism is a position that attempts to\npreserve the reality of mental properties while also giving them a foothold in the physical world.\nThe need for this is evident, given the intractable difficulties presented by substance dualism on the\none hand, and the problems faced by the identity theory on the other. However, despite the fact that\nproperty dualism enjoys renewed popularity these days, it is open to important objections that, for its\ncritics, have not been adequately addressed and which render the position problematic.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 35 REFERENCES\nChalmers, David J. 1996.

In front of me, the sky is full of\nthe pink and blue hues of approaching sunset dashed with white clouds. Tropical birds chitter in high-\npitched trills, while a pair of dogs utter guttural barks at each other. My skin alternately prickles with\nthe last lingering heat of the day, interrupted by the pleasant coolness of an evening breeze.\nThe scene I have just described is full of experiences with distinctive qualities\u2014colours, sounds, and\nphysical sensations. These qualities of experience are known to philosophers of mind as qualia, an\noddly obscure term for an aspect of our lives that could scarcely be more familiar to us. Every waking\nmoment of our lives, we are experiencing various qualia associated with sights, sounds, or feelings.\nSometimes, we deliberately seek out new qualia, as when we order an unfamiliar dish at a restaurant,\neager to learn what it tastes like. On other occasions, we seek urgently to put an end to some quale\n(the singular of \u201cqualia\u201d) or another; for example, when we take an aspirin to relieve the throbbing\nsensation of a headache.\nQualia have been the focus of intense interest in philosophy of mind and cognitive science for several\ndecades. They possess several apparent features that make them both fascinating and hard to explain.\nAll of these properties are controversial (see section 4 below), but they certainly seem to capture\nseveral of the intuitive features of qualia.\nFirst, qualia seem to be private: my qualia are a feature of my experience alone, and you can never\ndirectly access them. You may have wondered in the past whether other people experience colours\nin just the same way you do, or whether my blue may be your green. These questions arise precisely\nbecause of the apparent privacy of qualia. We can never know which qualia other people are\nexperiencing.\nSecond (and related), qualia are arguably ineffable; that is, they cannot neatly be put into words.\nImagine trying to explain to a person who is blind what red looks like, or (a less extreme example)\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 37 conveying to a lifelong vegetarian what tuna tastes like. While in both cases, we might attempt to use\nmetaphors (\u201cred is like a trumpet\u201d) to convey the character of the experience, our attempts to do so\nwill inevitably fail to do justice to the relevant sensation.\nA final alleged property is that qualia are immediately and fully apprehensible to us just by\nexperiencing them. In this respect, they are distinct from the objects of our experience. Imagine that\nyou are lying in bed at night and hear a soft thud. You may well wonder what the noise was: a falling\nobject, a door slamming in the wind, or perhaps your housemate returning home. What you don\u2019t\nhave to speculate about, however, is what the noise sounded like to you. This is something you grasped\nsimply by hearing it. More strongly and more controversially, some philosophers have suggested that\nwe can never make errors of judgment about our qualia. If I say something feels painful to me, for\nexample, then it is nonsensical to suggest I might be in error.\nQUALIA AND THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM\nOne reason qualia have so fascinated philosophers is that they are arguably hard to explain in standard\nscientific terms. Many of us have probably heard neuroscientists talking about things like synapses,\nneurons, and different regions of the brain. It is perhaps not too difficult to see how this kind of\nscientific approach might explain various aspects of our behavior. We might understand perception,\nfor example, in terms of the transmission of information from the sense organs through various\nprocessing areas of the brain, or unusual aggression in terms of the release of some hormone or\nneurotransmitter. It is much harder to see, however, how these kinds of scientific descriptions could\never give us a satisfying explanation of why red looks the specific way that it does, or why cinnamon\ntastes like this and vanilla like that.\nThe challenge here is not merely to explain the neuroscience of how vision works or how our tongue\nrelates flavour information to the brain. Important progress is being made every day in understanding\nquestions like these, although the science still has a long way to go. Instead, the real difficulty is\nthat while science tells us about how the brain works, it seems unable to tell us what experiences are\nactually like. To get an idea of the problem, imagine a person who has been completely deaf since birth\nwho wants to know what Beethoven sounds like. Even if we had perfect brain-scanners and could\nshow them exactly what happens to someone\u2019s neurons when they listen to music, it does not seem\nlike this could ever properly convey to them the subjective experience of hearing the opening bars of\nthe Choral Symphony.\nThis creates an apparent challenge for a scientific worldview. If science cannot fully explain qualia,\nthen does it follow that science can only offer us a partial understanding of the universe? More\nstrongly, one might wonder whether the seeming inexplicability of qualia in scientific terms shows\nthat the universe we inhabit does not consist solely of things like atoms, molecules, forces, and other\nobjects from the domain of science, but also contains distinctive, irreducibly mental phenomena.\nThe challenge is well illustrated by a famous thought experiment called \u201cMary\u2019s Room\u201d developed\n1\nby philosopher Frank Jackson (1982). Imagine a woman called Mary who is a brilliant scientist.\nSpecifically, we are told that she knows all the physical facts about color perception: she knows all\n1. Mary\u2019s Room is also discussed in Chapter 4.\n38 QUALIA&RAWFEELS about the physics of light, the biology of the eye, and the neuroscience of color processing in the brain.\nHowever, Mary has never seen color herself, having spent her life in a black and white room. One day,\nMary leaves her room, and sees a shiny red apple for the first time. \u201cWow!\u201d she thinks, \u201cSo that\u2019s what\nred looks like.\u201d\nMary\u2019s Room attempts to demonstrate that there are certain facts that can\u2019t be accessed by scientific\nknowledge alone. After all, Mary already knows all the scientific facts about color before she leaves\nher room. What she lacks, however, is knowledge of the qualia of color; that is, what colors actually\nlook like. She only gains this knowledge when she leaves the room and actually sees colors herself.\nHence, the argument runs, there are certain facts that cannot be explained by science, but instead rely\non subjective experience. The argument can be presented formally as follows.\n1. Mary knows all the scientific facts about color before she leaves her room.\n2. Mary learns new facts (about what colors look like) when she leaves her room.\n3. Therefore, not all facts are scientific facts.\nMary\u2019s Room is one of the most famous thought experiments in all of philosophy and has generated\na vast number of responses. Most of them challenge premise (2), above, and argue that in fact Mary\ndoesn\u2019t learn anything new when she leaves her room.\nFor example, the ability hypothesis claims that what Mary gains is not knowledge but a new set of\nabilities (Lewis 1990). Imagine someone who knows a lot about music, but can\u2019t play any instruments.\nHowever, after lots of practice, they learn to play the piano. The ability hypothesis suggests that\nsomething like this applies to Mary. Prior to leaving her room, she had never seen red objects, so\ncouldn\u2019t recognize a given object as red, or imagine or remember the color red. After leaving the\nroom, her new experiences of red allow her to do all of this. Our sense that she gains knowledge, then,\nis misplaced\u2014what she gains is a new kind of skill. Some philosophers doubt that this adequately\nexplains away our sense that Mary really does gain a new special kind of knowledge when she leaves\nher black and white room.\n2\nAnother important approach we can term the old fact, new knowledge view. Imagine someone\nknows that Istanbul was founded in 330AD. They then learn quite separately that Constantinople\nwas founded in 330AD. Assuming they do not already know that Istanbul and Constantinople are\nthe same city, it seems reasonable to say that the person learned something new when they heard the\ninformation about Constantinople. Certainly, they have an item of trivia at their disposal that they\ndidn\u2019t have before. However, since \u201cConstantinople\u201d in fact refers to the same city as \u201cIstanbul,\u201d we\nshould also say that they have not strictly learned any new fact about the universe, having instead\n2. See, e.g., Michael Tye, Ten Problems of Consciousness, 171-77 (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995).\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 39 encountered a fact she already knew in a different form. Applied to the Mary case, the idea is that\nMary really did know all facts about color before she left her room. When she sees red for the first\ntime, she simply encounters these same facts in a new way, namely via her own color vision rather\nthan via the theoretical language of science. One challenge for this view is to offer a developed account\nof this special experiential way of gaining knowledge while avoiding appeal to any non-scientific or\nnon-physical facts or properties.\nA final approach adopted by some defiant philosophers is to insist that Mary would not gain any kind\nof new knowledge or ability toward the world when she leaves her room. If she really knew all the\nscientific facts about color before leaving the room, she would in fact already have all the knowledge\nand abilities associated with seeing colors, despite never having personally seen them (Dennett 2006).\nThis might sound like a flat denial of the powerful intuition motivating the thought experiment. One\nway to make this approach more persuasive, however, is to focus on the first premise of the argument\nabove, that Mary knows all relevant the scientific facts. Is this really something we can easily imagine?\nAfter all, current science is still incomplete, and falls far short of providing us with knowledge of every\nfact even within its own domain of explanation. Moreover, most scientists are so specialized they\nknow only a small proportion of the facts within their own field. Mary, then, would have be more like\na superintelligence from the distant future than a normal human. Given this, should our intuitions\nabout what we can imagine be given much weight?\nThese responses are only a fraction of the many approaches to Mary\u2019s Room adopted by philosophers.\nWhile considerable progress has been made in developing rebuttals to Mary\u2019s Room, it is probably\nfair to say that there is no one response that has been generally accepted as solving the problem. The\npuzzle of qualia for the scientific worldview, then, remains a central area of philosophical research.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF QUALIA ARE THERE?\nA further important debate about qualia concerns which kinds of mental states actually have them.\nThe usual examples of qualia are things like sights, sounds, and bodily sensations. But some\nphilosophers have argued that there are plenty of other kinds of qualia besides these.\nSome example candidates for these additional qualia are things like emotions. It certainly seems like\nthere is a distinctive feeling (or set of feelings) associated with powerful emotions like joy, anger,\nor sadness, for example. However, it remains controversial whether these feelings involve a special\nkind of qualia all of their own, or might be understood instead in terms of other qualia, such as, for\nexample, those associated with bodily sensations, a view adopted by one of the founders of modern\npsychology, William James (1842-1910), in a famous article (1884). Note, for example, the intense\nphysical sensations that accompany the emotion of excitement: we may experience the feeling of our\nheart rate going up, our mouth becoming dry, and our muscles tensing. Could such \u201cbodily qualia\u201d be\nall there is to the qualia of emotions? The issue remains hotly debated.\nAnother important debate concerns the range or type of qualia associated with perception. We can\nall agree that there are qualia associated with our experiences of color and shape, for example. But\ncould there be special kinds of qualia involved in seeing someone as looking friendly, for example,\nor in recognizing an animal as a raccoon? The idea that there are such \u201chigh-level\u201d qualia associated\n40 QUALIA&RAWFEELS with properties beyond things like color, shape, and motion is sometimes called the rich content\nview (Siegel 2010). One way to motivate this idea comes from cases where the character of our\nexperience\u2014in other words, our qualia\u2014seems to change despite there being no changes in how we\nare experiencing the lower level qualities of color, shape, and so on.\nConsider, for example, the famous \u201cduck-rabbit\u201d illusion below (Jastrow 1899). With a little mental\neffort, we can \u201cswitch\u201d from seeing the picture as a duck to seeing it as a rabbit, and it arguably seems\nlike there is a shift in the way the picture looks. However, it is far from clear that our experience of the\nlow-level features of the image\u2014the colors and shapes\u2014actually changes. If that is right, then it might\nprovide evidence that there are special kinds of qualia associated with seeing the image as a duck and\nseeing it as a rabbit.\nA final important debate concerns whether non-perceptual states like thinking and understanding\nmight have special qualia associated with them. For example, quickly add together the numbers\n17 and 48 in your head, and in doing so, consider what feelings or qualities are associated with\nthe experience. Was there a distinctive kind of feeling that accompanied your thoughts about the\nnumbers? Some philosophers have suggested that there is indeed a kind of special experience\n3\nassociated with thinking and understanding. One argument for this kind of \u201ccognitive qualia\u201d (or\ncognitive phenomenology, as it is also known) comes from cases of hearing a foreign language.\nImagine that Jack, an English speaker, and Jacques, a French speaker, are both listening to a French\nradio broadcast. Jack cannot understand what he is hearing, but Jacques can. Intuitively, it seems\nlike there is a difference in the quality of their two experiences arising from the differences in their\nunderstanding (or lack thereof). Again, the existence of these cognitive qualia is hotly contested.\nSome philosophers claim, for example, that the qualities associated with experiences like thinking and\nunderstanding can be understood just in terms of regular perceptual qualia, like colors and shapes,\n3. See Galen Strawson, Mental Reality (MIT Press, 1994), Ch.1.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 41 occurring as images in our minds. Hence, perhaps any qualia you experienced in thinking through the\nmath problem above were just a matter of seeing or hearing the numbers in your \u201cmind\u2019s eye.\u201d\nSKEPTICISM ABOUT QUALIA\nWe have been talking in this chapter about qualia as though their existence, at least, was\nuncontroversial. In one sense, that is surely true: no one could deny that we genuinely experience\ncolors and tastes, for example. Some philosophers remain skeptical about qualia, however, insisting\nthat the very idea is a confused one. The philosopher Daniel Dennett is one such famous skeptic. In a\nclassic paper, \u201cQuining Qualia,\u201d he gives a number of examples of cases in which the idea of qualia as\nused by philosophers seems to invite impossible and perhaps nonsensical questions (1988). Consider,\nfor example, the case of two people, one of whom loves cauliflower, and the other of whom despises\nit. Should we say in such an instance that they must therefore have different qualia when they taste\ncauliflower, or instead say that they have different reactions to the same qualia? Dennett would have\nus believe that such questions barely make sense.\nTo illustrate the point further, he invites us to imagine that we ourselves go from despising cauliflower\nto loving it (an experience many of us have had with one food item or another). Even in such a case,\nhe suggests, we are not able to say whether our qualia have changed or our attitudes have changed. If\nthat is right, then it seems that some questions about qualia cannot be answered from the first-person\nperspective; but given that qualia are supposedly private and ineffable, it would seem to follow that\nthey cannot be answered at all! Rather than embrace such mysterious entities, Dennett suggests, we\nwould do better to abandon the very idea of qualia as confused.\nAnother kind of skepticism about qualia concerns their relationship to the objects of our experience.\nFor a long time, many philosophers thought of qualia as things we could observe in our experience\nin their own right, quite separate from our experience of objects in the world (hence the term \u201craw\nfeels\u201d sometimes used to describe them). Other philosophers have more recently challenged this idea,\ninstead claiming that insofar as we experience qualia at all, we experience them as properties of\nobjects in the world (Harman 1990). This is a complex debate, but in essence, these philosophers claim\nthat in looking at a green tree, we do not experience \u201craw greenness.\u201d Rather, what we might call\nthe \u201cqualia of greenness\u201d are actually experienced as properties of an object in the world, namely the\ntree itself. If this transparency thesis is correct, then it suggests that even if qualia exist, they might\nsimply be an aspect of our awareness of real objects in the world, rather than some mysterious \u201cmental\npaint\u201d (Block 1996). If so, cognitive science might enable us to understand qualia via the broader\nphilosophical and scientific project of explaining how perception makes us aware of the world.\nCONCLUSION\nQualia remain one of the deepest puzzles in all of philosophy, and this chapter has only offered a\ncursory survey of some of the most important debates in which they feature. Even while science has\ngiven us tremendous new insights into difficult questions like the origins of the universe and the\nhuman genome, the problem of how to explain qualia seems still tantalizingly out of reach of standard\nscientific enquiry. Despite or perhaps because of this, many philosophers and scientists view qualia as\na vital and exciting frontier for human understanding.\n42 QUALIA&RAWFEELS REFERENCES\nBlock, Ned. 1996. \u201cMental Paint and Mental Latex.\u201d Philosophical Issues 7(19).\nDennett, Daniel C. 2006. \u201cWhat Robomary Knows.\u201d In Phenomenal Concepts and Phenomenal Knowledge:\nNew Essays on Consciousness and Physicalism, ed.

We say things like \u201care you aware that \u2026\u201d often. Sometimes\nwe say \u201chave you noticed that \u2026 ?\u201d to express similar thoughts, and this indicates a close connection\nbetween consciousness (awareness) and attention (noticing), which we will come back to later in this\nchapter. Ned Block, one of the key figures in this area, provides a useful characterization of what\nhe calls \u201cphenomenal consciousness.\u201d For him, phenomenal consciousness is experience. Experience\ncovers perceptions, e.g., when we see, hear, touch, smell, and taste, we typically have experiences,\nsuch as seeing colors and smelling odors. It also covers bodily awareness, e.g., we typically have\nexperiences of our own bodily temperature and positions of limbs. Consciousness is primarily about\nthis experiential aspect of our mental lives.\nMost discussions of philosophy of mind rely on the idea of conscious experience on some level.\nDescartes reported his conscious experiences in his Meditations on First Philosophy. These figured\ncentrally into his arguments that he has a mind (Chapter 1). Behaviorism, materialism, functionalism,\nand property dualism seek to explain our mental lives, so they will need to include consciousness, as\nit is one of the most important elements of mentality (Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4). Qualia and\nraw feels are one way to understand consciousness; since they have been covered earlier (Chapter\n5), we will not discuss them here. Knowledge, belief, and other mental states are sometimes, though\nnot always conscious, so it is important to understand the difference between (say) conscious and\nunconscious beliefs. This also applies to concepts and content (Chapter 7). Whether freedom of the\nwill and the self require consciousness is highly debated (Chapter 8). In this way, it can be seen that\nconsciousness has a central place in philosophy of mind.\nCONCEPTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nThere are many concepts of consciousness; in general there are two approaches. First, one can\nsurvey folk concepts of consciousness: how lay people use the term, and how they use other related\n44 PHILOSOPHYOFMIND terms (e.g., awareness) to refer to similar phenomena. Second, one can search for useful concepts\nof consciousness for explaining or understanding the mind. The former approach is conducted\nin experimental philosophy, a relatively new branch of philosophy, which invokes experimental\nmethods to survey people\u2019s concepts, including those who are from diverse cultural and linguistic\nbackgrounds. In this chapter, we will rather focus on the latter approach, which is traditionally\nfavored by philosophers of mind.\nPhilosophers have different ways of picking out various concepts of consciousness, and they tend\nto strongly disagree with one another. No division is entirely uncontroversial. However, there is\none distinction that tends to be the starting point of philosophical discussions about consciousness;\neven those who disagree with this way of carving out of the territory often start from here. It is the\ndistinction from Block (1995) on phenomenal and access consciousness:\nPhenomenal consciousness [P-consciousness] is experience; what makes a state phenomenally conscious is\nthat there is something \u201cit is like\u201d (Nagel 1974) to be in that state. (Block 1995, 228)\nA perceptual state is access-conscious [A-conscious], roughly speaking, if its content\u2014what is represented by\nthe perceptual state\u2014is processed via that information-processing function, that is, if its content gets to the\n1\nExecutive System, whereby it can be used to control reasoning and behavior. (1995, 229)\n2\nBlock also discusses a third concept of consciousness, called \u201cmonitoring consciousness\u201d (1995, 235).\nIn order to be focused, we will restrict ourselves to the division between phenomenal and access\nconsciousness.\nBlock\u2019s main point is to dissociate P-consciousness and A-consciousness: he seeks to make the case\nthat these two kinds of consciousness are different in kind. In order to do so, he first tries to find cases\nin which P-consciousness exists while A-consciousness is absent:\n[S]uppose you are engaged in intense conversation when suddenly at noon you realize that right outside\nyour window there is\u2014and has always been for sometime\u2014a deafening pneumatic drill digging up the street.\nYou were aware of the noise all along, but only at noon are you consciously aware of it. That is, you were\nP-conscious of the noise all along, but at noon you are both P-conscious and A-conscious of it. (1995, 234;\noriginal emphasis)\nFor A-consciousness without P-consciousness, Block argues that it is hard to find any actual case, but\nit is \u201cconceptually possible\u201d (1995, 233), meaning that there is no incoherence in the scenario in which\nA-consciousness exists while P-consciousness is absent. This strategy is effective since what he wants\nto argue is that these two kinds of consciousness are distinct: for this purpose, there is no need to have\nactual cases in which one exists while the other is absent, though actual cases do help as they serve as\nexistential proofs.\nAnother distinction that needs to be in place is from David Chalmers (1995). He poses a challenge\nto researchers of consciousness with the distinction between the \u201ceasy problems\u201d and the \u201chard\nproblems\u201d of consciousness. According to Chalmers,\n[t]he easy problems of consciousness are those that seem directly susceptible to the standard methods of\n1. For more on representation and content, see Chapter 7.\n2. For more concepts of consciousness, see Tye (2003).\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 45 cognitive science, whereby a phenomenon is explained in terms of computational or neural mechanisms.\nThe hard problems are those that seem to resist those methods. (1995, 4)\nHere are some examples of the easy problems he provides:\nThe integration of information by a cognitive system;\nThe reportability of mental states;\nThe ability of a system to access its own internal states;\nThe focus of attention (1995).\nBoth the easy problems and the hard problems interest philosophers. Block\u2019s discussion of P- and A-\nconsciousness can be seen as primarily in the territory of easy problems, while Chapters 1 to 5 of this\nbook can be seen as more about the hard problems.\nNow, with these two basic distinctions at hand, it is time to see how philosophers and scientists\ntheorize about different kinds of consciousness, especially phenomenal consciousness.\nTHEORIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nBlock seeks to dissociate P- and A-consciousness. He has several argumentative lines; the most\nrelevant one has it that P-consciousness cannot be explained by representational contents. To\nunderstand what this amounts to, one needs to have some basic grip on what representational\ncontents are. Again, examples will help. Two beliefs are different because they have different contents:\nmy belief that tomorrow will rain and that the day after tomorrow will not rain are different beliefs\nbecause their contents\u2014\u201ctomorrow will rain\u201d and \u201cthe day after tomorrow will not rain\u201d\u2014are\ndifferent. These contents are said to represent states of affairs, including actual ones and imaginary\nones. Contents can be true or false: my belief that tomorrow it will rain can fail to be true simply\nbecause tomorrow it will not rain. Representational content itself is a complex topic that cannot\nbe handled in this chapter; it will be the subject matter of Chapter 7. There can be many reasons\nfor believing that P-consciousness cannot be explained by representational contents, one being that\nan experience and a belief can share the same content, but have different phenomenology. This is\n3\ndebatable. Some would argue that experiences do not have representational content.\nNow, content and consciousness are two major topics in philosophy of mind. Another main figure in\nthis area, Daniel Dennett, has them as his first book\u2019s title (1969). They are often studied separately,\nbut some philosophers have attempted to invoke one to explain the other. The most prominent\nposition, exemplified by Fred Dretske (1995), holds that representational content is relatively easier to\nunderstand, since it can be explained by naturalistic notions such as information; it is naturalistic in\nthe sense that natural sciences would find those notions scientifically respectable. This view further\nholds that consciousness should be understood through representational content, so that it is fully\nnaturalized. This view is representationalism. The canonical statement of it is that \u201call mental facts are\nrepresentational facts\u201d (Dretske 1995, xiii). This is the \u201cnaturalizing the mind\u201d project. Now, although\nBlock is all for the naturalization project, he objects to this specific way of naturalizing consciousness.\n3. See Travis (2004), for example.\n46 CONSCIOUSNESS The basic intuition is that representationalism leaves something crucial out: the what-it-is-like-ness of\nexperience. This is because, for example, beliefs with representational contents can be unconscious.\nOr again: some hold that experiences do not have content.\nAlthough Block and others have been resisting representationalism, it is still the most prominent view\nin this area. This is presumably because it offers the most promising line of naturalizing the mind,\naccording to many. This is important as one of the main motives in twentieth-century philosophy is\nto situate the mind in the physical world (more on this in Chapters 1-5). Now, this prominent theory\ncomes in various forms, which each of the following sections will summarize.\nFirst-Order Representationalism\nThis is the view that representational content can exclusively explain phenomenal consciousness\n(Dretske 1995, Tye 1995). It is either argued that they are identical, or the latter supervenes on the\nformer. Supervenience is another technical concept that can be seen in many areas in philosophy.\nSuppose A is the supervenience base, and B is said to supervene on A. In this case, if B has any change,\nit has to be because there is some change in A. But the other way around is not true: it can happen\nthat B stays the same while A has changed. This is a specific way to explain the dependence relation.\nIt would help to see this with a concrete example. In ethics, it has been argued that facts in ethics,\ne.g., torturing is wrong, have solid status because they supervene on facts in physics. In this case, if\nethical facts have any change, it has to be because there are some changes in physical facts. But the\nother way around is not true: it can happen that ethical facts stay the same while physical facts have\nchanged. The same move has been invoked in explaining aesthetic facts. This notion of supervenience\nseems to capture what we need for the dependence relation: physical facts are the most fundamental,\nso if other facts change, it has to be due to changes in physical facts. But different physical facts\ncan sustain the same ethical, aesthetic, and mental facts. This is one powerful thought that is behind\nrepresentationalism.\nHigher-Order Representationalism\nHigher-order theories in general hold that a state is conscious in virtue of being accompanied by\nother states. How to characterize the relevant sense of \u201caccompany\u201d is of course a difficult and\ncontroversial matter (Rosenthal 2005). One crucial motivation for higher-order theories is David\nRosenthal\u2019s observation that \u201cmental states are conscious only if one is in some way conscious of\nthem\u201d (2005, 4; my emphasis). He calls this the \u201ctransitivity principle.\u201d Notice that \u201conly if\u201d signifies\na particular logical relation: \u201cA only if B\u201d means B is necessary for A. So this principle says that one\u2019s\n4\nconsciousness of some mental states is a necessary condition of those mental states being conscious.\nHigher-order theories come in many varieties. The basic question is about the nature of the relevant\nhigher-order states. They are either conceived as perception or thought. The former can be found in\nArmstrong (1968) and Lycan (1996), and it is also called the \u201cinner sense theory.\u201d The idea is that just\nlike ordinary perceptions (outer sense), the internal consciousness-making states are also perceptual\n(inner sense). What is crucial here is that perception is a lower level state comparing with thought.\nOne merit of this version is that perception is more primitive than thoughts, so it can more easily\n4. Also see Lycan (1996).\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 47 accommodate the case of non-linguistic animals, since they can perceive but might not be able to\nthink.\nThe latter\u2014higher-order thought theories\u2014has two versions. Rosenthal (2005) holds that\nphenomenally conscious mental states are the objects of higher-order thoughts. This is actualist.\nCarruthers (2005) holds that phenomenally conscious mental states are available to higher-order\nthoughts. This is dispositionalist. The distinction between actual and dispositional is also important\nin many areas in philosophy. Think about documents in your laptop. Since you have the relevant\npasswords, those documents are accessible or available to you, but it does not mean that at any\nspecific moment you are accessing any specific document. Putting it bluntly, for the actualist, only\nthose mental states that I am actually accessing at any given moment are conscious, while for the\ndispositionalist, any mental states that I could at some point access are conscious. In general, the\ndispositional accounts are less demanding than the actualist accounts, simply because dispositional\nnotions are in general weaker. But all these higher-order theories can be classified as versions of\nrepresentationalism, since both perceptions and thoughts have contents, according to most views.\nReflexive Representationalism\nThis view might be difficult differentiate from higher-order theories. The basic idea is that\nphenomenally conscious mental states themselves possess higher-order representational contents\nthat represent the states themselves (Kriegel 2009). The main merit of this view is that it does not\nduplicate mental states: the contents are part of the relevant conscious states. For example, my visual\nexperience of seeing the book in front of me has some specific conscious phenomenology, and also\nthe content that there is a book in front of me. This view would say that this visual experience has the\nphenomenology it does due to the content it possesses. This group of ideas come in so many varieties\nthat we cannot cover them here, but it is worth bearing in mind that this should not be conflated with\nhigher-order theories.\nIt is controversial whether the next two groups should be classified as representationalism. This\nchapter doesn\u2019t take a stand with regard to this further question.\nCognitive Theories\nThis group of ideas invokes cognition to understand consciousness. In a way it is quite similar to\nstandard representationalism, since contents are often attributed to cognitive states such as beliefs.\nHowever, they are crucially different in that cognitive theories typically do not invoke\nrepresentational content, which is primarily a notion from philosophy. The most famous cognitive\ntheory is proposed by scientist Bernard Baars (1988): according to this view, consciousness emerges\nfrom competitions among processors and outputs for a limited working memory capacity that\nbroadcasts information for access in a \u201cglobal workspace.\u201d One can think of the model with the\nanalogy from digital computers. This is quite similar to Dennett\u2019s multiple drafts model, according\nto which different probes would elicit different answers about the subject\u2019s conscious states (1991).\nThey are similar in the sense that both theories invoke cognitive notions to explain consciousness.\nCognitive theories tend to be quite naturalistic, though they do not use representational contents\nto explain consciousness. Block argues against cognitive theories with similar reasons against\nrepresentational views, i.e., they cannot capture the what-it-is-like-ness of experience.\n48 CONSCIOUSNESS Information Integration Theory\nMost researchers agree that information must play some role in the complete theory of consciousness,\nbut exactly what role it plays is controversial. Information Integration Theory, or IIT, is a view that\nassigns a very significant role to information proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi (2008). He\nargues that the relevant kind of information integration is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.\nAccording to this view, consciousness is a purely information-theoretic property of cognitive systems,\ni.e., no other notion is more fundamental in this regard. The details of this theory are quite technical,\nand it needs to be further developed as it is quite young. Some have also compared it with\npanpsychism, the view that consciousness is one of the most fundamental properties of the world\n(Chalmers 1996). But we need to bear in mind that every theory is distinctive and needs to be\nunderstood in its own terms.\nThis ends our summary of some major theories of consciousness. It is not supposed to be\ncomprehensive, and each theory discussed above has many more details that need to be taken\nseriously. This summary, and this chapter as a whole, serve only as a starting point for further\nexploration.\nATTENTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS\nAt the beginning of this chapter, we saw that there are potential connections between attention\nand consciousness. Typically, chapters on consciousness do not discuss attention. Since 2010 or so,\nhowever, philosophical discussions of attention have become more widespread, so it makes sense to\ndiscuss it in relation to consciousness, even if only briefly.\nBefore the 1990s, \u201cconsciousness\u201d was a term that scientists tried to stay away from. It was regarded as\nunscientific, as there was no respectable way to give it a satisfactory operational definition, i.e., it was\ndifficult to give a definition that was grounded in empirical evidence. Back then, scientists studied\nattention instead, as it was easier to quantify it, or so it seemed. Empirical studies of attention have\nbeen fruitful since the 1960s. Now, although scientists tried hard to avoid talking about consciousness\nexplicitly, it was not possible to ignore it entirely. For example, when psychologist Max Coltheart\ndefines \u201cvisible persistence\u201d (1980), it is hard to understand what we should mean by \u201cvisible\u201d if it\nis different from \u201cconsciously seen,\u201d though there can indeed be other interpretations, such as \u201cable\nto be seen.\u201d But one wonders whether that should mean \u201cable to be consciously seen.\u201d Of course there\nare subtleties here; for example Block (2007) further distinguishes between visible persistence and\nphenomenal persistence, which makes one wonder how to understand visible persistence exactly. But\nin any case, before the 1990s or so, attention was intensely studied by scientists, and in a way it served\nas a surrogate for consciousness, as attention is more scientifically respectable according to many.\nThe situation has dramatically changed. Nowadays consciousness studies are pervasive not only\nin sciences but also in philosophy. The reasons for this are complicated; it is not simply because\nnowadays consciousness can be better defined in sciences. (I shall not touch on this complex history\nhere.) Now the question concerning the relation between attention and consciousness arises: Are\nthey identical? If not, how do they relate to each other? It is hard to maintain that they are identical,\nas there seem to be clear cases in which a subject, not necessarily a human subject, can focus its\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 49 attention while being unconscious of the target. Perhaps that subject is a simple organism that is\nnot conscious in the relevant sense, but arguably it has certain basic attentional capacities, i.e., they\ncan deploy their cognitive resources to focus on specific targets. Normally the question is more\nabout whether attention is necessary and/or sufficient for consciousness. Jesse Prinz (2012) argues\nfor this strong view, and sometimes he comes close to the identity view. This view faces two basic\nchallenges: Some have argued that attention is not necessary for consciousness; the phenomenological\noverflow view held by Block (2007) is one such view. Some have argued that attention is not sufficient\nfor consciousness; Robert Kentridge and colleagues (1999) have argued that the case of\nblindsight\u2014patients who are blind in certain parts of their visual fields due to cortical damages\u2014is\nattention without awareness, since these patients exemplify clear markers of attention, while the\npatients themselves also insist that they are unconscious of the relevant parts of the visual fields. Now,\nthese are all highly debatable and there is much room to disagree (Cheng 2017). Both consciousness\nand attention are still heated topics nowadays, and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future.\nREFERENCES\nArmstrong, David. 1968. A Materialist Theory of the Mind.

That\nis, sentences, thoughts, or concepts, among others, display intentionality in that they are about\nsomething else; they are said to be a representation of something. The notion of intentionality can\nbe traced back at least as far as Aristotle (384 BCE-322 BCE), though the German philosopher Franz\nBrentano (1838-1917) is generally credited with introducing the notion to contemporary philosophy\nin the late nineteenth century. Brentano\u2019s oft-quoted remark is that \u201cEvery mental phenomenon is\ncharacterized by \u2026 the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object\u201d and \u201creference to a content,\ndirection toward an object.\u201d In other words, \u201cEvery mental phenomenon includes something as object\nwithin itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented,\nin judgement something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so\non\u201d (Brentano [1874] 1995, 68). The usual way to frame the problem of intentionality is in terms of\nthe notion of meaning or content. What is the status of the meaning of a sentence over and above\nits formal and syntactic aspects? What makes it the case that a particular proposition has the content\nthat it does? Is content only dependent upon mind-internal properties? Or must we make use of\nmind-external factors such as the context of the utterance or the speaker\u2019s social history in order to\ndetermine the content? Those who argue that the relevant and scientifically interesting properties\nthat are involved in content are overwhelmingly, though not entirely, within the mind are referred\nto as internalists. On the other hand, externalists argue that there is something more to content than\nmerely mind-internal events and their happenstance connection to the world: externalists insist that\nthe meanings of our words (or sentences, or the contents of our thoughts, etc.) depend on some\ndeep metaphysical (perhaps causal) connection between the mind and other worldly objects that are\nindependent of the mind.\nExternalists argue that a theory of content needs to provide an account of the relation between\nlinguistic expressions and what may be called things in the world. In other words, the claim is that in\norder to explain content we must provide an account of the relation between linguistic expressions\n52 PHILOSOPHYOFMIND and the things that they can be used to talk about. Or as Colin McGinn puts it: \u201c[E]xternalism supposes\nthere to be a deep connection between states of mind and conditions in the nonmental world. Is\nthe mind fundamentally autonomous with respect to the world, or does the world enter into the\nvery nature of the mind?\u201d (McGinn 1989, 1) He remarks further that according to externalism, \u201cThe\nenvironment is thus held to be constitutive of the very nature of mental states, determining what they\nare.\u201d McGinn argues that internalism \u201cinsists upon \u2026 drawing a sharp line between mind and world;\nbut the externalist holds that the mind is penetrated by the world, configured by it\u201d (1989, 3). That\nsaid, however, we will see that the main force and substance of the internalist position is not exactly a\nmirror image or a negation of the externalist position, for internalism only denies that there is a deep\nmetaphysical relation between the things in the world and linguistic expressions. That is, internalists\ndispute the externalist claim that the relations between linguistic expressions and the things in the\nworld are desirable or even tractable in an explanatory theory of content.\nThis chapter is structured as follows. First I discuss the nature of concepts. I then discuss externalism\nand the way in which it explains the nature of concepts and their content. I discuss one of the major\nthought experiments that have motivated many philosophers to adopt the externalist position. I then\ndiscuss the internalist position, which not only provides objections to the main claims of externalism\nbut also provides its own positive account of concepts and their content.\nWHAT IS A CONCEPT?\nA concept is generally understood in the philosophy of mind to refer to a constituent of thought.\nConsider the proposition \u201cJohn thinks that the book is on the table.\u201d Following Bertrand Russell\n(1872-1970), philosophers speak of propositional attitudes, which include beliefs, desires, hopes,\nfears, expectations, and any other attitude that involves a proposition. A propositional attitude of\nthe form \u201cX thinks that P\u201d has two parts. The first constitutes the verb of the psychological-state\ndescription and contains information about the agent and the agent\u2019s psychological state. That is,\nthe first part gives information about who takes which propositional attitude (for example, \u201cJohn\nthinks\u201d). The second part completes the description by revealing what the proposition is, or what the\nattitude refers to (for example, \u201cthat the book is on the table\u201d). Concepts are said to be the constituents\nof the propositions expressed by propositional attitudes (in this case the concepts are, roughly,\n\u201cbook,\u201d \u201ctable,\u201d and \u201con\u201d). Propositional attitudes and thus concepts are used in folk psychological (or\nintentional) explanations of behavior.\nA simple example of the explanations and predictions that folk psychology allows is as follows.\nSuppose that we wish to explain why Leila chose to take her umbrella with her when she departed\ntoday. We can make use of some propositional attitudes and certain laws of folk psychology to\nformulate such an explanation. For instance, Leila believes that it will rain today (perhaps she heard\nthe weather forecast on the radio), Leila believes that using an umbrella will help her seek shelter\nfrom rain, Leila desires not to get wet today. Therefore, since, all things being equal, humans act in\naccordance with their beliefs and desires, we can explain why Leila took her umbrella with her today.\nIn other words, she took the umbrella because she believed X and desired Y, and believed that by\ndoing Z she can bring it about that Y (notice that this is a counterfactual, so that if she did not believe\nthat X and did not desire that Y then she would not do Z). Since beliefs and desires are integral parts\nof human thought, and since beliefs, say, are thought of as expressing propositions, the central role\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 53 of concepts in philosophy and psychology is clear. That is, since the constituents of propositions are\nconcepts, the need to explain the nature of concepts is inseparable from a theory of how the mind\nworks.\nConcepts are clearly shared between different people, and the question of what it is that is shared\ncan be understood as the question of what the nature of content is. That is, if both John and Leila\nthink that P, then they both share the content inherent in the concepts of the proposition P. What\nthis claim amounts to is cashed out in very different ways by externalists and internalists, especially\nin terms of what explanatory role content is supposed to play. Externalists are mostly interested in\nconcepts insofar as they figure in explanations of behavior (linguistic or other), whereas internalists\nare interested in concepts insofar as they serve as the meanings of linguistic items. Thus, a focus\nof internalist semantics is the underlying mechanisms of conceptual structure in virtue of which\nlanguage production and comprehension is made possible. Let us now see what each claim amounts\nto.\nEXTERNALIST EXPLANATIONS OF CONTENT\nSince the 1970\u2019s externalism has become a widely held position in the philosophy of mind. The classic\narguments for externalism are found in Hilary Putnam\u2019s (1926-2016) \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\u201d,\nTyler Burge\u2019s \u201cIndividualism and the Mental\u201d, and Saul Kripke\u2019s Naming and Necessity. Putnam argues\nthat \u201ca better philosophy and a better science of language\u201d must encompass the \u201csocial dimension\nof cognition\u201d and the \u201ccontribution of the environment, other people, and the world\u201d to semantics\n(Putnam 1975, 49). Burge argues against any theory about the mind in which \u201cthe mental natures\nof all a person\u2019s or animal\u2019s mental states (and events) are such that there is no necessary or deep\nindividuative relation between the individual\u2019s being in states of those kinds and the nature of the\nindividual\u2019s physical or social environment\u201d (Burge 1986, 3-4).\nThe Twin Earth thought experiment of Putnam is the most famous argument in favor of externalism;\nit claims to show that two subjects can have identical internal psychological mental states but that\nthe content of these states can be different due to particular variations in the environment. Putnam\nasks us to imagine a world (Twin-Earth) in which water is not composed of H O like it is on our\n2\nworld but is rather composed of XYZ. When a person (call him Oscar) says \u201cwater\u201d on Earth the word\nrefers to H O, but when a different person (call him Twin-Oscar) says \u201cwater\u201d in a different place (on\n2\nTwin-Earth) the word refers to XYZ. This seems intuitively clear; the word \u201cwater\u201d refers to what the\nword is about in that particular environment (so when Oscar utters \u201cwater\u201d that word is about H O\n2\nin his environment). Putnam asks what would happen if Oscar is transported to Twin-Earth. Would\nthe word \u201cwater\u201d uttered by Oscar on Twin-Earth now refer to H O or XYZ? Notice that the thought\n2\nexperiment legislates that the only change that takes place when Oscar is transported from Earth to\nTwin-Earth is the change in his environment (i.e., all of his psychological states remain unchanged).\nNow, Putnam reasons that if knowing the meaning of a term is just a matter of being in a certain\npsychological state, then \u201cwater\u201d on Twin-Earth when uttered by Oscar should refer to H O and not\n2\nto XYZ as we might expect. This is because Oscar\u2019s psychological state was fixed on Earth, and if the\npsychological state fixes the reference then \u201cwater\u201d refers to H O regardless of the environment the\n2\nsubject is in (Putnam 1975).\n54 CONCEPTS&CONTENT Another way to put the matter is as follows: when Twin-Oscar on Twin-Earth says \u201cwater\u201d whilst\npointing to a lake that is entirely composed of XYZ, as all watery things are composed of on Twin-\nEarth, \u201cwater\u201d refers to XYZ and not to H O. But, Putnam\u2019s argument claims, if knowing the meaning\n2\nof a term is just a matter of being in a certain psychological state then \u201cwater\u201d uttered on Twin-Earth\nby Oscar transported from Earth cannot mean XYZ and must mean H O. Something seems to be\n2\nwrong here. If two people utter the same word in the same environment we expect that word to refer\nto the same thing. Thus, if we want to hold on to the claim that the meaning of a term determines its\nreference or extension then, the argument claims, we must concede that, as Putnam famously put it,\n\u201cCut the pie any way you like, \u2018meanings\u2019 just ain\u2019t in the head!\u201d (1975, 144) That is, the claim is that\nmind-internal properties on their own cannot fix the meanings of words or what their reference is.\nPutnam\u2019s argument is directed at the meanings of words, of course, but it was soon noticed by\nColin McGinn, Tyler Burge, and others that the same argument also applies to the contents of our\npropositional attitudes, hence to the contents of our thoughts. The main claim of externalism, then,\nis that even though thoughts are said to be inside a person\u2019s head, the content of these thoughts\n1\nsupervene on external factors in the environment of the person who has them. Thus, as Ben-\nMenahem remarks in regard to one of Putnam\u2019s examples, \u201cto speak of coffee tables it does not suffice\nfor us merely to have the concept of a coffee table, but we must be in contact with actual coffee tables\u201d\n(Ben-Menahem 2005, 10; emphasis in original).\nINTERNALIST SEMANTICS\nNow, it could be objected that externalism has to be right: How could content not depend on the\noutside world? Surely the meaning of the word \u201celephant\u201d cannot be due to only mind-internal\nproperties. The word is about elephants, it could be argued, which are in the mind-external world,\nnot inside the mind. As we will now see, internalists argue that there are good reasons to question the\nexternalist claim that concepts are connected to the world in the way in which externalists claim they\nare. In other words, internalism does not deny the link to the outside world but rather has a different\nexplanation of how our mind generates and interprets the content of our concepts. Internalism argues\nthat, for the purposes of scientific inquiry into language and mind, the internal properties of the\nhuman mind are the most relevant and fruitful subject matter. Thus construed, internalism is not so\nmuch a solution to the issues that externalists grapple with. Rather, as we will see below, internalism\nis a different research program, and so there is a difference in the sorts of questions externalism and\ninternalism attempt to answer.\nA succinct definition of internalism is provided by Wolfram Hinzen: \u201cInternalism is an explanatory\nstrategy that makes the internal structure and constitution of the organism a basis for the\ninvestigation of its external function and the ways in which it is embedded in an environment\u201d\n(Hinzen 2006, 139). Internalism studies the internal structure and mechanisms of an organism; the\nexternal environment comes into the picture when the internal processes are ascribed content by the\n1. Supervenience here refers to a certain set of properties in virtue of which some other set is made possible. If A supervenes on B then\nchanging anything in B would also change A. So, for example, the colour blue supervenes on a certain set of physical properties such\nthe wavelength of light. What follows is that if we change the wavelength of the light then we also change the colour. In regard to\ncontent, the externalist claim is that content supervenes on both what\u2019s in the head and on the environment. It follows, then, that if\nwe change the relevant features in the environment then the content would also change. Internalists, of course, reject this claim.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 55 theorist, thus explaining how the internal mechanisms constitute a cognitive process in a particular\nenvironment. Such content ascriptions, claim internalists, vary with the theorist\u2019s interests and aims,\nbut the content and its ascription are not an essential part of the theory itself. So, for example, the\nmechanism that detects vertical lines in the visual input will be in the scope of an internalist theory,\nbut not the representational content ascribed to the output of this mechanism. The latter could be\nany number of things (the vertical line could represent the edge of a building or be part of a larger\nrepresentation of a human face) but its underlying mechanism remains unchanged.\nIn other words, as discussed by Frances Egan in work spanning the last few decades, the internalist\nclaim is that the computational characterization of an internal mechanism abstracts away from\nspecific content ascriptions. So one can separate the content of, say, a visual state, from the\ncomputational machinery in virtue of which that content is made possible. For example, a particular\nmechanism may receive as input a certain set of parameters that require computation. The theorist\nthen examines the output of these computations. One can imagine a mechanism that is embedded in\nthe visual system being ascribed visual contents befitting the theory of vision. However, that same\nmechanism can be embedded in the auditory system and thus be ascribed different (auditory) contents\nthat are defined not in terms of visual properties but rather in terms of acoustical properties. In\nother words, there is nothing inherent to the internalist computations performed that makes them\nvisual or auditory. As Egan has discussed, there is an underlying set of computations that are required\nfor both visual and auditory processing. The label we give to the output of such computations (the\ncontent we ascribe to them) depends on where the input to the mechanism came from. If the input\nis visual then the theorist will ascribe the output of the mechanism a visual content. But nothing in\nthe internal mechanism itself tells us that. Internalism studies the internal mechanism itself, which\nremains unchanged regardless of whether it happens to be embedded or used by, say, the visual system\nor the auditory system.\nLet us unpack these claims. First, note that the externalist claim that states of individual organisms\ncannot be understood in complete isolation from the environment in which they happen to be is not\nin dispute. The argument is about whether what happens in the environment should be part of what\nthe theory is supposed to explain. So what is the problem that internalists see with the externalists\u2019\nrelation between words and the things words are used to talk about? In a classic paper that formed\none of the foundations of internalist semantics, Jerrold Katz (1932-2002) and Jerry Fodor (1935-2017)\ndiscussed this issue (though they did not frame it in terms of internalism versus externalism). Katz\nand Fodor ask the reader to compare the following three sentences:\n(1) \u201cShould we take junior back to the zoo?\u201d\n(2) \u201cShould we take the lion back to the zoo?\u201d\n(3) \u201cShould we take the bus back to the zoo?\u201d\nThey then remark that information that figures in the choice of the correct interpretation for each of\nthese sentences includes the fact that, say, lions, but not children and busses, are often kept in cages.\nThat is, unlike (2), the meaning of (1) cannot be that we should take a living being back to the zoo and\nput them in a cage. (1) means that we should take a child and show them the animals around the zoo.\n56 CONCEPTS&CONTENT (3), on the other hand, has neither of these interpretations. (3) cannot mean that we should take the\nbus to the zoo and put it in a cage, nor can it mean that we should take the bus and show it the animals\naround the zoo. In order to decipher these meanings one needs to know certain facts about the world;\nthese facts are not semantic or grammatical facts (Katz and Fodor 1963).\nAfter listing a handful of other examples of what information is needed for interpretation, Katz and\nFodor note that the reader will find it easy to construct an ambiguous sentence whose resolution\nrequires the prior representation of practically any relevant item of information about the world.\nThis is because, in order to resolve a great deal of ambiguous sentences, one needs to have certain\nfacts about the world without which certain interpretations of sentences are unavailable. For example,\nconsider the sentence \u201cI saw the man with the binoculars.\u201d If one didn\u2019t know what binoculars were,\nthen the only interpretation available would be that a person saw a man holding an object that is called\n\u201cbinoculars.\u201d However, once one\u2019s world knowledge is expanded to include facts about binoculars\n(namely, that they are used to see objects far away) then further interpretations become available and\nthen the sentence becomes ambiguous. That is, the sentence then has the additional interpretation\nthat \u201cI saw a man and I used binoculars to see that man.\u201d Katz and Fodor\u2019s claim is that in order to\ndisambiguate such sentences one needs to know things that are not purely semantic (what binoculars\nare used for is a fact about the world and not a grammatical fact). The problem is that a theory\nof meaning that aims to include all relevant information that is needed in order to disambiguate\nsentences and determine the correct interpretation will run into great difficulties, for such a theory\ncannot predict in advance what sort of information will be needed for sentence interpretation.\nThe upshot is that a theory that insists (as externalism does) on including the mind\u2019s relations to the\nexternal world in a theory of language cannot hope to find reliable relations of the sort described\nabove (let alone systematizing them into a fruitful explanatory theory). However, in regard to the\nunderlying mechanisms of the mind in virtue of which the generation and interpretation of content\nis made possible, internalists claim that a fruitful theory is possible. The most famous proponent\nof internalist semantics is Noam Chomsky, and his work stands in stark contrast to the externalist\nsemantics of Hilary Putnam or Donald Davidson (1917-2003). The recent work of Paul Pietroski\n(2008, 2010) is an excellent example of internalist semantics. Pietroski construes meaning in terms\nof blueprints that are used by the language faculty in the mind in order to construct concepts. This\nis an attempt to explain the underlying mental mechanisms in virtue of which we can generate and\ninterpret thought contents. The meaning of a word in internalist semantics is cashed out not in terms\nof the word\u2019s relation to the outside world but rather in terms of the word\u2019s internal role in the\nmind\u2019s construction of the concept that has the required content. Note the difference here. Internalist\nsemantics studies the mechanisms in the mind that build concepts. Once these concepts are generated\nthey are transferred from the language faculty to the mind-internal systems of thought and to the\n2\narticulatory-perceptual system. These systems then make use of concepts for various ends such as\nthinking and talking about the world.\nIn other words, the internalist claim is that the mind has certain mechanisms that include instructions\nto build concepts, which then provide the inputs to other (mind-internal) systems that enter into\n2. This is the system responsible for externalising language via sound or sign. The way a particular word is pronounced, for example,\nwill be determined by the articulatory-perceptual system, whereas the word\u2019s meaning will be determined by the systems of thought\n(sometimes known as the conceptual-intentional system).\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 57 various human actions, one of which is communication. Internalist semantics, then, concerns the\nnature of the computational mechanisms of the language faculty and their relation to the systems of\nthought; it concerns not the concepts themselves but the mechanisms that fetch, build, and combine\nconcepts within the mind. That is, internalism is concerned with the mind-internal mechanisms\nof concept creation. This is of course one step removed from what externalist semantics studies,\nwhich are the concepts themselves, their role in language use, and their relation to the speaker\u2019s\nenvironment.\nCONCLUSION\nThe difference between the externalist and internalist position in regard to mental content is a\ndifference in the sort of questions that each attempts to answer. It is a difference in the way in which\neach construes the role that content plays in the explanation of language and mind. The argument\nin favor of either approach to the science and philosophy of language and mind is of course not a\nknockdown argument, nor is it a guarantee that one side will turn out to be the correct path. As\nGabriel Segal correctly remarks, \u201cThe point is that we should not expect to discover too much from\nthe armchair. Discovering the true nature of content should be a scientific enterprise (whether we also\ncall it \u2018philosophical\u2019 or not)\u201d (Segal 2000, 20).\nREFERENCES\nBen-Menahem, Yemima, ed. 2005.

Suppose it is the night\nbefore an exam, and Quinn should be studying, but her roommate asks her to come out with her\nand some friends. It certainly seems like it is up to Quinn what she does. She could stay home and\nstudy or she could spend the night out with friends. The choice seems hers to make and up to her.\nAnd when Quinn arrives exhausted to her exam the following morning, Quinn should feel justified\nblaming herself for failing to do what she should have done and what she could have done.\nOr, suppose you are weighing the pros and cons between a career in something with a reasonable\nreturn on investment, like nursing or accounting, versus a career in a field with more questionable\ncareer prospects, like philosophy. Again, the choice seems yours to make. You\u2019re free to pursue\nwhatever career path you want and it is ultimately up to you what you decide to do with your life.\nRight?\nBut maybe this sense of freedom is a mere illusion. Maybe Quinn\u2019s decision to go out with her friends\nthe night before a big exam is an inevitable, deterministic consequence of the past and the laws of\nnature in such a way that her supposed freedom is undermined. Or perhaps it is the case that the\nreal reason someone chooses a career in philosophy over a career in accounting has more to do with\nunconscious brain processes and the environment and social situation they find themselves in then\nit has to do with any conscious decision they may have made. And if so, if our choices are really the\ncausal results of unconscious brain processes or external environmental factors, are any of us really\nfree? Are we really in control of who we are and what we do? Or are free-will skeptics correct to claim\nthat the things we do and the way that we are is ultimately the consequent of external factors beyond\nour control?\nTo investigate whether or not humans sometimes act freely, we need to first clarify what is meant\nby free will. The discussion of freedom has a long history and free will has been used to apply to a\nmultitude of, often radically different, abilities and capacities that people may, or may not, have.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 61 A helpful place to start is to note that most philosophers today who write on free will have in mind\nthe kind of control required for morally responsible action (McKenna and Pereboom 2016, 6-7). That\nis, to ask whether or not someone is free is to ask whether or not they have control over their actions\nsuch that they are deserving of blame or praise for what they do (or fail to do).\nDETERMINISM AND FREEDOM\nDeterminism and free will are often thought to be in deep conflict. Whether or not this is true has a\nlot to do with what is meant by determinism and an account of what free will requires.\nFirst of all, determinism is not the view that free actions are impossible. Rather, determinism is\nthe view that at any one time, only one future is physically possible. To be a little more specific,\ndeterminism is the view that a complete description of the past along with a complete account of the\n1\nrelevant laws of nature logically entails all future events.\nIndeterminism is simply the denial of determinism. If determinism is incompatible with free will, it\nwill be because free actions are only possible in worlds in which more than one future is physically\npossible at any one moment in time. While it might be true that free will requires indeterminism, it\u2019s\nnot true merely by definition. A further argument is needed and this suggests that it is at least possible\nthat people could sometimes exercise the control necessary for morally responsible action, even if we\nlive in a deterministic world.\nIt is worth saying something about fatalism before we move on. It is really easy to mistake\ndeterminism for fatalism, and fatalism does seem to be in straightforward conflict with free will.\nFatalism is the view that we are powerless to do anything other than what we actually do. If fatalism is\ntrue, then nothing that we try or think or intend or believe or decide has any causal effect or relevance\nas to what we actually end up doing.\nBut note that determinism need not entail fatalism. Determinism is a claim about what is logically\nentailed by the rules/laws governing a world and the past of said world. It is not the claim that we lack\nthe power to do other than what we actually were already going to do. Nor is it the view that we fail\nto be an important part of the causal story for why we do what we do. And this distinction may allow\nsome room for freedom, even in deterministic worlds.\nAn example will be helpful here. We know that the boiling point for water is 100\u00b0C. Suppose we know\nin both a deterministic world and a fatalistic world that my pot of water will be boiling at 11:22am\ntoday. Determinism makes the claim that if I take a pot of water and I put it on my stove, and heat\nit to 100\u00b0C, it will boil. This is because the laws of nature (in this case, water that is heated to 100\u00b0C\nwill boil) and the events of the past (I put a pot of water on a hot stove) bring about the boiling\nwater. But fatalism makes a different claim. If my pot of water is fated to boil at 11:22am today, then\nno matter what I or anyone does, my pot of water will boil at exactly 11:22am today. I could try to\nempty the pot of water out at 11:21. I could try to take the pot as far away from a heating source as\npossible. Nonetheless, my pot of water will be boiling at 11:22 precisely because it was fated that this\n1. I have hidden some complexity here. I have defined determinism in terms of logical entailment. Sometimes people talk about\ndeterminism as a causal relationship. For our purposes, this distinction is not relevant, and if it is easier for you to make sense of\ndeterminism by thinking of the past and the laws of nature causing all future events, that is perfectly acceptable to do.\n62 FREEDOMOFTHEWILL would happen. Under fatalism, the future is fixed or preordained, but this need not be the case in a\ndeterministic world. Under determinism, the future is a certain way because of the past and the rules\ngoverning said world. If we know that a pot of water will boil at 11:22am in a deterministic world, it\u2019s\nbecause we know that the various causal conditions will hold in our world such that at 11:22 my pot\nof water will have been put on a heat source and brought to 100\u00b0C. Our deliberations, our choices,\nand our free actions may very well be part of the process that brings a pot of water to the boiling point\nin a deterministic world, whereas these are clearly irrelevant in fatalistic ones.\nTHREE VIEWS OF FREEDOM\nMost accounts of freedom fall into one of three camps. Some people take freedom to require merely\nthe ability to \u201cdo what you want to do.\u201d For example, if you wanted to walk across the room, right\nnow, and you also had the ability, right now, to walk across the room, you would be free as you could\ndo exactly what you want to do. We will call this easy freedom.\nOthers view freedom on the infamous \u201cGarden of Forking Paths\u201d model. For these people, free action\nrequires more than merely the ability to do what you want to do. It also requires that you have the\nability to do otherwise than what you actually did. So, If Anya is free when she decides to take a\nsip from her coffee, on this view, it must be the case that Anya could have refrained from sipping\nher coffee. The key to freedom, then, is alternative possibilities and we will call this the alternative\npossibilities view of free action.\nFinally, some people envision freedom as requiring, not alternative possibilities but the right kind of\nrelationship between the antecedent sources of our actions and the actions that we actually perform.\nSometimes this view is explained by saying that the free agent is the source, perhaps even the ultimate\nsource of her action. We will call this kind of view a source view of freedom.\nNow, the key question we want to focus on is whether or not any of these three models of freedom\nare compatible with determinism. It could turn out that all three kinds of freedom are ruled out by\ndeterminism, so that the only way freedom is possible is if determinism is false. If you believe that\ndeterminism rules out free action, you endorse a view called incompatibilism. But it could turn out\nthat one or all three of these models of freedom are compatible with determinism. If you believe that\nfree action is compatible with determinism, you are a compatibilist.\nLet us consider compatibilist views of freedom and two of the most formidable challenges that\ncompatibilists face: the consequence argument and the ultimacy argument.\nBegin with easy freedom. Is easy freedom compatible with determinism? A group of philosophers\n2\ncalled classic compatibilists certainly thought so. They argued that free will requires merely the\nability for an agent to act without external hindrance. Suppose, right now, you want to put your\ntextbook down and grab a cup of coffee. Even if determinism is true, you probably, right now, can do\nexactly that. You can put your textbook down, walk to the nearest Starbucks, and buy an overpriced\ncup of coffee. Nothing is stopping you from doing what you want to do. Determinism does not seem\n2. Two of the more well-known classic compatibilists include Thomas Hobbes and David Hume. See: Hobbes, Thomas, (1651) 1994,\nLeviathan, ed. Edwin Curley, Canada: Hackett Publishing Company; and Hume, David, (1739) 1978, A Treatise of Human Nature,\nOxford: Oxford University Press.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 63 to be posing any threat to your ability to do what you want to do right now. If you want to stop reading\nand grab a coffee, you can. But, by contrast, if someone had chained you to the chair you are sitting in,\nthings would be a bit different. Even if you wanted to grab a cup of coffee, you would not be able to.\nYou would lack the ability to do so. You would not be free to do what you want to do. This has nothing\nto do with determinism, of course. It is not the fact that you might be living in a deterministic world\nthat is threatening your free will. It is that an external hindrance (the chains holding you to your chair)\nis stopping from you doing what you want to do. So, if what we mean by freedom is easy freedom, it\nlooks like freedom really is compatible with determinism.\nEasy freedom has run into some rather compelling opposition, and most philosophers today agree\nthat a plausible account of easy freedom is not likely. But, by far, the most compelling challenge the\n3\nview faces can be seen in the consequence argument. The consequence argument is as follows:\n1. If determinism is true, then all human actions are consequences of past events and the laws\nof nature.\n2. No human can do other than they actually do except by changing the laws of nature or\nchanging the past.\n3. No human can change the laws of nature or the past.\n4. If determinism is true, no human has free will.\nThis is a powerful argument. It is very difficult to see where this argument goes wrong, if it goes\nwrong. The first premise is merely a restatement of determinism. The second premise ties the ability\nto do otherwise to the ability to change the past or the laws of nature, and the third premise points\nout the very reasonable assumption that humans are unable to modify the laws of nature or the past.\nThis argument effectively devastates easy freedom by proposing that we never act without external\nhindrances precisely because our actions are caused by past events and the laws of nature in such a\nway that we not able to contribute anything to the causal production of our actions. This argument\nalso seems to pose a deeper problem for freedom in deterministic worlds. If this argument works, it\nestablishes that, given determinism, we are powerless to do otherwise, and to the extent that freedom\nrequires the ability to do otherwise, this argument seems to rule out free action. Note that if this\nargument works, it poses a challenge for both the easy and alternative possibilities view of free will.\nHow might someone respond to this argument? First, suppose you adopt an alternative possibilities\nview of freedom and believe that the ability to do otherwise is what is needed for genuine free\nwill. What you would need to show is that alternative possibilities, properly understood, are not\nincompatible with determinism. Perhaps you might argue that if we understand the ability to do\n3. For an earlier version of this argument see: Ginet, Carl, 1966, \u201cMight We Have No Choice?\u201d in Freedom and Determinism, ed. Keith\nLehrer, 87-104, Random House.\n64 FREEDOMOFTHEWILL otherwise properly we will see that we actually do have the ability to change the laws of nature or the\npast.\nThat might sound counterintuitive. How could it possibly be the case that a mere mortal could change\nthe laws of nature or the past? Think back to Quinn\u2019s decision to spend the night before her exam out\nwith friends instead of studying. When she shows up to her exam exhausted, and she starts blaming\nherself, she might say, \u201cWhy did I go out? That was dumb! I could have stayed home and studied.\u201d\nAnd she is sort of right that she could have stayed home. She had the general ability to stay home and\nstudy. It is just that if she had stayed home and studied the past would be slightly different or the laws\nof nature would be slightly different. What this points to is that there might be a way of cashing out\nthe ability to do otherwise that is compatible with determinism and does allow for an agent to kind of\n4\nchange the past or even the laws of nature.\nBut suppose we grant that the consequence argument demonstrates that determinism really does\nrule out alternative possibilities. Does that mean we must abandon the alternative possibilities view\nof freedom? Well, not necessarily. You could instead argue that free will is possible, provided\n5\ndeterminism is false. That is a big if, of course, but maybe determinism will turn out to be false.\nWhat if determinism turns out to be true? Should we give up, then, and concede that there is no free\nwill? Well, that might be too quick. A second response to the consequence argument is available. All\nyou need to do is deny that freedom requires the ability to do otherwise.\nIn 1969, Harry Frankfurt proposed an influential thought experiment that demonstrated that free\nwill might not require alternative possibilities at all (Frankfurt [1969] 1988). If he\u2019s right about this,\nthen the consequence argument, while compelling, does not demonstrate that no one lacks free will in\ndeterministic worlds, because free will does not require the ability to do otherwise. It merely requires\nthat agents be the source of their actions in the right kind of way. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves.\nHere is a simplified paraphrase of Frankfurt\u2019s case:\nBlack wants Jones to perform a certain action. Black is prepared to go to considerable lengths to get his way,\nbut he prefers to avoid unnecessary work. So he waits until Jones is about to make up his mind what to do,\nand he does nothing unless it is clear to him (Black is an excellent judge of such things) that Jones is going\nto decide not to do what Black wants him to do. If it does become clear that Jones is going to decide to do\nsomething other than what Black wanted him to do, Black will intervene, and ensure that Jones decides to do,\nand does do, exactly what Black wanted him to do. Whatever Jones\u2019 initial preferences and inclinations, then,\nBlack will have his way. As it turns out, Jones decides, on his own, to do the action that Black wanted him to\nperform. So, even though Black was entirely prepared to intervene, and could have intervened, to guarantee\nthat Jones would perform the action, Black never actually has to intervene because Jones decided, for reasons\nof his own, to perform the exact action that Black wanted him to perform. (Frankfurt [1969] 1988, 6-7)\nNow, what is going on here? Jones is overdetermined to perform a specific act. No matter what\n4. For two notable attempts to respond to the consequence argument by claiming that humans can change the past or the laws of\nnature see: Fischer, John Martin, 1994, The Metaphysics of Free Will, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers; and Lewis, David, 1981, \u201cAre We\nFree to Break the Laws?\u201d Theoria 47: 113-21.\n5. Many philosophers try to develop views of freedom on the assumption that determinism is incompatible with free action. The view\nthat freedom is possible, provided determinism is false is called Libertarianism. For more on Libertarian views of freedom, see:\nClarke, Randolph and Justin Capes, 2017, \u201cIncompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will,\u201d Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 65 happens, no matter what Jones initially decides or wants to do, he is going to perform the action\nBlack wants him to perform. He absolutely cannot do otherwise. But note that there seems to be a\ncrucial difference between the case in which Jones decides on his own and for his own reasons to\nperform the action Black wanted him to perform and the case in which Jones would have refrained\nfrom performing the action were it not for Black intervening to force him to perform the action. In\nthe first case, Jones is the source of his action. It the thing he decided to do and he does it for his\nown reasons. But in the second case, Jones is not the source of his actions. Black is. This distinction,\nthought Frankfurt, should be at the heart of discussions of free will and moral responsibility. The\ncontrol required for moral responsibility is not the ability to do otherwise (Frankfurt [1969] 1988,\n9-10).\nIf alternative possibilities are not what free will requires, what kind of control is needed for free\naction? Here we have the third view of freedom we started with: free will as the ability to be the source\nof your actions in the right kind of way. Source compatibilists argue that this ability is not threatened\nby determinism, and building off of Frankfurt\u2019s insight, have gone on to develop nuanced, often\n6\nradically divergent source accounts of freedom. Should we conclude, then, that provided freedom\n7\ndoes not require alternative possibilities that it is compatible with determinism? Again, that would be\ntoo quick. Source compatibilists have reason to be particularly worried about an argument developed\nby Galen Strawson called the ultimacy argument (Strawson [1994] 2003, 212-228).\nRather than trying to establish that determinism rules out alternative possibilities, Strawson tried to\nshow that determinism rules out the possibility of being the ultimate source of your actions. While\nthis is a problem for anyone who tries to establish that free will is compatible with determinism, it\nis particularly worrying for source compatibilists as they\u2019ve tied freedom to an agent\u2019s ability to be\nsource of its actions. Here is the argument:\n1. A person acts of her own free will only if she is the act\u2019s ultimate source.\n2. If determinism is true, no one is the ultimate source of her actions.\n3. Therefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free will. (McKenna and\n8\nPereboom 2016, 148)\n6. For elaboration on recent compatibilist views of freedom, see McKenna, Michael and D. Justin Coates, 2015, \u201cCompatibilism,\u201d\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/.\n7. You might be unimpressed by the way source compatibilists understand the ability to be the source of your actions. For example,\nyou might that what it means to be the source of your actions is to be the ultimate cause of your actions. Or maybe you think that to\ngenuinely be the source of your actions you need to be the agent-cause of your actions. Those are both reasonable positions to\nadopt. Typically, people who understand free will as requiring either of these abilities believe that free will is incompatible with\ndeterminism. That said, there are many Libertarian views of free will that try to develop a plausible account of agent causation.\nThese views are called Agent-Causal Libertarianism. See: Clarke, Randolph and Justin Capes, 2017, \u201cIncompatibilist\n(Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will,\u201d Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-\ntheories/.\n66 FREEDOMOFTHEWILL This argument requires some unpacking. First of all, Strawson argues that for any given situation, we\ndo what we do because of the way we are ([1994] 2003, 219). When Quinn decides to go out with her\nfriends rather than study, she does so because of the way she is. She prioritizes a night with her friends\nover studying, at least on that fateful night before her exam. If Quinn had stayed in and studied, it\nwould be because she was slightly different, at least that night. She would be such that she prioritized\nstudying for her exam over a night out. But this applies to any decision we make in our lives. We\ndecide to do what we do because of how we already are.\nBut if what we do is because of the way we are, then in order to be responsible for our actions, we\nneed to be the source of how we are, at least in the relevant mental respects (Strawson [1994] 2003,\n219). There is the first premise. But here comes the rub: the way we are is a product of factors beyond\nour control such as the past and the laws of nature ([1994] 2003, 219; 222-223). The fact that Quinn is\nsuch that she prioritizes a night with friends over studying is due to her past and the relevant laws of\nnature. It is not up to her that she is the way she is. It is ultimately factors extending well beyond her,\npossibly all the way back to the initial conditions of the universe that account for why she is the way\nshe is that night. And to the extent that this is compelling, the ultimate source of Quinn\u2019s decision to\ngo out is not her. Rather, it is some condition of the universe external to her. And therefore, Quinn is\nnot free.\nOnce again, this is a difficult argument to respond to. You might note that \u201cultimate source\u201d is\nambiguous and needing further clarification. Some compatibilists have pointed this out and argued\nthat once we start developing careful accounts of what it means to be the source of our actions, we\nwill see that the relevant notion of source-hood is compatible with determinism.\nFor example, while it may be true that no one is the ultimate cause of their actions in deterministic\nworlds precisely because the ultimate source of all actions will extend back to the initial conditions\nof the universe, we can still be a mediated source of our actions in the sense required for moral\nresponsibility. Provided the actual source of our action involves a sophisticated enough set of\ncapacities for it to make sense to view us as the source of our actions, we could still be the source of\nour actions, in the relevant sense (McKenna and Pereboom 2016, 154). After all, even if determinism\nis true, we still act for reasons. We still contemplate what to do and weigh reasons for and against\nvarious actions, and we still are concerned with whether or not the actions we are considering reflect\nour desires, our goals, our projects, and our plans. And you might think that if our actions stem from\na history that includes us bringing all the features of our agency to bear upon the decision that is the\nproximal cause of our action, that this causal history is one in which we are the source of our actions\nin the way that is really relevant to identifying whether or not we are acting freely.\nOthers have noted that even if it is true that Quinn is not directly free in regard to the beliefs and\ndesires that suggest she should go out with her friends rather than study (they are the product of\nfactors beyond her control such as her upbringing, her environment, her genetics, or maybe even\n8. As with most philosophical arguments, the ultimacy argument has been formulated in a number of different ways. In Galen\nStrawson\u2019s original paper he gives three different versions of the argument, one of which has eight premises and one that has ten\npremises. A full treatment of either of those versions of this argument would require more time and space than we have available\nhere. I have chosen to use the McKenna/Pereboom formulation of the argument due its simplicity and their clear presentation of the\ncentral issues raised by the argument.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 67 random luck), this need not imply that she lacks control as to whether or not she chooses to act upon\n9\nthem. Perhaps it is the case that even though how we are may be due to factors beyond our control,\nnonetheless, we are still the source of what we do because it is still, even under determinism, up to us\nas to whether we choose to exercise control over our conduct.\nFREE WILL AND THE SCIENCES\nMany challenges to free will come, not from philosophy, but from the sciences. There are two main\nscientific arguments against free will, one coming from neuroscience and one coming from the social\nsciences. The concern coming from research in the neurosciences is that some empirical results\nsuggest that all our choices are the result of unconscious brain processes, and to the extent choices\nmust be consciously made to be free choices, it seems that we never make a conscious free choice.\nThe classic studies motivating a picture of human action in which unconscious brain processes are\ndoing the bulk of the causal work for action were conducted by Benjamin Libet. Libet\u2019s experiments\ninvolved subjects being asked to flex their wrists whenever they felt the urge to do so. Subjects were\nasked to note the location of a clock hand on a modified clock when they became aware of the urge to\nact. While doing this their brain activity was being scanned using EEG technology. What Libet noted\nis that around 550 milliseconds before a subject acted, a readiness potential (increased brain activity)\nwould be measured by the EEG technology. But subjects were reporting awareness of an urge to flex\ntheir wrist around 200 milliseconds before they acted (Libet 1985).\nThis painted a strange picture of human action. If conscious intentions were the cause of our actions,\nyou may expect to see a causal story in which the conscious awareness of an urge to flex your wrist\nshows up first, then a ramping up of brain activity, and finally an action. But Libet\u2019s studies showed\na causal story in which an action starts with unconscious brain activity, the subject later becomes\nconsciously aware that they are about to act, and then the action happens. The conscious awareness\nof action seemed to be a byproduct of the actual unconscious process that was causing the action. It\nwas not the cause of the action itself. And this result suggests that unconscious brain processes, not\nconscious ones, are the real causes of our actions. To the extent that free action requires our conscious\ndecisions to be the initiating causes of our actions, it looks like we may never act freely.\nWhile this research is intriguing, it probably does not establish that we are not free. Alfred Mele is\na philosopher who has been heavily critical of these studies. He raises three main objections to the\nconclusions drawn from these arguments.\nFirst, Mele points out that self-reports are notoriously unreliable (2009, 60-64). Conscious perception\ntakes time, and we are talking about milliseconds. The actual location of the clock hand is probably\nmuch closer to 550 milliseconds when the agent \u201cintends\u201d or has the \u201curge\u201d to act than it is to 200\nmilliseconds. So, there\u2019s some concerns about experimental design here.\nSecond, an assumption behind these experiments is that what is going on at 550 milliseconds is that\na decision is being made to flex the wrist (Mele 2014, 11). We might challenge this assumption. Libet\n9. For two attempts to respond to the ultimacy argument in this way, see: Mele, Alfred, 1995, Autonomous Agents, New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press; and McKenna, Michael, 2008, \u201cUltimacy & Sweet Jane\u201d in Nick Trakakis and Daniel Cohen, eds, Essays on Free Will\nand Moral Responsibility, Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing: 186-208.\n68 FREEDOMOFTHEWILL ran some variants of his experiment in which he asked subjects to prepare to flex their wrist but to\nstop themselves from doing so. So, basically, subjects simply sat there in the chair and did nothing.\nLibet interpreted the results of these experiments as showing that we might not have a free will,\nbut we certainly have a \u201cfree won\u2019t\u201d because we seem capable of consciously vetoing or stopping an\naction, even if that action might be initiated by unconscious processes (2014, 12-13). Mele points out\nthat what might be going on in these scenarios is that the real intention to act or not act is what\nhappens consciously at 200 milliseconds, and if so, there is little reason to think these experiments are\ndemonstrating that we lack free will (2014, 13).\nFinally, Mele notes that while it may be the case that some of our decisions and actions look like the\nwrist-flicking actions Libet was studying, it is doubtful that all or even most of our decisions are like\nthis (2014, 15). When we think about free will, we rarely think of actions like wrist-flicking. Free\nactions are typically much more complex and they are often the kind of thing where the decision to do\nsomething extends across time. For example, your decision about what to major in at college or even\nwhere to study was probably made over a period of months, even years. And that decision probably\ninvolved periods of both conscious and unconscious cognition. Why think that a free choice cannot\ninvolve some components that are unconscious?\nA separate line of attack on free will comes from the situationist literature in the social sciences\n(particularly social psychology). There is a growing body of research suggesting that situational and\nenvironmental factors profoundly influence human behavior, perhaps in ways that undermine free\nwill (Mele 2014, 72).\nMany of the experiments in the situationist literature are among the most vivid and disturbing in all\nof social psychology. Stanley Milgram, for example, conducted a series of experiments on obedience\nin which ordinary people were asked to administer potentially lethal voltages of electricity to an\n10\ninnocent subject in order to advance scientific research, and the vast majority of people did so!\nAnd in Milgram\u2019s experiments, what affected whether or not subjects were willing to administer\nthe shocks were minor, seemingly insignificant environmental factors such as whether the person\nrunning the experiment looked professional or not (Milgram 1963).\nWhat experiments like Milgram\u2019s obedience experiments might show is that it is our situations, our\nenvironments that are the real causes of our actions, not our conscious, reflective choices. And this\nmay pose a threat to free will. Should we take this kind of research as threatening freedom?\nMany philosophers would resist concluding that free will does not exist on the basis of these kinds\nof experiments. Typically, not everyone who takes part in situationist studies is unable to resist the\nsituational influences they are subject to. And it appears to be the case that when we are aware of\nsituational influences, we are more likely to resist them. Perhaps the right way to think about this\nresearch is that there all sorts of situations that can influence us in ways that we may not consciously\nendorse, but that nonetheless, we are still capable of avoiding these effects when we are actively trying\nto do so. For example, the brain sciences have made many of us vividly aware of a whole host of\ncognitive biases and situational influences that humans are typically subject to and yet, when we are\naware of these influences, we are less susceptible to them. The more modest conclusion to draw here\n10. Fortunately, no real shocks were administered. The subjects merely believed they were doing so.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 69 is not that we lack free will, but that exercising control over our actions is much more difficult than\nmany of us believe it to be. We are certainly influenced by the world we are a part of, but to be\ninfluenced by the world is different from being determined by it, and this may allow us to, at least\nsometimes, exercise some control over the actions we perform.\nNo one knows yet whether or not humans sometimes exercise the control over their actions required\nfor moral responsibility. And so I leave it to you, dear reader: Are you free?\nREFERENCES\nFrankfurt, Harry.

Critical to the success of this approach is including mechanisms\nto ensure that open textbooks produced with the Community are high quality, and meet the needs of\nall students who will one day use them. Rebus books undergo both peer review from faculty subject\nmatter experts and beta testing in classrooms, where student and instructor feedback is collected.\nThis book has been peer reviewed by a subject expert from a higher education institution. The full-\ntext received an open review from the reviewer, based on their area of expertise. The reviewer was\nan academic with specialist knowledge in Philosophy of Mind.\nThe review was structured around considerations of the intended audience of the book, and examined\nthe comprehensiveness, accuracy, and relevance of content, as well as longevity and cultural\nrelevance. Further review by the series editor and the copy editor focused on clarity, consistency,\norganization structure flow, and grammatical errors. See the review guide for more details. Changes\nsuggested by the reviewer were incorporated by chapter authors and the book editor.\nHeather Salazar (book editor), Christina Hendricks (series editor) and authors Eran Asoulin, Paul\nRichard Blum, Tony Cheng, Daniel Haas, Jason Newman, Henry Shevlin, Elly Vintiadis, and the team\nat Rebus would like to thank the reviewer for the time, care, and commitment they contributed to the\nproject. We recognise that peer reviewing is a generous act of service on their part. This book would\nnot be the robust, valuable resource that it is were it not for their feedback and input.\nPeer reviewer: Adriano Palma, the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.\n80 PHILOSOPHYOFMIND ACCESSIBILITY ASSESSMENT\nA NOTE FROM THE REBUS COMMUNITY\nWe are working to create a new, collaborative model for publishing open textbooks. Critical to our\nsuccess in reaching this goal is to ensure that all books produced using that model meet the needs of\nall students who will one day use them. To us, open means inclusive, so for a book to be open, it must\nalso be accessible.\nAs a result, we are working with accessibility experts and others in the OER community to develop\nbest practices for creating accessible open textbooks, and are building those practices into the Rebus\nmodel of publishing. By doing this, we hope to ensure that all books produced using the Rebus\nCommunity are accessible by default, and require an absolute minimum of remediation or adaptation\nto meet any individual student\u2019s needs.\nWhile we work on developing guidelines and implementing support for authoring accessible content,\nwe are making a good faith effort to ensure that books produced with our support meet accessibility\nstandards wherever possible, and to highlight areas where we know there is work to do. It is our hope\nthat by being transparent on our current books, we can begin the process of making sure accessibility\nis top of mind for all authors, adopters, students and contributors of all kinds on all our open textbook\nprojects.\nBelow is a short assessment of eight key areas that have been assessed during the production process.\nThe checklist has been drawn from the BCcampus Open Education Accessibility Toolkit. While a\nchecklist such as this is just one part of a holistic approach to accessibility, it is one way to begin our\nwork on embedded good accessibility practices in the books we support.\nWherever possible, we have identified ways in which anyone may contribute their expertise to\nimprove the accessibility of this text.\nWe also welcome any feedback from students, instructors or others who encounter the book and\nidentify an issue that needs resolving. This book is an ongoing project and will be updated as needed.\nIf you would like to submit a correction or suggestion, please do so using the Introduction to\nPhilosophy series accessibility suggestions form.\nPHILOSOPHYOFMIND 81 ACCESSIBILITY CHECKLIST\nAccessibility Checklist\nCategory Item Status\nOrganizing\nContent is organized under headings and subheadings Yes\nContent\nOrganizing Headings and subheadings are used sequentially (e.g. Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) as well as logically (if the\nYes\nContent title is Heading 1 then there should be no other Heading 1 styles as the title is the uppermost level)\nImages that convey information include Alternative Text (alt-text) descriptions of the image\u2019s content or\nImages Yes\nfunction\nImages Graphs, charts, and maps also include contextual or supporting details in the text surrounding the image N/A\nImages Images do not rely on colour to convey information Yes\nImages that are purely decorative contain empty alternative text descriptions.
