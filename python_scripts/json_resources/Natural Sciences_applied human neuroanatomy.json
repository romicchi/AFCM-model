We\nwould like to argue an alternative proposition; that the neurologic examination is a\nreasonable and logical exercise involving the clinical application of basic principles of\nneuroanatomy and neurophysiology. One of our goals in developing this manual is to\nconvince the reader of the truth of this perspective.\nMichael F. Nolan, Ph.D., P.T.\nJohn P. McNamara, M.S., D.C.\nvi  Introduction\nThis manual is comprised of two types of learning activities: free response fill-in-the-\nblank questions focused of the facts and principles of neuroanatomy and\nneurophysiology that underpin the neurologic examination and specifically developed\nexercises that demonstrate how the facts and principles are related to the particular\ntests and procedures that comprise the neurologic examination. Free response\nquestions form the bulk of the Neuroscience Review section of each chapter and are\nintended as a review of information previously or concurrently being learned regarding\nthe structure, function and organization of the nervous system. Some questions focus\non anatomical or physiological facts and relationships that help explain why certain\ntechniques are performed as they are, such as why non-nociceptive tactile stimuli are\nrequired in order to activate nerve impulse transmission in the lemniscal system. Other\nquestions are intended to revisit facts and concepts that are needed to properly interpret\nthe elicited findings.\nThe Application Exercises of each chapter are designed to demonstrate how\nneuroanatomical and neurophysiological information is used in the design of particular\nclinical tests of neurologic function. The application exercises are also intended to help\nusers learn how to perform and become comfortable with the various clinical maneuvers\nand tests that comprise the routine neurologic examination. An important outcome of\nperforming these exercises is that, as a member of a learning group, each individual\nhas the opportunity to experience the neurologic examination from the point of view of\nthe subject (patient) \u2013 an experience that arguably provides insight and understanding\nthat can be gained in no other way.\nThe questions and exercises in the manual are designed as group learning\nexercises that might complement and reinforce learning acquired in more traditionally\nstructured courses dealing with the clinical examination of a patient. The \u201cgroup activity\u201d\napproach, in which the student performs each exercise on a small number of \u201cnormal\u201d\nsubjects (classmates), is founded on the belief that the ability to recognize an abnormal\nfinding on clinical examination requires a familiarity with the range of normal findings in\nthe otherwise healthy population. This is particularly true for new learners who may be\nfor the first time, learning about the structure and function of the nervous system.\nIt is our hope that the questions and exercises in this manual will help the reader\nacquire and solidify both knowledge and skill in evaluating the function of the nervous\nsystem.\n1 How to Use the Manual\nThe exercises described in this manual are group activities, intended and designed for\nsmall numbers of students working together. Each work group should ideally consist of\nfour to six students, preferably mixed with regard to gender, race, ethnicity, body size\nand overall shape. The intent of building diversity within the work group is to permit\nstudents to gain familiarity with as wide a range of normal findings as class enrollment\nwill permit. Students should dress comfortably in clothing that does not prohibit the\nproper performance of the exercises described.\nEach student in the work group should perform each exercise on all members of\nthe group and take a turn as subject for each of the other members of the group. In this\nway students can begin the process of gaining familiarity with the range of normal for a\nparticular examination technique and begin to recognize differences among individuals\nthat may affect how the test is performed or how the results are interpreted. In addition,\nstudents can begin to gain an appreciation of what it may be like to be the patient in a\nclinical encounter. Clearly, the greatest benefit is achieved when each student performs\neach exercise on all of the members of his or her group.\nAlthough these exercises are intended to be performed during regularly\nscheduled laboratory sessions when faculty or preceptor assistance may be available,\nthere is no reason why they cannot be performed or repeated outside scheduled class\ntime. Both technical skill and the ability to reliably interpret exam results are best\ndeveloped by practice and conscious reflection. There are simply no substitutes for\ndirect experience and practice.\nIt is essential that you come to each scheduled laboratory session with all the\ndiagnostic tools and other supplies that may be necessary to complete the exercises.\nBriefly review the exercises before each session so that you know what to bring in order\nto benefit from the exercises. Please be conscientious in this regard.\nFinally, learning by application, particularly when it involves human subjects, can\nsometimes be uncomfortable or embarrassing for both the learner and the subjects,\nwhether they are classmates or actual patients. Please view these exercises as\nimportant, necessary and serious parts of your educational and professional\ndevelopment, and treat your workgroup partners with the respect and sensitivity you\nwould wish them to extend to you.\n2 Anterolateral System\nObjectives\n1.
