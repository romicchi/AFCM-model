{"text":"26. FOIL AND MORE\nextending the\ndistributive law In this section, the distributive law is extended to cover situations like these:\na(b+c+ d) = ab+ac +ad\n(a +b)(c +d) = ac+ad +bc +bd\n(a +b+ c)(d +e+ f) = ad+ae +af +bd +be +bf +cd +ce +cf\nAlong the way, an important memory device called FOIL ( FirstOuter Inner\nLast) is presented.\nFirst, some new terminology is needed:\nterms;\nidentifying terms In an addition problem (a\nsum), the things being added are called the terms.\nFor example, in the addition problem 2 + 3x + 5y, the terms are 2 , 3 x, and 5y .\na term\nincludes its sign If subtraction is involved, rewrite the expression (at least mentally) as an addi-\ntion problem before identifying the terms. Here's an example: to \fnd the terms\nin the expression 1\n\u00002t + 3xy \u00005x 2\n, \frst rewrite as follows:\n1 \u0000 2t + 3xy \u00005x 2\n= 1 + (\u00002t) + 3xy + (\u00005x2\n)\nThe terms are 1 , \u00002t, 3xy , and \u00005x2\n. Notice that a minus sign becomes\n` part of ' a term. The phrase used to describe this situation is that a term\nincludes its sign .\nnumerical\ncoe\u000ecient;\ncoe\u000ecient In a term like 2\nx, there are two parts that are usually of interest: the numerical\npart (2) and the variable part (x) . The numerical part is given a special name|\nit is called the numerical coe\u000ecient or, more simply, thecoe\u000ecientof the term.\nIn the term 4xy , the coe\u000ecient is 4 and the variable part is xy.\nIn the term \u00007x2\ny 3\n, the coe\u000ecient is \u00007 and the variable part is x2\ny 3\n.\nWhat if\nyou don't `see'\na coe\u000ecient? If you don't `see' a coe\u000ecient, then it is 1 . That is,\nx= (1) xhas coe\u000ecient 1 .\nAlso, x2\ny 3\n= (1) x2\ny 3\nhas coe\u000ecient 1 . It's never necessary to write a coe\u000ecient\nof 1 , because multiplication by 1 doesn't change anything.\nWhat is\nthe coe\u000ecient\nin the term \u0000x? In the term\n\u0000x, the coe\u000ecient is \u00001 , because\u0000x= (\u00001)x .\nIn the term \u0000x2\ny , the coe\u000ecient is \u00001 , because\u0000x2\ny = ( \u00001)x 2\ny .\nconstant terms A term like 2 that has no variable part is called a constant term, because it\nis constant|it never changes. It has no variable part that can `hold' di\u000berent\nvalues. Thus, 1 2\n, p 3 , 9:4 , 9\np 3 , and\n\u00008 103\nare all constant terms.\nconvention\nfor writing terms:\ncoe\u000ecient \frst,\nvariable part last,\nalphabetical order In any term, it is conventional to write the numerical coe\u000ecient \frst. Thus,\nyou should write 4\nxy, not xy4 or x4y.\nAlso, it is conventional to write any variable(s) in alphabetical order. Thus,\nyou usually want to write 5 xy, not 5yx . You should write x2\nyz , not yx2\nz or\nyzx 2\n.\n(1 + 3)(48 + 10) copyright Dr. Carol JVF Burns 232\n\nhttp:\/\/www.onemathematicalcat.org \nget  the complete  book: http:\/\/www.onemathematicalcat.org\/getFullTextFullBook.htm  EXERCISES\n1. In each problem, list the terms. How many terms are there? State the\nvariable part and coe\u000ecient of each term. Identify any constant term(s).\na. 2y \u00003xy + 4x 2\nb. \u00005 + p 2x\n\u0000y+ z like terms:\nthe same\nvariable part\nTerms with the same variable part are called\nlike termsbecause they look `alike'\nas far as the variable part is concerned. The phrase like termscan refer to two\nor more terms.\nThus, 2 xand 1 3\nx\nare like terms. In each term, the variable part is x.\nAlso, x2\n, 1 3\nx 2\n, and p 5x\n2\nare like terms. In each term, the variable part is x2\n.\ncombining\nlike terms Only like terms can be combined, and they are combined by adding the coe\u000e-\ncients. For example, 2x\n+ 5x= 7x and 7y \u00004y = 3y .\nTerms that are notlike terms can notbe combined. For example, there is no\nsimpler way to write 2x + 5yor 7y \u00002y 2\n.\nWhy can\nlike terms\nbe combined? The reason that like terms can be combined is a consequence of the distributive\nlaw, in `backwards' form! Keep reading!\nRecall the distributive law:\na(b+c) = ab+ac .\nWriting it from right to left, we have: ab+ac =a(b +c) .\nConsider the pattern ` ab+ac ' : the terms are aband ac. The term abhas a\nfactor ` a' . The term achas a factor ` a' . The factor ` a' is common to both\nterms.\nNotice that if you `remove' the common part, a, from the term ab, the part\nleft is b.\nNotice that if you `remove' the common part, a, from the term ac, the part\nleft is c.\nIn rewriting ab+ac asa(b +c) , the common factor ais written down \frst, and\nthen an opening parenthesis is inserted. Then, the part remaining from each\nterm is written down: a b\n+ a c\n= a (b\n+c)\nHere's how it looks in a di\u000berent situation:\n2x+ 3x = 2x + 3x =\nx (2 + 3) =\nx(5) = 5x :\nThus, the distributive law is the reason that 2x + 3x= 5x.\nSee how important the distributive law is! The ideas discussed in this paragraph\nwill be explored in more detail in future sections on factoring.\n( 1 3\n+\n2 3\n)(2 + 231)\ncopyright Dr. Carol JVF Burns 233\n\nhttp:\/\/www.onemathematicalcat.org \nget  the complete  book: http:\/\/www.onemathematicalcat.org\/getFullTextFullBook.htm  EXAMPLES\ncombining\nlike terms\nHere are examples of combining like terms:\nExample:\n2x\n\u0000y\u0000 5x + 6y =\u00003x + 5y\nNote that 2 x\u0000 5x =\u00003x and\u0000y+ 6y = 5y. You want to be able to do a\nproblem like this in one step.\nExample:\n1 \u0000 x2\n+ 2x \u00003 + 7x 2\n\u0000 5x = 6x 2\n\u0000 3x \u00002\nNote that 1 \u00003 = \u00002 , 2x \u00005x =\u00003x , and \u0000x2\n+ 7x 2\n= 6x 2\n.\nIn a sum that involves di\u000berent powers of x, it is conventional to order the\nterms from the highest power down to the lowest power, with the constant\nterm coming last.\nExample: 1 2\nx\n\u0000 2 3\nx\n= 3 6\nx\n\u0000 4 6\nx\n= \u00001 6\nx\nNote the usual arithmetic with fractions.\nExample:\n0:4y \u00000:7y =\u00000:3y\nNote the usual arithmetic with decimals.

However, it does|once you apply a popular mathematical\ntechnique called `treat it as a singleton'. Here's how it goes:\nFirst, rewrite the distributive law using some di\u000berent variable names:\nz(c +d) = zc+zd :\nThis says that anythingtimes (c+ d) is the anything timesc, plus the anything\ntimes d.\n(\u00004 \u00001)(\u000046 \u00001) copyright Dr. Carol JVF Burns 235\n\nhttp:\/\/www.onemathematicalcat.org \nget  the complete  book: http:\/\/www.onemathematicalcat.org\/getFullTextFullBook.htm  Now, look back at (a\n+b)(c +d) , and take the group (a +b) as z.
