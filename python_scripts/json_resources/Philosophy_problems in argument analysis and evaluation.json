Today, it is as relevant to\nthe field as when it first appeared, with discussions of questions\nand issues that remain central to the study of argument. It has\ndefinedthemainapproachestomanyofthoseissuesandguided\nthe ways in which we might respond to them. From this\nfoundation, it sets the stage for further investigations and\nemerging research.\nThis is a second edition of the book that is corrected and\nupdated by the author, with new prefaces to each chapter (but\nwithout the previous appendix). We want to acknowledge the\nwork of Ms. Tamilyn Mulvaney who assisted in the editorial\nprocess and prepared the final manuscript for publication.\nLeo A. Groarke\nChristopher W. Tindale\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION vii PREFACE\nPreface to the First Edition\nMy interest in the subjects covered in this book dates from\n1978, when I came across several texts in informal logic, and\nwas fascinated both by their practicality and by their\nrecommendationsforrethinkingcentralphilosophicaltraditions\nregarding logic and argument. I thought at that time that very\nfundamental issues were at stake but that the context of\ntextbooks did not provide sufficient opportunities to explore\nthem in depth. This book is an attempt to fill that gap.\nI have profited very much over the intervening years from\nphilosophical exchanges with Tony Blair, Ralph Johnson, and\nDavid Hitchcock. Comments and analyses from Jonathan Adler,\nDouglas Walton, Richard Paul, Dennis Rohatyn, John McPeck,\nDavid Ennis, Frans van Eemeren, and Rob Grootendorst have\nalso been helpful, as have the interesting questions posed when\nparts of this book have been read to audiences in Canada\n(Lethbridge, Windsor, Calgary, Ottawa, Edmonton, Saskatoon,\nWaterloo, and Peterborough); the United States (Newport News\nand Sonoma); and the Netherlands (Amsterdam). Materials on\ncritical thinking tests were willingly supplied by Matthew\nLipton, Robert Ennis, Stephen Norris, and John McPeck, whose\ncooperationisappreciated.Iwouldalsoliketothanktheeditors\nand contributors to the Informal Logic Newsletter (now the\njournalInformalLogic)fortheirinterestin,andcommentson,my\nwork, especially in the period 1979-1982.\nviiiTRUDYGOVIER IamextremelygratefultotheSocialSciencesandHumanities\nResearch Council of Canada for generous financial support\nduring the period 1982-1984. Without this support, the book\nwould not have been completed. Trent University also provided\nsome support in 1981, enabling Jennifer Dance Flatman to lend\nvaluable bibliographical assistance. Equally important has been\nmoral support \u2013 especially that of David Gallop, William H.\nDray, Bernard Hodgson, Sandy McMullen, Michael Scriven,\nNettieWiebe,JanetKeepingand,mostofall,myhusband,Anton\nColijn. For errors or omissions that may remain, I am solely\nresponsible.\nPrefaceto the Second Edition\nFormanyyears,thisbookhasbeendifficulttoobtain,andIfelt\nbadlyaboutthat.IwasdelightedtolearnthattheseriesWindsor\nStudies in Argumentation was interested in re-publishing the\nwork so as to make both electronic and print versions available.\nAfter some difficulties, I was able to retrieve the copyright from\nthe large Walter de Gruyter firm (Berlin), which had taken over\nthe original publisher, Foris (Dordrecht, the Netherlands) and\ndramaticallyincreasedthepriceofthework.Hopefully,thisnew\nedition will be accessible to all who wish to consult it. People\noften expressed to me their frustration about the inaccessibility\nof the original book. They did not indicate a desire for a re-\nworking of its themes in the light of subsequent research. That,\nin any event, would require a massive amount of work. In this\nsecondeditionIhaveforthemostpartkepttheoriginalmaterial\nintact, while adding introductory essays to each chapter in an\neffort to convey my present sense of what I said decades ago.\nThis book was an early one in the development of informal\nlogic and argumentation studies. My youthful excitement about\ntopicsandproblemsinthesefieldsstemmedofcoursefromtheir\nintrinsic interest but also from my sense that they had rarely\nbeen explored and seemed to emerge, when they did, mainly\nfrom pedagogical experience and treatments in textbooks. I\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION ix wrote my own textbook A Practical Study of Argument (currently\nin its seventh edition), and I enjoyed doing that, but I was\nconvinced that such topics as missing premises, the inductive/\ndeductive distinction, and the principle of interpretive charity\nrequiredtreatmentdifferentfromwhatwouldbeappropriatein\na textbook. Hence, this work. Some topics here \u2014 for example,\nfallacies and social epistemology \u2014 have subsequently been\nexplored by many other theorists. Others, including the\nargument/explanation distinction, a priori analogies, and the\nprinciple of charity, have received less attention. In any event,\nI hope that this version of Problems in Argument Analysis and\nEvaluation will be of interest to persons now active in the study\nof argumentation.\nI am extremely grateful to Michael Williams for his assistance\nin scanning the original book so as to generate electronic files.\nHe and his fast scanner saved me weeks of work.\nThe research, thinking, and writing for this work was done\nin the period 1982 \u2013 1986. During much of that time I was an\nindependent scholar based in Calgary, Alberta, and I benefited\nfromfinancial support fromtheSocial Sciences andHumanities\nCouncil of Canada. Presently my finances are secure, but my\ngratitude to the council persists.\nxTRUDYGOVIER CHAPTER 1.\nRIGOR AND REALITY\nThis chapter was written in an atmosphere of challenged change in\nthe teaching of logic. According to Howard Kahane, whose book on\nfallacies (Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric) went through many\neditions, his interest in that topic stemmed from the career of Spiro\nAgnew. Spiro Agnew was Vice President of the United States from\n1969 to 1973. His highly imaginative and well-publicized rhetoric,\nincorporating such famous expressions as \u201cnattering nabobs of\nnegativism,\u201d led several of Kahane\u2019s students to ask what the tools of\nlogic could offer for the evaluation of Agnew\u2019s claims and arguments.\nKahane realized that formal logic had little to offer, a realization that\nled him to develop his own text, emphasizing the understanding of\nfallacies.Inthatwork,theexamplesweretakenfromAmericanpolitics,\na selection that prompted Ralph Johnson and Tony Blair to produce\ntheirbook,LogicalSelf-Defence,withCanadianmaterial.Thatwork\nwas an important stimulus for my own.\nIn the early nineteen eighties, \u201clogic\u201d as used by philosophers, meant\n\u201cformallogic\u201d,andthestandardpresumptionwasthatbystudyinglogic,\nstudentscouldlearntoreason,detectpoorreasoningandargument,and\nconstruct good arguments. This presumption was coming into question\nin the nineteen eighties but in my experience it was still strongly\ndefended by many philosophers. In the context, I was astounded when\nI heard in 1978 from Michael Scriven \u2013 still active in the field \u2013 that\nformal logic had little or nothing to offer as applied to real arguments\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 1 expressed in natural language. There were problems of translation,\nargument type, structure, premise assessment, dialectical context,\naudience, and much else. For all its rigour and status, formal logic\nwas of little use as applied to real arguments. To me the discovery\nwas shocking. How could philosophers have been so wrong about\npracticalities? Were they deceiving themselves? They prided themselves\non knowing how to argue, but were sadly lacking when it came to\ntheorizing about that. I was not only shocked; I was excited about the\nmany under-explored themes that emerged from this failure.\nIn 2017, the situation has changed significantly. Argumentation\nstudies is a recognized field, inter-disciplinary and international.\nInternational conferences are many, and are well-attended by\nphilosophers,academicsinspeechandcommunicationstudies,cognitive\nscientists, linguists, and others. The term \u201cinformal logic\u201d is used to\nname a thriving and recognized journal. To some extent, the problems\ndescribed in this chapter have disappeared. Not entirely, though.\nPsychologists and neuroscientists may claim expertise in critical\nthinking, unaware of work on argumentation, apparently on the\ngroundsthattheyunderstandsomeoftheworkingsofthebrain.Within\nphilosophy, people are sometimes hired to teach critical thinking,\ninformallogic,orargumentationintheabsenceofanyexpectationthat\nthey should have studied these fields. Among mainstream philosophers,\ntheseareasofstudydonotgenerallyenjoyahighstatus.Certainly,they\narenotaccordedthestatusgiventoformallogic.Eveninadifficultjob\nmarket, it is possible to be hired to teach critical thinking or informal\nlogic without having studied the topics. What is assumed in this\npractice? That a philosopher will have that expertise simply because\nshe is a philosopher? That some background in formal logic will do\nthe trick? That the material is, at root, remedial in nature and simple\nto understand? I cannot claim to know the answer. The phenomenon\ndescribed in this chapter persists to some extent. And it is regrettable.\nThere was a time when science was thought to be perfectly\nobjective, immune from political influences, when scientific\n2TRUDYGOVIER theories were deemed certain and true, when absolute scientific\nproof was thought to be possible. That time has passed.\nPhilosophers of science and scientists themselves now hesitate\nto distinguish categorically between theory and observation,\nbetween metaphysics and science, between conviction by proof\nand the decision to accept.\nLogic is deemed by logicians to be a science, but a comparable\nsense of the ambiguity of things has not been conveyed to\nlogicians.Theycontinuetoregardlogicasafullyobjectivestudy\nin which results can be shown true to anyone who understands\nthe problem and proofs are models of strictness and rigor. Here\nenter no values, no history, no politics, no uncertainty, no\nambiguity.Logic isascience intheold-fashioned sense. Perhaps\nit is the last such science.\n1.The Prestige of Formal Logic\nSince the turn of the century, formal logic has been closely\nlinkedwithmathematics.Aformallogiciandoesnotdohiswork\nprimarily in a natural language. Rather he deals in artificial\nlanguages and formal systems. Here, symbols like \u2018v\u2019, \u2018-\u2018, and \u2018.\u2019\narepreciselydefinedandusedtorepresentacoreelementofthe\nmeaning of such natural words as \u2018or\u2019, \u2018if-then\u2019, \u2018not\u2019, and \u2018and\u2019. In\nsuch systems, every term used has a perfectly precise definition;\nstrict rules govern one\u2019s every move. If natural language\narguments are considered at all, they are re-stated so that their\nstructure (or form) is represented in the symbols of a formal\nsystem. An argument valid in virtue of its form may be provably\nvalidifthisformisthekindofformthesystemhasbeendevised\ntodealwith.Argumentsinwhichconnectionsdependonformal\naspectsnotcoveredbythesystem,oronmeaning,oronfeatures\nthat cannot be handled in deductive logic, do not come out very\nwell by such tests.\nThe highly technical and intimidating nature of formal logic\nas currently practiced by professional logicians can be conveyed\nby a look at just a few recent titles in the field: \u2018Large Matrices\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 3 which Induce Finite Consequence Operations\u2019; \u2018Counterpart\nTheoretical Semantics for Modal Logics\u2019; \u2018S5 without Modal\nAxioms\u2019; \u2018More about the Lattice of Tense Logics\u2019.\nFormal systems are created structures, beloved in some\nquarters for their provision of endless opportunities to\nmanipulate symbols in blissful isolation from the ambiguities of\nreal language and the uncertainties of the real world. \u2018If\u2019 and\n\u2018implies\u2019 in English mean many things in many contexts, but\nthe material implication symbol in standard propositional logic\nmeans one and only one: \u2018p\u2192q\u2019 says that q is never false when p\nis true, and it says nothing other than this.\nLogic, understood as formal logic, has enormous prestige. In\npart, this is because the study of logic is supposed to help us\nconstruct sound arguments, reason well, and find flaws in shaky\nor deceptive arguments. Logic does not describe or explain the\nway people in fact think. Rather, it is an evaluative discipline,\nwhichoriginallywassupposed tosetforthstandardsdelineating\ngood reasoning from poor. Formal logic, however, is now so\ntechnical, so rarefied, and so specialized, that it is greatly\nremoved from this original concept of what logic is supposed to\ndo. A person could study formal logic for years and gain no idea\nthat it was supposed to have anything to do with differentiating\ngood arguments from poor ones.1 Logic as it exists now is\nprimarily the study of artificial formal systems. The idea that it\nhassomethingtodowiththeconstructionandunderstandingof\ngood arguments and the development of critical skills that apply\nto natural discourse surfaces largely in student texts and the\npedagogic rationalizations logic professors offer to curriculum\ncommittees.\nThat formal logic cannot capture all of the factors we need\nwhen we evaluate a real piece of argumentation in a natural\nlanguageis,inanimportantway,quiteobvious.Infact,noformal\nlogician would seriously dispute this claim, for all recognize the\ndistinctionanddifferencebetweenformalandnaturallanguages,\nand the role of information in the premises of arguments. What\n4TRUDYGOVIER is strange is that in view of these substantial gaps between real\narguments and the subject matter of formal logic, formal logic is\nstill widely regarded as having something important to offer to\nthe non-specialist.2 The dichotomy between formal systems and\nthechaoticrealityofdiscourseisnomysterybutthepersistence,\nin the face of this dichotomy, of formal logic as an educational\nand intellectual institution, should give pause for thought.\nSo great is the prestige of formal logic that those who try\nto teach more practical argument and reasoning skills at\nuniversities are under some pressure to label their endeavors\nso as to avoid using the term \u2018logic\u2019. Such activities merit a less\nprestigious title: critical thinking, rhetoric, or communication\nskills,perhaps.Theshockingtruthisthatifcourseshavetheaim\nof treating natural argumentation, there is scarcely a pertinent\nbody of academic expertise on which they can be based.\nNonformal matters pertinent to the assessment of natural\nargumentationhavebeenlongneglected.(SincetheRenaissance,\nsome would say.) Of late, concerned instructors in departments\nof philosophy and literature have come to think that it is\ndesirable to teach students how to identify and evaluate\narguments expressed in ordinary English prose. When they set\nout to do this, they apparently make surprising discoveries.\nTextbooks in applied logic make peculiar reading for the\nphilosopher trained to respect the traditions of formal logic.\nTheir authors seem to have found that when they try to apply\ntraditional logical categories to real arguments in natural\nlanguages, things do not work out well.3\n2. Formal Validity\nIn formal logic, the category \u2018valid\u2019 is of the all-or-nothing\nkind. If an argument is such that, given its premises, it is\nabsolutely impossible for its conclusion to be false, it is valid.\nIf not, it is invalid. Period: there is nothing in between. But for\nmany real arguments, things are not so clear-cut. For example,\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith, discussing inflation, once argued that\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 5 the problem should not be avoided by our becoming content to\naccept inflation as a natural fact of life. He gave a number of\ndistinct reasons for his view: inflation leads to social inequities\nand instability; inflation makes contracts difficult to arrange\nbecausepricesforfuturedatesmaybeuncertain;inflationcauses\ndifficulties in international trade. Now these factors clearly do\nnot substantiate or demonstrate the conclusion in the logician\u2019s\nstrong sense of showing that it is absolutely impossible for that\nconclusion to be false. They are relevant to the point. They\nclearlygosomewaytowardsestablishingit.Galbraithgivesusan\nargument for his view. When we come to assess it, if we follow\nthe canons of formal logic, we are left asking is this argument\nvalid or invalid? And somehow this doesn\u2019t seem like the right\nquestion to be asking. We are inclined to assess the argument\nas one which goes part way toward establishing its conclusion,\nthoughnotalltheway.4Inthefaceoftheseandotherdifficulties,\nphilosophically minded analysts of actual arguments have been\ndriventosuggestthatperhapsvaliditywillhavetobeunderstood\nas a matter of degree, or redefined in terms of an ultimate\nconsensus of reflective normal minds. From the standpoint of\nlogicaltradition,bothproposalsareshockinglyheretical.Validity\nis supposed to be a formally demonstrable and absolute feature\nof an argument.\nThen there are problems with the hallowed old distinction\nbetween inductive and deductive arguments. Most logic texts\nstate that deductive arguments are those that \u2018involve the claim\u2019\nthatthetruthofthepremisesrendersthefalsityoftheconclusion\nimpossible, whereas inductive arguments \u2018involve\u2019 the lesser\nclaim that the truth of the premises renders the falsity of the\nconclusion unlikely, or improbable. This distinction proves\ndifficult to apply to actual arguments.5 Few arguers are so\nconsiderateastogiveusaclearindicationastowhethertheyare\nclaiming absolute conclusiveness in the technical sense in which\nlogiciansunderstandit.Inassessingargumentsweneedtoarrive\natsomeviewastohowgoodthereasonsputforwardare.Asking\n6TRUDYGOVIER whether they were supposed to be conclusive or not is often\nnot a useful stage in the assessment procedure. The distinction\nbetween deductive and inductive arguments is hard to apply to\nactual arguments, and not clearly useful. Yet modern logic has\ndeveloped around this distinction.\nThus traditions wobble against the pressures of the\nsurprisingly new task of analyzing actual arguments. In the face\nofsuchproblems,theteachingofcoursesinpracticallogicisnot\neasy. Surprisingly radical things are suggested by the authors of\ntexts for these courses. With few exceptions, they do not publish\ntheir radical suggestions in professional journals of logic and\nphilosophy. Either they are afraid to buck tradition, or their\nwritings are edited out.6\n3. Actual Arguments\nThe uninitiated reader might wonder why I refer so often to\nactual arguments and what contrast is intended here. An actual\nargument is simply a piece of discourse or writing in which\nsomeone tries to convince others (or himself or herself) of the\ntruth of a claim by citing reasons on its behalf. I speak of actual\narguments because I do not wish to speak of the contrived\narguments-series of statements constructed by logicians to\nillustrate their principles and techniques. It is common practice\nfor a logician to state a principle in a formal system and then\ninvent an \u2018argument\u2019 to illustrate that principle. This custom\nprovides bizarre exercises for logic students. A selection:\nIfshecomescloser,shewillseemevenmorebeautiful.Providedthatshe\nmarries you, she will seem even more beautiful. Hence if she does not\nmarry you, she will not come closer.7\nIfhehastenchildren,thenthatcharacterwillbewrittenonhisface.Ifhis\ncharacteriswrittenonhisface,hecannotdeceiveus.Soeitherhecannot\ndeceive us, or he does not have ten children.8\nIftheweatheriswarmandtheskyisclear,theneitherwegoswimming\norwegoboating.Itisnotthecasethatifwedonotgoswimming,thenthe\nsky is not clear. Therefore, either the weather is warm or we go boating.9\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 7 Any author is successful if and only if he is well read. All authors are\nintellectuals.Someauthorsaresuccessfulbutnotwellread.Thereforeall\nintellectuals are authors.10\nThese sequences of sentences can be more or less represented\nin the apparatus of formal logic, but the so-called arguments\ntheyexpressaretotallyunrealistic.Acommonrationalizationfor\nsetting out such treats before student eyes is that the interesting\ncontent of more realistic arguments, whether these deal with\nissuesofthedayorenduringintellectualconcerns,coulddistract\npeople from purely logical considerations. (For \u2018purely logical\u2019\nhere, read \u2018purely formal and resolvable by a mechanical\nprocedure\u2019.) Critics suspect that the real reason for the strange\nexamples of the logic texts may be that a purely formal analysis\nis only rarely helpful in evaluating that argument. Students need\nexercisestodevelopskills.Sincetheycannotuseformalskillson\nreal arguments, they need invented ones.\nThe science of logic, formal logic, has progressed by ignoring\nreal arguments and attending to constructed systems. Stipulated\ndefinitions and rules make objectivity and rigor possible, but\nonly because the logician is not analyzing a real argument. He\nis doing something else, and doing it very precisely. But when\nhe has completed his task, neither he nor anyone else can easily\napply his formal rules and definitions to anything but his own\nsystems. Nevertheless, formal logic is a venerable intellectual\ninstitution.Ordinarypeople,whoknowlittleaboutit,regarditas\nterriblytechnicalanddifficult,andoftenfeelalittleembarrassed\nabout what they suspect would be their personal ineptitude at\nhigh-levelsymbolmanipulation.(Tellsomeoneyouarewritinga\nbookonlogicandhewillgiveyoualookofrespectyouwillnever\nget if you tell him you are writing on equality or the early Cold\nWar.)\nBecause it deals with the artificial, formal logic can exhibit\nrigor and objectivity. In an artificial system, we can obtain\ncertaintyinresults.Afterall,wehaveprovidedforthisinthevery\nconstruction of the system. Formal logicians primarily devote\n8TRUDYGOVIER themselves to developing systems and to working out the\nimplicationsoftherulesanddefinitionsaroundwhichtheyhave\ndecided to construct those systems. If they theorize about why\nthis or that rule has been adopted, or what the interpretation\nof various systems might be, they call this study philosophy of\nlogic,ratherthanlogicperse.Thegenuinelogician,inthemodern\nworld, is an adept manipulator of symbols, a creator of elegant\nproofs. Proofs in a formal system can be perfectly rigorous; they\ndepend on no undefended move. With such proofs, we know\nexactly where we start, where we finish and why we are entitled\nto make the moves we do. It is the quest for rigor and certainty,\nthe drive to achieve that impeccable result, which has led\nlogicians more and more to concentrate on formal systems.\nBut such rigor and certainty are achieved at the cost of\nemptiness. Real arguments in natural language are not amenable\nto fully precise treatment. They deal with topics of controversy,\ndisputed facts, plausible hypotheses, approximately correct\nanalogies. To evaluate them, we must sort out ambiguities, see\nhow diverse factors fit together, weigh pros and cons, consider\nthe credibility of those on whom we may depend for testimony\nor expertise. Formal logic is, by its very nature, incompetent\nto address such matters. At best, it will apply to (only) some\narguments in natural language, after virtually all interesting\nquestionsabouttheinterpretation,content,andsubstantivetruth\nthey contain have already been resolved.\n4. An Example\nAn example seems the best way to illustrate the truth of this\nclaim.AlasdairMacIntyreoncearguedthatChristianitydoesnot\nrequire any fully objective justification for beliefs about God.\nMacIntyre defended this conclusion by saying that anyone\nfoundinghisreligiousbeliefonanobjectivejustificationproving\nGod\u2019sexistencewould,ineffect,beunfreeinhisbeliefinGod.He\nput it this way:\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 9 (S)upposereligioncouldbeprovidedwithamethodofproof.Supposefor\nexample . . that the divine omnipotence was so manifest that whenever\nanyone denied a Christian doctrine he was at once struck dead by a\nthunderbolt. No doubt the conversion of England would ensue with a\nrapidity undreamt of by the Anglican bishops. But since the Christian\nfaith sees true religion only in a free decision made in faith and love,\nthereligionwouldbythisvindicationbedestroyed.Forallthepossibility\noffreechoicewouldhavebeendoneaway.Anyobjectivejustificationof\nbelief would have the same effect. Less impressive than thunderbolts, it\nwould equally eliminate all possibility of the decision of faith. And with\nthat, faithtoo would have been eliminated.11\nThis is a complex passage, and one has to do some work to\nunearth the main argument. Essentially, it is:\n1. If people were struck dead by being bolted with thunder\nafter denying any Christian doctrine, there would be mass\nconversions due to fear.\n2. Christianfaithseestruereligiononlyinfreedecisionsmade\nin faith and love.\n3. Conversionduetothiskindoffearwouldnotbeduetofree\ndecisions made in faith and love.\nSo,\n4. Conversion by thunderbolt would destroy Christian faith.\n5. Conversion on the basis of an objective justification of\nChristian belief would similarly eliminate all possibility of\nfree decisions made in faith and love.\n6. Therefore,\n7. TheobjectivejustificationofthebeliefsofChristianreligion\nwould eliminate the Christian faith.\nTo decide whether MacIntyre has a good case here, we have,\n10TRUDYGOVIER essentially, to decide how he is using the concept of freedom,\nwhat sort of freedom it makes sense to expect in contexts where\npeople are believing as opposed to acting, how good the\ncomparison between believing from fear and believing on the\nbasisofanobjectivejustificationis,andhowsoundhiscomments\nabout the freedom of the decision to believe being essential to\nChristianfaithare.Noneoftheseissuesareformal.Tobendand\ntwistthisargumentbyanalogyintoarepresentationtowhichthe\nrules of a formal system would apply would be useless even if it\nwere possible.\nNow formal logic is a prestigious academic subject with\nimportant connections with the foundations of mathematics. It\nis not likely to go out of existence, and no one is recommending\nthat it should. The problem is, logic is supposed by many to\nprovide us with standards by which to assess arguments. And\nas it is taught today, formal logic does not adequately do this.\nLogic in western universities and as standardly taught in North\nAmerica has become formal logic and formal logic, whatever its\nhardheaded virtues, simply does not provide a sufficient basis\nfor the assessment of actual arguments.12 Formal logicians who\ntry to support their academic endeavors by making courses\ncompulsoryonthegroundsthatstudents\u2019reasoningwillthereby\nbe improved should be met with scepticism. In view of the\nrupture between the rigorous precision of formal logicians and\nthe complexities of real argumentation, such claims are at best\nthe unthinking repetition of slogans and at worst outright\ndishonesty.\n5. The Desire for Rigor and Certainty\nRigor and the resulting certainty are not ideals that formal\nlogicians have adopted out of perversity and foisted upon an\nunsuspecting public. Rather, they have roots in the history of\nphilosophy,rootsthatgobackatleastasfarasPlato.Mathematics\nhas long been the philosopher\u2019s envy, mathematical knowledge\nthe ideal of perfect knowledge. For mathematics, which is non-\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 11 empirical, is in an important sense liberated from the real world.\nIn mathematics there can be uncontrovertible proofs and perfect\nagreement. Against its eternal verities, philosophical systems\nappear weak and insecure.13 Philosophers have long sought to\nemulate mathematical proofandproducemathematical certainty.\nAccording to Descartes, human knowledge was to be constructed\nsoastopresumenothing.Aftertheapprehensionofanundeniable\nand fundamental truth, one would proceed by clear and\nuncontrovertible proofs to deduce simple, certain propositions\nfrom which, in turn, more complex knowledge could be\nconcluded. Spinoza set his Ethics forward in a system of axioms,\ntheorems and propositions, like a geometric system. Kant\ncompared philosophy unfavorably with mathematics and\nspeculated that the certainty of mathematics came from the fact\nthat in that discipline the mind creates its own objects and is\nthereby able to know them with perfect certainty. The model of\nmathematical knowledge has had immense appeal and influence\nthroughout the history of western philosophy. It is perhaps this\nmodel which motivates formal logicians. Within the artificialities\nof constructed systems, issues are clear, perfectly true answers\npossible, and completely rigorous proofs discoverable.\nNor is the attainment of perfect certainty an exclusively\nphilosophical idea. People do not have to be taught to desire\ncertainty. There is something satisfying and secure in the sense\nthat one can know for certain that what one believes is true,\nthat things must be as one thinks, that anyone who disagrees is\nsimplymistaken.Forteacherssuchknowledgecarriesaposition\nofauthoritynotlikelyinmorerealisticcontexts.Therepremises\nmaybeonlypartiallywarranted,newinformationmayoutweigh\nthat which is at hand, analogies may appear persuasive and yet\nnotentirelyconvincing.\u2018Valid\u2019or\u2018invalid\u2019,wemaypronounceof\nthe stylized, contrived arguments in the formal logic textbooks.\nInreallife,thingsarerarelysosimple.Andyetthe\u2018valid\u2019/\u2019invalid\u2019\nverdict is a more satisfying one than a qualified judgment to the\neffectthatanargumentgivesrelevantreasonsbutnotconclusive\n12TRUDYGOVIER reason for accepting the conclusion.

Perelman wrote in French, but his\nmajorworkshavebeentranslated intoEnglish. Gilbert Ryle,P.F.\nStrawson, Stephen Toulmin, C.L. Hamblin, Carl Wellman, and\nF.L.WillareEnglish-languagephilosopherswhohaveexpounded\nrelated views. In one way or another, several of the English-\nlanguage thinkers have been influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein\nwho, in his later philosophy, railed against the imposition of\nscientificstandardsofrigorandprecisionincontextswherethey\nhad no proper place. Wittgenstein emphasized the value of\nattendingtoparticularcasesandtheconcretephenomenaagainst\nwhich (on his view) general theories should be tested. To follow\nhis advice in developing a logic of argument would constitute a\nradical departure from tradition in logic. For as we have already\nseen, models of correct argument have been stipulated a priori\nand then used to evaluate actual instances of argument.\nThese\u2018backtothephenomena\u2019thinkershavehadexceptionally\nlittleinfluenceonthedevelopmentoflogic.Thoughphilosophers\nno longer venerate Wittgenstein, they continue to study his\nworks.Yettheimplicationsofhismethodologicalviewsforlogic\nitself are rarely remarked.14 The other authors mentioned are\nscarcely read in standard North American graduate programs in\nphilosophy, and rarely considered in university courses in logic.\nToulmin\u2019s book on argument seems to have been the least\nsuccessfulofhismanyworks,amongphilosophersatleast.Itwas\nlargely as a concession to sixties\u2019 student demands for relevance\nthat philosophy departments started to teach courses in which\nactual arguments, expressed in natural language, were the\nprimarybasisforstudy.Onlyrecentlyhavecoursesaboutcritical\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 13 thinking or \u2018informal logic\u2019 been the focus of attention.

The formalist\nideal of rigor and certainty, the model of successful argument\nthat has emerged from formal logic, is Cartesian in concept and\nin origin. Yet it has not been subjected to criticism in logic as it\nhas elsewhere. The distinction between deductive and inductive\narguments, around which modern logic is erected, is closely\nrelated to another distinction philosophers have made, between\nanalytic and synthetic statements. The latter distinction is now\nregardedwithscepticism,asonewhichitisdifficulttodrawwith\nexactitude. Such doubts, however, have not been transferred\nback to the former distinction. The hallowed tradition of\ninductive and deductive seems immune from serious criticism.\nCuriouslyenough,philosophicalargumentsarenotexclusively\ndeductiveincharacter.Theyarenot,onthewhole,validinvirtue\nof logical form alone, not easily translatable into the technical\nsymbolsofformalsystems.Norarephilosophicalargumentslike\ntheargumentsstudiedininductivelogic.Inacceptingthemodel\nof successful argument presumed in traditional logic,\nphilosophershaveputthemselvesinanabsurdposition,because\nthey are unable to apply what passes as a theory of argument to\nmany of their own arguments. This difficulty would be merely\nsilly had it not such a venerable philosophical history.

They did\nnot. Although rigor pulls away from applicability, formal logic\ncontinues to be regarded as a science that offers something\nrelevant to real arguments. To serve this function, however, it\nwould have to offer canons of reasoning and argument that are\nmore than techniques for manipulating symbols in meticulous\nrespectforthestipulatedrulesofanartificialgame.Formallogic\nshows little tendency to develop in this way, yet its practitioners\nseek to maintain its authority as offering the ultimate standards\nagainst which natural arguments should be assessed. Its\ncontinuingauthorityinthefaceofthisdisparityisaphenomenon\nthat calls for explanation. Sociologists of knowledge should take\na look at it.\n6. Paradigms\nWhile awaiting their accounts, I am led to reflect on the\nphilosophy of science of Thomas Kuhn. Philosophers have been\nimpressed and greatly influenced by Kuhn\u2019s work. They delight\ninapplyingittothesocialandphysicalsciencesbutarenotquite\nso ready to apply it to themselves. Certainly no one has been so\npresumptuous as to apply it to the venerable establishment of\nlogic as the formal, entirely rigorous, science of reasoning.\nKuhn introduced to philosophy of science a novel concept,\nthat of the scientific paradigm. A paradigm is an example or\nmodel of successful work which dominates an intellectual field\nto determine what problems will be seen as interesting, what\nmethods will be seen as rational, and what the standard of a\ngoodsolutiontoaproblemwillbe.Kuhnarguedthatstudentsin\nscience are taught, in effect, to see the world in a particular way,\nto ask questions within a specified range, to look in particular\ndirections and not others for answers to those questions. The\nparadigm dominates a science, making consensus and rapid\nprogress possible. Scientific questions and projects remain\nwithin a delimited range, though the limitations become so\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 15 routine to practitioners as to be virtually indiscernible. Kuhn\nregarded paradigms as necessary and therefore legitimate, but\nhe emphasized that their force lies more in education and\nestablished institutions than in their pure objective truth. When\nthereareparadigmshiftsinscience,thesearegroundedasmuch\nin psychological and historical factors as in data or\nexperimentation. So radical is a paradigm shift that Kuhn terms\nit a \u2018revolution\u2019 in scientific theory.\nIt is illuminating to look at the current situation in logic from\ntheperspectiveofKuhn\u2019stheory.Formallyvalidargumentsseem\ntobefunctioningasakindofparadigm.Thisparadigmworksso\nstronglyonformallytrainedlogiciansandphilosophersthatthey\nare unable to take account of the obvious. The obvious is that\nrigorandrealityareuneasymates,thatrealargumentationisnot\neasily or usefully amenable to formal treatment, and that there\nare many interesting nonformal questions about arguments.\nThey cry out for attention.\nIn logic, a paradigm is at work. But it blinds us. I recommend\nrevolution.\nNotes\n1. I once knew someone who did, and did very well in terms\nof marks. However, this comment is less accurate now (1987)\nthan it was when this essay was first written (1980), due to the\ninfluence of practically oriented textbooks and, in some\njurisdictions, such as California, state imposed requirements for\neducation in critical thinking.\n2.ComparePatrickSuppes,Introduction to Logic, (Princeton:Van\nNostrand, 1957), Michael Resnick, Elementary Logic, (New York:\nMcGraw- Hill, 1970), Irving Copi, Symbolic Logic (New York:\nMacmillan, many editions). Copi\u2019s text has been so widely used\nthat it may be said to represent a consensus over some decades.\nIt and other texts traditionally taught formal skills, but\nnevertheless commenced with bold promises as to the practical\n16TRUDYGOVIER advantages a study of the formal subject matter would have,\neven for those not aspiring to be professional logicians or\nmathematicians.\n3. For instance, S.N. Thomas, in his successful text, Practical\nReasoning in Natural Language (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice\nHall 1974) recommends that validity be seen as a matter of\ndegree and boldly claims that the distinction between inductive\nand deductive arguments is a useless dogma.\n4. This reinterpretation is suggested by Carl Wellman in\nChallenge and Response: Justification in Ethics (Carbondale, Ill.:\nUniversity of Illinois Press, 1970). It recalls C.S. Peirce\u2019s notion\nof truth as the doctrine which trained minds will, in the final\nanalysis, come to accept.\n5. Definitions of \u2018inductive\u2019 vary. (Compare \u2018The Great Divide\u2019,\nChapter 3.) The conception I\u2019m alluding to here is common,\nhowever, as one may see from examining a variety of first year\nformal logic texts including those referred to in note 3.\n6.This isless truethanitwasin1980, dueinpart tothesuccess\nof the Informal Logic Newsletter.

I am told by those in the know that this overstates the\nepistemic virtues of mathematics, that nonformal reasoning is\nneededtherealso,andthatformalproofshavebeenfoundwrong\nafter being accepted by mathematicians for decades. If this is\ntrue, then ironically, the formalist model of proof may fail even\nto accurately capture its own paradigm of adequacy.\n14. Notable among Perelman\u2019s works is The New Rhetoric: A\nTreatise on Argumentation (Notre Dame: Notre Dame University\nPress, 1969), written jointly with Mme. L. Olbrechts Tyteca.\nOther works on argument in a \u2018back to the phenomena\u2019 vein\nare Stephen Toulmin, The Uses of Argument (Cambridge, Eng.:\nCambridge University Press, 1958); C.L.

Wittgenstein\u2019s approach is evident in\nhisBlueBook,wherehesaid,\u2018Ourcravingforgeneralityhasanother\n18TRUDYGOVIER main source: our preoccupation with the method of science.

Descartes sought to doubt all his prior beliefs and found a\nsystem on the cogito and deductions from it and basic principles\nof logic. But he presupposed beliefs from ordinary life and\nmedieval philosophy more than he knew, and this was not\naccidental. Hume said that reasonings neither quantitative nor\nexperimental should be committed to the flames in apparent\nobliviousness to the fact that many of his own reasonings fell\ninto that category. Kant stated that we could not know things-\nin-themselves, but seemed committed to knowing the human\nmind and its capacities as more than appearances. The logical\npositivists rejected as meaningless any claim which was not\neither made true by rules governing the use of symbols or\nverified by sense experience. Critics were quick to point out\nthattheir ownkeyprincipleturns outtobemeaningless ifthese\ncriteria are applied to it.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 19 CHAPTER 2.\nIS A THEORY OF ARGUMENT POSSIBLE\nReading this chapter in 2017, I am struck by its length, which seems\nexcessive, and also by my selection of authors covered. The name \u2018John\nMcPeck\u2019 is largely forgotten in philosophical circles today. When I\nwas working on this material, his claims about informal logic and\ncritical thinking posed a significant challenge, both pedagogically and\ntheoretically.\nWould critical thinking not be something different for different\nsubjects?McPeckclaimeditwould.Ifso,howcouldphilosophers\u2013even\nformal logicians \u2013 be justified in their claims to teach it? If informal\nlogic was about good and bad arguments, wouldn\u2019t standards of\nassessment similarly vary from one subject to another? Again, the\nquestionposedapedagogicalchallenge.Asfortheory,onMcPeck\u2019sview\nthere would be nothing general to be said. Those interested in critical\nthinkingandinformallogicwerenotinclinedtoacceptthesechallenges,\nbut felt pressed to respond. My own response is here. McPeck derived\nsome of his views from Stephen Toulmin, whose work on argument\nstructure and appraisal is still studied and used today. Looking back, I\nwould have done better to discuss Toulmin\u2019s account, as distinct from\nthat of McPeck. But I did not. Current versions of discipline-specificity\nhave been developed in detail by Mark Weinstein.\nThe theme of deductivism retains its temptations. I still resist\ndeductivism and would still insist that the fact that a reconstructed\nargument is clear and cogent does not mean that it is an accurate\n20TRUDYGOVIER version of something else. We need to distinguish between the clarity\nof a reconstructed argument and its accuracy as a rendition of the\nunreconstructed version. It remains tempting not to do so. Recently, I\nfinddeductivismmorecommoninapplicationthaninprofessedtheory.\nAs was the case decades ago, deductivism is still used as an ad hoc\npresumption to resolve questions about missing premises.\nAs to Stephen Thomas, a search revealed that his text Practical\nReasoning in Natural Language, went into many editions. There may\nhave been seven. The fourth edition (1997) was several hundred pages\nlonger than the first one. I never met Stephen Thomas or heard him\nspeak. The idea of a spectrum theory, wherein the inference aspect of\nargumentation can be appraised as having degrees of strength, was\ninnovative in its time and retains some interest and plausibility.\nMy notion here of what a theory of argument should include began\nin a traditional way: one would need an account of various legitimate\n(and illegitimate) types of inference and of conditions of premise\nacceptability. These beginnings would seem too narrow today; their\nnarrownessinfactemergedevenasIexploredtheminthemideighties.\nI was led to consider broader aspects: principles of interpretation and\ncriticism; relations between principles of interpretation and standards\nof assessment, and between arguers and their audiences. More recent\nwritings on the theory of argument extend into these and broader\nthemes of discourse, rationality, and rhetoric. Noteworthy is Harald\nWohlrapp\u2019s The Concept of Argument: A Philosophical Foundation\n(German 2008, English 2014).\nExceptincertainlimitedcircles,thereisnorecognizedsubject\ncalled \u2018thetheory ofargument\u2019.Yetthereareclearlyanumber of\nquestions about arguing and argument not answered by formal\nlogic and of considerable importance. A theory of argument\nwould discuss the nature and purpose of argument and specify\nand defend standards for the appraisal of arguments. It would\nspecify how many different types of arguments there are and\nwhat standards are appropriate to assess each type. It would\nexplain when and why it is reasonable to read into discourse\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 21 claims that are not explicitly stated, and whether and how the\npersonalitiesandbeliefsofarguersandaudienceslogicallyaffect\nthemeritsofargumentation.Ideallyatheoryofargumentwould\napplytoallnaturalarguments.Butisthere,orcouldtherebe,any\nsuch thing as a theory of argument?\nAlthough there have been works on the theory of argument\nand calls for such theory in some circles, many remain sceptical\nabout the quest. They regard the theory of argument as a non-\nsubject, unless it is identified with the formal study of valid\nand invalid inference patterns. Such a response \u2013 either there\nis nothing general to be said about arguments or what there\nis to be said is formal and the proper subject of formal logic\n\u2013 was common among philosophers some years back and still\npersists in some quarters. We are used to thinking of the study\nof argument as being primarily a matter of logic, and of logic\nas being primarilyformal; hence the call for a nonformal theory\nof argument may seem novel or contrived. However, such\nquestionsas\u2018Howmanydifferenttypesofargumentsarethere?\u2019,\n\u2018When and why should we regard an argument as having\nunstated premises?\u2019, and \u2018Is the truth of premises too strong a\nrequirement for soundness of argumentation?\u2019, cannot be\nanswered by formal techniques. To respond to them, we need\nobservation, reasoning, the justification of normative standards,\nand philosophical theorizing.\n1. Against the Idea of a Theory of Argument\nIn his book Critical Thinking and Education, philosopher and\neducational theorist John McPeck contends that the very notion\nofanonformaltheoryofargumentisanon-starter.Referringto\na suggestion that the pedagogy and theory of informal logic and\ncritical thinking would be immensely aided by the development\nof a theory of argument, McPeck says:\nWemightaskwhatitwouldbeliketohaveageneraltheoryofordinary\nargument or reasoning. For one thing, the theory would provide a set\n22TRUDYGOVIER of rules or principles to which we could appeal in the evaluation of\narguments.Butifinformallogicianswereeversuccessfulatdeveloping\nall these rules and principles, they would then have a formal logic of\nordinaryargumentorreasoning:thatis,thedesiredtheorywouldvitiate\ntheinformaldimensionoftheirreasoningandrendertheirenterprisea\nbonafidelogic,whichcouldthenbetaughtastheformallogicofordinary\nreasoning.1\nAccording to McPeck, there could not be a nonformal theory\nof argument, because any general account we could produce\nwould be formal.\nTo sort out McPeck\u2019s view it is necessary to distinguish\nbetween a more general and a more specific sense of the key\nword \u2018formal\u2019.2 The word \u2018formal\u2019 may mean \u2018systematic, well-\nordered, having universal or general scope\u2019. In this sense, a\ntheory of argument would surely be a formal theory, just as\ntheories in ethics, political philosophy, and epistemology are (in\nthis sense) formal theories. However, there is no problem about\ninformal logicians developing a theory of argument which is in\nthis broad sense formal. The incompatibility between informal\nlogical principles and a formal theory emerges only when we\nconsider a more specific and narrower sense of \u2018formal\u2019, that\nwhich is intended when we describe such systems as C.I. Lewis\u2019\nS5, or an axiomatized version of number theory as formal\nsystems. Formal systems have clearly stated rules, definite\ncriteriaforwell-formedstringsorformulae,andaxiomstoserve\nas the basis for derivations. They are written in technical, not\nnatural, languages. As formal systems they are not, strictly\nspeaking, about anything; they may be given one or more\ninterpretations. If a formal theory of argument were formal in\nthis sense, that would indeed be incompatible with what\ninformallogicianshavebeensayingaboutarguments.Theyhave\nbeen saying that formal systems do not cover all the topics we\nneedtoraiseindiscussingnaturallanguagearguments,andthat\nmany such topics bring in nonformal questions about context\nand substance.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 23 Informallogicians,contestingthedriveforcompleterigorand\npurity among formalists, contend that the appraisal of natural\narguments requires something other than translation into a\ntechnicalformallanguageandapplicationofformalrulestotest\nvalidity.However,itisonlyinthenarrowersenseof\u2018formal\u2019that\ninformal logicians deny that a theory of natural argument will\nbe a formal theory. Nothing precludes the development, within\ninformal logic, of a theory of argument that is formal in the\nbroader sense.\nMcPeck\u2019s claim that informal logicians would vitiate\nthemselves and \u2018go formal\u2019 if they ever managed to develop a\ntheoryofargumentisbasedonafailuretodistinguishthesetwo\nsenses of \u2018formal\u2019. McPeck has, in effect, conflated the general\nand the formal.3 A perfectly general principle might be\nformulated,handlingsuchanissueaswhenanarguer\u2019spersonal\nreliability is relevant to the acceptability of his or her premises.\nSuch a principle would not be formal in the sense of being in\nan artificial language or of being an axiom or rule in a formal\nsystem, but could nevertheless be part of a general theory of\nargument.4\nAs it occurs in \u2018formal logic\u2019, the word \u2018formal\u2019 usually has\nthe second, narrow meaning explained above. In this sense of\n\u2018formal\u2019 there is no more reason to believe that the principles of\na theory of argument would be formal than there is to believe\nthattheprinciplesofmoral,political,orepistemologicaltheories\nwouldbeformal.Thatistosay,thereisnoreasonatalltobelieve\nthis.\nSince logic has for so long been regarded both as intrinsically\nformal and as the science or art of argument, the move from\n\u2018it\u2019s a general theory of argument\u2019 to \u2018it\u2019s a formal theory of\nargument\u2019 may seem enticing and plausible. But it has no more\nforce than the analogous move for moral or scientific theories;\nthat means that it has no force.\nIn fact, theories of argument that are, in the requisite sense,\nnonformal are more than possible. They are actual. Although\n24TRUDYGOVIER many philosophers seem to hold that the theory of argument is\na non-subject, many others (and some of the same ones) hold\nphilosophical theories of argument to which they frequently\nappeal for pedagogical and other purposes. Some popular\ntheoriesareinadequateinvariousways.Thereisanunfortunate\ntendency to state such theories in a few words and go on to\nappeal to them as the basis for other work. So far, theories of\nargument have been more epigrammatic than thoughtful.\n2. AreArgument Standards Discipline-Specific?\nThough he contends in Critical Thinking and Education that\nthere can be no such thing as a nonformal theory of argument,\nJohn McPeck in fact states a nonformal theory of argument in\nthat same work. He puts forward a discipline-specific theory in\nwhich the understanding and evaluation of arguments is left as\na task for particular academic disciplines. This theory maintains\nthat the premises and inferences of all natural arguments are\nproperly assessed only by reference to the standards of one or\nmore specific disciplines. Standards for sound argumentation\nmay vary from one discipline to another, according to this\ntheory. There are as many types of good arguments (at least)\nas there are disciplines. Any attempt to develop general, cross-\ndisciplinary standards of argument is misguided. A good\nargument in physics satisfies standards quite different from\nthose which are applicable to a good argument in law or in\nhistory. Evaluating arguments requires critical thinking and\ncritical thinking amounts to a judicious, reflective scepticism\nwhich must be based on a sound knowledge of the inner\nworkings of a particular area of thought.\nMcPeck proposes his discipline-specific theory as follows:\nSince critical thinking is always critical thinking about X, it follows that\ncritical thinking is intimately connected with other fields of knowledge.\nThus the criteria for the judicious use of scepticism are supplied by the\nnorms and standards of the field under consideration.5\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 25 Just as the rules of a particular game do not necessarily apply to other\ngames,socertainprinciplesofreasonapplywithinsomesphereofhuman\nexperience but not in others. A principle of reason in business or law, for\nexample,mightbefallaciousinscienceorethics.Thisisneithersurprising\nnor profound but it is a point that is continually obscured by informal\nlogicians and it may explain their optimism about the development of a\ngeneral theory of argument.6\nThe existing disciplines are already steeped in their own reasoning\nprocedures, fallible as they might be at times. But learning to use those\nprocedures properly involves learning the idiosyncrasies of those\ndisciplines.7\nMcPeck is led to a discipline-specific theory partly by a study\nof Stephen Toulmin\u2019s works and partly by the idea \u2013 expressed\nin the first passage quoted above \u2013 that arguments deal with\nspecific subjects andeachspecific subjectislocatedwithinsome\ndiscipline or other. His presupposition here is, apparently, that\nthe norms come from the subject matter.\nToulmin wrote an early book, The Uses of Argument, decrying\nthe dominance of formal logic in argument analysis. He urged\nthat there were many diverse types of argument appropriate to\ndiverse human activities. Several decades later, he followed his\nearlymonographwithatext,coauthoredwithRichardRiekeand\nAllanJanik.8Thetextechoestheearliertheory.However,itdoes\nimpose a common structure on argumentation. Each argument\nhas,accordingtoToulmin,aclaim(whatstandardanalysiswould\ncall the conclusion), a ground or grounds for the claim (in\nstandardaccounts,thepremises),andawarrantandbacking.The\nwarrant is a general proposition linking the grounds and claim\nand the backing is comprised of other claims that can be used\nto back up the warrant. For example, a simple argument such as\n\u2018you shouldn\u2019t smoke because you might get lung cancer\u2019 would\nbe seen as having \u2018you might get lung cancer\u2019 as the ground and\n\u2018you shouldn\u2019t smoke\u2019 as the claim. The warrant, which must be\nconstructed and read into the argument, would be something\nlike \u2018Smoking often causes lung cancer\u2019. The backing would be\n26TRUDYGOVIER found in the medical theories which support belief in the\nwarrant.\nToulmin emphasizes the important role of disciplinary\nknowledgeandproceduresintheunderstandingandappraisalof\nargument. Thus it is in some sense natural that McPeck should\nappeal to his account for support.\nIn another way, however, what Toulmin says is not consistent\nwith what McPeck wants to say. Oddly enough, in view of\nToulmin\u2019sstrongdissentfromtraditionallogicalapproaches,his\nanalysis commits him to imposing a common structure on all\narguments.Theywillallhavethesamemodus ponensform,when\nthe warrant is supplied. And yet there are cases where the fit is\nratherunnatural.Eveninthesimpleexampleaboutsmoking,for\ninstance, we have to restrict ourselves to backing and warrant\nfrom one field in order to make Toulmin\u2019s style of analysis fit.\nWhy not supplement the medical evidence with a claim about\nobligations not to unnecessarily risk one\u2019s health and a backing\nfrom canons of ethics or prudence? If we did this, we would\nimmediatelyhaveanargumenttowhichatleasttwo\u2018disciplines\u2019\nwere relevant.\nDespite some rather dramatic statements to the contrary,\nToulmin is in fact committed to the belief that there are many\ngeneral points about argument structure and evaluation which\nare correctly super-imposed (as it were) on the standards of the\nvarious disciplines. This makes his account an unpromising\nsource for a view such as McPeck\u2019s, which disclaims any\npossibility of general standards working across disciplines.\nThereceptionofToulmin\u2019sideasonargumentisitselfamatter\nof some interest. His ideas have been roundly rejected by most\nphilosophers and yet have gained wide acceptance in other\ncircles, notably among scholars of argumentation whose\nbackground is in rhetoric or communication, rather than logic\nand philosophy. Nevertheless, an examination of several recent\naccounts of Toulmin\u2019s theory seems to indicate that the\nphilosophers\u2019 rejection was on solid grounds.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 27 In an excellent and thorough review of Toulmin\u2019s text, Ralph\nJohnson worked hard with his theory and eventually decided\nthat it faced serious problems.\nManyofthewarrantsToulmincitesasexamplesdonotseemtobelong\nto any identifiable field.

They offer many criticisms, among them the\nfollowing, regarding Toulmin\u2019s positing of four essential\nelements in argument (claim, ground, warrant, and backing)\ninstead of the traditional two (premises and conclusion):\nIn fact, however, he assumes in his model that the data (grounds) are\naccepted at face value; if this is not the case, then, he says, it will have\ntobemadethecasebywayofapreliminaryargument.Thenthedatum\nfromtheoneargumentwillbetheclaimintheother.Thereisabsolutely\nno reason why the same should not apply to the warrant. If a warrant\nis not immediately accepted as authoritative, then an attempt must be\nmade to remove the objections to it by means of another argument, in\nwhichthewarrantfromthefirstargumentappearsastheclaim.Andif\nan argument contains a backing for the warrant, then in fact there are\ntwo arguments.10\nAt this point it should be clear that no solid basis for McPeck\u2019s\ntheory can be found in Toulmin\u2019s theory.\nThe other line of thought that leads McPeck to a discipline-\nspecific theory is equally unconvincing. He reasons that since\neveryargumentandeverythoughtareaboutsomespecificthing,\n28TRUDYGOVIER and since every specific thing is properly understood within\nsome specific discipline, every argument is properly assessed\nonly with reference to the standards of some specific discipline.\nThisargumentisglaringlyincomplete,asreviewersofMcPeck\u2019s\nbook were quick to note.11 The opening premise is obviously\nuncontroversial. Surely all thought is about some subject. You\ncannot just think, without thinking about some thing or other.\nHowever, it does not follow that that something or other is\nappropriately located in some one academic discipline. Also,\nfrom the fact that thought must be about an object, we certainly\nare not entitled to conclude that standards for appraising that\nthought fall into the one specific discipline (in which the object\nis located).\nMcPeckgivesnogoodgroundsforhisviewthatargumentsfall\ninto distinct disciplines and that only these disciplines can offer\nthe proper tools for their understanding and evaluation.\nEvenifweweretograntMcPeck\u2019sassumptionthatarguments\nfall into disciplines, those disciplines might very well employ\ncommon standards of reasoning. Indeed, this is what\nphilosophers and others have commonly supposed. McPeck\nobviously dissents from this view but he nowhere gives a\nsufficient logical, epistemic, or psychological basis for his\ndissent. In response to critics, McPeck has indicated that the\nphilosophical background for his view is to be found in\nWittgenstein and should be understood as an adaptation of\nWittgenstein\u2019snotionofformsoflife.Butsuchareferenceoffers\npoor logical support, given the notorious slipperiness of this\nWittgensteinian notion. McPeck seems so convinced of the\ndiscipline dependence of argument analysis that he simply\nassumes that there are no common standards of reasoning in\ndifferent disciplines.\nAdiscipline-specifictheoryofargumentcanbestatedinmore\nor less radical versions. If the theory insists only that in order\nto evaluate the premises of arguments, we need information,\nwhich will come from various different disciplines, then it is\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 29 relatively uncontroversial. No logician formal or informal \u2013 has\never denied this first view of what it means to be discipline-\nspecific. None has ever seriously claimed that logic alone could\nsupplythenecessarytoolstodeterminethetruthoracceptability\nof the premises of arguments, and few would be so bold as to\nmaintain that logic gives you all you need to be a critical\nthinker.12PresumablyMcPeckdoesnotmeanonlytoclaimthis\nfirst view that some extra-logical information is needed for the\nevaluation of arguments; otherwise he would not be so strongly\nobjecting to the theory of argument as a general subject. More\nsignificantly, a discipline-specific theory might state a second\nview to the effect that some judgments about the merits of some\ninferences can only be made from within specific disciplines.\nThat qualified claim is suggested when McPeck says \u2018a principle\nof reason in business or law, for example, might be fallacious in\nscience of ethics.\u2019 Most radical would be a third view, according\nto which all appraisal of both premises and reasoning depends\non standards which are developed by, and only intelligible\nwithin,theparticulardisciplines.Onthisthirdviewtherewould\nbe no such thing as a good analogy or invalid syllogism as such.\nThere would be good analogies-within-psychology, invalid\nconditional arguments-within-law, and so on.\nMcPeck\u2019smajorpedagogical claimisthatattemptstoimprove\nreasoning and critical thinking by offering separate courses in\neither formal or informal logic are misguided, as they presume\nfalse theories of reasoning and argument. The uses to which\nMcPeckseekstoputhisview,andthesupplementarycomments\nhe makes about it, require that he endorse the third and most\nradicalversionofdiscipline-specificity.Itisonlyonthisversion\nthat the idea of teaching generally applicable standards of\nargument appraisal would cease to make sense. The major\npurpose of McPeck\u2019s book is to make a point about educating\npeople to think critically. He contends that it is not possible\nto do this by teaching formal logic, informal logic, or critical\nthinking as distinct subjects. The correct way to do it, he says,\n30TRUDYGOVIER is to teach the separate academic disciplines in an epistemically\nalertwaysoastocultivateinstudentsajudiciousscepticismthat\nis appropriate to whatever particular subject is being studied.\nMcPeck\u2019s account combines a theory of argument with a\npedagogical theory of critical thinking. The first view holds\nnothingnovel.IfMcPeckweretoholdonlythequalifiedsecond\nviewhewouldhavetoadmitthattherecouldbemanyusefuland\nimportant cross-disciplinary standards for good argument and\nthat these might fruitfully be taught in critical thinking courses\nthat were generally about good and poor reasoning. This view\nwould not support McPeck\u2019s strong pedagogical claims. He\nneeds the third view.\nNo one would dispute the first view. Indeed, typically\nargument premises cannot be assessed without the particular\nknowledge which often comes from specific disciplines. This\nobvious truth does not entail that a discipline-specific theory\nof argument is true, however; it says nothing about types of\narguments, types of inference, means of appraising inference,\nand so on. The second view says something about some\narguments, and issues a warning that we should not expect\nstandards to transfer automatically from one area to another.\nThis modest version of the discipline-specific theory may be\ncorrect. It does not preclude either the possibility of standards\nthat apply to most arguments, or the existence of general\ncategories of classification which would transcend disciplinary\nboundaries. It is possible, for instance, that this second view\nshould be true and that the third view is false. Such patterns\nas modus ponens, analogies, syllogisms, and inductive\ngeneralizations are found in a wide variety of contexts and\ndisciplines, and should be assessed from the same standpoint,\nusing the same rules, whenever they occur.\nThe third view, which amounts to a radical discipline-specific\ntheoryofargument,issimplynotplausible.Firstofall,notevery\nsubject fits neatly into one and only one academic discipline.\nAn argument about nuclear weapons development, for instance,\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 31 mightverywellincludebothpsychologicalconsiderationsabout\nthe likely reactions of an enemy to a strategy and financial\nconsiderations regarding the comparative costs of conventional\nandnuclear weapons. Indeed, discussions ofissues pertaining to\nnuclear weapons quite commonly draw from politics, history,\nmilitary strategy, ethics, and engineering, as well as psychology\nand economics. Many issues are like this one, and many\narguments about them do not fit well into a neat framework of\nestablished academic fields or disciplines.\nThepointwasputhumorouslybyPerryWeddle,whosaidina\nreview of McPeck\u2019s book:\n\u2026RecallOneWeekintheLifeoftheTypicalEducatedPerson.Fiveto\ntenhoursreadingthenewspaper:TherewasthecaseofArielSharon,a\ncartoondepictingReaganasWesterngunslingerconfrontingAndropov,\nan editorial defending multiple-choice exams for teachers.

The Typical Educated Person argued politics, music,\npsychology, sports, religion \u2026 Academic fields cover only a fraction of\nsuch stuff.13\nA discipline-specific theory of argument will be hard to apply\nin practice because it will require us to sort arguments in a way\nthat is most unfaithful to action discussion, decision-making,\nand debate.\nThere are also more theoretical arguments against discipline-\nspecific standards of argumentation and reasoning. Even if we\ncould put every argument in its own disciplinary cubby-hole,\nwe cannot guarantee that existing academic disciplines as we\npresently understand them accurately reflect the ontology of\n32TRUDYGOVIER the real world in the ways in which they divide and categorize\nobjects and problems.\nA discipline-specific theory of argument such as the third\nversion, which is so radical as to claim that all the important\nstandards of argument appraisal are specific to the various\nacademic disciplines, is simply implausible. In many respects,\nvarious disciplines atleast appear toemploycommonstandards\nof reasoning at a number of significant points. In all disciplines,\nwefindaconcernforconsistency;theneedtorelyontestimony\nsomeofthetimeandanattendantconcerntodistinguishreliable\nfrom unreliable testimony; the need to deduce further\nconclusionsfromexplicitlystatedknowledge;occasionalusesof\nanalogies; and many other apparently similar logical features. It\nispossiblethatinsomesubtlewaystheappraisaloftestimonyis\nlogically different in history, physics, and law. But such a claim\nhasnotbeenshownevenforoneaspectofargumentation,andit\nis highly unlikely that it would be true for all.\nThe continuity and co-ordination of distinct disciplines\nduring some periods of history and with reference to some\nspecific topics would be hard to account for if each discipline\nhad its own standards of reasoning, so embedded within the\ndiscipline that they could not be \u2018detached\u2019 and applied to\ndiscussions within other disciplines. So too would the tradition\nof successful external criticism of disciplinary practices.\nFor all these reasons the discipline-specific theory in the\nstrong form advocated by McPeck has small claim to be a\ndescriptivelyaccuratetheoryofargument.Norisitnormatively\nappealing, because it is implicitly uncritical and conservative. If\nexisting disciplines are to provide us with the only standards\nappropriate to use for the assessment of argument, then it will\nbe impossible to give a good argument for the conclusion that\nthe standards of any one of these disciplines are flawed. This is\na counter-intuitive result that leaves too little room for rational\ncriticism of disciplinary practice. In addition, it is untrue to the\nactual history of thought. Strong criticism of disciplines both\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 33 from within and without is a prominent feature of the actual\nhistory of academic subjects.\nInshort,aradicaldiscipline-specifictheoryofargumentisnot\ntenable. It will pose many problems of application; it does not\nofferanaturaldescriptionofthephenomenaofargument;andit\nis normatively too weak.\n3.Are All Good Arguments Deductively Valid?\nAnother theory of argument, more popular among\nphilosophers than the discipline-specific theory, is the\ndeductivist theory. According to this theory, there is no need to\nsortargumentsbydiscipline,forthereisfundamentallyonlyone\ntype of (good) argument. A good argument must be deductively\nvalid: the premises must entail the conclusion. In a good\nargument, itislogicallyimpossible fortheconclusion tobefalse\nprovided that the premises are true. Furthermore, the premises\nare true. Because the argument is deductively valid, the true\npremises provide full and sufficient reasons for the conclusion,\nand thus justify it. Thus good arguments should serve the\npurpose of convincing an audience that a conclusion is true. All\ngood arguments are as tight and firm as proofs in mathematics.\nThey are comparable to \u2018All men are mortal; Justin Trudeau is\na man; therefore Justin Trudeau is mortal\u2019, in that true premises\nare stated, and provide compelling, conclusive support for a\nconclusion. Any argument not meeting these conditions is\nlogically inconclusive and, as failing to meet these standards,\nlogically worthless.\nMany logicians \u2013 both formal and informal \u2013 endorse a\ndeductivist theory of argument. These theorists are aware that\nmost naturally occurring arguments fail to be deductively valid\nas stated. Few wish to draw the conclusion that most naturally\noccurring arguments are worthless. To avoid this consequence,\ndeductivistsoftenurgethatmanynaturallyoccurringarguments\nare enthymemes. They need to be \u2018filled in\u2019 with premises that\nwere unstated by the arguer. Many naturally occurring\n34TRUDYGOVIER argumentscanbefilledinwithtrueorplausiblepremisesinsuch\na way that the amended set of premises entails the conclusion;\nthey thereby qualify as inferentially good arguments on the\ndeductivist theory.\nInapaperondeductivismpublishedin1970,D.Stovereported\nbeing unable to find any explicit statements or defenses of the\ntheory, which he nevertheless claimed was a basic tacit\nassumptionofmanyphilosophers.14Stovearguedingreatdetail\nthat Hume was a deductivist, in order to show that the critique\nof the theory presented in his article had some real application.\nPresently, statements of deductivism are rather easy to find in\ntexts and other sources. Here is one from a text on formal logic,\nby Karel Lambert and William Ulrich. (Lambert and Ulrich do\nnot purport to cover informal logic in the text; however they do\npurport to eliminate it as a legitimate subject of study.) They say:\nAnargumentissoundifandonlyif(1)itisvalidand(2)allitspremises\naretrue.Aninferenceissoundjustincasetheargumentrepresentingit\nis sound.15\nThisisaclassicstatement.Furtherexplanationinthetextmakes\nit clear that Lambert and Ulrich understand \u2018valid\u2019 to mean\n\u2018deductively valid in virtue of form\u2019.16 That is, the premises\nwould have to entail the conclusion, and the entailment\nrelationship would have to hold in virtue of the structure of\nthe argument, as based on standardly logical words such as \u2018all\u2019,\n\u2018some\u2019, \u2018none\u2019, \u2018not\u2019, \u2018if then\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, and so on.\nFormal deductivism would have it that all good arguments\nare deductively valid in virtue of their logical form; nonformal\ndeductivism that they are deductively valid in virtue either of\nmeaningorofform.Itisoftenimportanttodistinguishbetween\nformalist and nonformalist versions of deductivism. Lambert\nand Ulrich do not clarify this distinction. However, the points\nmade here apply to both versions, so the distinction will be\nignored for the moment. In the simple deductively valid\nargument \u2018Joan has a cousin; therefore Joan has a parent who\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 35 has a sibling\u2019, validity is due to the meaning of \u2018cousin\u2019, \u2018parent\u2019\nandsoon,nottologicalform.Thisargumentisdeductivelyvalid\nin virtue of the meaning of such terms, and not in virtue of its\nlogical form.\nThe central claim of deductivism is that anything less than\na relation of entailment between premises and conclusion is\nunsatisfactory. On this theory there are no degrees or kinds of\nlogical support. Lambert and Ulrich\u2019s statement of deductivism\nalso includes a condition that premises must satisfy: they must\nbe true. This condition has been questioned as too strong; but\nwe shall skirt that issue at the moment and consider only those\naspects of deductivism that concern the classification of\narguments and the appraisal of inferences.17\nLambert and Ulrich\u2019s book is a text on formal logic. But\ndeductivism is not restricted to formalist circles. Deductivist\nviewsarealsotobefoundintextsoninformallogic,asweseein\nGerald Nosich,Reasons and Arguments:\nTruthandvalidityaretwobasicconceptsinlogicalanalysisbecause,for\nanargumenttobesound(toproveitsconclusion),itmustbebothvalid\nandhavetruepremises.Moreover,ifyouhaveavalidargumentandall\nofitspremisesaretrue,youhaveprovedtheconclusion.Whenitcomes\nright down to it, validity and truth of the premises are all there is to a\ngood argument.18\nChallenging the view, Carl Wellman\u2019s book, Challenge and\nResponse,has this to say about deductivism:\nDeductionisthatformofreasoninginwhichtheclaimismadethatthe\nconclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If it is possible for all\nthe premises to be true and the conclusion false, then the argument is\ninvalid;ifthetruthofthepremisesisasufficientconditionforthetruth\nof the conclusion, then the argument is valid. It is deductive reasoning\nthat has been the traditional subject matter of logic. Deductivism is\nthe view that this is the only form of reasoning. If so, and if only\nreasoning can justify any statement, then clearly all justification is by\n36TRUDYGOVIER deduction.Theobviousquestiontoaskiswhatreasonthereistoaccept\ndeductivism.19\nAlthough deductivism is stated by Wellman as a theory about\nreasoningandnotatheoryaboutarguments,themovefromone\nto the other is immediate, in context. If all arguments are based\non reasoning, and all reasoning is deductive, then all arguments\nare based on deductive reasoning. Wellman states deductivism\nin order to criticize it. He does not hold this theory himself. He\nbelieves,rather,thattherearemanyplausible naturalarguments\nwhich it does not readily apply and he objects to the way in\nwhichpremiseshavetobeaddedinordertomakesomeofthese\nnaturally occurring arguments deductively valid.\nStove distinguishes two senses of conclusiveness for\narguments. Arguments are positively conclusive if the premises\nwould give a completely rational being some positive degree of\nbelief in the conclusion, and they are absolutely conclusive if\nthey would give such a being as great a degree of belief in the\nconclusionasthereisforthepremises.Anargumentisabsolutely\nirrational if the premises would add no support whatever to the\nconclusion.20 With this apparatus, Stove defines deductivism as\nthe thesis that all deductively invalid arguments are absolutely\nirrational. Stove then goes on to point out that deductivism\nentails the epistemic equivalence of \u2018All of the ten flames\nobserved in the past have been hot, so the next flame observed\nwillbehot\u2019and\u2018Alloftheone million flames observedinthepast\nhave been hot, so the next flame observed will be hot.\u2019 It entails\nthat these two arguments are equally, and absolutely, irrational.\nThe extremity of this conclusion implied by deductivism makes\nStovefearheisaddressingastrawman.Butashepointsout,the\nrather common philosophical practice of showing an argument\nto be invalid and then inferring immediately that no further\ncriticismofitisneeded,doespresupposedeductivisminjustthis\nextreme form.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 37 3a.Deductivismas a Simple Theory\nDeductivism has the advantage of being an extremely simple\ntheory of argument. On this theory, there is only one type of\nargument; therefore there is no need to sort or classify\narguments and to develop criteria for doing so. Problems\nregarding examples that do not fit tidily into the requisite\nclassificatory categories do not arise: there is only one category.\nThere is only one type of argument, deductive, and only one\nstandard for appraising the quality of the inferential aspect of\narguments. This requirement all arguments will have to satisfy.\nInsystemsofformallogicthereareclearlyarticulatedstandards\nforformaldeductivevalidity.Ifdeductivismisthecorrecttheory\nof argument, we have the assured relevance of an established\nand recognized body of precise knowledge, applicable to all\narguments.\nThis simplicity comes at a cost, however. There are alternate\nways of paying. One way is to face the consequence Stove spells\nout so clearly: all invalid arguments are equally and totally\nflawed. Since most arguments in empirical science and in\nordinarylifearenot,asstated,deductivelyvalid,thistheorywill\nleave the deductivist in a radically sceptical position. Indeed,\nif we have no view as to how the accumulation of empirical\nevidence can rationally support hypotheses, it is a mystery as\nto how we can ever generate the premises that are needed for\ndeductively valid arguments. This difficulty was emphasized by\nJohn Stuart Mill and, in a different way, by Sextus Empiricus.\nMostcontemporarydeductivistswillnotpaysuchahighprice\nand prefer instead to borrow in the currency of reconstruction.\nRecognizing that most natural arguments are not deductive as\nstated,theyregardsuchargumentsasincomplete.Toapplytheir\ntheory in a plausible and non-sceptical way to naturally\noccurring arguments, they reconstruct them, seeing them as\nhavingtacitpremisesnotspelledoutbythearguer.Argumentsin\nlaw, ethics, administration, empirical science, literary criticism,\n38TRUDYGOVIER and ordinary life do not look like the watertight proofs of\nmathematics. As stated, they are rarely deductively valid. To\navoid the conclusion that they are all equally and absolutely\n\u2018irrational\u2019,these arguments areregardedasenthymematic. This\napproach is surely preferable to the radically sceptical and\ncounterintuitive consequence of applying the theory literally to\nunreconstructed natural arguments. Nevertheless, it too is\ncostly.\nThe pro-and-con situation in which we find ourselves with\nmany issues does not naturally fit a deductivist account, which\nmakes the merit of an argument an all-or-nothing affair. When\na natural argument is supplemented, and thereby rendered\ndeductively valid, the added premises are regarded as \u2018missing\u2019.\nThe deductivist will say that they were implicit in the original\nargument, but left unstated for one reason or another. Perhaps\ntheyweretooobvioustomentionandrecognizedassuchbythe\narguer and the audience. Perhaps they were controversial and\ndeliberately omitted. Perhaps they were omitted simply because\nthe arguer lacked a perfect \u2018deductive sense\u2019 and didn\u2019t\nunderstand that they were required to make the argument valid.\nThe deductivist who wishes to avoid radical scepticism about\nnaturally occurring arguments has no problem classifying\narguments and no problem deciding which inferential standard\ntoapplytowhichargument.Hedoes,however,havetofacequite\na task reconstructing natural arguments. Since few arguments,\nas stated, are deductively valid, a deductivist who seeks to avoid\nscepticism is committed to a \u2018reading-in\u2019 policy which is\nextensive. This involves labor, but that is the least of the\nproblems.\nA major challenge lies in the fact that any argument can be\nsupplemented with extra premises in such a way as to make it\ndeductively valid. In fact, some texts advise students to do this.\nIf all else fails, an argument can be made deductively valid by\naddingapremiseoftheform\u2018If(P,Q,R,J)thenC\u2019,whereP,Q,R\nandJarethestatedpremisesandCistheconclusion.Theadded\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 39 statement is a conditional with the stated premises, conjoined,\nas the antecedent and the conclusion as the consequent. Such\na statement is commonly referred to as the associated\nconditional.21 To some this reiterative procedure seems a mere\nsubterfuge, buttoothers itappears anatural manoeuvre\u2013quite\nlegitimate. An associated conditional can always be formed, and\na determined theorist can always insist that it was implicit in\nthe argument. A major problem with this view, though, is that\nforeverynaturallyoccurringargumentthereissuchanavailable\nassociated conditional. There is, then, always a way to make an\nargument deductively valid, whether or not it was valid in its\nunreconstructed form.22\n3b.Deductivismand Missing Premises\nThough preferable to literal deductivism the reconstructivist\napproach is cumbersome and, for that reason, objectionable. In\nmany cases it also appears to misrepresent the character of the\noriginal argument. There are reasons, surely, why arguments\nfrom observation and experience have been characterized\nhistorically as different in degree of conclusiveness from the\ndeductive arguments of geometry and mathematics. Even if we\nconsider a ridiculous argument, such as \u2018Roses are red; violets\nare blue; therefore Ed loves Sue\u2019, we can render it deductively\nvalid. We just add a premise \u2018If roses are red and violets are\nblue,EdlovesSue\u2019,andinsistthatthisassociatedconditionalwas\nimplicit, but unstated, in the original. The addition is reiterative\nin that it merely repeats the original argument, turning it into\na conditional statement that links the premises with the\nconclusion. If one acknowledges a problem with simple\nreiteration, one can avoid it by generalizing on this reiterative\ncondition. For instance, one could instead regard \u2018If some\nflowers are coloured, then all people called Ed love all people\ncalled Sue\u2019 as the unstated premise.\nThereisalwaysawaytomakeanyargumentdeductivelyvalid\nby adding premises. Furthermore there is always more than one\n40TRUDYGOVIER way. If you don\u2019t like merely reiterating the whole argument,\nyou can choose from countless prospective premises which will\nentail the reiterative conditional statement. Literal deductivism\nhas the consequence that almost all arguments in empirical\nscience, scholarly endeavor and ordinary life are absolutely\nworthless. But reconstructive deductivism, unless very\nelaborately qualified, will have the consequence that they are\nall absolutely worthy, from an inferential point of view.23 This\nconsequence emerges because any argument can easily be\nrendered valid, and the reconstructive thrust behind this theory\ncommits us to regarding the content of argument as largely\nindeterminate.\nDespite the prominence of reconstructive deductivism as a\ntheoryofargumentanddespiteitscompatibilitywithsignificant\nelements of logical theory and pedagogy, it ultimately runs\ncounter to strong traditions in logic. One such tradition is that\nthere are nonconclusive but nevertheless reasonable arguments,\nespeciallyinempiricalscience.Anotheristhattherearefallacies.\nA fallacy is an error in reasoning.24 Fallacies in the logical sense\nare not mistaken assumptions or beliefs; they are errors in\nreasoning. For fallacies in this sense to exist, people must\nsometimes make mistakes in inferring conclusions from\npremises. But on this common understanding of \u2018fallacy\u2019, there\nwill be no fallacies for the deductivist, because every argument\nthat is not deductively valid as stated is to be made deductively\nvalid by reconstruction. This result will not be welcome.25\nDeductivism makes a distorting lens through which to\nexamine the phenomena of natural argument. It recommends\ntoomuchrevisionofthedatatosavethetheory.Theproblemis\nnotthatthereexistargumentsthatcannotbereconstructedona\ndeductivistmodel.Rather,itisthatalthoughitisoftenquiteeasy\nto read into natural arguments extra premises so as to render\nthem deductively valid, the procedure of doing so is frequently\nmerely reiterative and, if not that,ad hoc.\nReconstructive deductivism allows and requires us to do too\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 41 muchtothedata.Ifwelookattheworldthroughpurpleglasses,\nit will appear purple, but little is proven by such observations.\nSimilarly, if we look at people\u2019s arguments through deductivist\nspectacles, all arguments will appear as complete or incomplete\ndeductions.Butlittlethatisrealisseenthroughthesespectacles.\nWe need some good reason as to why this is the right way to\nlook at arguments. Apart from simplicity, the only one seems\nto be the question-begging insistence that in a good argument\npremises must suffice to prove the conclusion, where by \u2018suffice\ntoprove\u2019,\u2018deductivelyentail\u2019isimplicitlymeant.Butthisviewis\ncontestable and, in the context, question-begging.\n4. Degrees of Validity?Degrees of Support?\nWe move now to another theory of argument, the spectrum\ntheory.Thistheoryisnotnearlysocommonasdeductivism.Nor\nhasityetbeenthoroughlydevelopedbyphilosophers.Itisfound\nonly in scattered statements \u2013 oral and written \u2013 by some who\nhave paid close attention to the analysis of naturally occurring\narguments.Accordingtothespectrumtheory,thestrengthofthe\nconnectionbetweenthepremisesandconclusionofanargument\nis susceptible to degrees. There are tighter and looser\nconnections. The deductive connection is the tightest, but it is\nnot the only kind. Arguments may work with looser\nconnections; the various possibilities fall on a kind of spectrum.\nA source for the spectrum theory is Stephen Thomas\u2019 text,\nPractical Reasoning in Natural Language. Like deductivists,\nThomas requires that sound arguments be valid and have true\npremises. But unlike deductivists, Thomas defines \u2018valid\u2019 in a\nbroad sense so that it applies not only to deductively valid\narguments. In the first edition of his book, Thomas speaks\nfrankly of degrees of validity. In the second edition, such\nreferences are no longer to be found. But Thomas continues his\ndeparture from deductivism by defining \u2018valid\u2019 in a way much\nbroader than \u2018deductively valid\u2019. For him, \u2018valid\u2019 serves as a kind\nof umbrella term which can embrace a whole spectrum of ways\n42TRUDYGOVIER inwhichthepremisescanbeconnectedtoaconclusion.Heputs\nthe point this way:\nValid argument: an argument in which the reasons, assuming or\nsupposing that they were true, genuinely would justify believing or\nexpecting the conclusion to be true.26\nA later passage gives further clarification and explains why\nThomasrefrainedfromusingtheexpression\u2018degreesofvalidity\u2019\nin the second edition of his text.\nThis book differs from previous logic textbooks by recognisingthat in\nnatural language, different reasons can support their conclusions with\ndifferentdegreesofsupport.Theconceptof\u2018degreeofsupport\u2019,or\u2018degree\nof strength\u2019, as it will be called also, corresponds to what some\nphilosophers call \u2018degree of confirmation\u2019, in the context of the proof\nor disproof of scientific theories.

At one end of the spectrum we have no support at\nall; at the other end, we have deductive entailment, regarded as\nfull support. Support is not an all or nothing matter. Whereas\ndeductivists would say that failure to achieve full support\nconstitutes total failure of support \u2014 that is to say, no support\nat all \u2014 this will not result from a spectrum theory. Thus, the\nseverely counterintuitive \u2018all or nothing\u2019 character of\ndeductivism is avoided. Premises that fail to entail a conclusion\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 43 may still support it \u2013 weakly, moderately, or strongly, according\nto this view.\nThomas is an appropriate source for the spectrum theory\nbecause his is a well-known and widely used text. He really\ndoes endorse the theory in the sections of the text quoted here.\nHowever,Thomas\u2019commitmenttothespectrumtheoryisinthe\nfinal analysis less than whole-hearted because he includes in his\ntext (both editions) a section on missing premises that commits\nhim todeductivism andtherebyundercutshis commitment toa\nspectrum theory.28\nThomas does not consistently maintain his spectrum theory.\nHis initial statement of the spectrum theory locates the\ndeductive connection in a paradigmatic role on the spectrum. It\nis the strongest, tightest form of support. That role may explain\nhis later desire to supplement arguments with \u2018lesser\u2019\nconnections to the point where they become deductively valid.\nHe works with an uneasy and inconsistent combination of\ndeductivism and a spectrum theory.\nAnother source for the spectrum theory is Maurice\nFinocchiaro\u2019sarticle,\u2018FallaciesandtheEvaluationofReasoning\u2019.\nIn that paper, Finocchiaro\u2019s main concern is the interpretation\nof natural argumentation. He sees a tendency among some\ninformal logicians to rely on insensitive and uncharitable\ninterpretationinordertofindfallaciesinnaturalargumentation.\nIn developing this theme, Finocchiaro briefly states a theory of\nargument:\nif a fallacy is defined as a type of common but logically incorrect\nargument, the various types would have to be the following: (1)\narguments claiming to be deductively valid but which are actually\ninvalid; (2) arguments claiming to be inductively strong but which are\nactually inductively weak; (3) arguments claiming to have some\ninductive strength but which have none. There is no way for an\nargument to be a fallacy without falling into one of the three above-\nmentioned classes.29\n44TRUDYGOVIER We may understand Finocchiaro as maintaining a spectrum\ntheory.HelocatesfewerdivisionsonhisspectrumthanThomas\ndid on his, but the basic theme is similar: there are different\ndegrees of support. Finocchiaro speaks of the connections\n\u2018claimed\u2019 in an argument, rather than speaking of the\nconnections which actually exist. This phrase poses interpretive\nproblems, since many arguers are not readily interpreted as\n\u2018claiming\u2019anydegreeofsupport.Itismerelythat,insofarasthey\nare putting forward premises in support of a conclusion, they\nare claiming support. In other words, we can interpret them\nas claiming support but not some particular degree of support.\nLanguage (at least English) does not have the vocabulary to\nreliably express claims about degrees of inferential support.\nJustasThomas\u2019theorywasstatedwithanapparentrelianceon\ndeductive connection as the tightest (best?) kind of connection,\nand is uneasily combined in his text with deductivism,\nFinocchiaro\u2019stheoryhasechoesofanotherconceptofreasoning.\nHe seems to have the inductive-deductive dichotomy in his\nmind, and to superimpose it on a spectrum by seeing \u2018weak\ninductive strength\u2019, \u2018strong inductive strength\u2019, and \u2018deductive\nvalidity\u2019 as three different degrees of the same thing.\nSeveral people with practical experience teaching students to\nanalyze naturally occurring arguments have expressed interest\nin and sympathy for some kind of spectrum theory. It is\nunfortunatethatthereseemstobenodetailedstatementofsuch\natheoryinthephilosophicalliterature.Statementsofthetheory\ncited here are brief, and echo aspects of other incompatible\ntheories.\nIt is not surprising that teachers and students of natural\nargumentationshouldfindaspectrumtheoryinitiallyattractive.\nIt strikes a convenient balance between monolithic and\npluralistic theories. Like monolithic theories, it avoids the need\nto classify arguments. Given the flexibility of language and the\nindeterminacy of arguers\u2019 intentions, this is an attractive aspect\nof the theory. However, like pluralistic theories, the spectrum\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 45 theory is able to avoid the need to impose one demanding\nstandardforgoodinferenceonallnaturalarguments.Thistoois\nadesirableresult,giventheimmensevarietywefindinnaturally\noccurringarguments.Thespectrumtheoryisflexibleandavoids\ntwo undesirable results. It does not imply that most natural\narguments are worthless. Nor does it imply that all natural\narguments have inferential merit. Fallacies will presumably be\nthose arguments which have no connection (nil, according to\nThomas) between premises and conclusion or in which the\nconnection \u2018claimed\u2019 is stronger than the connection that exists.\nThough Finocchiaro in particular is sceptical about the actual\nexistence offallacies inrealargumentation, thereisnothing ina\nspectrum theory as such which implies this result.\n4a.What\u2019s on the Spectrum?\nThe chief flaw with the spectrum theory is that it is too\nundeveloped to offer real understanding. It appears admirably\nflexible and easy to apply because of its allowance for various\ndegrees of connection, ranging on a spectrum from no\nconnection at all to a deductively valid entailment. And yet it\nis no accident that one version of the theory wandered into\ndeductivism and another is stated with strong echoes of the\npositivistic theory that all arguments are either inductive (as in\nempirical science) or deductive (as in logic and mathematics).\nThese aspects reflect the lack of theoretical underpinning for\nthe spectrum theory. The problem is that we are given no\nexplanation of what the degrees of support are degrees of. They\ncannot be degrees of deductive validity, because that notion\nmakesnosense.Deductivevalidityisallornothing.Aninference\nfromPtoQeitherisdeductivelyvalidoritisnot;thereisnosuch\nthing as making it part way.\nIf P fails to entail Q, but seems nevertheless to offer some\nreason for Q (as in \u2018the car has a good repair record according\nto Consumer Reports, so you will not have much problem with\nrepairs if you buy it\u2019), we may say P does support Q, though it\n46TRUDYGOVIER doesnotentailQ.Butsupportinthiscaseisnotaweakerversion\nof deductive support. It is not a \u2018degree\u2019 of deductive support.\nRather, it is something else.\nA closely related point is that the nature of the \u2018spectrum\u2019 on\nwhich the various degrees of support are located has yet to be\nexplained.Considerthreeargumentswhichare,onthefaceofit,\nnon-deductive in type:\nA.

Better Theories areNeeded\nWe have several nonformal theories of argument, coexisting\nalmost unnoticed with the common philosophical view that the\nvery notion of a nonformal theory of argument is absurd. And\nyet the notion of a nonformal theory of argument is not absurd.\nInteresting issues of justification and pedagogy could be\nilluminated by such a theory. The cultivation of skills in\nreasoning and critical thinking will surely require, among other\nthings, a sensitivity to the phenomena of natural argument and\na good understanding of various types of legitimate and\nillegitimateinference.Indeed,nonformaltheoriesofargument\u2013\nespeciallythethreetreatedhere\u2013areverycommonlystatedand\nappealed to by philosophers. The problem is that such theories\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 49 are merely cited. They are not articulated, developed, or\ndefended. More work is clearly needed. A fourth nonformal\ntheory of argument, called here Positivism, is discussed in the\nnext chapter.\nThis account has emphasized a single problem throughout:\ninference assessment. Traditional logic virtually restricted itself\ntothatdimensionofargumentappraisal,sothatcurrenttheories\ntend also to emphasize it. But this is not the only aspect of\nargument analysis open to theoretical scrutiny. We can see this\nevenbylookingatthemesandissuesthatarisefromthetheories\nconsideredhere.Thediscipline-specifictheory,forinstance,tells\nushowtoappraisethepremisesofarguments.Weshouldlocate\ntheargumentinadisciplineandgotothatdisciplineinorderto\ndiscover the epistemic standards that will allow us to determine\nwhether its premises are true. The deductivist theory, in its\nreconstructivist version, depends on a view of the correct way\nto interpret discourse; this dependence arises from the need for\nextensive supplementation with premises regarded as missing.\nInterpretive principles are also presumed by some theories (not\nconsidered here), that emphasize arguers\u2019 intentions as a central\nfactor in the classification of arguments. Finocchiaro\u2019s\nsuggestion thatwehavetoseewhatkindofstrengthis\u2018claimed\u2019\nrelates to these views. We have seen that common versions of\ndeductivism make the truth of premises a necessary condition\nforthesoundnessofarguments.Sometheoristshavearguedthat\nthis condition is too demanding and that the acceptability of\npremises to the audience to whom the argument is addressed\nis preferable as a condition of premise adequacy.33 The nature\nof argument as a social institution for inter-personal persuasion\nanddebate,andthebearingoffeaturesofandrelationsbetween\npersons on logical appraisal are further topics that need to be\nconsidered.\nThese issues arise from a preliminary examination of theories\nof argument primarily occupied with the traditional issue of\ninference appraisal. Topics in a full-fledged theory of argument\n50TRUDYGOVIER will extend beyond the classification of arguments as to type\nand appraisal of the correctness of the inferences on which they\ndepend and lead to broader issues of epistemology, pragmatics,\nand ethics.\nThese further topics fall broadly into two areas. One involves\nprinciples and policy having to do with the interpretation of\ndiscourse: the identification of arguments; the location of their\npremises and conclusions; the task of supplying unstated\npremisesorconclusions;charityasaprincipleofinterpretation;\nand the role of arguer\u2019s intentions and beliefs in proper\ninterpretation. The other has to do with the pragmatics and\ndialectics of argument: whether premises in a good argument\nneedbetrueoronlyacceptabletoanaudience;whetherpersonal\nattributes of arguers having to do with their authority or\ncredibilityeverhavealegitimatebearingontheirappraisalofthe\nargument;howrebuttals,prosandcons,andcounter-arguments\nare to fit within our structural models; and many related topics.\nTheroleofsuchfactorsinatheoryofargumentisalreadytacitly\nacknowledged in logical tradition because they bear upon our\nunderstanding of the traditional fallacies of begging the\nquestion,ad hominem,straw man, and appealing to authority.\nDoubtless other theories of argument could be stated. The\nwidely held belief that there are two basic kinds of argument,\ndeductive and inductive, merits treatment on its own. The\ntheories discussed here were chosen either because of their\napparent wide appeal to philosophers in general or because of\ntheir appeal to persons interested in informal logic. These\ntheories are not satisfactory: we await a better one.\nNotes\n1. John E. McPeck, Critical Thinking and Education, (Oxford:\nMartin Robertson, 1981), pp. 70- 71.\n2.

Considering the centrality of the topic and the fact that no\naccount proposed seems to solve the problems raised in this chapter,\nthis situation appears to be rather anomalous. The inductive/deductive\ndistinction is problematic but sets a great divide that has prevailed as\na framework for study and research. One might argue that standard\npractice on this matter is all right because the distinction is intuitively\nunderstandable, traditional, and so practical as to be necessary. One\nmight wish to make that case despite the problems explained here,\narising for accounts based on form; necessitation or its lack; what\nis intended or \u2018claimed\u2019 by an arguer; or the proper application of\nstandards.ButIwouldurgethattheunderlyingtheoryisnotadequate.\nI submit that the problems raised here remain real and important.\nThey were keenly explored in early editions of the Informal Logic\nNewsletter (now Informal Logic) but have not been central in more\nrecent discussions of informal logic and argumentation theory.\nIn this essay, I cite a number of examples to illustrate problems of\napplication with various versions of this distinction. These examples\nindicate that one can easily find arguments, both in colloquial and\nacademic discourse, that are hard to classify as inductive or deductive.\nReaderscanreadilytestthatclaimforthemselves,toexploretheclaims\nand considerations made here. I was especially concerned with the\n56TRUDYGOVIER dichotomous nature of logical tradition on induction and deduction.\nThe standard presumption has a positivist heritage. It was assumed\n(and, I suspect, still is) that the inductive/deductive distinction is both\nexclusive and exhaustive. That is to say, no argument is both\ninductive and deductive, and every argument is either inductive or\ndeductive. At a time when many binaries are being rejected, this\nparticular one appears to enjoy undeserved security. I argue here that\nitsstatusposesdangers,especiallyastothematterofexhaustiveness:the\nsupposition that all good reasoning is either empirical or purely logical\nservestodistortandbuttressfalsedilemmasofmethodandjustification.\nLogical positivism is widely discredited, but its implications for the\ntheory of argument continue to be sturdy survivors of their ancestor.\nPresuming exhaustiveness, one too easily ignores interesting argument\ntypes such as a priori analogy (appeals to consistency) and conductive\nor \u2018balance of consideration\u2019 arguments. Both are common within\nphilosophy itself. In past years, these arguments have received more\nattention from theorists. The question as to whether a priori analogies\nare deductive has been of some interest, and there have been many\naccounts, and many doubts expressed, concerning conductive\narguments. These types of arguments, one putatively deductive, the\nother putatively inductive, are discussed in Chapter Four.\nIt is traditional to divide arguments into two basic types:\ndeductive and inductive. The division is regarded as important,\nbecause it is thought that deductive arguments meet standards\nthat inductive arguments do not meet, and that inductive\narguments serve epistemic purposes that deductive ones cannot\nserve. The theory that there are two and only two kinds of\nargument,deductiveandinductive,maybetermedthepositivist\ntheory of argument. Where deductivism is monolithic, the\npositivist theory is dualistic. Theorists long impressed with the\nforce of deductive arguments of course noted the importance\nof empirical cumulation of data, particularly in scientific work.\nRecognizing that an entirely deductive account of everyday and\nscientific knowledge was not plausible, they departed from\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 57 deductivist rationalism to allow for a second type of argument\nbased on empirical reasoning. The tradition that arguments are\neither deductive or inductive goes back to Aristotle and was a\nprominent feature of logical positivism. It fits naturally into a\npositivist theory of knowledge within which knowledge must\ncome either from logic and mathematics (sources of deductive\narguments) or from the empirical sciences (sources of inductive\narguments).\n1. Versions of the Great Divide\nPerhaps because of this venerable tradition, there are several\nversions of the distinction between deductive arguments and\ninductive ones. For Aristotle, it was a matter of form. Deductive\narguments were syllogistic in nature; inductive ones went from\nparticular premises to universal conclusions. Aristotle\u2019s way of\nputting the distinction is no longer influential today because it\nis regarded as too narrow. A look through contemporary texts\nand monographs will produce a number of different versions\nof the \u2018inductive/deductive\u2019 distinction. These versions differ in\ntwo ways. First, they vary in how they explain the content of\nthe distinction. Second, they vary in strategy for applying it \u2013\nsome to arguments directly, some to what is \u2018claimed\u2019 for the\nconnection in an argument, some to arguers\u2019 intentions, and\nsome to the standards of appraisal for arguments, rather than\nto arguments themselves. Here we primarily consider matters\nof content. In some versions, the two blend together, as will be\napparent.\nOnsomeaccounts,deductiveargumentsarethoseinwhichthe\npremisesentailtheconclusion,therebynecessitatingthetruthof\nthe conclusion in anycase in which the premises are themselves\ntrue. Inductive arguments are those in which the premises, if\ntrue, would make it probable that the conclusion is true. Such\nan account is given in Wesley Salmon\u2019s Logic. On this view, in a\ndeductive argument:\n58TRUDYGOVIER 1. ifallthepremisesaretrue,theconclusionmustalsobetrue,\nand\n2. all the information in the conclusion is already contained \u2013\nat least implicitly \u2013 in the premises.\nwhereas in an inductive argument,\n1. if all the premises are true the conclusion is probably true,\nbut not necessarily true.\nand\n2. the conclusion contains information not implicitly in the\npremises.1\nOn this version of the distinction, we have a dichotomy of\ngoodarguments.Badargumentswouldfailtobeeitherdeductive\nor inductive, based on these definitions. If an argument has\npremises that are irrelevant to the conclusion, or contains an\nerror in deductive reasoning, it will fall in neither category.\nAsimilaraccountisofferedinRobertNeidorf\u2019stext,Deductive\nForms, where the inductive/deductive distinction is stated as\nfollows:\nIn an inductive argument, the conclusion probably follows from the\npremises. In a deductive argument, it certainly follows. An argument\nwhich fails as deductive may nevertheless constitute a good inductive\nargument.2\nHenry Kyburg\u2019s distinction in Probability and Inductive Logic is\nessentially similar: the distinction is given in terms of success\nand bad arguments fall into neither category.3 The account\nappears to be exhaustive, not for all arguments but for all good\narguments. Bad arguments are in limbo.\nAnother way of drawing the inductive-deductive distinction\nputs all the bad arguments in the inductive category. On this\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 59 view,deductiveargumentsarethoseinwhichthepremisesentail\ntheconclusion.Inductiveargumentsarealltherest.Thisversion\nmay be adopted for the express purpose of guaranteeing\nexhaustiveness. Often this intent is made obvious by the\nreplacementof\u2018inductive\u2019by\u2018nondeductive\u2019,\u2018nondemonstrative\u2019,\nor \u2018nonconclusive\u2019. This is the version which Nicholas Rescher\nmust have had in mind when he said: \u2018an inductive argument is\nsimply an argument whose conclusion outruns the information\nprovided by its premises.\u20194 The scheme was also adopted by\nBaruch Brody in his text on theoretical and applied logic. Brody\ndefined validity, and discussed deductive arguments and\ndeductive validity. Then, potentially in a departure from the\npositivist theory, he allowed that arguments which fail to be\ndeductively valid are nevertheless sometimes \u2018perfectly\nacceptable\u2019 in some other way.5\nWith this approach the category of inductive arguments will\nbe large indeed. It will include all poor arguments, as well as\na motley variety of good arguments. All deductive arguments\nwill be valid by definition. (That is to say, there will be no such\nthing as an invalid deductive argument.) Inductive arguments\nwillincludethoseinwhichthepremises,iftrue,wouldmakethe\nconclusionprobable;thoseinwhichthepremisesarecompletely\nirrelevant to the conclusion; all formal and informal fallacies;\nanalogies; inferences to the best explanation; so-called \u2018good\nreasons\u2019 arguments; and potentially many others. Thus the\n\u2018inductive\u2019 category will explicitly serve as a leftover category.\nThiswayofdrawingthedistinctionwillguarantee,bydefinition,\nan exhaustive and exclusive dichotomy. The result that there\nare no invalid deductive arguments will be unsettling to many\ntraditionalists, however, and the inductive category will exhibit\nlittle coherence.\nOn a third view, deductive arguments are those in which it\nis claimed that the premises entail or necessitate the conclusion.\nInductive arguments are those in which it is claimed that the\npremises make the conclusion likely or probable. This kind of\n60TRUDYGOVIER account is suggested in Max Black\u2019s Encyclopedia of Philosophy\narticle on induction. Black says:\nThe name \u2018induction\u2019, derived from the Latin translation of Aristotle\u2019s\nepagoge, will be used here to cover all cases of nondemonstrative\nargumentinwhichthetruthofthepremises,whilenotentailingthetruth\nof the conclusion purports to be a good reason for belief in it.6\nThe most important sources for this version of the inductive/\ndeductivedistinctionareIrvingCopi\u2019sclassictexts.Inthefourth\nedition ofIntroduction to Logic,Copi put it this way:\nAccordingly, we characterize a deductive argument as one whose\nconclusionisclaimedtofollowfromitspremiseswithabsolutenecessity,\nthis necessity not being a matter of degree and not depending in any\nway upon whatever else may be the case. And in sharp contrast we\ncharacterize an inductive argument as one whose conclusion is claimed\ntofollowfromitspremisesonlywithprobability,thisprobabilitybeinga\nmatter of degree and dependentupon what else may be the case.7\nThisversionoftheinductive-deductivedistinctionmaybethe\nmost standard one. It allows for the commonsensical result that\nthere are both valid and invalid deductive arguments and both\nstrong and weak inductive arguments.\nThe problems with this account begin with the expression \u2018is\nclaimed to\u2018. When people present arguments, it is often unclear\nwhether logical entailment or merely some less tight support\nis \u2018claimed\u2018. Their words often do not suggest one or the other.\nFurthermore,theexpression\u201cisclaimed\u201disambiguous.Onemay\nmean by it that the arguer intends one or the other connection\nor one may mean that the wording, context, and nature of the\nargument themselves suggest either a deductive or an inductive\ngoal.SinceCopiandotherswhofollowhimhavenotmadetheir\ndistinction explicitly intentional, it seems best to follow the\ndirection of the second interpretation of \u2018is claimed\u2019 here.8 To\nseewhatconnectionisclaimedinanargument,wehavetostudy\nthe nature of that argument itself: the stated premises and\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 61 conclusion, the context, the indicator words, qualifying or\nhedging words such as \u2018probably\u2019 or \u2018in all likelihood\u2019, and the\nlogical relationships that exist between the premises and the\nconclusion. These are in the argument, not in the intentions\nand beliefs of the arguer. Given the inscrutability of arguers\u2019\nintentions, especially when they are distant or dead, this seems\na more promising direction. However, it is not without its\ndifficulties.\nTo see how problems can arise when we try to apply Copi\u2019s\nversion of the inductive-deductive distinction, we can consider\nseveral examples from his own exercises. Here is an argument\nwhichCopitakesfromEtienneGilson\u2019sTheUnityofPhilosophical\nExperience.Since man is essentially rational, the constant recurrence\nof metaphysics in the history of human knowledge must have its\nexplanation in the very structure of reason itself.9\nThe argument here is:\n1. Man is essentially rational.\nTherefore,\n2. The constant recurrence of metaphysics in the history of\nhumans has its explanation in the very structure of reason\nitself.\nOnecouldsaythattheword\u2018must\u2019providesreasontotakethe\nargumentasdeductive.Itseemstobefunctioningasaninference\nindicator rather than as a modal term within the conclusion\nclaim. However, the word \u2018must\u2019 has empirical inference uses\ntoo, as in \u2018you must be tired after all that hiking yesterday\u2019. One\nmight, alternatively, think that since Gilson is dealing with an\nexplanation for the recurrence of metaphysics, he is\nhypothesizing, and that his argument should be taken as\ninductive, a kind of \u2018best explanation\u2019 appeal. It will hardly do\nto say that since Gilson is a philosopher and writing as a\n62TRUDYGOVIER philosopher, the argument must be deductive. The case is not\neasily classified using Copi\u2019s distinction.\nAnother perplexing case is the following, which Copi quotes\nfrom Adam Smith.\nA gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands unites\ninhisownpersonthethreedifferentcharactersoflandlord,farmer,and\nlaborer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first, the\nprofit of the second, and the wages of the third.10\nCopiclassifies thisargument asdeductiveonthegroundsthat\nitdoesnotappealtoexperiencetoestablishwhatisprobablythe\ncase, but appeals to principles of equity to prove what should be\nthe case. (This appeal must be a tacit one.) Principles of equity\narepresumedherenottocomefromexperience,whichhasbeen\nclassically associated with induction. Now, there was no\nreference to experience in Copi\u2019s definition of induction and it\nis that notion which has been omitted from modern accounts,\npresumably in the interests of obtaining an exhaustive\ndichotomybetweendeductionandinduction.Whatshouldbeat\nissue, strictly, within Copi\u2019s account, is whether conclusiveness\nis \u2018claimed\u2019 in the argument. The matter of principles of equity\nhas no bearing on this issue: we might appeal to them hesitantly\nor assuredly; one might cite them to deduce a conclusion about\naparticularcase,ortohypothesis.WecanofcoursemakeAdam\nSmith\u2019s argument deductively valid by adding three premises:\n1. If aperson serves the role ofafarmer,he should receivethe\nprofit of a farmer.\n2. If a person serves the role of a landlord, he should receive\nthe rent of a landlord.\n3. Ifapersonservestheroleofalaborer,heshouldreceivethe\nwages of a laborer.\nBut the fact that the argument can be supplemented so as\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 63 to be deductively valid does not show what is \u2018claimed\u2019 when\nit is unsupplemented. As we have seen, any argument can be\nsupplemented so as to become deductively valid. If that were\nsufficienttomakeit\u2018claim\u2019deductivevalidity,Copi\u2019sviewwould\namount to deductivism. Clearly, that is not his intent, since he\nseeks to explain a distinction between deductive and inductive\narguments.\nThese difficulties do not arise just because Copi has selected\nunfortunate examples. The problem is that the inductive/\ndeductive distinction as Copi draws it is difficult to apply to\nreal arguments. Everything depends on what is claimed in the\nargument about the tightness of the connection between\npremises and conclusion. This interpretation must somehow be\ninferred from the wording and the context. But indicators may\ngo in different directions or fail to be present at all. Neither\ncontexts,norindicatorwords,northelogicalorderingofclaims,\nnorthenatureofthesubjectprovidefirmguidanceastowhatan\nargument\u2018claims\u2019abouttheconnectionbetweenitspremisesand\nits conclusion.\nSome years back, readers of the Informal Logic Newsletter were\ntreated to a series of critical articles on the viability of the\ninductive- deductive distinction. Perturbed by the difficulty in\napplying the distinction to naturally occurring arguments,\nseveral writers defended versions of the positivist theory that\nwould transfer the inductive-deductive dichotomy into another\ndomain. Difficulties in applying various versions of the\ndistinction to arguments directly generated suggestions that the\ndistinction must apply elsewhere. One suggestion, put forward\nby Samuel Fohr, was that the inductive-deductive distinction\ndid not apply to arguments themselves but rather to arguers\u2019\nintentions and thereby (derivatively) to arguments as put forward\nbyparticulararguers.Anothersuggestionwasthatitappliedtothe\nstandards by which arguments could be assessed.\nFohr maintained that arguments were not merely sets of\nstatements to be found in textbooks, but rather claims made\n64TRUDYGOVIER by persons seeking to justify further claims. On this notion of\nargument, Smith and Jones might make the same claims, using\nthesamewords,butofferdifferentarguments,iftheirintentions\nwere relevantly different. An explicitly intentional account had\nbeen offered earlier by Robert Olson in his text, Meaning and\nArgument.Olson said:\nThe term \u2018imply\u2019 has a stronger and weaker meaning. In its stronger\nmeaning,thepremisesofanargument\u2018imply\u2019aconclusionifandonlyif\ntheygiveconclusive evidence forit.Initsweaker meaning thepremises\nof an argument \u2018imply\u2019 a conclusion if and only if they give reasonably\ngoodbutlessthanconclusiveevidenceinitsfavor.Ifthearguerbelieves\nthat the premises of an argument necessarily imply the conclusion, the\nargument is deductive (or necessary). If the arguer believes that the\npremisesofanargumentprobablyimplytheconclusiontheargumentis\nnondeductive (or probable).11\nFohr endorsed Olson\u2019s account, and put his own distinction this\nway:\nIf a person intends that his premises necessitate his conclusion, he is\ngivingadeductiveargument.Ifheintendsonlythathispremisesrender\nhis conclusion probable, he is giving an inductive argument.12\nWe see a shift here from beliefs to intentions. As Fohr was\nforced to admit, this version of the distinction makes it non-\nexhaustive. There are many cases in which those who compose\narguments intend only that their premises provide support for\ntheir conclusion and fail to have any intention regarding\nnecessitation or making probable. The concept of logical\nnecessitation is a philosopher\u2019s concept that is difficult to teach\nto students, and that we cannot expect the bulk of ordinary\npeople to contemplate regularly in their day-to-day lives, even\nwhenever they are offering reasons. Many arguments will fall\ninto limbo so far as this statement of the positivist theory is\nconcerned. As one critic pointed out, the man who tells his wife\nthatsheshouldhelphimpaintthekitchenbecauseshepromised\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 65 to do so is likely to have little idea as to whether he intends to\nprove his conclusion or merely make it probable. He wants her\nto help with the painting, and he\u2019s telling her why she should\ndo it. In response, Fohr urged that such arguments be assessed\naccording to both kinds of standards (those appropriate for\ninduction and those appropriate for deduction) and maintained\nthat ordinary arguers should have the required intentions\nregarding their premises and conclusions.\nFohr\u2019s approach would make the philosophical distinction\nbetween necessitating and making probable a norm for\nargumentative intentions. If arguers do not grasp this norm, we\nhave to consider their arguments from both perspectives.\nHowever, these arguers should brush up on epistemology and\norder their intentions to fit our theory of argument.\nAnother proposal regarding application was stated by Brian\nSkyrms in Choice and Chance and defended in the Newsletter\ninterchange by David Hitchcock. It moves the dichotomy from\narguments to standards of appraisal.\nSkyrms criticizes the intentionalist account in a footnote,\nsaying:\n.. this will not do, for arguments do not intend anything. People who\nadvance arguments intend many things. Sometimes they intend for the\nargument to be deductively valid; sometimes they intend it to be\ninductivelystrong;sometimestheyintendittobeacleversophistry;and\nsometimes they don\u2019t know the difference.13\nThe positivist theory of argument, on this version, would say\nthat there are many diverse arguments \u2013 some hard to classify \u2013\nbut that there are, broadly speaking, only two types of standards\nfor appraising arguments. These are deductive standards and\ninductive standards. On this account, the distinction between\ninductive and deductive is not a distinction between types of\nargument. Nor is it a distinction between types of intention\narguers might have. Rather, it is a distinction between types of\nstandard that may be used for appraising arguments. There are\n66TRUDYGOVIER two broad types of standard: deductive standards and inductive\nstandards. Deductive standards are used when we wish to\ndetermine whether the premises of an argument entail its\nconclusion. Inductive standards are used when we wish to\ndetermine whether the premises of an argument make its\nconclusion probable. Skyrms put it this way:\nWe defined logic as the study of the strength of the evidential link\nbetween the premises and conclusions of arguments. We have seen that\ntherearetwodifferentstandardsagainstwhichtoevaluatethestrength\nof this link: deductive validity and inductive strength. Corresponding\nto these two standards are two branches of logic: deductive logic and\ninductive logic. Deductive logic is concerned with tests for deductive\nvalidity \u2013 that is, rules for deciding whether or not a given argument\nis deductively valid \u2013 and rules for constructing deductively valid\narguments. Inductive logic is concerned with tests for measuring the\ninductive probability, and hence the inductive strength, of arguments\nand with rules for constructing inductively strong arguments.\nDavid Hitchcock defended Skyrms\u2019 view, saying that the\ninductive/deductive distinction provides an exhaustive\ndichotomy of standards of appraisal, rather than an exhaustive\ndichotomy of types of argument. Hitchcock said that in\ndeductive logic, we are offered a theory of the circumstances in\nwhich premises do or do not make it logically impossible for\na conclusion to be false given the premises. In inductive logic,\nwe have a theory of the circumstances in which an argument is\ninductively strong or inductively weak \u2013 that is, in which it is\nmore or less probable that its conclusion is true, given that its\npremise(s) are true. Within each theory there are various types\nof logic. In deductive logic we have the logic of truth-functional\nsentenceconnectives,first-orderquantifiers,thelogicofidentity\nand so on. Within inductive logic we have the logic of the\nconfirmation and disconfirmation of hypotheses, the logic of\nanalogical arguments, the logic of inferences from sample\ncharacteristics to population characteristics, the logic of\ncontrolled experiments to prove causal claims, and so on. Then\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 67 there is the logic of conductive or balance of considerations or\ngood reasons arguments. Possibly there are other standards.14\nBothSkyrmsandHitchcockarguethatitisnotalwayseasyto\ndecide which sort of standardtoapplytoa particular argument.\nFor this reason, they believe that it makes more sense to think\nof a dichotomy of standards rather than a dichotomy of arguments.\nThere are two puzzling aspects of this view, however. First, we\nmayquestionwhywehaveadichotomyofstandards,ratherthan\na plurality. This question will certainly strike forcefully if we\nlook at Hitchcock\u2019s list for the inductive standards. It is hard\nto see what analogy, balance-of-considerations reasoning, and\nthe use of controlled experiments to justify causal conclusions\nwill have in common. One suspects that they have been lumped\ntogether, seen as involving a common inductive standard\n(whatever that might be) precisely in the interests of getting an\nexhaustive dichotomy. The account is slightly anomalous, as\nHitchcock acknowledged in reply to critics, because one would\npresume a connection between the articulation of standards for\nappraising theinferences within arguments andtheexistence of\narguments to which those standards are appropriately applied.\nThe former should presuppose the latter. The view can be\namendedtoincorporatethispointifonesaysthatstandardsexist\nand there are arguments to which it is clearly appropriate to\napplythosestandards.Butatthatpointtheissuewillbewhether\nstandards fall broadly into just two types: deductive and\ninductive.15 Again, the great divide can be questioned. It is\nreasonable to suppose that we develop standards of one kind\nor another because there is a substantial group of arguments to\nwhich they are appropriately applied.\nAmong philosophers, the positivist theory of argument seems\nto be the most popular theory. It is Copi\u2019s version which is the\nmost commonly accepted, perhaps due to the influence of his\ntexts over several decades. It is also because this view and it\nalone allows one to apply the inductive-deductive distinction\nto all arguments and to have good and poor arguments within\n68TRUDYGOVIER each category. Salmon, Neidorf, and Kyburg give a version of\nthe distinction applicable only to good arguments. Black and\nRescherstateonewhichallowsinductiveargumentstobeeither\ngoodorpoor,butleavesalldeductiveonesasvalid.Fohrtransfer\nthe distinction to intentions, with the result that it cannot be\nexhaustive after all.\nMost who rely on a positivist theory of argument have not\narticulatedaparticularversion,forithasbeen\u2018commonwisdom\u2019\namongst logicians and philosophers. They would hold that the\ntheoryisexhaustive,thatitappliestoarguments(asdistinctfrom\nintentions or standards) and that it allows for good and poor\narguments (inferentially speaking) within each category. These\npresumptions make Copi\u2019s account the most attractive one.\nAs we have seen, significant problems arise in applying Copi\u2019s\ndistinction, due mostly to the phrase \u2018is claimed to\u2019 in the\ndefinition. This phrase does not make explicit reference to the\nintentions of arguers. A person might use words that, as\nnormally understood, make a claim she did not actually intend\ntomake.TheCopiversionoftheinductive/deductivedistinction\ndoes not commit us to the tight relationship between the\nintentions of the arguer and the direction and force of the\nargument. Rather, it requires that we look at the wording of the\nargument and try to determine whether the argument as stated\nis claiming a necessary or probabilistic connection between the\npremises and the conclusion. The difficulty at this point is that\nindicators may give conflicting signals, or be absent altogether.\nHencewearefrequentlyleftnotknowingwhethertoclassifyan\nargument as deductive or as inductive. We saw problems even\nwith examples that Copi himself selected for exercises. Here is\nanother:\nThe peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is\nrobbing the human race: posterity as well as the existing generation;\nthose who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it. If\ntheopinionisright,theyaredeprivedoftheopportunityofexchanging\nerror for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit,\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 69 the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its\ncollision with error.16\nInthisargumentofJ.S.Mill\u2019swemayaskwhether\u2018itisclaimed\u2019\nthat the conclusion follows with absolute necessity from the\npremises. The conclusion is that suppressing the expression of\nanopinionalwaysrobsthehumanraceespecially\u2018posterity\u2019and\ndissenters. It is quite clear what this conclusion is, and it is also\nfairly clear as to what premises are stated in defence of it.\n(Interpreters may dispute as to whether the argument contains\nunstated premises. But for now it is only the classification of\nthe argument as inductive or deductive on the basis of what\n\u2018is claimed\u2019 that is at issue.) There seems to be no conclusive\nevidence as to how tightly the conclusion \u2018is claimed\u2019 to be\nrelated to those premises. One might regard the argument as\ndeductive or as inductive.\nNor is this example unrepresentative. As Skyrms, teachers of\ninformal logic, and a number of writers on the inductive-\ndeductive distinction have noted to their consternation,\nexamples like this are all too easy to find. Consider again:\nIt is the singular feature of such ethnic explanation (of poverty) that\nit is all but exclusively confined to conversation. The reputable scholar\nunhesitantlyadvertstoitincasualinterchangebutrarelyifeverputsit\ninhisbooksorevenhislectures.Whatiswhollyplausibleinconversation\niswhollyimpermissibleinprint.Thereisobviouslysomethingoddabout\nan explanation of poverty and well-being that must be so discreetly\nhandled.\nHereJohn Kenneth Galbraith, in adiscussion ofmass poverty,\nargues from the absence of ethnic explanations of poverty in\nprint and in lectures to the \u2018oddity\u2019 of these explanations of\npoverty.17 It is clear what his conclusion and premises are, but\nunclear what \u2018is claimed\u2019 about the relation between them. The\nword\u2018obviously\u2019indicatesthatGalbraithconfidentlybelieveshis\nconclusion to be true, but does not indicate whether he believes\nit to be necessitated, or rather made probable, by his premises.\n70TRUDYGOVIER It is no accident that such examples are easy to find. People\nwho argue do (at least implicitly) distinguish conclusions from\npremises and \u2018claim\u2019 that the latter provide reasons for the\nformer.Buttheyoftendonot,evenimplicitly,makeclaimsabout\nwhat sort of connection is supposed to hold between these\npremises and their conclusion. A major reason for this is that\nmost arguers have not reflected on the difference between\ndeductiveentailmentandmakingprobable,andhencewouldnot\nraise the question about strength of connection as philosophers\nwould like them to raise it. They do not, explicitly or implicitly,\n\u2018make claims\u2019 about an issue that for them does not arise at all.\nA further problem is that even if ordinary arguers did wish to\nindicatewhetheranecessaryorprobableconnectionexisted,our\nlanguage provides very few words which would conveniently\nserve the purpose. (At least, that is true of English.) Indicators\nsuch as \u2018therefore\u2019 and \u2018must\u2019 are sometimes urged by textbook\nauthorstoindicatedeductivearguments,butarealsotobefound\nin arguments that tradition would label as non deductive. Given\nthat the notion of deductive entailment and the related notion\nof \u2018following with absolute necessity\u2019, which Copi uses in his\ndefinition, are philosophical constructs, it is not surprising that\nordinary language lacks terms that reliably indicate a claim to\neither sort of connection.\nThose who continue to believe that ordinary arguers would\ndo well to master this distinction and learn to observe it should\nrecall that the closely related distinctions of analytic versus\nsynthetic statements, and of necessary versus contingent\nstatements, are contested. It is a commonplace of modern\nphilosophy that these distinctions are difficult to draw with\nprecision. Since Quine\u2019s \u2018Two Dogmas of Empiricism\u2019 and\nWaismann\u2019s \u2018Analytic-Synthetic\u2019 series, few philosophers have\nused these distinctions with confidence. Current analyses of\nscientific reasoning emphasize thedifficultyofclassifying terms\nas either conceptual or observational and the related difficulty\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 71 in classifying statements as either logical or empirical. Given\nsuch acknowledged difficulties, it is a tribute to the sheer force\nof unanalyzed tradition that the inductive-deductive distinction\nhasremainedsoprominentasthebasisforatheoryofargument.\nDepending on which version of the positivist theory we are\ndealingwith,weneedtofindoutwhetheralltheinformation\u2018in\u2019\nthe conclusion is already \u2018in\u2019 the premises; whether the truth of\nthe premises would make the falsity of the conclusion \u2018logically\nimpossible\u2019; whether the argument or the arguer \u2018claims\u2019 or\n\u2018intends\u2019 either of these; and so on. If there are many borderline\ncases when we try to determine whether statements are analytic\norsynthetic(ornecessaryorcontingent,oraprioriorempirical),\nthere will obviously be borderline cases for arguments as well.\nThe question for arguments can be collapsed into the other: we\nask whether the associated conditional is empirical or necessary\ninstead of asking whether the argument is deductive or\ninductive. If the argument is deductively valid, its associated\nconditional is necessarily true. If it \u2018claims\u2019 deductive validity,\nit \u2018claims\u2019 that the associated conditional is necessarily true. If\nits author intends it to be deductively valid, he intends that its\nassociated conditional is necessarily true, and so on.\nTo illustrate this point, consider the following argument from\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s early book, The Copernican Revolution. Early in\nhis career, Kuhn felt an obligation to defend what was then an\nunusual practice \u2013 combining the history of science with the\nphilosophy of science. He said:\n.. the combination of science and intellectual history is an unusual one.\nInitially it may therefore seem incongruous. But there can be no intrinsic\nincongruity. Scientific concepts are ideas and as such they are the subject\nof intellectual history.18\nThere is a subargument structure here:\n1. Scientific concepts are ideas.\n72TRUDYGOVIER So,\n2. Scientific concepts are the subject of intellectual history.\nTherefore,\n3. Thereisnothingintrinsicallyincongruousaboutcombining\nscience and intellectual history.\nAskingwhetherthisargumentisdeductivelyvalidis,ineffect,\nasking whether its two associated conditionals are logically\nnecessary. These are \u2018If scientific concepts are ideas, then\nscientific concepts are the subject of intellectual history\u2019 and \u2018If\nscientific concepts are the subject of intellectual history, then\nthere is nothing incongruous about combining science and\nintellectualhistory\u2019.Arethesestatementslogically,ornecessarily\ntrue? It is not clear in either case. The first might be said to\nassume that all ideas are the subject of intellectual history, and\nthus not to be necessarily true as stated, on the grounds that it\nassumes something false. On the other hand, it might be said to\nassume onlythatscientific ideasareserious ideasandallserious\nideas are the subject of intellectual history, and the claim might\nbe made that these assumed statements are true, perhaps even\nnecessarily true. The matter is arguable. Nor are standards of\nincongruousness precise. It is by no means easy to work out\nan answer to the question of whether the second conditional\nis necessarily true. Probably the most cautious answer is to say\nthat neither conditional is necessarily true. We can see from\nthis example just how directly difficulties with the necessary/\ncontingent and analytic/synthetic distinctions transfer to the\ninductive/deductivedistinction.IfweaskwhetherKuhnintended\neither or both conditionals to be interpreted so as to come out\nas necessarily true, or claimed implicitly that either or both were\nnecessarily true, the problem would not be more easily resolved.\nTo add to these difficulties, there are further problems that\nappear when we consider the possibility that arguments have\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 73 unstatedpremises.Asthetopicofmissingpremisesisalargeand\nthorny one for any theory of argument, we cannot pose it as a\nspecial problem for the positivist theory. However, it augments\ndifficulties of classification because, as we have seen, any\nargument can be reconstructed as a deductively valid argument\nby suitable addition of premises.19 Perry Weddle, among others,\nonce urged that such possibilities for reconstruction leave too\nmuch indeterminacy in classification. He urged a shift to a\nmonolithictheoryasaresult.Onemighturgethatifanargument\ncan be reconstructed so as to be deductively valid, this in itself\nmay be seen as a reason to think that the arguer must, in effect,\nhave \u2018claimed\u2019 that his premises (stated and understood or\nunstated) would lead with absolute necessity to his conclusion.\nSome who believe that such reconstructions more accurately\ndepict the direction and force of the original argument will see\nthe emerging \u2018fact\u2019 that the reconstructed argument is\ndeductivelyvalidtobeareasonforthinkingthearguer\u2018claimed\u2019\nan absolutely necessary connection. But it is not a good reason.\nIt is not easy to sort actual arguments into the two positivist\ncategories on the basis of the Copi sort of account which\nconstitutes standard logical wisdom on the part of many\nphilosophers today. That many difficulties arise in applying the\ndistinction cannot be denied. What is debatable is not the\nexistence, but the significance, of these difficulties. The\ndistinction between A\u2019s and B\u2019s may be important even though\nthere are many items that are borderline cases and might be\nclassified either as A\u2019s or as B\u2019s. Yet one must acknowledge that\napplication problems do not by themselves show that a\ndistinction is untenable. It is likely that the classifying problems\nthat plague the positivist theory of argument have their\ncounterpartsinotherpluralistictheoriesofargument.Wemight\nhave to choose between a theory with classifying problems and\na monolithic theory. That theory would presumably be\ndeductivism, given that no one doubts that there exist at least\nsome arguments that are deductively valid.\n74TRUDYGOVIER There are almost always several ways of interpreting what\npeople say and write. This point applies to arguments as it does\nto all other discourse. Any theory of argument allowing for\nseveralcategoriesofargumentwillhavetomakesomeallowance\nforthisflexibilityininterpretation.Thosewhoadoptthetheory\nwill have to develop a policy for borderline cases. The fact that\nthere are many cases that are not easily classified according to\nthe positivist theory does not count conclusively against that\ntheory. If one is convinced that the basic dualism of the theory\nis built around something fundamental and important, one may\nattribute the many borderline cases to variations in context, the\nflexibility of written and spoken language, and the problem of\nmissing premises, and decide to maintain some version of the\ntheory.\nThe key issue is the nature of this basic dualism. The term\n\u2018positivist\u2019 is appropriate for the theory of the great divide\nbecausethatdivideowesmuchofitsdominationofourthought\nto the belief, common some decades back, that mathematics-\nlogic and the empirical sciences are the only two sources of\nhuman knowledge. The different versions of positivism are all\ndualistic, though the dualism appears in different places in the\nvarious versions. The key common idea is that there is a basic\nkind of connection between premises and conclusion that is\ndeductive, and there is one other kind of connection. Only one.\nThe deductive side of the dichotomy seems relatively\nunproblematic. To be satisfied with the positivist theory,\nhowever, we have to be satisfied with both sides. Moreover, and\nmost significantly, one has to convince oneself that this\ndichotomy is exhaustive. The key issue for any version of the\npositivist theory, is whether there is just one kind of\nnondeductive connection.\nThe usual way of describing an inductive connection between\npremisesandconclusionistosaythatthepremises,iftrue,make\nthe truth of the conclusion likely or probable. This may be a\nway of saying only that the premises have some bearing on the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 75 conclusion but fail to entail it. If so, no independent\nunderstandingofinductiveconnectionisgained.Onehassimply,\nin effect, reiterated one\u2019s belief that deductive connection is an\nimportant thing to understand and negatively defined a second\nderivative category. To have a good understanding of the\ndichotomy around which the positivist theory of argument is\nbuilt,oneshouldhaveanindependentandclearunderstandingof\ninductiveconnection.Ifthetheoryistodichotomizearguments,\nthis understanding should yield a distinction that will be\nrelativelyeasytoapplyandthatwillexclusivelyandexhaustively\ndivide arguments into the two types.\nThe term \u2018probable\u2019, which is often used in defining inductive\narguments, is most naturally applied to contexts where we are\nexpressing roughly quantifiable degrees of confidence in\nempiricalstatementandwherewearewilling,inatleastarough\nsense, to make quantitative judgments. Probability theories deal\nwith the quantitative assessment of confidence or likelihood of\nsomeempiricalstatements,givenapriorquantitativeassessment\nof others, based in the final analysis on relative frequencies. If\none is to use \u2018probable\u2019 or a related term in order to specify a\nsenseof\u2018inductive\u2019whichwillprovideafirmbasisforaclearand\nexhaustive \u2018inductive/deductive\u2019 distinction, one need to define\nthe term more broadly. There are many arguments that have\nconclusions that are non-empirical and in which, nevertheless,\nthesupportingreasoningis,onthefaceofit,notdeductive.(They\nappear to be a priori and yet not deductive.) In such contexts, a\nstandard conception of probability is a poor fit.\nConsider arguments of the following types:\n\u2022 consistency arguments by analogy. In such arguments it is\nurged that case (a) is relevantly similar to case (b); that case (b)\nhas been treated as such-and-such; and that therefore case (a)\nshould be similarly treated. The conclusion is normative; the\nreasoning is based on parallel cases.\n\u2022 arguments of the type that Carl Wellman has called\n76TRUDYGOVIER \u2018conductive\u2019 and which others have referred to as \u2018balance-of-\nconsideration\u2019 or \u2018good reasons\u2019 arguments (Baier) or as\n\u2018convergent arguments\u2019 (Thomas). In such arguments, several\nreasons are cited; these appear to bear independently on the\nconclusion. All premises may be relevant; none taken alone is\nlikely to be sufficient. Frequently the conclusion is normative;\nit may also be about an issue of classification or\ninterpretation.\n\u2022 non-conclusive philosophical arguments. These may be of one\nof the above types. They are noted separately here in the hope\nthat philosophers will be particularly familiar with the idea\nthat in their own discipline there are often arguments that\nseem to have some force, yet not to be deductively valid. (For\nexample, the failure of many physicalistic terms to apply\nnaturally to such phenomena as belief and thoughtcounts\nagainstthe mind-brain identity thesis, but how seriously? It\ndoes give a reason to think there may be something wrong, or\noverly-simple, about the thesis. But it does notentailits\nfalsehood. Nor would it be natural to say that this linguistic\nfact makes it \u2018improbable\u2019 that the identity thesis is true. The\nnotion of probability does not fit the case well. And obviously,\nthe truth or falsity of the thesis is not straightforwardly\nempirical.)\np class=\u201dimport-Normal indent\u201d style=\u201dmargin-left: 0.7pt;\nmargin-right:0.5pt;text-indent:10.05pt;\u201d>Therearetwothemes\nunderlying the idea that an inductive connection is probabilistic\nratherthannecessary.Thefirstisanegativeidea:thepremisesdo\nnot necessitate the conclusion.

I\nsubmit that it is not very helpful.\nAppeals in this context to the term \u2018probable\u2019 are not useful\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 77 outside contexts where the conclusion is empirical. The reasons\nwe offer for and against normative and conceptual conclusions\nare not naturally understood as making these more or less\nprobable. For example, an argument in which abortion is\nassimilated to infanticide is not one in which the premises, if\ntrue, make it probable, or more probable, that abortion is wrong.\nThey provide some reason to think that abortion is wrong. It\nmakes little sense to attach probabilities to normative\nconclusions of this type.20\nIf a probabilistic connection is any connection other than a\ndeductive one, then of course consistency arguments,\nconductive arguments, and many philosophical arguments are\nbased on such a connection. If that connection is allowed to\ndefinewhataninductiveconnectionis,theinferenceinquestion\nmay be said to be inductive. But little understanding is thereby\ngained.\nOne may understand probabilistic connection in this broad\nway. But no information is thereby provided as to what the\nvarious inductive arguments have in common. It will not\nelucidate the category \u2018inductive\u2019 so as to yield a balanced\ndualism in the positivist theory of argument. On this\nunderstanding, one has deductive arguments (in which an\nentailmentofconclusionbypremisesisexemplified,intended,or\n\u2018claimed\u2019) and one has other arguments (in which no entailment\nisexemplified,intended,or\u2018claimed\u2019).Theinductiveisthe\u2018other\u2019,\nabout which one has said nothing informative. The broad\nunderstanding of probabilistic connection is misleading insofar\nas concepts of probability are most commonly associated with,\nand most straightforwardly applicable to, the confirmation of\nempirical statements by empirical evidence. This association,\ntogether with the more fundamental association between\ninduction and scientific reasoning, has led many to ignore the\nfactthatreasoningthatisprobabilisticinthebroadsenseisoften\nnot probabilistic in the narrower sense. Non-empirical\nconclusions maybedefended byreasoning thatisnondeductive\n78TRUDYGOVIER in the sense that it does not exemplify (or is not intended or\nclaimed to exemplify) the connection of logical entailment of\nconclusion by premises. The shifting between a broad and a\nnarrower sense of \u2018probable\u2019 and related terms makes it too easy\nto ignore the existence of nondeductive arguments that are\nprimarily non-empirical in character.\nIn light of these considerations, the basic dualism underlying\nthe positivist theory of argument is not sufficiently clear and\ncompelling to outweigh classificatory problems. Though this is\nprobably the theory of argument most popular among\nphilosophers, and it has a venerable history going back through\nHume even to Aristotle, I contend that it is not a satisfactory\ntheory.\nThestrongphilosophicalattachmenttothepositivisttheoryof\nargumentmaybeduetotwobeliefs,bothprominentintradition\nandbothhavingafirmholdonmany.Thereisfirstthetradition\ngoing back to Aristotle, which maintains that there are two and\nonly two broad types of argument: deductive arguments, which\nare conclusive, and inductive arguments, which are not. There\nis secondly the tradition \u2013 with the same venerable history \u2013\nthat inductive arguments are the arguments of science:\nfundamentally induction deals with the empirical confirmation\nof scientific hypotheses. The problem is not with either of these\ntraditional beliefs but with their conjunction. If one is loyal to\nboth at once, one is led to ignore many arguments common in\nmorality, history, literary interpretation, law, and philosophy.\nTherearemanyissuesthatareneitheramenabletotechniques\nof empirical confirmation (not straightforwardly, in any case)\nnor settled deductively. Inductive logics have dealt primarily\nwith arguments that are classically inductive (enumerative\ninductive). They may venture occasionally into inferences from\ncorrelational data to causal hypotheses, or to the inference-to-\nthe-best-explanation. But generally they fail to include many\npatterns and style of argument which a naturalistic analysis of\ndiscourse would reveal: appeals to authority, arguments from\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 79 separatereasons,interpretivearguments,adhominemarguments,\nconsistency arguments by analogy, and various other types of\nphilosophical and legal argumentation. In fact, such arguments\nare rarely systematically studied under any name.\nThis is the real danger of the great divide in the positivist\ntheory of argument.

I remain grateful to John\nWisdomforpermittingmetoreadhislecturesonexplanationandproof,\npopularly known as the Virginia Lectures, and to Roger Shiner for\nloaning me his copy of that fascinating material. The doctoral work of\nJerome Bickenbach and the summary provided by Renford Bambrough\nwere also helpful and should remain of interest to scholars. The topic\nofanalogicalargumentshasbeenofinteresttoothers,notablyMarcello\nGuariniandLilianBermejo-Luqueand their students.\nThe question of whether a priori analogies should be considered as\ndistinctfromdeductiveargumentsalsoremainsofinterest;Isensesome\nconsensus in favour of an affirmative answer to that question. In any\nanalogy the target case (topic in question) and the analogue are both\nsimilar and different. Assessment of an argument based on analogy\npresupposes awareness of those similarities and differences, and hinges\nmainly on the issue of their significance (in support, or in objection) to\nthe conclusion claim. Reconstructing those arguments with a universal\nclaim regarded as a missing premise remains a temptation for analysts\nand theorists. It is a temptation I would still resist, for reasons given\nhere.Ofcoursereconstructingbyaddingauniversalmissingpremiseis\nnottheonlywayofrenderingapriorianalogiesdeductively valid;one\ncan take amodus ponensapproach using the associated conditional.\n84TRUDYGOVIER Clearly, if one thinks that a priori analogies are not deductive\narguments, one presumes a distinction between the a priori and the\ndeductive.Onemightsaythataquestionisaprioriifitistoberesolved\nby considerations of concepts, criteria, meaning, and significance;\naccordingly a style of argument would be a priori if these features\ncharacterize it. When we ask whether a priori analogies are deductive\narguments, we need to ask what sort of argument counts as deductive.\nThematterisproblematic.Onemightsaythatanargumentisdeductive\nifthetruthofitspremisesrenderthefalsityofitsconclusionimpossible\nor if the arguer intends that to be the case. On such a definition, it\nis clear that the a priori and the deductive may be distinguished. (Of\ncourse Kant thought so long ago, for different reasons.) Given these\nconceptions of the a priori on the one hand and the deductive on the\nother, I continue to maintain thata priorianalogies are not deductive.\nJohn Wisdom argued that due to its role in settling questions about\ntheapplicationofwords,case-by-casereasoningwasmorefundamental\nfor human thought than either deduction or induction. So far as I am\naware, that challenging hypothesis has not been seriously studied.\nCarl Wellman\u2019s ideas about conductive argument received little\nattention for many years, but have recently been subject to sustained\ndiscussionandcriticism.MyowndevelopmentsofWellman\u2019sideashave\nbeen part of that picture. A key volume, resulting from a Windsor\nconference is Conductive Arguments: An Overlooked Type of\nDefeasibleReasoning,editedbyRalphJohnsonandJ.AnthonyBlair.\nTopics considered in recent discussions include the convergent/linked\ndistinction,waysofdiagrammingthestructureofconductiveargument,\nthe role of counter-considerations in argument, the distinction between\ncounter-considerations and objections, and the appropriacy of such\nlanguageas\u2018weighing\u2019and\u2018balancing\u2019inconsideringthesignificanceof\ncumulating factors. In his work The Concept of Argument, Harald\nWohlrapp argues that the pros and cons of conductive argument can\nbetter be understood as stages in an ongoing discussion, so that in\na process (as distinct from product) model of argument, the category\n\u2018conductive\u2019 will disappear.\nIt is quite possible that a priori analogies and conductive arguments\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 85 are not the only types of arguments ignored because of the misleading\nand spurious exhaustiveness of the inductive/deductive distinction. If\n\u2018inductive\u2019 is so broadly defined that every non-deductive argument\ncounts as inductive, the inductive category will include a large variety\nof argument types. For example, it is common to think of abductive\narguments as inductive. Abductive arguments have not been ignored\nby theorists, a fact that may be due to their importance in scientific\nreasoning. A close study of a variety of works inside and outside\nphilosophymightwellrevealothercandidatesthatareneitherdeductive\nnor empirically inductive in nature. I suspect it would. Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca\u2019s The New Rhetoric could serve as an excellent\nstarting point in the quest for examples.\nTheprevailingtheoriesofargumentamongphilosophersseem\nto be deductivism and positivism. Of course there have been\ndissenters from these views. Some dissenters, such as\nWittgenstein, Toulmin, and Perelman, were people of\nconsiderable professional prominence. Despite this, their views\nonargumenthavenotgreatlyinfluencedthinkingaboutlogicand\nargument.\nAmong dissenting views on reasoning and argument, two are\nof particular interest. The first is that of John Wisdom,\nelaborated most completely in the unpublished lectures\n\u2018Explanation and Proof\u2019, presented at the University of Virginia\nin1957,andcommonlyknownastheVirginiaLectures.Inthese\nlectures, Wisdom described what he called \u2018case-by-case\nreasoning\u2019 or \u2018reasoning by parallels\u2019.1 He argued that it was a\nnondeductive, noninductive, type of reasoning which was, in\nfact, more basic than either deduction or induction. The second\nneglected, but interesting, view is that of Carl Wellman,\narticulated in 1971 in Challenge and Response: Justification in\nEthics.2 Like Wisdom, Weldon challenged the prevailing belief\nthat arguments are either inductive or deductive. He defined a\nthird category which he called \u2018conductive\u2019, in which distinct,\nseparately relevant factors are cited to support a conclusion.\n86TRUDYGOVIER Wellman was concerned to show the relevance of conductive\narguments to issues about the justification of moral beliefs;\nhoweverhisaccounthasbroaderapplicationaswellasthissingle\nimportant one.\nAlthough case-by-case reasoning and conductive reasoning\nare not the same, they fit into a similar gap in the theory of\nargument and may have been widely ignored by philosophers\nfor similar reasons. Both fail to supply deductive support to\nconclusions and yet are frequently used in a priori contexts to\nresolve issues that are conceptual, philosophical, normative, or\nin some other sense nonempirical. In addition, both seem\nrecalcitrant to treatment by general rules. Case-by-case\nreasoning depends on specific similarities and differences\nbetween individual cases. These cases have to be compared and\n\u2018seen\u2019 as such, rather than handled by covering generalizations.\nConductive reasoning depends fundamentally on judgments of\npositive and negative relevance and on how these separately\nrelevant pro and con factors are significant when considered in\nthe balance.\n1. Wisdom\u2019s Virginia Lectures\nJohn Wisdom\u2019s Virginia Lectures offer a sustained elaboration\nand defence of a view which he applied and formulated more\nbriefly in some of his published work. The lectures are\nconveniently and accurately summarized in a paper by D.\nYalden-Thomas, available in a collection of essays on Wisdom\u2019s\nphilosophy. They were the subject of several doctoral\ndissertations in the late nineteen fifties and of a thorough\nanalysis in a 1977 doctoral dissertation by Jerome Bickenbach.\nTo some extent, Wisdom\u2019s views have been promulgated by his\nformer students and colleagues: several works on meta-\nphilosophy and meta-ethics, including Renford Bambrough\u2019s\nMoral Scepticism and Moral Knowledge. Stephen Barker\u2019s Elements\nof Logic shows Wisdom\u2019s influence, particularly in footnotes and\ncautionary comments in the third edition. Barker was in the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 87 audience in Virginia, and some of his questions and comments\nappearinthetypescriptofthelectures.3Onthewhole,however,\nWisdom\u2019s views have had little influence on those who reflect\non the nature and types of argument.4 Even a recent paper\nconcerned to defend analogy as a distinct form of inference and\nreferring to a wide variety of sources neglects Wisdom\u2019s view.\nAccording to Wisdom, the most basic, primary, kind of\nreasoning is case-by-case reasoning. This reasoning is used,\neither explicitly or implicitly, in order to show that a word is\nproperly applied to a particular case. Since both deduction and\ninductionpresumetheproperapplicationofwordstoparticular\ninstances,anykindofreasoningwhichisaprerequisiteofdoing\nthis can lay claim to \u2018most basic\u2019 status. Examples of instances\nwhere issues of correct application of a term arise are whether\na pattern of behavior amounts to negligence; whether the Jews\nconstitute a nation; and whether a trailer that has been fixed\nin one position is still a mobile home. There may be important\ndisputes in such cases and there is a rational way to resolve\nthem. We find an instance which is clearly a case of negligence,\nnationhood, being a mobile home, or whatever, and we closely\ncompareandcontrastthatinstancewiththeunresolvedone.The\nonly way to show that terms have been correctly applied is to\nreasonfromagreedinstancesoftheircorrectapplication.Inthis\nway, we can argue for a conclusion on the point. Case-by-case\nreasoning is a species of argument from analogy.\nWisdom considered four sorts of contexts in which case-by-\ncase reasoning is necessary: where we need to resort to\ncomparison with a paradigm; where we are evaluating\n\u2018paradoxical\u2019 statements such as those commonly made in\nmetaphysics; where we are trying to resolve borderline cases;\nand where criteria are not sufficiently explicit to bring out\ncorrect standards of applicability in a process of deduction. The\nsecond context here is tied to metaphilosophical disputes in the\nforties and fifties, and merits some explanatory comment.\nWisdom had in mind such claims as \u2018nothing is really solid\u2019.\n88TRUDYGOVIER His concern was to show that reasons could be offered for and\nagainst such metaphysical statements, and that they were not\nmeaningless as positivists had maintained but were, rather,\nsignificant statements \u2014though notabout either matters offact\nor matters of verbal usage.\nQuestionsaboutthecorrectapplicationofsuchtermsas\u2018solid\u2019,\n\u2018negligence\u2019, \u2018nation\u2019, \u2018race\u2019, \u2018solvent\u2019, and many others are not\npurely verbal: they may have profound legal, political, moral,\nor psychological significance. Wisdom had an ingenious way of\ncontrasting purely verbal disputes with significant conceptual\nones.Heclaimedthatiftwopeoplehaveapurelyverbaldispute,\ntheir disagreement could be explained by the way in which they\nhaveusedwordsinthepast.Theirpastusagewouldbedivergent.\nHowever, in a case where two people are disagreeing on a\nsignificant conceptual issue, such as whether anything is really\nsolid, in the light of particle physics, this disagreement is not\nnecessarily reflected in differences as to how they have\npreviously applied the term. Rather, it is a difference as to the\ncorrectdecisionabouthowthetermshouldbeusedinthefuture,\ninthelightofsignificantnewdata.Noristhedifferencebetween\nthem a factual one, for it will not be resolved by future\nobservations. In an inductive argument, we reason to a\nconclusion that can, in principle, be determined in some other\ncontext to be true or false on the basis of empirical observation.\nBut here, the issue is one that requires decision as distinct from\nprediction.\nWhere some authors have contrasted a priori and inductive\nanalogy, Wisdom tends to use \u2018analogy\u2019 to refer to inductive\nanalogy and to call what others term \u2018a priori analogy\u2019 case-by-\ncase reasoning. The difference as he understands it is that in\nstandard, or inductive, analogy we support a prediction about a\ncase by comparing it with an actual known case.

In such\ncases, we use actual instances to predict unknown ones, and\nfuture experience will show whether we are right or wrong.\n1a. A Priori Analogy\nWith Wisdom\u2019s case-by-case reasoning (or a priori analogy)\nit does not matter whether the instance used as a basis for\ncomparison is actual or hypothetical, and the reasoning issues\nin a decision, not a prediction. Consider, for instance, Judith\nThompson\u2019s famous analogy between the woman carrying an\nunwanted fetus and the person who unexpectedly finds herself\nhooked up to a dying violinist.5 The analogue is obviously\nhypothetical, but this fact does not affect the merits of the\nargument.Thompsonisarguingthatthetwocasesarerelevantly\nsimilar,soifwegrantthatthereisnoobligationtorestrictone\u2019s\nactivities to support the life of the violinist, we ought, in\nconsistency, to believe there is no obligation for the\nunexpectedly and unwillingly pregnant woman to adapt her\nactivities so as to support the life of the fetus. In case-by-case\nreasoning, as contrasted with inductive analogy, there is no way\nof taking further measures to find out by empirical observation\nwhether the parallelism suggested here is or is not the case.\nIn his systematic study of Wisdom\u2019s theory, Bickenbach\nreferred to case-by-case reasoning as \u2018reflective reasoning\u2019,\nfollowing Wisdom\u2019s emphasis. In the present discussion the\nterms \u2018a priori analogy\u2019 and \u2018logical analogy\u2019 are used. Because\nthereisreasoning thatgoes fromonecasetoanother andthatis\ninductive,theexpression\u2018case-by-casereasoning\u2019doesnotquite\nserve to pick out the kind of reasoning Wisdom was dealing\nwith: it is too broad. So too is the concept of reflection.\nThe thrust that underlies logical analogies is that of\nconsistency \u2013 not the consistency required in order to avoid\nassenting to contradictory propositions, but rather, the\nconsistency required for consistent behavior. This is the\n90TRUDYGOVIER consistency of treating relevantly similar cases similarly. It is\ninconsistent to say that all men are poor listeners while\nadmitting that John and Fred, both men, are good listeners. It\nis, in another and equally important sense, inconsistent to treat\nrelevantly similar cases differently. If one organism is regarded\nas alive and another as not alive, there must be a relevant\ndifference between them, at pain of inconsistency. If one man\nis given three years for theft and another three months, there\nmust be a relevant difference between them, or else the law is\ninconsistently (and unjustly) administered. Logical analogy\nfocuses on similarities between cases, and arguments based on\nsuchanalogiesurgeustomakeadecisiononacasebasedonthe\nconsideration of a closely similar one. We are pushed to do so\nby considerations of consistency: similar treatment for similar\ncases.\nThe negative use of logical analogy is found in the technique\nofrefutingargumentsbycitingparallelflawedarguments.Iftwo\narguments are fundamentally similar as to structure, and the\nfirst is flawed, the second is flawed also. To regard one of the\narguments as cogent and the other as not cogent would be to\nmake decisions inconsistently. This is a familiar use of logical\nanalogy. Wisdom, in his lectures, emphasized the philosophical,\nmoral, and legal contexts in which such reasoning is ubiquitous\nand necessary. The appeal to consistency is also extremely\nimportant in law, moral reasoning, and administration.\nWhen he gave the Virginia Lectures, Wisdom seems to have\nbeen more interested in reasoning and epistemology \u2013\nparticularly the epistemology of philosophy itself \u2013 than he was\ninargumentassuch.Nevertheless,itisclearthathethoughtthat\ncase-by-case reasoning was not only a distinct and important\ntype of reasoning but was the basis for a distinct and important\ntype of argument. Any temptation to remodel logical or\ninductive analogies into deductive or inductive arguments\nshouldberesisted,becausethetypeofreasoningsucharguments\nemploy is not only a distinct and quite proper type of reasoning\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 91 butis, infact,morefundamental thanthealternativetowhichit\nis to be \u2018reduced\u2019. Arguments based on appeals to cases are not\nreducible to arguments of some other type.\nAs with other nondeductive arguments, a priori and inductive\nanalogies can be recast as deductively valid arguments, if we are\nwillingtoaddgeneralpremisesofasufficientlysweepingnature.\nConsider any analogy:\n1. (1) Case x has features a,b,c.\n2. (2) Case y has features a,b,c.\n3. (3) Case x is of type e.\nTherefore,\n4. (4) Case y is of type e.\nOne might regard such an argument as elliptical, insisting that\ncases (x) and (y) must both be subsumed under the appropriate\ngeneralization. Thus:\n1. Case x has features a,b,c.\n2. Case y has features a,b,c.\n3. Case x is of type e.\nMissing Premise: Allthings whichhavefeaturesa,b,c, areof\ntype e.\nTherefore,\n4. Case y is of type e.\nBut there are significant objections to such an approach.\nThe added premise makes two of the stated premises\nredundant as far as the logic of the inference is concerned. If we\nknow that all things with a,b,c, are of type e, then we can apply\nthat universal statement to case (y) directly. We have no need\nfor premises (1) and (3), which cite information about case (x).\n92TRUDYGOVIER The comparison of cases is unnecessary. The supplementation\nmakes the key premises which describe the analogy redundant.\nIn effect, the reconstructed argument ceases to be an analogy.\nA particular (case y) is simply subsumed under a generalization.\nThe analogy has been destroyed, not recast.\nIn defense of this enthymematic approach to analogy, one\nmight seek to incorporate case (x) into the argument in a purely\npsychological way, saying that it serves to remind us of the\ngeneral truth under which case (y) is subsumed. This suggestion\nstill leaves the conclusion that there are no inferences-by-\nanalogy: analogy is purely a psychological crutch. In fact, this\nview has been taken seriously by some authors of logic\ntextbooks, including Susan Stebbing and Monroe Beardsley.6\nNevertheless, given that the generalization must bear the whole\nweight of the argument, it is rather unsatisfactory to have to\nadmit that a subsumed particular case is psychologically\nnecessary in order for us to remember what that generalization\nis. We may ask why the generalization is not more directly\naccessible, if it is known. And the word \u2018if\u2019 should be taken\nseriously here.\nThe requisite generalization is typically not known and this,\nindeed, is usually the primary reason for appealing to analogy\nin the first place. We do compare cases as such, and we can do\nthis in the absence of a known generalization. As W.H. Shaw\nandL.R.Ashleypointoutintheirarticleonanalogicalinference,\nmuchfamiliarreasoninginvolvesthedirectcomparisonofcases\nwithout appeal to an intermediate generalization. Ashley and\nShaw say:\nAlternatively,considertherichemploymentofanalogiesincontemporary\nethical writing. Where is the implicit enumerative induction?

In\nfact, even to formulate them is often a challenge.\nIf we knew, somehow, that all reasoning had to be deductive,\nwe would have grounds for insisting that such reconstruction\nof a priori analogies is necessary. But we do not know this, and\nwe have no such basis. Analogies are, and should be, appraised\nnotbyformulatingandcriticizinggeneralizations,butbycareful\nconsideration of the relevant similarities and differences\nbetween the cases considered. This point holds for both a priori\nand inductive analogies. (Wisdom, as explained, was\nemphasizing the former over the latter.)\nIn Moral Scepticism and Moral Knowledge, Renford Bambrough\ndefends Wisdom\u2019s claim that reasoning about cases is logically\npriortoreasoningbytheapplicationofuniversalclaimsorrules.\nIf a case is to be settled, and we try to settle it by deducing a\nconclusionfromauniversalrule,theepistemological problemis\nthat the universal rule already includes a resolution of this case.\nBambrough says:\nOnceweareconvincedthattherewillbenoexceptionswemaystateour\nconclusion in the form of an exceptionless rule, but such a rule cannot\nbe the fundamental ground upon which we accept a conclusion about\none of its own instances. Whatever is to provide us with grounds for a\nconclusionaboutthisinstanceofanargumentinthisformmusttakethe\nformofconsideringotherarguments,otherinstances.Arulewillnotdo\nthe work, for a rule cannot refer to the others without referring to this\none as well. It does not compete, but simply awards itself the prize.8\nHere, Bambrough turns the tables on those who would make\nindividual judgments about cases dependent on universal or\ngeneral rules. He sees general rules as arbitrary considered\nsimply in themselves and as gaining their credibility (implicitly\norexplicitly)fromtheir correctapplication toinstances. Onthis\nanalysis, Bambrough follows Wisdom in thinking that cases can\n94TRUDYGOVIER stand alone. Mill, Moore, and Wittgenstein also accepted this.\nBut it is a minority position in philosophy. Philosophers have\nusually been inclined to have universal principles stand alone as\n\u2018self-evident\u2019 logical or moral truths.\n1b. The Universal and the Particular\nTheissueraisedhereiswhethertheuniversalortheparticular\nis logically prior. We may say, with Wisdom, Moore, and\nBambrough, that nothing can have greater force than a clearly\nunderstood particular case, and that what universal truths we\nknow are in one way or another derived from our knowledge\nof such cases. Or, as is more common in a generalizing and\ntheorizing discipline, we may regard particular cases as\nepistemically incomplete, as being mere expressions of intuition\nor common sense unless \u2018grounded\u2019 in universal principles. In\nfact, this general issue itself may be stated in a way that is too\ninsensitive to particulars. Perhaps the truth is that what is\nepistemically prior varies from case to case and from context\nto context. But at the very least we can find in Wisdom and\nBambrough, as in Mill, Moore, and Wittgenstein a useful,\nreminder that arguments from universal premises are not\nwithout their epistemic problems.\nDespite their insistence that analogical inference is a distinct\ntype,ShawandAshleytaketheoppositeviewtoWisdom\u2019sabout\nparticulars and universals. They see the general as more\nfundamental than the particular and urge that a full\nunderstanding of relevance and irrelevance depends on\nbackground theory. On their account, a full understanding of\nthe cases compared in an analogy will ultimately require a\nbackground theory, in which we are told why certain features\na,b,carerelevanttothejudgmentthatcasesxandyareoftypee.\nShawandAshleyallowthatanalogies,bothaprioriandinductive,\nconstitute a distinct type of argument. They acknowledge the\nepistemic difficulty of formulating and knowing the requisite\ngeneralization for remodelling the arguments. And yet they see\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 95 the appeals to relevant similarities on which analogies depend\nare theoretically incomplete.\nConsistency is a basic constraint on human reasoning, and we must at\nthe very least judge similar situations similarly \u2026. even in the absence\nofaclearnotionofrelevance,theresemblanceoftwosituationsprovides\nsomewarrantfortheinferencethatwhatisrightinonecaseisrightin\nthe other. But this may be thought to beg the question. Do we not need\natheorytodesignatetherelevantandirrelevantsimilarities?Ultimately\nyes. But in the meantime we have, prior to any particular normative\ntheory, a perception of two situations as similar, and this is enough\n(along with our commitment to consistency) to provide some intrinsic\nplausibility to the analogical move.9\nWisdom would have regarded such a view as symptomatic\nof \u2018Euclid\u2019s disease\u2019, an ailment he and Wittgenstein diagnosed\nin those who disparage particular cases and regard universal\nknowledge, by \u2018criterion\u2019 or general reason, as the only\nknowledge. He saw judgments about the relevance and\nsignificance of features of individual cases and resemblances\nbetween those features of cases as being ultimate, and as not\nrequiring or being amenable to further justification by appeal to\nanythingmorebasic.AccordingtothemanuscriptoftheVirginia\nLectures, Barker asked Wisdom why it was that the particular\ncasealwayshadmoreepistemicforcethanauniversalthatmight\nbe cited in support. In raising that question, Barker suggested\nthateachmighthaveforceand,insomecontext,requirerevision\nof the other. Barker, in effect, anticipated a version of Rawls\u2019\ninfluential view that we seek \u2018reflective equilibrium\u2019 between\ntheoretical principles and nontheoretical judgments about\nparticular cases. In response, Wisdom reiterated the\npredominance of the particular as a ground for generalization,\nsaying:\nWhat most plainly presents the data on which the rest is based is the\nargument from particulars to particulars.10\n96TRUDYGOVIER Following Wisdom, Bickenbach contended that a major\nsymptomofEuclid\u2019sdiseaseisthebeliefthatsystematizationisa\nprecondition for genuine or complete understanding.11\nWhether the judgments about the relevance of various\nsimilarities and differences that underlie our evaluation of\nanalogiesareinsomeultimatesensetheory-dependentisabroad\nphilosophical issue that cannot be resolved here. The notion of\nreflective equilibrium between theoretical and case judgments\nhas been applied by Goodman to deductive and inductive logic\nand by Rawls and others to ethical and political theory. It\nrequires that both particular judgments about cases and\ntheoretical principles have some initial credibility. Sometimes it\nisreasonableforustoreviseourpre-theoreticaljudgmentsabout\nindividual cases on the basis of principles; sometimes, we seek\nto build up theoretical principles on the bases of knowledge of\ncases. We may revise principles if they do not fit our judgments\nabout particulars that would be subsumed under them. We may\nalso revise our judgments about cases according to principles\nthatwehaveaccepted.Thusprinciplesandcase-basedjudgments\nmust each be adjusted in the light of the other.12\nEven if the disputable view that the general is always logically\npriortotheparticularweretobetrue,thepertinentbackground\ntheories often do not yet exist. In the meantime, it is clear that\nanalogies, botha prioriand inductive, have a real epistemic use.\nHume\u2019s Dialogues on Natural Religion contain many vivid\nillustrations of arguments of this type. Consider, for instance,\nthis example:\nThe Brahmins assert that the world arose from an infinite spider, who\nspun this whole complicated mass from his bowels, and annihilates\nafterwards the whole or any part of it, by absorbing it again and\nresolving it into his own essence. Here is a species of cosmogony which\nappears to us ridiculous because a spider is a little contemptible animal\nwhose operations we are never likely to take for a model of the whole\nuniverse. But still, here is a new species of analogy, even in our globe.\nAnd were there a planet wholly inhabited by spiders (which is very\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 97 possible), this inference would there appear as natural and irrefragable\nas that which in our planet ascribes the origin of all things to design\nandorderlysystemandintelligence,asexplainedbyCleanthes.Whyan\norderlysystemmaynotbespunfromthebellyaswellasthebrain,itwill\nbe difficult for him to give a satisfactory reason.13\nThis argument is an a priori analogy between two arguments;\nthe spider\u2019s argument that the world has been spun from the\nbowels of an infinite spider is compared to the human\u2019s\nargument that the world has been designed by an infinitely\nexpanded human mind. Hume invites us to see the second\nargument as being as ridiculous as the first.\nApart from Hume, other prime philosophical sources for a\npriori analogies include Robert Nozick\u2019s Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia, and Stanley Cavell\u2019s The Claim of Reason. Given that this\ntechnique of arguing is common among philosophers, it is\nsurprisingthatithasnotreceivedmoreattentionfromtheorists.\nSuch analogies are common, not only in philosophical\nthinking about moral problems, but in ordinary non-\nphilosophical thinking as well. Nor is this kind of reasoning\nrestricted to the moral realm. It is also used in conceptual and\ninterpretive contexts, by philosophers and others. Consistency\nreasoning is prominent in law, especially in the common law\nsystem where cases may be resolved by appeals to precedent.\nEven where there are explicit statutes, constituent terms are\ninterpreted according to their prior application to cases. The\ncore of legal reasoning is, as Wisdom noted, case by case. The\nappraisal of such reasoning requires careful attention to the\nsimilarities and differences between the cases, and a judgment\nas to how relevant these similarities and differences are to the\ndecision at hand.\nA type of argument of obvious prominence and importance\nhas been widely ignored by theorists. Probably this is due to\nthe fact that it is less prominent in science and in mathematics\nthaninmorallife,law,administration,criticism,andphilosophy.\n98TRUDYGOVIER Philosophers have tended to construct theories of knowledge\nand argument as though positivism were true.\nCase-by-case reasoning as Wisdom describes it is not itself\namenable to extensive theoretical analysis. Case-by-case\nreasoning is recalcitrant to treatment by general rules, because\nwe cannot say in general what cases are going to be similar\nand why. This may lead us to think that endorsing it will lead\ninevitablytoscepticismorrelativism.Butnosuchconsequences\nfollow.\nIn isolation from information about which cases are at issue\nand why they are being compared, what may be said? One\npossibility is to explore further cases. If two cases are deemed\nto possess feature e in virtue of other features a,b,c then that\nimplies thatthefeaturesa,b,c, function toestablish e,other things\nbeing equal. This relationship should hold in general. If we find\na third case in which the relationship does not hold, we then\nmust seek further to see how that case might undermine the\nbasis of the analogy. It might turn out that the new case differs\nfrom the original analogue with respect to some feature f and\nthat it is f which undermines e. If so, the original analogy tacitly\ndepended on the two compared cases both lacking feature f. By\nacloseexaminationofrelevantlysimilarandrelevantlydifferent\ncases, we can rationally adjudicate differences of belief as to\nwhethercomparisonsareaptandwhetherparticularsimilarities\nand differences are significant.\nIt is an open question as to whether we can set out a general\n\u2018logic\u2019 for appraising a priori analogies. Wisdom and others\nfollowing him tend to write as though this could not be done.\nTheir opinion has probably been shared by systematic logicians,\nwho have always found analogy less interesting than deductive\nreasoning and empirical inductive reasoning. Whether a set of\nrules for the comparing and contrasting of cases can be devised\nremains to be seen. But even if it cannot, this would not entail\nthat case-by-case reasoning fails to exist at all. Whether or not\nsuch reasoning is recalcitrant to systematization, it is real.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 99 My point, like Wisdom\u2019s, is not merely descriptive. It is\nnormative as well. Case-by-case arguments, or a priori analogies,\narebothrealandepistemicallylegitimate.Iwouldurgethatsome\nsuch arguments are good ones and can establish a conclusion.\nThough rules may not exist to resolve disputes about the merits\nof these arguments, there remains room for rational debate and\nreasonableresolution.Similaritiesanddifferencescanbepointed\nout, and the significance of these can be rationally discussed.\nTo the Euclidean theorist who is not satisfied with such a\nresponse, we can reply by turning the tables. Rules and\ngeneralizations do not stand independently. They themselves\nultimately require justification, and in the final analysis will\nreceive it from their application to cases.\n2. Carl Wellman and the Concept of Conductive Argument\nDo philosophers prove by chains of demonstrative reasoning what they\nwish to say or without attempting to support in any way one thing\nby another, just set out the self-evident or what appears to them self-\nevident? This question gives one a queer feeling because one wants to\nanswer that they do both and neither \u2026 It is true that, when we read,\nfor example, Hume\u2019s appendix on the analysis of right and good or\nBroad on theories of the nature of matter, we find that a number of\nwhatMillmightcall\u2018considerationscapableofinfluencingtheintellect\u2019\nare advanced. But they are not connected chainwise. They bear\nindependently upon the issue.14\nCarl Wellman\u2019s Challenge and Response was ostensibly about\nmeta-ethics, but in fact dealt largely with the subject of\njustification in general. Wellman devoted much time and care\nto discussing the question \u2018What is justification?\u2019, and had some\nratherunorthodoxthingstosayinreply.Hesummeduphisview\nas follows:\n\u2026justificationistobeunderstoodessentiallyasaprocessofresponding\ntochallengesmade.Itmaybeobservedanddescribedasapsychological\nstruggleinwhichonepersontriestoforceanothertobackdown,orone\nperson struggles to come to terms with his own doubts and conflicting\n100TRUDYGOVIER convictions. But it is more than a psychological struggle because at\nits core are certain critical claims to truth, validity, to be upsetting,\nto be reassuring, and to be adequate. Therefore the actual outcome of\nany particular psychological struggle never settles once and for all the\nissuesbeingfoughtoverintheprocessofjustification.Itisthispeculiar\nambivalence of justification that enables what we actually do in\ndiscussion and thinking to serve as a test of critical ideas like truth,\nvalidity, and being justified.15\nMuch justification proceeds by argument and Wellman said\nsome interesting and unusual things about arguments in his\nbook.\nWellmanarguedthattheinductive/deductivedichotomyisnot\nexhaustive and that there is at least one other type of argument,\nwhich he termed \u2018conductive\u2019. Wellman\u2019s definitions of\n\u2018deductive\u2019 and \u2018inductive\u2019 are somewhat unusual. He defines\ndeduction much as Copi does: a deductive argument is one in\nwhich the claim is made that the conclusion follows necessarily\nfrom the premises. In ethics, which is his primary concern,\nWellman associates deduction with deriving conclusions about\ncasesbysubsumingthecasesundergeneralprinciples.Induction\naccording to Wellman, is that sort of reasoning by which a\nhypothesis is confirmed or disconfirmed by establishing the\ntruth or falsity of its implications. Conduction, a third type of\nreasoning, is distinct from both deduction and induction, being\nthat sort of reasoning in which (1) a conclusion about some\nindividual case (2) is drawn nonconclusively (3) from one or\nmore premises about the same case (4) without any appeal to\nother cases. In conductive reasoning where there are several\nsupporting premises, we draw together these independently\nrelevant factors to support a conclusion. A conductive argument,\nthen, depends crucially upon the concept of relevance. It differs\nfrom a deductive argument because the factors cited do not\nentail, and are not put forward as being sufficient for, the\nconclusion stated. It differs from an inductive argument in that\nit is not a case of confirming or disconfirming hypotheses by\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 101 instances and in that (typically) separately relevant reasons are\ncited in support of a normative, conceptual, or philosophical\nconclusion. The issue is frequently not empirical.\nWellman sought to establish this third category of argument\nin order to show that there is more flexibility than most of us\nsupposeinthematterofjustifyingconclusions.Hewasespecially\nconcerned to combat the common view that justification in\nethics must be a matter of deriving particular conclusions from\nuniversal or general principles. On Wellman\u2019s account there are\natleastthreedifferenttypesofethicalreasoning,allofwhichare\nused to justify conclusions about what we should do. First, we\nmay deduce such conclusions from general principles, in cases\nwhere we are certain enough of such principles to use them\nin this way. Second, we may confirm or disconfirm general\nhypotheses using judgments about particular instances, thus\nreasoninginductivelyinWellman\u2019ssense.Third,wemaysupport\naconclusionaboutaparticularproblembycitingafactorseveral\nfacts that are nonconclusively relevant to it.\nSuppose one says, \u2018You ought to take your son to the movie\nbecause you promised to do so, it is a good movie, and you\nhave nothing better to do this afternoon\u2019. One is reasoning\nconductively to a conclusion about what to do.\nWellman\u2019s discussion may appear less generally interesting\nthan it is due to his contestable accounts of deduction and\ninduction. There are problems with defining deductive\narguments in terms of \u2018claim to necessary connection\u2019; in many\narguments there is just nothing to indicate whether such a\nconnection is claimed or not. Furthermore, Wellman\nunnecessarily limits himself to deduction from the universal to\nthe particular. Obviously, there are other forms of deduction.\nThen again, Wellman\u2019s definition of \u2018induction\u2019 is highly\nidiosyncratic,asherecognizeshimself.Onemightmaintainthat\nit is useful to have an account which allows for induction in\na priori contexts. A problem arises because many modus tollens\narguments, which are deductively valid, will count as inductive\n102TRUDYGOVIER in Wellman\u2019s sense. Consider, \u2018If all my students are computer\nscience majors, then since Joe is my student Joe will be a\ncomputersciencemajor.ButJoeisnotacomputersciencemajor.\nTherefore the hypothesis that all my students are computer\nsciencemajorsisincorrect\u2019isanargumentinwhichahypothesis\nis disconfirmed by an instance. It is inductive according to\nWellman\u2019s definition. But obviously it is deductively valid. And\nit could be claimed to be deductive in Wellman\u2019s sense too \u2013 it\ncaneasilyberegardedas\u2018claiming\u2019deductivevalidity.Wellman\u2019s\nnotion of induction is too broad because it will include some\ndeductively valid arguments to count as inductive. But it is also\ntoo narrow, given that causal reasoning, reasoning to the best\nexplanation, and reasoning from generalizations based on past\nexperience to a future case will not count as inductive in this\nsense. These results are highly (and unnecessarily) counter-\nintuitive. With such an unorthodox concept of \u2018induction\u2019 the\nclaim that there is a distinct type of non-deductive and non-\ninductivereasoningmayappeartobenomorethantheresultof\nan unorthodox classificatory system.\nAs Wellman noted, but did not emphasize, conductive\nreasoning is not restricted to ethical contexts. It is common in\ncontexts where we are trying to reach a decision about a\nclassificatory issue, in interpretive contexts, and in contexts of\nphilosophy and theory. Arguments that are conductive typically\nbring forward several relevant factors in the premises. It may\nhappenthatonlyonenonconclusivelyrelevantfactoriscited;in\nthis case, the difference between the conductive argument and a\ndeductiveoneisthatthefactorisnotsufficientandotherfactors,\nnot mentioned, could have been mentioned to count as well.\nAlso,conductiveargumentationisafavouredcontextfor\u2018pros\u2019\nand \u2018cons\u2019 in arguing. We may allow that there are factors\nrelevant to the conclusion that count against it, mention these\nin the argument, and then cite supportive factors for the\nconclusion. We judge, and ask our audience to judge, that the\nsupportive factors outweigh the counter considerations.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 103 Consider, for example, the following interpretive argument:\nHume is not a sceptic, for although he argues that our basic beliefs are\nnotrationallyjustified,herailsagainstclassicalsceptics,andhemaintains\nthat we are as much determined to believe as we are to think and feel.\nThis is a conductive argument of the \u2018pro and con\u2019 type. One\nfactoriscitedwhichwouldcounttowardsHumebeingasceptic,\nand two other factors are cited which would count against that\nview. The latter two factors are deemed to outweigh the first\nonesothattheargumentoverallpresentsgoodreasontobelieve\nthat Hume is a sceptic. Much actual reasoning seems to involve\nthis kind of consideration of pros and cons, and estimating or\n\u2018summing up\u2019 their collective significance. A conductive\nargument may be the product of such reasoning about pros and\ncons. It will typically involve the specification of several such\nfactors and adduce a conclusion on the basis of what the arguer\ntakes to be their cumulative force.Such arguments had been\ntacitly recognized by other writers.\n2a. Related Views\nKurt Baier\u2019s emphasis on \u2018good reasons\u2019 arguments in ethics\nis one case in point. In The Moral Point of View, first published\nin 1958, Kurt Baier described the variety of reasons available to\njustify moral conclusions, and seems to have had something like\nconductive arguments in mind. He said:\nTo say that a certain fact is a consideration, a pro or a con, is to say\nthat this fact gives rise to a presumption, namely, that the agent ought\nor ought not to enter on the course of action in relation to which the\nfactisaprooracon.Exactlythesamepointismadewhenitisclaimed\nthatsomereasonsareprima-faciereasons,orreasonsotherthingsbeing\nequal. All that is meant is that the facts which are the reasonsgive rise\nmerelytoapresumptionthattheagentoughtoroughtnottoenteronthe\nline contemplated.16\nBoth Michael Scriven and Stephen Thomas noted the\n104TRUDYGOVIER existence of arguments in which distinct factors cumulate, or\nconverge, to support a conclusion. However, in neither case was\nthere much discussion of such arguments as a distinct type.17\nThomas, in fact, incorporated theorizing inconsistent with the\nclaim. As a result of my critical notice in the Informal Logic\nNewsletter, calling attention to Wellman\u2019s account and arguing\nfor its significance, David Hitchcock incorporated a recognition\nof conductive arguments in his textbook. In general, however,\nWellman\u2019s account did little to upset philosophers\u2019 confidence\nin deductivism and positivism as theories of ordinary\nargumentation.\nThe notion of conductive argument does not owe its interest\nsolely to Wellman\u2019s somewhat idiosyncratic classificatory\nsystem. The idea that in many arguments the basic notion is\nthatofnonconclusiverelevanceandthatsuchargumentsreadily\nincorporate \u2018pro and con\u2019 considerations is important and had\nbeen explicitly or tacitly recognized by other analysts. What I\nshouldliketodohereisendorseWellman\u2019sideasaboutrelevance\nand pros and cons and drop some other features of his account.\nI do not wish to endorse his definitions of \u2018induction\u2019 and\n\u2018deduction\u2019, nor his limitation of conductive reasoning to\ncontexts where a particular conclusion is defended. Wellman\nmadeconductiveargumentsbydefinitionaboutparticularcases.\nBut this seems unfortunate, as it is easy to think of examples\nwhere separate facts are cited to nonconclusively support\ngeneralization. Consider, for instance:\nBlacks are equal to whites because they are as healthy as whites, they\narebiologicallysimilartowhites,theyareasintelligentaswhites,andthey\nshare basic needs with whites.\nWhatever the substantive merits of this argument, we can\nreadily see that it is based on separate nonconclusively relevant\npremises. It is the sort of argument where \u2018cons\u2019 could be\nacknowledged and \u2018weighed\u2019 with the \u2018pros\u2019. The various\npremises about blacks and whites are separately relevant to the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 105 conclusion in the sense that if one were false, the others would\nremainunaffected.ThustheexamplefitsmuchofwhatWellman\nhas to say, and yet the conclusion is not particular in form.\nClearly,wemayreasonaboutcasesbycitingrelevantfactors,and\ninaddition,muchconductivereasoningisaboutcases.However,\nconductive reasoning may also be used to support conclusions\nthat are general or universal in form.\nConductive argument and a priori analogy are distinct types.\nWellman says that in conduction the link between premises and\nconclusion is not established on the basis of the experience of\nanalogous cases; it is entirelya priori.\nConductive reasoning and Wisdom\u2019s case-by-case reasoning\nfit into a similar gap unnoticed by many who have supported\ndeductivist and positivist theories of argument. Both deal with\nnonempirical reasoning that is nonconclusive, or at least not\n\u2018conclusive\u2019 in the deductive sense. Conductive arguments\nrequire separately relevant non-sufficient factors and readily\nadmit counterconsiderations as part of the argument; a priori\nanalogies use comparison of cases to press for consistency of\ntreatment,anddependfundamentallyontheconceptofrelevant\nsimilarity.\nTo clarify the contrast between conductive arguments and\nothers, it is useful to refer to different ways premises may\ncombine to support conclusions in multi-premise arguments.\nThese different styles of support have to do with the structural\narrangementofpremises,andnotwiththestrengthorcharacter\nof the support those premises are able to give to a conclusion.\nNor do they concern the truth or plausibility of the premises.\nThey concern the diagramming of arguments, not their\nclassificationorinferentialappraisal.Theclassicaccountsofthis\nstyle of support are Beardsley\u2019s early text and Thomas\u2019 text on\nreasoning in natural language. The latter is justly famous for its\nexpositionofstructureandadaptationofBeardsley\u2019stechniques.\nThe distinction presented is between convergent and linked\nargumentation.18 When the pattern of support is linked, one\n106TRUDYGOVIER premise is not even relevant to the conclusion without the\nothers.Inaconvergentsupportpattern,premisesbearseparately\nupon the conclusion. All conductive arguments exemplify the\nconvergentpatternorsupport,exceptinthelimitingcasewhere\nthere is only one premise. However, the converse does not hold,\nas Wellman was careful to note. It is possible to offer an\nargument which exemplifies the convergent support pattern, in\nwhich there are several different premises, each of which, taken\nalone, deductively entails the conclusion. This situation may\noccureitherbecausethearguerexpectsthatsomeofhispremises\nwill be contested or because he is not aware that the entailment\nrelationships hold and make some of his premises logically\nredundant. He offers more reasons than are logically required.\nIn a conductive argument, the premises strengthen each other\nas support, even when they are not in question: \u2018it is the logical\nforce,nottheprobativeforce,oftheargumentthatisincreasedwiththe\naddition of each new premise\u2019,Wellman says.19\nWe cannot define conductive arguments solely with reference\nto the convergent support pattern, because if we were to do\nso, some deductive arguments would be conductive. There is\na similar problem with induction. Some inductive arguments\nuse the convergent support pattern, particularly if a number of\ndistinct, and apparently unrelated cases, are cited to support a\ngeneralization. Typically, in a conductive argument no one\npremise deductively entails the conclusion. Nor do the premises\nentail the conclusion when considered together. The premises\ncount in favour of the conclusion in the sense that they are,\nor are taken by the arguer to be, positively relevant to it. Here\n\u2018relevant\u2019 does not mean \u2018sufficient.\u2019 The method by which we\nassessaconductiveargumentisnottotestfordeductivevalidity.\nRather, it is to ask ourselves whether the premises are relevant,\nhow much support they give to the conclusion, and whether\nunmentioned factors that are also relevant to the conclusion\nwould \u2018outweigh\u2019 the premises. We may also consider further\ncases to test claims of relevance. The conclusion is not a\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 107 generalization from cases, as it would be in an enumerative\ninduction. Nor does it presume empirical regularities among\nconsideredcasesorthekindofbackgroundempiricalknowledge\nneeded for explanatory or causal inductive reasoning. Whether\nX is relevant to Y, in these contexts, is a conceptual, normative,\nor \u2018criterial\u2019 issue.\nA priori analogies, like all analogies, employ the linked pattern\nof support. They are of the general type:\n1. X has features a,b,c.\n2. Y has features a,b,c.\n3. X has feature e.\nTherefore,\n4. Y has feature e.\nThe premises link to support the conclusion, as they do also in\nthe more schematic version of analogy:\n1. X is similar to Y.\n2. Y has feature e.\nTherefore,\n3. X has feature e.\nWisdom dealt with analogy arguments in which support is\nlinked and reasoning moves from a point about one case to a\nconclusion about another. Wellman deals with arguments in\nwhichthesupportisconvergentandconnectionsarebycriterial\nrelevance, not comparison. Thus we must have two types, not\none.\n2b. Further Examples\nSince Wellman\u2019s main concern was with the justification of\n108TRUDYGOVIER ethical propositions, he gave examples primarily from the\ndomain of moral reasoning. But this restriction is not essential;\nexamples dealing with many subjects can be found. Here is one,\ncited by Scriven.\nWe can be proud that America has turned the corner on the depression\nof the last few years. At last the many indexes of recovery are showing\noptimisticreadings.Therateofinflationhasslowed,unemploymenthas\nmoreorlessstabilized,inventoriesarebeginningtodrop,advanceorders\narestartingtopickup,and\u2013thebestnewsofall\u2013theaverageincome\nfiguresareshowingagain.Thedoomsayershavebeendiscomfited,and\nthe free enterprise system once more vindicated.20\nHere, a number of distinct pieces of evidence are cited to\nsupport the proposition that America is recovering from the\ndepression: slowing of the inflation rate, stabilization of\nunemployment, increase in advance orders, and gain in average\nincome figures.\nAnexamplefromthefieldofliterarycriticismisthefollowing:\nThere can be no doubt that Emily Bronte cast a vague incestuous aura\nover the entire plot of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff marries his lost\nlove\u2019s sister-in-law; his wife\u2019s son marries her brother\u2019s daughter;\nCathy\u2019sdaughtermarriesherbrother\u2019sson.Anunconsciouslyincestuous\nlove between the two leading characters would not run counter to the\ntoneofanovelfilledwithviolentandsavagescenes,suchasthesadistic\nrubbing of awrist over a broken window pane, Cathy\u2019s fierce delirium,\nor the sight of Heathcliff smashing his bloody head against a tree.21\nHere, four separate premises are given to support the\nconclusions that there is an incestuous element in the novel:\nthreespecifyquasi-incestuousrelationships,andthefourthcites\notherviolence,claimingthatthesavagemoodofthenovelissuch\nthat incest would not be out of place. A conductive argument is\nused to support an interpretive claim.\nWe can also find examples of conductive arguments within\nphilosophy. Consider, for instance:\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 109 We found that either (a) the corresponding sense-datum is usually not\nidenticalwiththeobservedsurfaceoftheobjector(b)thecorresponding\nsense-datumusuallylacksthequalitiesitissensedashaving.For(1)the\nqualitieswhichitissensedashavingareusuallyincompatiblewiththe\nqualities of the surface: and (2) the qualities which different observers\nsensetheircorrespondingsense-dataashavingareusuallyincompatible\nwith one another.22\nThe conclusion is the disjunction of (a) and (b); statements\n(1) and (2) constitute separately relevant premises. That sensed\nqualities are usually incompatible with those on the surface of\nthe object and that sensed qualities, as sensed by different\nobservers, usually differ and are incompatible, are two distinct\nclaimsputforwardassupportfortheconclusion.Neitherentails\nit; both are conceptually relevant to it.\nAnother philosophical example, this time incorporating\ncounter considerations, is:\nThat \u2018this exists\u2019 has any meaning in such cases, where, as Mr. Russell\nwould say, we are using \u2018this\u2019 as a \u2018proper name\u2019 for something with\nwhich we are acquainted is, I know, disputed; my view that it has\ninvolves,Iamboundtoadmit,thecuriousconsequencethat\u2018thisexists\u2019\nwhen used in this way is always true, and \u2018this does not exist\u2019 always\nfalse; and I have little to say in its favor except that it seems to me so\nplainlytruethat,inthecaseofeverysense-datumIhave,itislogically\npossiblethatthesense-datuminquestionshouldnothaveexisted\u2013that\nthere shouldsimply have been no such thing.23\nThe conclusion is that \u2018this exists\u2019 has meaning. There is one\nmajor reason advanced for it: \u2018this\u2019 names a sense datum\n(understood as part of the background and context) and it is\nlogically possible that any particular sense datum should not\nhave existed. It is acknowledged that there are two points\ncounting against the conclusion. One is that \u2018this exists\u2019 will\nalways be true. The other is that \u2018this does not exist\u2019 will always\nbe false. The author (G.E. Moore) makes it clear that the single\npro factor outweighs the cons in his judgment. (He does not tell\nthe audience why he thinks this.) My point here is not that\n110TRUDYGOVIER Moore\u2019sargumentisagoodone,oreventhatitisaclearone.The\npoint is that it is a philosophical argument that is conductive in\ntype.\nI have noticed a tendency among beginning students in\npractical logic to approach arguments in a way which is\ninappropriate for standard deduction and induction. Students\noften seem to believe that the more premises an argument has,\nthe better it is. They find it almost impossible to believe that\na perfectly cogent argument may have only one premise.\nFurthermore, asked to assess the connection between premises\nand conclusion, they will often begin by looking at the premises\noneatatime,totrytodetermine,foreachpremise,whetheritis\nrelevanttotheconclusionandwhatsupportitmightoffer.Such\npreconceptions are often incorrect, but they are appropriate for\nconductive arguments. It is likely that their prevalence among\nbeginners is a kind of testimony to the presence, in ordinary\nargumentation, ofmanyconductiveargumentsinwhichvarious\nreasons are offered to support a claim.\nThere is a tendency in some philosophical circles to want to\nreduce conductive arguments to deductive ones. The standard\nstrategy is available here: we regard conductive arguments as\nbeing enthymematic. Wellman spends some time rejecting this\napproach and offers a splendid account. Briefly, the major\nobjection is that if we try to turn such an argument as \u2018you\nshould return the book because you promised to do so\u2019 into a\ndeductively valid argument, we will need an additional premise,\ndeemed, of course, to have been \u2018missing\u2019 in the original. But\ncandidate added premises will turn out to be either false,\nunverifiable independently of a judgement about the case in\nquestion,orimpossibletoformulateinadvance.Thatyoushould\nalways keep promises is false; that you should always keep\npromises other things being equal is unverifiable independently\nof a judgement about the case at issue; that you should always\nkeep promises in circumstances of type (abc) is impossible to\nformulate in advance. The enthymeme approach, here as so\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 111 often,makesaninferencewatertightatthecostofintroducingan\nunknowable premise. Wellman denies\nthat such reformulated arguments can be used to justify ethical\nconclusions in the way that their originals can. This is because one is\noftennotinapositiontojustifythepremisesthatmustbeaddedtomake\nthe arguments deductive in form. Since I believe that arguments really\ndo, at least in some cases, justify the conclusions drawn from them, I\nconclude that it is a mistake to try to save deductivim by trying to find\nadditional premises.24\nProposed additions are likely to distort the original argument,\nwhichistypicallynotputforwardasbeingconclusive,andmake\nthe merits of the argument impossible to determine. If one adds\napremisewithan\u2018otherthingsbeingequal\u2019clause,theninorder\nto determine whether this premise applies to the case at issue,\none will have to make a prior determination of the case. (Thus\nthe deductive reasoning is not what is providing the answer.) In\nacasewhereseveralpremisesappear,theproblemisevenworse,\nbecause one argument is turned into several, each \u2018conclusive\u2019\nfrom an inferential perspective and having an unknowable\npremise.\nLikeWisdom,Wellmaninsiststhatwecananddoreasonabout\nparticulars without relying on linking generalizations. Such a\nposition, though a minority one within philosophy, has a\nvenerable history, and was clearly put by Descartes. When\nDescartes introduced the Cogito, some critics argued that \u2018I\nthink therefore I am\u2019 was really a syllogism, with the missing\npremise \u2018Everything that thinks exists\u2019. Descartes denied it.25\nHewhosays,Ithink,henceIam,orexist,doesnotdeduceexistencefrom\nthoughtbyasyllogism,but,byasimpleactofmentalvision,recognises\nitasifitwereathingthatisknownperse.Thisisevidentfromthefact\nthatifitweresyllogisticallydeduced,themajorpremise,thateverything\nthatthinksis,orexists,wouldhavetobeknownpreviously;butyetthat\nhas rather been learned from the experience of the individual \u2013 that\n112TRUDYGOVIER unlessheexists,hecannotthink.Forourmindissoconstitutedbynature\nthat general propositions are formed out of the knowledge of particulars.\nInaletter,DescartesanticipatedsomeofWisdom\u2019sthemeswhen\nhe said:26\n...Butthegreatererrorhereisourcritic\u2019sassumptionthattheknowledge\nofparticulartruthsisalwaysdeducedfromtheuniversalpropositionsin\nconsonance with the order of the sequence observed in the syllogisms of\nthedialectic.Thisshowsthatheisbutlittleacquaintedwiththemethod\nby which truth should be investigated. For it is certain that in order\nto discover the truth we should always start with particular notions, in\norder to arrive at the general conceptions subsequently, though we may\nalso in the reverse way, after having discovered the universals, deduce\nother particulars from them.\nWhenDescartessaidthat\u2018everythingthatthinksexists\u2019would\nhavetobe\u2018learnedfromtheexperienceoftheindividual\u2019,hedid\nnotmeantosaythatthepremiseisempirical,butratherthatwe\nare able to know it because we have had insight, in one or more\nparticular cases, into the logical connection between thinking\nand existence. The idea that the universal may be known in and\nthrough the particular is also prominent in Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nknowledge.\nThere is no good reason for the belief that all particular\ninferences require supplementation with universal premises.\nSuch a view \u2018clarifies\u2019 arguments logically only by weakening\nthem epistemically. The logical structure in which a particular\ncase is resolved by being subsumed under a generalization is,\nindeed,simpleandlucid.Butitslogicalelegancemasksepistemic\nweakness: all too often that generalization is one we do not\nor cannot know. There is no sound basis for insisting that all\nconductiveargumentsberecastasdeductiveonesinwhichcited\nfactors are linked to the conclusion by supplementary universal\npremises.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 113 3.Cases, Relevance and Rules\nNeither conductive reasoning nor case-by-case reasoning is\nfullyamenabletotreatmentbygeneralrules.Perhapsitisforthis\nreasonthatthesekindsofreasoninghavebeensowidelyignored\nby logical and philosophical theorists. There seems little scope\nfor theory construction and research projects. So far, theorists\nhave done little more than make some rather general comments\nabout their appraisal. How much systematization is possible\nremains in doubt. Those who insist on general rules as a\npresumption of correct argumentation will find this situation\ndisturbing. These arguments quite certainly exist although the\nrulesthatareallegedlyrequireddonotseemto.Itisoftenalleged\nthat any judgment of merit \u2013 whether in the domain of logic\nor elsewhere \u2013 is based on a rule. With no rule, there can be\nno sound or unsound, no valid or invalid, no better or worse. If\nthat claim were true, we might have to admit that there can be\nno critical discrimination for a priori analogies and conductive\narguments. Their existence would make at best a negative\ncontribution to logic and epistemology.\nThere is a discussion of this view in Wellman\u2019s book.27 He\ncounters it by citing an independent basis for judgment as what\nis necessary for objective content and then remarking that there\nis at least some sense (a weak one) in which this condition can\nbemetinthecaseofargumentsforwhichtherearenogenerally\napplication rules of validity. That is, \u2018Argument A is sound\u2019 will\nadmitoftruthorfalsityifthereissomethingrelevanttoitstruth\napart from our believing in it. This condition can be met to\nsome extent, even in the absence of a general rule. If we think\nabout A and find its premises relevant to its conclusion, and\nsufficient for the truth of that conclusion, this does not itself\nguarantee that they are so. We have a way of checking up on\nwhether we are right. This is, on Wellman\u2019s account, to \u2018think\nit through again\u2019. Judicious and careful reflection on the matter\ncan make us change our mind. We do this and find it pertinent.\n114TRUDYGOVIER Wedosometimeschangeourminds,andwearesometimesquite\ncertain that we were right to do so.\nIsthisallthatcanbesaid?Perhapsnot.Theissuewillhingeon\ntwofurtherones:firstofall,whetherjudgmentsofrelevancecan\nbe rationally adjudicated, and secondly whether the \u2018weighing\nup\u2019 of factors is subject to any general principles of method. It\nhas been suggested that judgments of relevance can be tested by\nbringing factors to bear on other cases. (For instance, if equality\nof distribution counts for justice in consideration of property, it\nought similarly to do so in contexts of punishment or reward.)\nAnother possibility is that procedures might be sought for\nassessing the significance of pros and cons. These possibilities\nneed exploration. Wellman may not have taken this matter as\nfar as it can be taken. However, even if he is right about the\nlimitations of rules in contexts of conductive argument, this\nlimitation would not show either that the arguments fail to be a\ngenuine type or that they are never logically cogent.\nThe same can be said for analogies. We may find an analogy\nstriking and convincing and then, on reflection, spot a key\ndifference between the cases that is relevant to the point and\ndecidethattheanalogyisfaultyafterall.Orascrutinyoffurther\ncomparable cases may reveal the significance of other factors\nwe had not noticed at first. Such processes are not as elegant\nandperson-independentastheapplicationofaformalorgeneral\nrule, but it exists and is more than nothing.\nTheories of reflective equilibrium require that sometimes\njudgments about particulars have to stand as a check on rules.\nThisrequirementpresupposesthatthereissuchathingaslogical\nadequacyintheabsenceofrules.Toserveasacheckonarule,as\nmuch current theory in linguistics, science, and ethics requires,\na judgment about a particular case must have its own logical\ncredibility which is not dependent on a rule.\nForanumberofreasons,Wellmanrejectstheviewthatvalidity\nmust be formal and must be demonstrable by appeal to formal\nrules. Prominent among them is the ultimate dependence of\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 115 formal rules on nonformal, extrasystematic judgments of\nvalidity.28\n(S)urelytheexistenceofvalidreasoningdoesnotpresupposetheexistence\nofanysuchcalculusofderivationrules,fortheinferencesformalizedby\nHilbertandAckerman,say,werevalidbeforetheyinventedtheirlogical\nsystem,justasthesyllogismwasvalidlongbeforeAristotle.Asarule,the\nlogician tries to construct his calculus so that it will reflect some sort of\nreasoning that is recognized to be valid independently of his system. To\nbe sure, the inventive logician can think up queer logics which suggest\nnew,andsometimesstrange,waysofreasoning.Butifthesequeerlogics\nbecometooqueer,theyarenolongerconsideredlogics,butonlysymbolic\ngamesofsomesimilarsort.Thisindicatesthatevenhere,ourstandards\nof validity arc outside and independent of the derivation rules in any\nuninterpretedcalculus.\nThis kind of point has been strongly emphasized by such\ntheoristsofformallogicasArthurPapandSusanHaack.Validity\nis not by definition formal validity, and legitimate connections\nbetween premises and conclusions need not be formally\nappraisable in order to be real. The absence of formal, or even\ngeneral accounts does not rob critical judgments about such\narguments of all content.\nSuppose we were to have a background theory pertinent to a\nspecific argument. The theory might, for instance, include laws,\nprinciples, or rules explaining the relevance relations on which\nboth conductive and case-by-case reasoning ultimately depend.\nSurelysuchatheorywouldbeusefulinevaluatingtheargument.\nAshley and Shaw pressed this point of view in their article on\nanalogy, and it might be extended to conductive arguments as\nwell. It is not comfortable to be left insisting that something\njust is relevant and something else just is not relevant. To defend\nour judgments, we have to try to explain connections: a well-\nestablished theory would help to do that. Insofar as general\ntheories are obtainable, they can help to buttress these\narguments. Such background theories may be empirical,\nnormative, or conceptual; what matters is that they cover the\n116TRUDYGOVIER phenomenon in question, and be widely accepted and well-\nconfirmed.\nGrantingthisbelief,onemightbeinclinedtoseeanalogiesand\nconductive arguments as temporary crutches needed only in a\ntimeofincompleteknowledge.Thatseemstobethedirectionof\nAshley and Shaw\u2019s account. Analogies would not be necessary if\nwe had general knowledge about all the things that interest us.\nSince we don\u2019t, they are, according to these authors.\nI submit that such a view is not plausible. It ignores the\ndependence of theoretical principles on particulars.\nFurthermore, it neglects the key role of analogical reasoning in\nlanguage learning and use. No amount of theory could entirely\navoid the need for a priori analogical reasoning. To determine\nwhetheranewcaseshouldbesubsumedunderalaworprinciple\nof the theory we would have to compare and contrast that case\nwith others so subsumed. We would still create and learn\nlanguage by tacit assimilation of relevantly similar cases. We\nwould still seek consistency in logic, law, ethics, and\nadministration. Case-by-case reasoning is a key stage in\nestablishing theoretical principles and remains a key stage in\napplying these once they are established. It is not doomed to\nextinction by prospective all-encompassing theories.\nA similar point can be made about conductive argumentation.\nAllcurrentaccountsoftheoryacceptancespecifyseveraldistinct\nconditionsasrelevanttothemeritsoftheories.Ifempirical,they\nmust be well confirmed; they must have explanatory value; they\nmust be consistent with established theories; they must have\npredictivepower;theymustbesimple;theyshouldhaveresearch\npotential (be \u2018fruitful\u2019). Different philosophers of science vary\nthe list and have varying interpretations of what the items on it\nmean. But all agree that there is more than one item on that list.\nCompeting theories will almost always measure up differently\non different criteria. Thus an argument for the acceptance of\na theory is bound to be a conductive argument. Comparable\ncomments can be made about normative theories: there is more\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 117 than one desideratum and competing theories will satisfy these\ndifferently. For moral theory we want sensitivity to considered\njudgments; coherence; ready teachability; and ease of\napplication.\nMeta-theoretical arguments about the various merits of\ncompeting theories will be largely conductive. In addition, after\nnormative and empirical theories are accepted, novel cases not\nhandled by the theories are bound to arise. These will not be\nfully covered by existing principles, and we will have to deal\nwith them as best we can: by specifying various relevant factors\nand seeing how they add up, or by comparing and contrasting\nnew cases with standard ones. That means using conductive\nreasoning and defending our conclusions with conductive\narguments. No amount of theory is going to eliminate the need\nfor these.\nAs nondeductive, a priori, and particularistic ways of arguing,\na priori analogy and conduction are real and important. They\nare not about to disappear. I believe that much of what Wisdom\nand Wellman had to say is true. Their work gives us significant\nadditions to epistemology and the theory of argument.\nNotes\n1.

That is to say, premises said to be missing can too easily\nbe imported into an account to serve or save a favoured account. The\nstrategy enables ad hoc defenses of one or another interpretation, and\nshould be avoided.\nWith few exceptions (David Hitchcock is clearly one), scholars have\nbeen hesitant to seriously address the rather messy set of issues that\nconstitute the problem of missing premises. Which arguments have\nmissing premises? How do we know, or how should we judge, what\nthosemissingpremisesare?Andhowdoourresponsestothesequestions\ndepend on broader theories about argument typology? Argument\ninterpretation? Argument criticism? Not all assumptions amount to\nmissing premises, but how is the distinction between assumptions and\nmissing premises to be drawn? I think I can safely say that none of\nthese questions have been answered and few, if any, have been given\nsustained consideration.\nAs mentioned in this essay, various terms are used as roughly\nequivalent to \u201cmissing premises\u201d. These include \u201cimplicit premises\u201d,\n\u201cunstated premises\u201d, \u201chidden premises\u201d, and \u201cassumptions.\u201d I argue, and\nwould still maintain, that the term \u201cassumptions\u201d is too general and\nhence unsuitable as a substitute. But what about the others? It has\nbeen maintained (in a 1985 article by Jim Gough and Christopher\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 123 Tindale) that the term \u201chidden premises\u201d should be preferred, because\nthattermsuggeststhatthematerialtobeaddedispresentinadiscourse\nin a slightly disguised form; it is there to be found; it is not simply\nadded. I agree that one should carefully consider what is there before\nsupplementingwithsomethingthatisnotthere.Buttherearechallenges\nhidden in the notion of \u2018hiding\u2019. We can dispute as to whether the\nassociated conditional or a universalization of it is hidden in a\nsuccessionoftwoparticularclaims,justaswecandisputewhethersuch\nclaims aremissing.\nMore radical is a suggestion urged by Dan Levi in 1995: he argued\nthat the problem of missing premises emerges only because analysts\ninsist on setting out arguments in a premise-conclusion (PC) structure.\nThen, looking to their structure and finding it to be less than complete\nand clear, they sense that something is \u2018missing\u2019. If people following\nthis strategy \u2013 including of course myself \u2013 would employ a different\nmethod,shiftingawayfromPCmodels,theproblemofmissingpremises\nwould disappear. Avoiding the strategy of standardization, one would\npreserve relevant rhetorical aspects of context and voice, and these\naspects would assist in interpreting the argument. If one did not seek a\nPC structure, one would nothave toworry whether this or that version\nofitwascorrect.Thisradicalsuggestionwouldchallengemuchworkin\ninformal logic and does not seem to have been seriously pursued. It is\nsimilar in some respects to suggestions made later by Harald Wohlrapp\ninThe Concept of Argument.\nIn this chapter I challenge deductivism both as a theory and as\nprovidingaresponsetotheproblemofmissingpremises.Ialsoconsider\nhow the role of charity \u2014 the ways in which a commendable desire to\nbe polite and fair to an arguer \u2014 may lead us to rework that person\u2019s\nargument so as to make it fit with our own views. As I argue here,\ncharity can be taken too far. It needs to be qualified, and when it\nis, its implications for missing premises are altered. Whether it is a\ndeductivist lens or the generosity of charity, we tend to reconstruct\narguments to be clear and cogent in the ways we would like. The risk\nwe face is that this tendency will produce distortions; the fact that a\nreconstructedargumentstrikesusasclearandcogentdoesnotshowthat\n124TRUDYGOVIER theimprovementconstitutesanaccurateversionoftheoriginal.WhatI\ncall in this chapter \u2018strong charity\u2019 has been more recently discussed as\n\u2018steelmanning.\u2019 Steelmanning is the opposite of strawmanning: instead\nof addressing a weak version of an opposed position as in the straw\nman, one addresses what one takes tobe astrongversion ofanopposed\nposition. Among those who discuss steelmanning, many seem to favour\nit, but some object on the grounds that a person who purports to\nstrengthen a position may distort it and, in any event, displays\narrogance in presuming the ability to know best what the best opposed\nargument is.\nOnethingwhichmakespeopledifferastotheoryofargument\nand as to the analysis of particular arguments is different\napproachestothematterofmissingpremises.Forinstance,some\npeople insist that analogies all have a missing premise and that\nwhenthisisfilledin,theycanbeseentobedeductivearguments.\nOthersfindnoneedforsuchsupplementationandwouldregard\nanalogies as a distinct type.\nIn fact, the \u2018problem\u2019 of missing premises is too complex to be\njust one problem. There are a number of distinct problems. To\nbeginwith,wemustdistinguishthequestionofwhicharguments\nhave missing premises from the question of how to decide just\nwhich missing premises they have. In addition, there are several\ndifferent purposes for which people may examine arguments,\nand for different purposes, quite different approaches to\nreconstructionthroughtheadditionofpremisesareappropriate.\nOf course, premises are not the only thing that can be missing\nfrom arguments. Arguments may have unstated or missing\nconclusionsaswell.Thisislessoftendiscussedthantheproblem\nof missing premises, for it makes less difference to the overall\nstructure of the argument. It does, however, make an immense\ndifference to the classification of discourse as being\nargumentative or not. Often people write in an argumentative\ntone, in a context of controversy, indicating they are \u2018opposed\u2019\nto something, but do not state explicitly that the thing is wrong\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 125 or incorrect. Rather, they strongly imply it. Here, it seems\ninterpretivelyappropriatetoregardwhatissaidasanargument,\nthough the conclusion is not stated explicitly.l Those who are\ngenerous in adding premises and ungenerous in supplementing\nconclusions will find few fallacies in natural argumentation.\nThose who are ungenerous in adding premises and generous in\nadding conclusions will find many. We can see, then, how the\nmatter of missing conclusions has a significant effect on one\u2019s\noverall view of argument.\nThere are a number of different terms used as virtual\nsynonyms of \u2018missing premise\u2019. These include \u2018tacit premise\u2019,\n\u2018unstated premise\u2019, \u2018hidden premise\u2019, \u2018suppressed premise\u2019,\n\u2018implicit assumption\u2019, \u2018assumption\u2019, \u2018underlying assumption\u2019,\n\u2018suppressed assumption\u2019, and others. It is a serious mistake, I\nthink, to identify unstated premises with unstated assumptions.\nMany assumptions that are required for arguments to work are\nnot required to fill inference gaps-the standard role for missing\npremises.2 For this reason it is better to speak of missing or\nunstated premises rather than missing or unstated assumptions.\nAs to other variations in terminology, these do, to be sure, have\nnuances that could be exploited to good purpose and would\nbecomesignificant.Forinstance,tospeakofpremisesas\u2018hidden\u2019\nsuggests that the stated material contains good cues that these\npremises are endorsed by the arguer and contained in the text,\nthough not in the form of explicit statements.3 To say that they\nare \u2018missing\u2019 does not suggest those cues in the text, but does\nsuggest a strongly realist notion of interpretation. Here, these\nnuances are not exploited: the standard philosophical usage,\naccording to which \u2018unstated premise\u2019, \u2018missing premise\u2019,\n\u2018implicitpremise\u2019,\u2018tacitpremise\u2019,and\u2018hiddenpremise\u2019areusedas\nvirtual synonyms, is followed.\n1.Deductivismand Missing Premises\nDeductivism is the view that all good arguments are\ndeductively valid. Applied to the problem of missing premises,\n126TRUDYGOVIER deductivism yields the suggestion that an argument should be\nsupplemented with additional premises to the point where (as\nreconstructed) it becomes deductively valid. When thus\nreconstructed, it is a fully \u2018filled out\u2019 argument that can then\nbe subjected to critical scrutiny. Sometimes the added premises\nmake the argument a sound one, for they are true, and thus\nthe reconstructed argument is valid and has true premises.\nSometimes they show the argument to depend on unverifiable\npremises. And sometimes these added premises are false, or\nimplausible, and show the argument to be a poor one. On a\nstrong deductivist view, all arguments have, implicitly, all the\npremisesneededtomakethestatedpremisesandtheaddedones\nentail the conclusion. Criticism of an argument is not\nappropriate until these unstated premises have been filled in.\nThis is often an extensive task, to say the least.\nUnderstood in this way, deductivism has the curious\nconsequencethatlogicisrelevantsolelytothereconstructionof\nargumentsandnottotheirappraisal, oncereconstructed.When\nappropriately reconstructed, all arguments are logically equal\ninferentially, and all are logically good. The difference between\ncogent arguments and poor ones can only be found in the truth\nor plausibility of their premises.\nThe deductivist account will be natural and familiar to many\nreaders, and is often appealed to by philosophers \u2014 in both\ntheoretical and practical contexts. It is at work in many texts\non natural reasoning. Here we will look briefly at one such text,\nthat of Stephen Thomas. Thomas is interesting in this regard\nbecause his deductivist policy on missing premises is, in fact,\nincompatible with his broader theory of argument. That is a\nSpectrum Theory. The fact that Thomas lapses into this policy\nwhentryingtohandletheproblemisevidenceofthenaturalness\nand very great intuitive appeal of the deductivist approach.\nIn Practical Reasoning in Natural Language, Thomas goes into\nconsiderable detail telling students how to add premises to\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 127 arguments in order to render them deductively valid. He says\nthat when all these premises have been added, then:\nAny uncertainties about the truth of the final conclusion which were\ndue to inconclusive inferences in the original argument have now been\ndriven back onto the total set of basic reasons in the new constructed\nrevision. That is, all uncertainty about the inferences has been\neliminated(sinceallarenowironclad)anditremainsonlytodetermine\nwhether every member of the new set of basic reasons is true.4\n(The \u2018basic reasons\u2019 are the premises.) Once the missing\npremises, or premises deemed to have been missing, have been\nadded,theargumentisvalid.Itisvalidbecauseithasbeenmade\nvalid. We should note, as Thomas does, that it is always possible\nto make an argument deductively valid. One can sometimes do\nthis with significant and genuinely illuminating additions, as\nThomas points out. Failing this, we can do it with trivial and\nunilluminating additions, as he and a number of other analysts\nhave pointed out.\nThe simplest method for achieving deductive validity is to\nlink up all the stated premises to form a conjunction. Call this\nconjunction CON. Then, calling the conclusion C,\nsupplementing the original with the claim \u2018If CON, then C\u2019 will\nrender the argument deductively valid. The statement \u2018If CON\nthen C\u2019 may be called the associated conditional.5 Of course,\nthe associated conditional is not the only possibility here. Any\nstatement that entails the associated conditional will do equally\nwell. Another vacuous, but always available possibility is to the\nadd conclusion, or a generalization of it, as a missing premise.\nThis strategy will also make the argument deductively valid \u2014\nthough question-begging. Again, there are an indefinite number\nof possible variations on this move, for we could add any\nstatement which entailed the conclusion, in order to make the\nargument deductively valid.\nNaturally enough, Thomas now recommends premise\n128TRUDYGOVIER assessment as the next (and only possible) stage of argument\ncriticism.\nOnlyifoneormoreofthemisfalsecantheargument\u2019sfinalconclusion\nbe false. If all the basic reasons in the revised argument (i.e., original\nplusnewreasons)aretrue,thensotooistheargument\u2019sfinalconclusion.\nSo if you know that all the basic reasons are true, then you know that\nthe conclusion is also true. But if a falsehood arises in every possible\nsetofsuppressedassumptionswhoseadditionwouldcreateadeductively\nvalidexpansionoftheoriginalargument,thentheoriginalargumentis\nunsound.6\nThe emphasis is added here to indicate the link, in Thomas\u2019\nanalysis, between deductivism as a solution to the problem of\nmissingpremisesanddeductivismasatheoryofargument.This\nis an unqualified deductivist view.\nThomas supposes that the premises needed to make the\noriginal argument deductively valid are somehow part of the\noriginal argument and that their evaluation is pertinent to the\nevaluation of the original argument.7 Nondeductivists would\ndeny this. Consider, for instance, the case of analogy. If we add\nto an argument by analogy sufficient premises to make that\nargumentdeductivelyvalid,thoseaddedpremisesmayverywell\nbe seen by a critic going beyond the original premises. If the\naddedpremisesturnouttobefalseorunacceptable,thatwillnot\n(at least, not in the eyes of the non-deductivist critic) indicate\nthat the original argument was at fault. On the critic\u2019s view, the\noriginal argument was not deductive. The fact that a premise\nneeded to make it deductively valid turns out to be a false\npremise shows nothing about the merits of the original\nargument.\nThomas is committed to disagreeing with such a position: he\ninsists that when the added premises are false, the original\nargument is shown to be unsound. This indicates that he thinks\nof the original argument as having really depended on these\nclaims;althoughtheywerenotstated,theyarenecessarytomake\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 129 the argument work. But making it work means making it work\nas a deductively valid argument. Since the account is applied to\nall arguments, without qualification, we can only suppose that\nThomas holds that for an argument to work, the premises have\ngot to entail the conclusion. This stance is, of course, that of\ndeductivism.Therelevanceofthesupplementedpremisestothe\ncritique of the original, unreconstructed argument presupposes\nthat whatever sort of argument the original seemed to be, it was\nactually an aspiring deduction which, as stated, didn\u2019t pass the\n(deductive) test. If this theoretical presumption were false, the\nfalsity(orunverifiability,orimplausibility)oftheaddedpremises\nwould show nothing about the original argument.\nAnother significant feature of this account is Thomas\u2019 claim\nthatonlyifoneormorepremisesintheargumentisfalsecanwe\nregardtheoriginalargumentasunsound.Theoriginalargument\nwill be unsound only if \u2018a falsehood arises in every possible set\nof suppressed assumptions whose addition would create a\ndeductively valid expansion of the original argument\u2019. The\nproblem is that there is an indefinitely large number of ways\nof expanding a stated argument so as to produce a deductively\nvalidargument.(Thisresultisobviousevenfromthepossibilities\ngenerated by the trivial associated conditional and \u2018add the\nconclusion\u2019strategiesdescribedearlier.Ofcoursetherearemany\nother devices which can be employed.) Given this fact, it is hard\nto see how we could ever be in a position to assert with\nconfidence that a falsehood will arise in every possible set of\nsupplementary premises. Thomas seems to be aware of the\ndifficulty, because he says:\nForpracticalpurposes,youcantakethistomeanthatifeveryreasonable\nattempt to supply the argument\u2019s suppressed assumptions requires the\naddition of some falsehood, then for all intents and purposes, you may\nregard the original argument as unsound.8\nThis position is neither practically satisfactory nor theoretically\nadequate.\n130TRUDYGOVIER Anunqualifieddeductivistpolicyonmissingpremiseslicenses\noverabundant expansion of arguments. One way in which it is\noverabundantisthatitraisestheprospectofallargumentswhich\nare not, as stated, deductively valid, being enthymemes \u2014 a\ncounterintuitive prospect, to put it mildly. On this view, there\nare no fallacies (formal or informal), no enumerative inductions\n(hasty or otherwise), no analogies, no inferences to the best\nexplanation, and so on. This is a counterintuitive result which\nruns contrary to established traditions in logic and to recent\nwork in the philosophy of science. 9 Another way in which\nunqualified deductivism is overabundant is that it licenses an\nindefinitely large number of expansions for each argument.\nFindingaflawinanyoneofthesewillnotconstituteadefinitive\ncriticism of the original argument, for there are always many\nalternative reconstructions remaining to be considered; on\npurelydeductivistgrounds,thesereconstructionsareallofequal\nmerit.Thusdeductivismbyitselfcannotprovideacompleteand\nadequatepolicyonmissingpremises.Itmustbequalifiedsoasto\napply only to some arguments and supplemented so that not all\ndeductivist reconstructions are of equal critical relevance. Later\nwe will consider what some of the appropriate qualifications\nmight be.\nTheproblemswithadeductivistapproachtomissingpremises\nappear in a more concrete guise when we consider specific\nexamples. First, let us look at an example of a poor argument,\nandseehowadeductivistpolicyonmissingpremiseswilladvise\nus to reconstruct it. As an example, here is a short argument of\nGarret Hardin\u2019s on sterilization.10\nIt should be easy to limit a woman\u2019s reproduction by sterilizing her at\nthebirthofhernthchild.Isthisashockingidea?Ifso,trythis\u2018thought\nexperiment\u2019: let n equal 20. Since this is not shocking, let n diminish\nuntil population control is achievable.\nHere Hardin argues from the premise that it would be tolerable\nto sterilize a woman after her twentieth child to the conclusion\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 131 thatitwouldbetolerabletosterilizeawomanatwhateverpoint\nwas necessary in order to achieve population control. The\nargument appears to be an outright fallacy of a rather original\nkind.11 (Is it some kind of reverse slippery slope?) And yet the\ninferencefrompermissibilityintheonecontexttopermissibility\nin the other seems simply mistaken: there is an enormous, and\nmorally significant, difference between them. We can add\npremises which will fill the gap in various ways. Three\npossibilities are:\n3. If it is permissible to sterilize a woman after her twentieth\nchild,thenitispermissibletosterilizeheratwhateverpoint\nis necessary in order to achieve population control.\nor\n4. If it is permissible to perform an operation on a woman\nin an extreme case, then it is permissible to perform that\noperation on a woman in a less extreme, but socially\nsignificant, case.\nor\n5. Whenever it is permissible to do anything in an extreme\ncase, then it is permissible to do that same thing in a less\nextreme, but socially significant, case.\n(3)willsufficetomaketheargumentdeductivelyvalid.However,\nthis is a redundant and useless addition, because (3) is the\nassociated conditional, which simply reiterates the original\nargument. If we can assess (3), we can assess the original\nargument directly and have no need of (3).\nTheotheradditionsarenotpurelyreiterative.However,unlike\n(3) they may not by themselves suffice to make the argument\ndeductively valid. They are generalizations on the associated\nconditional,andwehavetograntthatthegeneralizationisdone\nappropriately.This,for(4),meansgrantingthatsterilizationisan\noperation;thatsterilizingawomanaftershehashad20children\n132TRUDYGOVIER issterilizingherinanextremecase;andthatsterilizingawoman\nat whatever point is necessary to achieve population control is\nsterilizing her at a socially significant, but non-extreme, point.\nSimilar points arise for (5). More importantly, (4) and (5) go\nconsiderablybeyondtheoriginalargumentinscope.Itisperhaps\nnot fair to commit the unhappy author to these sweeping\npremises, which are so much more easily attacked even than\nhis original inference. The generalizations on the associated\nconditional have the critical virtue of non-redundancy. But they\ncan be critically useful only insofar as they open the door to\nconsiderations which are not exactly what would be called for\nby the original inference. There is, then, some critical benefit\nfromaddingthesemoregeneralpremises.Butexactlythefeature\nwhich makes them appear critically useful makes them\ninterpretively questionable.12\nAnother example reveals further peculiar problems. Consider\nthe following brief passage from Stephen Toulmin and June\nGoodfield\u2019s The Architecture of Matter. Toulmin and Goodfield\nreport describing to a colleague who commented on Voltaire\u2019s\nefforts to weigh fire. They asked their colleague how he would\nhave persuaded Voltaire that experiments directed toward the\nweighing of fire were useless. The man replied lightly that he\nshould have told Voltaire to use his common sense. Of this\nresponse, Toulmin and Goodfield comment:\nThecommonsenseofVoltaire\u2019stimewasnot,andcouldnothavebeen,\nidenticalwiththecommonsenseofourownperiod.ForLavoisierhelped\nto create our contemporary common-sense ideas about matter, just as\nNewton,earlier,hadhelpedtoestablishourcommon-sensepictureofthe\nplanetarysystem.If,inretrospect,itseemstooobviousthatfireisnota\nsubstance, we should regard this \u2018obviousness\u2019 with grave suspicion.13\nHere,wehaveasubargumentandthenanargument,bothwitha\nsingle stated premise and conclusion:\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 133 1. Lavoisierhelpedtocreateourcontemporarycommon-sense\nideas about matter.\n2. Thecommon-senseofVoltaire\u2019stimewasnotidenticalwith\nthe common-sense of our own time.\n3. The \u2018obviousness\u2019 of the idea that fire is not a substance\nshould be regarded with suspicion.\nNeitherthesubargument from(1)to(2),northemainargument\nfrom (2) to (3) is deductively valid as it stands. We have seen,\nabove, that there are certain problems which arise when the\nassociated conditional or generalizations of it are used as\nsupplementary premises. We shall approach the Toulmin and\nGoodfield example in another way, then, by trying to add\npremises which will make the argument deductively valid and\nwhichareneither theassociated conditional norgeneralizations\nof it. Some natural and plausible additions, which would appear\nnecessary whether one was a deductivist or not, are:\n4. Lavoisier had not yet created our contemporary common-sense in\nVoltaire\u2019s time.\n5. What seems obvious depends upon our common-sense.\n6. Common-sensethatcanfluctuatefromonetimetoanother\nshould be regarded with suspicion.\nBut still, (1) and (4) do not entail (2); (2) and (5) and (6)\ndo not entail (3). We need more additions yet. For the\nsubargument, for instance, we need:\n7. No two sets of common-sense beliefs are identical unless\nthey are created at the same time.\n8. Thecommon-senseofVoltaire\u2019stimehadbeencreatedathis\ntime.\nEven this may not be sufficient.\n134TRUDYGOVIER When we do not revert to the associated conditional or a\ngeneralization of it, the necessary additions start to seem\nindefinitely many and excruciatingly pedantic. A\n\u2018reconstruction\u2019 of two very simple arguments which has seven\nor more supplementary premises is a critical and pedagogic\nmonster.Arethesepremisesreally\u2018there\u2019,unstated,becausethey\nare \u2018needed\u2019 in order to make the original inferences work in a\ndeductive sense of \u2018work\u2019?\nThese examples indicate that deductivism does not always\nmake for easy and elegant criticism. It is not always\ninterpretively plausible, and it can be cumbersome in practice.\nReiterative addition of the associated conditional is simple and\nalways applicable; however it is a critically redundant\nmanoeuvre. Generalizations of the associated conditional are\nnot by themselves sufficient without further premises spelling\nout the \u2018assumption\u2019 that the generalization is an appropriate\none. It may be interpretively incorrect to attribute the\ngeneralization to the arguer. If the arguer is not committed by\nthe original argument to that generalization, then any analysis\nof that argument via a reconstruction with the generalization\nas a missing premise will be misdirected. In addition, attempts\nto make some arguments deductively valid will be cumbersome\nwhen they avoid the associated generalization and its\nconditional \u2013 as some deductivists have, themselves, admitted.\nBut in so many contexts, and to so many people, deductivist\ninstincts on missing premises seem correct. The above account\nwill doubtless not dissuade convinced deductivists. Why is this\napproach to missing premises so appealing to so many people,\ndespite its running counter to strong theoretical traditions in\nlogicandtoeconomyincriticismandanalysis?Thereseemtobe\nat least two plausible explanations.\nFirstofall,thedeductivist reconstruction ofanargument will\noften be straightforward and elegant. It will make sense. It will\nprovide a model in which the stated premises, together with\notherclaims,leadinadirectlogicalwaytothestatedconclusion.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 135 The model will be alogicallyclear and coherent argument, even\nthough some of the premises of that argument may be\ndisputable. Such an argument has definite logical appeal; its\nappealing character may make it seem an excellent substitute\nfor the original argument, which lacked such logical coherence\nand structure. Given all this, it is easy to confuse two issues:\nthe real issue of whether the model is an accurate rendition of\nthe original argument and the quite distinct issue of whether\nthe reconstructed model is a logically \u2018virtuous\u2019 argument. The\nsecond matter is guaranteed in the nature of the case. The first\nis something else entirely. It is one thing for a reconstructed\nargumenttobeclearandanotherforittobethecorrect(oreven\na correct) model of a stated argument.\nWeshouldnotletthelogicalappealofareconstructionleadus,\nby itself, to the belief that the reconstruction accurately reflects\nan original. The beauty of a portrait does not show that it\naccurately represents its subject. There is perhaps a tendency to\nconfuse the clarity of the reconstruction considered on its own\nterms with its interpretive accuracy as a plausible version of the\noriginal argument.\nSecondly, the following line of reasoning is tempting: If a\nperson argues for a conclusion, C, then provided that he or she is\narguingsincerely,heorshebelievesCtobetrue.Ifthatpersonbelieves\nCtobetrue,thenheorshemustbelieveasetofclaimswhichentailsC.\nThus,ifthearguer\u2019sstatedpremisesdonotentailC,itisappropriateto\nsupplement them to the point where they do entailC.\nTheproblemwiththisaccountcomesinthesecondstatement.\nFirst of all, the \u2018must\u2019 is ambiguous as between a psychological\nand a logical must. Interpreting \u2018must\u2019 as psychological, the\nstatement is false, because people often believe claims with no\nsupport or with some partial support, or on fallacious grounds,\nas a matter of psychological fact. Also, psychologically\ninterpreted the claim could require a vicious infinite regress\nof beliefs. The logical interpretation of the \u2018must\u2019 makes the\nstatement somewhat more plausible. The claim would then\n136TRUDYGOVIER amount to the insistence that anyone who believes a conclusion\nC is logically committed to some set or other of claims which\nentailsC.Onthisview,ifwetakeanargumentwhichthatperson\nputsforwardforCandwereadintoitenoughpremisestomake\nthe stated premises, together with the new ones, entail C, we\nwill not go beyond anything to which that arguer is not already\ncommitted.\nOn this interpretation, the claim amounts to an especially\nstrongversionoffoundationalism.Itisopentoallthecriticisms\nwhich can be made of traditional foundationalism, and more\nbesides.14 Furthermore, even if it were true that anyone who\nbelieves C is committed to some set of claims that entails C,\ngiven that the number of such sets is indefinitely large, the\nconnection between this set and the one generated by a logician\nreconstructing the original argument is likely to be remote.\nThus, deductivism cannot offer a complete and satisfactory\npolicy on missing premises. The intuitive appeal of the policy\ndisappears when we look more closely at theory and practice\nandwhenweexaminesomeoftheaccountswhichmayunderlie\nthose intuitions. To add to arguments all premises necessary\nto make those arguments deductively valid and regard these\nadditions as premises which were missing in the\nunreconstructed version of the argument is not, in general, a\nreasonable thing to do.\nIt may be suggested that a deductivist approach to missing\npremisescanbeendorsed,intheinterestsofclarityandelegance,\nwithout any commitment to a deductivist theory of argument.\nDavid Hitchcock has taken this approach, which he regards as a\nkind of heuristic deductivism. But there are two problems with\nthis approach. First of all, it is hard to give a good reason for\nseekingtoreconstructanargumentsoastorenderitdeductively\nvalid, if one does not endorse a deductivist theory of argument.\nWe can find a missing premise, or gap-filler, such that, if it is\nadded, the resulting argument becomes deductively valid. But\nif someone asks, why should we want to render this argument\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 137 deductively valid, no answer will be forthcoming. Secondly, as\nindicated here, deductivism does not in fact generate an elegant\nsolution to the problem of missing premises.15\nThe story is different so far as missing conclusions are\nconcerned. If an arguer has stated several claims and there is\ngood reason to interpret these claims as premises in an\nargument, then there is never any problem about \u2018reading in\u2019\na statement which is, in fact, entailed by those claims. Anyone\nwho does so will attribute to an arguer no more than he or she\nis already logically committed to. We are not committed to all\nclaims which entail beliefs we hold, but we are committed to all\nclaims which are entailed by beliefs we hold.\nSuppose that an advertisement reads as follows:\nThe bigger the burger, the better the burger. The burgers are bigger at\nBurger King\nWecanjustifyaddingtheunstatedconclusionthattheburgers\nare better at Burger King. The entailed claim can appropriately\nbe regarded as a conclusion that is supported by the stated\nmaterial. There is good reason for taking advertisements of this\ntype as arguments. Sometimes there are problems about\ninterpreting passages as arguments, and the issue of whether to\nadd a conclusion which is not stated but is entailed or suggested\nis linked to this interpretive issue. Whether a person is trying\nto prove a point or is rather merely giving a description,\nexplanation,illustration,orcommentisoftenamootpoint.This\ninterpretive problem can make the addition of conclusions\nquestionable in some contexts. But in general, it seems a more\nmanageable problem than the problem of missing premises, and\na deductivist approach to it will always give results within\nreasonable interpretive bounds.16\n2. Missing Premises and Assumptions\nOften the problem of missing premises is thought to be a\nproblem about assumptions. The idea is something like this:\n138TRUDYGOVIER when people present arguments, they do not always mention\nall of the beliefs which they hold which are pertinent unstated\nclaims, the truth of which is a necessary condition of the\nargument\u2019s working the way it should. People could not state\neverything pertinent to the argument in this way. They\nnecessarily leave much unstated. Often unstated assumptions\nwouldbeacceptedbyvirtuallyeveryone,anditwouldbeagreat\nbore for the arguer and the audience to spell them out.\nSometimesarguersarenotawareoftheirunstatedassumptions;\nsometimes these assumptions are highly questionable, and\nneglecting to spell them out lulls the unwary audience into\nacceptingthingsitwouldnothavegrantedoncriticalscrutiny.17\nIt is often said that such unstated assumptions are the missing\npremises of the stated argument.\nA statement of this view appears in Irving Copi\u2019s Symbolic\nLogic,in a discussion of the logic of relations:\nRelational arguments are often used, and many of them depend\nessentiallyonthetransitivity,orsymmetry,oroneoftheotherproperties\nof the relations involved. But that the relation in question has the\nrelevantpropertyisseldom\u2013ifever\u2013statedexplicitlyasapremise.The\nreason is easy to see. In most discussions a large body of propositions\ncan be presumed to be common knowledge. The majority of speakers\nand writers save themselves trouble by not repeating well-known and\nperhaps trivially true propositions that their hearers or readers can\nperfectlywellbeexpectedtosupplyforthemselves.Anargumentwhichis\nincompletelyexpressed,partofitbeing\u2018understood\u2019,isanenthymeme.18\nIt is clearly true, as Copi says, that in most discussions many\npropositions are presumed true, as common knowledge.\nDiscussion would be completely impossible without such\npresumptions. But whether all such presumptions should be\ncounted as assumptions that amount to missing premises and\nall arguments depending on them should be regarded as\nenthymemes, are further questions.\nIn On Certainty, Wittgenstein argued that in order for some\nproblems to be discussed and considered, many other aspects\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 139 of life and language must be accepted as givens. In a specific\ncontext, someone might wonder whether his hand is made of\nreal human flesh. (Perhaps someone had a hand transplant and\ncannot remember whether it was the left or the right \u2014 my\nexample.) But to contemplate even such a radical question, a\nperson must nevertheless take for granted other aspects of\nmundane life-such as knowing what \u2018hand\u2019, \u2018flesh\u2019, and \u2018human\u2019\nmean. On Certainty gives us a sustained elaboration of the fact\nthat we cannot question everything at once. Questions and\nproblems require a background.\nThatistosay,thequestionsthatweraiseandourdoubtsdependonthe\nfact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are, as it were, like\nhinges on which those turn\n..itbelongstothelogicofourscientificinvestigationsthatcertainthings\nare indeed not doubted.\nBut it isn\u2019t that the situation is like this: We just can\u2019t investigate\neverything, and for that reason we are forced to rest content with\nassumptions. If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put.19\nThis view of the background of questions can be applied\ndirectly to the case of arguments. A person who presents an\nargumentputsforwardreasonstosupporthisconclusion,trying\nto raise the credibility of that conclusion to an audience he is\naddressing. The argument can be seen as aimed towards its\nconclusion, and as attempting to resolve a particular question-\nwhether that conclusion is true. In the context, the question is\nopen.20 This question, like others, will make sense only against\nan assumed background of beliefs and practices.\nWhat is wrong with Copi\u2019s account is not his claim that\ndiscussion requires assumptions, but the conflation of such\nassumptions with missing premises. Copi is following logical\ntradition when he says that if part of an argument is missing,\nthat argument is an enthymeme. But the parts of an argument,\naccording to logical tradition, are its premises and conclusion.\n140TRUDYGOVIER Thus an enthymematic argument is one in which one or more\npremises, or the conclusion, is not stated. So far, so good. But\nlogical tradition also has it that there exist non-enthymematic\narguments.Thisisanelementofthetraditionworthpreserving,\nif \u2018enthymeme\u2019 is to play a useful role in the classification,\nunderstanding, and criticism of arguments. If unstated\nassumptions and missing premises are identified, then every\nargument will be an enthymeme, because it is clearly true, as\nCopi says, that in every argumentative discussion there are\nunmentioned presumptions on which the arguer and his or her\naudience agree.\nMissing premises constitute a subset of these unstated\nassumptions, not the whole set. One important first step in\nresolving the problem of missing premises is to distinguish\nbetween those assumptions that are required by the argument\nbut are not missing premises, and those assumptions that do\namount to missing premises. There are many ways in which an\nargument may be based on an assumption, A. These include at\nleast the following:\n1. The truth of A may be a necessary condition for the terms\nused in the argument to have a referent.\n2. The truth of A may be a necessary condition for the subject\nof the argument to be of interest to anyone.\n3. The truth of A may be a necessary condition for the\nmeaningfulness of any language.\n4. The truth of A may be a necessary condition for properly\ninferring the conclusion from the stated premises.\n5. The truth of A may be a necessary condition for the\nappropriacyofthemethodologyusedbythearguerwhenhe\nor she cites the premises as support for the conclusion.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 141 6. ThetruthofAmaybeanecessaryconditionforthetruthof\none of the stated premises.\n7. ThetruthofAmaybeanecessaryconditionforwordsused\nin stating the premises and conclusion to have the meaning\nwhich they do have, and on which proper understanding of\nthe argument depends.\nTo make matters worse, these do not exhaust the possibilities. If\nwethinkofmissingpremisesaspremisesthatshouldbeaddedin\norder to make the inferences of the stated argument work, then\nat most assumptions of the type in (4) and (5) would qualify as\nmissing premises. (As we shall see later when discussing Lewis\nCarroll\u2019sargument,level(5)assumptionsshouldnotberegarded\nas premises.) Copi\u2019s account seems to require that all\nassumptions pertinent to the workings of an argument be\nincorporated within that argument as premises. This would\nmake even short arguments indefinitely long when they were\ncompletely \u2018filled out\u2019.\nThat this is really what Copi means is confirmed by his\ndiscussion of an example from the logic of relations. After the\npassage quoted earlier, he goes on to say:\nInmostcasesthereisnodifficultyinsupplyingthetacitpremisesthatthe\nspeakerintendedbutdidnotexpress.Thus,thefirstspecimenargument\nstated at the beginning of this chapter:\nAl is older than Bill.\nBill is older than Charlie.\nTherefore, Al is older than Charlie.\nought to be counted as valid, since it becomes so when the trivially true\nproposition that \u2018being older than\u2019 is a transitive relation is added as\nanauxiliarypremise.Whentheindicatedmissingpremiseissupplied,a\nformal proof of the argument\u2019s validity is very easily set down.21\nBut this must be wrong. The argument which, according to\nCopi, has the missing premise \u2018Being older than\u2019 is a transitive\nrelation\u2019isinfact,deductivelyvalidasstated.Copi\u2019saccountgoes\n142TRUDYGOVIER beyond deductivism in that he seeks to make the argument not\njustdeductivelyvalid,butdeductivelyvalidinvirtueofitsformas\nidentified within a specific system of logic. The stated premises\ndo entail the stated conclusion. It is just not formally provable\nthat this is the case. One can formally derive the conclusion\nfromthepremises,giventheapparatusdevelopedtothatpointin\nCopi\u2019s book, if one adds the auxiliary premise.\nThe proposed auxiliary premise is meta-linguistic. But other\nmetalinguistic premises are also \u2018assumed\u2019 in the argument Copi\ndiscusses. For instance, the argument \u2018assumes\u2019 that \u2018Al\u2019 can be\nused to name something that has an age, and that \u2018Al\u2019 names\nthe same entity in the conclusion as in the first premise. These\nmeta-linguistic assumptions are essential to the workings of the\nargument. If the first did not hold, the first premise and the\nconclusionwouldbemeaningless.Iftheseconddidnothold,the\npremises would not be relevant to the conclusion. If we follow\nCopi in adding one meta-linguistic premise and insisting it was\n\u2018missing\u2019fromtheoriginalargument,whyshouldwestopatone?\nThat language and concepts work is \u2018assumed\u2019 by every\nargument. If all the pertinent workings need to be spelled out in\nauxiliary premises, even the smallest, clearest arguments will be\nenthymemes that have to be filled out in an highly cumbersome\nway. Following through on the demand that meta-linguistic\nassumptionsbeincorporatedaspremiseswillleadustoavicious\ninfiniteregress.Thesupplementedargumentswillusenewterms\nandpremisesspellingoutassumptionsrequisitetothesewillalso\nneed to be added, and so on.\nCopi is quite entitled to add a premise for some specific\npurpose, but he is not entitled to regard the original argument\nas an enthymeme solely because this can be done. The policy\nof adding meta-linguistic premises because what they say is\n\u2018assumed\u2019 is not a constructive one. Missing premises are a\nsubset of the unstated assumptions behind an argument. The\nproblem is to specify what that subset is.\nThereisanunfortunatetendencytouse\u2018missingpremise\u2019and\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 143 \u2018missing assumption\u2019 virtually as synonyms. This can be seen in\nMichael Scriven\u2019s early work at one point. Scriven advises that\n\u2018inassumptionhuntingyou\u2019retryingtoreconstructthepremises\nthatsomeonewouldhaveputforwardifstatingtheargumentin\nfull. He continues as follows:\nThe requirement that the extra or \u2018missing\u2019 premise (which is what\nan assumption is) be new immediately precludes a mere repetition of\nthe supposed connection between the given premises and the required\nconclusion. There\u2019s nothing new about the statement that what is\nalready being provided is supposed togive support towhat is alleged to\nbe the conclusion of the argument. So, typically, an assumption should\nbe referring to something else that hasn\u2019t been mentioned in the given\npremises.22\nThe same sort of thing occurs in the first edition of Johnson\nand Blair\u2019s Logical Self-Defense. The authors begin their\ndiscussion of missing premises by saying that a missing premise\nis a proposition which, though unstated in an argument, is\nneeded in order to link the stated premises with the stated\nconclusion. Later they say that a missing premise is necessary\nfor the intelligibility of the argument, and may be called an\nassumption.23 They seem to have decided that this equivalence\nwas a mistake, because the second edition of the work says\ninstead that missing premises are one type of assumption.24\nNot all assumptions underlying an argument are its missing\npremises. There are assumptions that must hold if one argues\nabout anything (general pragmatic assumptions), assumptions\nthat must hold if anyone is to argue about this particular thing\n(specific pragmatic assumptions), meta-linguistic propositions\nabout the meaning and appropriate use of words used to state\nthe argument, evidence which would support stated premises,\nandmuchelse.Noneoftheseassumptionsareproperlyregarded\nas missing premises.\nMissing premises are to fill a quite specific role, one not filled\nby these kinds of assumptions. As Robert Ennis argued in an\n144TRUDYGOVIER important paper, they are to fill a \u2018gap\u2019 identified in the stated\nargument.25 The gap is an inference gap, and is deemed by the\ncritictoarisebecausethestatedpremisesdonot,bythemselves,\nlead to the stated conclusion in the appropriate way. If we have\ninterpreted a passage as containing an argument, and we are\nsure that that argument is supposed to work as a syllogism, we\nwill easily be able to supply the appropriate missing premise.26\nIf we have interpreted it as a passage containing an argument\nand we are sure that the argument is supposed to work as a\nformally valid propositional argument, again we can supply the\nappropriate missing premise.27 In both cases, inserting the\nmissing premise presupposes the interpretive judgments, and\nonce these are made, we apply a familiar model to generate a\nmissingpremise.Wehaveatheoryofargumentthattellsusthat\nthemodelisofatypeofargumentwhichexistsandislegitimate,\nandwehaveinterpretedthepassageinquestionascontainingan\nargumentofthissort.Thetheoryofargument,andconsiderable\ninterpretationarepresupposedtogiveasolutiontotheproblem\nof missing premises.\nOnedifficultywithdeductivismisthatthetheoryofargument\nandthepolicyonmissingpremisesaretoointimatelyrelated.In\norder to maintain deductivism, we need to apply a deductivist\npolicy on missing premises practically everywhere. Yet there\nseems no rationale for such a policy save in deductivism itself.\nThedeductivistapproachtointerpretationthusseemsquestion-\nbegging and self-serving or, to put it another way, tooad hoc.\nIwouldsay,withEnnis,thatargumentshavemissingpremises\nwhen they have inference \u2018gaps\u2019. These gaps are identified when\nwe apply our theory of argument and canons of interpretation\nto the discourse in which the argument appears. If we see the\nargument as an inference to the best explanation, and we\nunderstandthatkindofargumentasoneinwhichtheinferential\npatternmustgoinsuch-and-suchway,thenwhentheargument\nfails to exemplify the appropriate pattern, it will have a \u2018gap\u2019.\nSomething will be missing, and we can make this something\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 145 appear by adding a premise. Clearly, perceiving these gaps is\ntantamounttoperceivingsomeinferencesasinadequate.28This\nperception depends on our perception of how the inference is\nworking in the stated argument, which is a matter of\ninterpretation. It also depends on our view of how it should\nwork, to yield an argument without \u2018gaps\u2019. This is a matter of\nlogic. This issue explicitly reveals the need for a theory of\nargument,forourviewwilldependonourviewastohowmany\ntypes of good inference there are.\nThat missing premises fill gaps in arguments does not yet tell\nus which of several possible gap-fillers should be selected as\n\u2018best\u2019. One problem about missing premises is to apply a theory\nof argument and to interpret a discourse and generate the\njudgment that there is an argument there with a missing\npremise. Another is, given different candidate statements which\nwouldallfilltheidentifiedgap,toselectoneofthemasthemost\nappropriate gap filler. Even when we limit the role of missing\npremises to that of filling inference gaps, there is considerable\nroomfordisagreementaboutthem.Somepeopleseegapswhere\nothersdon\u2019t,duetodisagreementsaboutthetheoryofargument.\nAnd some people see gaps where others do not because of\ndisagreementsabouttheexplicitnessorimplicitnessofinference\nrules. All this has only to do with the first question of whether\na gap exists. Needless to say, there is also disagreement about\nthesecondproblem,thatofselectionofcandidatefillersfroman\narrayofpossibleonesoncewehavegrantedthatthereisagapto\nbe filled at all.\nOn the matter of premises and inference rules the locus\nclassicus is, of course, Lewis Carroll\u2019s famous dialogue about\nAchilles and the Tortoise. The stubborn Tortoise shows us the\npossibility of finding inference gaps in even the most\nstraightforward modus ponens reasoning.29 This meticulous\ncharacter insists that in reasoning \u2018A and B; If A and B, then Z;\nTherefore, Z.\u2019, we \u2018assume\u2019 that if A and B, and if A and B, then\nZ, then Z. He insists that the \u2018assumption\u2019 be written into the\n146TRUDYGOVIER argument, since the shorter version required the \u2018assumption\u2019.\nBut then his lengthened argument requires a comparable, but\nlonger assumption, in the form of a new associated conditional.\nThe same problem arises at every stage; it repeats. The dialogue\nshows that inference is impossible unless the mind is willing\nto move from some claims to others according to a rule which\nis not \u2018written in\u2019. That is, principles of inference according to\nwhich inferences are made cannot, on pain of a vicious infinite\nregress,bewrittenintotheargumentasunstatedpremises.They\nmust be used and not said, at some point, or no inference is\npossible.\nEvery argument \u2018assumes\u2019 the associated conditional, \u2018if CON\nthenC\u2019.Thereisnopointinaddingthisconditionalasanexplicit\npremise in the interests of completeness, for the amended\nargument will again depend on just such a principle \u2014 namely\nitsownassociatedconditional.Thereisnopointinaddingitfor\ncritical understanding, for it is no easier and no harder to assess\nthan the original unreconstructed argument. Whatever else we\nsayaboutthedeterminationofwhichstatementsarethemissing\npremises, we can agree to ban the associated conditional as one\nof them.\nCarroll\u2019sTortoiseseemsespeciallymeticulousanddemanding\nbecause he will not reason according to modus ponens without\nhaving that rule stated as a premise in the argument. Logicians\nfeel outraged because modus ponens is, paradigmatically, a\nlogicallysoundprinciple,andbecausetheunamendedargument\nexemplifying the modus ponens pattern is paradigmatically not\nenthymematic. However, comparable moves seem more\nplausible when we move from deductive to nondeductive\ninference or from formal deductive inference to substantive\ndeductive inference. (Substantive deductive inference depends\non meaning rather than on form.)\nA hot topic for discussion among philosophers of logic used\nto be whether the inference from \u2018this is red\u2019 to \u2018this is colored\u2019\nrequired another premise, \u2018whatever is red is colored\u2019. Many\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 147 people believed that it did, for the inference was \u2018material\u2019 and\nnot \u2018formal\u2019. The example is like the relational argument Copi\ndiscussed, in that it is deductively valid in its original unamended\nform, in the perfectly straightforward sense that a state of affairs\nin which the premise is true and the conclusion false is an\nimpossible one. It seemed to some logicians to be incomplete,\nbecause it did not exemplify a formal pattern of valid inference.\nGaps will appear when one\u2019s theoretical expectations are not\nsatisfied. For a non-formalist deductivist, this argument is\ncomplete as it stands; for a formalist, it needs amendment.\nJudith Jarvis Thomson discussed the problem, and took the\nfollowing stand:\nthere is no such possibility as the possibility \u2018if this is red, it is colored\u2019\nwere not true, for \u2018if this is red, it is colored\u2019 is not merely true, but\nnecessarily true. And therefore, \u2018this is red\u2019 does by itself imply \u2018this\nis colored\u2019. And therefore there is in this no reason for saying that a\nman who so argues suppresses a further premise. Even if we grant that\nsuch a man is not reasoning unless he believes that if the thing is red,\nit is colored, there is in this no reason for saying that what he must\nbelieveifheistobereasoningmustbecalledasuppressedpremiseofhis\nreasoning.30\nThe point emphasized here is a generalization of the point\nCarroll made with reference to the associated conditional.\nAnyone arguing fromsome premises (CON) toaconclusion (C),\nmust is committed to the claim that if CON then C. This\ncommitment is indicated by his reasoning in the way he does\nreason, and it is \u2018assumed\u2019 by his argument. However, to say this\nis not to say that it is a missing premise in the argument.\nThomson reiterates the point in general terms, saying:\nto show that you must believe that p is a reason for q if you are to be\nreasoning in saying \u2018p, so q\u2018 is not yet to show that \u2018p is a reason for q\u2018\nmust be construed as a suppressed premise of the argument.31\nItisimportant,then,todistinguishwithinthoseassumptionsthat\n148TRUDYGOVIER arenecessaryinorderfortheinferencesofanargumenttowork.\nOnly some, bearing particularly and usefully on the argument at\nhand, are properly regarded as missing premises. The associated\nconditional should not be regarded as a missing premise. Nor\nshould the conclusion. Nor should a necessary truth which\nrelates the meanings of terms used in an argument already\ndeductively valid without the addition of such a truth. Nor\nshould methodological principles. In reasoning and arguing, we\nworkaccordingtosomeexplicitorimplicitrules,andthesework\nasrules,notaspremisesofourarguments.Themindneedssome\nsuch rules in order to reason and argue at all. Writing them in\nas missing premises will not avoid this need. It is a primary task\nof logic and the theory of argument to articulate and rationalize\ntheseprinciplesofinference.However,thatisnottosaythatthey\nare to appear as premises in every argument in which we reason\naccording to them. Carroll showed why this is so for simple\ndeductive logic. The point can be extended.\nIt is easy to ignore this point, as we can see in a recent paper\ndiscussing hidden premises. In \u201dHidden\u2019 or \u2018Missing\u2019 Premises\u2019,\nJames Gough and Christopher Tindale incorporate a\nmethodological principle as a missing premise in their analysis\nof an analogy. They discuss the following argument:\nA man who drives his car into the rear of another car is not guilty of\ncareless driving if his brakes failed. Similarly, if a man kills another\nmanheisnotfoundguiltyofmurderifhismindfailedtoperceivereality\ndue to mental illness. Mental instability is not sufficient to establish\ninsanity, as Mr. C. contends. Our judicial system justly requires that\na person must have rationally formed the intention to kill another\npersontobeconsideredamurderer.Insanityis,therefore,anappropriate\ndefense for murder.32\nAsGoughandTindalepointout,inthisargumenttheanalogy\nbetween failing brakes in a car accident and a failing mind in\na murder is used to support the conclusion that insanity is an\nappropriate defense for murder. But it is not the sole basis for\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 149 thatconclusion.Theanalogyisusedtosupportwhatourjudicial\nsystem requires \u2013 namely that one intend to kill in order to be\nconsidered a murderer. However, what is at issue in the present\ncontext is not the structure of the larger argument, but the way\nin which the analogy works. Gough and Tindale say:\nHere the conclusion: \u2018Insanity is, therefore, an appropriate defense for\nmurder\u2019 is supported by a number of premises including the following\nhidden assertion of a comparison:\nHP \u2013 The two situations are comparable, so if you accept the principle\nin the case of the driver/brakes, you should also acceptit in the case of\nthe murder/mental illness.\nThe authors are arguing, throughout their paper, that it is\nbetter to think of the problem of hidden premises than of the\nproblem of missing premises, because this rendering of the\nproblem makes us more likely to stick closely to the exact text\nordiscourseandlesslikelyto\u2018readin\u2019whateversuitsourlogical\nfancy as part of someone else\u2019s argument. They believe that the\nstatement which they would add to the analogy is in this sense\n\u2018hidden\u2019 in the original argument.\nThis assertion is not missing, but can actually be found in the\nargument. One of the considerations in assessing the strength of this\nargument will be the adequacy/legitimacy of this analogy.33\nAt this point we have a slide into incorporating methodology\naspremises.Anyargumentfromanalogydoesassumethatfrom\nsome similarities, others follow or are made likely. We have to\nassess this part of the argument. Of course this involves\ndetermining how closely similar the things are in the relevant\nrespects; that is what is involved in the evaluation of an\nanalogy.Butthatdoesnotmeanthatsomeassertiontotheeffect\nthatthethingsare\u2018comparable\u2019andinferencescanbemadefrom\ntheir comparability needs to be contained.

In the latter case, as we have seen, we should not regard the\ninferential assumption as a missing premise.\nWe do not put into every deductively valid argument the\nsupplementary premise \u2018when the truth of the premises makes\nthe falsehood of the conclusion a logical impossibility you can\ninfertheconclusionfromthepremises\u2019or\u2018nocontradictorystate\nof affairs is possible\u2019.

The gaps they fill are identified by\ninterpreting discourse in the light of a theory of argument. No\ntheory of argument should identify gaps on the grounds that\ninference rules are unstated, as Carroll\u2019s arguments show.\nItisseriouslymisleadingtouse\u2018missingpremise\u2019and\u2018unstated\nassumption\u2019asthoughtheyweresynonyms.Onlysomeunstated\nassumptions are in the proper sense missing premises.

Pragmatism,Scepticismand Missing Premises\nWhenweperceiveaninadequacyintheinferentialbasisforan\nargument, we may decide that that argument has one or more\nmissing premises. Then we have to select from among an\nindefinitely large number of candidate premises that could fill\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 151 this logical gap. There are various considerations that enter in\nhere. There is the desire to be charitable and fair to the arguer,\noften taken to entail attributing to him or her tacit premises\nwhichwillbetrueorplausibleandwillstrengthentheargument\nfrom an epistemic point of view. There is the desire for\ninterpretive accuracy, leading to a perceived need to justify\nsupplementationwithreferenceeithertootherstatedmaterialor\ntotheknownbackgroundbeliefsandassumptionsofthearguer.\nAnd there is the desire for efficiency and simplicity in argument\nanalysis. Obviously, these can pull us in different directions.\nAtthispointweencounterabroaderissue.Thatisthepurpose\nof argument interpretation and criticism. There are two\ndirections we may go, one emphasizing the issue which the\nargument is about, so that we try to fill out the best argument\npossible for the conclusion; and the other, a more closely\ninterpretive approach, emphasizing what the arguer said and\nwhether the stated reasons should be amended, in accordance\nwith his or her implied beliefs and intentions.\nThe idea that argument evaluation should be closely linked\nwith very charitable reconstruction is rather popular among\nphilosophers and logicians. However, it is open to more\nobjections than many people realize. Reconstructing an\nargument is not the same thing as appraising it, and argument\nanalysis should not be construed as a task which involves the\nambitious accumulation of all evidence bearing on the\nconclusion. The reconstructive view, in its most strongly\ncharitable sense, leaves it a mystery why we should pay any\nattention to the stated premises at all. If our purpose is to\ndetermine whether the conclusion is true or not, then we can\nthink about the conclusion directly, and the appraisal of\nanybody\u2019s argument for it is a subsidiary project. Pedagogically,\nthematterisofsomeimportance.Acourseonargumentanalysis\ndealsprimarilywiththestructureofargumentandtheappraisal\nof inference. Arguments on such issues as abortion or evolution\nare examples. If the primary purpose of examining such\n152TRUDYGOVIER examples were to determine the truth of the conclusion, then\nthe course on argument analysis would have to be a course on\nabortion andeverything else. Nooneisqualified toteachsucha\ncourse.\nHow charitable we should be is an issue that will arise when\nother principles have already been applied. First we use\ninterpretation and our theory of argument to show that a stated\nargumenthasinferencegaps.Thenwehaveanarrayofcandidate\ngap-fillers, all of which will do the logical work of filling the\ngap or gaps. From these, we can select those that cohere with\nthe beliefs, intentions, and commitments of the arguer, so far as\nwe are able to determine these. We have to decide how much it\nmatters whether we have evidence that arguers did accept these\ncandidatepremises,andwhetherourownstandardsoftruthand\nplausibility are going to be used in reaching our beliefs about\nwhat these arguers would have been likely to believe. We have\nto balance charity and interpretive accuracy, and how we do\nthis is likely to depend in part on our purpose in appraising the\nargument in the first place. Overly strong charity ignores the\npossibility that other people may actually think and reason in\nways which would strike us as implausible, odd, or downright\nwrong. Overly literal interpretation may produce accusations of\npedantic, non-substantive, and uninteresting analysis.\nWhen we look at other people\u2019s arguments, we should try to\nunderstand what they have said and determine whether they\nhave good reasons for their conclusions. Everyone would agree\non this, but people have different standards of what real\nunderstanding is, some linking it with charity in that\nunderstanding must mean making sense of from our own point\nof view. If we apply the principle of charity to see how well we,\nor someone, could defend that conclusion, we move argument\nanalysis in the direction of reconstructive discovery and\nsubstantive investigation. If we stick closely to the text and\nimmediately implied beliefs of the arguer, argument analysis\nlooks more like an interpretive project.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 153 Thus, it appears that what missing premises an argument has\nwill depend not only on how it is classified and how \u2018gappy\u2019 it\nis found to be from a theoretical point of view, but also on the\npurposes we have in analyzing it. If our purpose is to discover\nwhether the conclusion advanced is true, we will find one tacit\npremise,perhaps,whereasifourpurposeistoseehowthearguer\nin fact reasoned from the stated premises to the stated\nconclusion, we may find another. Thus, pragmatic\nconsiderationsenterintotheidentificationoftheverystructure\nof an argument. To the classically trained mind, this conclusion\nwill doubtless appear bizarre and unacceptable. We might think\nthat if missing premises have to be identified with reference to\nthe purposes of the critic, the game is given away altogether.\nThe missing premise is altogether a product of the critic\u2019s\nimagination, rather than being a feature of the argument itself.\nIn an earlier paper, I made the sceptical suggestion that\nmissing premises are nowhere except in the mind of the critic.\nIn that paper, I linked the discovery of missing premises to a\nconcept of \u2018complete argument\u2019 which could be universally\napplied. I said that we have no obviously applicable notion of\nexactlywhatwouldhavetobethereinorderfortheargumentto\nbe complete. I asked whether it is as though we judged a young\nfamily of man, wife, and two small children to be complete, but\nhad no basis for a view as to how large their complete family\nshould be. I then suggested that in this situation, when a person\njudges that an argument has a missing premise, he is virtually\nreduced to saying he would expect as part of the argument,\nsomething which is not there. He would expect one or more\nadditional premises. But why? The argument as it stands is not\ncomplete.Butwhy?Whatarecompleteargumentslike,andwhy\ndoesthisargumentfailtobeone?Intheabsenceofauniversally\napplicable notion of complete argument, it appears that the\nmissing premise is a product of the reflective mind. Like\nHumean causes, it is thrust upon the external text by the active\nintellect-of the critic.34\n154TRUDYGOVIER What now strikes me about these earlier reflections is the\npresumption that we need one single general account of what a\ncomplete argument is in order to say that a particular argument\nhas a missing premise. I now believe that this is not required.\nWhat we need is something less ambitious though perhaps still\nhard to obtain in some cases. We need a concept of complete\nargumentwhichwecanproperlyapplytothecaseathand.That\naccount need not be applicable to all arguments. Seeing an\nargument as having a missing premises means seeing its explicit\ninference structure as inadequate. There is a \u2018gap\u2019 to be filled,\nnot because there are some unstated assumptions that bear on\nthe argument, not because the argument fails to be deductively\nvalid, and not because some stated premises need defense. The\ngap exists because the premises, as stated, cannot give the\nappropriate support to the conclusion. We can either see the\nargument as inferentially flawed or see it as having missing\npremises. But many judgments have gone into the identification\nof this gap and many more are needed in order to determine\nwhich of the various candidate fillers is most appropriate.\nAre gaps there in the argument? Or are they projected by the\ncritic?Theyarereallythere,presumingthatcorrectnessofallthe\ncritic\u2019sinterpretiveandtheoreticaljudgments.Theyarenot\u2018just\nthere\u2019 in a theory-neutral sense.

Selection of one candidate from others, based both on\nepistemic (modest charity) considerations and on\ninterpretive considerations \u2013 respect for the actual\ndiscourse and beliefs which the arguer held or would have\nbeen likely to hold.\nConfident statements to the effect that such and such\nargument clearly has some statement as its missing premise are\ninappropriate.Whetherastatementisamissingpremiseinsome\nargument depends on our theory of argument, our purpose in\nanalyzing the argument, and much else.\nNotes\n1.

I continue to enjoy writing philosophical\ndialogues;mostoftheseareeitheraboutsocialissues(revenge,tolerance,\noffensive speech) or the views of historical philosophers (Kant,\nCondorcet, Diderot, Locke). Looking back, I find myself rather amazed\nthat I used this form for this material. Prima facie, the fit would seem\npoor. The participants explore two perspectives on argument analysis.\nCharmides takes the view that its point, even when one is focused\non a particular argument, is to discover whether the conclusion of\nthat argument is true. If one is inquiring into that subject, further\nclaims, evidence, and inferences are relevant to one\u2019s inquiry; one will\nthereforefeelfreetoaugmentaparticularargumentsoastoimproveit\nand provide stronger reasons for the conclusion. From that perspective,\nstrong charity may be defended; one seeks a strong case to explore\nthe best support for the conclusion whose truth one is investigating.\nCharmides is defending what some have more recently called\n\u2018steelmanning.\u2019 Reconstruction should be generous and can be\nambitious. The second perspective, that of Lysis, is narrower: one\nattends to a particular argument to consider its merits as an argument\nput forward by a particular arguer. One is exploring how well the\nproffered premises support the proffered conclusion in this argument\nby this arguer. The arguer\u2019s likely knowledge and beliefs should be\ntaken into account when one seeks to understand the argument;\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 161 understanding it is a necessary prelude to assessing it. Lysis urges\nagainst Charmides that a person evaluating an argument should not\nassume an obligation to fix up the argument first, especially given that\nshe is likely to fix it up according to her own standards and thereby\ndistort the original.\nIn this dialogue, I sought balance between the two perspectives. My\nown perspective is closer to that of Lysis, a fact which may emerge\nin the dialogue itself and which surely emerges in subsequent chapters\nhere and in the various editions of my textbook, A Practical Study of\nArgument.\nReading this dialogue again, my thoughts turn naturally to a\nquestion not explicitly raised here; that concerns dialogue models of\nargument. These models are popular and have been endorsed by Frans\nvan Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst, Erik Krabbe, Douglas Walton and\nmanyothers.Theyhavebeenchallengedbysome,includingJ.Anthony\nBlair and myself. Blair, in \u201cThe Limits of the Dialogue Model of\nArgument,\u201d(1997)pointsoutthatthereareplentyofargumentsthatare\nnotputforwardindialoguesettings.Aperson,solo,presentsacaseina\nbook,scholarlyarticle,orlettertotheeditor.Inexpressinghiscase,this\nperson should ideally consider how others may respond to it, and may\nseek to consider possible objections to it. But he and he alone, working\nsolo, has the power to construct and select possible objections; there is\nno one else with whom he is interacting and responding. Argument\nshould be dialectical in the sense that likely or potential doubts and\ndisagreementsaretakenintoaccountinconstructingtheargument.But\nthat is not to say that they are dialogical in the sense of being a turn-\ntaking exchanges. Blair urges that we draw a clear distinction between\n\u2018dialogical\u2019 and \u2018dialectical\u2019. I agree.\nBlair does not emphasize, as I would myself, that those who favour\ndialogue models typically construct the dialogue themselves. The\nsupposed opponent is not real; often the proponent is not either. The\ndialogue is a constructed model and one that does not reflect that real\ncontext of many real arguments. In \u201cWhen They Can\u2019t Talk Back\u201d\n(1999), I argued that the dialogue model is distorting for the many\n162TRUDYGOVIER casesinwhichargumentsareputforwardincontextswhereinteraction\nbetween the arguer and her critics is impossible.\nIn the present dialogue, one may say that the only real arguers are\nthe authors whose arguments are quoted and subject to analysis by\nthe characters Charmides and Lysis \u2013 that is to say F. Chatelet, Hugh\nLafollette, R.L. Gregory and J.G. Wallace, C.S. Peirce, C.W. Lewis,\nand Janet Keeping; their arguments provide data examined here. The\nconstructed characters Lysis and Charmides analyze and evaluate that\ndata (first level arguments). Their accounts, being about the first level\narguments, are on a second level. Lysis and Charmides discuss their\nstyleandprinciples ofargument analysisandevaluation. Thedialogue\nitself is about their accounts and is thus on a third level. Accordingly,\nyou might call this a meta-meta-discussion. No one is genuinely in\ndialogue, in the sense in which being in dialogue means being engaged\nand interacting with another person with opposed views. The exercise\nhas all been constructed, solo, by a single author: myself. This absent\npersonage has selected all the data and has constructed the norms and\nclaimsofbothoftheperspectivesthatareportrayedashavinginteracted\n(thoughtheyneverreallydid).Atthispointreader\u2019seyesmayglazeand\nheads may ache, as the mind starts to ponder post-modernism and its\nthemes.IassurereadersthatIknewnothingofpost-modernismwhenI\nwrote this (fictional) dialogue.\nAs mentioned, my own textbook is written from a perspective close\nto that of Lysis. In contrast, a recently successful book Reason in the\nBalance (first edition 2010) by Sharon Bailin and Mark Battersby\nproceeds from a perspective similar to that of Charmides. Bailin and\nBattersby urge that students learn to carefully examine an issue in\norder to come to a reasoned judgment about that issue. Students will be\nenabled to go beyond analysis of individual arguments, though fairly\nstandard material of argument analysis and evaluation is provided in\nthe work. One\u2019s goal when reflecting on the merits of arguments is\nto find out whether conclusions (about a given issue) are true or not.\nStudents\u2019 attention is directed not to the question of what this or that\nperson may have claimed and reasoned in her presented argument, but\nrather to the question of whether her proffered conclusion is true. The\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 163 authors urge that students should employ a constructive, open-minded,\nyetdisciplinedinquirytowardthatend.Dialoguespresentedinthework\nare realistic, though not real. As in the solo case, persons constructing\nthe dialogues retain the freedom to consider those objections and\ncounter-proposals that they select.\nI hope the unorthodox form of this chapter does not make it difficult\nto read, and I urge readers to consider some emerging questions. Is it\ndesirable that participant and spectator roles of argument assessment\npresume the same norms? Is it more charitable to attribute problematic\npremises than questionable inferences to an arguer? And inside every\npoorreasoner, istherea goodreasonerstruggling to get out?\nLYSIS: What\u2019s this all about, Charmides?\nCHARMIDES: What\u2019s what all about, Lysis?\nLYSIS: This business of trying to analyze and evaluate other\npeople\u2019s arguments? What do we do this for, anyway?\nCHARMIDES: The answer should be painfully obvious. We\nstudy arguments with a view to finding out whether their\nconclusions are true. In many contexts it is really important to\nknow what is true or probable. A very basic way of showing\nthat a claim is true or probably true is to justify it using a good\nargument. We study arguments because we seek the truth.\nLYSIS: Doyoureallythink so? Myidea is thatweevaluate other\npeople\u2019sargumentstoseewhethertheyhavegivengoodreasons,\nenough to convince us of their views. We aren\u2019t just looking to\nsee whether their conclusion is true or not. We want to see how\nwell the conclusion has been supported. After all, we sometimes\nfind poor arguments for conclusions we know to be true and\neven, occasionally, good arguments for conclusions we know\nto be false. Anyway, if our primary concern were to discover\nwhether a conclusion were true, I think that analyzing other\npeople\u2019s arguments would be a pretty indirect way of doing this.\n164TRUDYGOVIER CHARMIDES: No it wouldn\u2019t. What\u2019s your model of directness\nanyway?There\u2019snowayofdirectlyinvestigatingahardquestion\nallbyyourself.Youhavetoapproachthetruthbylookingatwhat\nother people have to say. You look at their arguments and by\nappraising these, you can get the best estimation of whether the\nconclusions they state are true or not.\nCHARMIDES: Well really, Lysis, this is all beneath discussion.\nOf course that\u2019s what I try to do, and that what any rational\nperson would do. You have to use charity when you interpret\nan argument, especially when people don\u2019t say all they have to\nsay. You will often find arguments that are not very good or that\nseem incomplete or unclear in some way. And then you can fix\nthese up, by adding a premise or several premises that are true,\nand plausible, and will improve the argument. Then you should\nadd these, interpreting the arguments so as to make them as\nsensibleasyoucan.Allthisisobviousandnecessarybecauseyou\nare seeking truth. By reconstructing an argument you can best\ndetermine whether its conclusion is true.\nLYSIS:Idon\u2019tunderstandwhyyoufindthisallsoobvious.Tome\nitisjustfalse.Yousee,Istudyargumentstoseewhetherthereare\ngoodgroundsgivenfortheconclusion.Idon\u2019tkeepmyattention\nfixed on the general question of whether the conclusion is true\nor could be shown true by some argument other than the one I\nam studying.

Practice what\n166TRUDYGOVIER youpreach,I\u2019dsay.Seriously,though,Idoagreethatoccasionally\narguments have missing premises. We need to supplement\nsometimes, but this is only legitimate when we have some basis\nfor believing that the missing premises are, or would have been,\naccepted by the author of the argument. After all, you know, the\ndiscovery of missing premises is not like the discovery of early\nhuman fossils. Missing premises are not buried logical objects.\nSometimes I think they are more like frustrated expectations.\nTheyarefoundnotinanylogicalearth,butintheactivemindof\na critic.\nCHARMIDES: So, the ontology of discourse \u2013 quite the\nmetaphysical theme! And these are quite the metaphors! But\nreally, you know, we already to have to read in a very\nconsiderable amount of background information just to\nunderstand words and grammatical relations, and the point of\nthe argument, and the significance of facts.

Of course we often need to fill in people\u2019s\narguments, in order to make them sensible and plausible. This\nis charitable, reasonable interpretation, and it\u2019s done in the\ninterests of the fair and efficient pursuit of truth.\nLYSIS: Well, I do agree that we sometimes have to resort to\nsupplementing an argument with additional premises. What\nreally bothers me about your view is not the idea that premises\ncould be missing but the fact that it is charity which will provide\nsome guidance on when to add premises and which ones to add.\nYour approach seems to ignore the very obvious fact that there\nare often differences between an arguer\u2019s ideas and beliefs and\nthose of the critic. When you say the critic should be charitable,\nthis all sounds very nice, but the critic may well read in things\nthat he thinks are improvements and by doing so, change the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 167 original argument so that it is more his own than that of the\nauthor. Surely we should only add premises the arguer would\nhave agreed with, or at least only those that he is logically\ncommitted to. A fringe benefit of my approach is that it saves an\nawful lot of work.\nFundamentally, though, the reason for it is that it keeps us from\ntaking flights of fancy on the wings of other people\u2019s thoughts.\nCall your own arguments your own. Don\u2019t go reading them into\nthe work of everybody else. This is misplaced charity and won\u2019t\nhelp you understand anyone.\nCHARMIDES: My good friend, this approach seems most\npedantic. What matters, fundamentally, is our quest for truth.\nWhat is pertinent to the truth is not whether this or that arguer\nin fact held this or that belief or used these exact words or some\nslightly different ones. It is not the arguer and his or her beliefs\nat all. It is the argument. Even though every argument is put\nforward by some person or other, it does not follow that every\nargument is inseparable from its author, bound to him or her\nforever by logical ties of ownership. The argument, once given,\nis a set of statements in the public domain, and for the purposes\nof systematic rational thought, it is this argument which is\ninteresting.

It\u2019s\ncompletely tendentious for you to insist that what you do gives\ngenuine understanding and what I do does not.

To say that an argument has missing premises is to say that\nit has inference gaps. The conclusion does not emerge from\nthe stated premises as it should in the type of argument\ngiven.\n2. When we find such an inference gap in an argument, we\nshould try to fill it. The original arguer could not have\nintended the argument to work as stated, because human\nreason does not aspire to create gappy arguments.\n3. Gaps should not be filled by statements of general\nmethodologicalprinciples,becausethatjustmeansagaphas\nbeenmisidentified. Norshouldtheybefilledbyastatement\nof the conditional associated with the argument, or a\ngeneralization of that conditional. Those would be\nreiterative and useless additions.\n4. Themainpointinaddingpremisesistoimprovetheoriginal\nargument. Missing premises should be selected so as to fill\nidentified inference gaps and so as to be either true or\nplausible.\n5. Since not all good arguments are deductive arguments,\nproper addition of premises will not necessarily make a\nreconstructed argument deductively valid. It will, however,\nmakeitaninferentiallycorrectargumentofsometype.With\nproper reconstruction, there are no fallacies in the sense\nof arguments involving inference errors, though there are\nmany nondeductive arguments.\n2.Lysis\u2018 Policy on Missing Premises\n1.

There are critically useless ways of filling gaps and these\nshould not be employed even when we do decide that gaps\nhave to be filled somehow. It is redundant to fill gaps with\nstatements of general methodological principles.

Results of the Exercise\nCase One\n. . ifthe perception of wax appeared to me more precise and distinct, after\nthat not only sight and touch, but many other cases besides, rendered it\nmanifest to my apprehension, with how much greater distinctness must I\nknow myself, since all the reasons that contribute to the knowledge of the\nnature of wax, or of any body whatever, manifest still better the nature of\nmymind? (Descartes,fromMeditationll;asquotedinTheRationalists\n(New York: Anchor Books, 1974), pp. 126 \u2013 7. Translation by John\nVeitch.)\n(Here Descartes is trying to show that, contrary to popular\nopinion, the mind is better known than physical things. He has\njust claimed that any judgment that a physical thing such as a\npiece of wax, exists, commits the subject to a judgment that he\nhimself exists, and that this judgment about his mind is known\nwith greater truth and certitude than the judgment about the\nphysical object.)\nStated Premises and Conclusion\n1. Sight and touch and many other things make wax manifest\nto my apprehension when I perceive it.\n2. All the reasons that contribute to the knowledge of wax or\nany other body contribute even better to the knowledge of\nmy mind.\n3. Even if I appear to know a body such a wax precisely and\ndistinctly, I know my mind much more distinctly.\nLYSIS: I know that this man Rene Descartes acquired a great\nreputation, and that he worked out some marvellous theories.\nBut even though this feeling is working in me, I can\u2019t see this\nparticular argument as a very good one. First of all, premise (2)\nis quite implausible. Secondly, there is an inference gap because\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 173 this premise speaks of contributing to the knowledge of the\nmind, whereas the conclusion is about the distinctness with\nwhich the mind is known. Knowing more facts about the mind\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily mean knowing the mind with greater\ndistinctness, because distinctness is a matter of differentiation,\nand when the facts in question are to come from the mind\u2019s\nknowledge of other things, there is no obvious way they could\ncontribute to this differentiation. There isn\u2019t really any basis in\nDescartesforfillinginthisgap.Soweshouldjustrecognizethat\nthe gap exists and that he has given us a poor argument, with\nboth a very implausible premise and an inference gap.\nCHARMIDES: I differ. This fascinating argument must have\nbeen part of something very important. As it stands, it isn\u2019t very\nclear, but it can be filled out so that the conclusion will be\nstrongly supported inferentially by fairly plausible premises.\nThere is an inference gap in the argument. We need to relate\nthe greater number of contributions to knowledge that we have\nregarding the mind, according to premise (2) to the greater\ndistinctnessallegedforknowledgeofthemindintheconclusion.\nWhatweneedtodoisconstructamissingpremisewhichwillbe\nasplausibleaspossibleandwillconnect(1)and(2)with(3)inthe\nmost logically acceptable way.

It\nis most reasonable to say that it will generally go along with\nknowing it with greater distinctness.

It is:\nMP1: In having more contributions to knowledge about one\nthing than another, I generally know that thing with more\ndistinctness than I would know the other.\n174TRUDYGOVIER When this extra premise is read into the argument, we can see\nthat there is some inductive reason for Descartes\u2019 conclusion,\ngrantingofcoursehisoriginalpremises.Thereisstillaproblem:\nthe problem that the second premise needs defense, and a\nthorough reconstruction would add more reasons to support\nthat as well. But we are only working on inference gaps right\nnow, we are not supposed to do anything about the need for\nsubarguments to support premises.\nCase Two\nOur degree is not recognized, but we have more students than ever.

Idiots have been given credits by faculty members teaching\nin universities.\n2. There are even bigger idiots in the government.Therefore,\n3. University faculty are not to be criticized for giving credits\nto idiots.\nLYSIS: This person can\u2019t have been nearly so famous as Rene\nDescartes, even though he seems to have the same nationality.\nThis example is a straightforward instance of a fallacy of\nrelevance. It seems to be a case of \u2018two wrongs make a right\u2019\nreasoning. The author cites a deplorable fact in the second\npremise. He tries to infer from the claim that the so-called idiots\nin the government are even stupider than the so-called idiots\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 175 in universities that university faculty should not be criticized.\nThis is irrelevant reasoning, because standards for government\nofficials have nothing to do with standards for universities.\nUniversity faculty are supposed to pass and fail students\naccording to proper judgments of those students\u2019 competence in\ntheir areas of study. Government officials\u2019 stupidity, even if it\nexists, has nothing to do with this. The argument is a gross non\nsequitur.\nCHARMIDES: Now here is an argument which requires\nextensivesupplementation.Itisstatedonlybriefly.Somehowthe\nauthor believes that standards of competence indicated by the\nelectoratearerelevanttostandardsforcreditgivenoutbyfaculty\nmembers at universities. The problem is that we have to find a\nmanner of supplementing the argument in order to express this\nintended connection in a plausible way, and we have to do this,\nmakingnotonlytheinferencelinkbuttheconnectingstatements\nplausible. Without such supplementations, the argument would\nlooklikeanonsequitur.Butfromtheveryfactthatitwasgiven,we\nknow the author thought government competence was relevant\nto the allotment of student credits. We have to make the\nconnection. The whole argument may be set out like this:\n1. Idiots have been given credits by faculty members teaching\nin universities.\n2. There are even bigger idiots in government.\nMPl: The electorate, in tolerating these bigger idiots in\ngovernment, indicates that community standards are\ntolerant of idiots.\nMP2: University faculty, in giving credits to idiots,\nindicate that they are tolerant of idiots.\nMP3: It is not the obligation of university faculty to be\nmore rigorous in their standards than is the electorate.\nTherefore,\n176TRUDYGOVIER 3. Universityfacultyshouldnotbecriticizedforgivingcredits\nto idiots.\nThe argument has three missing premises and should be\nreconstructed accordingly. The third missing premise is\nsuggested by the rhetorical question in the original argument.\nThe first and second missing premises are read in to make the\nstated material cogent. The argument has no fallacy, but its\npremises are controversial, especially MP3. We can surely judge\nthat this premise is false. Faculty are awarding specialized\ndegrees for which special qualifications are necessary. In\naddition, the second missing premise is not plausible, because\neven if it is a fact that government people turn out to be idiots,\nthat does not show that people were willing to tolerate idiots\nwhen they first elected them. The argument is rather weak,\nbecause of these problems with its premises, but it is not a non\nsequituror fallacy of any kind when it is properly filled in.\nCase Three\nOur society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal\nto perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do\nso. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people\nfrom practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have\nsatisfied certain licensing requirements.\nSociety\u2019sdecisiontoregulatejusttheseactivitiesisnotadhoc.Thedecision\nto restrict admission to certain vocations and to forbid some people from\ndriving is based on an eminently plausible, though not often explicitly\nformulated,rationale.Werequiredriverstobelicensedbecausedrivingan\nautoisanactivitywhichispotentiallyharmfultoothers,safeperformance\nof the activity requires a certain competence, and we have a moderately\nreliable procedure for determining that competence. The potential harm\nis obvious: incompetent drivers can and do maim and kill people. The\nbest way wehave oflimiting this harm without sacrificing the benefits of\nautomobiletravelistorequirethatalldriversdemonstrateatleastminimal\ncompetence.Welikewiselicensedoctors,lawyers,andpsychologistsbecause\nthey perform activities which can harm others. Obviously they must be\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 177 proficient if they are to perform these activities properly, and we have\na moderately reliable procedure for determining proficiency. Imagine a\nworldinwhicheveryonecouldlegallydriveacar,inwhicheveryonecould\nlegally perform surgery, prescribe medications, dispense drugs, or offer\nlegal advice. Such a world would hardly be desirable.\nConsequently, any activity that is potentially harmful to others and\nrequires certain demonstrated competence for its safe performance, is\nsubjecttoregulation\u2013thatis,itistheoreticallydesirablethatweregulate\nit. If someone has the requisite competence, then the action is not only\nsubject to regulation but ought, all things considered, to be\nregulated.(From Hugh LaFollette, \u2018Licensing Parents\u2019, in Philosophy\nand Public Affairs,1980.)\nLaFollette uses this argument to introduce his major theme,\nnamely that people should be licensed in order to become\nbiological parents.\nStated Premises and Conclusion\n1. Driving is licensed because it is potentially harmful and\nrequires a testable competence.\n2. Doctors, lawyers, and psychologists are licensed because\nthey perform\n3. A world in which anyone at all could drive, operate,\nprescribe drugs, or offer legal advice, would be very\nundesirable.\nTherefore,\n4. Any potentially harmful activity requiring testable\ncompetenceshouldberegulated,inthesensethatregulating\nit is theoretically desirable.\nLYSIS: This argument is a kind of hasty generalization. The\npremisesprovideaninsufficientrangeofcasesonwhichtobase\nthe conclusion, which is a universal one. The author seeks to\n178TRUDYGOVIER groundauniversalconclusiononaconsiderationsoffourkinds\nofactivities.Hefailstoconsiderthatthesefourmaynotbefully\nrepresentative. In the context of his later use of the argument,\nthis failure is very significant. The author uses this argument\nlater to defend his idea that the biological parents of children\nshould be licensed. But considerations of privacy, the human\ninstinct to reproduce, and the harmfulness to individuals\u2019 lives\nofanyfailureinsociety\u2019sadministrationofjudgmentsaffectthis\ncase far differently than those cases cited by the author.\nThe argument as it stands fails, and not in such a way that\nit would require supplementary premises to back it up. The\ndirection of the argument is clear. There is no inference gap:\nwe can understand how we are supposed to connect the stated\npremises with the conclusion. Furthermore, there is nothing in\nthe existing premises or surrounding text that could be used to\nconstruct any satisfactory missing premise even if we set out to\nlook for one. The conclusion might be true, but the argument in\nsupport of it is hasty and weak.\nCHARMIDES: There is a gap in this argument between the\npremises, as explicitly stated, and the conclusion. In order to\nsupport the conclusion with these premises, we have to make\nanadditionalsuppositionabouttheactivitiescited.Itisarather\ndifficult matter to construct a plausible version of that\nsupposition, since it is hard to see just what we need to assume\nabout driving, doctoring, giving legal counsel, and giving\npsychological advice which makes these activities license a\nconclusionaboutallpotentiallyharmfulactivitieswhichrequire\ntestable competence. We might add something like \u2018Other\nactivities that are potentially harmful and require testable\ncompetence are relevantly similar to these\u2019. This is still a bit too\nopen-ended and will be hard to verify, but we need something\nlike this in order to fill the logical gap between the cases cited\nand the universal generalization. The argument becomes\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 179 deductivelyvalidwhenthispremiseisadded,anditsmeritswill\ndepend on our appraisal of the added premise.\nCase Four\n\u2026throughoutHebbarguesthatthepositioninthechildisbasicallysimilar\nto that of the adult whose vision is restored at operation. Is this a tenable\nassumption? The adult, after all, has developed a \u2018touch world\u2019 which has\nserved him well for many years, and which has become accepted as the\nprincipal vehicle of his occupational and social adaptation. The child,\non the other hand, is concerned to develop a \u2018visual world\u2019 ab initio,\nand although tactile and motor activities contribute in an important way\nto its evolution, it is difficult to think of the two cases as in any real\nsense similar(From R.L. Gregory and J.G. Wallace, \u2018Recovery from\nEarly Blindness: a Case Study\u2019, in Paul Tibbets (editor), Perception,\n(Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1969), p. 385.)\nGregory and Wallace are arguing that it is a mistake to\nassimilate the case of an adult with a tactile-motor world but\nno visual world until an operation restoring sight with that of\na child who is simultaneously constructing a visual world and a\ntactile-motor world on the basis of perceptual experience.\nStated Premises and Conclusion\n1.

Anadultwhorecoversvisionafteryearsofblindnesshashad\na touch world which has become accepted as the principal\nvehicle of his occupational and social adaptation.\n3.

An adult who recovers vision after years of blindness is\nsignificantly different from a child developing visual\nperception.\nLYSIS:Thisisagoodclearargument.Therearenoinferencegaps\nand it has no missing premises. The authors show that Hebb\u2019s\nposition was unreasonable.\nCHARMIDES: This is a good argument, and the conclusion is\nadequatelysupportedbythepremises.Sincetheargumentworks\nasitstands,thereisnoneedforanyreconstructionusingmissing\npremises.\nCase Five\nThe object of reasoning is to find out, from the consideration of what\nwe already know, something else which we do not know. Consequently,\nreasoning is good if it be such as to give a true conclusion, from true\npremises,andnototherwise.(FromC.S.Peirce,\u2018TheFixationofBelief,\u2019\ninPragmatism:theClassicWritings,editedbyH.S.Thayer.NewYork:\nMentor Books, 1970, p. 63.)\nStated Premises and Conclusion\n1. Theobjectofreasoningistofindoutfromtheconsideration\nof what we already know something else which we do not\nknow.\nSo,\n2. Reasoning which gives us a true conclusion from true\npremises is good reasoning.\nand,\n3. Reasoning that does not give us a true conclusion from true\npremises is not good reasoning.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 181 LYSIS: This is an ambitious argument. The philosopher seeks\ntwo conclusions from a single premise. The problem is not with\ninference.Itisthatthepremiserequiresclarification.Iftheword\n\u2018know\u2019 is understood too narrowly, the premise will be false, for\nthe purpose of reasoning is also to form reasonable beliefs on\nthe basis of other things which we have good reason to believe.\nHowever, since this philosopher was a fallibilist, he would likely\nhave been willing to equate having good reason to believe with\nknowing.Ifthisisdone,thepremiseisallright.Thedirectionof\nthe argument is clear enough.\nBut just as we had to clarify \u2018know\u2019 in the premises, we have\nto look at the semantics of the conclusions. First we have to\nunderstand them as being about reasoning of a type; because if\nwe don\u2019t do this, (2) is vulnerable to counterexample. You can\neasily reason from a true premise to a true conclusion without\nemploying good reasoning, just by being lucky. So we must\nunderstand that the references to reasoning are to general\npatterns of reasoning. Right after making this argument, Peirce\ngoes on to speak of \u2018habits of the mind\u2019, so this interpretation\nhas a good textual basis. However, there is still a problem with\n(3). Whereas (2), as explained here, can be inferred from (1) \u2013\nreasoning has such-and-such purpose; reasoning of so-and-so\ntype serves this purpose; therefore reasoning of so-and-so type\nis good reasoning, (3) cannot. The only way to make (1) true is,\nas we have seen, to understand \u2018know\u2019 in a flexible sense that\nwouldbesuggested byPeirce\u2019sfallibilism. Onthisinterpretation\nof (1), (3) does not follow from (1), because reasoning might give\nus probable conclusions from probable premises, satisfying (1),\nbut not (3).\nSincethisargumentneedssomuchclarification,wecanrightly\naccusetheauthorofvagueness,andsinceitcanonlyworkwhen\n\u2018know\u2019 is understood in two incompatible ways, we can also\naccuse him of equivocation. However, these problems do not\n182TRUDYGOVIER generate inference gaps and the clarification needed is not to be\nsupplied by extra premises.\nCHARMIDES: This certainly is a challenging case. It doesn\u2019t\nwork very well as it stands, so something must be added to it to\nmake it more clear. The argument is really about the purpose of\nreasoning, which Peirce specifies in (1). Of course here, we will\ngettoolimitedapurposeifweunderstand\u2018know\u2019inarestrictive\nway as requiring both solid justification and truth. So we shall\nhave to understand \u2018know\u2019 more loosely, as including believing\nfor good reasons. The point of the argument is that reasoning is\ngoodreasoningifandonlyifitservesitspurpose,asstatedin(1).\nThe reference to reasoning in (2) and (3) must be understood as\nreferring to reasoning of a type, for otherwise (2), at least, is too\neasily vulnerable to counterexample. The most elegant thing to\ndo here is to turn Peirce\u2019s passage into two separate arguments.\nThe first:\n1. Theobjectofreasoningistofindoutfromtheconsideration\nof what we already know something else which we do not\nknow.\nMPl: Reasoning that gives us a true conclusion from true\npremises lets us find out something we do not know from\nsomething we do know.\nMP2: Reasoning that serves its purpose is good reasoning.\nSo,\n2. Reasoningthatgivesusatrueconclusionfromtruepremises\nis good reasoning.\nThe second argument is:\n1. Theobjectofreasoningistofindoutfromtheconsideration\nof what we already know, something else which we do not\nknow.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 183 MP3: Reasoning that does not give us a true conclusion from\ntruepremisesdoesnotletusfindoutsomethingwedonotknow\nfrom something that we know.\nMP4: Reasoning that does not serve its purpose is not good\nreasoning.\nSo,\n2. Reasoning thatdoesnotgiveusatrueconclusionfromtrue\npremises is not good reasoning.\nThere is still a problem of language, even after this inferential\nclarification. It affects the second argument. To get a charitable\ninterpretation of (1), we understood \u2018know\u2019 as a fallibilist would.\nYetsuch an understanding wouldmakeMP3 false. Nevertheless,\nMP3 is needed to reach the conclusion. If we revert to a more\nclassical understanding of the word \u2018know\u2019, consistency of\nmeaning is restored, but on this interpretation (1) is either false\nor highly controversial. Peirce gave one good argument and one\nunsound one. Both, when properly understood and filled in, are\ndeductively valid.\nCase Six\nYou can get a large audience together for a strip tease \u2013 that is, to watch\na girl undress on the stage. Now suppose you came to a country where\nyou could fill a theatre simply by bringing a covered plate onto the stage,\nand then slowly lifting the cover so as to let everyone see, just before the\nlights went out, that it contained a mutton chop, or a bit of bacon, would\nyou not think that, in that country, something had gone wrong with the\nappetite for food?(From C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, quoted by R.\nOlson in Meaning and Argument (New York: Harcourt Brace and\nWorld, 1960.)\nLewis is trying to defend traditional Christian sexual morality.\nHe uses the analogy to argue against sexual display for titillation\nand amusement.\n184TRUDYGOVIER Stated Premises and Conclusion\n1. Ifpeopleenjoyedwatchingtheuncoveringofamuttonchop\nor a bit of bacon, which they were not going to eat,\nsomething would have gone wrong with their desire for\nfood.\n2. Peopleenjoywatchingagirlundressonstagewhentheyare\nnot going to have sexual relations with her.\nSo,\n3. Something has gone wrong with our desire for sexual\nexpression.\nLYSIS: This amusing argument is quite complete as it stands.\nThe direction of the inference is clear. The argument obviously\nis based upon the analogy between the hunger for food and the\ndesire for sexual expression, both being human appetites. From\nthe first premise, stating hypothetical circumstances, and a\nposited judgment that in these circumstances, something would\nhave gone wrong, and the second premise, revealing the\nsimilarity between the strip-tease and this hypothetical case, we\nare to infer that something has gone wrong with sexual appetite\nin the world of strip-tease. Whether the analogy is good or not\nseems to be a moot point, but in any event there is no need to\ninsert a supplementary premise; the intended direction of the\ninference is entirely clear. A full appraisal of the argument\ndepends on an exploration of the relevant similarities and\ndifferences between hunger and the desire for sex.\nCHARMIDES: The argument as it stands is quite clear, but the\ninference structure could be improved if premises were added\nformulating and clarifying the basic analogy between the desire\nfor sex and the desire for food. We need to add a premise to the\neffect that the desire for food and the desire for sex are human\ndesires that are fundamentally similar with regard to deliberate\narousal and subsequent satisfaction. We don\u2019t say they are\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 185 fundamentally similar in all respects, because this assertion\nwould be stronger than the argument requires, and implausible.\nWe specify those respects required for the argument to work.\nProvided this added premise is true, the argument is a good one.\nCase Seven\nInordertoprosecuteforusingthemailtosendobscenematerial,\nthe police should require the consent of the Attorney General.\nSo urged Janet Keeping, President of the Calgary Civil Liberties\nAssociation,inalettertotheAlbertaAttorneyGeneral.Herletter\nwas provoked by a recent prosecution in that province against\nJoseph MacDonald for an \u2018obscene letter\u2019 he reportedlywrote to\ntheUnemploymentInsuranceCommission.Frustratedbydelays\nin the processing of his unemployment claims, Mr. MacDonald\nhad written a letter to the UIC in which he allegedly compared\npublic servants to certain parts of the human anatomy and\nadmonished them to commit unnatural acts.

Thanks to David Gallop for bringing this\nexample to my attention. It is Mr. Chumir\u2019s argument, as\nreportedthatwillbedealtwithhere.Wearetoldthatheusedthis\nargument to back up the Civil Liberties group in its contention\nthat the use of coarse language should not be an offense that is\nprosecuted.)\nStated Premises and Conclusion\n186TRUDYGOVIER 1.

Peopleshouldnotbeprosecutedforusingobscenelanguage\nin letters.\nLYSIS: Here is a case which really does have a missing premise,\nat least as reported. The need for this premise is apparent when\nwe see that (1) is supposed to provide the basis for (2), and yet\nas these are stated there is no clear connection between the\nstatements. We know that Mr. Chumir, the author, is a lawyer\nspeaking for a civil liberties group, and so it is reasonable to\nattribute to him a linking belief: namely that it is not desirable\nforhalfthepopulation towindupincriminal court.Thiscanbe\nadded as a missing premise in the argument.\nCHARMIDES:Severalpointsarisehere.Obviouslytheinference\nfrom(1)to(2)isnotclearasitstands.Weneedtoaddsomething\nwhichwillbringouttheintendedconnection.Also,ifwetake(1)\nliterally,wemightthinkthatitrequiressomedefense.Theauthor\nhasaratherdramaticestimateofthenumbersofpeoplewhouse\ncoarse language. But missing premises are to fill inference gaps,\nnot to buttress stated premises. The argument should be filled\nout so that it reads as:\n1.

Peopleshouldnotbeprosecutedforusingobscenelanguage\nin letters.\nWe can see that there are two strands in this argument: the\nnumbers who might be in court, and the relation between bad\ntaste and prosecution.\n4. Analysis of the Results\nCHARMIDES:Thatwasquiteexhausting.Iamcertainlygladit\u2019s\nover.\nLYSIS: So am I. Now the interesting part begins. We can discuss\nour results.\nCHARMIDES: Well, our results do seem to indicate that\nargumentscancomeoutlookingstructurallydifferentwhenone\nis more or less charitable on missing premises. Usually my\nanalyses were quite a lot longer than yours, and I was far more\nwilling to add extra premises. Yet, I wouldn\u2019t say, when I look\nat your exercises, that they really seem wrong. It is sometimes\nalmost as though one and the same passage really can be\nunderstood in several quite different ways.\nLYSIS: I wouldn\u2019t say your analysis looked wrong to me either.\nReally, it even makes me wonder a little about right and wrong\nin finding the structure of an argument. Maybe some natural\narguments have more than one structure.\nYou know, it used to be that people thought there was such a\nthing as the structure of a sentence. There was one single logical\nform that the sentence had. Then some came to a more\n188TRUDYGOVIER sophisticated and flexible view and decided that what form a\nsentence had could vary depending on why we were looking for\nits form. A sentence like \u2018Joe is happy\u2019 could be represented a\nuniversal statement that all things identical with Joe are happy,\nor as a single existential statement that this one individual Joe\nis happy, or even just by an atomic statement represented by a\nsingle letter. It\u2019s not wrong to show it as one or the other. It\u2019s\nmore or less useful, depending on where the sentence appears\nand what we are trying to do when we are interested in its form.\nDifferent versions of argument structure might work like this.\nMaybeyourlongerversionsandmyshorterversionscanequally\ncountasrepresentationofthestructureofnaturalreasoning,and\nmine is better for some purposes, whereas yours are better for\nothers.\nCHARMIDES: I don\u2019t know about that. That sort of structural\nrelativism seems at least as confusing as the problem of missing\npremises itself.\nLYSIS:Pragmaticconsiderationshavetoplayarolehere,Ithink.\nCouldn\u2019titbethatyourapproachbestrepresentsthestructureof\nan argument for some purposes and mine for others?\nCHARMIDES: Perhaps. But it would be nice to have a more\nelegant and definite solution than that. Actually, we did agree in\nsome cases, after all. We thought the argument by Gregory and\nWallace, the two psychologists refuting that other psychologist,\nwas successful without any supplementation. And that last\nargument, you know, the amusing one about obscenity in the\nmails, we saw it in almost the same way.\nLYSIS: Those were good arguments. The inferences were pretty\nsolid and clear. In that last case, it was obvious from the context\nwhat had to go in, and what we inserted was obviously true\nand obviously accepted by the author. Those aren\u2019t the kinds of\ncases where our views differ. Good arguments don\u2019t need a lot\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 189 of supplementation. Usually, a person who puts forward a good\nargumentknowsenoughthatthereisnotabigcontrastbetween\nadding plausible claims and adding claims that he or she clearly\naccepts. It is perfectly understandable that we don\u2019t differ much\nontheanalysisofgoodarguments.Wedifferonpoorarguments.\nIhavetheimpressionthatthemorehastilyanargumentisstated,\nthemorecarelesslyitisput,thecrazieritspremises,thesloppier\nits inferences, the more we shall differ. You see a need for more\nandmoreadditions,andIjustrejectthingsasincorrect\u2013having\nproblematic premises or hasty or irrelevant inferences.\nCHARMIDES: It\u2019s funny though. Even there, the differences\nbetween us can be exaggerated. For instance, although we had\nvery different looking analyses for that argument by Descartes\nand the other one about the French professors giving credits\nto idiots, we didn\u2019t really disagree on the substance of the case.\nWe just located problems in different places. On Descartes, for\ninstance, you just said he made a hasty inference, explained why\nyou thought it was hasty, and that was that. Whereas I went to\na great deal of trouble to set out the argument clearly, adding a\nclaim which I thought was logically presumed in order for the\ninferencetowork.Itwasahardcase,andI\u2019mstillnotsureIhave\nit right. But then, when I had finished setting out the argument,\nI could see that the premise I had added was false or at least\nvery implausible. So I didn\u2019t say the argument contained a hasty\ninference but I had to say it was a weak argument, because it\nhad an unacceptable premise. You say Descartes made a hasty\ninference.Iseehimasreasoningaccuratelyfrompremiseswhich\nare not acceptable. Our structural models were different, but\nas far as the substance of the issue is concerned, we are really\nin complete agreement. We both think that Descartes has not\nestablished in this reasoning that the mind is better known than\nany physical body. We both think this because what the mind\nknows about itself when knowing a body is not the sort of thing\n190TRUDYGOVIER that would make the mind distinctly known, as Descartes\u2019\nconclusion requires.\nLYSIS: I noticed that. Although we state our results in different\nways, there is not a single case where we really disagree on a\nmatter of final assessment. It almost seems to me as though you\nthink of the same criticism which would occur to me and then\nyou form the negation of it and write in that negation as a\nmissing premise. You then find, after reconstruction, that the\nargument is quite all right, except for that one premise, which\nis false, or at least highly controversial. With that example about\nregulating activities, that happened. I said the four cases cited\nby the author might not be representative. You said that the\nauthor presumed that the cases were representative, and then\nquestioned the presumption, regarding the inferentially\nreconstructed argument as having a controversial or false\npremise.\nYour critical route seems roundabout to me. It is supposedly\nmotivated by charity, by the desire to make out as good a case\nas possible even for those arguers who express themselves in\na hasty way. Given that you almost always have to go on and\njudge the premises you have added as unacceptable, I must say I\nam not even sure why this amounts to charity. You are making\nthe same critical points, essentially, and just locating them in\ndifferent places.\nI see your use of missing premises not so much as charity but\nrather as a powerful critical weapon. In fact, sometimes your\ntechnique reveals critical problems I never would have noticed\nwithout it.\nCHARMIDES: Let me tell you a little story. There was a society\nin which many people are fat, and these people, especially if\ntheywereveryfat,werequiteoftencriticized,insulted,andeven\nostracized by others. The fat women were very different from\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 191 thefatmen. Thereweremoreofthem, theyworried moreabout\nbeing fat, and they responded tocriticism and personal attack in\na very timid way, quite differently from the way men did. They\nusually made excuses for themselves, and pretended to be on a\ndiet even if they really weren\u2019t. The fat men, on the other hand,\nwere pretty aggressive about handling criticisms of themselves\nfor being fat. They fought back, verbally at least, when attacked.\nLYSIS:Really,Charmides,thisisratherdepressing.Besides,what\non earth could it possibly have to do with charity and missing\npremises? We weren\u2019t working on dietary supplementation, you\nknow! Some of this background information we got must really\nbe churning up your mind and brain!\nCHARMIDES: Wait a minute. I\u2019m getting to the point. One man\nwho was told he should go on a diet said to his acquaintance, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t have any problem. At least it\u2019s easier for me to change my\nbody than for you to change your stupid brain and smarten up.\u2019\nSome people who heard about this response thought that it was\nwarranted by the insult. But others were shocked. Think about\nwhy one might be shocked. We can learn something here, which\nbearsonthismatterofcharityandmissingpremises.Imean,why\nwould one find the idea of attacking another\u2019s brain or mind so\nmuch worse than the idea of attacking another\u2019s body?\nLYSIS: Gosh, I\u2019m overwhelmed. What kind of analogy are you\nusing here anyway? There have to be some missing inferential\nlinks in this one. I am glad you\u2019re here to fill them in, because I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\nCHARMIDES:Weallhaveourlimitations.Look,thethingis,itis\nmoreoffensivetoinsult aperson\u2019smindorbrain, orintelligence\nthan to insult his or her body. This is because we tend,\nfundamentally, to identify the real person much more with the\nmind than with the body. We are like Rene Descartes in this\nrespect. We think a person is essentially a thinking reasoning\n192TRUDYGOVIER thing, and we think of the thinking and reasoning capacities as\nrelatively fixed.\nLYSIS: Goodness. I think I can see now what you\u2019re getting at.\nYou suggest that in just the way a person\u2019s mind is more\nessentiallythatpersonthanhisorherbody,aperson\u2019sreasoning\nismoreessentiallyhimorherthanthatperson\u2019sassumptionsand\nbeliefs.Soitismorecharitable,andlessthreatening,toclaimthat\na person has made questionable assumptions than to claim that\nhe or she has reasoned badly. Assumptions and beliefs can come\nand go, but our reasoning powers are a fundamental part of us,\none that we have forever.\nCHARMIDES: That\u2019s it exactly. So even though we agree on the\nsubstance of the various issues with the arguments I am still\nbeing more charitable and more respectful of persons than you.\nIt is because of the way I locate my criticisms. Beliefs and\nassumptions are more easily shed than styles of reasoning.\nLYSIS: Well, there is so much I want to question about these\nassumptions \u2013 yours, I mean. I think, you see, that people may\ninadvertently reason badly. Bad reasoning on an occasion need\nnotexpressapermanentpoorqualityreasoninaperson.Andalso,\nI think beliefs and assumptions can be a fundamental aspect of\na person\u2019s cognitive style. So the contrast between reasoning as\nexpressing a relatively permanent aspect of a person\u2019s capacity\nfor thinking, and assumptions and beliefs as more easily\ndroppable is not really valid. As a general contrast, it won\u2019t hold\nup.\nI\u2019mfascinated, though,byyouranalogy.Wemightthinkofthe\ncommonsayingthatinsideeveryfatpersonthereisathinperson\nstruggling to get out. You could imagine that inside every poor\nreasoner, there is a competent reasoner, struggling to get out.\nI don\u2019t think people who make hasty or irrelevant inferences,\nerrors formal or informal, have something in them called \u2018poor\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 193 reasoning ability\u2019. Rather, they share with everyone some\ncapacity to reason well. It is just that, for whatever reason, that\ncapacity has not been productively applied to the argument we\nare criticizing. Perhaps the person was careless, or distracted,\nor overly emotional about the issue, or so committed to the\nconclusion that it didn\u2019t seem necessary to find very good\nevidence for it. Good reasoning can emerge. One thing that will\nmakeitemergeissharp,pungentcriticismthatpointsouterrors\nin reasoning and explains why these are errors.\nAnyone, however great, original, or profound, can make\nmistakesinreasoning, asineverything else. Tosaythatthisman\nDescartes,whoweweretoldwasaverygreatphilosopher,made\na mistake in reasoning is not to insult him or to imply that he\nlacked reason, or even that he was not a great philosopher. It\nis simply to show that one particular inference wasn\u2019t correct,\nperiod.Anyway,whatmakespeoplegreatorprofoundisnotjust\nthecorrectnessoftheirinferences.Itistheiroriginality,capacity\nto identify and resolve new problems, ability to synthesize, and\nmuch else. So much else.\nCHARMIDES: I see what you\u2019re saying. And yet it is more\ncharitable to reject arguments on the grounds of containing\nunacceptable premises than to reject them on the grounds that\ntheyhavehastyorirrelevantreasoning.Peopleregardreasoning\ncapacityasamoreessentialandlessvariableaspectofthemselves\nthantheirvariousassumptionsandbeliefs.Theywouldfarmore\nreadilyacceptacriticismalongmylinesthanyours.Criticismof\nsuppressed premises will be perceived as more charitable \u2013 and\nfor that reason it will be more charitable.\nLYSIS: You mean, in this context to be perceived is to be?\nCHARMIDES: Of course not. But if you can make the same\npoint in two different ways, and one of them is likely to be\nmore psychologically effective than the other, because people\u2019s\n194TRUDYGOVIER underlying assumptions make them more receptive to it, then\nyou should use that approach.\nLYSIS: Well, I don\u2019t know. You seem to be shifting grounds.\nWe are now moving from logical and interpretive issues to\npsychological and pedagogical ones. After all, it could be that\nwhatismosteffectiveincausingpeopletoproduceclearer,better\narguments, using better reasoning, is my approach. It will more\nquicklyshockpeopleoutoftheirsloppyhabitsandmorerapidly\nleadtocarefullystructuredreasoning.Myapproachwouldmore\nquickly improve reasoning and would for that reason be more\n\u2018kind\u2019 than yours.\nCHARMIDES: I won\u2019t pursue the subject further then, because\nwe are getting off the topic. Surely which premises are missing\ndoesn\u2019t depend on which teaching technique is most effective!\nLYSIS:Theoneanalysisofyoursthatreallybotheredmewasthat\ncase where the French professor was trying to defend himself\nagainstthecriticismthathehadgivencreditstostupidstudents.\nRemember? It seemed to me that what he said about the\ngovernment having even worse idiots was clearly irrelevant to\nthe issue.

But you know there is another kind of case in which\nyour approach seems inappropriate. We sometimes have to deal\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 195 withfragmentarytextsbygreatthinkers,orwithtextswrittenin\na deliberately elusive way, by writers who want their readers to\nthink for themselves and, to achieve this, quite pointedly do not\nspelleverythingoutinapedanticandliteralfashion.Here,ifyou\nfail to read in, you won\u2019t find claims and arguments at all. And\nyet some of the greatest thinkers have given us, or left us, only\nfragmentary or elusive texts.\nLYSIS: With fragments, I rather think it\u2019s better to leave them\nas fragments, with their poetic flavor intact, and read in a lot\nof claims and arguments. And as for elusive writers, that\u2019s a\ndifferent case. They do give you the basis in another part of\nthe text for the various attributions you need. You\u2019ll be able to\nadd the requisite premises to arguments using my approach,\nassuming that you want to get an explicit argument in that sort\nof case. Often, the statement of problems and the suggestion of\nhypothesesorimagesismoretheissuethantheactualargument.\nCHARMIDES: But on the French professor example \u2013 not\nDescartes, the other fellow, perhaps that case does reveal\nsomething of general importance about my approach. I agree\nthat the amount of work I put into the thing was out of all\nproportion to the seriousness and worth of the original piece.\nPerhaps this is because the argument was not the argument of a\ngreat man. I didn\u2019t owe him the kind of respect I would owe to\nDescartesorPeirce,orevenC.S.Lewis,forthatmatter.Perhaps\nI should qualify my policy of charity, and only apply it when the\nargument was put forward by a person who has a claim to be\ntaken seriously.\nLYSIS: I just can\u2019t go for that. It\u2019s so undemocratic! You\u2019re\nimplying that some people have a greater claim to be taken\nseriously than others. And when people have a greater claim\nto be taken seriously, then we should adopt your sort of policy\ntowardthem,anddoalotoffillingout,ifnecessary,tomaketheir\nargumentsplausible.Whereas,whenpeoplehavelessclaimtobe\n196TRUDYGOVIER taken seriously, they merit less charitable treatment? I don\u2019t like\nthis approach. My view is that everyone who enters the realm\nofrationalargumentationdeservesequaltreatment.Ifyourview\nis going to be amended so as to apply only to the elite, then it\nappeals to me even less than it did before.\nCHARMIDES: Just as some people have greater credibility as\nwitnesses, or experts on scientific facts than others, so too some\npeople have greater credibility as arguers. It is one thing to\nattribute a hasty inference to your local bank teller and quite\nanother to attribute it to Descartes or Peirce.\nLYSIS: I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like it at all. It\u2019s dialectical elitism,\nthat\u2019s what it is.\nCHARMIDES: Well, a label isn\u2019t an argument. It\u2019s just true that\ndifferent thinkers have different levels of credibility and merit\ndifferent amounts of respect. Calling it \u2018dialectical elitism\u2019 won\u2019t\nmake it false.\nLYSIS: Now we\u2019re back to the other problem. Is criticizing\nsomeone\u2019s argument on the grounds that it contains hasty or\nirrelevant reasoning disrespectful? I can\u2019t see that it is, frankly.\nAfter all, your criticisms and mine do not differ in substance,\nonly in location. You attack beliefs, and I attack inferences. I\nnever really conceded that that difference makes the difference\nyou ascribe to it.\nCHARMIDES: Well it does.\nLYSIS:Letmeaskyousomethingelse.Thereisadistinctionthat\nbecomes blurred when people try to argue about the theory of\nargument. It is the distinction between sitting down to do an\n\u2018analysis\u2019 of an argument, which pops up out of nowhere and is\nan example some theoretician is using to illustrate a point, and\nactively rebutting or accepting someone\u2019s real argument in the\ncontext of a live conversation or debate. We might call the first\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 197 spectator analysis and the second participant analysis. People\nwho try to theorize about arguments are likely to do unusual\namounts of spectator analysis. And people who try to teach\nothers how to argue well are likely to do unusual amounts of\nit as well. Since it is often the very same people who teach and\ntheorize, there is a tendency for the spectator point of view to\npredominate when these people think about arguments. Yet\nsurely it is participant analysis which is the more fundamental\nof the two, isn\u2019t it? I maintain that it is. Arguing is defending\nclaims with reasons, and people do this in order to rationally\npersuadeothersofwhattheyhavetosay.Typically,peopleargue\nand respond to arguments in contexts of actual ongoing debate,\nwhere there is controversy and disagreement. If it were not for\nparticipants, there would be nothing for the theory of argument\nto be a theory of. Participant analysis is primary, and spectator\nanalysisisderivative.Spectatoranalysisshouldbeinaccordwith\nwhat participants do when they respond to each other\u2019s\narguments.\nYou and I have been participants in a debate about spectator\nargument analysis. As theorists, we are stuck doing lots and lots\nof spectator analysis. It\u2019s an occupational hazard, we might say.\nJust as judges should refrain from seeing all humans as potential\ncourtcasesanddoctorsshouldrefrainfromlookingateveryone\nas prospective patients, we should avoid looking at every\nargument from the view point of spectators. An argument is\nnot primarily a thing written on a page; it is primarily a set of\nclaimsadvancedbyapersonwhoistryingtorationallypersuade\nsomeone else. And responding to an argument is above all,\nrejecting or accepting claims and inferences, on the basis of\nreasons that can be put forward to the arguer. Any theory or\npolicy which we come up with, for handling arguments, should\napply to participant analysis as well as to spectator analysis.\nCHARMIDES: Get to the point, will you?\n198TRUDYGOVIER LYSIS: The thing is, I can apply my policy on missing premises\nequallyasaparticipantandasaspectator.WhenIargue,actively,\nwith you, I point out that some inference involves hastiness, or\nirrelevance, unless the immediate context and my knowledge or\nyour related beliefs permits me to fill in the gaps in your case. If\nthings don\u2019t seem right, I just say so, and I let you respond. I can\napply my policy in real ongoing debates, as well as in spectator\nanalysis of sample arguments. Can you do this too? Do you?\nI don\u2019t feel, really, when we are arguing together that I, as a\nparticipant, get the treatment you recommend for filling in gaps\nwhenyouarticulateyourpolicyforspectatoranalysis.Youimply\nthat when you are doing spectator analysis, but you don\u2019t seem\nto apply it when you are participating in a real debate like the\none we are having now. Is your policy like those philosophical\ntheories that won\u2019t bear up in practice?\nCHARMIDES: Well then, yours just might be one of those\ndebater\u2019spracticesthatdoesn\u2019tbearupintheory!I\u2019llthinkabout\nit. The question is whether I apply my charitable policy in real\ndebate. This can be turned into two questions. First whether\nthe policy could be applied in this way; second, whether I do in\nfact apply it this way.

It is that you are\nalsoaparticipant,andyouareentirelycapableofdoingyourown\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 199 filling in. If you use an argument which strikes me as containing\na non sequitur, I can just ask you whether you accept this or that\nconnecting premise, or ask you how the two things are\nconnected, and you can reply. People participating in ongoing\narguments on several sides of an issue are in a very different\nposition from people responding to an argument in a written\ntext, where there is no opportunity for direct response from the\nauthor.ThefactthatIdon\u2019tusemypolicyinparticipantcontexts\ndoesn\u2019t show I have a philosophical theory that cannot be put\nto practice.

But the last part is more\ncomplicated than you realize. You see, the contrast between\nanalyzing as a spectator and responding as a participant is not\nas straightforward as you suggest. Of course, when we work\nout examples in teaching or in trying to figure out a theory of\nargument, we work as spectators, in your sense. And of course,\nwhen we debate with each other, we work as participants. But\nthese contexts are at the ends of a spectrum, really. It\u2019s not an\neither/or. We are often doing something in between. We study\narguments written down somewhere, and we study them in the\ncourse of developing a theory of our own on some subject. This\nis participant analysis in that we are not studying an example\nfor some pedagogical or theoretical purpose, but rather we are\nstudyingitbecausewehaveadirectconcernfortheissueitdeals\n200TRUDYGOVIER with. Here is where my original idea comes in. I\u2019d say that this\ntoo is participant analysis. However, like spectator analysis in\nmostcases,ittypicallygivesusnoopportunitytohavearesponse\nfrom the person whose arguments we are studying.

It leaves the door open to reading in too much, and it\ndeviates from the text too much.\nCHARMIDES: Your approach still strikes me as hasty and\nuncharitable. You never once found a case where I read\nsomething in which was not needed for the logic of the\nargument. And you agreed that my approach was a powerful\ncritical tool. In one case it revealed a problem you had not even\ncontemplated.\nLYSIS: What is \u2018the logic of the argument\u2019? That is a major thing\nin question here.

Many authors urge, just as Scriven did\ndecades ago, that one should make an argument mean \u2018something that\na sensible person would have been likely to mean\u2019; in other words, one\nshould render a person\u2019s proffered argument as rational as possible.\nThat means selecting and interpreting the premises so that they are\ntrue or as plausible as possible, and interpreting the inferences so as\nto give support to the conclusion. The same presumptions are made by\npersons who advocate steelmanning. In philosophical circles, advice to\nbe charitable is often tempered in textbooks and academic papers by\nreminders that while employing a principle of charity one must at the\nsametimebeaccurateandfaithfultowhatanarguerhasactuallysaid.\nClearly these two admonitions may conflict. I sense little attention of\nlatetothatproblemandscantadviceastowhattodowhenthereissuch\na conflict.\nTheproblemthattheothernessofotherarguersmaydisappearunder\nthe mantle of charity, noted here, has subsequently been discussed and\nnamed \u2018the problem of cultural imperialism.\u2019 It is agreed that if\notherness is made to disappear, that is a problem. Evaluating an\nargument, one should not interpret others, and especially not others\nfromforeignculturesordifferentsubcultures,asclaimingjustwhatone\nwould claim oneself. Making them out to be what we would regard as\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 203 rationalorsensible,orwhatwewouldunderstandtobetruestatements\nabout the world, risks doing just that. The risk has been acknowledged\nanddefendersofcharityinsomeformorothermaintainthatitneednot\ngo that far.\nThePrincipleofCharitystatesanormforinterpretation.Thatnorm\nhas often been couched in ethical terms (\u2018be fair\u2019) or prudential terms\n(\u2018you might have to do all your work over again if the argument you\ncriticizecanbeeasilyamendedsoastobebetter\u2019).JonathanAdler(1995)\nurgedthatthenormofcharityshouldberegardedasanepistemicnorm,\nbasedinthedesiretoevaluateanargumentinordertodiscoverwhether\nthe conclusion of that was true. That view, he said, was epistemic:\npresumably one\u2019s goal was that of knowledge \u2014 to find out the truth\nof the conclusion. In other words, Adler took a position close to that of\nCharmides in the previous chapter. In friendly discussions with Adler,\nI took a position closer to that of Lysis, urging that the Charmides\nposition risked seeing a person\u2019s argument as merely a kind of\nlaunching pad on a road to discovering whether various premises were\ntrueandinferencescorrect.Inhis1995article\u201cCharity,Interpretation,\nFallacy,\u201d Adler approved of the Gricean base used here; charity is\nunderstood not as based on norms of ethics or prudence but rather as\ngrounded on the purpose of argumentative discourse. That is to state\na claim and provide reasons for it; presumably the arguer states a\nclaim that she regards as true or plausible and states support that she\nregards as strong or conclusive. Adler took the position that a principle\nof charity, even a fairly strong one, would not be strong enough to\neliminate fallacies. That work appeared after this chapter; nevertheless\nI now feel that I should have given more attention to the prospect of\nepistemic norms to rationalize a principle of charity. For me, though,\nthat would still be moderate charity as distinct from strong charity.\nTypically, human behavior is interpreted on the assumption\nof rationality. To understand why someone acted as he did we\ntry to comprehend what his reasons might be. To understand\nwhy someone said what he did, we try to comprehend what\ninformation hewouldbetrying tocommunicate. Tounderstand\n204TRUDYGOVIER how someone is reasoning, we try to see a line of thought that\nwould be coherent and logical. Charity directs us to adopt that\ninterpretation of human behavior according to which it makes\nthe most \u2018sense\u2019. Principles of charity have been proposed for\ntheinterpretationofactionanddiscourseandtheinterpretation\nof arguments in particular. Charity as a principle of argument\ninterpretationmayowepartofitsacceptancetotheprominence\nof interpretative charity in other explanatory contexts.\n1. Background\nThe principle of charity was introduced by Neil Wilson in an\narticleaboutreferencethatappearedintheReviewofMetaphysics\nin1959.Wilsonrecommendedthefollowingrulefortranslators:\nWe select as designatum that individual which will make the largest\npossible number of statements true.1\nThat is, we assume that others aim to tell the truth. If, by\ninterpreting others who use \u2018x\u2019 to refer to rabbits rather than\nmammals we can make more sense out of what they say in the\nsense that more of their statements turn out to be true, it is that\ninterpretation which is correct.\nQuine, following Wilson, endorsed charity for what he called\nradical translation. Suppose we are dealing with an unfamiliar\ntribe and do not understand its customs and practices when we\nbegin the task of translation. There are always alternative ways\nof interpreting discourse and actions. Quine recommended that\n\u2018assertions startlingly false on the face of them are likely to turn\non hidden differences of language\u2019, adding that:\n\u2026 one\u2019s interlocutor\u2019s silliness, beyond a certain point, is less likely than\nbad translation or, in the domestic case, linguistic divergence\u2026 the more\nabsurdorexoticthebeliefsimputedtoapeople,themoresuspiciousweare\nentitled to be of the translation; the myth of the prelogical people marks\nonlytheextreme.Fortranslationtheory, banalmessagesarethebreathof\nlife.2\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 205 Among various tenable translation hypotheses, we opt for those\nthat will make the logical and empirical beliefs of the tribe the\nmost sensible and coherent.\nQuine assimilates radical translation to understanding in our\nown culture. He sees it as an extreme case of what must go on\nallthetimeinordinarylifeandordinarylanguage.Ingeneral,we\ninterpretpeople\u2019scommentssoastomakethemouttobesaying\nsomething that makes sense to us. This procedure could be seen\nas the application of a kind of translation principle to our own\nlanguage. Within our own tribe, we translate the remarks of a\nfellow native who uses our own language.\nMust we equate our neighbor\u2019s English words with the same strings\nof phonemes in our own mouths? Certainly not, for sometimes we do\nnot thus equate them. Sometimes we find it to be in the interests of\ncommunication to recognize that our neighbor\u2019s use of some word, such\nas \u2018cool\u2019 or \u2018square\u2019 or \u2018hopefully\u2019, differs from ours, and so we translate\nthat word of his into a different string of phonemes in our idiolect \u2026\nwe are always prepared to temper homophony with what Neil Wilson\nhas called \u2018the principle of charity.\u2019 We will construe a neighbor\u2019s word\nheterophonically now and again if thereby we see our way to making\nhismessagelessabsurd\u2026Theproblemathomediffersnonefromradical\ntranslationordinarilysocalledexceptinthewilfulnessofthissuspension\nof homophonic translation.3\nQuine\u2019s ideas were further developed by Donald Davidson,\nwho employed a principle of charity to dispute the claim that\ndifferentconceptualschemescanbeusedtodifferentlycatalogue\nthe same reality.\nI suggest, following Quine, that we may without circularity or\nunwarranted assumptions accept certain very general attitudes towards\nsentencesasthebasicevidenceforatheoryofradicalinterpretation.For\nthesakeofthepresentdiscussionatleastwemaydependontheattitude\nof accepting as true, directed at sentences, as the crucial notion. Since\ncharityisnotanoption,butaconditionofhavingaworkabletheory,itis\nmeaninglesstosuggestthatwemightfallintomassiveerrorbyendorsing\nit. Until we have successfully established a systematic correlation of\n206TRUDYGOVIER sentences held true with sentences held true, there are no mistakes to\nmake. Charity is forced upon us: whether we like it or not, if we want\nto understand others, we must count them right in most matters. If we\ncanproduceatheorythatreconcilescharityandtheformalconditionsfor\na theory, we have doneall that could be done to ensure communication.\nNothing more is possible and nothing more is needed.We make\nmaximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret\nin a way that optimizes agreement (this includes room, as we said, for\nexplicable error, i.e. differences of opinion).4\nThis is a very strong principle of charity. Davidson requires\nthat,inordertounderstandothers,wemust\u2018countthemrightin\nmostmatters\u2019,sayingwemake\u2018maximumsenseofthewordsand\nthoughts of others when we interpret in a way which optimizes\nagreement\u2019.Thus,theprincipleDavidsondefendswillonlyrarely\npermit us to attribute to others faulty beliefs or reasoning, and\nthen only when all other feasible interpretations have failed.\nNotably, Davidson is claiming that charity in this very strong\nsense is not even optional. We do not choose whether or not to\nbe this charitable, because such a policy is a condition of having\nany workable theory.\nBoth Quine and Davidson move quickly from a radical exotic\ncontext where little background knowledge may be assumed to\nthe domestic context. In the domestic context, the other minds\nsceptic would tell us we can assume little. But there are few\nsuch people: other minds scepticism has not been in fashion for\nmanydecades.ItisnotlikelythatQuineandDavidsonwishedto\npose a full-blown problem of other minds and use a principle of\ncharitytosolveit.Whatisatworkmaybealingeringpositivism:\npositing meanings, intentions, and purposes requires special\njustification.\nCommentatorsonQuineandDavidsonhavenotbeeninclined\ntodisputetheargumentativejumpfromforeigntribestofriends\nand colleagues in our own native culture. And yet the domestic\ntribe and the foreign tribe are too readily assimilated. There\nare surely vast differences here. If we cannot assume that we\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 207 understandthesignificanceofsuchgesturesassmilesandwaves\nin our own culture, that most of the time people use the word\n\u2018dog\u2019 to refer to canines, that others are friends with whom we\nhave had previous contact, and so on, then in understanding\ndiscourse,weareasanthropologistsapproachingaforeigntribe.\nBut since we do and must assume these things in order to live\nand function in our own culture, our position is quite different.\nAs Wittgenstein emphasized in On Certainty, were our position\nnot different, we could not survive and live together.\nAnaccountcanbuildupaspectrumofcasesofvaryingdegrees\nofdifficultyinunderstanding,suchthattheforeigntribeisatone\nend of the spectrum and close individuals in our own \u2018tribe\u2019 are\nat the other. Thus, we might move, in theory, from my difficulty\nin understanding the foreign words of a Zulu chieftain, to my\ntroubleunderstandingthewordsofanEnglishmicrobiologist,to\nmy problems understanding the words of a Canadian child, and\nin understanding the words of my own close Canadian friends.\nThere are differences of degree from the hardest to the easiest\ncases.\nQuine\u2019s assimilation of foreign and domestic translation\nproblemsmayhavebeentemptingtohisphilosophicalaudience;\nwe can easily construct this spectrum of cases, and the cases\nso arranged differ from each other by degrees. However, it is a\nwell-known fallacy to infer from such facts that all cases on a\nspectrumarethesame.5Differencesofdegreecanaccumulateto\nmakesignificantdifferences\u2014aswhenapersongaininganounce\na day eventually gains one hundred pounds. The difference\nbetween interpretive problems with foreign tribes and\ninterpretive problems that arise within our own culture are real\nand significant in practice. The latter should not be assimilated\nto the former.\nAs well as radical and radical-domestic translation, the\npresumptionofrationalityhasbeenappliedinrecentphilosophy\nofmind.DanielDennetthasaconceptofintentionalsystemsthat\nrequires extremely strong charity. Dennett defines intentional\n208TRUDYGOVIER systems as systems in which predictions of behavior using\nintentional language (the language of desires and beliefs) are\neffective.(Thereisnonecessarylink,onhisview,betweenbeing\nan intentional system and being conscious; nor does being an\nintentionalsystemrequireanyspecificphysicalstructureortype\nof physical structure.) Dennett uses the concept of intentional\nsystems to work out a non-dualistic position on the mind-body\nproblem. He makes a strong presumption of rationality a\ncondition of adopting the intentional stance. For intentional\nsystems, we are committed to strongly charitable interpretation.\nAccordingtoDennett, ifwefail tointerpretsuchsystems inthis\nway,wemustaltogetherrenouncetheintentionalinterpretation\nand adopt a physicalistic approach. Dennett says:\nThere is a third stance one can adopt toward a system, and that is the\nintentionalstance.Thistendstobethemostappropriatewhenthesystem\none is dealing with is too complex to be dealt with effectively from the\nother stances. In the case of a chess playing computer one adopts this\nstance when one tries to predict its response to one\u2019s move by figuring\noutwhatagoodorreasonableresponsewouldbe,giventheinformation\nthe computer has about the situation. Here one assumes not just the\nabsenceofmalfunction,buttherationalityofthedesignorprogramming\nas well.6\nOn Dennett\u2019s account, to describe and predict the behavior\nof any entity that is an intentional system requires a theory of\nrationality, because we describe and predict on the assumption\nthat it is making reasonable responses, given its desires and\nbeliefs. In another paper, Dennett makes the link between\nintentional systems and the imputation of rationality even more\nexplicit:\n1. A system\u2019s beliefs are those it ought to have, given its\nperceptualcapacities,itsepistemicneeds,anditsbiography.\nThus in general, its beliefs are both true and relevant to its\nlife \u2026\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 209 2. A system\u2019s desires are those it ought to have, given its\nbiological needs and the most practicable means of\nsatisfying them. Thus (naturally evolved) intentional\nsystems desire survival and procreation, and hence desire\nfood, security, health, sex, wealth, power, influence, and\nso forth, and also whatever local arrangements tend (in\ntheir eyes \u2013 given their beliefs) to further these ends in\nappropriate measure \u2026\n3. A system\u2019s behavior will consist of those acts that it would\nbe rational for an agent with those beliefs and desires to\nperform.7\nOn this theory, it is only when we regard an entity as\nconstituting an intentional system that we can properly ascribe\nto it beliefs, interests, intentions, and the desire to communicate\nideasandarguments.Theconsequenceisthatanyinterpretation\nof human action or discourse will be based on a strong\npresumption of rationality.\nItisnotclearwhetherDennettgoessofarastosaythatthereis\nneverafalsebelief,anirrationalaction,oramistakeinreasoning.\nIn the first passage quoted, the phrase \u2018one assumes not just\nthe absence of malfunction but the rationality of the design or\nprogramming as well\u2019 suggests that his view will have this\nconsequence. Dennett appears to be saying that, from the\nintentional standpoint, malfunctions are absent and design or\nprogramminghastoberegardedasrational.Theseclaimswould\nentail that what we typically describe as faulty reasoning would\nbe properly describable only in physicalistic terms, as the result\nof a physical breakdown of some type.\nHowever, this interpretation of Dennett may not be correct,\nand the second passage quoted here, wherein the phrase \u2018in\ngeneral\u2019 is used, seems to allow for errors within the intentional\nsystem, provided these are occasional.8 This ambiguity in\nDennett\u2019s work has been noted by Stephen Stich, who criticizes\nDennett for making too strong a presumption of rationality.\n210TRUDYGOVIER Stich says that \u2018if we accept Dennett\u2019s trade, we will have no\ncoherent way to describe our cognitive shortcomings nor the\nprocess by which we may learn to overcome them.\u20199 Stich thus\nemphasizes the deeply conservative and anti-reformist\nimplications of accounts of this type. Only if we believe that\npeople sometimes commit errors in reasoning and arrive at\nincorrect beliefs will it make sense to try to improve reasoning\nand correct some of these beliefs.\nWe may make a presumption of rationality in the sense that\nweassumethatgenerallyotherpeoplearerational,orwemaygo\nfurtherandassumethattheyarealwaysrational.Thediscussions\ncited tend in the direction of saying that people are rational\nwheneverweunderstandthem.Ifweinterpretthemasirrational\nthen, on this account, we have made a mistake: we do not\ncorrectly understand them.\nIf charity is a presumption of understanding, whether for\ntranslationorexplanation,howstrongapresumptionisit?Does\nit outweigh other indications to the point of ruling out all poor\nlogic,incoherentbeliefs,absurdlyfalsebeliefs,irrationalactions,\nand errors in reasoning? Or does it merely put the onus in favor\nof alternative ascriptions, allowing that sometimes other\nindications can rightly lead us to alternatives that are less than\nrational?\nIn\u2018RationalityandCharity\u2019,PaulThagardandRichardNisbett\ndistinguish and criticize principles of charity that have been\nexpressed as methodological canons of translation or social-\nscientific understanding. They note that such principles have\nseldombeenspelledoutprecisely,anddistinguishdifferentlevels\nof strength:\n1. Do not assume a priori that people are irrational.\n2. Do not give any special prior favor to the interpretation that\npeople are irrational.\n3. Do not judge people to be irrational unless you have an\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 211 empirically justified account of what they are doing when they\nviolate normative standards.\n4. Interpret people as irrational only given overwhelming evidence.\n5. Never interpret people as irrational.10\nThagard and Nisbett argue that principles of charity as\nstringent as (4) and (5) are methodologically unsound, whether\nthe context is that of translation (radical and domestic), or\nunderstanding inference, or understanding choice. Principles at\nlevel(3)areprinciplesofmoderatecharity;thoseatlevels(4)and\n(5) are principles of strong charity.\nFor translation, Thagard and Nisbett claim that, given\nbackgroundknowledge,wemayhaveexcellentempiricalreasons\ntoascribeafalsebelief,orevenacontradictorysetofbeliefstoa\nsubject.Infact,insomecases,wemayhaveabroaderknowledge\nof cultural context which makes the imputation of a false belief\nor an \u2018illogical\u2019 set of statements extremely plausible. As an\nexample, Thagard and Nisbett cite a passage in which Hegel is\nmaking a point about change which depends on his description\nof change as violating the principle of non-contradiction. A\npassage from his Logic is translated by A.V. Miller as \u2018something\nmoves, not because at one moment it is here and at another\nmomentthere,butbecauseatoneandthesamemomentitishere\nand not here, because in this \u2018here\u2019 it at once is and is not.\u2019Hegel\napparentlybelievedthatmotionwascontradictory.Accordingto\nThagard and Nisbett, he used the German equivalents of \u2018and\u2019,\nand \u2018not\u2019 in ways so familiar that \u2018no other translation would\nbe appropriate\u2019. Supporting Miller\u2019s translation, Thagard and\nNisbett comment that to \u2018charitably\u2019 interpret Hegel so that he\ndid not violate the principle of non-contradiction would be to\nfail to take him seriously. It is not that Hegel did not write\nelsewhere as though the principle of non-contradiction was\nalwaysgenerallytrueandapplicable.Rather,inthispassageheis\ntrying to say that change is paradoxical.\n212TRUDYGOVIER On this account language can be used for social or other ends\napart from communicating information; maintenance of\nprinciples of logic may be irrelevant to such ends. There can be\nsound empirical reasons for translating and interpreting so as\nto leave unorthodox beliefs unaffected. Thagard and Nisbett do\nnotethispoint.ItseemsthatQuine,atleast,isnotcommittedto\ndisagreeing with it, provided that there is sufficient agreement\nonbasicempiricalbeliefsandlogicalprinciplestogiveafoothold\nfor understanding. Thagard and Nisbett conclude their\ndiscussion of translational charity by saying that very strong\nprinciples are empirically unsound.11\nStrong methodological charity is, in fact, methodologically\ndangerous, precisely in contexts where we are trying to\nunderstand other languages, other minds, and other cultures.\nThere is in some circles a presumption that to understand we\nmust agree. This presumption surely deserves scrutiny. Even if\nwe concede that in order to understand, we must agree a fair\npercentage of the time, that is not to say that understanding\npresumes full agreement all the time. There is an underlying\ndifficulty with a model that insists on very wide agreement in\norder to \u2018make sense\u2019 of others\u2019 discourse. A fundamental\nproblem is that the otherness of other minds and cultures may\nbe lost if charity goes too far. It may be true that without some\npresumptionsofsharedbeliefsandasharedlogic,understanding\nof language is impossible. But a presumption is a presumption.\nIt can be outweighed in particular contexts by other\nconsiderations. With too much charity we will seek\nunderstanding of others to find only ourselves. What begins as\na gesture toward tolerance will defeat itself by blocking\nunderstanding that emerge from an encounter of differences.\nThagardandNisbettarepreparedtorecommendcharityonlyat\nlevels (l), (2), and (3). I would share their caution.\nThagard and Nisbett call Davidson\u2019s and Dennett\u2019s principles\n\u2018astoundingly strong\u2019 and insist that they are empirically\ninadequate. It is possible, on their view, to have good empirical\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 213 reasons to believe that other people hold beliefs that we do not\nhold, or make erroneous inferences about causes and other\nmatters.Ifwemakecharitysostrongastoruleouttheascription\nof false belief, faulty logic, or irrational action, we will bar any\nefforttocorrectbeliefsandpractices\u2013whetherourownorthose\nof others.\nThere is no reason, however, why it should not be possible to determine\nempirically that a system is regularly using some inferential principle\nheuristic that departs from standard logical principles, then to use the\noperation of this heuristic as part of an explanation of the system\u2019s\nbehavior.12\nCultural anthropology does indeed require that we approach radically\ndifferent belief systems with as great as possible a suspension of our\nownpresuppositions,butnothinginthehermeneuticprocessrequiresus\nactually to accept the presuppositions of the exotic culture under study.\nWecanunderstandapeople\u2019sbeliefthatswamplightisspirit,orthatsex\nand procreation are unrelated, without supposing that these particular\nbelief systems have any truth at all.13\nThe trouble with strong charity is that it would have us\ndiscount the empirical evidence that can strongly favor\ninterpretations of discourse and behavior that would not be\n\u2018rational\u2019 or \u2018sensible\u2019 in our terms. We may have good empirical\nevidence that a ceremony is done for the purpose of bringing\nrain, and good empirical evidence that the ceremony is seldom,\nin fact, followed by rain. We do not ourselves believe that\nceremonies are customarily followed by rain but this by itself is\nnot a sufficient reason not to ascribe such a belief to a tribe that\npractices rain dancing, when linguistic and contextual evidence\npoint in that direction. To ascribe such a belief, we must be\nable to make it fit with linguistic and cultural patterns in the\nculture in which it is held. That is, in a weak sense, seeing the\nbelief as sensible and rational, seeing it as held for a purpose\nand as serving that purpose, and thus as rational to that extent.\nAscribing such a belief does not require seeing it as true or as\n214TRUDYGOVIER warrantedbyevidenceandreasoning.Nordoesitrequireseeing\nitasabeliefwewouldholdoronewewouldregardasadequately\nsupported by evidence.\nRichard Nisbett, Lee Ross, and others have conducted\npsychologicalexperimentsoninference.14Theyclaimthatsome\nerrors are especially common in human subjects, and postulate\nthattheseerrorstendtooccurwhen\u2018heuristics\u2019whichareuseful\nin some contexts are wrongly applied in others. Some\npsychologists and philosophers have criticized their work on\nvarious grounds, with some alleging uncharitable interpretation\nofparticularmovesbysubjectsandothersallegingthatimputing\nmechanisms that produce faulty reasoning is mistaken in\nprinciple.15 Whether Nisbett and Ross have interpreted their\nexperimental responses correctly and whether they have used\nthe appropriate standards of inductive inference is a topic\nbeyond my present discussion, obviously. What is at issue here\nis inference error in the light of interpretive charity. If we were\nto adopt Dennett\u2019s view, on its most radical interpretation, or if\nwe were to regard the discourse of our subjects as one we have,\nin effect, to translate, using the strongest principles put forward\nby Quine and Davidson, we could not find inference errors,\nand this for methodological rather than empirical reasons. But\nsuch a strongly charitable approach is mistaken. It too greatly\ndiscounts the empirical evidence that can support alternative\ninterpretations according to which behavior is not rational. It\nmakes a presumption too much more than a presumption. It\nreduces, ultimately, to an insistence that others conform to our\nown standards and a resistance to the discovery of alternative\nstandards or any recognition of a need to improve present\nperformance.\nIn short, strong charity \u2013 levels (4) and (5) in Thagard and\nNisbett\u2019s analysis \u2013 is too strong for a sound interpretive\nmethodology. If Quine, Wilson, Davidson, and Dennett really\nrequire principles of charity this strong for their philosophical\npurposes, their accounts stand in need of revision. Such\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 215 principles are not adequate as a foundation for the empirical\nstudy of foreign tribes, foreign languages, domestic tribes,\ndomestic language, or domestic inference. If moderate charity\nwouldservethosepurposes,somuchthebetter.Ifnot,alternative\napproaches must be sought.\n2. Charity and Argument Interpretation\nThe attitude of unquestioning respect for principles of strong\ncharity in argument interpretation may owe something to the\nphilosophicalbackgroundjustdescribed.However,onreflection\nthere seems to be only a tenuous connection between these\nbroad philosophical contexts and the particular context of\nargumentanalysis.Interpretationisinvolvedwhenweextractan\nargument from discourse in our own language. In this context\nwe presume a basic understanding of customs, meaning, and\nsyntax. We are not concerned to resolve scepticism about other\nminds, to understand the utterances or customs of a foreign\nculture, or to generate an epistemic basis for meaning or mind.\nWe are interpreting a speech or text in order to determine\nwhether it contains an argument and, if so, what that argument\nis. Any deep philosophical dependency on strong charity\nrequired for such broader tasks is the background, not the\nforeground.\nThere are at least six pertinent stages of interpretation,\nordered roughly as follows:\n1. We determine whether the speech or passage contains an\nargument or not.\n2. We determine, for argumentative passages, which sentences\nwithin them express premises or conclusions.\n3. We determine, for terms within those sentences that are\nambiguousorindeterminateinreference,whatthemeaning\nor referent is likely to be, and whether words are meant\nliterally or figuratively.\n216TRUDYGOVIER 4. We decide what inference standard should be used to\nappraise the argument.\n5. We determine whether the stated premises and conclusion\nconstitute the argument or whether there is implicit\nmaterial that needs to be added.\n6. If we judge that there is implicit material to be added, we\ndecide what that material is.\nIt is for these purposes that treatments of argument analysis\nhaveappealedtotheprincipleofcharity.16Aprincipleofcharity\nfunctions as an interpretive principle used in the identification\nof the parts of arguments and in the clarification (where\nnecessary)ofmeaning.Thislastusecomesclosesttothebroader\nphilosophical contexts wherein charity was proposed, but there\nis a crucial difference. It is the difference between foreign and\ndomestic \u2018translation\u2019. Here, the broad philosophical theory of\ncharity and interpretation would bear directly on charity for\nargument interpretation if we were to grant Quine\u2019s analogy\nbetween radical and domestic translation and Davidson\u2019s\nsubsequent usesofit.Ontheseviews,verystrongcharitywould\nbe required for all interpretation of discourse, as a condition\nof making sense of what others have to say. Obviously,\nargumentative discourse would be included. But, as argued\nabove, the radical-domestic analogy ignores significant\npragmatic differences.\nStrong charity is too strong to be methodologically sound.\nIn argument analysis, if one term or structure poses semantic\nproblems, these are resolved in a context where most other\nmeaningsandthegeneralpurposeofthediscoursemaybetaken\nas understood. Typically, we do not face a radical problem in\nunderstanding the \u2018idiolect\u2019 of the argument, only a particular\ndifficulty arising in this specific context.\nThat charity in argument interpretation is a lower level\nprinciple than those of Quine, Davidson, and Dennett is\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 217 implicitlyrecognizedintherationalesphilosophershaveoffered\nfor it. They do not claim that without charity we will be\naltogether unable to understand the language of other arguers\nor to ascribe to those speakers\u2019 intentional states. Rather, they\njustify the principle on ethical or prudential grounds. They say\nthat it would be \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018unkind\u2019 to arguers to give their\ndiscourse anything less than a maximally sympathetic\ninterpretation; in effect this seems to be a claim that persons\ninterpreting and evaluating arguments are morally obligated to\nbe charitable. Or they say that it is imprudent to criticize an\nargument on anything less than a maximally sympathetic\ninterpretation,becausewhenwedo,theargumentcantooeasily\nbe revised so as to make our analysis irrelevant. We can find\nthese themes in Michael Scriven\u2019s classic account.\nThe Principle of Charity requires that we try to make the best rather\nthan the worst, possible interpretation of the material we\u2019re\nstudying.Thatis.evenif,asamatterofstrictgrammar,wecouldshoot\nthe writer down for having said something that doesn\u2019t follow or isn\u2019t\nstrictlytrue,itmaybemorecharitabletoreinterpretthepassageslightly\ninordertomakemore\u2018sense\u2019outofit,thatis,tomakeitmeansomething\nthat a sensible person would be more likely to have really meant.We\u2019ll\ndo this all the time. It doesn\u2019t mean letting people off the hook entirely\nbyassumingtheycouldn\u2019tpossiblyhavemeantsomethingjustbecauseit\nturnsouttobeunsoundoruntrue;mostofusmakesuchmistakesquite\noften. What the Principle of Charity does mean is that taking \u2018cheap\nshots\u2019issomethingweshouldn\u2019twastemuchtimedoing\u2026ThePrinciple\nof Charity is more than a mere ethical principle, but it is at least that\n\u2026It requires you to be fair or just in your criticisms ... they shouldn\u2019t\ntake advantage of a mere slip of the tongue or make a big point out\nof some irrelevant point that wasn\u2019t put quite right \u2026 The Principle of\nCharity does coincide with good practical advice about powerful and\nefficient argument analysis. It tells you that you want to interpret the\nargument\u2019smeaninginwhateverwaymakesthemostsenseandforceout\nofit,becauseotherwise,itcaneasilybereformulatedslightlyinorderto\nmeet your objections.17\nScriven seems to express both moderate and then strong\n218TRUDYGOVIER charity in this passage. Thomas is similar, saying that charity\nmakes sense in terms of kindness to authors and personal\nstrategy.18AdifferentapproachistakenbyJonathanAdler.19He\nproposes that charity be adopted for epistemic reasons.\nWhether the reasons underlying interpretive charity are\nethical, prudential, epistemic, or a combination of these, it is\nclear that on these accounts charity is seen as an option at the\npractical level,ratherthanabroadlytheoreticalnecessity.Tofail\nto employ strong or moderate charity would not be to lose our\ngrip on understanding altogether, but rather (it is alleged) to do\nsomething unethical, imprudent, or epistemically inefficient.\nConsider the following example, found in a column on the\neastern bloc boycott of the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics.\nDiscussing the Soviet decision, columnist William Gold wrote\nthatthe1980MoscowOlympicswouldhaveservedtolegitimize\nMarxism in the eyes of communists around the world and that\nthe western boycott of those games had deeply hurt the Soviet\ngovernment of the day. He said that, though regrettable, the\ndecision to boycott the Los Angeles games was obviously\npreferable to the \u2018atomic frying of civilians\u2019. Adding several\ncomments about alternative prospects for the Olympics and\ninternational sports, Gold then wrote:\nTwo things are certain. The nuclear weaponry now in place will not\ndisappear. Even if arms control talks were to resume in earnest, the\nbest that could be hoped from them would be a reduction in the pace of\ngrowth.And the implacable hostility will not abate, either. Nor should\nit. Every free society has legitimate sympathy for those elsewhere who\nwould be free. Every totalitarian regime seeks dominion over its\nneighbors.Thisconflictisfundamental.Thechallengeofourtimesisto\npursue it through avenues that do not lead to the total war that will be\nunwinnable for all.In that quest, even the price of the Summer Games\nasnowconstitutedisnottoomuchtopay,andtherearemeansathand\nto minimize the loss.20\nThis passage poses interpretive questions at all four of the\nlevelsidentifiedearlier.IsGoldarguingthatthelossofthegames\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 219 isasmallpricetopay,onthegroundsthatwithnuclearweapons\nand international hostility a part of the scene, this price is so\nmuch lower than alternative costs? Or is he merely saying this,\nwith the points about nuclear weapons and international\ncompetition included as interesting and important background?\nThere are no indicator words in the passage, and the many\nparagraph breaks could be interpreted as evidence that no line\nof reasoning is being put forward. On the other hand, the words\n\u2018in that quest\u2019 in the final paragraph provide some evidence that\nthe author links that boycott of the Summer Games to the\n\u2018implacable conflict\u2019 he has described and intends somehow to\nreason from the nature of the latter to the reasonableness of\nsacrificing the former. The statements can naturally be arranged\ninto an argument and Gold seems definite and categorical in\nhis assertions, suggesting that he takes what he has to say very\nseriously.\nIf Gold is arguing, what are his premises? Would his comment\nabout totalitarian regimes be a premise for his view on the\nOlympics, or not? It is easy to falsify the claim that every\ntotalitarian regime seeks domination over its neighbors. (To cite\na case, Albania in the 1980s was a totalitarian regime, and did\nnot.) Gold says that nuclear weaponry \u2018will not disappear\u2019 and\nthat implacable hostility \u2018will not abate\u2019. Does he mean \u2018never\u2019\nor \u2018not in the foreseeable future\u2019? If the former, the claim is far\ntoostrongtobeverifiedandfortyyearsexperiencewithnuclear\nweapons would be very thin evidence for it; the author would\nsurely have an unacceptable premise, on this interpretation.\nIfweregardthiscolumnasexpressinganargument,therewill\nbealternativewaysofconstruingthestructureofthatargument.\nAre there missing premises that superpower hostility must be\nexpressed and that either war or such tit-for-tat manoeuvres as\nhappened with the 1980 and 1984 Olympics are the only ways\nthat conflict can be expressed?\n220TRUDYGOVIER We can usefully look at this passage as providing an example\nof the issues to which a principle of charity in argument\ninterpretation is applied. The problem is not that we fail, as yet,\ntograspthetribalcustomofwritingnewspapercolumns,orthat\nwe cannot determine whether the columnist is an intentional\nsystem. It is not that we fail to understand what \u2018Moscow\u2019, \u2018Los\nAngeles\u2019, and \u2018Olympics\u2019 refer to. Rather, there are more specific\nissues arising in this particular case about how strongly to take\nthe terms \u2018will not\u2019 and \u2018every\u2019, and about whether the discourse\nis intended as an argument. Charity would move us in the\ndirectionofinterpretingthepassageasanonargument.Itwould\npush us toward taking problematic terms in such a way that\nsomething qualified and thus relatively plausible is stated. For\n\u2018The nuclear weaponry now in place will not disappear\u2019, we\nwould read \u2018The nuclear weaponry now in place will not\ndisappear in the foreseeable future\u2019, or something similar. For\n\u2018Every totalitarian regime\u2019 we would read \u2018most totalitarian\nregimes\u2019, and so on.\nA consideration of this example provides a vivid illustration\nof why a general account of charity cannot plausibly be derived\nfrom ethical, prudential, or epistemic principles. First, consider\nthe matter of ethics. The columnist is an influential person; his\naudience is potentially 100,000 readers or more; he usually\nwrites clearly and well and is a respected commentator on local,\nnational,andinternationalaffairs.Ononereading,heisclaiming\nthat a nuclear arms stand-off between the superpowers is a\npermanent aspect of life. His comments, on one quite natural\ninterpretation, entail that a change in the nuclear situation is\nimpossible ever. On another they entail that it is impossible in\nourtime.Onyetanother,wemaytaketheclaimtoapplyonlyto\nthenexttenortwentyyears.Theunclarityoftheclaimishighly\nsignificant. The ambiguity may lead people to accept the claim,\ntakingaweakerinterpretationonwhichitisplausible.Theymay\nthen confusedly accept the stronger claim because they fail to\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 221 notice the equivocation. Given the seriousness of the issue and\nthe size of his audience this columnist can influence, it is most\nimplausible to say that our ethical obligation is to assume that\nthe columnist meant to assert whichever one of these claims is\nmost likely true. Far from having an ethical obligation to take\nthe most plausible interpretation, in any context in which we\nwere analyzing this argument and had a substantial audience\nourselves, we would have an ethical obligation to point out the\nlack of clarity and the fact that, on the very strongest\ninterpretation, there is little reason to think the claims are true.\nThe columnist\u2019s substantial audience may be lulled by the\nambiguity into giving credence to the boldest claim despite the\nfactthatitisassertedwithnosupportingevidence,andisalmost\ncertainly false. The matter is of considerable political\nsignificance.\nIfapersonmakesambiguous orunclearremarks, whatis\u2018fair\u2019\nto him is to tactfully point out the unclarity. But if one assumes\nan ethical perspective on interpretive charity, that takes us\nbeyond the arguer himself to broader ethical considerations.\nThese may involve policy, principles, events, and other affected\npersons. A maximally charitable version of discourse is not\ndemanded for ethical reasons. In contexts sufficiently serious,\nethics may indicate quite the reverse.\nNor does prudence clearly indicate opting for the most\nplausible interpretation in such a case; this will depend on our\nrelevant purposes and interests. Where prudence leads will\ndepend on what we are doing, who our analysis is for, whether\nthe arguer is present or absent, how sharp the arguer is, and\nmany other things. If the arguer is absent, and our purpose is to\nconvinceourownaudienceofapointofviewdifferentfromhis,\nprudence alone could indicate taking a minimally sympathetic\nreading of an argument and dismissing it quickly.\nThus, ethical and prudential considerations will not always\n222TRUDYGOVIER recommend charity. Although moderate charity may well be an\nappropriateprincipleofinterpretation,wecannotderiveitfrom\nthese sources. At best, their principles would indicate charity in\nsome contexts.\nNor is an epistemic approach much better for this purpose.\nJonathanAdler,inanessayentitled\u2018WhyBeCharitable?\u2019,locates\ntheprincipleofcharityinthebroadcontextoftheepistemicgoal\nof seeking truth. Adler says:\nIfthestudyofinformallogicisconstruedaswithinthetheoryofinquiry,\nthen it should seek analyses and evaluations that bring us closer to the\ntruth.Presumablythisimpliesthatwewanttomaximizetruth-relevant\nor epistemically relevant considerations over pragmatic or ethical ones\nin defending certain approaches, rules, or principles.The Principle of\nCharity should be justified, at least as a first try, as significant for\nfinding out whether the conclusion is correct, given the premises, rather\nthanmerelywinningtheargument.Wewanttoformulateargumentsat\ntheirbestorgreateststrengthbecausethatmakestheevaluationamore\n\u2018severe\u2019test.Themoreseveretest\u2013astrongerstatementoftheargument\n\u2013 is more likely to reveal falsity (failure of the line of reasoning than a\nless severe one)(weaker statement of the argument).21\nAdler recommends charity in argument interpretation on the\ngrounds that argument interpretation and analysis are part of\ninquiry and the purpose of inquiry is to find truth. He endorses\nthe Popperian view that truth is found by severe criticism.\nCriticismtestsmostrevealinglywhenhypothesesareformulated\nas strongly as possible.\nSeveral background assumptions are open to question in this\naccount. Adler seems to mean by \u2018theory of inquiry\u2019 the\nphilosophy of science and epistemology. It is not clear that\ninformallogicorthetheoryofargumentisproperlypartofthese\nsubjects.Keytopicsaredifferentandsoistherangeofexamples.\nMost questionable is Adler\u2019s belief that argument interpretation\nand evaluation have as their purpose the determination of the\ntruthoftheconclusion.Ifthepurposeofargumentanalysiswere\nto determine whether the conclusion is true, we would analyze\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 223 arguments by bringing forward everything we knew that was\npositively or negatively relevant to the conclusion. There would\nbe no need to interpret stated premises or to restrict ourselves\nto the reasoning used by the arguer. In fact, on this view, it\nis hard to see why interpretation of other people\u2019s discourse is\npart of argument analysis at all, except to extract conclusions\nwhich we go on to consider from our own point of view. The\nstated premises would be pertinent only insofar as we may find\nthem acceptable or they may remind us of something else that\ncountsinfavouroftheconclusion.Adlerqualifieshisaccountby\nnoting that we are trying to determine whether the conclusion\nis true, \u2018given the premises\u2019. For this latter purpose, which better\napproximates the purpose of argument evaluation, charity may\nbe important. But it is unclear that it can be rationalized\nepistemically.\nA major problem for Adler\u2019s epistemic account of interpretive\ncharity is that interpretive canons are to be applied in\ndetermining what the premises are. This is a different aspect of\nevaluationfromthelogico-epistemictaskofdeterminingwhether\na conclusion is true, given the premises. Charitable alterations of\nstated premises or supplementations of stated premises will not\ngiveagoodestimateofwhethertheconclusionistrue,\u2018giventhe\npremises\u2019.Itwillshowwhethertheconclusionistruegivensome\nslightly or dramatically different premises, which is something\nelse entirely. Charity is working in the wrong place for Adler\u2019s\nepistemic rationale to apply properly. We have yet to find a\nsuitable rationale for the charity so commonly urged as a basis\nfor argument interpretation.\nA problem with Scriven\u2019s classic account of charity for\nargument interpretation concerns his directive to search for the\nbest interpretation. This directive itself may be interpreted in\nseveralways.Whatisbest?Scrivenmaymeanonlythatweshould\ninterpret discourse carefully, paying close attention to nuances\nof meaning, possible irony and ridicule, aspects of context, and\nso on. This sort of charity, which I would call truistic charity, is\n224TRUDYGOVIER unproblematic. Of course we should appreciate such aspects of\ndiscourse;noonehasdeniedit.Attheoppositeextremeisstrong\ncharity. Urging us to find the best interpretation, Scriven may\nmean to find that interpretation according to which the passage\nemerges as the most plausible and rationally ordered. It could\nappear either as an nonargument or as the best argument we\ncould get out of it. This interpretation is suggested by Scriven\u2019s\nphrase \u2018make it mean something that a sensible person would be\nmore likely to have really meant\u2019. The expression \u2018make it mean\u2019\nrather suggests that we would be prepared to ignore empirical\nindicators of implausible assertions or faulty reasoning so as to\nmake a passage out as more rational than it first appears to be.\nThe pitfalls of ignoring or discounting pertinent empirical\nevidence are evident here, just as they are in the contexts\ndiscussed by Thagard and Nisbett. This strong charity would\napparently license considerable deletion, addition, and\nclarificationinordertogenerateplausible,relevantpremisesand\naccurate reasoning. It has been applied by some conscientious\nphilosophers with enormous energy, as Ralph Johnson pointed\nout in his well-known essay, \u2018Charity Begins at Home\u2019.22 Strong\ncharityforcesonlogiciansandcriticstheobligationtoconstruct\ngood arguments from sketchy and insignificant materials, an\nonerous task they may rightly resist, and one which may only\ndisguise or whitewash the genuine carelessness and stupidity\nwhich are sometimes present in real discourse.\nI contend then that strong charity is just as problematic in\nargumentinterpretationasitisinbroaderphilosophicalcontexts.\nThere may be much empirical evidence in favor of the not-so-\ncharitable alternative interpretation. Strong charity licenses too\nmuch alteration of the data. It courts misunderstanding and\nethnocentrism insofar as making others out to be sensible\namounts, in practical terms, to making them out to agree with\nus. Strong charity in argument interpretation might be\nrecommended for some limited purposes and in some special\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 225 contexts, but it will not be satisfactory as a general, over-riding\ninterpretive principle.\nApplying charity to Scriven\u2019s explanation of charity, what is\nmostlikelyisthatheintendedtorecommendsomethingbetween\ntruistic and strong charity. I would term this moderate charity.\nWhen other indicators (context, logical pattern, professed\nintention, indicator words) count equally in favour of several\ndistinctinterpretations,weadopttheonethatgeneratesthemost\nplausible argument.\nObviously, moderate charity needs further explanation. What\nare all these other indicators? What do we do in the typical case\nwhere they do not count exactly equally for several distinct\ninterpretations? What is the most plausible argument, if we have\nto choose between a version with unacceptable premises and\ngoodreasoning,andaversionwithacceptablepremisesandpoor\nreasoning? We still need a more precise expression of moderate\ncharity for argument analysis. And, seeing that ethical,\nprudential, and epistemic foundations are unpromising as a\nrationale for charity, we need an account of moderate charity\nthatwilltelluswhyitisanappropriateinterpretiveprinciplefor\nargument assessment. Beginnings of such an account are offered\nbelow.\n3. A Preliminary Account of Moderate Charity\nIn\u2018LogicandConversation\u2019H.P.GricesetsforthaCooperative\nPrinciple for discourse. He points out that exchanges do not\nnormally consist of a succession of disconnected remarks. They\nrequire some cooperative effort and purpose. Because there is\nalways some minimum of common purpose, there are some\npossible conversational moves that would not be suitable.\nWe might then formulate a rough general principle which participants\nwill be expected (ceteris paribus) to observe, viz. \u2018Make your\nconversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which is\n226TRUDYGOVIER occurs,bytheacceptedpurposeordirectionofthetalkexchangeinwhich\nyou are engaged.\u2019 One might label this the Cooperative Principle (CP).23\nOne purpose of conversational exchange is to have a\nmaximally effective exchange of information; Grice notes that\nthis,althoughanimportantpurposeofdiscourse,isnottheonly\nsuch purpose. Given it, we might derive a number of maxims\nparticipants should follow. Grice proposes these:\nMake your contribution as informative as is required (for the current\npurposes of the exchange).\nDo not make your contribution more informative than is required. Do\nnot say what you believe to be false.\nDonotsaythatforwhichyoulackadequateevidence.Avoidobscurityof\nexpression\nAvoid ambiguity.\nBe relevant.\nand a number of others. Human \u2018talk exchanges\u2019 are a type of\nrationalpurposivebehavior,andthesemaximsarereasonableto\nfollow, given the aims we have.\nAs is well known, Grice uses his account of logic and\nconversation to give an explanation of the pragmatic\nparadoxicality of Moore\u2019s \u2018it\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019, and\nthe differences between truth functional connectives and the\nordinary language \u2018meaning\u2019 of related terms. Aspects of the\naccount are suggestive for charity as well, though Grice himself\ndid not discuss this subject.24\nGrice\u2019s Principle of Cooperation is formulated so as to focus\nprimarily on one partner in the conversational exchange: the\nspeaker.Ifweconsiderargumentativeexchangeasaspecialcase\nof conversational exchange, and adopt the perspective of the\naudience rather than that of the speaker (or arguer), we can\ngenerate a principle of charity as a particular application of the\nPrinciple of Cooperation.\nWhat is an argumentative exchange? It is a discussion (spoken\nor written) in which parties are setting forth reasons to support\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 227 theirbeliefsandopinions,usuallyinordertorationallypersuade\nor convince each other. These arguments are related, at least\nin the sense that the beliefs and opinions are about the same\nsubject,andideallyinthefurthersensethattheargumentsofone\nparticipantareatleastsometimesaresponsetothoseofanother.\nThepurposesofanargumentativeexchangearetocommunicate\ninformation,beliefs,andopinions,topersuadeothersbyreasons\nthat one\u2019s own beliefs and opinions are true or acceptable, and\nto check and, if necessary, revise one\u2019s own beliefs and opinions\nthrough rational evaluation. Thus, in arguing we have a social\npractice of presenting and mutually evaluating evidence and\nreasons for our claims and beliefs. We offer arguments and\nconsiderargumentstodefendandrationallyconsiderclaimsand\nbeliefs. We defend beliefs primarily in order to persuade others\nthat they are true, and we attend to other people\u2019s arguments\nfrom reciprocity and a desire to find out whether we should be\npersuaded by what they have to say. This is the major point of\narguing, just as exchanging information is the major point of\nconversation.\nThisisnottosaythatevery casewhereanargumentappearsis\na case where the arguer genuinely wishes to rationally persuade\na rationally critical audience. Rather it is to say that the practice\nor social institution of argument has this as its typical function\nor purpose. The point is not straightforwardly empirical, but\nconceptual and normative. Argument as a social practice exists\nso that we may mutually communicate and amend our beliefs,\naswarrantedbysharedreasonsandevidence.Writtenargument\nspreads this process over a broader audience and longer time\nspan than spoken audience. It makes audience response less\ncertainandimmediatethaninspeechcontexts.Nevertheless,the\npossibility of such response is always there, and good written\nargumentation is attentive to this fact. On this account, written\nargument and criticism may be seen as a derivative of spoken\ndiscussion.\nFrom such a conception of argumentative practice, we may\n228TRUDYGOVIER derive a principle of charity, just as Grice derived his\nCooperative Principle from his concept of the normal function\nofconversation.Theprincipleofcharitywilldirecttheaudience\nto interpret an arguer\u2019s discourse in a way that will conform\nto the purpose of arguing and considering arguments. Such a\nprinciple will direct us to interpret the discourse of others so as\ntocontributetotheargumentativeexchange.Wepresume,other\nthings being equal, that others are participating in the social\npractice of rational argumentation. That is, they are trying to\ngive good reasons for claims they genuinely believe, and they\nare open to criticism on the merits of their beliefs and their\nreasoning. They are operating within the purpose of the\nexchange: that is, it is their purpose to communicate\ninformation, acceptable opinions and reasonable beliefs, and to\nprovide good reasons for some of these opinions and beliefs by\noffering good arguments. If we make this presumption, then if\nthere is an ambiguity in the discourse, and we can interpret it\neither as well reasoned or as poorly reasoned, we will opt for\nthemoresensibleinterpretation.Theassumptionthatpeopleare\ntrying to put forward good reasons for claims that they believe\nprovides a basis for moderate charity in the social practice of\nargument and its functional prerequisites.\nOn this view, the basis for charity is to be found not in ethics,\nprudence, or epistemology, but in the nature and purpose of\nthe activity in which participants are engaging: argument. That\npeople are exchanging what they take to be good reasons for\ntheir views when they appear to be is a rebuttable presumption.\nIf we presume their participation, a moderately charitable\napproach to what they say is indicated, as an application of the\nPrinciple of Cooperation. If for one reason or another, the\npresumption would not be appropriate \u2013 some persons lack all\ncredibility, others may be significantly handicapped, or the\ncontext may be one in which people seek to persuade with no\nregard for the quality of reasons and evidence, then there is no\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 229 justificationforapproachingthediscoursecharitably\u2013noteven\nmoderately charitably.\nA principle of charity that is rationalized in this way is\nmoderate, not strong. Given the purpose of argumentative\ndiscourse, that must be the case: the purpose of argumentative\nexchange is the defense and discussion of conflicting or\npotentiallyconflictingopinionsandbeliefs.(Typicallywedonot\nargueforbeliefsuponwhichweandouraudiencealreadyagree.)\nThe very concept of argument implicitly refers to disagreement\nbetweenparties.Hencestrongcharity,wherewewouldinterpret\nothers as making true or well-warranted claims contrary to\nempiricalevidence,wouldunderminethepurposeofthepractice\nof argument. In any event strong charity is flawed in several\nfundamentalrespects.First,itlicensestoomuchmanipulationof\nempirical evidence which would support imputations of false or\nimplausible beliefs, or flawed reasoning. Second, it puts at risk\nthe \u2018otherness\u2019 of other minds by directing us to find in others\u2019\nbeliefs and reasoning which are \u2018correct\u2019 and thereby similar to\nour own. Third, it prevents us from trying to correct beliefs or\nimprove arguments, since we are committed to interpreting all\narguments as sensible to begin with. The problem with strong\ncharity could be stated this way: it makes the presumption of\nrationality in others overbearing instead of having it function as\none interpretive factor among others.\nThe pull between charity and other factors can be seen in\nthis account of argumentative discourse. Its primary purpose is\nan interchange of evidence and reasons for beliefs. This notion\npresumes that minds are interacting with other minds. We allow\nthe possibility of revising our own beliefs and our own\nreasoning. Strong charity directs us to find true or plausible\nbeliefs, and to interpret so as to find good reasoning. In effect,\nthiswillbethesameasinterpretingsoastomaximizeagreement\nwith our own beliefs and our own standards of reasoning.\nNecessarily, we determine truth, plausibility, and accuracy of\nreasoning according to our own standards. Thus, the idea that\n230TRUDYGOVIER other beliefs, controversial from our own point of view, may\nbe encountered in an argumentative exchanged, is jeopardized\nwhen charity is strong. If we insist on interpreting others so as\nto make them out as correct by our standards, this aspect will\ndisappear.\nGrice\u2019s idea of cooperation is useful here. By communicating\nand rationally scrutinizing evidence and reasons for beliefs\ndifferent from our own, argumentative exchanges allow us to\ncooperatewiththosewhomaydiffer.Tosacrificethis\u2018otherness\u2019\nwould defeat the purpose of the exchange. By applying the\nCooperativePrinciple,wearriveatmoderatecharityratherthan\nstrong charity. If we focus on communication between different\nselves and on allowing the revision of our own views, we find\nreason to allow that others may make statements that we do not\nfind plausible, or use reasoning that we regard as flawed. We\npresume that others who participate in the practice of argument\nand rational discussion intend to convey sensible claims and to\nsupport these claims with well-reasoned arguments. We also\npresumethattheymaydifferfromus.Otherarguersregardtheir\nbeliefs and arguments as sound; we may or may not. We do\nnot have to agree to understand. The charity that emerges is\nmoderate charity.\nModerate charity directs us not to interpret others as having\nmadeimplausibleclaimsorfaultyinferencesunlessthereisgood\nempirical reason to do so. Empirical reason is provided in the\nfirst instance by the wording of the discourse and also by the\ncontext in which the discourse appears and background\nknowledge pertaining to the arguer. If the arguer has known\ninterests or prejudices, this may also affect our interpretation of\nhisorherclaimsandreasons.Ifsomeonewritestotheeditorand\nsays:\nCalgary is an unfriendly city, because the people at the zoo were very\nunfriendly to me when I was there.\nthere is a good empirical reason to see him as having offered an\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 231 argumentinwhichtheinferenceishasty.Theempiricalevidence\nthat there is an argument is first of all his use of \u2018because\u2019, a\nlogical indicator, and secondly the context of the letter to the\neditor,whichisoneinwhichpeopletypicallyexpressstrongheld\nopinionsandtrytoconvinceothersthatthesearetrue.Moderate\ncharity allows us to interpret the discourse this way, because\nthere are sound empirical reasons for doing so. We allow that,\nalthough on reflection we do not find the inference sound, the\narguer might deem it sound. Or, more likely, he might simply\nhave been careless.25\nThe presumption made in argumentative discourse is one of\nreasonable participation in the specific exchange, not of\nubiquitous rationality according to our own standards of what\nrationality is. Such a presumption is sufficient for the purpose\nof the discourse and for other philosophical purposes. It is a\npresumption that can be defeated. When it is, the rationale even\nfor moderate charity will disappear. When relevant empirical\nevidence does not determine one or another interpretation and\nmoderate charity is indicated, we adopt that interpretation\naccording to which the claims made are most plausible and the\ninferences most reasonable.\nAn example can be found in a dispute between Atomic Energy\nofCanadaandtheManitobagovernmentconcerningthestorage\nofradioactivewastesindeepundergroundvaults.Inresponseto\ntheManitobagovernment\u2019sstatementthattheAECLhadoffered\nnoevidencethestoragewassafe,AECLpresidentJamesDonnelly\nreplied that all evidence shows that \u2018reactor wastes, which will\nremain highly radioactive for almost as long as mankind has\nwalked the earth, can be safely disposed of deep in underground\nvaults.\u201926 An issue of charity arises here concerning the meaning\nof the key word \u2018safe\u2019. It might be taken to mean \u2018poses no risk\nat all of harm to humans or the environment\u2019 or alternately to\nmean\u2018posesonly a small, acceptable risk ofharmtohumansorthe\nenvironment\u2019.IfweregardDonnellyassomeonewhoissincerely\nparticipating in an argumentative exchange here, and apply\n232TRUDYGOVIER moderate charity to his remarks, we would take \u2018safe\u2019 in the\nsecondsense,sincehisclaimhasabetterchanceofbeingtrueon\nthat interpretation.\nAnother example was discussed in Ralph Johnson\u2019s paper on\ncharity. It goes like this:\nCats are free spirits, the last really independent creatures around. You\ncannomorelicensecatsthanyoucanlicensethewind.Dogsmaysubmit\nto bureaucracy. Cats won\u2019t. The same spirit tends to rub off on cat\nowners. They have enough trouble being pushed around by their cats\nwithout being asked to submit to man-made laws. Besides, there\u2019s an\neconomicfactor.They\u2019veneverhadtobuylicenses,sowhystart?No...it\njust won\u2019t work.27\nIn this passage, there seems to be an argument for the\nconclusion that a policy of licensing cats won\u2019t work. Two\npremises, stated near the end, are that cat owners will oppose\nlicensing due to previous freedom and that cat owners will\nopposelicensingduetocosts.Thereareseveralfurtherelements\nin the passage which might be taken as humorous flourishes or\nmight be regarded as serious parts of the argument. Two are\n\u2018You can no more license cats than you can license the wind\u2019,\nand\u2018They(owners)haveenoughtroublebeingpushedaroundby\ntheir cats without being asked to submit to man-made laws\u2019. As\nforthecat-windconnection,wemighttakeitasaseriousanalogy\nintended to support the statement that cats are free spirits, in\na sub-argument. However, it would be a tenuous analogy to be\nsure. We might take the comment about owners being pushed\naround as a premise in a sub-argument supporting the\nunderlying idea that owners will be opposed to licensing. But\ntaking this literally is implausible: the domination of owners\nby cats seems deliberately exaggerated as a kind of mild joke.\nThe claim, as stated, would not be acceptable if taken literally.\nSimilarly, we may ask how to read \u2018Cats are free spirits, the\nlast really independent creatures around\u2019. It does seem to be a\ncrucial premise in the argument that cats are free spirits, but\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 233 should we take \u2018the last really independent creatures around\u2019\nreally seriously? (If we do, it is easily vulnerable to objections\n\u2014 for example, robins and sparrows are around, and they seem\nfree.) The phrase might alternatively be interpreted as a\nrhetoricalflourishtoemphasizetheauthor\u2019smainassertionthat\ncats are free spirits.\nApplying moderate charity to the passage, we would avoid\ncommittingtheauthortothesub-argumentbasedonananalogy\nbetween cats and the wind and we would take the other two\nelements as literary flourishes not intended to make literal\nsubstantive claims. The passage as stated provides no indication\nthat these elements are to be regarded as parts of serious\nargumentation or as substantive claims. If taken as such, they\nwouldbeveryvulnerabletocriticism.Furthermore,afairlyclear\nargument can be extracted from the passage without including\ntheseelementsaspartsandno\u2018forced\u2019approachtothediscourse\nisrequiredinordertodothis.Appliedtothispassage, moderate\ncharity would yield the following argument:\n1. Cats are free spirits.\n2. Cat owners will oppose licensing cats.\n3. Catownerswillresistpayingtolicensecatswhentheyhave\nnot had to pay before.\nSo,\n4. Licensing cats would not work.\nLet us now return to William Gold\u2019s passage on Cold War\nrelations and the Olympics and employ an interpretive strategy\nofmoderatecharity.Therearenoindicatorwordsinthepassage.\nNevertheless, it seems natural and easy to arrange it as a\nstructured argument. Gold states as certainties two basic claims\n\u2013firstthatnuclearweaponrywillnotdisappearandsecondthat\nthehostilitybetweenthesuperpowerswillnotabate.(Onemight\ntry to water down these claims, to make them more plausible,\n234TRUDYGOVIER butthiswouldbeashifttostrongcharityandwouldignoreclear\ntextual evidence. The author after all, starts out by categorically\nsaying \u2018Two things are certain\u2019, and these are the two things.)\nForthesesupposedlycertainclaims,Goldofferssomesupportin\neach case \u2013 nuclear weaponry will not disappear because even\nsuccessful arms control talks would issue at best in a reduction,\nand hostility will not abate because free societies sympathize\nwith those wanting freedom and totalitarian regimes seek\ndomination over their neighbours. Gold then makes the further\nclaim that the conflict is fundamental \u2013 supported by the\nconsiderations about unabated hostility between freedom and\ntotalitarianism. He adds that the conflict must be pursued short\nof total war. From this he infers that the price of the Summer\nGamesisnottoohigh,especiallyconsideringthatthelosscanbe\nminimized.(Doweneedamissingpremisehere,totheeffectthat\nsacrificingtheSummerGamesistheonlysafewaytopursuethe\nhostilityatthetimeofwriting?Ifso,thiswillgiveanothereasily\nrefutedpremise.We\u2019llignorethisproblemforthemoment,butit\ndoes arise.) We could easily set out this passage as an argument.\n1. The nuclear weaponry now in place will not disappear.\n2. Even the most successful arms control talks would only\nreduce the amount of nuclear weaponry.\n3. Implacable hostility between the superpowers will not and\nshould not disappear.\n4. Every free society has legitimate sympathy for those who\nwant to be free.\n5. Every totalitarian regime seeks domination over its\nneighbors.\n6. The conflict between free societies and totalitarian regimes\nis fundamental.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 235 7. The conflict between free societies and totalitarian regimes\nmust be pursued short of total war.\n8. There are means to minimize the loss of the Summer\nOlympic Games.\nTherefore,\n9. The loss of the Summer Olympic Games is not too high\na price to pay for the benefit of pursuing the fundamental\nconflict between superpowers.\nThere are several sub-arguments. (2) is offered to support (1);\n(4) and (5) are offered to support (3); then (1), (3), (6), (7), and\n(8) link so as to support (9). The argument will turn out to be\nseriously flawed, due to its containing in an essential role easily\nfalsified premises, and due to the gap between the combined\npremises and the specific conclusion about the Games. (We\ncould eliminate the gap by adding a premise, but were we to do\nso new problems would only arise because that premise would\nbe easily shown false.) That is, strong charity would have to\noutweighempiricalevidencewhichpointsquiteunambiguously\nin one direction, in this case. Moderate charity will not do this.\nThe passage should thus be seen as expressing an argument \u2013\none that is flawed.\n4. Concluding Comments\nOne objection to the above account of the purpose of arguing\nandthebasisofmoderatecharitymightbethatitistooidealistic,\nseeing arguers and listeners as more honorable than they in fact\nare. It focuses too much on rationality and too little on\npersuasion. It might be urged that some arguers do not intend\nto persuade their audience by offering good reasons but rather\nto persuade their audience by offering whatever is likely to be\neffective. They intend only a result, and may care nothing for\nreasoned argument or plausibility of claims as a means to that\nresult. It must be admitted that this is often the case.\n236TRUDYGOVIER Advertisements and political propaganda are important cases in\npoint. Even in less manipulative contexts, there are some\ndiscussants who seek only to manipulate opinion in this way.\nSometimesanimmediateneedissoimportant,orthepossibility\nofmorerationallybasedpersuasionsoremotethatsuchmethods\nmay be ethically justifiable.\nGilbert Ryle once argued that we can have counterfeit coins\nonly if we have, or have had, real money. John Austin said that\npeople are able to pretend only if the real thing is known and\nunderstood.28 In an analogous way, propaganda and other\nmanipulative persuasion may get their point from genuine\nargumentation and reasoning. We may erroneously take\nnonrational persuasion, expressed in the trappings of rational\npersuasion, to be a genuine case of rational persuasion. Possibly\nour susceptibility to some of the forms of pseudo-rational\npersuasion is due to their facade of rationality. Discourse may\ncontain no reasoning or evidence and yet have the appearance\nof doing so. It may be put forward by someone whose sole goal\nis persuasion and who has no respect for canons of sound\nargumentation. Yet, its semantic surface may be that of genuine\nargumentation and its persuasive power due in part to that fact.\nForms of propaganda owe their success to the institution of\ngenuine argumentation.\nThe distinction between education and propaganda might be\ndrawn in these terms. The social practice of rational argument\nanddebateismorefundamentalthanpseudorationalpersuasion\nor propaganda, though they are profoundly important both in\nthemselves and with regard to their social and political\nconsequences. The present account of arguing stipulates the\npurpose of argumentative discourse as such, not the purpose or\nintention of every individual and institution engaging in it.\nBecause argumentative discourse has the purpose of rational,\nconsidered, reflective, and mutual persuasion, we presume in\nmost contexts that arguers have these purposes. If we obtain\nevidencetothecontrary,thentherationaleformoderatecharity\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 237 no longer applies. There is no reason to apply even moderate\ncharity to a twenty second television advertisement, because we\nknow that the writers and sponsors do not intend to persuade\nby reason, in this context. But until we have strong reason not\nto do so, we should assume that those engaging in what appears\nto be argumentative discourse are doing what they seem to be\ndoing, namely participating in the social institution of rational\npersuasion and reflection. On this assumption, we adopt a\nprinciple of moderate charity as a general guide in argument\ninterpretation.\nNotes\nThis essay benefitted from a discussion in the Philosophy\nDepartment at the University of Calgary in August, 1985\nespeciallyfromcommentsbyKaiNielsenandGertrudeEzorsky.\nIn addition, I would like to thank Jonathan Adler for his careful\nreading of an earlier version, and for his helpful and detailed\ncomments.\n1.

This point was suggested to me by Kai Nielsen.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 241 CHAPTER 8.\nREASONS WHY ARGUMENTS AND\nEXPLANATIONS ARE DIFFERENT\nBroadly speaking, the current consensus about the basic distinction\nis similar to that theme of this chapter. Argument and explanation are\ndifferent;generallytheydifferpragmatically.Reasoningisusedinboth,\nand the same indicator words are used in both.\nThis chapter represents my response to a challenge issued by S.N.\nThomas, who maintained on the basis of a number of tricky cases\nthat the argument/explanation distinction did not hold up to scrutiny.\nLooking back at the chapter many years later, I still find myself\nimpressed by the examples he put forward. I would agree now, as I did\nthen, that the distinction between argument and explanation is not an\nexclusiveone.It\u2019squitepossibleforthesamesetofstatementstoprovide\nboth an argument that a conclusion C is true and an explanation as\nto why it is (or how it came to be) that C should be true. Yet it is still\nthe case that argument and explanation differ from a pragmatic point\nof view. The \u2018why?\u2019 of explanation differs from the \u2018why?\u2019 of argument.\nExplaining, one will offer an account (usually causal) as to why or\nhow C came to be true. Arguing, one will cite reasons or evidence\npurporting to show that C is true. Explaining, one presumes general\nagreement about C; arguing one presumes the actuality or possibility\nof disagreement about C. Thomas maintained that the argument/\nexplanation distinction should be dispensed with because it could not\nbe drawn clearly and admitted too many borderline cases. Still more\n242TRUDYGOVIER significantly, he found cases that qualified both as argument and as\nexplanation and thus undermined the dichotomy. Working through\nsome of his challenging examples, I agreed that a passage could\nconstitute both argument and explanation but resisted renouncing the\ndistinction altogether on that account. In other words, I preserved the\nbinary but allowed that it was not exclusive.\nIn a 2010 article, \u201dArgument Explanation Complementarity and the\nStructure of Informal Reasoning\u201d Gregory Randolph Mayes similarly\nmaintained a distinction between argument and explanation. Mayes\nput it this way: in an argument, the conclusion is disputed; in an\nexplanation, the conclusion (or statement that would stand in the place\noccupiedbytheconclusion)isalreadyaccepted.Onecanaskjustwhoit\nisthatisreferredtoasacceptingordisputingclaimC.Mayesmaintains\nthatitisthearguer.Thearguercanofcoursegetthematterwrong.For\nexampleshemightsupposethatthepersonssheisaddressinggrantthat\nC and offer to them an explanation of C. If she is mistaken about that,\nthe explanation will not be appropriate. The audience could be lured\ninto supposing that C is true, or it could expect an argument and be\ndisappointedthatwhatthearguerhastoofferwillnotprovidejustifying\nevidence or reasons. Mayes is aware of such issues; nevertheless he\nsustains his view that the arguer\u2019s states of acceptance or doubt\ndetermine the argument or explanation status of her discourse.\nMayes offers lucid and interesting examples of how argument and\nexplanationmaybecombinedindiscourse.Forinstance,onemightcite\naclaimtosupportaconclusion(argument)andthenofferanaccountof\nhowthatclaimcametobetrue(explanation).Ashesays,argumentand\nexplanation can be complementary to each other in these sorts of cases.\nA 2017 article \u201cArgument or Explanation: Who is to Decide?\u201d\nappeared just as I was about to write this introduction. The author,\nMichel Dufour, points out that neither Thomas nor myself questioned\nthe exhaustiveness of the argument/explanation binary. (I had noted\na third alternative \u2014 descriptive discourse that is neither justificatory\nnor explanatory \u2013 in my textbook.) Dufour maintained that one does\nnot always find disagreement about the conclusion of an argument.\nI had actually acknowledged that one can look for an argument that\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 243 would justify a claim C even when one accepts C, as for example in\na context of inquiry. Dufour states that it is unclear who is to decide\nwhether a claim C is \u2018certain\u2019 enough to be explained instead of argued\nfor, and rejects the idea that the arguer himself or herself should hold\nauthority of that matter. Perhaps claim C is something that people\nneither agree nor disagree about. Perhaps they have barely considered\nthematter,ordonotcareenoughaboutittobother.Thenthepragmatic\ndistinctionswillnottakehold.Inthiscase,thebinaryisnotexhaustive.\nIs the discourse an argument or an explanation? The answer should be\nneither.\nPhilosophers have commonly distinguished between\narguments and explanations. In arguments, premises are stated\nin an attempt to prove, or justify, a conclusion. In explanations,\nstatements are made in an attempt to account for, or show the\ncause of, a state of affairs. Most introductory accounts of\nargument take this contrast for granted. Nevertheless, there are\na number of interesting and relatively unexplored issues about\nthe relation, similarities, and distinction between argument and\nexplanation.\nThe so-called logical indicator words \u2013 \u2018thus\u2019, \u2018therefore\u2019,\n\u2018since\u2019, \u2018because\u2019, \u2018so\u2019, and many others, are as common in\nexplanations as they are in arguments. Those which precede the\nconclusions in arguments may equally well precede what is\nexplained in an explanation. Here is an example:\nWhen censorship boards conduct their deliberations in secret, public\naccountability is lost. Public accountability is essential. Thus, such\nproceedingsshouldberecordedandpublicaccesstotherecordsshouldbe\nallowed.\nIn this example, \u2018thus\u2019 is used in its paradigmatic logical role,\npreceding the conclusion in an argument. But in other cases,\n\u2018thus\u2019 functions just as naturally in an explanation, as in:\nShe ate about the same amount as usual but got much more exercise,\n244TRUDYGOVIER running after the children and doing all the housework and gardening.\nThus she lost a lot of weight over the summer.\nHere the fact explained is preceded by \u2018thus.\u2019l Similarly, words\nlike \u2018because\u2019, \u2018since\u2019, and \u2018for\u2019, which are used to introduce\npremises in arguments, are also often used to introduce\nexplaining statements in explanations.\nAccording to the classic deductive-nomological account,\nexplanation is one type of argument.2 Although this account\nis now widely criticized, it was dominant in the philosophy of\nscience for several decades and still enjoys influence. Within\ninfluential circles in the philosophy of science, the notion of\nargument has been more or less taken for granted, with\narguments being understood as paradigmatically deductive. An\nespecially clear and intellectually important type is the\nsubsuming deduction: \u2018All As are Bs; this is an A; therefore this\nis a B\u2019. In the influential covering law model of scientific\nexplanation, scientific explanations are seen as having this form\n(atleast implicitly),sothateverycompletescientific explanation\nis at the same time a deductively valid argument. The relation\nbetween argument and scientific explanation has been studied\nlargely in the context of the issue of whether scientific\nexplanations can or should be made to fit this standard pattern\nor a statistical variation of it. (Most A\u2019s are B\u2019s; this is an A;\ntherefore this is most likely a B.) Although other types of\narguments, such as analogies and conductive arguments, might\nhave been explored for their potential as models for other types\nof scientific explanation, they were not. Nor does there seem to\nhavebeenanyattempttoexploremoresophisticatedcumulative\nargument structures as models for elaborate explanations.3\nThisinfluentialdiscussionoftherelationbetweenexplanation\nand argument appears impoverished if examined from the\nperspective of a richer and more sensitive theory of argument.\nNot all arguments are deductive unless one adopts a sweeping\nmissing premise policy that requires supplementing stated\npremises so as to make them deductively entail the conclusion.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 245 Furthermore, scientific explanations are not the only\nexplanations. The philosophical studies of scientific explanation\nand its relation to argument could profitably be broadened by\ngreater reference to explanation outside science as well as to\nnondeductive and cumulative patterns of argument.\nThe fact remains, however, that many serious and prominent\nthinkers retain the view that scientific explanations constitute a\ntype of deductively valid argument. The enduring influence of\nthis model provides one incentive to reexamine that textbook\ncontrast between argument and explanation.\nAnother incentive arises from pedagogical experience.\nInstructorsoftenfinditdifficulttoteachstudentsthedistinction\nbetweenexplanationandargument.Studentsfindthedistinction\nhard to grasp in theory and difficult to apply in practice. In a\nculture that does not emphasize the importance of providing\nsupporting reasons for one\u2019s claims, questions as to \u2018why?\u2019 are\noftentakenasrequestingexplanationsforhowpeoplehavecome\nto think as they do. Issues of justifiability may disappear. Such\ncrucial terms as \u2018why\u2019, \u2018reasons\u2019, and \u2018because\u2019 fit naturally into\nboth explanations and arguments. People may become\nunaccustomed to rational argument and find it hard to\nappreciate any contrast between requests to explain why one\nthinks as one does and requests, on the other hand, to provide\nrational support for one\u2019s claims.\nEvenwhenthedistinctionbetweenexplanationandargument\nis grasped in theory, many passages, real or invented, can be\ninterpreted as either explanation or argument. To illustrate this\nproblem, consider the following example, cited by S.N. Thomas:\nManagers who at an early stage showed much promise, career growth,\nandmobilitymayfindthemselvesclassifiedasnonpromotableforanyof\na dozen reasons \u2026 Once labeled nonpromotable, a person is frequently\nputonashelfandonlytoleratedwithinanorganization.There,thereis\nagreatpotentialforthedevelopmentofinsecurityandfearinamanager\nin an organization, since he has few legal rights for his protection and\n246TRUDYGOVIER mustdevelophimselfsothattheorganizationcontinuallyviewshimasa\nvaluable asset.\nThomas remarks of this passage:\nHerebothexplanationandjustificationseemtobegoingon.Theauthors\njustifytheirstatementthatthereisgreatpotentialforthedevelopmentof\ninsecurityandfearinamanagerinanorganizationbyexplaininghow\nand why this potential exists (a manager \u2018has few legal rights\u2019, he may\nbe \u2018classified as nonpromotable\u2018 and \u2018put on a shelf\u2019, etc.) The authors\njustifytheirstatementthatthissituationexistsbyshowingthefactsthat\nlead to, or cause, its existence.\nIn fact, Thomas finds such passages so prevalent that he rejects\nthedistinctionbetweenargumentandexplanationinhispopular\ntext.4 He sees himself as teaching students to identify,\nunderstand, and evaluate reasoning which, he says, appears both\nin \u2018justifications\u2019 (his word for what standard theory calls\narguments) and in explanations. Given the existence of\nborderline cases, and given that reasoning occurs both in\nexplanations and in \u2018justifications\u2019, Thomas makes the\nunorthodoxdecisiontousetheword\u2018argument\u2019broadlyenough\ntocoverexplanatoryreasoningaswellasjustificatoryreasoning.\nMost theorists seek to preserve a distinction between\nargument and explanation, even in the face of such difficulties.\nOne common approach brings in the relative uncertainty of the\nconclusion of an argument compared to its premises, and\ncontrasts this with the relative certainty of the explained fact\n(explanandum) in an explanation, as contrasted with that of the\nexplaining facts (explanans). In an argument, we typically try to\njustify a conclusion that is, in the context, in doubt. We state\npremisesthatweregardasmorecertainthantheconclusionand\ncapable of giving that conclusion rational support. We reason\nfrom the premises to the conclusion, and offer those premises\nto an audience on the supposition that they can support the\nconclusion \u2013 show that it is true, or acceptable. The pragmatic\ndirection in argument, then, is from premises to conclusion.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 247 Typically, premises are taken as given, or at least as more\nacceptable than the conclusion at the outset of the reasoning.\nThepointofarguingistorationallypersuadeanaudienceonthe\nbasis of these premises that the conclusion is true or plausible.\nThe pragmatics of explanation are quite different. We do not\nusually try to explain something unless we take it to be a\nphenomenon or fact. (There is no need to explain there being\n80% of males among human births in Canada in 1984, for this\nwas not a phenomenon.) To offer an explanation for some\nphenomenon is generally to presume that it is a genuine\nphenomenon. If it is not, there is nothing to explain. We do\nreason in explaining: we reason from presumed phenomena or\nregularities to the fact we are trying to explain. (\u2018It is because\nof <explanans> that <explanandum>.\u2019)5 If these explaining factors\nhold, then the fact we are seeking to explain would be\nunderstandable;itwould\u2018makesense\u2019.Sometimestheexplaining\nstatements are as well-known as the fact that is to be explained,\nbut sometimes they are not. In such cases, we may even employ\nour explanation in an abductive argument (inference-to-the-\nbest-explanation).\nRegarding argument and explanation, the central point is the\ncontrastinpragmaticdirection.Inanexplanation,theexplained\nstatement is as well-known as the explaining statements,\nperhaps better known. In an argument the premises cited as\njustification are typically better known than the conclusion.\nThus the relevant beliefs of arguers and explainers and their\nrespective audiences differ significantly. The \u2018certainty shift\u2019\noften is different: in an argument certainty moves from the\npremises to the conclusion, whereas in an explanation it either\ndoes not shift or shifts from the fact to be explained to the\nexplanatory hypothesis.\nIn Philosophical Explanations, Robert Nozick puts the contrast\nthis way:6\nA proof transmits conviction from its premises down to its conclusion,\nso it must start with premises (q) for which there is already conviction;\n248TRUDYGOVIER otherwise,therewillbenothingtotransmit.Anexplanation,ontheother\nhand, may introduce explanatory hypotheses (q) which are not already\nbelieved,fromwhichtodeducepinexplanatoryfashion.Successinthis\nexplanatory deduction may lend support and induce belief, previously\nabsent, in the hypothesis.\nNozick\u2019s preliminary version of the distinction between\nargument and explanation seems essentially correct, but the full\nstory is more complicated. Things are unfortunately rather\nmessier than Nozick\u2019s account suggests. It is not a necessary\ncondition of the occurrence of argument that the conclusion be\nin doubt. We may argue for conclusions that we already believe,\nfor example in contexts where we accept a claim but seek a\nconvincing justification for it. Nor is it strictly a necessary\ncondition of explanation that the explanandum be granted as a\nfact. Occasionally, explanations are offered for potentially true\nstatements. (\u2018If such and such were the case, it could be because\nofsoandso.\u2019)Transcendentalargumentscombineargumentand\nexplanation, in that a conclusion derived from a point about\nexperience or consciousness is supposed to explain the very\nphenomena that prove its necessity.7 Some arguments set out\nproofs in such order and detail that they not only demonstrate\nthat a conclusion is true, but at the same time serve to explain\nwhy it is true. On Nozick\u2019s account, this should be logically\nimpossible, as the demands on relative knowledge levels would\nbe contradictory.8 Nozick\u2019s pragmatic account, while plausible,\nstands in need of qualification and development.\n1.Looking at Thomas\u2019 Challenge\nIn the Instructor\u2019s Manual for the second edition of his text, S.N.\nThomas includes an interesting short essay defending and\nexplaininghisunorthodoxpedagogicalpolicyofabandoningthe\ndistinction betweenarguments andexplanations. Thomas offers\nfour basic reasons for his position.\n1. It is impossible to include all justificatory discourses within\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 249 the scope of logic while excluding all explanatory\ndiscourses. This is because many pieces of reasoning can\ndefensibly be classified \u2018as being both \u2018justificatory\u2019 and\n\u2018explanatory\u2019.\u2019 In fact, Thomas states, \u2018Many reasoned\ndiscourses in natural language are \u2018justificatory\u2019 and\u2019\nexplanatory\u2019 at the same time and on the same\ninterpretation.9 Thomas is not merely stating that many\npassages are hard to classify in that they could either be\nseen as justificatory or as explanatory. Rather, his point is\nthat many reasoned passages can correctly be seen as both\njustificatory and explanatory, where this duality is not a\nresult of semantic or structural ambiguities. An argument\nthat X is true may also constitute an explanation why X is\ntrue. Thomas speaks ofwhat is included and excluded from\nthe scope of logic because logic has traditionally regarded\nargumentasitsprimaryterritory.However,onemightagree\nthatlogicshouldincludethetaskofevaluatingthereasoning\nused in explanations and nevertheless wish to preserve the\ndistinction between explanation and argument.\n2. Thedistinctionbetweenjustificationandexplanationneeds\nto be based on extra-logical features of discourses such as\nfunction, social purpose, normal contexts, and beliefs of\nspeakers and writers. Such beliefs may vary from person\nto person and from situation to situation. If explanatory\ndiscourses are to be excluded from the scope of logic, their\nexclusion would depend on extra-logical and variable\nfactors. \u2018This dependency would be undesirable because the scope\nof logic should not fluctuate with extra-logical individual\npsychological variables. This is a reason both against trying to\nrestrict the scope of logic to \u2018justifications\u2019 and against trying\nto exclude some explanations on the grounds that they are\n\u2018nonjustificatory.\u201810\n3. Explanationsandjustificationsbothemployreasoning,and,\nThomas says, \u2018in both cases, a similar relationship should exist\n250TRUDYGOVIER between the components of the reasoning.\u201911 Since it is the task\nof logic to appraise reasoning, logic should thus deal with\nbothtypesofdiscourse.Intheclassichypothetico-deductive\nmodel of scientific explanation, explanations are regarded\nas arguments. Viewed in this way, explanations can be\nevaluated by \u2018the same logical criteria (of validity and\nsoundness) as justificatory discourse\u2019.\n4. It is better pedagogically to require students to distinguish\nreasoning from nonreasoning than to require them to\ndistinguish argument from nonjustificatory explanation.\nThis is because the relevant pragmatic factors are often not\nrevealed in the passages cited in textbooks and because\nborderline cases are so common. As a result, \u2018the boundary\nof the set of reasoned discourses (i.e. the boundary of the class of\nreasoneddiscoursesincludingbothjustificationsandexplanations)\nappears to be not only more relevant to logic, but is also much\nclearer than is the broad blurry boundary between justificatory\nandnonjustificatoryreasoning.\u201912\nWecanseeanumberofdistinctthemesinThomas\u2019schallenging\naccount. His idea that logic should encompass the appraisal of\nthe reasoning used in explanations can be accepted without\nrenouncing the distinction between explanation and argument.\nThe claim that many natural discourses are difficult to classify\nas either justificatory or explanatory, especially when taken out\nof context, is also quite acceptable and may be pedagogically\nimportant,thoughitdoesnotentailthatthedistinctionbetween\nexplanationandargumentshouldberelinquishedaltogether.To\nsaythatpragmaticfactorsarerequiredtoapplythedistinctionis\nquite consistent with the sort of account Nozick offers.\nThe central and most revisionary claims in Thomas\u2019s account\nreduce to two. First, the very same statements, on the same\ninterpretation, can constitute both an argument and an\nexplanation. Second, the very same logical criteria apply both to\nexplanations and to arguments. If these claims were true, then\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 251 any distinction between argument and explanation would\nindeed be relatively unimportant within logic, both\npedagogically and theoretically.\n2.Arguments that are not Explanations and Explanations that\nare not Arguments\nNo one has seriously claimed that all arguments are\nexplanations,thoughsomehaveclaimedthatallexplanationsare\narguments. For the sake of completeness, however, let us see\nwhy not all arguments are explanations. Consider the following\nexample:\n1. Jones is a Liberal.\n2. Jones is fat.\n3. Jones is a bachelor.\n4. therefore,\n5. Jones is a fat Liberal bachelor.\ntherefore,\n6. There are fat Liberal bachelors.\nHere (5) is conclusively proven, given the premises. But the\nphenomenon described in (5) is not explained.\nIn this argument, the conclusion generalizes on separate\nparticular facts, and these facts are not adequate to explain why\nit should be true. To explain something is to account for it, to\nshow how or why it came to be and why it is as it is. Typically,\nexplanations set a phenomenon in a broader context, either\nsubsuming it under a law, indicating one or more of its causes,\nshowing how it fits a pattern how it is similar to a case which\nis already well understood (analogy), or how it is somehow to\nbe expected given other factors that are understood. Many\n252TRUDYGOVIER arguments donotdothis,eventhoughtheyprovideevidenceor\nreasons to show a statement true or plausible. For this reason,\nexamples like the one just cited are easy to generate. Statements\ncanprove,orprovidegoodevidenceforaconclusion,C,without\nexplaining why C is true.\nThese are good arguments even by strict standards. The\nexampleabovedoubtless hastruepremises, anditisdeductively\nvalid. If interpreted as an explanation, this discourse would\nconstitute a very poor one. Thomas\u2019s claim that arguments and\nexplanations can be assessed by the same logical criteria can\nbe seen to be false. There are many uncontroversially good\narguments that are not explanations and that would be poor\nexplanations were they taken as explanatory.\nWesley Salmon presents a relevant case in a paper in which\nhearguesthatexplanationsarenotarguments.Hesupposesthat\nwe have good inductive evidence that doctors are experts at\npredicting which children will catch the measles.13 Given this,\nwe might argue some such thing as:\n1. Doctor Smith has predicted that Susan will catch the measles.\n2. Doctorsarealmostalwayscorrectwhentheypredictthatchildren\nwill catch the measles.\nTherefore, probably,\n3. Susan will catch the measles.\nHere we have a good inductive argument for (3), but we have\nno explanation of (3). It is not established that Susan will get the\nmeasles, although this is a reasonable thing to believe. Even if\nwe wanted to explain why Susan will probably get the measles,\nthe expertise of doctors would not be the right sort of factor to\nrefer to \u2013 exposure to others, or failure to get vaccinated would.\nSurelySusanwouldnotgetthemeaslesastheresultofadoctor\u2019s\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 253 prediction! The prediction is not a cause. Yet we have a good\ninductive argument for the claim that Susan will get the measles.\nA comparable point can be made about retroactive inductive\narguments. For instance, consider an argument from the\npresence of fossilized sea shells in Alberta today (S) to the claim\nthat there was once an immense sea covering Alberta (C). S,\nconjoinedwithinformationaboutthefossils,providesinductive\nevidence for C. Retrodictively, we may infer C from present\nfacts. S can give evidence for C in a retrodictive context just as\na comparable claim might provide evidence in a predictive\ncontext. Nevertheless, Scannot in such a context explain C. The\npoint is especially obvious in a retroactive argument, since the\ntemporal relations would not work for explanation.14 The\npresence of sea shells in Alberta in the present cannot possibly\naccount for there having been a sea there millions of years ago.\nSimilar points can be made about many inductive arguments.\nThe evidence cited may provide a good basis for belief in the\nconclusion without explaining that conclusion. Consider, as\nanother example, an inductive analogy citing effects on rats as a\nbasis for a predicted effect on humans. The evidence about rats\ncould not in principle explain such an effect on humans.\nReflecting in a mathematical context, Philip Kitcher endorsed\nthe distinction between argument and explanation, saying:\nthere are cases in which we have a rigorous argument from known\npremises, but in which we do not understand why the conclusion is true.15\nInsuchcases,wehaveargumentandnoexplanation.Andthere\nare many such examples. Thus many perfectly good arguments\nhave no prospects as explanations.\nThomas\u2019s claim that the same criteria can be used to appraise\nboth arguments and explanations cannot be correct. We need\na distinction between argument and explanation, and we need\ndifferent criteria of appraisal for each.\nPerhaps further conditions are needed for explanation. Or\n254TRUDYGOVIER perhaps the conditions of epistemic and logical appraisal are\nquite distinct. Some examples make it seem as though\nexplanation demands more than argument. It might be that\ngoodexplanationdemandsgoodargumentfortheexplanandum\nand more besides. This is the assumption behind deductive\nnomological accounts in which explanation is regarded as a\nspecial type of argument. However, for this thesis too, there\nare problems. The idea that explanation demands more than\nargument is falsified bythe fact that some potentiallyadequate\nexplanationsareutternon-starters asarguments.Considerthe\nfollowing, for instance:\n1. Smith is a communist sympathizer.\n2. Cuba is a communist state.\nThus,\n3. Smith\u2019s account of conditions in Cuba is flawed and biased.\nIf taken as premises offering support for (3), (1) and (2) would\ndo a poor job. If we were to appraise this reasoning as an\nargumentwewouldgiveitpoormarks,becausewewouldexpect\n(1) and (2) to give good evidence in support of (3) and they do\nnot. As an argument, this discourse is ad hominem and extremely\nweak. However, regarding the discourse as an explanation gives\na different result. Doing that, we regard (3) as a claim granted in\nadvance. If it is known or agreed that Smith\u2019s account is biased\nand we are trying to explain why it is biased, the fact that he is\na communist sympathizer offering an account of a communist\ncountry could provide the explanation.\nThomas follows logical tradition in regarding the ad hominem\nas a fallacy. But that view is not consistent with his claim that\nthe same appraisal standards apply both to arguments and\nexplanations, as this example reveals. In this sort of case, the\npragmatic difference regarding relative knowledge of the\n\u2018conclusion\u2019 orexplanandumis highly significant.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 255 Wesley Salmon provides another kind of example.17 We\nsometimes explain an event by citing a statistical law according\nto which that event has a low probability. For instance, the\nprobability that someone exposed to a particular dose of\nradiation gets leukemia may be less than 5%. Yet if he does get\nleukemiasomeyearsaftertheexposure,hisexposurewillbethe\nexplanation. A similar example, first cited by Michael Scriven,\nis that of the syphilis sufferer who gets paresis. Few syphilis\nsufferers get paresis, but for those who do, their being syphilis\nsufferersistheexplanation.Insuchcases,anargumentfromthe\nstatistical law to the occurrence of the event will be weak, for\ntheeventhasalowprobability ofoccurring,giventhestatistical\nregularity. Yet the regularity specifies the relationship that (by\ncurrentscientificstandards)explainstheevent.(Admittedly,that\nexplanationdoesseemweakandincomplete.)Wecanexplainthe\nphenomenon, knowing that it occurred. If we did not already\nknow that it had occurred, we could not argue that it would\noccur by citing such a regularity.\nNo account of reasoning and discourse which dispenses with\nthe distinction between argument and explanation is going to\nbe plausible, because there are many arguments that are not\nexplanations and there are many explanations that are not\narguments. Furthermore, an examination of cases indicates that\ndifferent criteria of appraisal must be at work. There are good\nargumentsthatwouldbenon-startersasexplanations,andgood\nexplanations that would be non-starters as arguments.\n3. Why Arguments are not Explanations\nThat some arguments are not explanations and some\nexplanationsarenotargumentsistobeexpected,giventhebasic\npragmatic asymmetry between argument and explanation. The\npurpose of argument is rational persuasion. A person puts\nforward an argument in an attempt to persuade an audience\nthat a claim is true on the basis of reasons or evidence that he\nor she provides in support of the claim. The claim is taken as\n256TRUDYGOVIER not accepted in advance of the argument\u2019s being stated, and as\nrendered acceptable in virtue of the fact that it is adequately\nsupported by the asserted premises. In an argument, an attempt\nis made to justify, or render rationally acceptable, a conclusion\non the basis of proffered premises. Since justifying evidence or\nreasons may in many cases not be of the appropriate type to\nexplain the phenomena cited in the conclusion \u2013 as in a number\noftheexamplescitedabove\u2013therearemanyargumentsthatare\nnot explanations.\nIn an explanation, an attempt is made to show how or why\nsomething came to be as it is. Since explaining a phenomenon\npresupposes that it occurred, explanatory factors are often not of\nan appropriate type to provide evidence that it did occur. The\nunderlying pragmatics of argument and explanation make the\nexistence of examples of arguments that are not explanations\nand explanations that are not arguments entirely intelligible.\nPragmatic differences explain the distinction.\nIt is true that we sometimes argue for conclusions that are\nnot in doubt \u2013 as when philosophers construct arguments for\nthe existence of external objects. Argument may be used here\nas an exploratory device \u2013 an instrument of inquiry, as several\nrecent authors have put it. This fact does not undermine the\nfundamentalpragmaticcontrast,though.18Suchargumentsmay\nbeunderstoodasattemptstoshowhowdoubtscouldberesolved\nweretheytooccur,andcanthusregardedasjustificatory.Theidea\nthat the premises should be better known than the conclusion\nis thus preserved. For example, an argument for the existence\nof external objects, based on premises presuming the existence\nof other minds, would be considered deficient because this\ncondition would not be met. The premises would not be \u2018better\nknown\u2019 or \u2018more certain\u2019 than the conclusion. Although\nstandardlywedoubtneitherothermindsnorexternalobjects,in\nany case where we were ready to put the latter in question, the\nformer would likely be in question as well.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 257 Similarly, the fact that we occasionally consider explanations\nforphenomenathatdidnotoccurcanalsobeunderstoodwithin\nthe context of the basic asymmetry. Such explanations are\naccounts of \u2018how it could be that X\u2019, based on the tentative\nsupposition that X is the case. How could it be that female\ncriminality would approach the level of male criminality in\nNorth America in the 1980s? This isn\u2019t the case, but we might\nsuppose that it is, and see what explanatory factors could be\noffered in that event \u2013 greater participation of women in the\nlabor force, greater responsibility of women for economic\ndependents, television shows featuring women in forceful and\nviolent roles, and so on. This kind of mental exercise could\nsometimesbeimportant.Itisunusual,butpossible,anddoesnot\nundermine the basic pragmatic asymmetry between argument\nand explanation.\n3a. Kant and Transcendental Arguments\nNor does the intermingling of explanation and argument in\ntranscendental arguments undercut this fundamental\ndistinction. In a transcendental argument, a conclusion C is\njustifiedonthegroundsthatitisanecessaryconditionforthetruth\nof some premises, K, which are taken as true. These premises\ndescribe human knowledge, conceptual structures, or belief\nsystems. The conclusion is deduced from the premises. The\nexplanatory element comes in by reversing the order. It is not\nthat \u2018K therefore C\u2019 is both an argument and an explanation.\nRather, \u2018K therefore C\u2019 is an argument, and \u2018C, thus K\u2019 is an\nexplanation, or partial explanation.\nKant, the locus classicus here, says that in such arguments a\nprinciple is justified because only given that principle is our\nknowledge possible. The word \u2018only\u2019 refers to the necessary\ncondition relationship on which the justification is based. The\nidea of making possible introduces explanation. In a\ntranscendental argument, one tries to justify a principle by\nshowingthatitstruthisanecessaryconditionofknowledgethat\n258TRUDYGOVIER we have; therefore, it is true. (Example: in Kant\u2019s account, we\nhave knowledge of geometry and only with an a priori intuition\nof space could we have that knowledge. Therefore there is an\na priori intuition of space.) But the principle that is justified as\na necessary condition is also supposed to explain the existence\nof that knowledge of which it is the condition. The principles\ndescribe a feature that helps make that knowledge possible. It is\nthus part of the explanation as to how we got that knowledge.\nThe knowledge is assumed both in the justification of the\nprincipleandintheaccompanyingexplanation.(Again,referring\nto Kant\u2019s account, we are able to have a priori knowledge in\ngeometrybecausespaceisaprioriandis\u2018inus\u2019.)Grantingthatwe\nhave the knowledge, we argue that the principle is true. Given\nthetruthoftheprinciple,weuseittoexplaintheexistenceofthe\nknowledge.19 Justification and explanation are both supposed\nto occur in transcendental arguments, and the compact phrase\n\u2018only given P is K possible\u2019 welds them together. It is crucial to\nnote here that what justifies is not the same as what explains. The\nexistence of transcendental arguments does not undercut the\ndistinctionbetweenargumentandexplanation.Rather,aproper\nunderstanding of those arguments presupposes this contrast.\n3b. Inference to the Best Explanation\nNordoestheexistenceofargumentsthatproceedbyinference\nto the best explanation blur the distinction between argument\nand explanation. Suppose that F is a fact, and that E is proposed\nas the best explanation for F. We may then argue from F to E, as:\n1. F\n2. E is the best explanation for F.\nTherefore, probably,\n3. E\nSuch a line of reasoning is an argument; in the argument we\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 259 try to justify (3). We argue in favour of a hypothesis or theory\n(E) on the grounds that it would serve as the best explanation\nof a fact or presumed fact (F). The argument is not at the same\ntime an explanation, nor could it be. What is explained, as the\nbasis for this argument, is F. F appears here as a premise. Those\nwho read arguments as explanations read the conclusion as the\nexplanandum. But here the conclusion would be the explanans.\nAs Nozick remarked, the inference to the best explanation\n(abductive) arguments presuppose the underlying pragmatic\nasymmetry between argument and explanation. Only because\nthe explanandum is, in this case, known prior to the explanans\nare we able to infer the latter from the former. In an argument,\nthe conclusion is not better known than the premises and we\n(certainly) do not infer the premises from the conclusion.\n4. Counterexamples\nThere remains Thomas\u2019 claim that some discourses constitute\nboth argument and explanation, on the same interpretation.20\nThomas offers several persuasive examples in defense of this\ncontroversial thesis. Here are some of his most persuasive cases.\nA. \u2018All natural disasters are comforting because they reaffirm our\nimpotence,inwhich,otherwise,wemightstopbelieving.Attimes\nit is strangely sedative to know the extent of your own\npowerlessness.\u2019 (From Erica Jong, Fear of Flying (New York:\nNew American Library, 1974), p. 204.\nB. \u2018Manyoftheproblemsofphilosophyareofsuchbroadrelevance\nto human concerns, and so complex in their ramifications that\nthey are, in one form or another, perennially present. Though\nin the course of time they yield in part to philosophical inquiry,\nthey may need to be rethought by each age in the light of its\nbroader scientific knowledge and deepened ethical and religious\nexperience. Better solutions are found by more refined and\nrigorous methods. Thus, one who approaches the study of\n260TRUDYGOVIER philosophy in the hope of understanding the best of what it\naffords will look for both fundamental issues and contemporary\nachievements.\u2018(From Elizabeth and Monroe Beardsley,\n\u2018Introduction to the Prentice Hall Foundations in\nPhilosophy Series\u2019.)\nC. \u2018Man hating is a defense, a refusal, and an affirmation.

The conclusion follows from\nthese; it is almost a summary of what has been said before.\nExample(C)reallycontainstwosetsofreasoning.Thereisfirst\nthereasoningtoshowthat\u2018manhatingisadefense,arefusal,and\nanaffirmation\u2019.Here,theformisessentially\u2018P;Q;R;thereforeP\nand Q and R\u2019. This part of the passage should clearly be taken as\nan argument. It has no plausibility whatever as an explanation.\nThe supporting statements are particular facts that are\nsummarized in the conclusion. The next part of the passage is\nharder to interpret: \u2018What is primary is the possibility for release\n262TRUDYGOVIER gainedfromacknowledgingits(thehatred\u2019s)existence,andtherenewal\nthat can sometimes accompany its expression. For if Isay today \u2018I hate\nyou\u2019, it is in order that tomorrow it might perhaps be easier to say, \u2018I\nlove you\u2018.\u2019 This passage is similar to the one from Fear of Flying\n(A). Its epistemic credentials are feeble, whether we regard it as\nexplanation,argument,neither,orboth.Wereitnotfortheword\n\u2018for\u2019atthebeginningofthesecondsentence,therewouldbelittle\nbasis for seeing it as reasoned at all. (In fact, what we see as\nreasoning,assuming\u2018for\u2019tomean\u2018because\u2019,issoweakthatthere\nmay be a charitable inclination to search for another function\nfor the word \u2018for\u2019 in this context. Perhaps it is serving merely\nas conjunction.) Given the presence of this word, the sentences\nmake equal sense as explanation or argument; the second may\nberegardedeitherastheexplanationforthefirst,itstruthbeing\ngranted, or as a reason (premise) for believing that the first is\ntrue. Given the controversial and rather surprising nature of\nthe first statement, the second interpretation is somewhat more\nplausible. If we adopt it, we might then also regard the premise\nas explanatory. The move is: P, for Q; that is, Q is a reason to\nbelieve that P. In addition, Q explains why P is true. As with\nexample (A), (C) tends to confirm Thomas\u2019 view, but is not an\nideal example, because it is so weak epistemically \u2013 whether\ninterpreted as argument, explanation, or both.\nThe last example cited, (D), seems best to illustrate Thomas\u2019\nclaim that the same passage can constitute both explanation and\nargument. The passage shows that cable television is still at a\nstage where there are choices to be exercised regarding its\ndevelopment. Four reasons are given for this claim: the history\nofgovernmentregulationinthefieldoftelevision;thepossibility\nof citizen action; the absence of significant vested interests; and\nthe relative novelty of cable television on the national scene.\nThese areconvergent reasons; all givesome independent evidence\nfor the claim. Such \u2018reasons\u2019, however, may also be regarded as\nexplanatory \u2018factors\u2019. Their existence explains why cable\ntelevision is still open to choice. The explanation has the same\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 263 structure as the argument. In fact, the argument provides the\nexplanation too. Interestingly, the structure is nothing like that\nsuggested by the deductive nomological model of explanation.\nWedonothaveuniversalorgenerallawsunderwhichtheevent\nis subsumed, but rather separate explanatory factors, cited as\nrelevantandasshowinghowthisfeatureofcabletelevisionmay\nbe understood.\nThese cases bear out one of Thomas\u2019 key claims. There are\npassages that are both argumentative and explanatory, on the\nsame interpretation. This situation can occur because the very\nstatementsthatprovidereasonsorevidencethatwouldshowthe\nconclusion true also provide an explanation as to why it should\nbe true. The premises can serve also asexplanans.\nHowever, such examples do not justify Thomas\u2019 further claim\nthatthesamelogicalcriteriasufficetoevaluateexplanationsand\narguments.Whatmakethepassageagoodorplausibleargument\nare not the same conditions that makes it a good or plausible\nexplanation, as numerous other examples have indicated. Both\nfor sound argument and for good explanation, we require valid\nor legitimate reasoning from some statements to others. But the\nasymmetry of explanation and argument means that the quite\ndifferent conditions must be met by justifying premises and\nexplaining statements. Because these conditions are not\nincompatible,theycanbemetsimultaneously.Whenthatoccurs,\nwe find both explanation and argument at once. Statements are\nable to justify, because in a context where the conclusion is in\ndoubt, they are better known. They are able to explain in virtue\nof other complex conditions, which entail their being able, in a\ncontext,tospecifyacause,underlyingstructure,orpurposethat\nshowshowandwhythephenomenadescribedintheconclusion-\nexplanandum came to be as they are.\nOnce a conclusion is accepted, we can look back to the\npremisesasofferinganexplanationastowhyitistrue.Thevery\nsame claims show both that the conclusion is true and why it is\ntrue. The same passage constitutes both argument (justification)\n264TRUDYGOVIER and explanation, just as Thomas maintained. This can happen\nbecause the justifying premises are also statements that are\nappropriate to explain the fact that is in the conclusion. The\naudience would, however, have to be convinced of the truth of\ntheconclusionbeforeanexplanationastowhyitwastruewould\nseem necessary.\n5.Philosophy, Pedagogy, and Argument-ExplanationAsymmetry\nAlthoughtheredoexistsomearguments thatareexplanations\nand some explanations that are arguments, the distinction\nbetween argument and explanation remains important, both\npragmatically and epistemically. One way of seeing this is to\nconsider how we differently approach a \u2018why\u2019 question,\ndependingonwhetherwetakeittobearequestforjustificatory\nargument or for explanation. Suppose that someone asks \u2018Why\ndid Jesse Jackson\u2019s 1984 trip to Cuba receive so little media\nattention?\u2019. If this is taken as a request for an explanation, it will\nbemetbystatementstryingtospecifycauses.(Perhapswhenthe\ntrip occurred, it did not strike media people as important, being\nregarded as solely propagandistic in intent; perhaps Jackson\u2019s\nactivities were regarded as interesting only insofar as they bore\non the 1984 presidential campaign in the United States; perhaps\nother major world events happened at the same time; perhaps\nmedia people were racist; and so on.) On the other hand, if the\nquestion is taken as a request for justification, a different kind\nof answer is called for. The questioner is then asking either for\nevidence that the trip was indeed given little attention, in effect\ndemanding empirical information about coverage in headlines,\ninches, location of article, and so on as compared to relevantly\nsimilar events; or she is asking for a moral/political justification\nfor giving the trip little space. Thus, what constitutes a proper\nresponse and an answer to the question will depend very much\nonwhetherwetake\u2018why\u2019asmakingarequestforanexplanation\nor an argument.\nThe significance of the distinction between argument and\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 265 explanation is again apparent when we consider elliptical\narguments and explanations. Suppose, for instance, that\nsomeone says he believes in God because he learned religion at\nhis mother\u2019s knee. If \u2018because\u2019 is used as explanatory here, we\nwould regard what is said as elliptical for something like the\nfollowing:\n1. I learned religion at my mother\u2019s knee.\nMissingExplanans:Peopleusuallypersistinbelievingthosethings\nthatthey learn at their mother\u2019s knee.\nThat is (the cause) why:\n2. I believe in God.\nOn the other hand, if we take the comments to express an\nargument we will probably regard that argument as elliptical\nas well. However, we will complete it in quite a different way,\nperhaps along such lines as:\n1. I learned religion at my mother\u2019s knee.\nMissingPremise:Mostofwhatpeoplelearnattheirmother\u2019sknee\nis true.\nTherefore, (probably)\n2. God exists.\nThe comments do a better job of providing a plausible\nexplanation than of providing a justifying argument.(The\nproposedmissingpremiseisalmostcertainlyfalse.)The\u2018why\u2019of\njustificationtypicallyasksnotforproofthatthebeliefisheld,but\nfor reasons purporting to show it true or acceptable.\nNoting how the inserted material differs in these cases and\nhow the conclusion of the argument differs from the statement\nof the explanandum, we can see that the argument/ explanation\ndistinction retains considerable epistemic and pragmatic\nsignificance. The force of \u2018why\u2019 questions and \u2018because\u2019 answers\nvaries, depending on whether we deal with a request for an\n266TRUDYGOVIER explanationorforajustification.Differentclaimsaredifferently\nrelevant, and different standards of success apply. To be sure,\nreasoning is used both in explanations and in arguments.\nWithoutthefullcontext,someresponsescouldbetakenaseither\none or the other. Nevertheless, the distinction retains its\npragmatic significance, and the pragmatics of the matter are\nrelated to our logical and epistemic appraisal of the result.\nMuch of what Thomas says is true and important. But the\nexistence of some interesting cases where argument and\nexplanation go on at once does not show that the distinction\nbetween justificatory argument and explanation is dispensable.\nThomas\u2019 challenge is useful in pointing out the need for greater\nattention to argument and explanation and in reminding us that\nreasoningplaysacrucialroleinboth.Hisexamplesshowthatthe\napplication of the distinction is not suitable as an early exercise\nfor students unless examples are carefully selected. Background\ninformation about context and audience may be required.\nTextbookaccountsofargumentandexplanationshouldbemade\nmore subtle and qualified, so as to allow that justification and\nexplanation are not mutually exclusive. There exist both cases\nwhere these go on together and cases that are borderline and\nhard to classify as one or the other. We can allow that reasoning\nis used both in explanation and argument and that the same\nindicatorwordsareusedineach,oftenwithcloselyparallelroles.\nWe may wish to allow, as Thomas suggests, that logicians who\nsee themselves as appraising reasoning would do well to include\nexplanation as well as argument within the scope of logic.\nBut given the pragmatic and epistemic differences that exist,\nthe fundamental contrast between explanation and argument\nretains its pedagogical importance. In a society where people so\noften tell you how they came to think as they do while ignoring\nissues of justification, to omit the distinction between argument\nand explanation from the pedagogy of critical thinking would\nbe a serious mistake. The \u2018psychoanalysis\u2019 of thought will\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 267 presuppose rational argument and critical thinking. It should\nnever replace them.\nNotes\n1. The phrase \u2018the fact explained\u2019 refers to the description of the\nfacts or events explained.\n2. Recent discussion still uses this Hempel-Oppenheimer\naccount as its starting point, though prevailing opinion is that\nthe covering law model is not adequate. For present purposes,\nmy main concern with the Hempelian account is with its\nclassification of explanation as one type of argument.

I discussed transcendental arguments and the role of\nexplanation within them in my doctoral dissertation, A Study\nof Transcendental Arguments (University of Waterloo, 1971; listed\nunder the name Gertrude R. Kelly.) Kant put it this way: \u2018I\nunderstand by a transcendental exposition the explanation of\na concept, as a principle from which the possibility of other a\npriori synthetic knowledge can be understood. For this purpose\nit is required (1) that such knowledge does really flow from the\ngiven concept, (2) that this knowledge is possible only on the\nassumption of a given mode of explaining the concept.\u2019 (Critique\nof Pure Reason,B41; Norman Kemp Smith translation.)\n8. As we will see later, this occurs when the same set of\nstatements satisfies both the conditions required in order to\nmake them justifying premises and the conditions required in\norder to make them explanatory. These conditions, though\ndistinct,arenotincompatible,andthusitmayhappenthatsome\nsets of statements satisfy both at once.

In the essay in his instructors\u2019 manual, Thomas claims that\nexamples throughout the text bear out his theory. He mentions\nthat exercise set 1-1B is especially revealing for these purposes.\nIndeed,bymycalculation,fully9of37exercisesinthatsetcould\nbe analyzed as both explanatory and justificatory. Examples\ndiscussed here come from this set of exercises.\n270TRUDYGOVIER CHAPTER 9.\nFOUR REASONS THERE ARE NO FALLACIES?\nA cavalier and confident formalist approach to fallacies is no longer\nstandard; the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy reports instead\nthatithasprovenmoreprofitabletoexplorefallacieswithoutappealing\nto formal languages. In other words, a nonformal approach to fallacies\nhas become standard over the years since this chapter was written.\nThus the notions queried in this chapter seem no longer to be in vogue\nand the criticisms of cavalier formalism with regard to fallacies are\nunnecessary, though not incorrect.\nKarl Lambert, William Ulrich, and Gerald Massey were all formal\ntheorists and developed their critical accounts of fallacies from that\nperspective. Lambert and Ulrich held that all that needed to be said\nabout poor arguments was that they were not formally valid; one did\nnot need \u2018fallacy\u2019 as an additional category. Massey held that to show\nthat a fallacy occurred, one would need to demonstrate that poor\narguments failed to be formally valid. But, given the asymmetry\nbetween valid and invalid arguments, it was not possible to formally\nprove invalidity. It was from a formalist standpoint, then, that these\nlogicians argued against the very notion of fallacy. I argued that their\naccounts are flawed; it is fair to say that that conclusion is accepted\ntoday.\nA 2017 search of Philosopher\u2019s Index revealed more than six\nhundredarticleswith\u201cfallacy\u201dor\u201cfallacies\u201dinthetitle.However,many\nof these works do not seem to be about fallacies as a general theme;\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 271 rather they treat a distinct topic (miracles, evolution, the mind/body\nproblem), alleging one or more mistakes (\u2018fallacies\u2019 in a broad sense)\nin the treatment of that topic. My casual survey revealed intriguing\nnames of fallacies I had never heard of \u2013 the neurological fallacy,\nthe moralistic fallacy, the unintentional fallacy, the reverse inference\nfallacy, and the great mind fallacy, to name just a few. Fallacies have\nnot gone out of fashion.\nIn his recent book The Undoing Project: A Friendship that\nChanged Our Minds, Michael Lewis describes the collaboration of\nAmos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. Working over many years first\nin Israel and then in North America,\nTversky and Kahneman described a number of characteristic errors\nin reasoning. Lewis reports that their work provoked considerable\ncriticism, much of it due to the fact that they were arguing that there\nwere types of reasoning errors that people commonly make. In other\nwords, people often reason incorrectly. That conclusion was\nenergetically resisted in some quarters. Reading Lewis\u2019s account, I was\nreminded of the charitable resistance to allegations of fallacies.\nSomehow, people do not like to see others accused of systematically\nflawed reasoning; they seek an interpretation according to which these\nmistakes are not happening. And they suspect the accusers of being in\nsome sense \u2018smart alecks\u2019 \u2013 pretending to know more about accurate\nthinking than the average person and to detect errors ordinary people\ncannot recognize for themselves. It remains a temptation. I submit that\nthe reasoning in this chapter, usefully supplemented by the evidence\nprovided by Philosopher\u2019s Index indicates that fallacies are not to\nbe vanquished by the technique of presuming that other people are\nbasically rational. I argue for a modest principle of charity and for\nattention to details of speech, text, and context. This approach to\ninterpretation will not eliminate fallacies; nor would I wish to do that.\nWhen this chapter was written in the nineteen eighties, principles of\ninterpretation were central to the problem of fallacies. Both for\nexplaining and identifying particular fallacies and for fallacy theory,\nthey remain so.\n272TRUDYGOVIER Reacting to the proliferation of texts and courses on informal\nfallacies,anumberofpeoplehaverecentlyvoicedconcernabout\nthe lack of rigor and consensus in the area. Some have gone so\nfar as to argue that there are no informal fallacies at all, that\nthereisnowaytoshowanyargumentinvalid,thatfallaciesexist\nonly in the pages of textbooks and the minds of logicians, or\nthat fallacies are products of uncharitable interpretation.1 Such\nrevisionist views raise important questions. But though\nprovocative, they are not correct \u2013 or so I shall argue here.\nBy definition, a fallacy is a mistake in reasoning, a mistake\nthat occurs with some frequency in real arguments and that\nis characteristically deceptive.2 This means, not that a person\nwhousesafallaciousargumentnecessarilyintendstodeceivehis\naudience but that the fallacious argument itself is deceptive, in\nthesensethatitstrikesmanypeopleascogent,thoughitisnot.3\nAn arguer may recognize his fallacious argument as fallacious\nand intend to deceive others with it, or he may think that it is a\ncogent argument and use it in all sincerity. Since a fallacy in the\nlogicalsenseinvolvesamistakeinreasoning,inordertocommit\none, a person must be reasoning. Colloquially, false beliefs are\noften termed fallacies, but traditional logical usage restricts the\nterm to reasoning errors, a usage followed here. In order to\ncommitafallacy,apersonmustreasonfromoneormoreclaims\ntoothers.Inthepresentcontext,thisistosaythatapersonwho\ncommits a fallacy must be arguing. Furthermore, not just any\nmistake in reasoning counts as a fallacy. A fallacy is a mistake\nthatisofakind:itisrepeatable,andrepeatedinothercontexts.4\nA mistake in reasoning which is idiosyncratic and unlikely to be\nrepeateddoesnotqualifyasafallacy,eventhoughitisamistake\nin reasoning.\nThere is, then, a tacit empirical claim in saying that an\nargument involves a fallacy. Indeed, some who are sceptical\naboutfallaciesbasetheirscepticismonempiricalconsiderations.\nTheyagreethatsuchmovesasposthocandadhominemwouldbe\nmistakesweretheyevertooccur,butbelievethatrealarguments\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 273 seldom or never include them. Saying that a fallacy is deceptive\nand that it is a mistake of a kind which occurs relatively often\ncommits the critic to empirical claims as well as logical ones. If\none invents a mistake in reasoning and invents an example in\nwhichitoccurs,onewillnottherebyhaveinventedordiscovered\nafallacy\u2013notunlessthatso-calledfallacyseemstomanypeople\nat first blush not to be one.\nFrom these considerations we can see that there are many\npotential problems about fallacies. To say that an argument\nexemplifies one or another fallacy commits a critic to an\ninterpretation of an arguer as reasoning in some specific way;\nto a logical judgment that the reasoning embodies a mistake;\nto a classification of that mistake as being one of a type; and,\nimplicitly, to the empirical claim that the mistake is of a type\nrepeatedelsewhereandisdeceptiveinthesensethatpeopletend\nnot to recognize it as a mistake.\nThese points are no doubt of considerable pedagogical\nsignificance. Identifying and diagnosing a fallacy is no simple\nmatter.Giventhecomplexitiesinvolved,andgiventheadditional\nproblem that actual arguments may, on different interpretations\nor even on the same one, illustrate several distinct fallacies at\nonce, there may be important reasons against teaching critical\nskills by beginning with fallacies. Combine these features with\nthe point that the counterfeit presumes the real, so that fallacies\npresuppose pertinent concepts of good argument, and it is easy\nto understand why many people object to teaching argument\nor critical thinking through fallacies analysis. However, while\nrecognizing the importance of these points, we need not grant\nwholesale revisionist claims about fallacies. From the fact that\nthe identification of fallacies is a complicated matter it does not\nfollow that there are no fallacies at all. Like the a priori\nelimination of evil, the a priori elimination of fallacies has a\ncertain charm and appeal, but the results depart from common\nsense.\n274TRUDYGOVIER 1.Formal Invalidity as the Whole Story\nIntheirtext,TheNatureofArgument,KarlLambertandWilliam\nUlrich express considerable scepticism about fallacies. Their\napproachistodisputeinformalfallaciesonly;theformalonesare\nto rest secure. Lambert and Ulrich begin by saying:\nOnlytwothingscangowrongwithanargument\u2013itcanbeinvalidorit\ncan be unsound. If an argument is invalid, then it has a counterexample;\nwhether or not it is also an instance of an \u2018informal fallacy\u2019 is beside the\npoint.5\nThis is clearly a deductivist account; the authors presume that\nconnections between premises and conclusion can be appraised\nin only one way: for deductive validity. The presumption is that\napremise/conclusionconnectionislegitimateiftheargumentis\nformally deductively valid and not otherwise. A more pluralistic\nview of argumentation would require a more complex analysis.\nWhenworkingthroughLambertandUlrich\u2019saccount,itisuseful\nto keep their presumption in mind. The difficulties that arise\nfromwithinthislimitedviewareaggravatedifamorepluralistic\ntheory of argument is adopted.\nLambert and Ulrich claim that formal invalidity and only\nformal invalidity constitutes a mistake in reasoning. If we can\nshow that an argument is formally invalid, then we know that\nit is not a cogent argument; on this account any further remark\nto the effect that it also exemplifies an informal fallacy will be\n\u2018beside the point\u2019. Lambert and Ulrich continue:\nEven when one learns to recognize alleged examples of the various\n\u2018fallacies\u2019,itisdifficulttoseewhatcommonfactormakesthemallinstances\nof the same fallacy\u2019.6\nIdentifyingthiscommonfactoriseasyinthecaseofarguments\nthat are formally invalid, because two arguments which\nexemplify the same mistake will have been formally represented\ninsuchawaythatwecanseethattheyhavethesameform.Inthe\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 275 caseofpurportedinformalfallacies,LambertandUlrichsay,this\nis not so easy.\nThe question raised is important because, as we have seen, a\nfallacyembodiesamistakeinreasoningwhichisofakind.Given\nthat two arguments both make mistakes in reasoning, when is\nit true that they make the same mistake? It would seem that\na formal approach will give a straightforward answer to this\nquestion.Aninformalornonformalapproachmaynot.Lambert\nandUlrichgoontoexplorethequestionwithreferencetooneof\nthe standard informal fallacies, thead hominem.\nIn the ad hominem someone uses a fact about a person\u2019s\ncharacter to discredit his claims or his argument. Lambert and\nUlrich put forward a case of this type:\n1. Mr. Jenner claims that evidence E is strong evidence that Mr.\nNixon is guilty of obstruction of justice.\n2. Mr. Jenner was a member of a commission that recommended the\nlegalization of prostitution.\nTherefore,\n3. E is not strong evidence that Mr. Nixon is guilty.7\nThere is an interpretive matter to note here. This model\nrepresents the conclusion held as a claim that the attacked\narguer\u2019s view is false. But often people use facts about character\nto allege that claims made are less credible than they might be\nwhenmadebyotherpeople,orthattheyshouldnotbeaccepted.\nThere are more modest conclusions and might plausibly be\ndefended by ad hominem allegations in inductive contexts.8 The\nmatter is significant because the issue of sensitive interpretation\nin fallacies analysis is one on which fallacies critics have\nfrequently been attacked.\nThepurportedadhominemargumenthasasimplelogicalform,\naccording to Lambert and Ulrich. It is of the form:\n276TRUDYGOVIER A\nB\nTherefore,\nnot-C\nLambertandUlricharesurethattheargumentisofthisform,\nand no other. Clearly this form is not that of a formally valid\nargument. Hence, Lambert and Ulrich conclude, the argument\nis not sound. It exemplifies a mistake in reasoning which is a\nformalmistake.Theauthorsmaintainthatthedescriptionofthe\nad hominem has no bearing on the identification and analysis of\nthis mistake.\nThe authors unhesitatingly presume that their particular way\nof formalizing the argument is correct. That is, their\nrepresentation captures all features of the argument that are\nrelevanttothedeductiveappraisaloftheconnectionbetweenits\npremises and its conclusion. This is a premature assumption, as\nweshallseewithavengeancewhenwecometoGeraldMassey\u2019s\naccount of proofs of invalidity. Compare the authors\u2019 sample\nargumentwiththefollowinginventedandtriviallittleargument:\n1. The table in the corner is brown.\n2. Everything which is brown is not green.\nTherefore,\n3. It is not the case that the table in the corner is green.\nThis argument is apparently also of the form \u2018A,B, therefore\nnot-C\u2019. Yet it is deductively valid in the straightforward sense\nthat if both premises are true, it is logically impossible for the\nconclusiontobefalse.UsingLambertandUlrich\u2019sapproach,we\ncould conclude that the above argument is invalid. Apparently\nit has the same logical form as the ad hominem argument which\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 277 they invented; they said that argument was invalid due to its\nform. What has gone wrong is that a proposed formalization\n\u2018A,B, therefore not-C\u2019 does not capture those features of the\nargument (meaning of colour words) that make it deductively\nvalid.\nLambert and Ulrich point out that there are many arguments\nthat have the form \u2018A, B, therefore not-C\u2019 and that do not\nconstitute ad hominem arguments. From this they infer that\nclassifying an argument as ad hominem is not useful: this\nclassification does not properly characterize the mistake in\nreasoning which is involved in it. However, all of this presumes\ntheadequacyofLambertandUlrich\u2019sformalanalysis.Sincethat\nanalysiscanbeusedtoclaimeventhatthevalidargumentabout\nthe brown table is invalid, there must be something wrong with\nthe account.\nThat an argument can be formally represented as having the\nform \u2018A, B, therefore not-C\u2019 will indicate that it contains\nincorrect reasoning only if that formal representation is an apt\nway of representing the argument. This point is absolutely\ncentral. A formalization is an apt way of representing the\nargument only if it represents all those features relevant to the\nlogical appraisal of the argument. An analysis along the \u2018A, B,\nnot-C\u2019lineshowsusnothingofimportanceabouttheargument.\nTo complete their account of the example, Lambert and Ulrich\nwould have to show that their formalization is the only\nappropriateone;thatthisisaway,andtheonlyway,ofcapturing\nthe kind of reasoning used in the argument. They did not\nappreciate the need to accomplish this task, and it is, to say the\nleast, unlikely that they could complete it.\nWe may show that an argument cannot be proved valid\naccording to one formal representation and using one formal\nsystem, but the question remains whether there is another\nrepresentation and/or another system which would give a\ndifferent result. These problems arise even within the narrow\nformalist and deductivist framework that Lambert and Ulrich\n278TRUDYGOVIER employ.9 It is not so easy as Lambert and Ulrich suppose to\nshow that an argument is formally invalid. Problems would be\naggravatedconsiderablywerewetobroadenournotionofwhat\nis relevant to the workings of arguments so as to include the\npossibility of cogent nondeductive arguments and of nonformal\nterms as playing a key role.\nLambert and Ulrich have not provided a knockdown formal\nrefutation of the argument they put forward as an example of\nad hominem. Their account presupposes a narrow theory of\nargument and, even within the bounds of that narrow theory,\nraises as many questions as it answers. The authors suppose\nthat their analysis is uncontroversially correct and go on to ask\nwhat an informal fallacies analysis might add to the supposedly\nwatertightaccount.Theycomparetheirfirstinventedargument\nto another.\n1. Jones maintains that socialism is wrong.\n2. Jones is a rich stockbroker.\nTherefore,\n3. It is not the case that socialism is wrong.\nAnd they comment:Someone who gave this argument would\nprobablybetryingtopersuadeusthatsocialismisnotwrongbygetting\nus to distrust or dislike Jones. This argument has the same logical form.\nA\nB\nTherefore\nnot-C\nSo it is indeed invalid \u2026 but this does nothing to characterize the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 279 informal fallacy of argumentum ad hominem because these two\narguments also share the same form with:\n1. The sky is blue.\n2. Grass is green.\nTherefore,\n3. It is not the case that tigers are carnivorous.\nThis argument, although it is an instance of the same formal fallacy, has\nnothingtodowithattemptingtodiscreditaperson\u2019sviewsbydiscrediting\nhis character. Thus, if there is a fallacy of argumentum ad hominem,\nthere must be a way of characterizing it according to which the first two\nargumentsaboveareinstancesbutthethirdisnot.Itis,however,difficult\ntoseethatthesetwoargumentshaveanythingincommonotherthantheir\nlogical form, and the fact that those who offered them had certain base\nmotives,namely,todiscreditsomeone\u2019sviewsbydiscreditinghischaracter.\n10\nAnd yet it is allowed, in the last sentence quoted, that the\ntwo prospective ad hominem arguments do have something in\ncommon. They share the feature that in both there is an attempt\nto discredit someone\u2019s views by discrediting his character. Now\ninterestingly, this is precisely the feature that informal logicians\nselect for attention when criticizing ad hominem arguments as\nfallacious. Lambert and Ulrich refer to it as a \u2018common motive\u2019\nbehind the arguments. This description makes it appear as\nthough what the two arguments have in common apart from\ntheir (alleged) common form \u2018A; B; therefore not-C\u2019 is a\npsychological matter. The arguers who would use such\narguments would share a motive.\nBut such terminology is tendentious and misleading. The\nfeature has to do with the content of the arguments. In both, the\npremises specify a fact about a person, a fact commonly thought\nto be deleterious, and in both the conclusion is that some view\nheld by the person is false. The arguments have in common that\n280TRUDYGOVIER in both premises about the (deleterious) character of people are\nused to support a conclusion to the effect that an opinion held\nby those people is incorrect. This matter of content has nothing\nto do with the motives of the people who would put forward\nsuch an argument, which could be anything at all. The common\nfeatureisoneofcontent;thatisstraightforwardlyapparent.The\nmatter of motive is one of speculation.\nLambert and Ulrich claim that this common feature (allegedly\nmotive) cannot serve to characterize any mistake in reasoning\nthatbothargumentsinvolve,because\u2018someattemptstodiscredit\na person\u2019s views by discrediting his character involve valid\nargument\u2019. They promptly invent one such, which has as two of\nits premises the following statements:\nIfJones isarich stockbroker and he maintains that socialism iswrong,\nthen he is lying. If Jones is lying, then socialism is wrong.11\nA deductively valid argument can be ad hominem, if an ad\nhominem argument is any argument in which the falsity of\nsomeone\u2019s view is inferred from considerations which include\nreference to disreputable aspects of his character. For Lambert\nand Ulrich this consequence amounts to a reductio of the idea\nthat the ad hominem description could be of any use in the\nappraisal of reasoning. For them, deductive validity and\ninvalidity are the whole story about reasoning from premises to\na conclusion. On this view, it would be absurd for an argument\nthat had the paradigm virtue of deductive validity to have\nanything wrong with it.\nThat the description offered for ad hominem arguments could\napply to a deductively valid argument is interesting, seldom\nnoticed, and perhaps important. However, in some sense this\nis not a surprising result. The two purported ad hominems had\nsomething in common. The common element was not a matter\nof formal structure as that is conventionally identified; it was\none of content. For the same content, a variety of structures are\npossible. For any argument which is based on an illegitimate\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 281 connectionbetweenXandY,onecanalsoproduceadeductively\nvalidargumentbyaddingapremisetotheeffectthatXandYare\nconnected in just the way the argument would require. That is\nthe strategy of inserting the associated conditional as a missing\npremise. The amended argument does in a sense make the same\npoint as the original one: the feature of deriving falsehood or\nlackofcredibilityofbelieffromaspectsofcharacterispreserved.\nYet the amended argument is deductively valid and hence not\nfallacious.\nBut what does this strategy prove? Lambert and Ulrich,\npresuming the definitive correctness of their formal analysis,\ninfer that neither the ad hominem classification nor any other\nclassification frominformallogiccanshowanythingaboutsuch\narguments. However,thatfactisopentoanotherinterpretation.\nThat ad hominem arguments can be made into deductively valid\nonesbyinsertingtheassociatedconditionalasamissingpremise\nshows that assessing arguments solely for formal deductive\nvalidity may show us precious little about their merits. Lambert\nand Ulrich do not establish their point concerning the examples\nthey discuss. They do not succeed in demonstrating their\nstrongly negative position about informal fallacies.\nWhat has been discussed is the part of Lambert and Ulrich\u2019s\ntreatment where \u2018they say it\u2019. There is also another part where\nthey \u2018take it back\u2019, with qualifying remarks like the following\nrather confusing statement:\nThere may be errors in reasoning that have nothing to do with the\nargumentsrepresentingthereasoning,eventhoughofcourseanylogically\ninvalid argument will correspond to some error in reasoning.12\nAnd:\nNo such argument (as begging the question) is fallacious, but anyone\nwhoarguedinthiswaywouldbemakingsomekindofmistake.Weare\nnotsuggestingthatthereisnovalueininvestigatingthevarioussortsof\nmistakes in reasoning that people are prone to make; on the contrary,\nthis is an area where interesting and fruitful discoveries are waiting to\n282TRUDYGOVIER bemade.Rather,wearesuggestingthatuntilageneralcharacterization\nof informal fallacies can be given which enables one to tell with respect\ntoanyargumentwhetherornotitexhibitsoneoftheinformalfallacies,\nknowing how to label certain paradigm cases of this or that mistake in\nreasoningisnotreallyusefulfordeterminingwhetheragivenargument\nis acceptable.13\nThesearepuzzlingqualifications,apparentlyinconsistentwith\nthe tenor of the main account. But given the fundamentally\nflawed nature of that account, such qualifications do not merit\nfurther attention here.\n2.Formal Invalidity as No Story\nIn several provocative articles, Gerald Massey has argued that\nit is not possible to prove an argument invalid. In 1975, in \u2018Are\nThere any Good Arguments that Bad Arguments are Bad?\u2019,\nMassey defended an asymmetrical account about proofs of\nvalidityandinvalidity.14Givenanargumentinnaturallanguage,\nifweparaphraseitcorrectlyintothesymbolsofacorrectformal\nsystem, and show it to be valid according to the rules of that\nsystem, we know that the argument is valid. Thus, formal logic\ncan be used to demonstrate the formal validity of arguments\ncouched in natural languages. But for demonstrations of\ninvalidity, Massey maintained, matters are not so simple.\nSuppose that we paraphrase an argument into the symbols of a\ncorrect logical system and find that it turns out to be an invalid\nargument in that system. Have we shown that the argument\nis invalid? We have not, because we do not know that there\nis no other system such that it would turn out to be valid in\nthat one. The question of whether the paraphrase is the only\nlogically revealing one remains open, as does the question of\nthe possibility of a correct logical system in which a logically\nrevealingparaphraseoftheargumentwouldturnouttobevalid.\nThe reason for the marked asymmetry between showing validity and\nshowinginvalidityshouldnowbeapparent.Toshowthatanargument\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 283 isvalid itsuffices toparaphrase itinto ademonstrably valid argument\nform of some (extant) logical system; to show that an argument is\ninvaliditisnecessarytoshowthatitcannotbeparaphrasedintoavalid\nargument form of any logical system, actual or possible.15\nMassey\u2019saccountwaswelcomedbysomeinformallogicianswho\nthoughtthistooktheformalistsdownapegortwo.Theaccount\ncouldbeinterpretedasshowingthatformalanalysispresupposes\nnonformal judgment as to the appropriacy of a paraphrase and\nthe aptness of the logical system to which the argument is\nreferred. (For informalists, this will be the right moral to derive\nfromthe story.Ilater argue forthis view.)Wemight see Massey\nas an ally, witting or unwitting, of those who advocate a\nnonformalapproachtotheanalysisofarguments.Heallowedin\nhispaperthatwecanshowargumentsinvalidinalogicallytrivial\nway by showing that the premises are true and the conclusion\nfalse and also, in subsequent discussion, that we may often have\nreasons for, or intuitions regarding, the inadequacy of\narguments. However, Massey remains adamant that such \u2018low\nlevel\u2019 nonformal judgments do not amount to a theory of\ninvalidity and that judgments of invalidity remain unfounded,\ntheoretically.16 Massey would require formal grounding for\ntheoretical security.\nJudgments of invalidity might come to be properly grounded,\nwere a logical grammar of a special kind to be found. In such\na case, we would have assurance that some paraphrase of an\nargument was the correct one, and that the rules according to\nwhichthatparaphrasecameoutasinvalidweretherightrulesto\napply.\n\u2026 the egregious asymmetry between proving validity and proving\ninvalidity will persist until one or more programmes, such as Natural\nLogic, have been successfully implemented.17\nAny alliance between informal logicians and Massey is\npremature and would not be to his taste. For him a theory is a\n284TRUDYGOVIER formal theory, and a judgment without a theory is only a slight\nimprovement on no judgment at all.\nAninformallogicianwhosoughtconsolationinMassey\u2019s1975\npaper would be disappointed by his 1981 article, \u2018The Fallacy\nbehindFallacies\u2019.18InthatpaperMasseycriticizesbothinformal\nand formal logicians for their attempts to teach students to find\nfallacies. He explicitly links his view to his earlier account of\nvalidity and invalidity.19\nIn his informative treatise on fallacy, Hamblin succinctly\ndescribes a fallacious argument as an argument that seems valid\nwithout being so. It is with fallacies so defined that I will\nhereafter be concerned.\nNotefirstthatfallaciousargumentsareinvalid.Henceatheory\noffallacypresupposesatheoryofinvalidity.Thereinliestherub.\nBut, as I claimed above and have argued for elsewhere, a theory\nof invalidity has yet to be developed. It is not surprising, then,\nthat treatments of fallacy eschew theory. There is no theory on\nwhich they could be based.\nEssentially, Massey employs the following argument:\n1. Whatever else fallacies are, they are invalid arguments.\nSo,\n2. To show that an argument is a fallacy, we must first show\nthat it is invalid.\nAnd,\n3. There is no formally adequate method of showing that an\nargument is invalid.\nSo,\n4. We cannot in any theoretically adequate way show that an\nargument is invalid.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 285 Therefore,\n5. There is no adequate theory underlying fallacies.\nFallacy analysis is sloppy and in a theoretical mess, because it\npresupposes well-founded judgments of formal invalidity and\nthese cannot be made.\n\u2026 whereas logical theory underwrites validity verdicts, the case for\ninvalidity verdicts (where the trivial logic- indifferent method is\ninapplicable) rests at bottom on intuitive judgments of invalidity\naltogether unsupported by theory.20\nLet us examine Massey\u2019s argument. The first premise, linking\nfallaciousness and invalidity, would strike many people as\nobvious. However, it poses problems. First, invalidity is not a\nnecessary condition of fallaciousness, provided that begging the\nquestion is a fallacy.21 Many arguments that beg the question\nare formally valid, and in some what explains their begging the\nquestion is the very same thing that makes them formally valid:\nthey contain a premise which is logically equivalent to the\nconclusion. Unless Massey has an unorthodox view about\nbegging the question, this phenomenon poses a problem for his\naccount. We cannot begin our account of fallacies by assuming\nthat all fallacious arguments are invalid unless we are prepared\nto rule out question begging as a fallacy from the very start.\nTheproblemcanbeextendedtootherfallacieswithadialectical\ncomponent, such as straw man. A sample argument such as:\n1. Indeterministsholdthathumanactionsareentirelyrandom.\n2. Entirely random actions are not responsible actions.\n3. Indeterminists hold that humans are responsible for their\nactions.\nSo,\n286TRUDYGOVIER 4. Indeterminists hold an inconsistent position regarding\nhuman action.\nTherefore,\n5. Indeterminists hold a false view.\ncan no doubt be represented as a deductively valid argument.\nWithsomemanipulation,itcanberepresentedasformallyvalid.\nNevertheless, due to the content of the first premise, the\nargument may commit the straw man fallacy. The question as\nto whether it does concerns the accuracy of that premise as\nan account of the indeterminist position. Given that a straw\nman argument might be cast as a deductively valid argument,\nand given that straw man has long been thought to be a fallacy,\nwe have another reason for questioning whether invalidity is\na necessary condition of fallaciousness.22 Some traditional\nfallaciescanappearevenindeductivelyvalidarguments,because\ntheyhavetodowithgeneralfeaturespertainingtocontent(aswe\nsaw with ad hominem, above) or because of dialectical aspects, as\nwith the straw man case. These are not formal features.\nNorisitclearthatinvalidityissufficientforfallaciousness. By\nallbutthemostadamantdeductivists,itisallowedthatthereare\nsomecogentargumentsthatarenotdeductivelyvalid.Ifthereis\nevenonecogentinductiveargument,thenthatisanon-fallacious\nargument which is not deductively valid. Hence, deductive\ninvalidity is not a sufficient condition for fallaciousness. In fact,\nfor different reasons, neither Hamblin nor Massey presume that\ninvaliditywouldbesufficientforfallaciousness. Invalidityinthe\ndeductive sense is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nfallaciousness.\nTheterms\u2018valid\u2019and\u2018invalid\u2019areusedinanumberofdifferent\nsenses even by logicians. The following three are pertinent here:\n1. Anargument isvalidifitspremises areproperlyconnected\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 287 to its conclusion and provide adequate reasons for it. It is\ninvalid otherwise. (Umbrella validity)\n2. An argument is valid if its premises deductively entail its\nconclusion, such that given the truth of those premises the\nfalsityoftheconclusionisalogicalimpossibility.Itisinvalid\notherwise. (Semantic validity)\n3. An argument is valid if its conclusion is formally derivable\nfromitspremisesusingtherulesofacorrectlogicalsystem.\nIt is invalid otherwise. (Formal validity)\nOn any theory of argument other than deductivism, it is only\numbrella validity that is of general relevance for argument\nappraisal. Given a pluralistic theory, the fact that an argument\nis semantically or formally invalid is, by itself, quite insufficient\nto establish the claim that the argument is fallacious23. An\ninductivelystrongargumentissemanticallyandformallyinvalid,\nbut that does not show that it is fallacious.\nLooking back at Massey\u2019s own central argument, we can see\nthat premise (1) does not hold; Premise (2) gets its support from\n(1) and is therefore unsupported; premise (3) is what Massey\nargues for in his 1975 paper. There is no formally adequate way\nof showing an argument to be formally invalid, because given\nits invalidity according to some system, the possibility remains\nopen of its turning out to be formally valid according to some\nothersystem.Thispointmaybegrantedifby\u2018formallyadequate\nmethod\u2019 we mean \u2018method that is formal and that does not\npresuppose any significant preformal judgments\u2019. If we grant\npremise (2) for the sake of argument and grant premise (3) as\nunderstood, there is still a gap in the inference from (2) and (3)\nto (4). The problem is in moving from not having a formally\nadequate method to not having any theoretically adequate\nmethod. This move reveals Massey\u2019s formalist predilections.\nAnyone who thinks that respectable nonformal theories are\n288TRUDYGOVIER possible will not accept this move and will not move to the final\nconclusion either.\nMassey\u2019s work is extremely important. It reveals the\nconsequences of taking an entirely formalist account of validity\nandargumentappraisaltoitslimits.ManyshareMassey\u2019sbeliefs\nabouttherelationshipbetweenfallaciousnessandinvalidityand\nmanyendorse his formalist account of validity and the idea that\nany theory worth its salt is a formal one. For such people,\nMassey\u2019s work leaves an important and profound problem.\nFrom the perspective of a pluralistic theory of argument and\na nonformalist concept of theoretical adequacy, Massey\u2019s\nargument against the fallacies is far from conclusive. His point\nabout invalidity is important and telling against the sort of\ninsensitive formalization Lambert and Ulrich used. It shows the\nneed to detect the linkage which is supposed to be there, to\ndistinguish between those features of the argument which are\nrelevanttoitslogicalappraisalandthosewhicharenot.Weneed\naparaphrasewhichcapturesallofthelogicallyrelevantfeatures.\nThe formal invalidity of a particular paraphrase shows nothing\nunless we are sure that paraphrase has captured the logically\nsignificant features of the original argument. Judgment on this\nmatter is not formal.\nMassey is unwilling to assume that ordinary human beings,\nordinary philosophers, or even ordinary logicians have a\npreformal capacity to make these judgments about what is and\nwhat is not relevant to the deductive appraisal of an argument.\nHe appears to use \u2018valid\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 solely in a formal sense, to\nsuch a degree that he makes such comments as:\n\u2026 consider arguments (7) and (8).\n(7)John took a walk by the river.\nJohn took a walk.\n(8)Tom, Dick and Harry are partners.\nTom and Harry are partners.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 289 Davidsondeservescreditforshowinghowtotranslate(7)intostandard\npredicate logic in such a way as to get a valid argument form.\n(Davidson\u2019s translation turns on quantification over events, something\nthat some philosophers find objectionable, but that is another matter.)\nAnteDavidson,nooneseemedabletosupplysuchatranslation,andso\nargument (7) was deemed invalid.24\nThispassageillustratesMassey\u2019stendencytoconflatesemantic\nand formal validity and to attribute this conflation to other\nlogicians and philosophers. Before Davidson\u2019s logical\ndiscoveries, arguments (7) and (8) were semantically valid but\nwere (perhaps) not known to be formally valid.\nMassey\u2019s problem arises only within a strictly formalist\nframework. If we are willing to grant that people understand\nargumentsandarecapableofappreciatinghowthesearguments\nwork so as to be able to construct correct formal paraphrases of\nthem, the problem does not arise. Granting that we understand\nan argument and see what sort of connection that argument\ndepends on, we can sometimes show an invalid argument to\nbe invalid by paraphrasing it into the terms of an appropriate\nformal system and employing the standards of that system.25 If\nwe are not willing to grant that people sometimes understand\narguments well enough to do this, Massey\u2019s point will hold. But\nthen, on such a view, many other problems arise as well.\nRolf George takes this approach in a postscript to a recent\npaper. He reminds his readers that, in addition to having the\ncapacity to understand sentences, people have the capacity to\nunderstand arguments.\nConsider, for instance, John 8:47, where Jesus argues\nHe that is of GodhearethGod\u2019s words: ye therefore hear them not,\nbecause ye are not of God.\nMight we be wrong about the form of this argument? Is it really\nconceivable that there is a clever translation into an extant formal\n290TRUDYGOVIER language that shows it to be valid, or a hitherto undreamt of formal\nlanguagethatwouldyieldavalidargumentform?Perhapssuchaformal\nlanguage will be revealed to us in the fullness of time, but assuredly, it\nwillsurpassallunderstanding.Forpresentpurposeswecanbeconfident\nthatwecanproperlydiscernthe(unique)formofthatargumentandfind\nit to be \u2018denying the antecedent\u2019.26\nThe passage strikes me as more subtle than George admits.\nParaphrasing, we arrive at \u2018if you are of God, you hear God\u2019s\nwords; you are not of God; therefore you do not hear God\u2019s\nwords. \u2018 The paraphrase uses, crucially, the placement of\n\u2018therefore\u2019 to identify the conclusion \u2018you do not hear God\u2019s\nwords\u2019. With this paraphrase, we can see that the argument is\nan example of the formally fallacious move of denying the\nantecedent.ItisthiscorrectparaphrasethatGeorge\u2019scomments\npresume. (An incorrect paraphrase would lead one to find a\ndifferent argument with the conclusion, \u2018you are not of God, \u2018\nand that argument would be a validmodustollens.)\nFormal proofs of invalidity are sometimes possible, given the\ncorrectnessofnecessarypreformalassumptions,However,these\nare neither necessary nor sufficient to ground a theory of\nfallacies, They are surely relevant to parts of such a theory; if\navailable, they offer part of the story of fallaciousness for some\ndeductive arguments, because dialectical considerations are\noften relevant to fallaciousness (as in begging the question and\nstraw man) and because only common and deceptive reasoning\nerrors will count as fallacies, they offer only part of the story,\neven for these cases,\n3.The Argument From Sloppiness\nWithonlyoccasionalexceptions,fallacieshavebeenthesubject\nmore of textbooks than of treatises. Textbook treatments of\nfallacies are often poor.27 Arguments are cited briefly and\ncarelessly interpreted; little is said to justify an interpretation\nor an allegation of error; points made in explaining one \u2018fallacy\u2019\nmay be contradicted in another part of a text where a different\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 291 \u2018fallacy\u2019 is being discussed; different texts may define differently\nwhat is called the same fallacy. Such problems are regrettable.\nFrom them, some have inferred that fallacies would make an\nimportant subject of study; others have concluded that there is\nnothing to the subject.28 Before introducing his argument about\ninvalidity in \u2018The Fallacy Behind Fallacies\u2019, Massey began to\nargue in this way. He said:\nThe myriad and intricate schemes for classifying fallacies suggest that\nthere is little theory behind the science of fallacy. This suggestion\nmisleadsonlybyimplyingthatthereisanytheoryatallbehindit.The\nunvarnishedtruthisthis:thereisnotheoryoffallacywhatsoever.Iwill\nreturn to this claim shortly.29\nA more extended version of this theme is found in Maurice\nFinocchiaro\u2019s recent paper, \u2018Fallacies and the Evaluation of\nReasoning\u2019.30\nFinocchiaro begins by saying that, for the appraisal of\narguments in natural language and extra-formal contexts, the\nformal approach faces a difficulty,\nstemming from the well-known fact that formal validity is neither a\nsufficient nor a necessary condition for the favorable evaluation of\nan argument. It is not sufficient because it excludes neither question-\nbegging arguments nor self-contradictory ones (i.e. arguments with\ninconsistent premises). It is not necessary partly because of the\nToulmin-type objection that most good arguments most of the time (in\ntheempiricalsciences,legalcontexts,humanities,andeverydaylife)are\nnotformallyvalid,andpartlybecauseformalvaliditypresupposesfully\nreconstructed arguments which in human reasoning are the exception\nrather than the rule.31\nUnlike Lambert, Ulrich, and Massey, Finocchiaro is not\nworking within a formalist frame of reference nor even within\na deductivist frame of reference. He endorses a version of the\nSpectrum Theory. A fallacies approach is, in principle, more\ncompatible with such theory than a purely formal approach.\nHowever, Finocchiaro notes, there are defects in many, if not\n292TRUDYGOVIER all, textbook accounts of fallacies. Finocchiaro\u2019s first complaint\nabout standard textbook treatments of fallacies is that there are\ntoofewrealexamples.(HeseesthesedefectsintextsbySalmon,\nKreyche, Cohen and Nagel, Fearnside, Holther, and Beardsley.)\nHe also states that the few real examples used are poorly\ninterpreted.Grantingthesepointsforthemoment,thequestion\nremains open as to what we wish to infer from them.\nFinocchiaro draws a sweeping conclusion:\nTheconclusionIwishtodrawfromsuch\u2018consultations\u2019isnotthaterrors\nin reasoning are probably not common in real life, but that there are\nprobably no common errors in reasoning. That is, logically incorrect\narguments may be common, but common types of logically incorrect\narguments probably are not.\nThe problem I wish to raise here is, do people actually commit fallacies\nasusuallyunderstood?Thatis,dofallaciesexistinpractice?Ordothey\nexistinthemindoftheinterpreterwhoisclaimingthatafallacyisbeing\ncommitted?32\nThe inadequacy of textbook treatments leads Finocchiaro to\nconcludethatthereareprobablynorealfallaciesinpractice;that\nfallaciesexistonlyinthemindsoflogicians.Thislineofthought\nmay be termed the argument from sloppiness.\nThe argument from sloppiness is hasty, to put it mildly. If\nexamples of fallacies are contrived, unrealistic, or in other ways\ninadequate, that is regrettable to be sure. One should point this\nout and refrain from using such texts, even if by using them\nonecanswellstudentenrollments.Butthesedeficiencies donot\nmakeitlikelythatnotextsonfallaciesareadequate,thatnotext\non fallacies ever could be adequate, that there are no fallacies in\nreal life, or that fallacies exist only in minds of logicians.\nFinocchiaro of course did not sample all texts. Notably he\nomitted several in which the authors are primarily interested in\nfallacies and try to offer many real examples such as Howard\nKahane\u2019sLogicandContemporaryRhetoricandRalphJohnsonand\nAnthonyBlair\u2019sLogicalSelf-Defense.Heincludedothersinwhich\nthe authors are primarily interested in deductive logic and\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 293 included a short section on fallacies merely as a gesture in the\ndirection of practicality or completeness.\nEven if all extant texts on logic and argument were to contain\nsloppily done sections on fallacies, this deplorable inadequacy\nwould not make it very likely that \u2018there are no common types\nof logically incorrect argument\u2019. Trivially, straw man would be a\ncommontypeoflogicallyincorrectargumentwerethistobethe\ncase. Also, a plausible explanation of such textbook inadequacy\nwould be that philosophers are poor empiricists who tend to\nbe lazy about collecting examples from colloquial or non\nphilosophical sources and who use each other\u2019s examples or\ninvent cases, rather than doing empirical work. There is ample\nevidence from other areas of philosophy to support this\nalternative explanation. Finocchiaro\u2019s statement that textbook\naccounts of fallacies should include a discussion of real\nexamples, sensitively interpreted, can scarcely be disputed.\nHowever, his inferences from the supposed inadequacies of\nseveral texts in this regard are shaky indeed.\nFinocchiaro\u2019s next criticism of the fallacies approach to\nargument appraisal is that texts are usually hasty in their\nprovision of grounds for deeming the \u2018disputed practice\u2019\nfallacious. He bases this charge on his own theory of the\ncorrectness of arguments.33It goes as follows:\nif a fallacy is defined as a type of common but logically incorrect\nargument, the various types would have to be the following: (1)\narguments claiming to be deductively valid but which are actually\ninvalid; (2) arguments claiming to be inductively strong but which are\nactually inductively weak; (3) arguments claiming to have some\ninductive strength but which have none. There is no way for an\nargument to be a fallacy without falling into one of the three above-\nmentioned classes.\nThis theory of argument is put forward briefly and given no\ndefense. The account does not accommodate question-begging\narguments. Nor does Finocchiaro define the contested term\n294TRUDYGOVIER \u2018inductive\u2019. On this theory of argument, criticism will almost\ncertainly be a precarious business, because so much depends\non whether an argument \u2018claims\u2019 deductive validity, inductive\nstrength, or merely some strength in a broadly inductive sense.\nNatural language has no reliable devices for indicating whether\nsuch connections are intended, and many arguers lack the\nrequisite philosophers\u2019 concepts. Which of Finocchiaro\u2019s levels\nof appraisal is appropriate in a given case will often be unclear.\nThis point is worth noting, for Finocchiaro tends to use the\ninterpretive problems which arise from his particular theory of\nargument as general problems for understanding the fallacies.\nWhen we interpret an arguer as having committed the formal\nfallacy of affirming the consequent, we must interpret him as\nreasoningfromtheassertionofaconditionalanditsconsequent\nto its antecedent. We must regard him as \u2018implicitly claiming\u2019\nthattheantecedentfollowsdeductivelyfromtheassertionofthe\nconditional and the consequent. In many contexts in which we\nmightmakesuchanallegation,alternativeinterpretationswillbe\npossible. For instance, we might regard the person as reasoning\nto the best explanation, as in \u2018Q; the fact that P would explain\nthe fact that Q (worded as \u2018if P then Q\u2019); therefore (no other\nexplanation of Q being possible) we may presume that P.\u2019\nContrarytohisownprioradmonitions,Finocchiarooffersno\nexampletoillustratethissuggestion.Butinprincipleitiseasyto\nseethatthisdifferent,non-deductiveinterpretationwouldoften\nbe possible. If someone says:\nI think there\u2019s going to be a fall election, because if there\u2019s a fall\nelection, there\u2019s a lot of government propaganda in the spring and,\nyou know, this spring, there has been quite a lot of government\npropaganda.\neither the affirming-the-consequent account or the inference-\nto-an-explanation account would be possible. We can represent\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 295 this line of thinking as \u2018G, because if G then L, and L\u2019, and take\nit as a deductive argument \u2013 one intended by the arguer as\ndeductively valid. We then find the fallacy of affirming the\nconsequent. Alternately, given the occurrence of \u2018I think\u2019 and\nthe fact that the imminence of an election could in fact explain\nprior government propaganda, it would be plausible, and more\ncharitable, to read the comments as constituting a non-\ndeductive argument in which an inference is made from a fact\nto a hypothesis which would explain that fact. On this\ninterpretation, there does not seem to be a fallacy. It is clear\nthat the alternative line of interpretation which Finocchiaro\nproposes would be plausible some of the time. But he owes us\na real example. Furthermore, the fact that this alternative,\neliminating charges of affirming the consequent as presuming\nuncharitableinterpretation,issometimesplausible,doesnotshow\nthat it isalwaysplausible.\nFinocchiaro goes on to contend that \u2018post hoc ergo propter hoc\u2019\nallegations are also based on sloppy and insensitive\ninterpretation. Both Salmon and Copi describe post hoc as a\nmistake in which one infers from the bare fact that B followed\nA, the conclusion that A caused B. Finocchiaro says of their\naccounts:\nNojustificationisgivenwhytheseinterpretationsarepreferabletothe\nfollowing:\u2018concludingthatBwascausedbyApartlybecauseBfollowed\nA\u2019,or\u2018theinferencethatoneeventisthecauseofanotherfromthefact,\namongothers,thatthefirstoccursearlierthanthesecond\u2019.Theselatter\ninterpretationsshouldbepreferredbecausetheyaremoreaccurateinthe\nsensethattheycorrespondmorecloselytoatypeofreasoninginwhich\npeople actually engage.34\nAgain, Finocchiaro supplies no examples. He says that his\ninterpretation would correspond more closely to reasoning that\npeopleactuallyuse,buthedoesnotbackupthisstatementeither\nwith empirical evidence or with a priori reasoning of the type\nsome philosophers have used in support of principles of charity.\n296TRUDYGOVIER He does not offer criteria to indicate which missing premises\nwe might add to supplement the stated claims which, as stated,\nareopentoaninterpretationaccordingtowhichtheyconstitute\na fallacious argument. Whether or not people often engage in\npost hoc reasoning is not something one is entitled to stipulate\nfrom a philosophical armchair. Finocchiaro suggests that those\nwhoidentifyposthocasafallacymakethemistakeofinterpreting\nwhat is offered as a \u2018weak\u2019 inductive argument as though it has\nbeen put forward as a \u2018strong\u2019 inductive argument. On his view,\nthe fallacy emerges only because of this interpretive error: the\ncritic employs a contentious and less than sympathetic reading\nof the discourse. Perhaps this is true, but Finocchiaro offers no\nevidence in support of his suggestion that people are claiming\na weak inductive connection between the evidence and the\nconclusion claim.\nA final allegation regarding the tendency of philosophers to\ninterpret tendentiously is made with reference to such fallacies\nas appeal to force and appeal to pity. Finocchiaro quotes Copi\u2019s\ndescriptions as \u2018appealing to force or the threat of force to cause\nacceptance ofaconclusion\u2019and\u2018appealing topityforthesakeof\ngetting a conclusion accepted\u2019.35In such cases, he says:\nthese could non-prejudicially, but along the same lines, be described as\n\u2018appealingtoforceortopitytocauseacceptanceofacertainproposition\nor to cause a certain action\u2019. When so described, they can be seen to be\nmethods, among others, of which giving an argument is one, in order\nto cause acceptance of a certain proposition. Being nonarguments, they\ncannot be logically incorrect arguments.36\nHere Finocchiaro tries to draw a fine distinction, between\nusing a statement as a premise to win acceptance of a further\nstatement as a supported conclusion and using a statement to\nwin acceptance of a further statement that is not exactly a\nconclusion to be drawn from evidence. The claim is to be\nbelievedasanonlogical,nonrationalresultofunderstandingthat\nfirst statement. This subtle distinction can doubtless be made,\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 297 but will be difficult to apply in practice. If we are distinguishing\ntypes of arguments and non-arguments on the basis of what\narguers and speakers \u2018claim\u2019, it difficult to see that any but the\nphilosophical elite would have the conceptual sophistication to\n\u2018claim\u2019whatthedistinctionrequires.AcritiqueofCopi\u2019saccount\nthat depends solely on its problems of application is quite\ncompelling.\nFinocchiaro might have made essentially the same point in a\nmuch simpler way. If a person is to be interpreted as offering\na fallacious argument, she must be interpreted as offering an\nargument. In many contexts, it is quite unclear whether people\nare in fact giving arguments. They may say one thing and then\nsayanother,andwemayhavenoclearideaastowhetherthefirst\nclaimistoprovideareasonforthesecondornot.InIntroduction\nto Logical Theory,P.F.Strawson put the point this way:\n\u2026 I have in mind such expressions as \u2018that is to say\u2019, \u2018in other words\u2019,\n\u2018more briefly\u2019. \u2018I mean\u2019. These are expressions which we sometimes\n(thoughnotalwaysoronly)useonoccasionsonwhichweshoulddescribe\nourselves, not as inferring or arguing, but rather as, say putting into\nother words something that has already been said, or repeating it with\nsomething left out, or summarizing it, or making a precis. There is no\nsharply definite line separating those steps which we should call steps\nin reasoning and those steps which we should describe in one of the\nalternative waysIhave listed.37\nIn such cases, seeing people as offering arguments is\nproblematic, and therefore interpreting them as offering\nfallacious arguments is problematic as well.\nConsider, for instance, the following, spotted on a billboard\nnear Salem, Ontario.\nJesus Christ died for our sins. Trust him.\nThese short statements might be regarded as elements of an\nargument, in which case we could regard that argument as an\nenthymeme having the missing premise \u2018Anyone who died for\n298TRUDYGOVIER our sins should be trusted\u2019. Enthymeme or not, the statements\nmight be taken as constituting an argument committing the\nfallacy of appealing to pity. Whether this allegation of fallacy is\nappropriate depends on our sense of whether the point of the\nmessage is that one should infer from Jesus\u2019 suffering on the\ncross to a conclusion that Jesus should be trusted. One might\ndefend such an interpretation by pointing out that Jesus\u2019 death\non the cross was extraordinarily painful; as an innocent and\nsufferingbeingwithahumanbody,Jesuswasatthatpointpitiful.\nOne might contest such an interpretation on the ground that\nJesus went to heaven and, for that reason, was not a being who\nshould be pitied. Thus, we may interpret these statements as\noffering an argument based on pity, or as offering an argument\nnot based on pity. Alternatively, we might regard the billboard\nas simply making two statements with no intended inferential\nrelationship between them.\nThere are many cases in which discourse can legitimately be\ninterpreted in several ways. Interpretive issues extend far\nbeyond the fallacies of appeal to force and appeal to pity.\nInterestingly enough, Finocchiaro\u2019s own paper illustrates this\nkindofinterpretiveunder-determination.Towardtheendofthe\npaper, he claims that, despite the difficulties he has found with\nfallaciesanalysis,findingerrorsinargumentsoffersmoreinsight\nthan finding them to be correct. He suggests that \u2018negative\nevaluation is methodologically more significant\u2019 than positive\nevaluation. Having given some reasons in support of this view,\nFinocchiaro adds these two sentences:\nThis corresponds to conclusions reached by other philosophers in other\ncontexts. For example, Karl Popper and his followers have stressed the\nprimacy of falsification and criticism as opposed to confirmation and\njustification in science; Henry W. Johnston Jr. has argued that, in\nphilosophy, criticalargumentsaremorefundamentalthanconstructive\nones; and Imre Lakatos has stressed the methodological importance of\nrefutation in mathematics.38\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 299 If these comments are intended to offer support for the greater\ninsight yielded by negative evaluation, one might accuse\nFinocchiaro of the fallacy of misusing authority. But if they are\njust added remarks, made to add interest to the view, such a\ncharge would be inappropriate. Which interpretation \u2013\nargument or non-argument \u2013 is appropriate is a moot point\nwhich could be argued either way. Some interpretive issues just\nare moot: life and language are like that. The problem does not\narise only for fallacies.\nThat we cannot achieve a reliable consensus about the\nidentification of fallacious arguments in such a case shows, not\nthat our logical understanding of fallacies is poor, but that the\ndistinction between arguments and nonarguments is sometimes\ndifficult to apply. It is entirely likely that some alleged appeals\nto force and pity are most plausibly interpreted in a way which\ndoesnotmakethemouttobearguments.Butwithnoexamples,\nFinocchiaro offers no evidence. Even if he had cited examples,\nonecouldpointoutthatsomecasesarenotall.Strictlyspeaking,\nthisproblemisnotaboutfallaciesassuchbutabouttheopenness\nof much discourse to diverse interpretations.\nFinocchiaro goes on to hypothesize that there is a certain\nprogressive pattern to philosophers\u2019 misinterpretations of\nnatural reasoning. An inductive argument is misrepresented as\ndeductive, a weakly inductive argument as strongly inductive,\nand a nonargument as an argument. The pattern of\nmisinterpretation pursued by those who find fallacies is\nthat of exaggerating the strength of the connection claimed between\nvarious assertions, or of creating one where none is claimed.39\nThis critique of fallacies analysis rests on a controversial and\nundefended theory of argument. Despite Finocchiaro\u2019s attacks\non texts for having inadequate examples, his own account has\nsingularly few. His hypothesis about fallacies is based on a hasty\ninference from the fact that some texts are found to be\ninadequate and that some classifications have been hasty.\n300TRUDYGOVIER Here,wehaveaprematureandhastyanalysis.YetFinocchiaro\nboldly states:\ntheconclusiontobedrawnfromtheabovediscussionisthattheconcept\nof a fallacy as a type of common but logically incorrect argument is\na chimera, since the various disputed practices usually referred to as\nfallacies are either not common or not logically incorrect or not\narguments.40\nThis sweeping conclusion is simply not warranted by the\nevidence put forward.\nFinocchiaro moves us away from formalism and deductivism.\nHe acknowledges that, given the possibility of good\nnondeductivearguments,thefallaciousnessofanargumentwi1l\nnot follow simply from the fact that it fails to be deductively\nvalid. He recognizes the role of interpretation in fallacies\nanalysis. Before appraising reasoning by whatever standard, we\nhavetodeterminewhatreasoningisused.Thatisaninterpretive\nproblem. We also have to determine somehow what standard\nof appraisal (deductive, inductive, or other) should be applied\nto the argument. If this interpretive work is done carelessly, a\ncharge of fa1lacy will be poorly supported. Often interpretation\niscarelessandsuchchargesareimplausible.Someexamplesand\nexplanations offered in texts and other sources are sloppy and\nunconvincing. But it is a large leap from these claims to the\nrevisionist view that there are no fallacies at all. In fact, that\nrevisionist view is strictly speaking incompatible with\nFinocchiaro\u2019s analysis, because he is commited to the claim that\noneparticularfallacy\u2013thestrawman\u2013occursfrequentlyinthe\npages of logic textbooks.\n4.Charity as Eliminating Fallacies\nThere is one popular way to link Finocchiaro\u2019s demand for\nmore sensitive interpretation with his conclusion that there are\nno fallacies, and that is by appealing to a strong principle of\ncharity. We might adopt a model of interpretation according\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 301 to which the best interpretation of an argument is always that\ninterpretation which makes it out to be the best argument. It\nis always possible to construct a version of an argumentative\npassage which contains no mistakes in reasoning. As explained\nearlier, one can simply insert the associated conditional as a\nmissing premise. And there are a variety of moves that can be\nemployed.\nIn any case in which discourse can be construed either as\nofferingapoorargumentorasofferingnoargument,wealways\nopt for the latter. Even where there is an argument, sentences\nthat are in fact irrelevant to the conclusion can be interpreted\nas comments which do not belong to the real premises so that\nirrelevance does not occur. Where indicator words make these\nmoves interpretively implausible, supplementary premises can\nbe added so that inference gaps are always filled, and any errors\nremaining are errors in belief, not in reasoning. Where\nappropriate, conclusions of the supposed argument can be\nqualified so that less is claimed and less support is needed.\nArgumentscanbetakenasbeingofaninferentiallyunambitious\ntype, as Finocchiaro proposed for alleged cases of the post hoc\nfallacy. Using a combination of such strategies, apparently\nfallacious arguments can be rendered as non-fallacies by\ncharitable interpretation.\nFinocchiaro does refer approvingly to charity. However, he\ndoesnotexplicitlyendorseaversionofitsostrongthatitwould\nin every case require one or more of the above moves. Others\nhavenotbeensocautious.Theprincipleofcharityisoftenstated\nso ambiguously and used so sweepingly that its application\nwould eliminate fallacies, both formal and informal.41\nStrong charity will suffice to eliminate fallacies. If our over-\nriding goal in interpretation is to interpret discourse so as to\nmakeitmaximally\u2018sensible\u2019,thenitwillbetoavoidallegingthata\nspeakerorwriterhasmadeanerrorinreasoning.Thus,ifstrong\ncharity is adopted as the guiding principle of interpretation,\nthere will be few if any fallacies. But strong charity can be\n302TRUDYGOVIER resisted for other reasons. Moderate charity, which is sensible\nandusableforgenuinelyinterpretivepurposes,willnotsufficeto\neliminate fallacies.\nConsider the following example of a chain letter, cited by\nGerald Nosich in his text,Reasons and Arguments.42\nTRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND HE WILL\nACKNOWLEDGE AND HE WILL LIGHT THE WAY.\nThis prayer was sent to you for luck. The original copy is from the\nNetherlands. It has been around the world ten times. The luck has been\nbrought to you. You\u2019re to receive good luck within four days of receiving\nthis letter. \u2018This is no joke.\u2019 You will receive it in the mail.\nSendcopiesofthislettertopeopleyouthinkneedgoodluck.Donotsend\nmoney, do not keep this letter.

Either to one of your friends, parents, or acquaintances.\nAn officer received $70,000. Don Colbert received $30,000 but lost it\nbecause he broke the chain. While in the Philippines General Welch lost\nhis life six days after he received this letter, he failed to circumstance the\nprayer. However, before he died he received $775,000.\nAfterafewdays,youwillreceiveasurprise.\u2018Thisistrueevenifyouare\nnot superstitious.\u2019 Take note of the following:\nConstantineBlackreceivedthechainin1933.Heaskedhissecretaryto\nmaketwentycopiesandsendthem.Afewdayslaterhewonalotteryinhis\ncountry for two million dollars.\nCarlosCrocbiteanofficeemployeereceivedthechain,heforgotit.Afew\ndayslater,helosthisjob.Hefoundthechainandsentittotwentypeople\nand five days later he received a better job.\nDoris Merchild received the chain and did not believe in it. Nine\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 303 dayslatershedied.FORNOREASONWHATSOEVERSHOULDTHIS\nCHAIN BE BROKEN.\nThe context and wording of this letter make it clear that the\nvarious anecdotes are supposed to support two conclusions:\n1. A person who, within ninety-six hours of receiving the\nletter, sends out twenty copies of it to appropriate people,\nwillreceivegoodluckwithinfourdaysofreceivingtheletter\nbecause he has treated the letter appropriately.\n2. A person who, within ninety-six hours of receiving the\nletter, does not send out twenty copies of it to appropriate\npeople will receive bad luck because he has not treated the\nletter appropriately.\nTo support (1), four cases of individuals who received the letter\nand then had good luck are cited. To support (2), four cases\nof individuals who did not behave properly after receiving the\nletter and had bad luck are cited.\nBothposthocandhastyinductivereasoningareinvolvedinthe\nuse of these anecdotes to support (1) and (2). No plausible use\nof a moderate charity principle can avoid this.

The\nstories told are to achieve this. Causal claims are required, and\nthe anecdotes are the only basis for them, in the written letter.\nKnowing what we do about the writers and readers of chain\n304TRUDYGOVIER letters,thereisnootherplausibleinterpretationofthisdiscourse\nwhichavoidsthechargeoffallacy.Onlyaprincipleofcharityso\nstrong as to outweigh all other relevant factors in interpretation\ncouldgiveadifferentresultforthispassage. Suchstrongcharity\nis not a plausible principle of interpretation.\n5. Concluding Comments\nFormal invalidity is not the whole story about fallacies. It may\nbe possible to show formal invalidity, provided we are willing\nto make preformal assumptions about paraphrasing, but doing\nthat will not be sufficient to yield a theory of fallacy. There are\nmanyreasonsforthisconclusion.Somefallacies,suchasbegging\nthe question and straw man, can be committed even when an\nargument is valid. Also, many arguments are non-deductive and\nstandards of deductive validity are irrelevant to their appraisal\nas adequate or inadequate. Furthermore, the issue of proper\ninterpretation looms large for fallacy theory. A proper theory\nof interpretation is needed \u2013 ruling out strong charity and\nincorporating moderate charity. Revisionism about fallacies has\nbeen tempting because there are so many unresolved and\nrelevant issues in the theory of argument. However, such\nrevisionism is unwarranted and premature. There is no fallacy\nbehind fallacies.\nNotes\n1. Karel Lambert and William Ulrich, The Nature of Argument,\n(New York: Macmillan, 1980 argue there are no informal\nfallacies. Maurice Finocchiaro, \u2018Fallacies and the Evaluation of\nReasoning\u2019(AmericanPhilosophicalQuarterly18(1981),pp.13-22)\nsuspects thatfallacies occuronlyintextbooks. Gerald J.Massey,\n\u2018Are There any Good Arguments that Bad Arguments are Bad?\u2019,\n(Philosophy in Context, 4 (1975), pp. 61-77); \u2018In Defense of the\nAsymmetry\u2019, (Philosophy in Context, 4, Supplement, pp. 44-56);\nand\u2018TheFallacyBehindFallacies\u2019,(MidwestStudiesinPhilosophy5,\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 305 (1980), pp. 489-50;) claims that fallacy theory falls apart because\nwe can never demonstrate formal invalidity. Daniel Dennett,\nBrainstorms, (Montgomery, VT: Bradford Books, 1978) and L.\nJonathanCohen,\u2018ArePeopleProgrammedtoCommitFallacies?\u2019\n(JournalfortheTheoryofSocialBehavior,12,pp.251-274)and\u2018On\nthe Psychology of Prediction: Whose is the Fallacy?\u2019, (Cognition,\n7, pp. 385-407) adopt principles of interpretation that would\neliminate or virtually eliminate fallacies.\n2. For similar definitions, see John Woods and Douglas Walton,\nArgument: The Logic of the Fallacies (Toronto: McGraw-Hill\nRyerson,1982):\u2018afallacyisanargumentthatisatrickydeception\nbecause it is incorrect, even while it has a tendency to seem\ncorrect\u2019.

S.F. Barker, in the third edition of Elements of\nLogic (Englewood Cliffs, N.J: Prentice Hall, 1981), says \u2018A fallacy\nis a logical mistake in reasoning. When there are premises and\na conclusion that, through some logical error, is mistakenly\nthought to be proved by them, then and only then, is there a\nfallacy in the logical sense.\u2019 For empirical evidence that people\ncommit a variety of inductive fallacies, see Human Inference:\nStrategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment, by social\npsychologists R. Nisbett and Lee Ross. (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:\nPrentice Hall, 1980.)\n3.In\u2018ACommentonFallaciesandArgumentAnalysis\u2019,T.Carroll\ncontends that a similar definition of mine makes deception an\nessential element of fallacy in such a way that the arguer must\nintend to deceive the audience if he or she is to be arguing\nfallaciously. This criticism fails to distinguish between\ndeceptiveness as a tendency to deceive and actual deception.\nActual deception is not required for fallacy; nor is intent to\ndeceive. What is required is that fallacious arguments will\n306TRUDYGOVIER themselves be deceptive in the sense that they will have features\nsuch that people will tend to mistake them for good arguments.\n(T.

Nosich, Reasons and Arguments (Belmont, Calif:\nWadsworth, 1982), pp. 58-59.\n310TRUDYGOVIER CHAPTER 10.\nFORMALISM AND INFORMALISM IN THEORIES\nOF REASONING AND ARGUMENT\nIn this chapter I questioned the notion that argument interpretation\nand evaluation are matters of science, as distinct from art. Another\nversion of this material was printed in the Computers and\nPhilosophy Newsletter (Stanford University, Volume 4, December\n1989, submitted 1987). That context was an early discussion of\nartificial intelligence and its prospects. Following the reflections of\ncritics such as Hubert Dreyfus, I was inclined to be skeptical about the\nmatter. Dreyfus and others argued that to understand discourse, we\nneeded considerable background knowledge and awareness of context.\nHisskepticismwassupportedbythatofmycomputerscientisthusband\nAnton Colijn, who was fond of saying that artificial intelligence was\njustaroundthecorner,andthatwaswhereitwouldalwaysbe.(Hestill\nsays this but less frequently than before.) I argued here for the claim\nthatstrictrulescannotbeprovidedforalgorithmsrequiredbyartificial\nintelligence. But perhaps the presumption that strict (universal,\nexception-less)ruleswouldbeneededwassomewhatna\u00efve.Iadmitthat\nI am not in a position to know.\nIn the eighties skeptical persons such as myself questioned the idea\nthat algorithmic processes could support machine translation. Now,\ndecadeslater,machinetranslationexistsandeventheskepticsofearlier\ndecades have been known to resort to \u2018Google Translate\u2019 on occasion.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 311 The results, I gather, tend to be helpful but by no means elegant or\nsmooth.\nCurrent discussions and concerns about artificial intelligence are\nwide-ranging. Some thinkers, including Stephen Hawking and the\nOxford philosopher, Nick Bostrom, fear AI capable of super-human\nintelligence and motivated to destroy humankind. How relevant are\nphilosophical questions about the connection between consciousness,\nthought, and intelligence? Mind, machine and body? What is the\nsignificanceoffactsaboutartificialintelligencesystemsbeatingexperts\nat the games of chess (Garry Kasparov) and Go (Lee Sedol)? Many\nworry about widespread automation eliminating needed jobs. More\nlimited concerns involve issues of legal and moral responsibility for\naccidents involving self-driving cars, or a flaw in an expert system\nleading to a faulty diagnosis and premature death. The reflections in\nthis chapter are, at best, marginally relevant to these current problems\nand anxieties.\nWhen this chapter was written, I thought that one needed\nconsiderable background knowledge and a good sense of context and\nnuancetounderstandwhetheranargumentwasputforwardandwhat\nthat argument was. I also thought that there was usually one correct\nanswer to such questions. Now I would continue to support the first\npresumption while being less confident about the second. The notion of\ngeneral rules holding most but not all of the time, being sound, other\nthings being equal (ceteris paribus) is reasonable. Of late, the phrase\npro tanto seems to have replaced ceteris paribus, but the message\nremains the same.\nIf I were to question a central aspect of this chapter it would concern\nthe assumption that strict exception-less rules for interpretation of\ndiscourse are not to be found. That claim, made in the latter part of\nthechapter,feelsover-confidenttometoday.Perhapsthecuesandhints\nusedbyhumaninterpreterscanbecoded.Istillfeelinclinedtodoubtit,\nbut admit that my doubt is based on an imperfect understanding of the\npossibilities.\nIn our century, logic is typically identified with formal logic,\n312TRUDYGOVIER and formal logic is the study of proofs and rules of inference\nin axiomatized formal systems. Logic is also regarded as the\nscience of argument assessment, as a study that will teach us\nhow to understand and appraise the justificatory reasoning that\npeople actually use. Logic is supposed to be both scientific and\npractical. Some texts advise that logic \u2018operates like a machine\nfulfilling its function no matter who is pressing the button\u2019, that\nit is a \u2018science for evaluating argument\u2019, that it is too objective to\ndepend on \u2018insights, intuitions, or feelings\u2019. There is a tension in\nthese views of logic. We cannot have it both ways \u2013 that logic\nis entirely formal and yet applies to real argumentation. Either\nlogic includes much that is nonformal or it tells us only a small\namount of what we need to know to understand and evaluate\narguments.\nInfact,argumentevaluationismoreanartthanascience.Itis\nnot something that can be mechanized, and that has important\nconsequences for the development of artificial intelligence\nsystems. Understanding and evaluating arguments is an\nimportant part of human intelligence. If this cannot be done by\nrules and if artificial intelligence (even in its most sophisticated\nforms) must proceed by the application of rules, then there will\nbe a necessary incompleteness to artificial intelligence. There\nwill be a range of tasks it cannot fully accomplish. Such, at least,\nis the implication of the analysis developed here. To be sure, we\ncan sometimes recast natural argumentation in the symbolism\nof formal systems and reach a conclusion about the deductive\nmerits of the inferences upon which they depend. Frequently\nthis is not possible, and even when it is, accomplishing the task\npresupposes significant nonformal insights.\nArgument interpretation and evaluation form an art, an art\nrequiring insight and judgment. This art can be cultivated by\npractice and enhanced by the teaching of rules of various kinds,\nbut it cannot be exhaustively characterized by articulated rules\n\u2014formalorotherwise. This canbeshownevenifweignorethe\naspect of premise evaluation, which would be admitted by all to\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 313 require general knowledge of the world. Even when we restrict\nourselvestotheinterpretationoflanguageandtheevaluationof\ninferences, arguing well and criticizing well require more than\nthemechanicalapplicationofrules.Itisnotreasonabletoexpect\nmechanical decisions for the understanding and evaluation of\nsubstantive argumentation.\nThelackofformalizationininformallogicneithermakesthat\nsubject an intellectual sham nor shows it to be a primitive stage\non the way to a full understanding of argument. To speak of\ninformal logic is not to contradict oneself but to acknowledge\nwhat should be obvious: that the understanding of natural\narguments requires substantive knowledge and insight not\ncaptured in the rules of axiomatized systems. The informal\nfallacies, historically a central topic in informal logic, involve\nmistakes in reasoning that are relatively common, but neither\nformal nor formally characterizable in any useful way. The fact\nthatanaccountofaninformalfallacymakesitouttobejustthat\ndoes not show that it is imprecise or lacking in rigour.\nThe development, understanding, and evaluation of\nargumentation is far from being a mechanical task. It is a\nmisunderstanding both of argumentation and of the human\nintelligence that constructs it to think that what goes on must\nbe exhaustively representable in formal rules. To put the point\nprovocatively, though computers may derive formulae, they\ndon\u2019t construct, understand, or appraise substantive\nargumentation. The evaluation of a colloquial nonformal\nargument is something quite different from the appraisal of a\nformal derivation by applying formal rules of inference.\nl.Interpretationas aNonformalProcess\nComprehension is an unformalizable process striving towards an\nunspecifiableachievementandisaccordinglyattributedtotheagencyofa\ncentreseeking satisfaction in the light of its own standard.1\nTo understand an argument, we must first understand the\n314TRUDYGOVIER language in which its constituent sentences are expressed. The\nunderstanding of natural language presupposes much\nbackground knowledge that is substantive, not merely syntactic.\nIt also requires the ability to grasp the meaning of aberrant and\nodd combinations not prescribed by the \u2018rules\u2019. Difficulties in\ncompletely formalizing rules for the understanding of natural\nlanguage as it is actually used are well known and have been\nmuch discussed.\nThe literary analyst Stanley Fish, among others, has pointed\nouttheextenttowhichmeaningdependsoncontext.Fishargues\nconvincingly that even such apparently simple expressions as\n\u2018private members only\u2019 can be given an amazing variety of\ninterpretations, provided we invent a corresponding variety of\ncontexts of use. He resists the idea that any one context is\n\u2018normal\u2019 in a sense that would make the meaning of an\nexpression in that context its real or literal meaning.\nA sentence neither means anything at all, nor does it always mean\nthe same thing; it always has the meaning that has been conferred\non it by the situation in which it is uttered. Listeners always know\nwhat speech act is being performed, not because there are limits to the\ni1locutionary usestowhich sentences canbeput,butbecause inanyset\nofcircumstancestheillocutionaryforceasentencemayhavewillalready\nhave been determined.2\nMachine translation has bogged down, except in carefully\nrestricted domains, because of the necessity of referring to an\napparently infinite amount of background knowledge.3\nLess commonly remarked are those aspects of understanding\nthatarepertinenttotheidentificationofsentencesascomprising\nan argument. To see a sequence of sentences as an argument is\nnot only to understand the meaning of those sentences but to\nregard some of them as put forward to offer rational support\nfor others. This understanding requires a notion of \u2018logical flow\u2019,\nand the imputation of an intent to justify a claim or claims to an\nidentified, or hypothetical, arguer. We have seen that pragmatic\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 315 factors serve to distinguish argument from explanation. The\nsame may be said about the distinction between argument and\ndescription, narration, exemplification, jokes, and so on.\nThe relevance of context, human purposes, and background\ninformation to the understanding of an argument makes it\nimpossible to identify arguments solely by reference to general\nlists of semantic and syntactic cues. The need for argument, the\npresence of argument, and the direction of argument are\ndetermined on the basis of our sense of what is going on.\nConsider the following example from Stuart Hampshire\u2019s book\non Spinoza.\nAphilosopherhasalwaysbeenthoughtofassomeonewhotriestoachieve\na complete view of the universe as a whole, and of man\u2019s place in the\nuniverse; he has traditionally been expected to answer those questions\nabout the design and purpose of the universe, and of human life, which\nthe various special sciences do not claim to answer; philosophers have\ngenerally been conceived as unusually wise or all-comprehending men\nwhose systems are answers to those large, vague questions about the\npurposesofhumanexistencewhichpresentthemselvestomostpeopleat\nsome period of their lives. Spinoza fulfills all these expectations.4\nFew persons schooled in the history of philosophy would\ninterpret Hampshire as arguing here. Yet many introductory\nphilosophystudentsunderstoodthepassageasanargumentwith\nthe unstated conclusion that Spinoza was a philosopher. If we\nregardedthisclaimasoneHampshirewastryingtojustify,andif\nwe thought Hampshire was the sort of writer who would argue\nabout philosophy by pointing out what ordinary people have\noften thought, we might read the passage this way. (Spinoza\nfulfills the common expectation of what philosophers are like;\ntherefore Spinoza is a philosopher.) Such a reading is\nimplausible, butittakesbackgroundknowledgetoseethat.This\nis not to deny, of course, that in some other context it might be\nappropriate to try to prove that Spinoza is a philosopher. For\nexample,ifoneweredisputingwithalogicalpositivistonemight\ntrytoprovethatpoint.Butinthatcontexttheordinaryperson\u2019s\n316TRUDYGOVIER casual assumptions as to what philosophy is would hardly be a\nplausible starting point for the argument.\nSimilar points may be made about the identification of\npremises and conclusions. Once we have understood the\nsentences of a discourse and have understood that the discourse\nis a justificatory one, there remains the further task of\ndetermining which sentences are premises and which are\nconclusions. Such matters are taken for granted but are by no\nmeans purely routine. Consider, for instance, the following\nrelatively well-ordered and simple passage, which caused many\nundergraduates significant difficulty.\nPhilosophers of science are fond of claiming that a theory or model\ncan never he disproved by a new fact, or even a set of facts, but only\nby a new and more comprehensive theory. While this may be a useful\nrule of thumb, it suggests misleadingly that individual findings cannot\nhave revolutionary reverberations. In fact, when a solar eclipse in 1919\nshowed that certain predictions by Einstein of the way light would be\ndeflected were correct, the theory of relativity gained immeasurably in\nstature. Conversely, proponents of the theory that intelligence is\ninherited suffered a severe blow when data presented by Sir Cyril Burt\nwere shown to be fraudulent.5\nThis passage is the opening paragraph of an article which\ndescribes the artistic skills of an autistic child called Nadia,\nwhose developmental pattern in drawing was so unusual as to\nupset previously confirmed theories on how children\u2019s drawing\ndevelops.6 Many students, asked to analyze the passage,\nidentified \u2018it suggests misleadingly that individual findings\ncannot have revolutionary reverberations\u2019 as the conclusion.\nOthers thought that the conclusion was to be found in the first\nsentence.\nThe first two sentences serve as background; the author\ndescribes a common view, and then points out that this view is\nmisleadinginitssuggestionthatindividualfindingscannothave\nrevolutionaryimplicationsinscience.Tosaythatitismisleading\nis to suggest that the implied view is false. Indeed, that point is\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 317 what can be supported by the next two sentences. The words\n\u2018In fact\u2019 indicate that at this point the author turns from the\n\u2018misleading implication\u2019 of a common view to his own line of\nthought. \u2018Conversely\u2019, introducing the final sentence, marks the\ncontrast between a confirming instance and a disconfirming\ninstance. To properly understand this passage, we have to be\nsensitive to the tone of the background comments (in \u2018while\nthis may be\u2019), see that the author is rebutting the misleading\nimplication of the standard view. We have to see how the two\ninstances described serve as the basis for this rebuttal. The\npassage mixes description, argument, and meta-comment; the\nmeta-levelcommentisnotproperlypartoftheargument,though\nit helps us to identify that argument.\nThispassage,thoughnotespeciallytrickyorexciting,indicates\nhow much understanding is involved in the extraction of an\nargument from natural discourse. Such extraction requires\nsemantic knowledge, syntactic knowledge, background factual\nknowledge, contextual awareness, and a general sense of how\nthings\u2018hangtogetherlogically\u2019.Logicallycompetentlistenersand\nreaders do much to extract the \u2018logic\u2019 of an argument from\nnatural discourse, even in a case that is fairly straightforward.\nStill more subtle semantic and background knowledge is\ninvolved in the understanding of the following argument from\nJohn Locke. The argument is a valid modus tollens and would\nnaturally be read as such by philosophically trained readers.\nHowever, considerable recasting of the original wording is\nrequired in order to set it out explicitly in this form.\nSyllogism is not the great instrument of reason. For if syllogism must\nbe taken for the only proper instrument and means of knowledge, then\nbeforeAristotletherewasnotonemanthatdidorcouldknowanything\nbyreason;andthatsincetheinventionofsyllogismthereisnotoneoften\nthousandthatdoes.ButGodhasnotbeensosparingtomenastomake\nthem barely two-legged creatures, and left it to Aristotle to make them\nrational.7\n318TRUDYGOVIER Understanding that Locke uses a modus tollens inference here\nrequires understanding \u2018syllogism is the great instrument of\nreason\u2019 and \u2018syllogism must be taken for the only proper\ninstrument andmeansofknowledge\u2019tomeanthesamething,in\nthis context. (They would not necessarily mean the same thing\nin other contexts.) We must also take the last sentence to be a\nrhetorically emphatic and original way of saying that it is not\nknowledge of the syllogism that makes men rational; this claim\ndenies the consequent of the second sentence. At this point we\nhaveanargumentwhosevaliditycanbeappraisedmechanically.\nHowever, to cast the argument in the form in which this is\npossible, we must make significant and subtle interpretive\nmoves. These presume background knowledge, a sense for\nrhetorical flourish, and much more.\nSuchnonformalcapabilitiesare,ofcourse,alsocalledintoplay\nwhen argumentative discourse relies on unstated premises or\nconclusions. Howard Posposel quoted the following argument\nfromaphilosophicalpaperbyHansHahn,thinkingitsuitablefor\nstudentstopracticesymbolizationandtheapplicationofvalidity\ntests to natural material. Its proper interpretation, however,\npresumes a degree of sensitivity and knowledge which would\nseem to make it unsuitable for that role.\nThe old conception of logic is approximately as follows: logic is the\naccount of the most universal properties of things, the account of those\nproperties which are common to all things; just as ornithology is the\nscienceofbirds,zoologythescienceofallanimals,biologythescienceof\nalllivingbeings,sologicisthescienceofallthings,thescienceofbeingas\nsuch.Ifthiswerethecase,itwouldremainwhollyunintelligiblewhence\nlogic derives its certainty. For we surely do not know all things. We\nhavenotobservedeverything,andhencewecannotknowhoweverything\nbehaves.8\nTo understand this passage argumentatively we must read the\nlong first sentence as background, see that the final sentence\nencapsulates a subargument, see that the subargument supports\nthe claim in the second last sentence, see that the second last\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 319 sentence together with an unstated premise supports the\nconditional sentence, and supply a final conclusion from an\ninterpretation of the conditional sentence. To say the least, a lot\nof work is involved. The result:\n1. We have not observed everything,\nthus,\n2. We cannot know how everything behaves.\nthus,\n3. We do not know all things.\nSo,\n4. If logic were the science of the most universal properties of all\nthings, logic would have no certainty.\n5. Missing Premise: Logichas certainty.\nTherefore,\n6. Missing Conclusion: Logic is not the science of the most\nuniversal properties of all things.\nThe conclusion, which is implicit, is derived from a stated\npremise and an implicit premise by modus tollens. There is an\nargumenthere,andwecanunderstandit,butourunderstanding\npresumes deletion, rearranging, and addition.\nThe first sentence is regarded as background and deemed not\nto be a premise because it is a description of an old conception\nnot endorsed by the author. The rearranging of the last two\nsentences, yielding two subarguments, is based on the presence\nof \u2018hence\u2019 as an indicator word and the logical relations we\nperceive between not observing everything, not knowing how\neverything behaves, and not knowing everything. The addition\nof the premise is based on background knowledge as to what\nphilosophers in general and Hahn in particular typically assume\naboutlogic,aswellasonourperceptionthattheadditionofsuch\n320TRUDYGOVIER a premise would make sense of the stated material: it generates\na deductively valid argument yielding the implicit conclusion.\nThe conclusion is added on the basis of the wording (\u2018if this\nwere the case\u2019) and background knowledge as to what logical\npositivists thought about logic and metaphysics. We can see that\nthe interpretation of this passage as expressing a deductively\nvalidargument isacomplexandintricate task.Itisbynomeans\npurelymechanical.Infact,alltheseexamplesindicatehowmuch\nbackground knowledge, subtle verbal knowledge, and sense of\nlogical direction are involved, merely in the identification of an\nargument.\nThe primary task of logic is the appraisal of inferences. In\narguments, premises are the basis for inferring conclusions, and\nlogic proper has the task of telling us whether it is legitimate\nto infer the conclusions from the premises. But extensive\ninterpretation is needed for us to see where inferences are. This\ninterpretive process is preformal and, on many accounts,\nprelogical.\nWhat is uncontroversially logical is inference appraisal. Here\ntoo insight is required. We may use rules to evaluate inferences,\nbut we have to see the argument as one of a type to know which\nsorts of rules to apply. The problem has often been raised, by\nMassey, Finocchiaro, and others.9 It may be illustrated by the\nfollowing simple example.\nIfit\u2019sraining,thestreetsarewet.Thestreetsareawfullywet,soIguess\nit has been raining.\nWe can find here a flawed deductive inference. If we regard the\nreasoning as deductive we will see it as a case of the fallacy of\naffirming the consequent. We can also look at it as a case of\ninference to the best explanation. Our sense of what is going\non in the argument, of what the argument \u2018hinges on\u2019, how the\npremises are supposed to lead to the conclusion, is presumed\nby our application of rules. We not only have to identify the\npremises and conclusion, we have to isolate the basic\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 321 argumentative structure, seeing which terms are crucial for the\nlogical workings of the argument and which are not so as to\nunderstandhowthepremisesaresupposedtologicallyleadtothe\nconclusion.\nRules do not tell us how to interpret or apply themselves. To\nthink that they did would be to commit ourselves to an infinite\nregress of rules. This point, associated in our day with the later\nwritings of Wittgenstein, was in fact anticipated by Kant.\nIf it (general logic) sought to give instructions how we are to subsume\nunder these rules, thatis,todistinguishwhether something does ordoes\nnotcomeunderthem,thatcouldonlybebymeansofanotherrule.This\nin turn, for the very reason that it is a rule, again demands guidance\nfrom judgment. Thus it appears that, though understanding is capable\nof being instructed, and of being equipped with rules, judgment is a\npeculiar talent which can be practiced only, and cannot be taught. It\nis the specific quality of so-called mother-wit; and its lack no school\ncan make good. For although an abundance of rules borrowed from the\ninsightofothersmayindeedbeofferedto,andasitwere,graftedupon,a\nlimitedunderstanding,thepowerofrightlyemployingthemmustbelong\nto the learner himself; and in the absence of such a natural gift no\nrules that may be prescribed to him for this purpose can ensure against\nmisuse.10\nBefore we appraise inferences using rules (formal or\notherwise),bothinterpretiveandclassificatoryworkisrequired.\nSuch work presumes substantive knowledge, sensitivity to\ncontext, appreciation of nuances of meaning in context,\nrecognition of subarguments, addition of implicit premises and\nconclusions, and the classification of arguments and\nsubarguments as being of one type or another. This work is not\ndone by the application of formal rules. To suppose that it is\nnot only runs counter to what we know about the relevance\nof context to meaning, it is introspectively implausible.\nFurthermore, to require rules for every move will lead to a\nregress of rules.\nSome who seek a formal understanding of natural language\n322TRUDYGOVIER would no doubt insist that in principle rules can be articulated\nto handle all of this. One can insist that whatever is done must\nbe done by the application of rules. However, there is little to\nbe said in favour of such a view and at least an infinite regress\nargument working against it.11 Given the sensitivity to context\nand nuances of meaning, substantive background knowledge,\nandsenseoflogicaldirectionrequiredtoidentifyargumentation\nin natural discourse, the insistence that \u2018in principle\u2019 there are\nformalrulesthatcoverallofthisseemsaprioriandunwarranted.\nHumanbeingsdonotseemtothemselvesortoobserverstobefollowing\nstrict rules. On the contrary, they seem to be using global perceptual\norganization, making pragmatic distinctions between essential and\ninessential operations, appealing to paradigm cases, and using a shared\nsense of the situation to get their meanings across. Of course all this\norderlybutapparentlynon-rule-guidedactivitymightnonethelessbethe\nresultofunconsciouslyfollowedrules.Butwhenonetriestounderstand\nthis as a philosophical proposal that all behavior must be understood\nas following from a set of instructions, one finds a regress of rules for\napplying rules.12\n2.Form, Structure, and Logical Analogies\nIt is only in the context of a specific argument that we can say that a\nsentenceoughttobeanalyzedas,say,relationalratherthancategorical.\nIn some other argument, the same sentence might be properly be\nanalyzedinoppositefashion.13(StephenBarker,inElementsofLogic.)\nUsingalogicalanalogy,wecanonoccasionrefuteanargument\nby showing that another argument, relevantly similar to it, is\ninadequate. The second argument must duplicate the logical\nstructure of the first and be flawed in an obvious way. Either\nit must have true premises and a false conclusion, or it must\nin some other way be transparently \u2018absurd\u2019. The technique of\nrefutation by logical analogy is nonformal, in the sense that it\ndoesnotrequiretranslationfromnaturalintoformallanguage.It\nmaybeusedbyuntrainedpeopleinasensitiveandrevealingway.\nItissometimesdescribedas\u2018themethodofcounterexample\u2019and\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 323 thought to reveal deductive invalidity. Such a construal suggests\nthat the technique reveals deductive relationships, but in an\ninformal way.14\nInterestingly, the technique of logical analogy is applicable to\nnondeductive arguments as well as to deductive ones. The\nsuggestion that A caused B because A preceded B can be\ncountered by logical analogy; yet causal reasoning is standardly\nregarded as inductive. The suggestion that homosexuality is\nwrong because it is unnatural can be countered by logical\nanalogy,andthemostnaturalwayoftakingthatargumentwould\nbe as conductive in the sense of offering a relevant but not\nsufficient reason for the conclusion.\nThe technique of logical analogy is pertinent to our present\ntopic in two ways. First, it reveals again the web of nonformal\njudgments that enter into the understanding of an argument.\nSecond, it typically serves to isolate as the structure of an\nargument something that is not formal in any standard sense of\nthatterm.Thisphenomenonraisesthequestionofthefeasibility\nor desirability of formally expressing rules for material\ninferences. The use of logical analogy illustrates how nonformal\njudgments are presumed in the understanding of arguments,\nbecause it requires that we distinguish those aspects of the\nargument that are essential to its inferential relationships from\nthose that are incidental. Of course, this same distinction is also\ntacitly at work when we represent natural arguments in formal\nlanguages. What we regard as the correct logical form of an\nargument depends on preformal judgments about how that\nargument works \u2013 which are its significant and which its\ninsignificant features. In logical analogies, the structure of an\nargument is identified and duplicated, and an inference is\ncriticized by parallel argument.\nLetusconsidertwoexamples.Thefirstistakenfromabookby\nBritish doctor and child expert, Penelope Leach. Discussing the\nissue of whether group child care arrangements are suitable for\nchildren under three years of age, Leach says:\n324TRUDYGOVIER Many people would argue that while all of the foregoing is, or may be\ntrue, toddlers who are actually committed to group-care soon grow out\nofbeingtoddlersandthereforebecomesocializedmorequicklythanthey\nwould have done at home. \u2018The others will lick him into shape and he\u2019ll\nlearn by imitating them\u2019 \u2026 People who take this line are usually those\nwhowantverymuchtobelievethatgroupcareisacceptableforthevery\nyoung, and who therefore use the observable fact that they do survive\nanddevelop,onewayoranother,asevidencetosupportit.Sogobackto\nthat thirteen year-old who finds herself in charge of the family.

No, of course not. Nobody would argue\nthat, because nobody has any stake in the thirteen-year-olds running\nfamilies. But it is the same argument. Just as it is more appropriate\nfor that girl to acquire maternal and household responsibilities out of\nmature sexuality than tragic deprivation, so it is better for the toddler\ntoacquiresocializedbehavioroutofself-motivatedmaturityratherthan\nsad necessity.15\nAs the crux of the argument she criticizes, Leach identifies the\ninference from the fact that children can develop and adapt in\ngroup care to the conclusion that group care is acceptable for\nthesechildren.Shemarksthesignificantmoveintheargumentas\nbeing that of inferring acceptability from de facto developmental\nadequacy as attested by adaptation and survival. This \u2018core\u2019 of\nthe original argument is then paralleled in the case of the teen-\nage girl. In that analogous case, Leach asserts, one would not\ninfer the conclusion from the premise; hence one should not do\nit in the original case (the toddler) either. The logically parallel\nargument is without force; the original argument \u2013 called \u2018the\nsame argument\u2019 \u2013 is therefore also without force.\nA second example comes from Stanley Cavell\u2019s discussion of\nC.L. Stevenson\u2019s noncognitivism in ethics.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 325 For then (that is, on a noncognitivist account) we are going to have to\nset up a display of humorous tolerance and allow that some \u2018ethical\u2019\ndisagreements cannot be \u2018settled\u2019 \u2018rationally\u2018 on such grounds as this:\nwhatever reasons are offered them, when \u2018an oversexed, emotionally\nindependent adolescent argues with an undersexed, emotionally\ndependentoneaboutthedesirabilityoffreelove\u2019,theirdisagreementmay\nbe\u2018permanentlyunresolved\u2019.Youmightaswellsaythatifthesetwowent\non permanently arguing about whether men do or do not descend from\napes,thenthescienceofbiologywouldlackan\u2018exhaustive\u2019or\u2018definitive\u2019\nmethod of proof.16\nCavell identifies Stevenson\u2019s line of argument as one in which\nde facto failure by two mis-matched individuals to resolve a\ndispute is grounds for the permanent unresolvability of that\ndispute and ultimately a basis for concluding that the subject\nin which the dispute occurs lacks a definitive method of proof.\nCavell draws a logical analogy by mirroring this line of\nreasoning, substituting biology for ethics. Assuming that his\naudiencewillbeunwillingtoinfereitherthatbiologicaldisputes\nare permanently unresolvable or that biology lacks a definitive\nmethodofproof,Cavelltakeshimselftohaverefutedtheoriginal\nline of reasoning.17\nRefutation bylogical analogy isbased onduplicating the\u2018core\u2019\nofanargumentwhilevaryingsomeorallnon-essential features.\nIn the toddler example, the core of the argument is: \u2018x survives\nin C; therefore C is acceptable for x\u2019, with \u2018survives in\u2019 and\n\u2018acceptablefor\u2019beingthefocalconceptsoftheinference.Cavell\u2019s\nargumentshaveastheircore:\u2018xandy,whoaretemperamentally\nmismatched, disagree about z; therefore disputes about z are\nirresolvable; therefore subject S, in which z is located, has no\ndefinitive method of proof.\u2019\nIn its natural use, the technique of logical analogy makes this\nlogical core apparent by repetition rather than by articulation.\nThelogicalessentialsoftheargumentarerepeatedintheparallel\nargument and we \u2018see\u2019 them as we see sameness of shape in a\nblue circle and a red circle. The common structure is identified\n326TRUDYGOVIER without being represented as a separate item. This common\nstructure is the core of the argument. It is the part of the\nargument that must be preserved in the logical analogue. It is\nthe aspect essential to the way the premises and conclusion are\nto connect in the original argument. When we represent this\ncore, substituting letters for variable elements in the argument,\nwe have what might be called a primitive formalization of the\nargument.\nAt this point, a question arises as to whether this logical \u2018core\u2019\nshould be regarded as the form of the argument. On some\naccounts of logical form, this would be the case.18 However,\nthe central terms (\u2018survives in\u2019, \u2018acceptable for\u2019, \u2018temperamentally\nmismatched\u2019, \u2018has no definitive method of proof\u2019, and so on) are\nnot in any standard sense logical words. They are not\nsyncategorematic, as are \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, \u2018not\u2019, \u2018if then\u2019, \u2018necessary\u2019, and\n\u2018possible\u2019, nor even close to being syncategorematic as are such\ntermsas\u2018know\u2019and\u2018ought\u2019,aroundwhichepistemicanddeontic\nlogics have been developed.19 There is no formal system that\nwould encompass the above structures as its basic structures\nin any way analogous to that in which modus ponens is a basic\nstructure in propositional logic. Furthermore, for reasons we\nshallexplorelateranyattempttoconstructsuchaformalsystem\nwould seem misguided.20 The shared structure is not a formal\nstructure; it is a meaning structure, one shared by several\narguments and shareable by more. Thus, commonality is not\nformality.\nSuccessfully using the technique of logical analogy means\nidentifying the core of an argument, the forms or meanings on\nwhich its connection of premises and conclusion depends, and\nreproducing this core in another argument in which some or all\nof the other elements are varied. This understanding requires\nthe ability to see that some terms are essential to the way an\nargumentissupposedtowork,whereasothersareincidental.We\nmight term this the capacity for logical insight.\nThis capacity is presumed even when we formally represent\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 327 suchsimpleargumentsas\u2018Peterissad;Joeissad;thereforePeter\nand Joe are sad\u2019. Representing this argument as \u2018R; S; therefore\nR,S\u2019, we indicate that it depends on the way assertion and\nconjunction work, and not on who Peter and Joe are, or on the\nfact that they are both said sad. Nor does it depend on the fact\nthat they are both said to possess the same characteristic, or on\nthefactthatthischaracteristicissadness.Barker\u2019scommentthat\nthe same sentence may have different \u2018forms\u2019 when it appears\nin different arguments is illustrated here. If the argument were\n\u2018Peterissad;Joeissad;thereforethereareatleasttwosadpeople\u2019,\nwe would have to formalize so as to reveal that it is one and the\nsamepropertybothPeterandJoepossess.Alsowewouldneedto\nindicate that Peter and Joe are distinct individuals.\nDistinguishing the essential from the incidental can require\ngoing behind surface grammatical structure. For instance, few\nphilosopherswoulddeemthesetwoargumentstosharethesame\nlogical form:\n1. Joe is famous; anyone who is famous is rich; therefore Joe is rich.\n2. Sherlock Holmes is fictional; anyone who is fictional is real;\ntherefore Sherlock Holmes is real.\nEven though (2) is, on one level, semantically parallel to (1),\nthere is something \u2018fishy\u2019 about (2). We might say that in (2) the\nsecondpremiseisclearlyfalse,andregardthedifferencebetween\n(2) and (1) as being solely due to that fact. Such a view would\nmean regarding (1) and (2) as having the same form, that of a\ndeductively valid argument. However, few will wish to proceed\ninthisway.Wewillhesitate,because(2)uses\u2018fictional\u2019and\u2018real\u2019,\nwhere (1) uses standard predicates. To grant that (2) has the\nsame form as (1) requires us to ignore this difference, and the\ndifference is too important to gloss over in this way.\nThis example illustrates again how preformal judgments enter\ninto decisions as to what the form of an argument is. Formal\nanalysesoftenhelpustodeterminewhetherargumentsarevalid\n328TRUDYGOVIER ornot.However,theyalsoarticulateourpreformaljudgmentsof\nvalidityandinvalidity,andprovideavehicleinwhichweexpress\nthose judgments. If the validity of an argument is pre-formally\ncontroversial, any treatment which represents it as having the\nform of a deductively valid argument will also be controversial.\nWhether the \u2018core\u2019 of an argument is represented formally or\nsemantically,theidentificationofthatcoredependsonoursense\nofhowtheargumentissupposedtowork,ourpreanalyticbeliefs\nas to whether it does work,\nand related philosophical judgments. Thus, logical perception\nis not a mechanical matter. Furthermore, when we isolate the\ninferencestructureofanargument,itwillnotalwaysbeaformal\nstructure, not in any conventional sense of \u2018formal\u2019 at least. As\nthe examples from Leach and Cavell illustrate, logical analogies\nmay reveal structures relating terms that are not logical terms\nandthatholdlittlepromiseascentraltermsforaformalsystem.\nShould we construct formal systems to articulate and \u2018make\nprecise\u2019 the nonformal judgments that logical analogies enable\nus to make? Or can we rest content with concrete evidence of\ntheinadequacy ofmaterial inferences? This isthesame question\nthat arises when we consider the frequent claim that informal\nfallacies will not be properly understood until they are given a\nformal analysis.\n3.Prospects for Formalizing Informal Fallacies\nFinocchiaro contends that \u2018there are probably no common\nerrors in reasoning\u2019, meaning that there is no sense of \u2018the same\nerror\u2019 that allows the same error to occur frequently. Lambert\nand Ulrich, in a recent text, say that for informal fallacies \u2018even\nwhenonelearnstorecognizeallegedexamplesofthefallacies,it\nis difficult to see what common factor makes them all instances\nof the same fallacy.\u20192l Thus we see a concern for what different\ninstances of the same informal fallacy have in common.\nItappearthatthereisadilemmaherefortheinformalfallacies\napproach. If two different arguments share a feature, F, which\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 329 characterizes the reasoning in both, then isn\u2019t F (as shared) a\nformal feature? If that were the case, the analysis of informal\nfallacies as informal would be mistaken in principle. We have\nalready seen, however, that the logical core of an argument,\nthough necessarily general, is not necessarily formal. Would\nformalization be useful at this point?\nTo consider this question in the concrete, let us look at two\nargumentswhichmightbesaidtoexemplifytheinformalfallacy\nof\u2018twowrongs\u2019.ThefirstwasusedbyaprofessorinFrancewho\nsought to defend philosophy programs against the accusation\nthat they were not turning out competent graduates. He said:\nOurdegreeisnotrecognized,butwehavemorestudentsthanever.They\ncome because they think they might learn something. Sure, there are\nidiots. And I have given credits to them. There are bigger idiots in the\ngovernment. Is it up to me to be more rigorous than the electorate?22\nHere we have a defense of the practices of philosophers on the\ngrounds that the electorate has selected idiots to serve in the\ngovernment. Granting that we commonly regard it as\nundesirable for \u2018idiots\u2019 to serve a crucial public role, and that\nthe philosopher\u2019s degree has been deemed inadequate, it appears\nthat this author is defending what seems inadequate (standards\namong philosophy professors in France) by appealing to\nsomethingelsethatisaccepted(idiotsingovernment),butshould\nnot be.\nThe second argument concerns the Canadian seal hunt, and is\ntaken from a letter to the editor.\nI am a Newfoundlander, and I cannot help but feel some animosity\ntoward those people who approach the seal hunt issue from a purely\nemotional stance. Surely this is not the way they look in their butcher\u2019s\nfreezer, when they are looking for pork chops. Yet the slaughtering\nmethod approved by the Department of Health officials for swine is\nhideous, and nowhere near as humane as the dispatching of a young\nseal.23\n330TRUDYGOVIER In this passage the writer implicitly defends the seal hunt by\npointing out that worse methods of slaughtering animals are\ncondoned.Hemakesitclearthathethinkstheseworsemethods\nare wrong (\u2018hideous\u2019), and infers that there can be no rational\nbasisforoppositiontothesealhunt(opponentsapproachitfrom\na \u2018purely emotional stance\u2019). One wrong is accepted, so another\ncomparable one should not be criticized.\nFor convenient reference, let us call the first argument the\nFrench argument and the second one the Newfoundland\nargument. These arguments have many similarities and\ndifferences.24 So far as their reasoning is concerned, they have\nsomething in common. The following statement characterizes\nthe reasoning in both:\nW: From the existence and tacit acceptance of one wrong, it is inferred\nthat another comparable wrong should not be criticized.\nIn the French argument, the inference is from the electorate\u2019s\ncondoning incompetence in the government to the implicit\nconclusionthatattacksonstandardsinphilosophyprogramsare\ninappropriate. In the Newfoundland argument, it is from the\ncondoning of hideous slaughter methods for pigs to the implicit\nconclusion that the slaughter of seals should not be criticized.\nW describes the logical core of both arguments. If the inference\ndescribed in W is a mistake, then both arguments embody this\nmistake. If it is a common mistake in reasoning, then both\narguments commit it. If the fallacy is informal, there is no\nmystery as to how it is possible that two cases of \u2018the same\u2019\ninformalfallacycanhavesomethingincommon.Whattheyhave\nin common is (among other things) that W characterizes both.\nAt this point the question is whether the fallacy is informal.\nIt is commonly regarded as such, to be sure. In specifying W,\nwe use some words conventionally identified as logical words:\n\u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, \u2018not\u2019, and so on. But clearly it is not on these terms\nthat the inference depends. The thrust of the argument is from\nthe acceptance of one wrong to the illegitimacy of criticizing\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 331 anothercomparablewrong.Theproblemwithsuchargumentsis\nwithrelevance,therelevanceoftheacceptanceofthefirstwrong\nto the acceptability of the second one. The relevance problem\narises because the acceptance of one wrong thing seems to have\nno bearing on the legitimacy of criticizing a distinct thing. To\nshow that it is inappropriate to criticize some action, we have\ntoshowsomething specificallyabout either that action (that itis\nright)orthatcriticism(thatitwillbecounterproductive,thatitis\nhypocritical, thatitisill-founded\u2026).Wemightargueeffectively\nby analogy if we compared the case with another, obviously\nsimilar, in which the action was right or the criticism of the\naction misguided. (If A is permissible and B is relevantly similar\nto A, then B is permissible. Or, if it would be inappropriate\nto criticize A and B is relevantly similar to A, it would be\ninappropriate to criticize B.) However, as described in W,\nanalogyreasoningismisused.Ifthecitedwrongactioniswrong\nand the action under consideration is relevantly similar to the\ncited action, this shows that the action under consideration is\nwrong \u2013 a conclusion that runs contrary to the aim of the\narguments.\nThe mistake described in W does not seem to be a formal\nmistake.Relevanceisanonformalmatter;wehavetojudgewhat\nis relevant and not relevant in order to formalize. There are no\nformalrulesfortheproperuseofanalogies.Ifthemistakeisone\nofrelevanceandimproperuseofanalogy,thefallacyisinformal.\nHowever, it is trivially possible to formalize W, and it may be\nonthebasisofthisthatmanypeopleregardthestatusofinformal\nfallaciesasinformalasonethatistemporary.Toformallyexpress\nW,wesimplymaketherequisitestipulations.Let\u2018x\u2019and\u2018y\u2019range\nover items for which moral appraisal and acceptance are\nappropriate. Givenallofthesedefinitions,wecannowrepresent\nthe inference described in W as being based on the following\nconditional statement:\nQuasiformalW:Forallxandforally,ifxiswrongandisaccepted\n332TRUDYGOVIER and y is purportedly wrong, then if x is tacitly accepted and x and y are\ncomparable actions, y should not be criticized.\nA significant anomaly here is that the pivotal terms that\nconstitutethecoreoftheargumentwillbepredicates,notlogical\noperators. With the constituent terms of the two wrongs\narguments \u2013 and with most logical analogies, where material\ninference is under scrutiny there is little that can be said about\nthe merits of the argument in formal terms.\nThereisasenseinwhichonecanrepresentanythingformally;\none can stipulate definitions and plug in logical symbols for the\nlogical words used. The real question is not whether W and\ncomparable substantive principles are in any sense formalizable,\nbut rather whether it is useful to formalize them.\nIf one could construct a formal system in which the key terms\nappeared in the axioms and rules, and if within that system, one\ncould prove that the inference described in W is an incorrect\ninference, then a formalization might be genuinely useful and\nrevealing. However, the \u2018if\u2019 here is a big one. The requisite terms\nwouldbeimpossibletodefinewiththeprecisionaformalsystem\nwould require. Several, and perhaps all, are essentially\ncontestableorhavevagueperimeters.Thismeansthatonecould\nnot state axioms that would correspond fully with extra-formal\njudgments of meaning and truth. Also, as noted above, one\ncannot really operate logically with the concepts, save through\nmore standard logical operators such as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018not\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, and so\non. The proposed \u2018system\u2019 would do little with its key terms,\nsave assert or deny the truth of conditional statements which\nwould most reasonably be interpreted as representing material\ninferences.\nIf one were to construct such a system and apply it in order\nto determine the logical merits of such arguments as the French\nargumentandtheNewfoundlandargument,itisvirtuallycertain\nthatkeyjudgmentswouldremainextra-formal.Forinstance,the\njudgmentthattwocasesare\u2018comparable\u2019willhavetobemade.25\nThe idea that the existence of one wrong is irrelevant to the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 333 criticism of another comparable wrong may well have to be put\ninto the system as an axiom. If it is, then the sense in which\nthen the system will be able to provide a justification for that\njudgmentandraiseitabovethelevelofintuition,willbetenuous.\nAcomplicatingfactoratthispointisthatmostformalsystems\nare systems of deductive logic. It will be appropriate to appraise\nsuch inferences as that in \u2018two wrongs\u2019 arguments using these\nsystems only if we have pre-formally judged that those\narguments are deductive. That is, we must have interpreted the\nlogical relations intended in the argument as being such that\nthey would work deductively or not at all. For many natural\narguments, such an interpretation is implausible. Thus, even\ngranted that a pertinent formal system could be constructed, its\napplicability would be in question.\nLeaving such speculations, we can say that both the French\nargument and the Newfoundland argument are grounded on a\nquestionable material inference, that described in W. To say that\nthey are thus grounded is to presume first that both arguments\nareintendedtocastindoubtthelegitimacyofcriticizingactions\nor policies by citing accepted wrongs; second, that the material\ninferenceineachisdescribablebyW;andthirdthatthatmaterial\ninferenceisincorrect.Quiteobviously,noformalsystemisgoing\nto handle the first two aspects; it is only the third that is in\nquestionhere.Oncewehaveisolatedtheinferenceanddescribed\nit as being of a general type, we approach the territory where\nlogicintheclassicalsensecouldhavesomethingtosay.Itisthere,\nif anywhere, that we expect formalization to be useful.\nThe problem is that the inference is material and substantive\nrather than logical. To defend the judgment that such an\ninference is incorrect, we will have to argue that the tacit\nacceptanceofsomethingbypeopledoesnotshowthatthatthing\nitself is right, much less that something else, however closely\nanalogous to it, is right. We will have to argue that consistency\nshould not be pushed to the point of demanding that existing\nevils be accepted because some evils are accepted. All of this\n334TRUDYGOVIER connects directly to topics in moral philosophy. We will rely\non principles that may be controversial; we will use terms that\nare hard to define with precision and are essentially contestable.\nOur explanation as to why the inference is mistaken, and why\n\u2018two wrongs\u2019 constitutes a fallacy will not be a completely\nstraightforwarddescriptiveonethatallcompetentobserverswill\naccept. Obviously, there will be normative components.\nThe same kind of point can be made for many other informal\nfallacies.Considerforinstance,theadhominem.Inanadhominem\nargument,aninferenceismadefromcharacteristicsofanarguer\nto the falsehood or implausibility of his claim or theory or the\nvalidity of his argument. Ad hominem arguments are considered\nto be fallacious because, in general, such a connection does not\nhold up. Typically, negative features of an arguer or his\nbackgroundorcircumstanceshavenobearingonthesubstantive\ntruth of his claims or on the merits of his arguments. However,\nthere are complicated exceptions. For example, the arguer\u2019s\ntheory or claim may be about himself and may be rendered\ninductively unlikely by some feature of his character or\nbackground. In addition, considerations of the credibility and\nexpertise of the arguer often bear on the acceptability of his\nclaims to audiences, especially when the audiences cannot judge\nthe claims independently for circumstantial reasons.26 What\ncounts as an allegation about an arguer, what counts as the\ncontent of his conclusion, theory, or argument, what counts as\nevidence for or against truth, what counts as for or against\nacceptability, how that is related to truth \u2013 all these matters are\nrelevant to a full and accurate account of ad hominem. Although\nsomeone\u2019s being a liar is irrelevant to the question of whether\nslaves built the Pyramids, his being a liar may be relevant to\nthe question of the acceptability, in some context, of his claim\nthat slaves built the Pyramids. To develop these ideas we will\nneed to make substantive epistemic judgments. Similar points\ncan be made about the misuse of authority and the argument\nfrom ignorance, and indeed about most other traditional\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 335 informal fallacies. One could, in principle, articulate all these\nnonformal judgments and contestable decisions in a formal\ntheory. However, much reasoning would go on outside that\ntheory and precious little within it. The theory might give an\nimpression of rigor, but serve little other purpose.\nThe absence of formal theory in such contexts produces in\nsome circles an intense desire for formality and precision. But\nfar from the potentially contentious nature of such accounts\nrevealing the need for formal theories of the informal fallacies,\nit constitutes a powerful reason against their development. This\nis because the development and use of formal theories tends to\nhide controversies rather than admit or resolve them. It buries\ncontroversial assumptions in definitions and rules. Key issues\ncome to be disguised by technical apparatus, and immune from\ncriticism as something that is simply part of the system.\nDebatable principles and decisions are not eliminated by the\ndevelopmentandapplicationofformalsystems.Theyaremerely\nrelocated, so that the uninitiated have more trouble identifying\nthem and the initiated are trained to forget about them. Formal\naccounts may give the impression that controversial questions\nhave been resolved and essentially contestable terms defined\nwith final precision. However, that impression would be\nmisleading. A formal system purporting to represent and\nrationalize judgments about the fallaciousness of \u2018 two wrongs\u2019,\nadhominem,inappropriateauthority,orstrawmanwouldnotbe\nmore precise than a nonformal account. It might appear more\nprecise, but it would be pseudo-precise, because the appearance\nof rigor would misrepresent the phenomena.\n4.On the Necessity and Limits of Rules\nLet us consider the following argument:\n1. Ifthereisanactivitythathumanbeingsdointelligentlythenthere\nis a rule or set of rules describing how that activity is done or\nshould be done.27\n336TRUDYGOVIER 2. If there is a rule describing how some activity is done or should be\ndone, then that rule can be articulated by someone \u2013 if not by the\nagent simultaneous with his engagement in the activity, then by\nthat agent at another time, or by someone else.28\n3. If a characterizing rule or set of rules can be articulated, then\nit can be formalized, at least in some relatively weak sense of\n\u2018formalized\u2019.29\n4. If a rule or set of rules can be weakly formalized, then at least in\nprinciple it is possible to set out a mechanical decision procedure\nfor the activity it describes.\nTherefore,\n5. Any activity that human beings do intelligently can, in principle,\nbe captured by a set of rules which set out a mechanical decision\nprocedure.\nOr, reason can be mechanized.\nThis argument, which seem to have wide appeal, contradicts\ntheresultsofprecedingsectionshere.Howarewetogetaround\nit?\nFirst, some clarification. We need to distinguish four types of\nrules. Which type is being referred to will matter very much for\nour appraisal of the argument.\nThe relevant types are:\na. Strict formal rules. These are rules which hold universally\nand can be applied by observing purely typographical\ncriteria. Such rules are found only in formal axiomatized\nsystems. To operate within those systems is to manipulate\nsymbols according to these rules. Example: Every\noccurrence of \u2018-\u2018 may be replaced by \u2019v\u2019.\nb. Strict material rules. These are rules that hold universally\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 337 but are not purely typographical. Example: \u2018Every living\nhuman being has a heart.\u2019\nc. General rules. These are rules which hold most of the time,\nbutwhichhavea\u2018ceterisparibus\u2018clause.Example:\u2018Weakened\npeoplewhohavenothadshotsagainstsmallpoxandwhoare\nexposed to smallpox will catch smallpox.\u201930\nd. Rules of thumb: A rule of thumb is a rough guideline for\naction, a kind of policy we may follow in a case where we\ndo not have the time or expertise to rely on rules of the\nother types. It lacks any theoretical rationale, or may (more\ntypically) be based on guesses or unanalyzed experience.\nExample:Prospectivetenantswhoareveryanxioustoshow\nyou references are not a good bet. To operate according to\naruleofthumbistobeentirelypreparedthatthingsshould\nnot go as the (rough) rule would indicate; we know the rule\nis at best a rough approximation.\nIf we look back at the argument introducing this section, and\naskhow\u2018rule\u2019isbeing used,wecanseethatitcannotbeinsense\n(a) or in sense (d). In sense (a) the first premise would be false.31\nIn sense (d), it would also be false, but for a different reason.\nThe rule of thumb would not fully characterize the intelligent\nactivityquaintelligent.Itisnotthissortofrulethatapersonwho\ninsists that intelligent activities must be subsumed under rules\nhas in mind. A rule of thumb allows too much to be haphazard\nand unexplained by the rule. The idea behind the argument,\nexpressed in the first premise, is precisely contrary to this. It\nis that what is done intelligently must be systematic, cannot be\nrandom, must be done for a reason, where that reason is general.\nWhat remains are (b) and (c). If the reference in the argument\nis to rules in sense (b) or a sense that allows for general rules,\nas well as strict formal and material rules, then premises (2), (3)\nand (4) would clearly be true. However, premise (1) is false if the\nonly admissible rules are formal rules. One is hard pressed even\n338TRUDYGOVIER tofindexceptionlessrulesoutsidethedomainofformalsystems.\nEven the counterparts of formal rules of logic have exceptions\nthat have to be ruled out by provisos and tacit conditions of\nunderstanding, when we take them to apply to ordinary speech\nand thought. (As when we explain why \u2018he\u2019s attractive, but he\u2019s\nnot\u2019, is not a contradiction and why \u2018boys will be boys\u2019 and\n\u2018business is business\u2019 are not tautologies.) It is well known that\nscientific laws give predictions for \u2018normal circumstances\u2019,\npredictions that hold \u2018other things being equal\u2019. Society\u2019s\nprescriptive laws can be couched in absolute terms and thought\nto apply without proviso, but such a conception cannot account\nfor actual legal judgment where unusual circumstances are often\ntakenintoaccount.Here,whetherwespeakofthejudgmentsthat\nareinfactmade,orofthosejudgmentsthatoughttobemade,the\npoint remains. (For example, even where one is strictly liable, as\ninthecaseofstorekeeperssellingadulteratedmilk,astorekeeper\nwho was bound and hypnotized and as a result persuaded to\nadulterate his milk would not be penalized in the normal way.)\nThus, to make premise (1) come out as true, we must be using\n\u2018rule\u2019 in sense (c), or in some further sense which allows that\nrules could be of type (a) or (b) or (c). The crucial point is that\nintelligentactivitypresumeseithergeneralrulesorstrictrules.It\nisnotenoughtoextendtherangefromstrictformalrulestostrict\nmaterial rules. We must move away from strict rules as a fixed\nrequirementofintelligentactivity.Thus,wemustunderstandthe\nfirst premise as follows:\n1. Ifthereisanactivitythathumanbeingsdointelligentlythen\nthere is a rule or set of rules such that those rules are either\nformal, material or general, or a combination of these, and\nsuch that those rules describe how that activity is done or\nshould be done.\nOn this understanding, premise (1) may be true.32\nHowever, we now have a flexible understanding of rules. This\nmore flexible understanding of what rules involve affects the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 339 truth of the other premises. A ceteris paribus rule can be used\nby a person with judgment, as he or she will have a sense for\nthose cases where things are not \u2018equal\u2019 and the rule does not\napply. But can a ceteris paribus rule be used mechanically? Can it\nbe weakly formalized? If we are to formally express the rule, we\ncannot just leave the ceteris paribus clause as it stands. We have\nto spell it out \u2013 state explicitly what other things might bear\non the situation and how. We must enumerate all the unusual\ncircumstancesthatwouldmaketheruleinapplicable.Thismakes\nthe argument break down. Spelling out all these conditions is\nsimply not possible, because the range, and subtle variations in\ncombinations of factors, are too great. There will always be\nevents and circumstances we have not predicted and could not\npredictinadvance,andfeaturesthatturnouttoberelevant,that\nwe would never have considered mentioning.\nThe problem is that any interpretation of rules and rule-\nfollowingwhichwillmakeitplausibletoseeallhumanintelligent\nactivityasrule-governedwillmakeitfalsethatsuchrulescanbe\nformalizedandprogrammed.Theargumentasstatedexploitsthe\nvagueness of \u2018rule\u2019 and seems persuasive only for this reason.\nThat there is a limit to rules has been shown many times and\nmanyways\u2013byCarroll,byKant,byWittgenstein,andbyGodel.\nTheir results are well-known but have not had the impact they\nshould have on attempts to mechanize reason.33 Let us review\nthe results. Kant, in the passage quoted earlier, argued that it is\none thing to have a rule and another to decide when to apply\nit. For instance, if your rule is that one will contradict himself\nwhenever he asserts and denies the same thing, and that one\nshould not contradict himself, you will have to decide whether\n\u2018it\u2019s raining and it\u2019s not\u2019 amounts to assertion and denial of the\nsame thing. The same sort of problem is well-known in\narithmetical contexts. Though one and one make two, one\nraindrop and another raindrop do not make two raindrops. As\noneauthorputit,\u2018numbersasrealitiesmisbehave.\u201934Thisdoesn\u2019t\nrefute arithmetic because we do not take raindrops and their\n340TRUDYGOVIER mingling to be the sort of phenomena to which the rule of\narithmetic apply.\nKant said that the proper application of rules required\n\u2018judgment\u2019 or \u2018mother wit\u2019, something he regarded as\nunteachable. He argued against further rules telling you how to\napply rules, on the grounds that this demand leads to an infinite\nregress of rules. Suppose that we had a rule telling us to apply\narithmeticaltruthsonlytodiscreteentities.Thiscouldbehelpful,\nbut we would have to know how to apply this rule. We would\nonly face the necessity of making another decision about\nraindrops: are they discrete entities? At some point we have to\ndecide whether the entities to which the rule might be applied\ndo or do not instantiate the categories used to express the rule.\nThose categories are couched in stable, universal terms, yet\nreality is particular, variable, and fluctuating. A new case may\ndiffer from others, and yet seem significantly similar. Does the\nrule apply? The matter requires judgment and intelligent\ndecision, not a mechanical metarule telling us how to apply the\nfirst rule.\nWhere Kant called for \u2018mother wit\u2019, Wittgenstein, seeing the\nsame problem, appealed to custom, form of life, and the training\nof others who will not respond in the way you want if you do\nnot go on in the appropriate way. \u2018Rules must come to an end\nsomewhere\u2019, he famously said. The Wittgensteinian terminus is\nour common culture in which people mutually coordinate to\ndelimit the possibilities. We live together in a way that permits\nthe application of arithmetic to apples and oranges, but not to\nraindrops or the union of ovum and sperm.\nCustomisnottheonlysuggestionforbottomingout,ofcourse.\nDouglasHofstadter,seekstoendtheregressinacommonneural\nstructure in human brains, saying:\nRulesgetusedandmessagesdogetunderstood.Howcome?\u2026Sincethey\nare physical entities, our brains run without being told how to run.35\nHowever we propose to end the regress of rules, it has to end\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 341 somehow. The limitation emphasized by Wittgenstein and by\nKant in the passage quoted is that rules do not tell you how to\napply themselves, and further rules cannot always do this, on\npain of regress.\nThis theme about the need for rules to end is not quite the\nsame limitation pointed out by Lewis Carroll in \u201cWhat Achilles\nSaid to the Tortoise\u201d. There, the stubborn Tortoise refuses to\nuse rules of deductive inference in the normal way. He wants\nevery rule he would use as a basis for inference written into his\nargument explicitly as another premise. Granting \u2018A and B\u2019, and\ngranting \u2018If A and B, then Z\u2019, is not enough to make the Tortoise\ninfer Z by modus ponens. To do so, he would have to use modus\nponens tacitly. He would have to use logic without saying what\nlogic tells him to do. This the stubborn beast refuses to do. He\nwill not put his trust in logic. Remarking that \u2018whatever logic\nis good enough to tell me is worth writing down\u2019, the Tortoise\ndemands an articulation of the requisite conditional. Meeting\nthisdemandresultsinanewargument withthepremises: \u2018A and\nB; if A and B, then Z;if A and B and if A and B then Z.then Z\u2019. Here\nagain, to infer Z, he would have to use a rule not stated within\nthe argument as a premise. The Tortoise demands that that rule\nbe made explicit, and generates a fourth argument. In the nature\nofthecase,theTortoisecannotbesatisfied.HewillneverinferZ\nfromAandB\u2013despitethefactthatAandBentailZ,andthathe\nrecognizes the logical truth that if A and B, then Z.\nThe Carroll Dialogue shows that even when the mind is\noperatingaccordingtoclearcutrules,suchrulescannotallbemade\nexplicit in the context of use. They can be made explicit in another\ncontext\u2013anobservercontext.Butwhenanobserverreasons,he\nhimself will necessarily reason according to some rules that are\nnot explicitly stated. These rules, in turn, can be made explicit\nin another context. There can be no one context in which all\nrules of reasoning are explicit at once. To draw an inference\nthat is in accordance with a rule of inference is in one sense to\nuse a rule of inference. But it cannot require stating that rule of\n342TRUDYGOVIER inference explicitly as a premise in one\u2019s reasoning. Contrary to\nthe Tortoise, there are necessarily some things logic \u2018tells you\u2019\nthat cannot be written down.\nAt this point, Carroll\u2019s dialogue offers intimations of Godel\u2019s\nresult, which states that for any formal system of interesting\ncomplexitythereisanecessaryincompleteness.Therearealways\nstatements expressible within the system and informally\nprovable to be true, yet not provable according to the strict\nformal rules of the system itself. This fact about the limits of\nformal rules cannot be eliminated by constructing stronger\nsystems, for such systems will only present the same kind of\nproblematahigherlevel.Newstatementsareconstructiblewith\nthe same property \u2013 informal provability in the face of formal\nintractability. Critics of fallacy analysis have urged that the\nnecessary incompleteness of any list of fallacies is a serious\nproblem. If this problem were devastating for fallacies, it would\nundermine positive proof theory as well.36\nKant and Wittgenstein showed how something other than\nexplicit rules is presumed by the application of rules. Godel\nshowed that in any given formal system of interesting richness,\ninformally derivable truths will exceed formally derivable ones.\nCarroll showed that in an argument, movement from premises\nto conclusion presumes the tacit acceptance of rules not, in that\ncontext, made explicit. Derivable truths will exceed formally\nderivable ones. Given these well-known results, the idea that\naspects of argumentation and its appraisal are not fully\nmechanical should not be surprising. These theoretical results\ncoincide beautifully with indications\nfrom concrete problems that arise in argument analysis and\nevaluation.\nThe ease with which such results are conveniently forgotten\nin our culture and the influence of the pre-Godelian idea that\nreasoning must be something bound by formal rules may be\ndue to scientistic bias. We feel such a perverse attraction for\nmechanistic and technologically fashionable models of human\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 343 intelligencethatweforgetwhatsomeofourmostprofoundand\nsubtle reasoners have shown us about reasoning itself.

Of course philosophers have no non-arbitrary way of\nlimiting this list of logical words. The \u2018and so on\u2019 clause is very\nimportant.

This point is pedagogically and philosophically significant.\nGiven an exemplar of an informal fallacy and asked to analyze\na number of passages, a person is often inclined to focus his\nor her attention on aspects of those passages that are similar\nto the exemplar. Varying the exemplar can highlight different\nresemblances and differences. This duck-rabbit sort of\nphenomenon partially explains why the same argument may be\nseen as exemplifying several different fallacies at once and is an\nimportant objection to teaching argument analysis by teaching\nfallacies (formal or informal). The reader\u2019s logical perception\nis distorted by his attempts to see the exemplar in the passage\nand his judgment is confused by the possibility of the passage\nexemplifying several \u2018different\u2019 mistakes at once.

Debates about disciplinary jurisdiction over\n\u2018critical thinking\u2019 persist as they did in the eighties, with psychology\nand neuroscience, English, rhetoric, sociology, and other disciplines\ncompeting with philosophy. Claiming the territories of formal and\ninformallogic,aswellasphilosophyofscience,philosophersseemtome\ntohavestrongerclaimsthandoinstructorsintheseotherareas.Perhaps\nthat stance reflects my disciplinary bias. Within philosophy, debates\nabout logic and critical thinking persist although with diminished\nintensity: some formalists continue to defend their turf.\nTo be sure, the concept of critical thinking is a contested one, that\nbeingonlyoneaspectcontributingtodebatesabouttheproperacademic\nlocation of critical thinking skills. How necessary is rigor? How much\neffort should be made to include debated social issues? How relevant (if\natall)isknowledgeaboutthebrain?Arethereideologicalpresumptions?\nIssues of discipline-specificity remain, with a general consensus that\nthere are both general standards for cogent argument and\nconsiderations specific to particular disciplines.\nOverthepastfewyears,numerouscoursesoncriticalthinking\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 349 have appeared in colleges, universities, and schools. These\ncourses have been inspired by the perception of educators that\nmany students do not have the ability to reach independent,\nreasoned, critical judgments about material they read or study.\nThat such abilities are desirable is not in question. There are,\nhowever, disputes about how, if at all, they can be developed or\ntaught.1\nVeryoften,criticalthinkingcoursesarecoursesininformalor\nformallogic.Tocultivatecriticalthinking,educatorshavebyand\nlarge taught argument analysis and evaluation. We think when\nweargue,andwethinkcriticallywhenweevaluateanargument;\nhence,teachingargumentativeskillswouldseemanaturalwayto\nteach critical thinking. And, indeed, texts on argument analysis\narewidelybilledas\u2018criticalthinking\u2019texts.Manypeopleteaching\ninformal logic use the expressions \u2018informal logic\u2019 and \u2018critical\nthinking\u2019 as virtual synonyms.2\nThere are also the dissenters from this analysis, most\nprominent among them, John McPeck.3 McPeck sees critical\nthinking as a kind of reflective scepticism. A person thinks\ncritically about a subject when he or she judiciously considers\nvariousclaimsandisnotdisposedtomerelyacceptwhatisheard\norreadatfacevalue.Whatmakesapersoncapableofdoingthis,\nMcPeck contends, is his knowledge of that particular subject. It\nis not his ability to manipulate the concepts and tools of formal\nand informal logic. It is not his knowledge of the nature of\ndefinitions, modus ponens, disjunction, induction, the logic of\nexplanations, the ad hominem fallacy, and so on. Rather, it is\nsubstantive knowledge, not general logical knowledge. For\ninstance, a person would be capable of critical thinking on the\ntopic of MX missile development only if he knew something\nabout nuclear strategy, and had mastered such concepts as \u2018first\nstrike\u2019, \u2018first use\u2019, \u2018vulnerability\u2019, and so on. Being trained in logic\n\u2013 whether broadly or narrowly construed \u2013 would be of little\nuse.McPeckcontendsthatlogicianshavegreatlyover-estimated\nthe role of general and logical considerations in the assessment\n350TRUDYGOVIER ofclaimsandthereasoningthatsupportsthem.Atthesametime\nthey have under-estimated the significance of information.\nMcPeck\u2019s analysis is both epistemological and pedagogical.\nEpistemologically,heoffersanaccountofappraising claimsand\narguments in which nonformal, non-general, substantive\nconsiderations are of paramount importance. His pedagogical\ncorollary is that separate courses oncritical thinking should not\nbeoffered.Hemaintainsthatsuchcourseswillofnecessitytreat\nexamples from an inadequately informed perspective, because\nthey will lack the substantive disciplinary base that is pertinent\nto the subject matter of these examples. For instance, if the\ninstructor has students analyze an example of analogical\nreasoning where the Viet Nam situation is used as a model for\npolicy regarding El Salvador, he will typically have little but his\nown background knowledge or the prejudices of the day to call\non when it comes to the crucial question as to whether the two\nsituations are or are not relevantly similar. He is unlikely to\nknow enough historical and political facts to really judge the\nstrength of the inductive analogy. Where non-empirical issues\nsuch as the morality of intervention or the importance of\npreserving \u2018free enterprise\u2019 bear on the argument, there is still\nlittle help from informal logic, because these topics require\nsubstantive analysis from the perspective of moral and political\ntheory. The critical thinking instructor who is committed to\ntreating \u2018real-life\u2019 examples but must, in the context of his\nclassroom, do so without simultaneously teaching the substance\nof history, ethics, or any other subject, will be left with a thin\nand perhaps misleading analysis. He can tell his students that if\nVietNamandElSalvadorarerelevantlysimilar,thentheanalogy\nfrom American experience in Viet Nam to non-intervention in\nEl Salvador is a good one, and if they are not, it isn\u2019t. The\nsituation recalls John Wisdom\u2019s lament that the whole of logic\nmaybestatedintheline:\u2018Hewillbuyyoutheyakorelsehewill\nnot; I cannot be positive which.\u20194\nMcPeckbelievesthatcriticalthinkingcoursescannotperform\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 351 the important function of cultivating reflective scepticism in\nstudents. He does allow that critical thinking should be\ndeveloped in the classroom, and his recommendation is for\nstandard subjects, especially liberal arts and science subjects, to\nbetaughtinacriticalandepistemicallysensitiveway.Thiswould\nmean, probably, that history would be taught with an emphasis\non questions about the reliability of testimony, the credibility of\nvarious sources, the feasibility of analogical reasoning from one\nsituation to another, the necessity or non-necessity of laws in\nhistoricalexplanation,andotherepistemicallysignificanttopics.\nThe same would be true of biology, literature, physics,\npsychology, philosophy, and all the other subjects. Students\ntaught in this way would be encouraged to think critically in\na context where they had sufficient information to do so, and\ninstructors could develop critical thinking skills without being\nrestrictedtothingeneralities.McPeck\u2019sviewisthatphilosophers\ndo not have as much to say as they think about arguments in\nother people\u2019s subjects, and they have no monopoly either on\nthe theory or the practice of critical thinking. Informed critical\nthinking should be a significant element of every academic\nsubject.\nMcPeck\u2019s pedagogical recommendations are based on his\nepistemological theory about what goes into the critical\nappraisal of a claim or an argument in support of a claim. There\nare clearly important reminders in his account. When we\ntheorize about arguments from the perspective either of formal\nor of informal logic, we are generalizing. This makes us\nconcentrateonthosefeaturesofarguments whichareuniversal,\nuniversal within a subclass, or at least relatively common.\nContent-specific and context-specific aspects are apt to receive\nlittle attention, except insofar as they are amenable to\ngeneralization. This focus of attention does mean that in some\ncases,logicandthetheoryofargumentwillhavelittletoofferto\nresolve key questions.5\n352TRUDYGOVIER Consider, for example, an argument along the following lines,\nabout the MX missile.\n1. The MX missile will intimidate the Russians and make nuclear\nwar less likely.\n2. Building the MX missile is possible, given current economics and\ntechnology.\n3. Reducing the risk of nuclear war is of paramount importance.\nTherefore,\n4. The MX missile should be built.\nMuchwilldependhereonthefirstpremise.Inthecaseofthis\nargument,formalandinformallogic,andthetheoryofargument\ncan tell us little; we have to decide whether to accept this\npremise. Unless the premise itself contains some logical or\ngeneral error (inconsistency, loaded terms, or some comparable\nflaw), this decision will be based on our judgment about\nsubstantiveissues.Tomakeit,wehavetoknowsomethingabout\nwhat the missile is, how it will fit into the existing nuclear\nweapons systems, what intimidates Russians, and the relation\nbetween intimidating Russians and reducing the risk of nuclear\nwar.Insuchacasethereisnoshortcutthroughlogictoaverdict\non the argument. Insofar as this would be McPeck\u2019s point, he\nwould be absolutely right.\nNow in an obvious sense, neither formal nor informal\nlogicians have ever denied this kind of point. No one has ever\nsaid that arguments can be evaluated without evaluating their\npremises, and no one has ever said that premises can be\nevaluated without subject-specific information. At one level,\nthen,McPeckisremindingusofatruism.Therearecaseswhere\nthe potential for purely logical confusion about an argument is\nminimal and virtually everything we need comes from outside\nlogic. In such cases, the critical thinking instructor or logic\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 353 instructor will have to direct students to either remain agnostic\nabout the merits of the argument, due to premise content, or\nseek out enough information to make an informed judgment\naboutthepremises.McPeckregardssuchcasesasverycommon,\nand cases where the merits of the argument depend on general\nlogical points as quite rare.\nInfact,McPeck\u2019saccountmakesdiscipline-specificknowledge\nrelevant to the appraisal of reasoning as well as to the appraisal\nof premises, because he insists that standards of reasoning are\nthemselves contextually defined within the various disciplines.6\nThis view of reasoning is unorthodox and has been criticized\nelsewhere. However, the pertinence of substantive knowledge\nto premise assessment and interpretation will itself generate\nMcPeck\u2019s conclusion.\nTheMXmissileexampleisnotonethatMcPeckhimselfused,\nbut it is, prima facie, a convincing one to illustrate his theory.\nNuclear strategy and the psychology of nations are technical\nand confusing topics. It will be no easy matter to determine\njust whether the MX missile reduces or increases the risk of\nnuclear war. There are technical questions, strategic questions,\nand psychological-political questions. Students who seek\n\u2018information\u2019 to evaluate the premise will face a hard task. They\nwill find technical terms, alternative sets of statistics about the\nnuclear balance of power, different theories about Russian\nsociety, appeals to Russian history using the same facts to argue\ncompetingconclusions,applicationsoftechnicaldecisiontheory\nin contexts where precise predictions are impossible, and many\nother epistemic delights. Thus, much thought will be required\nin order to reach a judgment on the crucial premise. Critical\nthinking itself will not provide this knowledge.\nAnaspectofthiskindofsituationthatMcPeckunderestimates\nis that argument analysis and other aspects of critical thinking\nare often needed in order to obtain information. Faced with\none set of statistics about the Russian forces from the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense, another from the Stockholm\n354TRUDYGOVIER International Peace Research Institute, and a third from the\nUnited Nations, one will have to ask about the credibility of\nthese sources, in the context, and the relevance of statistical\ndifferencestothespecificissueoftheMX.Theanswerstothese\nquestionsinturnwillrequiresomesubstantiveinformation,but\nthe structure and bearing on this information on them is a\ngeneralmatteronwhichthevarietyoftopicstreatedininformal\nlogic courses will have a bearing.\nMcPeck issues a plea for information in critical thinking. But\nthe term \u2018information\u2019 is rather misleading in this context.7 It\nsuggest that there are straightforward facts, perhaps statistics,\nthat we can look up and that will resolve the relevant questions.\nSome techniques taught in critical thinking or informal logic\ncourses are pertinent when students try to find needed\n\u2018information\u2019, as they surely will be in this case. Even the \u2018thin\u2019\nadvicetoreflectonrelevantdifferenceswhenanalogiesareused\nmay turn out to be of use. When we find predictions about\nthe likely responses of nation states, we almost always find them\nto be based on assumptions about the psychology of individual\nagents.Compositionanddivisionissuesarisehere.(Threatswill\nonlymakeaparanoidbehavemoreirrationallysaysanti-nuclear\nadvocate Helen Caldicott; the only way to reform a person is\nto make him fearful of the consequences of bad behavior, say\nadvocates of military build-up. On both sides the claims are\nthen applied to nation states.) Being aware of the fallacies of\ncomposition and division, and of issues regarding the logical\nevaluation of analogies, will be highly relevant to the evaluation\nof competing sets of \u2018information.\u2019\nClearly, McPeck is correct in saying that for some arguments,\nthe decisive evaluation issue is not logical, even when \u2018logic\u2019 is\nunderstood quite broadly. Even if we do not take his position\nthat standards of reasoning are discipline-specific, it is clearly\ntrue that the substantive information needed to evaluate\npremises often comes from outside formal and informal logic.\nFurthermore \u2013 a point McPeck does not explicitly mention \u2013\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 355 such substantive information may also be needed in order to\ncorrectly interpret the argument. The other side of the story,\nthough, is that for some arguments and claims, the decisive\nevaluationissueislogical.Inresponsetothestoryofthecritical\nthinking instructor left with a thin analysis of a substantive and\nrich example we can tell alternative stories about supposedly\nwell-informed experts whose claims depend on elementary\nflawsinreasoning.Aprominentbiologistappearedontelevision\nto say that there would almost certainly be no important\nenvironmental effects if potato crops were exposed to an\nespeciallydeveloped,geneticallyalteredbacteriumwhichwould\nprevent freezing. His reason was that since the genetic change\nin the bacterium was small, any effects of the change would\nsimilarly be small. In this case, the man\u2019s expertise and\nprominence did not prevent him from the elementary error of\ninferringthesmallnessofaneffectfromthesmallnessofacause.\nStories about experts who reason poorly are as easy to tell\nas those of logicians and philosophers who lack information.8\nMcPeck might insist that even in these examples the causal and\nanalogicalerrorsaresubstantive,notformal.Sureenough,what\nisneededtoseetheseerrorsisnotformallogic,becausetheerror\ninvolves non-deductive reasoning. This does not mean, though,\nthat no training in logic is relevant to the detection of the error.\nWhat is relevant here is something quite elementary and yet\nelusive to many not encouraged to think about reasoning,\nargumentation,andthejustificationofclaims.Itisthesensethat\nreasoningisgoingon,thatthereisaninferencemadefromsome\npropositions to others, and that this inference can be critically\nscrutinized. Virtually anyone who detected the inference from\n\u2018the cause is small\u2019 to \u2018the effect is small\u2019 would be able to see it\nas silly. Small factors can have big effects. People who consider\nthemselves experts may focus so much on substance that they\nignore the dependence of some substantive claims on others.\nYet a careful consideration of their discourse will reveal such\ndependence and may show significant gaps in reasoning.\n356TRUDYGOVIER Is it better to reason well, using accurate and clear language,\napt analogies, an acute sense of what counts as a good\nexplanation, and the battery of techniques cultivated by formal\nandinformallogicians,butstartingfromunacceptablepremises?\nOr is it better to begin from accurate and substantively rich\npremises, but reason poorly, failing to recognize the issues\ndisguised by emotionally loaded language, accepting facile\nexplanations without recognizing the existence of alternatives,\nrelying on ad hominems that are current in the \u2018discipline\u2019, and\ndotting one\u2019s account with appeals to the latest disciplinary\nauthorities?Obviously,thequestionastowhichofthesestylesis\nbetterorworseisanabsurdone.Neitheralternativeisdesirable;\nboth will lead to serious error. The first style will generate\ngarbage from garbage. The second will generate garbage from\nnon-garbage. So far as adequate beliefs are concerned, the\ndifference between them is not very interesting. Epistemology\nand pedagogy have to recognize the importance both of\nsubstance and of reason. Reasoning without substantive content\nis empty, but substance without reasoned direction is blind.\nGiventhatsomeerrorsstemfromfaultyreasoningandothers\nfrom substantive misinformation, we might want to determine\nwhichofthesetwosourcesisthemostcommonsourceoferror.\nOn this issue, McPeck is committed to the view that it is\nsubstantive defects that matter most.9\nEven the \u2018everyday problems\u2019 closer to home, such as the rights of\nminorities, affirmative action, nuclear power plants, taxproposals such\nas\u2018Proposition13\u2019,productsafetyandthelikerequirebeinginpossession\nof, and comprehending, large amounts of complex information. There\nis simply no shortcut around this brute fact about the complexities of\nwhataremisleadinglycalled\u2018everydayproblems\u2019.Moreover,ninety-eight\npercent of our mistakes (note my dazzling statistics again!) in rational\njudgmentoriginateinthisinformationaldomain:eitherbecausewedon\u2019t\nhave enough of it, or our sources are unreliable, or just as often as not\nbecause we do not understand the empirical foundations and therefore\nthe meaning of the information we do have.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 357 SuchclaimshavebeendisputedbyRobertEnnis,whodefends\nthe pedagogy and epistemology of formal and informal logic as\nmeans to critical thinking. Ennis points out that such logical\nconsiderationsascredibility,authority,syllogisticreasoning,and\ncriteria for explanations apply to widely differing subject\nmatters. In all cases of causal reasoning, we cannot\nstraightforwardly infer a cause from a correlation, because\nalternative explanations of the correlation need to be ruled out.\nThis will always mean that causal inference is less than\nwatertight, for the number of alternative explanations is always,\nin principle, indefinitely large, and there is always, therefore, a\ndependence on background knowledge. Whenever a reliance is\nmade on the testimony or authority of a person, that person\u2019s\ninterests and moral character will be relevant. And so on; many\ncomparable points can be made. In fact, McPeck does not really\ndisagreewithsuchpointsasthese.Heseems,rather,tothinkthat\nthesecommonelementsareeasilymasteredandtypicallyoflittle\nimportanceinthediagnosisoferrororthequestfortruth.Ennis\nsuggests that whether errors result more from substantive lack\nof information or misinformation or from faults in reasoning,\ndefinition, and general logical operations is an empirical\nquestion.10\nAt some level this is clearly true. However, the question is\nempiricalinacomplicatedway.Toresolveit,wewouldfirsthave\ntofindasampleoferrorsthatwouldconstitute arepresentative\nsample of human error. We would have to find out the beliefs\nunderlyingtheerrorandthereasoningthatledtotheerroneous\njudgment. That would be difficult. Even when this underlying\nreasoning was discovered, diagnosing the causes of the error\nwould present further difficulties. What seemed to be\nsubstantive errors might themselves be the result of prior\nreasoning errors; what seemed reasoning errors might be the\nresult of faulty substantive assumptions or of the adoption of a\nmodel of reasoning different from that used by the researcher.\nA large number of epistemic and interpretive norms would be\n358TRUDYGOVIER presupposed in the construction of such experimental work.11\nTo say that it would be empirical is slightly misleading, for the\nbackground interpretive, sampling, and logical assumptions\nwould be highly philosophical. In fact, the body of such\nassumptions would be very controversial, considered all\ntogether.Anyevenmoderatelysurprisingresultwouldbesureto\nleadtoourlookingbacktoquestionsomeofthoseassumptions.\nThe issue is at best quasi-empirical.12\nIn any event, perhaps it does not matter so very much.\nAccurate beliefs clearly require both good evidence and good\nreasoning. Common experience, logical tradition, and any\nstraightforward analysis of argumentative discourse all indicate\nthat people make mistakes sometimes due to inadequate\ninformation, sometimes due to inadequate reasoning, and\nsometimes due to a complicated mixture of these. There is little\npoint, epistemically, in asking which sort of error is more\ncommon, in general, and there is no real likelihood of getting\na firm empirical answer to that question using social scientific\nmethods.\nAsforthepedagogicalissue,therearemanycoursesthatteach\nsubstance and relatively few that focus on reasoning or critical\nthinking. If substantive courses were critically focused in the\nways McPeck suggests, some of the more elementary course\ndiscussion of argument, justification, definition, explanation,\nand related topics which we now seem to need in colleges,\nschools, and universities would not be necessary. No concerned\nand educated person would dispute McPeck\u2019s recommendation\nthat the whole spectrum of academic subjects offer scope for\ncritical analysis, and that people would be better educated if\ninstructors were willing to focus on this and cultivate\nindependent judgment in their students. This commendable\nreform has not yet occurred, however. In the present situation,\nthere is room for courses that focus particularly on argument,\ndefinition, the logic of argument and explanation, and related\ntopics. Even in a vastly improved situation, there would still be\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 359 scope for such courses, although they could usefully be more\nadvanced and interesting than some are now.\nA major reason for having courses on critical thinking is the\ntension between substantive and methodological focus. For\ninstance,inacourseonHume\u2019sphilosophy,onemightstudyhis\nessay on miracles. In the course of doing so, one may consider\nthegeneralsubjectofcredibilityandthestrengthofevidencefor\ntestimony. The discussion relates to issues that are also raised\nby ad hominem and authority arguments. However, in a course\nspecificallyfocusedonHume,thelattercannotbeamajortopic,\norelseotheraspectsofHume\u2019sphilosophywillbeneglected.On\nthe other hand, a course on informal logic might well include a\nstudyofHume\u2019sessayonmiraclesduringthecourseofworkon\ncredibility.ThefocusherewouldnotbeonHume\u2019sepistemology\nand philosophy of religion, but rather on general epistemic\nissuesaboutourrelianceonotherpersonsforknowledge.Given\nthat resources in any single course are finite, and that subject\nmatter has to be delineated in a coherent and responsible way,\nseparate courses in which the primary focus is on topics from\nlogic and informal logic seem entirely appropriate.\nMcPeck\u2019s account is useful in reminding us that courses on\ncritical thinking and argument analysis should not claim too\nmuch. We have to accept the need for substantive information\nandjudgmentasrelevantbothtotheinterpretationofdiscourse\nand to the evaluation of premises. Neither formal logic, nor\ninformal logic, nor the theory of argument provide this. None,\ntherefore, offer everything we need to be critical thinkers. All\noffersomethingweneedandareworthpursuingforthatreason.\nIn critical thinking courses oriented toward argument\nconstruction and appraisal, we can teach some things needed to\nevaluate arguments on any subject. We can also explore many\nfurther topics needed to evaluate arguments. But we cannot\nteach everything needed to evaluate every argument.13\nArgument analysis is not merely a matter of appraising for\ndeductive validity, as McPeck sometimes implies.14 It\n360TRUDYGOVIER incorporates the proper interpretation and classification of\narguments, the application of the appropriate standard\n(inductive, deductive, conductive, analogy, or other), an\nevaluation of the premises, and much else. McPeck sometimes\nwrites as though assessments of deductive validity are all that\nlogiciansandphilosopherscanprovide.That\u2019snotcorrect.With\nanenrichedaccountofwhatargumentappraisalinvolves,wecan\ngo a long way to answering his objections.\nIt is surely true that formal logic cannot provide all that is\nnecessary for the appraisal of substantive argumentation.\nDespitetheirgreaterbreadth,neithercaninformallogicandthe\ntheory of argument. Even if we could reduce critical thinking\nto argument evaluation, it would be incorrect to see it as\nencompassed by informal logic, because informal logic does not\ninclude the substantive knowledge that is very often needed to\nappraise premises. At the very least, argument analysis must\nencompass premise evaluation, and typically premise evaluation\nwillrequireextra-logicalknowledge.Furthermore,despitesome\nmisleading advertising, no one really denies this conclusion.15\nEven if we were to grant that critical thinking amounts to\nconstructing and/or appraising arguments, we could not claim\nthat philosophical courses in logic and argument analysis give\neverything that we need for critical thinking. They cannot give\nus everything we need for argument analysis itself, because that\nrequiressubstantiveinformation.Suchcoursesomitsubstantive\ninformation assuch,buttheydoprovidemuchthatisneeded to\nassess claims put forward as providing substantive information.\nIt might seem that argument analysis, when fully understood,\ndoes constitute critical thinking. A number of people do, in\neffect, identify critical thinking with argument analysis. There\nseemstobesomethingnaturalaboutthis.Consider,forinstance,\nMcPeck\u2019s shorter definition of critical thinking as reflective\nscepticism. Suppose that a person is reflectively sceptical about\nsome claim, theory, or argument. If he is reflectively sceptical\nabout an argument, then that is just to say that he is engaging in\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 361 argumentanalysis;hehaslocatedsomepointatwhichhethinks\nthe argument goes wrong. If he is reflectively sceptical about\na claim, he has some reasons to think the claim might not be\ntrue. That is to say that he has his own argument that he has\nconstructed, against the claim, and he is considering the merits\nofhisownargument.Ifheisreflectivelyscepticalaboutatheory,\nhe has data that he thinks the theory cannot accommodate; that\nis to say, he has an argument from the existence of this data\nto the improbability of the theory\u2019s being true. It might seem,\naccordingly, that critical thinking has to be about arguing and\nevaluatingargumentsandcannotbeaboutanythingelse,because\nwheneverwethinkcriticallyweare,explicitlyortacitly,arguing\nor criticizing arguments.\nThis view was once stated by J.A.Blair.\nA problematic claim worthy of acceptance is made so by evidence or\nother sorts of consideration which show it is plausible, that objections\nto it may be rejected, and thatalternatives are less plausible. In short,\n(problematic)claimsworthyofassentarethosewhicharesupportedby\ngoodarguments.Argumentisthetoolofreasonedcriticalappraisal\u2013or\nour own and others\u2019 claims and actions \u2013 and the vehicle of reasoned\nadvocacy of claims and conduct. Good reasons mean good arguments;\ngood reasoning means good argumentation.16\nA critical thinker judges for himself or herself in a probing\nreflective way. Critical thinking, then, involves reflection,\ndeliberation, respect for the critical judgment of others, and the\navoidanceofmanipulativenonrationaltechniquesofpersuasion.\nTeaching the identification, understanding, evaluation, and\nconstructionofargumentsisabasicandobviouswaytocultivate\ncriticalthinking.Indeed,providedwearehappywiththenotion\nof tacit arguings-to-oneself, we may even wish to say that\nthinkingcriticallyaboutsomethingentailsarguingorevaluating\nan argument about it. To improve critical thinking, we offer\ncourses on the construction and analysis of arguments.\nNevertheless, there is something peculiar about the full\nidentification of critical thinking with argument analysis. There\n362TRUDYGOVIER are two underlying reasons for this, one having to do with the\nless fully articulated nature of critical thinking, the other\nstemming from the typically atomistic and finite nature of\nargumentanalysis.RichardPaulemphasizedthissecondpoint.17\nConsider first that thinking is more chaotic, less directed, and\nless fully articulated than arguing or evaluating arguments.\nThinking, whether critical or creative, is very often private and\nsubjective.\nArgument may result from critical thinking, but need not.\nArgument construction and analysis are nearly always in the\npublic domain, since a major purpose of argumentation is the\nrational persuasion of others. Theorists have long distinguished\nreasoning from arguing on grounds similar to these.18 We often\nreason without arguing \u2013 following through possible\nconsequences of a line of action, assessing pros and cons, trying\nto determine consistency, and so on. Similarly, we often think \u2013\nconstructively, creatively, or critically \u2013 without arguing. Since\ncritical thinking necessarilyinvolves thought and reflection, but\ndoes not necessarily involve the articulation of an argument,\ncritical thinking should not be identified with argument.\nThinking includes wondering, wishing, deliberating,\nquestioning, contemplating, synthesizing, comparing,\nsimplifying, hypothesizing, and much else. It may, but need not,\ninvolve arguing.\nOf course, not all thinking is critical thinking. Critical\nthinking is thinking about another product of thought (an\nargument, claim, theory, definition, hypothesis, question,\ncreativeproductorproblem)inaspecialscepticallydeliberative,\nevaluative way. A recent author put it this way:\nCritical thinking involves a reflective attitude. As a critical thinker,\none does not just let situations and claims slip by. Rather, one focuses\nupon and assesses beliefs, claims, events, discoveries, etc. This focusing\nisnotadventitious,butresultsfromaconsciousdecisiontothinkabout\northinkthroughthethingsoneencounters,andtodevelophabitswhich\npromote the implementation of such a decision.19\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 363 In an exchange in Teaching Philosophy, the following account\nappeared:\nOn those occasions when a mental act is called into question, there is\ntypicallyaneedforsomebasisbeyondtheactitselfforjudgingit.Here\nis where critical thinking comes to life: critical thought consists of the\nevaluation of mental acts, and concern about critical thinking involves\nidentifying proper basis for evaluation and means for doing so.20\nBut just as reasoning is not the same as the argument it may\nproduce,socriticalthinkingisnotthesameastheanalysisitmay\nproduce.\nIn fact, critical thinking is not strictly speaking a necessary\ncondition of good constructive argumentation. It is, of course,\nprudent to apply some critical thinking to the products of our\nconstructive and creative thinking. Reflecting may reveal errors\norinauspiciousaspectsofpresentation,anditisworthchecking.\nArgument construction always requires thinking \u2013 constructive\nandcreativethinking\u2013butisnotalwaysaccompaniedbycritical\nthinking.\nArgument evaluation, on the other hand, will always require\ncritical thinking. This makes it understandable that courses\ndevoted to argument analysis and evaluation should bill\nthemselves as courses on critical thinking. To analyze an\nargument, we must reflect critically on the meaning of the\ndiscourse in which it is presented and the context in which it\nappears; we must reflect critically on the structure of that\ndiscourse; we must critically determine whether the premises\nare acceptable, using pertinent substantive information; and we\nmust critically scrutinize the reasoning used. Doing argument\nanalysiswillsurelymeandoingconsiderable critical thinking. It\nwouldbesurprisingiftheactivitydidnotcultivatehabitscentral\nto critical thinking, such as not taking authorities\u2019 statements\nfor granted, looking for good reasons for accepting beliefs,\nidentifying and examining your own assumptions and generally\nbeing on the alert at every stage. There is no dishonesty in\n364TRUDYGOVIER representing courses on argument analysis and evaluation as\ncoursesthatcultivateoneimportantdimensionofafundamental\nkind of critical thinking.21 Because substantive information is\nalso needed for argument evaluation, general logical\nconsiderations, whether formal or informal, are not sufficient\nfor good critical thinking, and no effort to publicize critical\nthinking should imply that they are.\nThe product of critical thinking is often argument or\nargument analysis. Such products virtually always require the\nprocess of critical thinking. However, this approach makes too\nlittle of the fact that critical thinking is a process, typically\ninterior,distinguishable fromthisproduct.Furthermore,except\ninanattenuatedsense,theanalysisofanargumentisnotthesole\nproductofcriticalthinking.Thereareotherimportantproducts\ntoo.\nSomeoftheseotherproductsrequirekindsofcriticalthinking\nthat are not greatly demanded by the process of argument\nanalysis. For instance, writing a piece on nineteenth century\nCanadiansocialhistorywouldrequirecriticalthinkinginwhich\na capacity for synthesis was important. A person would have to\nput together various accounts of the same event, and accounts\nof different events and also, themes from different disciplines.\nTo do this would require critical thinking, but a kind of critical\nthinking that would not be likely to be emphasized in an\ninformal logic course. This example is still within the articulate,\nintellectual domain. The point becomes still more obvious if\nwe consider what kinds of critical thinking might be needed\nby a good mechanic, a fashion designer, or a visual artist. The\nproduct of critical thinking may be a well-formulated question,\nan improved definition, a second version of a poem, a new\nfashion design, or a better disposable diaper. It need not be the\nanalysis of an argument. That is one highly intellectual such\nproduct\u2013nottheonlyoneandnot,perhaps,themostimportant\none.\nWhat makes it particularly tempting to identify thinking\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 365 critically with constructing and appraising arguments about the\nobject of one\u2019s thoughts is that the thought that goes into the\ncreation of products other than arguments can so easily and\nnaturally be recast as articulate argument. If a person revises a\nfashion design, and thus has a product of critical thinking other\nthan an argument or argument analysis, she has, in some way,\ntacitly argued against the original thought product and for the\nspecifics of her revision. Suppose that a designer looks critically\nat a design and sees that the skirt would give greater freedom\nof movement and look better with low heels if it were just two\ninches shorter and an inch larger around the bottom. We can\ninsistthat,tacitlyatleast,sheisarguing.Thenewdesignemerges\nfromtheoldonebecausethedesignerhas,ineffect,constructed\nand endorsed the following argument:\n1. In the old design, the skirt is just a little too narrow to be\ncomfortable for walking.\n2. Intheolddesign,theskirtisjustlongenough thatitwilllooknice\nonly with high-heeled shoes, whereas a walking skirt should look\nnice with low-heeled shoes.\n3. The skirt would still be attractive if it were a little wider and\nshorter.\nTherefore,\n4. The skirt should be a little wider and shorter.\nBy such recasting techniques, we can represent all critical\nthinking as argumentation. The argument represented is\nconsidered to be implicit and tacit, as necessary. This move\nseems right in some ways, though it is misleading in others.\nArguments are public entities; they are articulated pieces, set\nout so that specific reasons appear, offered as support for\nconclusions. Arguments are couched in just so many words.\nCritical thinking, however, may be less articulate, especially in\n366TRUDYGOVIER some contexts. The recast argument for the fashion design\nnecessarilyomitsexactlywhatwouldbecrucialinthesuccessful\nrevision of a design: the deliberative, experiential basis for the\naesthetic judgment that the skirt would look all right, or even\nbetter,whenaltered.Thisisalludedtointhethirdpremiseofthe\nstatedargument,butthewordscannotfullyexpressthesenseof\nbalance, symmetry, and appropriateness on which the judgment\nwould have been founded.\nThosehardorimpossibletoarticulatesuspicions,perceptions,\nimpressions, and judgments may very well be a central part of\ncriticalthinking,however.Wemayfollowaninchoatesuspicion,\navaguesensethatsomewheresomething iswrongandbydoing\nso, come up with the crucial question that reveals the faulty\nassumption,ortheflawinthedesign.Criticalthinkingasprocess\nis not only argument construction and argument analysis. It is\nmore haphazard and far less articulate than that. These aspects\nare central to its very nature. A model of critical thinking\nthrough argumentation is very likely to underestimate the\nimportance of those aspects. For that reason, it is to be resisted.\nIn short, argument construction and analysis are too narrow to\nfully encompass what is involved in critical thinking.\nThe same conclusion maybe drawnfromtheworkofRichard\nPaul. In an influential article exploring the nature and impact of\ncourses on informal logic, argumentation, and critical thinking,\nPaulexpressedtheconcernthatmanystudentswouldnotreceive\nsufficient impetus to reexamine their own interests,\npreconceptions,andbiasesbutwouldratherusetheapparatusof\natomistically construed argument analysis to secure their views\nagainst searching criticism. Seeing arguments as presupposing\nother beliefs, and constituent concepts founded upon interests\nand cultural assumptions, Paul urged that real critical thinking\nwould require far more than an appraisal of premises and\nconclusion and the relation between them.22\nStudents, much as we might sometimes wish it, do not come to us as\n\u2018blank tableaux\u2019, upon which we can enscribe the inference-drawing\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 367 patterns,analyticskills,andtruthfacingmotivationsthatwevalue.Any\nstudent studying critical thinking at the university level has a highly\ndeveloped belief system buttressed by deep-seated uncritical, egocentric\nand sociocentric habits of thought by which he interprets and processes\nhis or her experience, whether academic or not, and places it into some\nlargerperspective.Thepracticalresultisthatmoststudentsfinditeasy\ntoquestionjustandonlythosebeliefs,assumptions,andinferencesthat\ntheyhavealready\u2018rejected\u2019andverydifficult,insomecases,traumatic,\ntoquestionthose in which they have a personal, egocentric investment.\nPaul claims that our conceptualizations and beliefs rest upon\nour interests. An appreciation of this and of the fact that other\npeople can have other interests, or that our interests might\nchange, should lead to a greater willingness to scrutinize\nfundamentalbeliefssothatwecantranscendouregocentricand\nsociocentric prejudices. Genuine critical thinking, Paul urges,\nwill include a willingness to question our background beliefs\nand assumptions, to probe for the influence of interests, and\nsometimes to revise the very concepts in which we have posed\nourquestionsandproblems.Inthefullestsense,criticalthinking\nwould encompass a kind of epistemological psychiatry and\nmetaphysics\u2013psychiatryinitsunderstandingofhowourdesires\nand interests led us to think the way we do, and metaphysics in\nits appreciation for radically alternative conceptual frameworks\nfor understanding the world. This activity will clearly be more\nsweeping than atomistic argument analysis.\nThe pedagogic implications of Paul\u2019s view seem to be that\ncritical thinking should be taught by teaching the rest of\nphilosophy (at least). Surely its pedagogy will be broadly based,\nfor a scrutiny of arguments is to include a study of why the\nquestions posed are taken seriously; what competing interests\nbearontheproblem;whatalternativeconceptsmightbeusedto\nformulatetheproblem;howourownbeliefs,usedtoappraisethe\narguments, are founded; and much else.\nThis sounds like an unmanageably large curriculum, and one\nin which a philosophy teacher would be frequently tempted to\n368TRUDYGOVIER fall back on his own \u2018egocentric\u2019 and \u2018sociocentric\u2019 prejudices\nin offering accounts of interests and alternatives. For instance,\narguments about abortion appear in North American in a much\ndifferent guise than they do in China. Which of our interests\nand background beliefs result in this? There are many possible\nhypotheses about individualism, Catholicism, Marxism, and\npoverty: which is or are correct is a vastly complex issue of\nhistory and sociology. (It would take a lot of high powered\ninformationandcriticalthinkingtofigurethisout,grantingthat\nit is possible at all.) An infinite regress is implied here.\nWe may acknowledge Paul\u2019s point about the expansive scope\nof critical thinking without feeling entirely comfortable about\nthe pedagogical implications of his account. A reasonable\ncompromise would be to recognize the narrower scope of\nargument construction and analysis as pedagogically more\nmanageable and responsible, while acknowledging the analytic\npointthatargumentanalysiscannotexhaustthescopeofcritical\nthinking. We would thus stay away from broad psychiatric and\nmetaphysical hypotheses while teaching argument analysis. At\nthe same time we may acknowledge the truth of Paul\u2019s account\nby our recognition that argument analysis cannot be said to be\nall that is involved in critical thinking.\nEven those disposed to use \u2018informal logic\u2019 and \u2018critical\nthinking\u2019 as virtual synonyms have recognized in one way or\nanother that the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 is too broad to be\ncapturedevenbythebroadenedsenseoflogicthatcharacterizes\nthe informal logic movement. As we have seen, critical thinking\nrequires information, and has status as a pre-articulate process\nthat makes a full identification here inappropriate. What is\nsometimes proposed is, in effect, an operational definition of\n\u2018critical thinking\u2019 that would identify it with a battery of skills\ninvolving deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning,\nidentification of fallacies, location of assumptions, spotting of\npoor definitions, finding of conclusions, and much else from\nthe standard array of topics in informal logic courses.23 Critical\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 369 thinking would be defined by reference to such traditionally\nlogical operations as finding ambiguities and fallacies,\ndetermining the deductive validity or cogency of arguments,\ndistinguishing value judgments from factual judgments,\nunderstandingthedistinctionbetweendeductionandinduction,\nand so on.24 Such a stipulative definition will, in effect, give\nphilosophers professional status as society\u2019s experts on critical\nthinking, with many possible fringe benefits for employment\nand prestige.\nThere are, however, significant objections to this approach.\nFirst of all, it is misleading to the potential audience. Suppose\nthat we admit that the concept of critical thinking is broad, and\nincludes not only information but pre-articulate awareness of\nmechanical or aesthetic factors, and synthetic or hypothesizing\nabilities.Thenwehave,ineffect,concededthatwhatwetreatin\na philosophical course on critical thinking is only an important\nand central part of critical thinking. It is not all of it. Even\nargumentevaluationcannotbefullytaughtinformalorinformal\nlogic courses, since such courses cannot, by their very nature,\nprovide all of what is needed in the way of substantive\nknowledge. However rich, careful, imaginative, and useful they\nmay be, courses that teach argument construction, analysis, and\nevaluation cannot cover all aspects of critical thinking. We\nshould not adopt definitions that imply that they do.\nTo do so will be to encourage others and ourselves to forget\nwhatfallsoutsidethedefinition.Thesituationmaybecompared\nwith the temptation, irresistible to some psychometricians, to\nidentify intelligence with I.Q. It will not do to operationalize\nintelligence as I.Q., because there are aspects of intelligence \u2013\nthe intelligent handling of emotionally distraught people, for\ninstance \u2013 not covered by I.Q.25 The prevalence of this\noperationalization reinforces society\u2019s tendency to think of\nintelligence in terms of verbal and mathematical ability of\ncertain kinds, and to neglect other dimensions.\nIt can demoralize people with a low I.Q. and lead them to\n370TRUDYGOVIER thinkthattheyareinnosenseintelligent.Weshouldlearnfrom\nthis experience and not encourage analogous errors for critical\nthinking.\nMany people every day engage in critical thinking without\never having had a course on formal logic, informal logic, or\nphilosophy. They engage in critical thinking without ever\nthinking to themselves that they are doing so. In this respect,\ncriticalthinkingislikespeakinginprose.Whentherearecourses\nand \u2018experts\u2019 on critical thinking, such people might well be led\nto think that they cannot do it because they have never been\ntaught. This kind of inference would be disempowering to say\ntheleast.Theoperationalizationof\u2018criticalthinking\u2019intoalistof\ninformal logic capabilities that form a discrete academic subject\nthatcanbetaughtandmarkedisobjectionableforthisreasonin\naddition to others.\nOperationally defining \u2018critical thinking\u2019 in terms of informal\nlogic skills, we can then teach informal logic and discover that,\njudging by tests based on our operationalization, students have\nimproved their critical thinking. If we are trying to show that\ninformal logic will improve and cultivate critical thinking, such\naprocedureisobviouslyquestion-begging.Alternatively,wecan\nseek to show that a course on informal logic improves students\u2019\nabilities to do informal logic. (This is likely, but not certain.\nA course might fail so totally that it did not even convey the\ninformationdirectlytaught.)Ifweshowwehavetaughtinformal\nlogic in an informal logic course, that\u2019s fine, and will count\ntowards establishing that we have taught critical thinking. Since\ninformal logic and critical thinking are semantically and\npsychologicallydistinct,thefirstconclusionisnotidenticalwith\nthesecond.Wemayseektoshowthatacourseoninformallogic\nimproves students\u2019 abilities at critical thinking, more generally\ndefined. This seems likely, though testing it will be more\ndifficult. What we must not do is confuse the first conclusion\nwith the second one. This is what operational definitions of\n\u2018critical thinking\u2019 in terms of informal logic skills invite us to do.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 371 Pedagogically the danger of too closely identifying critical\nthinking with argumentation skills is that other aspects of\ncritical thinking may be neglected. A critical thinker may, in\ncertain contexts, require synthetic, aesthetic, mechanical, or\nother skills that will be needed only rarely when the product of\ncritical thought is to be an articulated argument or argument\nevaluation.\nThis is no objection to learning to do argument analysis,\nbecause doing this is useful and important in many ways.\nHowever, the construction and critical evaluation of arguments\ndoes not encompass every dimension of critical thinking.\nNeither students, nor teachers, nor the public at large should be\nencouraged to think that it does.\nNotes\nThis chapter has profited from discussion on an occasion when\nitwaspresentedatTrentUniversityandalsofromcommentsby\nJohn McPeck, Ralph Johnson, Tony Blair, and David Hitchcock.\n1. Not quite. John McPeck has argued that it is wrong to think\nof abilities in this context, because there is too little transfer\nfrom one area to another.

This point is increasingly acknowledged by psychologists.\nHoward Gardner\u2019s recent Frames of Mind (New York: Basic\nBooks, 1983) argues for at least seven distinct human\nintelligences. only three of which are covered by I.Q. tests.

It would\nbe a massive task to comment on their merits; obviously this chapter\nis at best of limited relevance years after it was written. Given the\ncommonrequirementtoindicatecriticalthinkingskillsanddispositions\nonamechanicallyscorabletestofabout50minutesinlength,thereare\nrestrictions.Questionsmustbeaboutfairlymanageableissuesrequiring\nonlylimitedbackgroundmaterialandtheymustbewordedsoasnotto\nbeopentodifferentinterpretations.Therearemanyotherrequirements;\nthesealonesuggestthatsuchtestswillfavourinventedpassages.Should\nessay questions supplement short answer tests?\nIfcertainsortsofquestionsneedtoberemoved,moreissueswillarise\naboutthescopeofthetests.Howwouldthoseworkingonargumentation\nstudies, critical thinking, and test development today respond to such\nconcerns? When this chapter was written, I was concerned about social\nand institutional demands for quickly obtainable quantifiable results\nthat would measure something as fundamental and important as\ncritical thinking skills. I wondered whether there was something rather\nabsurd about the idea that people should be asked to demonstrate, in\nshort and clear order, their capacity to think critically \u2013 and also\nsomething absurd about the notion that philosophers should engage in\nconstructing tests to do just that. Professional interests lead to such\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 377 efforts and there are hundreds of results. But there is still space for\nreflection about the assumptions and institutional requirements\nunderlying them.\nAs I write, in the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump, there is great\nconcern about problems of fake and allegedly fake news, media bias\nand distortion, \u2018alternate facts\u2019, truthiness, and confabulation. In high\nquarters, there seems to be little respect for facts and truth, consistency\nand coherency \u2013 to say nothing of decent civility. We find increased\npublicattentiontotheimportanceofcriticalthinking;indeedmanycry\nout for more of it. By implication, there should be increased attention\nto the teaching and cultivation of critical thinking and to the quality\nof related testing material. Sadly some who respond seem carelessly\nunaware of decades of work by informal logicians and argumentation\ntheorists, substituting instead their own sense that they themselves are\ncompetent critical thinkers. The challenges are many and of great\nimportance.\nIf we are going to claim to teach critical thinking, we will\nwant to check out our claims. On standard accounts, this would\ninvolve testing students for critical thinking abilities or skills.\nIf students test higher after a course than before it, we would\nnaturally infer that the course has improved their critical\nthinking skills. In addition, since we value critical thinking\nability, we may wish to test it as a basis for admission to\noccupations or educational programs. Standard testing could\nthenbeusedtoratestudents,andcriticalthinkingabilityasthus\ntested could be a factor in admission decisions.\nTests to measure critical thinking have existed for three\ndecadesatleast.Forseniorhighschoolandcollegeagestudents,\nthe best known are the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests and the\nWatson-Glaser tests.1 The Cornell tests are at two levels \u2013 level\nX,whichisforstudentsasyoungasgradesfiveandsixandupto\nthehighschoollevel;andlevelZ,forcollegeagestudents.Other\ncritical thinking or reasoning skills tests are aimed at much\nyounger students, in elementary schools, and some are designed\n378TRUDYGOVIER tobeusedatvariousagesrangingfromelementarytoseniorhigh\nschool.\nCriticalthinkingtestshave,untilrecently,beengivenrelatively\nlittle scrutiny and analysis from philosophers. Nor have they\nreceived the political attention given to I.Q. and some other\npsychological tests. A recent article in Harper\u2019s magazine,\nscathing in its comments on tests marketed by the American\nEducationalTestingServiceandthesocialattitudesgeneratinga\ndemand for them, had not a word to say about critical thinking\ntests.2Sincethesetestsarebasedontheideathatcriticalthinking\nability is something teachable and acquired by students, rather\nthan something fixed which might be inherited and racially or\nsexuallylinked,thecontextinwhichtheyhavebeendevelopedis\nradically different from that underlying I.Q. tests.3\nNevertheless, when John McPeck attacked critical thinking\ntests in his book Critical Thinking and Education, his comments\nreceived a surprised, but sympathetic response from many\nphilosophers. A seminar on the tests, in which McPeck\nexchanged comments with Robert Ennis, creator of the well-\nestablished Cornell tests, stimulated considerable interest at a\nsymposium on informal logic.4 Audience consensus seemed to\nbe that the debate was fascinating and the result a draw.\nReflection on critical thinking tests brings out many\ninteresting issues about critical thinking, argument analysis,\ninferringskillsandabilitiesfromresults,andtheimplicationsof\nusingmachine-gradableshort-answertestsforavarietyofsocial\npurposes.\n1.Mechanized Tests and the Concept of Critical Thinking\nTheconceptofcriticalthinkingisabroadandcontestableone.\nThe kind of critical thinking one might do in improving on a\nplay or revising the fundamental assumptions of a social theory\nis not likely to be elicited on a mechanically scorable 50 minute\ntest.5 The context is too limited for either; the focus too verbal\nfor the former and too atomistic and temporally restricted for\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 379 the latter.6 In teaching there is inevitably some restriction as to\nwhat is taken as critical thinking. Restrictions are bound to be\ngreater in the context of a short-answer machine-gradeable test\nthat can be taken in an hour or so.\nMechanically scorable critical thinking tests have to deal with\narticulated thought about small, easily described issues where\nanswers do not diverge due to differences in political or ethical\nperspective or on the basis of varying background knowledge.\nQuestions and illustrative material have to be minimally\nsusceptible of divergent interpretations. They have to be clear\ncutandexpressibleinbriefphrases.Theycannotpresumemuch\nbackground knowledge about any particular substantive issue\nunless those to whom the test is to be given can be expected\nto have uniform knowledge on that matter \u2013 a condition which\nwould rarely be met in practice. The material used must not be\nsusceptive to a variety of interpretations; interesting figures of\nspeech, irony and sarcasm, and suggestive ambiguities will have\nto be avoided. Thus tests almost always use invented passages\nrather than real ones. From all these requirements, we can see\nthat the construction of such tests is indeed a challenging task.\nObviously, these necessary restrictions mean that many\naspects of critical thinking could not possibly be included on\nsuch tests. We cannot in such a context test for abilities to\nelucidate judicious value judgments about sensitive topics, to\nfind underlying metaphysical or social assumptions, or identify\nmechanical or aesthetic flaws not easily characterized in words.\nNor can we handle material incorporating and exploiting subtle\nnuances of meaning. The format of the tests, and the social\ndemandsplaceduponthem,makethesethingsimpossible.These\nmatters are too profound to be amenable to the short answer\nandtimeframeformat,toocontroversialbynatureforsufficient\nagreement in a key of answers, and too hard to sum up in a\nfew words. If we value these aspects of critical thinking, we are\nlikely to conclude that critical thinking ability is not testable by\nmechanical short-answers methods.\n380TRUDYGOVIER There is a distinction to be drawn between external and\ninternal criticism of critical thinking tests. Internal criticism\nwould focus on the details of particular tests. What range of\nitems, within the range which can be handled by the format, is\nincluded on the test? Is the proportion of various items about\nright? Are instructions given in clear language? Most\nsignificantly, are keyed answers correct, and are they the only\nalternative answers that reasonably seem to be correct? These\ninternalissuesariseprovidedthatonehasdecidedtotrytoelicit\nresponsesinamechanicaltestformatandtaketheseresponsesas\nindicative of critical thinking ability. If internal criticism should\nreveal flaws in popular tests, it is an important issue whether\ntheseflawsareendemictotheendeavourorwhethertheyare,as\nit were, accidental. If we found flaws and decided they were of a\ntype that could be avoided only by stringent restrictions on the\ncontentoftests,wewouldnaturallybeledtothestageofexternal\ncriticism.\nExternalcriticismisbroaderinfocus.Itaddressesthequestion\nof how significant those aspects of critical thinking that cannot\nin principle be handled on these tests are to critical thinking\nability.Itmayaddressalsothesocio-political question astowhy\nthere is a need to attempt to measure critical thinking ability by\nmeansofamachine-gradableshort-answertestandwhetherthis\nneed is one that philosophers and other academics should try to\nmeet. Here, sections two and three treat internal issues, section\nfour external ones.\n2.Test Performance and Critical Thinking Ability\nTo reach on the basis of test performance a conclusion about\nsomeone\u2019s critical thinking ability requires a number of\ninferences.Interestingly,ifweexaminetheinferencestageshere,\nthereisanasymmetrybetweenthepositiveandthenegativecase.\nThat is, different kinds of things can interfere with the merits of\nanargumentfromdoingwellonatesttohavingcriticalthinking\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 381 ability and an argument from doing poorly on such a test to not\nhaving critical thinking ability.\nTo see how this works, let us first consider the positive case.\nSupposethatacriticalthinkingtesthasbeenconstructedandan\nindividual performs well on that test. We wish, then, to reason\nfrom that good performance to the judgement that he or she\nhas critical thinking ability. This conclusion will be based on a\nnumber of steps, which may be ordered as follows:\n1. S does Q. (That is, S answers a high number of questions on\nthetestcorrectly.Thisisastraightbehavioraljudgment;itis\ntosaythatasuitablyhighpercentageofS\u2019sanswerscoincide\nwith keyed answers.)\nTherefore,\n2. S can do Q. (That is, S is able to answer a high number of\nquestionsonthetestcorrectly.)Therearetwopresumptions\nhere. The first is that the coincidence of S\u2019s answers with\nkeyed answers is not due to fluke, accident, or cheating, but\nduerathertofeaturesofS.Thetest-takergetskeyedanswers\nbecause of some ability or mental power he or she has. This\nleads to the second point. The claim implies that the keyed\nanswers really are correct answers. If keyed answers were\nwrong, or if they were correct but not uniquely correct,\ngettinganswerthatcoincidedwithkeyedanswerswouldnot\nshow that one can get these answers in the sense of having\nanabilityorpowertoarriveatthem.7Itwouldappeareither\nto be accidental, the product of training, due to a similarity\nin tendency to err between the respondent and the person\nwho constructed the test, or the result of a combination of\nthese factors.\nTherefore,\n3. S can do Q\u2019, where Q\u2019 is a set of questions similar to, but not\nidenticalwith,thoseonthetest.(Thatis,thequestionsQare\n382TRUDYGOVIER a subset of Q\u2019, and they represent the whole set sufficiently\nwell that being able to do them correctly is good inductive\nevidence that one will be able to do the rest correctly.\nQuestions represent an array of questions and problems an\narrayofproblemtypes.Forexample,ifScando,onthetest,\nsome particular deductions involving class relationships,\nthenScandomanyfurtherdeductionsrelevantlysimilarto\nthose presented on the test.)\nTherefore,\n4. S has (a high level of) Q (critical thinking) ability. (Given that\nthe questions in Q\u2019 represent the whole array, or a very\nsignificantproportion,ofquestionsthatcapturetheconcept\nofcriticalthinkingandthatSknowshowtodoquestionsof\nthis type, we conclude that S has critical thinking ability.)\nIt is useful to look at this sequence of inferences and see what\nissues arise at various points. At the first stage, from (1) to (2),\nwhat is at issue is, in part, background circumstances pertaining\nto teaching and test taking and the construction of the test. It\nis important to note that these factors are largely within the\ncontrolofteachers,professors,andtestconstructors,anddonot\npertain to personal idiosyncrasies and problems in motivation\nor concentration that may affect respondents. If a test is poorly\nconstructed,someonemaygetalargenumberofcorrectanswers\nby merely guessing, or by being attuned to the kind of thing\ntest constructors are usually looking for and the kinds of\nconstructions they usually make. To see this, consider some\nextreme cases. Keyed answers might fall into a pattern abba,\nbccb,cddc,orwhatever,detectedbytherespondent.Oraperson\nmight have been taught to take that very test, and fill in many\ncorrect answers due to rote memory, so that the correctness\nof his answers did not show that he could answer even those\nquestions he got right.8\nThe inference from (1) to (2) presumes that keyed answers are\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 383 rightand,amongalternativesoffered,uniquelyright.Wewishto\ninfer from the coincidence of a subject\u2019s answers with the keyed\nanswersthathehastheabilitytogettheseanswers.Thenotionof\n\u2018ability\u2019inthiscontextisnormativeandcontainswithinitselfthe\nimplication that the answers are correct. The ability to answer\na problem in this context is more like the ability to sing than\nlike the ability to breathe. A person cannot breathe incorrectly,\nso if he breathes at all and the breathing is a product of his own\npowers rather than mechanical intervention, he has the ability\nto breathe. However, a person can sing badly or well; speaking\nof the ability to sing, we would typically imply satisfactory\nperformance.Thus,fromthefactthatapersonsingsatall,itdoes\nnotfollowthathehastheabilitytosing,as\u2018abilitytosing\u2019would\ncommonly be used in this context. Clearly, in a test context,\nwe are concerned not merely with the capacity to understand\ntest questions and insert answers, but with the ability to answer\nthe test questions correctly. To get any evidence for this from\nperformance on the test clearly presumes that answers keyed as\ncorrect really are correct.9 If the test is well designed so that\ngetting good answers is almost certainly a result of\ncharacteristics of the respondent, and if there are no contestable\nanswers, then the inference from (1) to (2) should go through.\nThe second inference, from (2) to (3), raises a new issue. It\nconcerns the representativeness of the various questions on the\ntest. Given any question, we can construct a similar question by\nvarying a nonessential feature. If a respondent can detect that\nthe inference in \u2018If Fred is thin, he is fit; Fred is fit; therefore\nFred is thin\u2019 is flawed, it would be absolutely astounding if he\ncould not detect the same flaw in \u2018If Joe is thin, he is fit; Joe is\nfit;thereforeheisthin\u2019.Necessarily,therewillbegeneralizations.\nThe question will arise as to how far we can generalize \u2013 how\nwe generate Q\u2019 from Q. Surely there would be no controversy\naboutsubstituting\u2018Joe\u2019for\u2018Fred\u2019intheaboveexample,butother\nsubstitutions are not so straightforward. Seeing the question as\nan example of faulty reasoning using a conditional, someone\n384TRUDYGOVIER might suggest that anyone who could get this question right has\nunderstood the conditional and would get the right answer on\n\u2018IfJaneFondafolkdances,JaneFondaisfit;JaneFondadoesnot\nfolkdance;thereforeJaneFondaisnotfit.\u2019Alternately,onemight\nsee the question as representative only of instances of affirming\ntheconsequent,butonemightseethisasindependentofsubject\nmatter.Thusifarespondentcouldhandletheinitialexample,he\nshould be able to handle the formally similar one, \u2018If mermaids\nare mathematicians, mathematicians have tails; mathematicians\nhave tails; so mermaids are mathematicians.\u2019 Alternatively, one\nmightseethequestionassimilartoanotherinstanceofaffirming\nthe consequent where component statements were more\ncomplex and involved a more abstract subject matter, as in \u2018If\nscience and philosophy have the same essential structure, then,\nifscience ispartiallyempirical, philosophyispartiallyempirical.\nIfscienceispartiallyempirical,philosophyispartiallyempirical.\nTherefore, science and philosophy have the same essential\nstructure.\u2019\nProbably most logicians would be comfortable with the first\ntwo variations as members of Q\u2019 but uncertain about the third.\nPsychological evidence is surely relevant here, however. It is\npossible that formally similar examples, even at the same level\nof formal complexity (as the first two variations are and the\nthird variation is not) are not handled similarly by most test\nrespondents. The second example includes counterfactual\nmaterial of a bizarre nature, which might confuse respondents.\nInfact,eventheinitialexample,involvingthinnessandfitness,is\nemotionallychargedinourcultureinawaysomeotherexamples\nof affirming the consequent would not be. It might for this\nreason be assimilated to other cases of reasoning clearly on\nemotional material. Psychological evidence indicates that the\nexpectations of logicians in this area are frequently not met.\nPeoplemaybeclearonconditionalrelationshipswhentheydeal\nwith familiar, unthreatening subject matter, yet handle them\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 385 badlywhentheymovetounfamiliar,highlyemotional,orhighly\nabstract subject matter.10\nThus, the generation of Q\u2019 from Q depends on both logical\nand psychological considerations. It is a logical judgment that two\nexamples embody the same logical principle. It is a psychological\njudgment that someone who can grasp and apply this principle to\nthe first example can do so with the second. Possibly logic and\npsychologywilldivergeinunexpectedways.Perhapspeoplewill\nbe able to detect affirming the consequent when the example\nis mathematical and the conclusion reached false, but not when\nthe example involves health and nutrition and the conclusion\nrepresentsawidelyheldandsociallypowerfulbelief.Orperhaps\npeople who easily detect persuasive definitions in contexts of\nadvertisingwillnotdetectthemincontextsofpoliticalspeeches\nby authoritative figures, even though their logical structure is\nessentiallythesameinbothcases.Thesequestionsareempirical.\nThenextandlastinference,from(3)to(4),willdependonhow\nrepresentativethequestionsinQ\u2019areofissuescallingforcritical\nthinking. If we specify a list of all the kinds of things a critical\nthinker should be able to do11 and compare Q\u2019 with such a list,\nthen the inference from (3) to (4) will depend on how close the\ncomparisonis.Suppose,forexample,thatwedecidedwewanted\na critical thinker to be sceptical about the most fundamental\nmetaphysical and political assumptions of our society, and we\nwanted him or her to have a disposition to apply this kind of\nscepticism even within daily life. This desideratum would likely\nnotbecapturedbyQ.Soifwehadsuchanelementasanessential\npart of our concept of critical thinking, we would regard the\ninference from (3) to (4) as shaky, first conceptually, and as a\nresult, inductively. If, on the other hand, we were to define\ncritical thinking as the ability to do deductive and inductive\ninferences, evaluate analogies, identify fallacies, and detect\nvagueness and ambiguity, we might easily find all these aspects\nin Q\u2019. The inference from (3) to (4) would appear strong. The\n386TRUDYGOVIER concept of critical thinking is an essentially contestable one, so\nthis inference is bound to be questionable.\nIt is instructive to compare the series of inference steps just\nexplored to a parallel series premised on poor test performance.\n(x1) S does not do Q. That is, the respondent does not answer\n(most) questions correctly. Again, this is a straight behavioral\njudgment.Thereisadiscrepancybetweentheanswersthetest-\ntaker gives and the keyed answers.\nTherefore,\n(x2) S cannot do Q. This is to say that the respondent fails\nto answer correctly because of some aspect of his or her\ncapacities pertaining to the questions. The failure is not due\nto rebelliousness, sleepiness, accident, lack of attention,\nmisreading of instructions, or flaws in questions.\nTherefore,\n(x3) S cannot do Q\u2019. The questions S cannot do on the test\nare taken to represent a broader range of questions, and S\u2019s\ninabilitytodothemindicatesinabilitiesinthisbroaderareaas\nwell.\nTherefore,\n(x4)Shaslittlecriticalthinkingability.QuestionsinQ\u2019represent\na core area of critical thinking ability, and S is unable to do\nthem, so he or she is a poor critical thinker.\nA very important asymmetry occurs with the first level of\ninference here. As in the positive case, things may go wrong.\nBut there is a difference in that what can go wrong includes\naspectsoftherespondentandhisorhersituation,thingsoutside\nthe control of test constructors and professors. If a respondent\ngot drunk the night before, or is feeling rebellious and wants\nto undermine the instructor by indicating that he did not learn\nanything in a course, he can put incorrect answers for reasons\nthat having nothing to do with his inability to get the answer\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 387 right. The inference from (x1) to (x2) might fall down due to\nflaws in test construction. In fact, this seems more likely in the\nnegative case than in the positive one. To get a whole series of\nthings right by accident on a test is inductively unlikely; to get\na whole series of things wrong by accident much more likely.\n(One might, for example, misread a crucial word in a set of\ninstructions applying to a large section of the test, or code in\nanswers in the wrong place.) Thus it seems that the inference\nfrom having a high score to being able to do the questions is in\ngeneral stronger than the inference from having a low score to\nnot being able to do them. There are fewer ways in which the\nformer can go wrong, instructors and testing professionals have\nmorecontroloverthesefactors,andthepertinentcircumstances\nare less likely to arise in real life.\nThenextstageisclosertothepositivecase:theinferencefrom\n(x2) to (x3) depends on the same kinds of factors as that from\n(2) to (3). In both cases, what is at issue rests on both logic and\npsychology. How similar are the further cases in a logical sense,\nand how likely are people to transfer their competence?\nAsforthelastinference,herethenegativeinferenceisstronger\nthan the positive one. This is because the contestability of the\nconcept of critical thinking affects it less. To see this, we recall\nthat there is really no disagreement about certain minimal\naspects of critical thinking. The disagreement comes when we\nconsider what should be added to these. Should we add having\nbackgroundinformationonavarietyofsubjects?Shouldweadd\nthe ability to do fundamental social criticism? Should we add\ntheabilitytosynthesizediverseaccounts?Tomakeaptanalogies\nbetween apparently disparate areas? To question the social and\npolitical implications of standard linguistic usage? To detect\naesthetically inappropriate elements? The possibilities seem to\nextend indefinitely. For anyone who wants a long list, an\ninference from (3) to (4) will seem doubtful. The term \u2018critical\nthinker\u2019 is to some extent honorific, and we may not wish to\nallow the title to someone who shows only finite and\n388TRUDYGOVIER determinate competence on a short-answer test. On the other\nhand, on virtually any account of critical thinking, deductive\ncompetence,linguisticsensitivity,inductivecompetence,andthe\nability to detect fallacies will constitute minimally necessary\nconditions of critical thinking. If a person lacks these, he or she\nis not a critical thinker, no matter what else this person can do.\nInthenegativecase,oncewemovebeyondthefirststage,things\ngomoresmoothlythaninthepositivecase.However,thecrucial\nfirst stage inference is more questionable.\nPhilosophical issues enter at every stage, and psychological\nones at least at the first two. The philosophical issues fall into\nthree main areas: the correctness of keyed answers; the\ndetermination of the range of problems represented by the test\nset; and the extent to which ability to do problems in that range\nrepresents critical thinking ability. Critical thinking tests will be\ninadequate from a philosophical point of view if a substantial\nportion of keyed answers are not uniquely correct, if the set of\nproblems represented by the test set is too restricted even for\nthe range the test purports to cover, or if that range of sub-\nareas is insufficiently broad. They will be inadequate from a\npsychological point of view if they are not constructed so as to\npreclude such things as getting many right answers by guessing,\nor being sent into a panic by instructions. More interestingly,\ntheymaybepsychologicallyinadequateifthesetQ\u2019isgenerated\nfromthesetQwithinsufficientattentiontonormalcompetence\ninmattersoftransfer.Thereare,ofcourse,furtherpsychological\nissues. Since I cannot presume the competence to assess critical\nthinking tests from a psychological point of view, I shall\nconcentrate on philosophical questions here.12\n3.Content Analysis of Several Popular Critical Thinking Tests\n3a. The Watson-Glaser Test\nTheWatson-GlaserCriticalThinkingAppraisaliswidelyused.\nCirculated by the well-known Psychological Corporation, it has\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 389 been an established pedagogical and evaluation tool for some\ndecades. Two different tests are available; Form A and Form B.\nComments here apply to Form A.13The test has 80 questions,\nwhich are to be done in 50 minutes. It is divided into five equal\nsections.Thefirstsectiondealswithinference;therespondentis\nto decide on \u2018the degree of truth or falsity [sic] of the inference\u2019,\ngiven some facts. Statements are made; the respondent is to\nassume that these are true and then say whether a further\nstatement is true, probably true, left undetermined, probably\nfalse, or false, given the stated claims.14 The second section\ninvolves recognizing assumptions, which are defined in the\ninstructions as something that is presupposed or taken for\ngranted. From examples given, it appears that deductively\nrequired assumptions and pragmatically required assumptions\narebothincluded.Thethirdsectionisaboutdeductiveinference;\nstatements are made and respondents are to say whether other\nstatements follow necessarily from these. The fourth section,\nthough called interpretation, appears to overlap considerably\nwith the first one. The respondent is given some statements and\nasked to say what \u2018follows logically beyond a reasonable doubt\nfrom the information given\u2019; thus deductive and (presumably)\nstrongnondeductiveinferenceareinvolved.Theonlydifference\nbetween this section and the first is that here respondents make\na \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer; thus the fourth section calls for fewer\ndiscriminations than the first one. The last section is about the\nevaluation of arguments. Here again, it is inference or \u2018reasons\nfor and against\u2019 that is in question. Respondents are to \u2018regard\neachargumentastrue\u2019;thatis,theyarenottoquestionthemerits\nof arguments on the grounds that false or unlikely claims are\ncontained within. The point is to determine whether, if true,\nthe claims made in the argument would prove strong or weak\nreasons for a further claim.\nThe wording of some of these instructions would make any\nphilosophically educated person cringe.15 The test is full of\nlogical horrors such as \u2018Examine each inference separately and\n390TRUDYGOVIER make a decision as to its degree of truth or falsity\u2019; \u2018For an\nargument to be strong, it must be both important and directly\nrelated to the question\u2019; \u2018for the purposes of this test, you are\nto regard each argument as true\u2019; \u2018Try not to let your personal\nattitude toward the question influence your evaluation of the\nargument, since each argument is to be regarded as true\u2019; and\n\u2018When the word \u2018should\u2019 is used as the first word in any of the\nfollowing questions, its meaning is, \u2018would the proposed action\npromote the general welfare of the people of the United\nStates?\u201d.16\nOne might defend such wording on the grounds that the test\nis intended for use by people who are not philosophers and are\nnot philosophically educated.17 One might urge that speaking\nof the truth of arguments, degrees of truth, inferences as being\nconclusionsandsoonwillnotbemisleading.However,thereare\nseveralproblemswiththisdefenseofthetest.Firstofall,itisnot\nnecessary to employ such expressions in order to communicate\nwith non-philosophers. Instructions in some other tests do not\nemploy such expressions on respondents, and they are perfectly\ncomprehensible nevertheless. Secondly, the serviceability, of\ntheselogicalinnovationsisinquestion.Thirdly,theinstructions\nwill be confusing to anyone who has studied logic or theory of\nknowledge, even at quite an elementary level. Since the test is\nsupposed to be adequate for college students generally, this is a\nmark against it. The direction to interpret \u2018should\u2019 in terms of\ninterests of the United States indicates an ethnocentrism which\nis entirely contrary to genuine critical thinking within the\nUnited States, and which makes the test quite unsuitable for use\noutside the United States.\nThereareproblemsthatareapproachableintheshort-answer\nformatbutthattheWatson-Glasertestrathermysteriouslyomits\naltogether. These include at least the following: reasoning by\nand about analogy; fallacies, both formal and informal; judging\ncredibility of sources; definitions in context; sensitivity to\nambiguity, vagueness, and emotionally loaded language;\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 391 reasoning about and to explanations; causal reasoning and\nempirical confirmation in experimental contexts. This is a\nsubstantial list.\nThe Watson-Glaser test seems especially narrow when we\nconsider these omissions in the context of the very considerable\nduplication that exists between sections. Sections 1, 3, and 4 are\nextremelysimilar.Section3restrictsitselftodeductiveinference\nfrom given statements; sections 1 and 4 include deductive\ninference and strong probabilistic inference as well. The\ndifferent titles for the sections, \u2018Inference\u2019, \u2018Deduction\u2019, and\n\u2018Interpretation\u2019, disguise the fact that very similar questions\nappear in each.\nFurther problems arise when we come to consider specific\nquestions and keyed answers. Of the 80 questions, eleven are\nquestionable, on my judgment. Some illustrations are discussed\nbelow.\nQuestion 15. (From \u2018Inference\u2019 section: respondents are to say\nwhether, given the initial statements, the further statement is\ntrue. probably true, insufficiently determined by the data,\nprobably false, or false.)\n\u2018SometimeagoacrowdgatheredinMiddletowntohearthenewpresident\nof the local Chamber of Commerce speak. The president said. \u2018I am not\nnowasking,butdemanding,thatlaborunionsnowaccepttheirfullshare\nof responsibility for civic improvement and community welfare. I am\nnot asking, but demanding, that they join the Chamber of Commerce.\u2019\nThe members of the Central Labor Unions who were present applauded\nenthusiastically. Three months later all the labor unions in Middletown\nwere represented in the Chamber of Commerce. These representatives\nworked with representatives of other groups on committees, spoke their\nminds,participatedactivelyinthecivicimprovementprojects,andhelped\nthe Chamber reach the goals set in connection with those projects.\u2019\n\u2018Some of the Chamber of Commerce members came to feel that their\npresidenthadbeenunwiseinaskingtheunionrepresentativestojointhe\nChamber.\u2019\n392TRUDYGOVIER The keyed answer is that there is insufficient data. However,\non best explanation grounds, the answer \u2018probably false\u2019 would\nseem defensible. The key can be defended on the grounds that\nwe are only supposed to consider the given facts. However, in\norder to avoid the inference that members of the Chamber of\nCommerce will be glad to have union participation, we have to\nsuppose that they are not glad to have had their projects and\ngoals so successfully completed. This supposition seems very\nunreasonable.\nQuestion16.(Samesection,sameinstructions;samepassageas\nin question 15.)\n\u2018The new president indicated in the speech that the town\u2019s labor unions\nhad not yet accepted their full responsibility for civilimprovement.\u2019\nThe keyed answer is \u2018true\u2019. However, the answer \u2018probably true\u2019\nseems preferable. The difference hinges on the distinction\nbetween entailment and pragmatic, or conversational,\nimplication. The president has demanded that unions now do\ntheir share. This strongly suggests, but does not entail, that he\nthinks they did not previously do their share. We are asked\nwhether the president \u2018indicated\u2019 in his speech that they had not\nyet accepted full responsibility. There is an indeterminacy in\n\u2018indicated\u2019 that compounds the problem here. If we are being\nasked whether the president said outright that they had not yet\naccepted full responsibility, the answer is no. Yet if we are asked\nwhether he strongly suggested, implied, or virtually said it, the\nanswer is \u2018yes\u2019. Standards for what we are entitled to infer seem\nlooser for question 16 than for question 15.\nQuestion 28. (From the section on assumption; respondents\naretosaywhetheranassumptionismade\u2013takenforgrantedor\npresupposed \u2013 by a person who makes a sample statement.)\nStatement: \u2018I\u2019m traveling to South America. I want to be sure that I do\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 393 not get typhoid fever, so I shall go to my physician and get vaccinated\nagainst typhoid feverbefore I begin my trip.\u2019\nAlleged Assumption: \u2018Typhoid fever is more common in South America\nthan it is where I live.\u2019\nThekeyedansweristhatthisassumptionisnotmade.Wecansee\nhow this answer is defensible, for one might believe typhoid was\nonly equally common in South America than in the place where\nthepersonlives,andhemightwantthevaccinationinanyevent,\nfor his trip. (This seems unlikely, but is possible.) However, the\ninstructions do not tell us to restrict ourselves to assumptions\nthat are necessarily made. A natural explanation, the \u2018best\u2019 by\nmany standards, of wanting this vaccination would be in terms\nof the belief that typhoid is more common in South America\nthanathome;henceitwould,bythistypeofinductivereasoning,\nperhaps be defensible to answer that the assumption is made.\nQuestion 31. (Section on assumptions; same instructions as\nfor question 28.)\nStatement:\u2018Ifwarisinevitable,we\u2019dbetterlaunchapreventivewarnow\nwhile we have the advantage.\u2018\nAllegedAssumption:\u2018Ifwefightnow,wearemorelikelytowinthanwe\nwould be if forced to fight later.\u2018\nThekeyedansweristhattheassumptionismade.Standardsseem\nto be different here than in the previous two questions. There, a\nnatural assumption was \u2018not made\u2019 because an alternative could\nbe envisaged. Here, an alternative is easily envisaged, but the\nassumption is said to be \u2018made\u2019 nonetheless. One might assume\nthatwehaveanadvantagenowandwemayormaynothaveone\nlater; this is to say not that we are more likely to win now, but\nthat we have a relatively sure thing now, whereas the future is\nunknown. This view allows that in the future we might, in fact,\nbe more likely to win, but we would not want to gamble on that\n394TRUDYGOVIER prospect now. This assumption could equally well underlie the\nreasoning; as it is more restrained and attributes to the speaker\na more modest claim to future knowledge, it is arguably more\ncharitable in a real case to attribute it to a speaker. Again, the\nproblem would be eliminated if we had been asked to find\nassumptions that were necessarily made.\nQuestion78.(FromthesectiononEvaluationofArguments.\nOne is to assume that \u2018arguments are true\u2019, and rate them as\nstrong or weak.)\nIssue: Should pupils be excused from public schools to receive religious\ninstructions in their own churches during school hours?\nProposed Argument: \u2018Yes: religious instruction would help overcome\nmoral emptiness, weakness, and lack of consideration for other people,\nall of which appear to be current problems in our nation.\u2019\nRespondents are supposed to deem this argument strong. If we\ngrant the claims, it would be a strong reason to have religious\ninstructions,butnotastrongreasontohaveitbyexcusingpupils\nto go to church during school hours.\nOn the basis of this content analysis, the Watson-Glaser test\ndoesnotfarewell.Itsrangeisnarrow,evenallowingforthefact\nthat some aspects of critical thinking are not within the scope\nofshort-answertests.Itsinstructionsarephilosophicallygarbled\nin an unnecessary and unhelpful way. Within the covered range,\nthere are many contestable items; more than ten per cent of\nthe total items are of this type. If students improve scores by\n15 or 20% from a pre-test to a post-test, little can be inferred,\nbecausetheymaymerelybemoreintunewiththetestwriterson\ncontestable items on the latter occasions than on the former. If\none student surpasses another by 15 or 20%, a fact which would\nsurely be taken as relevant were the tests used for admission\ndecisions, the higher score may reflect little more than luck or\naccord with testers\u2019 background or prejudices. The proportion\nofcontestableitemsistoolarge.Furthermore,someproblematic\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 395 aspects of instructions are so extreme that genuinely critical\nthinkersmightbecomepositivelyangrywiththetestandthereby\ndo badly. Willingness to go along with the instruction to\ninterpret the word \u2018should\u2019 in terms of the welfare of United\nStates citizens is surely inversely related to any capacity for\ncritical thought and analysis.\n3b. The Cornell LevelZTest\nThe Cornell Level Z test is another test of great interest. It\nis designed for students at the college level and is the product\nof years of thought by a well-known logician. In addition, it is\nof special interest because of a recent expert study done in the\nspring of 1983. Test author Robert Ennis invited a number of\ninformal and formal logic teachers to do the test and wrote an\nanalysisoftheirresponses.18The1985versionofthetestisvery\nsimilar to the 1983 version, so the answers apparently did not\nrevealanyseriousflawsinthetest\u2013orsothetestersjudgedfrom\nthe experts\u2019 responses.\nThe Cornell Level Z Test consists of 52 questions to be done\nin 50 minutes. Respondents are advised that the test is \u2018to see\nhow clearly and carefully you think\u2019. They are told to avoid wild\nguesses,thoughtomakeshrewdguesses,iftheyhavesomegood\ncluesbearingontheanswer.Therearesevensectionsinthetest.\nThefirstsectiontestsdeductiveconsequenceandcontradiction.\nMost of the reasoning is syllogistic in nature, not propositional\nor modal. The manual for the tests notes that questions are set\nin strong value-laden contexts, so that there is an emphasis on\nbeing able to reason neutrally with suggestive content. This\nsectioncontainstenquestions.Thesecondsectionisaboutfaults\nin reasoning, if we take the test instructions for respondents at\nface value, and about \u2018semantics\u2019, according to the manual.

There are\nseveralfalsedichotomiesandonehastyinductivegeneralization.\nThegreatestemphasisisonproblemsduetotheuseoflanguage;\n396TRUDYGOVIER this section contains eleven questions. The third section asks\nrespondents to comment, given a specified evidential situation,\non the \u2018believability\u2019 of statements. The manual indicates that it\nis about credibility. \u2018Believability\u2019, the term used in instructions,\nwould seem to indicate that respondents should consider both\nthe credibility of people as sources of knowledge and the\nplausibility, given substantive background information, of the\nclaims they make. This section contains four questions.19\nThe fourth section of the test deals with inductive\nconfirmationreasoningbydescribinganexperimentalsituation,\nand getting respondents to comment on the implications of\nempirical results for an experimental conclusion. The manual\nindicates that best-explanation criteria are to apply in judging\nthe items. The section has thirteen questions. The fifth section\nagainhastodowithinductiveexperimentalreasoning,buthasa\nsomewhat different thrust, in that respondents are to comment\non the logical significance of various predictions. The manual\nindicates thatitis about planning experiments. Respondents are\nto comment on which sort of experiment would have the\ngreatest epistemic usefulness in a described situation. Four\nquestions deal with this aspect. In the sixth section, the focus is\nprimarilyonwordmeaning,howwordsareimplicitlydefinedon\nthebasisoftheiruseinagivencontext.Fourquestionsaregiven.\nIn the seventh and final section, respondents are to comment\non unstated assumptions behind arguments and remarks. The\nproblem is construed in a deductivist way: missing assumptions\nare those that, when supplied,\nwill make a conclusion logically follow from stated premises,\nor an explanandum logically follow from stated explanans. There\nare six questions here.\nClearly, the scope of the Level Z test is considerably broader\nthan that of the Watson-Glaser test. But still, reflecting on its\ncontent in a general way, we can see a number of features of\nargumentation, reasoning, and critical analysis that might have\nbeen,butwerenot,included.Therearenoquestionsthatcallfor\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 397 judgments of relevance. There are none about analogies. There\nare none that deal with conductive (cumulation of factors)\narguments, calling for considering the significance of pros and\ncons. Despite the presence of a section said on the test to deal\nwithfaultyreasoning,anumberoffallaciesmakenoappearance\non the test. Straw man, ad hominem, the argument from\nignorance, guilt by association, such deductive fallacies as\ndenying the antecedent, and many others are entirely omitted.\nThere is no section addressed to the interpretation of discourse,\nandattemptingtoelicitrespondents\u2019abilitiestodistinguishwhat\nwas said from what was not said. (Missing assumptions could\nhave been treated in this context.) No real passages are used.\nAll material has been invented for the test; presumably this is to\nensure maximum clarity and neutrality. No section tests ability\nto subsume cases under stated principles. Within the deductive\nsection,thereisnomaterialpertainingtopropositionalormodal\nlogic; only class relations are tested. Nor is there any testing\nof general sense of argument structure \u2013 whether one or two\nconclusions are drawn, whether there are subarguments, or\nwhether premises are linked or bear separately on the\nconclusion.20\nIf we look at the content of the test, it seems to have been\nconstructed on the basis of a broadly positivist theory of\nargument. This should not be surprising, in the light of the\nprominence of that particular theory, especially among\nphilosophers.Inductivereasoningisincluded,despiteitsgreater\ndifficulties for the tester, and is apparently construed as\ninvolving confirmation in experimental contexts and credibility\nreasoning pertaining to sources of information. There are many\nquestionsthatcallforsensitivitytolanguage\u2013ambiguity,tricky\nuse of definitions, and meaning in context. There are questions\nondeductiverelations,primarilyconsequences,consistency,and\ninconsistency. Nevertheless, independent scholarly thought,\npractical decision-making, judging actual arguments, and\nparticipating competently in debate surely require judgments\n398TRUDYGOVIER of relevance and a good sense of classification so that stated\nprinciples can be properly applied. Legal and moral reasoning\ndepend heavily on analogies, as does the use of models in\nscientificreasoning.Inaddition,analogyisapowerfulrhetorical\ndevice, and the basis of many deceptive arguments. A sense of\nunderlyingargumentstructurecanbeveryimportantforcritical\nevaluation, as when one premise in an argument is false, and we\nneed to look to see how this affects the cogency of the rest of\ntheargument. Anyability todothisisuntested, thoughitwould\nseem in principle amenable to inclusion on a test in this format.\nIt seems strange to include a section on faulty reasoning and\nyet pay so little attention to fallacies. There is much attention\nto abuse of language in the section on faulty reasoning, while\nfallacies as traditionally construed scarcely appear.21\nSofarasthequestionsposedandkeyedanswersareconcerned,\ndespite great care and willingness to elicit expert criticism,\ncontestable items remain on the Cornell Level Z (1985).\nDifferent analysts would no doubt differ on this matter \u2013 a fact\nthatisitselfofsomesignificance.Myownscrutinyofthetestand\nkeyedanswersleftmewithsomeconcernsastosevenquestions,\nnearly fifteen per cent of the total.22Here are details for some\nexamples.\nQuestion 12. (In the section on faulty reasoning or, as\ndescribed in the manual, \u2018semantics\u2019.)\nDOBERT: I guess you know that to put chlorine in the water is to\nthreaten the health of everyone of Galltown\u2019s citizens, and that, you\u2019ll\nadmit, is bad.\nALGAN: What right do you have to say that our health will be\nthreatened?\nDOBERT:\u2018Healthyliving\u2019maybedefinedaslivingaccordingtonature.\nNow we don\u2019t find chlorine added to water in nature. Therefore,\neveryone\u2019s health would be threatened if chlorine were added.\nPick the one best reason why some of this thinking is faulty.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 399 A. Dobert is using emotional language that doesn\u2019t help to\nmake his argument reasonable.\nB. Dobert\u2019s thinking is in error.\nC. Dobert is using a word in two different ways.\nThe keyed answer is C. Clearly this makes sense, because\nDobert\u2019s first comment would appear to use \u2018health\u2019 in the\nordinary sense as meaning absence of disease, and his response\nstipulates a special meaning. However, A is also a reasonable\nanswer, because \u2018nature\u2019, which figures in the stipulative\ndefinition,isanemotionallypositiveterm.Also,wemerelyinfer\nthat Dobert\u2019s first use of \u2018health\u2019 is our ordinary one. Thus, our\nevidence that a word is used in two different senses could be\nsaid to be less convincing than our evidence that Dobert uses\nemotional language that doesn\u2019t help make his argument\n\u2018reasonable\u2019.\nQuestion 14. (Again, from the section on faulty reasoning or\n\u2018semantics\u2019.)\nDOBERT:Iunderstandthatyoulookonthisthingasanexperiment.\nI\u2019m sure that the citizens of Gallton don\u2019t want to be guinea pigs in\nthis matter.\nALGAN: This is a demonstration. Nobody ought to object to a\ndemonstration,sincethepurposeofademonstrationisnottofindout\nsomething, but rather to show us something that is already known.\nAn additional value of this demonstration of chlorination is that its\npurpose isalsototestforthelong-rangeeffectsofchlorination onthe\nhuman body. This objective of the demonstration is a worthy one.\nPick the one best reason why some of this thinking is faulty.\nA. Algan has now shown that knowing the long-range effects of\nchlorination is a worthy objective.\n400TRUDYGOVIER B. Alganis using a word in two ways.\nC. There is an error in thinking in this part.\nHere B, which is the keyed answer, does in fact seem correct.\nThe problem is that we might be able to defend A as an answer,\nand whether we can depends in part on how broadly the\nexpression \u2018faulty thinking\u2019 is interpreted, Algan does just assert\nthatfindingoutthelong-rangeeffectsofchlorinationonhuman\nbodies is worthwhile; he offers no evidence for that claim.\nAnalyzinghisargument,wecouldpointouthisinconsistentand\nstipulative use of the word \u2018demonstration\u2019. We could also point\noutthatthisclaimaboutlong-rangeeffectsisratherproblematic;\nit could even be branded as question-begging in the broader\ncontext. If thinking involves mainly reasoning, then this answer\nis out of order. However the concept of thinking underlying the\nsectionseemstobeabroaderone.Inanycase,respondentscould\nwell be confused by this potential ambiguity.\nQuestion 32. (From section four, on judging inductive\ninference to conclusions.) The background information given\nconcerns an experiment in which some ducklings, of three different\ntypes,werefedregulardiet,andsomewerefedregulardietpluscabbage\nworms. In the latter group, seventeen were dead, four were ill, and one\nwas healthy at the end of a week; in the former group, one was dead,\nthreewereill,andeighteenwerehealthy.Thequestionishowtheadded\ninformationwouldaffecttheconclusiondrawn,whichwasthatcabbage\nworms are poisonous to ducklings. Respondents are to choose between:\nIf true, this information supports the conclusion.\nIf true, this information goes against the conclusion.\nC.This information does neither.\nIt is discovered that during the original experiment the regular-\nfed ducklings had less sunlight than the worm-fed ducklings. It is\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 401 not known whether or not the difference in amount of sunshine\nwould have an effect on the health of ducklings.\nThe key states that this additional information would count\nagainsttheconclusion,because\u2018thedifferencesinsunlightmight\nexplainthedifferenceinresults.\u2019Theadvicetorespondents,that\nit is not known whether difference in sunlight affects the health\nof ducklings, is probably inserted so as to avoid respondents\nappealingtothecommonbeliefthatsunlightisgenerallyhealthy.\nUsingthisbelief,wewouldarriveatCastheanswer,orpossibly\nevenatA.(Wemightreasonthatsincesunlightmakesforhealth,\nand worm-fed ducklings die more even with more sunlight, the\ngood effects of the sun are countered by a bad effect \u2013 which\nmust be that of the worms.) The answer given seems then to\nbe correct, provided that our background beliefs about sunlight\nand health are ignored. But that may be difficult to do. Whether\nit is logically correct to ignore such fundamental background\nbeliefs in the context of inductive reasoning about health is\nquestionable.\nQuestion 45. (From section 6, on definition and assumption\nidentification.)\n\u2018What are you making with that dough?\u2019, asked Mary\u2019s father.\n\u2018Dough!\u2019, exclaimed Mary. \u2018Did you ever see anything made with\nyeast that was baked immediately after it was mixed? Naturally not,\u2019\nshesaidassheputthemixtureintotheovenimmediatelyaftermixing\nit. \u2018Therefore, it\u2019s not dough.\u2019\nOf the following, which is the best way to state Mary\u2019s notion of\ndough?\nA. Doughisamixtureofflourandotheringredients,includingyeast.\nB. Dough is a mixture of flour and other ingredients, not baked\nimmediately.\n402TRUDYGOVIER C. Dough is a mixture of flour and other ingredients, often baked in\nan oven.\nThekeyedanswerisA.Theexplanationinthekeyreads,\u2018Mary\u2019s\nreasoning is that the mixture is baked immediately, so it is not\nmade with yeast; so it is not dough. The selected definition fills\nthe gap between the subconclusion and the final conclusion.\nThe problem here is that Mary focuses on two things: the\ninclusion of yeast, and the idea that when yeast is included, if\nthe resulting mixture is put into the oven immediately, it is not\ndough. She is defining what is not dough, rather than what is\ndough, really, saying that if x contains yeast and x is baked\nimmediately, then x is not dough.

No answer says this. The \u2018right\u2019 answer requires\nthat we see Mary as offering a two stage argument, but there is\nnothing in the passage quoted to indicate that she is doing this.\nThe question is extremely confusing. The matter is made worse\nfor those familiar with baking, in that the ordinary language\nsense of \u2018dough\u2019 is much looser than Mary\u2019s. (No doubt this is\nwhy the emphasis is put on Mary\u2019s sense of the word, in the\nstatement of the question.)\nThe Cornell Level Z test seems superior to the Watson-Glaser\ntest in a number of respects. It has a wider range, including\ninductive-confirmation and explanatory reasoning, and\nsemanticmatters.Instructionsarestatedclearly\u2013withouteither\ndeviating from or obscurely trading upon standard logical\nterminology. The test has been open to expert scrutiny, and its\nauthor is sensitive to academic disputes that bear on its content.\nNevertheless, there are important criticisms to be made, even\nfromaninternalpointofview.Contestableitemsremain,despite\ngreat care. Important aspects of reasoning and argument\nevaluation essential to critical thinking are not covered by the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 403 test, even when such aspects would appear to be manageable\nwithin the restrictions of the format.\n4.Concluding Comments\nThe two most widely used critical thinking tests would seem\nrather imperfect, then, although the Cornell Level Z Test seems\nfar better than the Watson-Glaser test with regard to breadth\nand philosophical cogency of instructions. The number of\ncontestable items in either case is significant when we consider\nthe purposes for which these tests are used. These are observing\nimprovement or non-improvement in a class as a result of\nteachingandcomparingthatimprovementornon-improvement\nwith a control group; and comparing individuals\u2019 tested critical\nthinking abilities for admission or employment decisions. In\neither case, a difference of 15% in score would surely be seen as\nvery significant. And yet both tests have 15% contestable items\nand hence, a possible variation in this range that is due not to\ncritical thinking ability but to something else.\nReferring backtotheinferencelevelsdiscussed insection two\nabove,thecontestabilityofsomeitemsonthetestwillaffectnot\nonly the first inference, from the coincidence of a respondent\u2019s\nanswer with the keyed answer to his or her being able to get\nthatquestionright,butthesecondinference,fromarespondent\u2019s\ngettingsomequestionrightaccordingtothekeytohisbeingable\nto answer a related set of questions correctly.

This being the case, they will not\n404TRUDYGOVIER take it into account in generating set Q\u2019 from set Q; Q\u2019 will be\ngenerated in an unreliable way.\nAswasnoted,manyaspectsofcriticalthinkingarenotcovered\non these two tests. This is true even if we consider critical\nthinking in a fairly narrow framework, restricting ourselves to\nthe context of articulated criticism of inferences and arguments.\nIt is still more obvious, of course, if we adopt a broader\nconception of critical thinking. Many of the aspects of critical\nthinking still within the argument analysis area, such as various\nfallacies, questions regarding relevance, issues of discourse\ninterpretation,andsensesofargumentstructure,seemamenable\nto mechanical testing. And yet probably if such topics as\nrelevance and analogy had been included, the number of\ncontestable items would have increased.\nThere seems to be a dilemma here. Contestable items might\npossiblybeeliminatedfromcriticalthinkingtestsaltogether,but\niftheywere,thiswouldsurelybeatthecostofgreatrestrictionin\nthescopeofthesetests.Alreadysuchtestsnecessitaterestriction\nto short illustrations, to invented material, to fairly\nstraightforward wording, to domains where background\nknowledgeandvaluejudgmentsdonotcruciallyaffectjudgment,\nto issues that can be quickly summed up, and so on. It is likely\nthat some omissions are due not to the fact that test authors\nregard the material as irrelevant to the nature of argument and\ncriticalthinking,butbecausetheconstructionofnoncontestable\nshort-answer questions in those areas is either difficult or\nimpossible.\nIt is instructive, at this point, to compare the scope of the\nCornell Level Z Test with a recent curriculum statement by\nRobert Ennis. Ennis provides an excellent and extensive list of\nabilities that it would be desirable to cultivate in a course on\ncritical thinking. Examining this list, and comparing it closely\nwith his own test, I found many aspects not covered by the test.\nThese include the ability to identify and formulate questions;\nseeing similarities and differences in argument; identifying and\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 405 handlingirrelevance;summarizingmaterial;handlingtablesand\ngraphs; arriving at value judgments after considering\nalternatives; weighing, balancing and reaching a decision in a\nvalue context; defining a problem when one has to decide on\nan action; and presenting a position orally or in writing, using\nappropriatelogicalandrhetoricalstrategies.Theseandanumber\nofotheraspectsEnnisincludedarenotcoveredonhistest.Many\ncould not be, due to the restrictions dictated by the format or to\nthe great unlikelihood of avoiding contestable items, or both.\nThe range of the Watson-Glaser and the Z level tests seems\nnarrow. It is narrow in comparison with Ennis\u2019 admirable\ncurriculum proposal, and it is narrower still when we consider\nthebroaderpsychologicalandsocio-politicalaspectsemphasized\nby Richard Paul. Given this, the last stage of inference, from\nbeing able to do questions of the type covered on the test to\nhaving critical thinking ability in some sense general and wide\nenough to be of genuine interest and importance, will be\nquestionable. As noted earlier, this will be more questionable in\ntheaffirmativecasethaninthenegative.Ifsomeonedoeswellon\natestwithnarrowrange,thatwillnotgivegoodevidenceforhis\nhavinggeneralcriticalthinkingability;whereasifhedoespoorly\nonsuchatest,itismorelikelythathereallydoeslacktheability\n\u2013 granting, of course, the earlier stages of inference.\nThe dilemma that arises here is a perfectly obvious one. By\ngreatly narrowing the scope of tests, we might be able to\neliminate contestable items, therebystrengthening the inference\nthat what respondents do on the test reliably indicates their\nability to do an appropriately generated set of related problems\n(problems of the same type). However, by narrowing the range,\nweweakentheinferencefromtheirbeingabletodothesethings\nto their being critical thinkers. Too many aspects central to\ncritical thinking will have been omitted from the test. On the\nother hand, the scope of tests could be greatly broadened, using\nsomething like Ennis\u2019 proposed curriculum \u2013 perhaps with\ninspiringamendmentsfromRichardPaulandothers\u2013asabase.\n406TRUDYGOVIER Ifthisweredone,contestableitemswouldundoubtedlyincrease,\nand the earlier inferences would correspondingly weaken.\nIt seems to be a no-win situation. This tension is not merely\ntheresultwewouldexpectonthebasisofarmchairanalysis,but\nis corroborated by what we found in the Cornell Level Z Test.\nThetesthasbeencarefullyconstructedbyconscientiousexperts\nandisrelativelylimitedinscope;yetitstillretainsapproximately\n15% contestable items.\nA possible response to this problem is that it is apparent, but\nperhaps not real. Until people have tried hard to construct tests,\nbased on a broad range of items, with zero or very low\ncontestability, we are not in a position to conclude for certain\nthat such a thing cannot be done. One might argue that those\nwho criticize existing tests should, perhaps, be working hard to\nimprove them or to invent new ones.\nThis response raises broader questions about the role of\nmachine-gradable short-answer tests and the interests they\nserve. If we regard their role as benign or neutral, and the\ninterests they serve as legitimate, we may think that it is\nimportant to try to broaden and strengthen these tests. If, on\nthe other hand, we see the tests as an expression of a general\ndesiretosumuppersonaldifferencesinaquantitativefashion,in\nthe interests of apparently authoritative bureaucratic decision-\nmaking, we will have a quite different attitude. Why do we have\ncritical thinking tests? How much do we need them? How\nimportant is it to make them accurate?\nIf we wish to test for critical thinking, but are willing to\nrelinquish the requirement of short answer so-called objective\ntests, we could try to test ability by essays or interviews, or a\ncombination of these with short-answer tests. Such procedures\nwouldalso,ofcourse,havetheirflaws.Forinstance,interviewers\nor markers might differ in their skill or in their\ninterpretive assumptions, leading to unreliable results. A\nmajor problem with such procedures would be that of cost. The\n50-minuteshortanswertest,markablebycomputer,hasobvious\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 407 practical advantages. Society so often demands quantifiable\nresults, obtainable cheaply, in a relatively short time. Lobbying\nfor courses, programs, fellowships, and grants is facilitated if\none can appeal to results presented in this way, on the basis\nof \u2018objective\u2019 tests. Nevertheless, we have seen fundamental\nproblems with these tests.\nIs there is something rather absurd about a society that seeks\nnumbers based on short pencil-and-paper encounters to\nrepresentsuchfundamental,profound,andwide-ranginghuman\nabilities as critical thinking? Is there perhaps also something\nabsurdaboutphilosophersclaimingexpertiseincriticalthinking\nhelping to pursue this questionable ambition?\nIf critical thinking tests have serious theoretical liabilities,\nphilosophers and psychologists should not be relying on them\nfor significant group or individual decisions. Nor should they\nbe encouraging other people to do so. The supposed need for\nsuch tests comes from interests of bureaucratic efficiency and\nacademic-political lobbying, not from truly educational,\nphilosophical, or critical interests. Furthermore, as argued in\ndetail here, one is caught in a trade-off situation with these tests.\nPerhaps the way out of this dilemma is to refuse the task and\nuse what critical thinking abilities we have to resist those forces\nin society that demand a single number, obtainable after a\n50-minute computer-scorable examination, to represent critical\nthinking ability.\nNotes\nI appreciate the help I have had from Robert Ennis, Matthew\nLipman, Stephen Norris, and John McPeck in obtaining\nmaterials on which this discussion is based.\n1. These are the most widely used among college level students.\nSeveral other common tests are used mainly for younger\nstudents from fourth or fifth grade to high school level. One\n408TRUDYGOVIER is more specialized, focusing solely on students\u2019 abilities to\nappraise authoritative sounding observational statements.\nSeveral tests, including the Ennis essay style critical thinking\ntest.werereportedtometobeoutofprintbytheirpublishersin\nMarch,1985.(InthecaseoftheEnnistests,thislaterturnedout\nnot to be correct.)\n2.

Presumably they did so due to having been\nsensitized to testers\u2019 background assumptions and style of\nquestioning.\n9. It is for this reason that our judgment that keyed answers are\nuniquely correct is absolutely crucial. One may quote statistics\nuntil one is blue in the face, but any argument for the validity\nof a critical thinking test is otiose unless this initial logico-\nphilosophical condition is met.\n10. The point is emphasized in Stephen P. Norris, \u2018The Choice\nof Standard Conditions in Defining Critical Thinking\nCompetence\u2019, Educational Theory Vol. 35, no. 1 (Winter 1985),\npp. 97-107. Norris refers to recent work on deductive logic\ncompetence-which presumably would be more neutral than\ninductive, analogy, or conductive argument ability. This work\nindicatesthatlinguisticfactors,contentandcontextfactors,and\nnonlogical biases can mean that competence in basic areas of\ndeductive inferences does not transfer as logicians and\nphilosophers have traditionally expected. One may be able to\nhandle conditionals when they are about a familiar subject, but\nnot when they are about an unfamiliar one, for instance. The\nlocus classicus in this area is Jonathan St. B. T.

Robert Ennis has charitably offered this defense of the\nWatson-Glaser test.\n18. A summary of findings is given in C. T. News (Newsletter\ncirculated by the Philosophy Department. Sacramento,\nCalifornia.) Vol. 2, no. 3 (November 1983). Agreement on the\nhigherleveltestwasabout85%oninductionitems;itwaslower\nfor these items on the less advanced test. Notably, the more\nadvanced respondents were in comparison to the intended test\nlevel, the more they tended to contest keyed answers. This\nsuggests that especially competent students might be. in effect,\ndisadvantaged on such tests.\n19 The manual for the Level Z test indicates that it is the\nreliability of the person that is intended to be relevant here.\nYet \u2018believability\u2019, as used, seems to refer to the probability of\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 411 the statement itself as well \u2013 implying that one would at least\npartially base one\u2019s judgment on one\u2019s sense of how likely it\nwas that the statement was true given background knowledge.\nThough I urged this point as a respondent to the expert survey,\nit was not taken up. It might be less misleading to speak of\nthe believability of people as Ennis did when he wrote \u2018The\nBelievability of People\u2019 (Educational Forum, March 1974), pp.\n347-354). In that article, however, he quickly moves from this\nlocutionbacktospeakingofthebelievabilityofastatement,qua\nthe statement of the person described.\n20. In fact, these aspects should be relatively easy to test in the\nrequired format, and the importance of such skills is widely\nrecognized.\n21. A close comparison with Ennis\u2019 own curriculum \u2013 see note\n12 \u2013 indicates that many fallacies he himself thinks should be\ntaughtdonotappearontheCornellLevelZTest.Theseinclude\n(at least) slippery slope, bandwagon, ad hominem, post hoc,\naffirmingtheconsequent,denyingtheantecedent,strawperson,\nfaulty argument from analogy, appeal to tradition, and\nirrelevance.\n22. At many points when analyzing natural argumentation, we\nhave seen that legitimate alternative interpretations and\nappraisals are possible. Given this, it would be surprising if\nmaterial on critical thinking tests could avoid all such issues.\nExaminationofthesetestsinthischapterindicatesjustwhatwe\nshould expect: they do not.\n412TRUDYGOVIER CHAPTER 13.\nTHE SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY OF ARGUMENT\nSocial epistemology was not a major topic within philosophy when\nthis chapter was written in 1985. It came into prominence some years\nlater,emergingfromconcernsinthephilosophyandsociologyofscience\nand the careful attention to testimony of C.A.J. Coady. The conception\nofepistemicindividualismcametobequestioned,andtheoristssoughtto\nacknowledge social factors without lapsing into relativism. The notion\nthat evaluations of an argument\u2019s cogency could be relative to the\nunderstanding and beliefs of its audience, defended in this chapter,\npoints to concern about relativism in justification and hence in\nepistemology more generally. It is fair to say that such concerns persist\ntoday.\nAcrucialpoint,notalwaysobservedeveninrecenttheorizing,isthat\nacceptabilitymustbedistinguishedfromacceptance.Thelatternotionis\ndescriptive;theformerisnormative\u2013asarguedhere.Inseekingcriteria\nthat are audience-sensitive but genuinely normative, the notion of the\nuniversal audience retains its interest.

That interest is indicated here in the\ndiscussions of credibility and testimony. Given limitations in our\nexperience, expertise, and knowledge, there are many occasions when\nour acceptance of the claims of others requires that we trust them.\nIn such contexts it is not irrelevant or fallacious to take into account\npersonal characteristics bearing on their trustworthiness. The qualities\nof persons and relationships between them gain epistemic relevance.\nCommunicating reasons and arguments is a social practice.\nStandardizedPCmodelsofargumentaresomewhatmisleadinginthese\ncontexts because we need to consider not a bare proposition detached\nfrom its surroundings, but a claim as asserted in context by a person\nwhose (understood) personal characteristics are relevant to its rational\nacceptability. Within traditional topics of informal logic, such\nconsiderations bear most obviously on accounts of the fallacies of ad\nhominem, tu quoque, and authority. They are clearly important, as\nwell, in considerations about the logic and epistemology of testimony.\nThe detachability of propositional content from these and other\nfeaturesofcontextisathemeexploredbysubsequenttheoristsincluding\nAndrea Nye, Douglas Walton, Harald Wohlrapp, and Christopher\nTindale. An appreciation of the significance of credibility has been\ngreatly enhanced by Miranda Fricker\u2019sEpistemicInjusticeand work\nstemming from it, at an intersection between epistemology and social\nphilosophy.\nStandard logical treatments of argument detach premises and\nconclusionfromthesurroundingverbaldiscourse,andalsofrom\nthe social and psychological context in which that discourse\noccurs. Interpretation may require some reference to this\ncontext,ofcourse,butoncepremisesandconclusionareisolated,\ntheir acceptability and inferential relationships tend to be\nconsideredapart.Thisstrategyisappropriateformanypurposes.\nNevertheless, it is a considerable abstraction. Arguers and their\n414TRUDYGOVIER audiences are persons with emotions and interests as well as\nbeliefs, and with histories that may bear significantly on the\ncontext in which the argument occurs.\n1.Arguer\u2019s Credibility\nAn obvious aspect to consider here is that of credibility.\nCredibility, or worthiness to be believed, is something persons\naddressing an audience are normally assumed to possess.\nPersonal and social relations presume a basic underlying trust\nbetween people. In contexts of argument, this trust takes the\nformofourtacitlyassumingthatpeoplearecompetentobservers\nand witnesses, that they speak sincerely, intending to express\ntheir genuine beliefs, and that they try to support those beliefs\nwithgoodreasons.Instatingandconsideringarguments,weare\nengaged in an activity of mutual persuasion and reflection. This\nactivity requires the exchange of information and evidence and\nthecarefulconsiderationofthereasonsofothers.Ofcourse,not\nall contexts in which arguments are put forward measure up to\nthis ideal, though it is the norm of the practice. Normally, we\ngrantotherscredibility,orworthinesstobebelieved,asamatter\nof course. We presume that they are perceptually competent,\nreasonable participants in the discourse, genuinely asserting\nwhat they believe to be the case. But this standardly presumed\ncredibility may be diminished or lost. As H.H. Price put it,\nOfcoursenoonebelieveseverythingthatheistold,noreverythingthathe\nreads; still less does he always believe it with complete confidence. But in\nninecasesoutoften,wedogiveatleastsomecredencetowhatwearetold\nor what weread. There is,ofcourse,thetenthcase.1\nLogical tradition has stressed the erroneous nature of much\nreasoning from alleged defects of people to alleged substantive\nerror in their claims or arguments, and has tended to brand\nas fallacious any inference from the personal inadequacy of an\narguer or speaker to the unacceptability of that person\u2019s\nargument or claim. This stringent insistence on the separation\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 415 of the personal and the logical may have emerged because many\npeoplearesosensitivetothesocialaspectsofargumentationthat\nthey too easily allow personal characteristics to overwhelm the\ndetached consideration of premises and conclusions.\nStill, some personal features of arguers bear on their\ncredibility,andthisisrelevanttotheproperunderstandingofthe\ndynamics of argument. Recent accounts of credibility, authority,\nand the ad hominem argument have recognized these points.2\nWhen we are dependent on the authority or testimony of an\narguer in order to decide whether to accept his or her premises,\na number of personal and situational qualities are genuinely\nrelevant to that decision. The point has been emphasized by\nLawrence Hinman in a paper on ad hominem, acknowledged in\nseveral recent textbooks on practical logic, and most\ninterestingly portrayed in a recent article by John Hardwig\nentitled \u2018Epistemic Dependence\u2019. Hardwig emphasizes our\ndependence on others \u2013 especially those who are experts in\nspecialized areas \u2013 for beliefs and knowledge. He maintains that\nthis is such a pervasive feature of modern life that the epistemic\nindividualism issuing in the general advice to think for yourself\nis overly simple. Hardwig reminds readers that more is known\nthat is relevant to the truth of our beliefs than anyone could\nknow by himself or herself. The extent to which wholly\nautonomous thinking is impossible in modern life is vividly\nillustrated by Hardwig\u2019s citation of an article on particle physics\nwith ninety-nine authors.\nExperts depend on each other and, of course, non-experts\ndepend on experts. We must trust others to build up knowledge\nand beliefs. Because trust is needed, the personal qualities of\nothers are genuinely relevant to the rationality of our relying\non them. Given this dependence, there are many ad hominems\nthat permit us to withdraw our normal rational deference; such\nreferences to background information about arguers do not\nalways involve us in fallacies. They are likely to be more\nimportant and relevant in discussions with experts than with\n416TRUDYGOVIER peers.Aswehaveseenelsewhere,standardizedCriticalThinking\ntests evensometimes includesections onwhichrespondents are\nto judge which claims are less believable on the basis of aspects\nof the persons who assert those claims and their circumstances.3\nThere are two fundamentally different ways in which an\narguer\u2019s credibility may be upset so as to affect the dynamics of\nhis or her argument. These correspond to what logical tradition\ntermed the abusive ad hominem and the circumstantial ad\nhominem. In the abusive ad hominem, an attack is made on the\narguer\u2019s character or background and this attack is used,\nirrelevantly, to undermine that person\u2019s credibility and thereby\nlessen acceptance of his claims or arguments.4 In the\ncircumstantialadhominem,credibilityisattackedonthegrounds\nthat the arguer fails to practice what he preaches. These are tu\nquoque attacks; they are branded as fallacious because typically\nwhat an arguer does has no rational bearing on the truth or\nplausibility of his claims or on the merits of his inferences.\nIn effect, logical tradition requires that premises and\nconclusions be considered in detachment from the social and\npsychologicalrelationsofarguersandtheiraudiences.Tradition\nseemstopresumetheepistemicindividualismHardwigcriticizes\nin his article. The tacit model is that of the solitary thinker who\ncan check each claim for himself or herself. We often cannot\ndo this. The unsatisfying nature of this view is most apparent\nwhen we consider the long-established relevance of personal\ncharacteristics of witnesses to the acceptability of their\ntestimony in courts of law.5 The greater sensitivity of recent\naccounts to the many circumstances in which personal\ncharacteristics of arguers do bear legitimately on the\nacceptability of their premises is a substantial improvement in\nthe direction of bringing logicians\u2019 advice closer to sensible\nreasoning in law, science, and everyday life.\nTrust and confidence in others as a source of information are\ncrucial in circumstances where the audience is not\nindependentlycompetenttoappraisethepremisesandmustrely\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 417 on an arguer\u2019s statement that these are true. This often happens\nbecause the premises involve what is, in effect, testimony from\nthe arguer as to the occurrence of events in inaccessible times\nand places. It also happens when the arguer is functioning as\na kind of expert, using premises about a specialized subject in\nwhich his or her knowledge substantially exceeds that of the\naudience.Strictlogicaltraditionontheadhominemhastendedto\nignore the significance of these special circumstances in which\nan audience is epistemically dependent on an arguer.

Some are to be deplored from a logical point of\nview. But others are legitimate and point to the social dynamic\npresupposed by the normal workings of argumentative\ndiscourse.6\n418TRUDYGOVIER The presumption of trust in contexts of argument is again\nindicated when we consider the circumstantial ad hominem,\nthough matters here are more intricate. In the circumstantial ad\nhominem or \u2018tu quoque\u2018 argument, the arguer is accused of failing\nto live up to his or her own expressed principles. For example, a\nPresident criticizing terrorism might be accused of practicing it\nby proxy, or political leaders urging the public to restrain wage\ndemands might be accused of seeking high wage increases for\nthemselves. In such cases, arguers express a normative principle\naspartoftheirargument(eitherconclusionorpremise),butthen,\nthrough their own actions, indicate that their support for that\nprinciple is flawed because they do not apply it to their own\ncase.Criticsaccusethemofinconsistency:iftheinconsistencyis\ndemonstrated, the position of such arguers is seriously affected.\nYet, contrary to logical tradition, it does seem to be the case\nthat their credibility is undermined, because there seems to be\nevidencethattheydonotinafullsensesupportwhattheyassert.\nIn a recent book, Douglas Walton has discussed such cases\nat some length.7 He explains that these arguers are accused of\na special kind of inconsistency, a species of pragmatic\ninconsistency that he and John Woods have called \u2018deontic-\npraxiological\u2019 inconsistency. Such arguers say that we should do\nX,butthemselvesdoY,whereYis,inasense,contrarytoX.The\narguer\u2019s principle indicates he should do X; what he in fact does\nis correctly describable as doing Y; and doing Y amounts, in this\ncontext, to not doing X.\nWalton points out the subtle relationships which may hold\nbetween X and Y, and the room for debate as to whether there\nreally is the right kind of pragmatic inconsistency. For instance,\nsuppose that a student accuses a businessman of making\nweapons that kill innocent people in the developing world.\nSupposenextthatthebusinessmanaccusesthestudentof(byhis\nparticipation) supporting a university which, as an institution,\ninvestsfundsinsuchawayastosupportrepressivegovernments\nthat kill innocent people in the developing world. The issue of\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 419 whether the student\u2019s omission in failing to oppose this institution\nconstitutes a support for the killing of innocent people in the\ndeveloping world. Here, whether Y constitutes not X is a tricky\nquestion.\nIn other cases, the inconsistency may be obvious, but other\ncomplex questions may arise. Perhaps there are issues as to\nwhether an arguer\u2019s actions, taken as support for a principle\ncontrary to the one professed, are involuntary or are excusable.\nSome cases where pragmatic inconsistency is alleged are\ncomplex and contestable, to say the least. Walton\u2019s account is\nappropriately sensitive to these matters.\nHere, we focus on another aspect, one bearing more directly\non arguers\u2019 credibility. Suppose that a pragmatic inconsistency\nclearlydoesexist.Thispragmaticinconsistencydoesundermine\nthe arguer\u2019s credibility in some way. It shows the arguer to be\nfailing in commitment or sincerity. On Walton\u2019s account, the\ndemonstration of such an inconsistency shifts the burden of\nproof.Ifanarguercanbeshowntobepragmaticallyinconsistent\nand accordingly less than wholehearted in support for his or\nher own principle, then he or she is put on the defensive in\nthe circumstance of back-and-forth argument. Attention moves\naway from the practices initially criticized to the arguer as a\nperson, and to that person\u2019s actions or omissions. According to\nWaltonitisthenuptothearguertoshowthattheinconsistency\nis merely apparent, that he or she has changed the practice, or\nthat the practice was involuntary or excusable in the light of\ncircumstances.\nWalton discusses a number of fascinating examples.\nParticularly vivid and interesting is a book review he quotes as\nan Appendix. In this review, called \u2018The Myth of Szasz\u2019, Gordon\nLowe is reviewing a book called The Myth of Mental Illness. He\nattacks the iconclastic critic of psychiatry, Thomas Szasz.\nReviewing a number of Szasz\u2019s books, Lowe first accuses him\nof not being a sufficiently radical critic of illness and medical\npractice,onthegroundsthatSzaszwishestodisputethepatient-\n420TRUDYGOVIER doctor relationship for mental, but not physical, illness. Lowe\nadds that, despite his claims that mental illness is a myth, Szasz\nsupports therapy when the relationship between therapist and\nclientisvoluntary.ThefinalstageofLowe\u2019scriticismofSzaszis\nthathedoesnotliveuptohisprinciples.Itisatthispointthatwe\nfind atuquoqueargument.\n\u2026helauncheshisattackonpsychiatryfromauniqueandspecialposition.\nHeisanM.D.,ProfessorofPsychiatryattheStateUniversityofNewYork\nUpstateMedicalCenterinSyracuse.Heisontheeditorialboardofatleast\nfourmedicalandpsychiatricjournals,andontheboardofconsultantsofa\npsychoanalyticjournal.Thatis,heisnotonlyapracticingpsychiatristand\nateacherofpsychiatry,butaveritablepillarofthepsychiatriccommunity.\nWhat on earth can he tell his students?\u2026 If Szasz teaches in his classes\nwhat he writes in his books he guarantees that any student who follows\nhisteachingswillfailhisfinals.HowcanSzaszreconcilewhatheprofesses\nwithaprofessorship?Heseesthewholepsychiatricsubcultureas\u2018amedical\ntragedy\u2019,and\u2018amoralchallenge\u2019,insiststhatitmustbeimproved,thenadds\n\u2018but we cannot do this so long as we remain psychiatrists\u2019.

The arguer must show that he or she\nis not inconsistent, or suffer a loss of credibility. With Lowe\u2019s\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 421 attack, the burden of proof moves from the tenets of the\npsychiatricprofessionwhichSzaszhasattackedtoSzaszhimself.\nAttentionmovesfromtheoriginalargumenttothepersonofthe\narguer, because the critic has shown that the arguer apparently\ndoes not live up to his own principles. (No doubt it is this shift\nofattention,resultingfromthetuquoquemove,thatunderliesthe\nlogical tradition of branding this a fallacy of relevance.) Walton\nseems to grant that this shift to the person is appropriate and\nmakes a legitimate difference to the course of the debate.\nWalton\u2019saccountpresumes, correctlyIthink, thatthearguer\u2019s\ncredibilityhasbeenupsetbytheallegationofinconsistency.The\nburdenofproofshifts.However,howandwhythisshouldbethe\ncase needs further explanation, in virtue of the lack of relation\nbetween the arguer\u2019s behavior and the actual content of the\npremises and conclusion of the argument. If an arguer does not\nbehave as a moral principle would prescribe, this failing does\nnot show that the principle is incorrect. Walton emphasizes this\npoint.So,interestinglyenough,doesLowe.Hebeginshisreview\nof Szasz\u2019s books by granting all of his substantive criticisms of\nthe psychiatric profession.\nAt this point it is important to reflect on the differences\nbetween the circumstantial ad hominem and the abusive ad\nhominem. In context of tu quoque the audience is (typically) not\ndependent on the arguer either for his testimony or for his\nauthority. It is not the arguer\u2019s observations or personal\nexperience that are at issue.9 Nor is the arguer speaking in a\nroleasanepistemicauthority.Theissueisoneofmoralpractice.\nTo defend the idea that tu quoque is a fallacy, we would need to\nexplain why it is logically appropriate to regard an arguer who\nis pragmatically inconsistent as less credible than one who is\npragmatically consistent. The latter practices what he preaches\nandtheformer does not.Butwhydoes this makeadifference to\nthe logical merits of their arguments? That is the question.\nWalton fails to answer this question. If the burden of proof\nis shifted, as he claims, does that shift occur for good reason? I\n422TRUDYGOVIER suggestthatiftheunpracticedpreachingspertaintotheprinciple\norprinciplesusedaspremisesinanargument,thereisasensein\nwhich those premises \u2018dangle\u2019.They areexpressed. Butthereis a\nsense in which they are not endorsed by the arguer as premises\nemployed by a sincere arguer would normally be.\nTo the logician looking at premises and conclusion isolated\nfrom the context of the argument, there would seem to be no\nrelevance of the pragmatic inconsistency to the force of the\nargument. Walton notes this near the end of his book:\nOur point is that an argument should not be treated merely as a set of\npropositionssothatthearguerhimselfisentirelyexternaltotheargument.\nRather,indialectic,theargumentisdefinedasapairofsetsofpropositions,\neachindexedtoaparticipantinagameofdialogue.Thuseachparticipant\nhas a set of propositions identified as his thesis and commitment-store\n(collectively, his position). Thus a legitimate goal of criticism is the\nestablishmentofaninconsistency\u2013insomegamesanaction-theoreticsort\nofinconsistencyamong theopponent\u2019spositionpropositions.10\nThe first sentence here is the important one. Walton appears\nto recognize that when people argue, their premises and\nconclusionsarenotsuspendedinakindoflogicalspace.Rather,\nthey are asserted in a social context where people are\ncommunicating with each other. However, instead of exploring\nthesocialrelationsinvolvedassuch,itappearsthatWaltonseeks\nto reduce them. He seeks to represent them in terms of sets of\npropositions to which arguers are committed. He regards\npragmatic inconsistency as one kind of inconsistency that may\nbe shown to exist in an arguer\u2019s position, propositionally\nunderstood. This strategy ignores the normal support for\npremises that comes from their being asserted by a person\nrelating to other persons in a context presumed to involve\nsincerity and trust.\nThis approach misses the socio-personal element in rational\ndiscussion.Thisaspectcanexplainwhypragmaticinconsistency\nof the type alleged in tu quoque is such a serious problem. What\nis wrong concerns not proposition sets but the trust between\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 423 persons. When an arguer cannot be regarded as a person\ncommitted to principles asserted, it is almost as though the\narguer is lying. If these principles are conclusions, the lack of\nsincerity withwhichtheyareheld will reflect back ontheentire\nargument. The arguer appears to want to convince us of\nsomething, but it appears that that something is not sincerely\nasserted. It appears, then, that the arguer cannot, then, be fully\npersuaded of his own argument. Since this is so, we can only\npresume that he or she does not believe the premises or does\nnot find the expressed reasoning from those premises to be\nconvincing.\nWe may set out this reasoning, based on the pragmatic\ninconsistency of an arguer, in the following way:\n1. AadvocatesthatPbefollowed,whichwouldrequirehimto\ndo X.\n2. A does Y, which is tantamount to not doing X.\nSo,\n3. A is not committed to P.\nTherefore,\n4. A\u2019s advocacy of P need not be taken seriously by others.\nTherefore,\n5. Whatever reason A\u2019s audience might have for accepting P,\nthis reason does not come from A.\nTu quoque in some of its forms may be fallacious, but there\nappears to be no fallacy in this line of reasoning.11\nThe question remaining is why these considerations should\naffect our analysis of A\u2019s argument. Granting that the premises\nandconclusionexpressedwillnotberegardedasclaimsthatthe\narguer sincerely endorses, this still leaves us the possibility of\n424TRUDYGOVIER assessing those claims on their merits. It is this possibility that\ntraditional logic directs us to, in those accounts of ad hominem\nand tu quoque that emphasize the irrelevance of personal defects\nof arguers to evaluations of the validity of their arguments and\nthe truth or acceptability of propositions they assert. The move\nfrom (3) to (4) in the above argument needs a rationale.\nLogical tradition demands, in effect, that we detach\npropositions constituting premises and conclusion from the\ncontext of personal and social relations that are normally\npresupposed when there is argumentative interchange. Walton\nquestioned this logical tradition. But he is still enough within it\nto reduce his own amendments to consideration of a larger set\nof propositions. What is relevant is, I think, something broader\nyet. The purpose of argumentative exchanges is for persons to\ncommunicate information, beliefs, and opinions both in order\nto persuade others, by reason, that their beliefs and opinions\nare true or acceptable and in order to check and possibly revise\ntheir own beliefs and opinions as a result of rational criticism\nand evaluation.12 Such exchange presumes the sincerity of\nparticipants. An arguer asserting a principle he does not hold\ncannot do so in order to communicate his beliefs, because what\nheassertsisnotinthefullsenseoneofhisbeliefs.Theinsincerity\nthatweinferfrompragmaticinconsistencyupsetsthecredibility\nof the arguer because it leads us to think that he or she is not\ngenuinely participating in an argumentative exchange. The\narguer only appears to be doing so; we do not have real and\nhonest communication. Thus the framework of argument is\nupset, although the details of the content of the argument are,\nfrom an abstract point of view, left unaffected.\nWhen people appear to be arguing, we normally presume that\ntheyareinfactdoingso.Whenweattendtotheirarguments,we\ngrant their sincerity as a matter of course. But we may discover\nthat they are not sincere, and if we do so, the discourse is upset.\nIts purpose cannot be served. I suggest, then, that the shift in\nburden of proof, noted by Walton, is a result of the fact that the\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 425 arguer must seek to re-establish himself or herself as a genuine\nparticipant in argumentative discourse. He or she will typically\ndothisbyseekingtoshowthat,despitetheallegedcontradiction\nbetween behavior and stated principles, those principles are\nreally held. (The arguer may submit that the pragmatic\ncontradictionisallegedandnotreal;thatthebehaviorcriticized\nis involuntary and does not indicate the arguer\u2019s beliefs; that\nbehaviorisabouttochange;andsoon.)Suchattemptsareefforts\nto re-establish argumentative discourse by reinstating\nconditions of trust. Appearances to the contrary, the arguer is\ncommitted to what he or she says.\nTo apply this back to the provocative review of Szasz, what\neffectshouldLowe\u2019sattackonSzaszasfailingtopracticewhathe\npreacheshaveonthereaderofSzasz\u2019sworks?Asnoted,itshould\nnot lead us to conclude either that Szasz\u2019s conclusions are false\nor that his arguments are inadequate. That would be a mistake\nregardingrelevance;thatkindofirrelevanceisjustwhytradition\nbrands tu quoque a fallacy. Rather, Lowe\u2019s account should make\nthe reader wonder just what Szasz is doing in writing these\nworks. If we do not decide that Szasz\u2019s moral position is that\nof a reformer trying to work from within psychiatry, we will,\nafter Lowe\u2019s attack, no longer be able to read Szasz as an author\nfervently expressing his reforming zeal in powerful prose. Szasz\ndoes not really believe what he says, apparently \u2013 at least not\nin the full sense in which normative belief commits to action.\nThemoralpowerofhisattackwillbeundermined.Totheextent\nthat he fails to believe what he is saying, Szasz will correctly\nbe regarded as an author who appears to be offering arguments\nin order to participate in a strenuous and genuine discussion\nabout the role of psychiatry in contemporary life, but is actually\ndoing something else. (Earning royalties, or building up a list of\npublications, or gaining attention for himself, perhaps.)\nArgumentative discourse has as its purpose the mutual\npersuasive and reflective communication of beliefs.13 This\npurpose cannot be served if one or more participants is not\n426TRUDYGOVIER expressinghisgenuinelyheldbeliefs.Logicaltraditioniscorrect\nin emphasizing the irrelevance of personal commitment and\nbehavior to the abstract correctness of the principles and\npropositions put forward. But it is misleading in its suggestion\nthat bringing out pragmatic inconsistency cannot have a logical\nbearingontheacceptabilityofclaimsandtheforceofarguments.\nTherelationshipisthere,thoughitisbestunderstoodasafailing\nofframeworkratherthanspecificcontent.Theshiftinburdenof\nproofnotedbyWaltonissomethingreal,andheiscorrecttosee\nthat it requires important revisions in the traditional logicians\u2019\naccount of thetuquoquefallacy. But the shift needs explanation.\nThat explanation can be found, I suggest, in the disturbance\nof the general presumption of trust and sincerity underlying\nargument as a social institution. Personal character and\ncharacteristics really do have something to do with the force of\nargument, and that \u2018something\u2019, far from being due to incidental\npsychological or sociological eccentricities. It is founded upon\nthe very nature of argument.\n2.Acceptability, Truth, and Audience-Relativity\nAnotherareawheresocio-personalcharacteristicsbearonthe\n\u00b7 logical evaluation of arguments has to do with their audiences.\nAudiences must reason from accepted beliefs to further beliefs.\nWhat arguments they find forceful will depend on what they\nantecedently believe.14\nThis messy qualification was avoided by logical tradition,\nwhichinsistedthatinasoundargument,thepremisesweretrue.\nWhatever anybody believes, if the premises are true, they are\njust true, and if the argument is, in addition, valid, it is sound\nin an absolute and timeless sense. The problem is, though, that\nif we stipulate that people should be convinced only by those\narguments that have true premises, we would in effect be\nstipulating that in many times and places, people should not\nbe convinced by arguments at all. In fact, it would be a tough\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 427 epistemological task to show that we ourselves should often be\nconvinced by arguments, on this model.\nThe traditional account of soundness might be preserved as a\nkindofregulativeideal,butstandardsofargumentappraisalthat\nare intended to give real practical guidance will have to move\nfrom truth of premises to acceptability. Note here: acceptability\nis not to be confused with acceptance. It is a normative notion;\nacceptability is rational acceptability. Yet still, acceptability is a\nrelativenotion:acceptabilitytowhom?Theanswerbringsinthe\naudience to whom the argument is addressed.15\nRecognition of this fact pushes standards of argumentation\nin a dialectical direction, towards the context in which the\nargument occurs and the audience to which it is addressed. An\naudience is given cogent argumentation if it is given\nargumentation in which premises are rationally acceptable to\nit and are connected to the conclusion in a way that is\nappropriate.16 This conception does not remove the normative\naspects from argument evaluation, nor does it push logic and\nepistemology into the social sciences. There are norms here,\nregardingacceptabilityofpremisesandappropriacyoftheirlink\nwiththeconclusion,butthesenormsincorporatesomerelativity\nto the beliefs, knowledge, and inferential capacities of the\naudience.\nShifting away from truth in the direction of acceptability is\ndifficult for many people to accept, possibly because it is such\na substantial departure from a tradition which is so much more\nsuccinct, elegant, and tidy. To say which premises are\nnormatively acceptable to which audience and why, in detail,\nis a demanding task, whereas to insist that premises be true is\nsomething we can do finitely and neatly.\nA possible way of avoiding such relativity to audience is\nthrough the concept of the universal audience. Traditionally,\narguing to the beliefs and interests of a particular audience has\nbeenregardedasalesseractivitythanprovingsubstantiveissues\nfrom a (supposedly) independent non relative standpoint.17 If\n428TRUDYGOVIER we see argumentation as inevitably directed to some audience\nand constructed with that audience in mind, and yet wish to\npreservetheideathatsomejustificationshaveacorrectnessthat\ntranscends particular times and places, we may appeal to the\nconcept of the universal audience. This interesting notion is\nintroducedbyChaimPerelmanandOlbrechts-TytecainTheNew\nRhetoric.18 Scientific and philosophical writing is typically\nimpersonal in tone, and might be regarded as addressed to the\naudience of all attentive mature minds in all places and at all\ntimes. Much abstract writing has an ahistorical tone, as if it\nemerged from a transcendent non-earthly vantage point to\nexpressamessageforall.Thisstyleofdiscoursetendstodisguise\nthe fact that French noblemen of the seventeenth century, or\nEnglishclericsoftheeighteenth,orphilosophersinthetwentieth\ncentury are the people being addressed.\nTaken literally, the concept of a universal audience is not\nviable. The language and level of difficulty of an argument\ncannotpossiblybesuchthatitisequallyintelligibletoallmature\nadult human beings at all times and places. (Even if it could,\nmatureadultsareasubsetofallhumanbeings,andhumanbeings\nmay be a subset of intelligent creatures.) Its content too is\nembedded in the beliefs and background assumptions of\nhistoricalcontextinwhichitarises.19Questionsmakesenseonly\nin certain contexts, given particular interests and background\nassumptions. Information and structure presume background\nconcepts and knowledge. Some historical context is presumed\nfor the sense of any argument.\nThe notion of a universal audience has an important heuristic\nuse if we do not take it literally. As an arguer, one may wish to\nbroaden one\u2019s audience as much as possible. To this end, it will\nbe useful to reflect on the background presumed to understand\nthe argument. One might render some background knowledge\nexplicit to increase the accessibility to the audience. One might\nwish to have one\u2019s discourse intelligible to persons in other\ncultures or far into the future. One can try to achieve this goal.\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 429 But discourse that is literally designed for everyone does not\nexist.\nThe acceptability of premises is relative to context and audience. We\nmay broaden the notion of who is in the audience to envisage\nreaders in future generations, in other cultures, and from other\ntraditions.Buttothinkthatthisprospecteliminatesallrelativity\ntoaudiencewouldbeamistake.Premises,tobeacceptable,must\nbeacceptabletosomepersonsandthesepersonswilldeemthem\nacceptable only on the basis of some other beliefs they hold.\nA maximally universal audience would hold in common with\nthe arguer only basic logical principles and a minimal core of\ncommon sense beliefs about the existence of other people and\nmaterial objects. Though possibly transcultural, these are beliefs\nnonetheless.20\nThere is a degree of audience relativity even in inferential\nrelationships because argumentation must be intelligible to the\npersons to whom it is addressed.21 Premises cannot provide\nreasons for a conclusion if they are connected to it by a logical\nlink that no one understands. If premises deductively entailed\nthe conclusion, but could be seen to do so only by one world\nsuper-expert, the argument based on such an entailment would\nnotbecogentformostaudiences,eventhoughitwasdeductively\nvalid.\nAnother aspect of audience-relativity for inferences in\ndeductively valid argument emerges when we reflect on the\nfallacy of begging the question. This fallacy occurs when one\nor more premises is so intimately related to the conclusion that\nthe audience to whom the argument is addressed would not\naccept that premise unless it accepted the conclusion. In such a\ncase,theargumentcannotpossiblyserveitspurposeofrationally\npersuading the audience of the conclusion. Such an argument\nwill beadequate fromthepointofview ofstrict deductivelogic,\nand yet inferentially flawed, because the audience cannot\nrationally move from acceptance of the premises to acceptance\nof the conclusion.22\n430TRUDYGOVIER In non-deductive arguments, audience and context relativity\nenter in other ways. The degree of certainty required for the\nconclusion, and hence the standards for evaluating inductive or\nanalogical inferences, may vary depending on the context. The\nseriousness with which countervailing factors in conductive\narguments are considered may be similarly affected.23\nAppeals tothenotionofauniversalaudiencedonoteliminate\ntherequirementthatacogentorpersuasiveargumentisonethat\nis cogent or persuasive for a particular audience.\nNor does the curiously related concept of the self as audience.\nIn philosophical writing, particularly of the confessional type,\nan author may report deliberations and reasonings that led him\nor her to various problems, dilemmas, and conclusions. He or\nshe may write as though trying to convince the self and the self\nalone. If we took this style at its face value, we would have a\nlimiting case of an audience. The arguer and the audience seem\nto be one. But clearly, this style is one particular literary and\nrhetorical device. The self stands for a representative person in\nthe broader culture the writer addresses. The self is presumed\nto have beliefs, interests, and problems that will be of broad\nconcern, and standards of evidence and argument that will gain\ngeneral respect.\nOften, as in Descartes\u2019 writing, that representative individual\nis intended as a representative of the universal audience. Thus,\nwhat is prima facie a maximally narrow audience is intended in\nfact to be maximally broad. The self is to serve as the universal\nperson, or so the author intends. But of course such a guise,\neven when as successful as it could possibly be, does not achieve\nfull universality of audience. Any self is a culturally developed\nand informed person, necessarily not representative of mind in\ngeneral.\nLess metaphysical uses of the self as audience preserve its\nrepresentative character, but the group this self aspires to\nrepresent is typically smaller. Scientists and philosophers\nseekingtoconvincethemselvesofresultsareofcoursenotreally\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 431 interestedinconvincingjustthemselves.Theyarealsointerested\nin argumentation that will stand as rational to those in the\ncultural subgroup within which they are working. Here, the self\nrepresents an individual standing within that subculture, within\nwhich projects, problems, and standards have been developed.24\nThere is always an audience to whom argumentation is\naddressed,andthataudienceisalwaysinformedwithatradition\nof beliefs and equipped with pertinent logical norms and\nabilities. Whatever the rhetorical pretensions, it is always less\nthan universal.\nThe cogency of an argument is in some important respects\nrelative to the knowledge and beliefs of the audience to which it\nis addressed.\nArgumentation is linked importantly with justification, and\nthuswitheveryareaofphilosophyandhumanknowledge.Ifwe\nmove from truth to acceptability and from validity to a variety\nof less determinate and clearcut standards, we are allowing, in\neffect,thatjustificationisrelativetotime,place,andbackground\nbeliefs. Given a background belief that germs cannot cause\ndisease, arguments would be cogent which are not cogent in\nour own society. Within one and the same society, an argument\nmight turn out to be cogent in one context and not cogent in\nanother. Similarly, an argument might be cogent in one decade\nand not cogent in another, since its premises might first be\nrationally acceptable and later not so. Departing from tradition,\nsomefear,willleadtoall-outrelativismandintellectualanarchy.\nI submit that this alarming conclusion need not follow.\nJustification must proceed from what is already believed. This\nis true whether what is believed is based on truths of sense\nperception, elementary propositions of logic and mathematics,\nor culturally remote statements.25 In a society that holds\ndifferent beliefs from our own, argument will proceed from\ndifferent premises and on the basis of different interests and\nassumptions. But in no society is everything believed. To say\nthat different people in different contexts will ground their\n432TRUDYGOVIER arguments differently is not to say that people in a particular\ncontext can ground their argument just any way at all.\nFurthermore, justification can proceed in a number of distinct\nways. Different styles of argument will be reasonable and\nintelligible to different audiences, but for every audience there\nare limits on what can be used. There are many sources from\nwhich justification can proceed and many ways in which it can\nproceed.Butthatisnottosaythatjustanythingwilldo.Premises\nmustbestatementswhichthearguerandaudiencecanrationally\naccept, and inferences must be correct according to reasonably\nendorsed standards, intelligible to arguer and audience, and\ncapable ofproviding alevel ofcertainty adequate tothe context.\nWe can allow that an argument not cogent in one context might\nbe cogent in another without allowing that whatever people\nthink is cogent is cogent for them. Moving from acceptability\nto truth incorporates only a degree of audience-relativity.\nAcceptability is not acceptance: there is no need to reject the\ndistinction between what is in fact taken as cogent by an\naudience and what that audience ought, rationally, to take as\ncogent. Such a distinction can be drawn with the appropriate\nsensitivity to the context in which the argument is presented,\nthe beliefs of that audience, and the standards of relevance and\nrationalitythatareaccepted,whethertacitlyorovertly,asnorms\nof rationality in the broader culture in which the audience and\nthe argument appear. Baneful relativism arises only if we\nrelinquish any distinction between what is thought to be and\nwhat is.\nThis distinction with reference to relativism can be brought\nout by contrasting the accounts of Chaim Perelman and L.\nOlbrechts-Tyteca on the one hand with that of Carl Wellman\non the other. For Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca the theory of\nargumentation is an entirely descriptive enterprise. There are\nmanytypesofargumentthathavebeenusedandthatcontinueto\nbeinuse.The\u2018newlogic\u2019or\u2018newrhetoric\u2019seekstodescribethese\nwhileatthesametimedescribingconditionsinwhichaudiences\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 433 commonly find such arguments persuasive or convincing. If\naudiences are more or less moved by various features, their\nresponseisnoted;itisnotjudgedtobelogicallyorepistemically\ncorrect or incorrect. There is no attempt in this work to\narticulate and rationalize appropriate norms for the variety of\nargument types described.26\nFor Wellman, on the other hand, moving from a formalist\naccount of validity to a broader account does not entail\nrenouncingnormativejudgmentsaboutthelogicalandepistemic\nmeritsofarguments.Toincludetheconductiveandtheinductive\ngives us a better description of what is going on in natural\nargumentation than deductivism would, according to Wellman.\nYet he employs a notion of validity that retains some normative\nforce,andemphasizesthispoint.Tosaythatanargumentisvalid,\ninWellman\u2019sumbrellasenseof\u2018valid\u2019,istosaythatitisultimately\npersuasive for anyone who thinks in the normal way.27 Validity\nis a critical concept on this account. An argument which in fact\npersuades people may nevertheless not be valid, because it may\nnothavecharacteristicsenablingittoretainitspersuasivenessin\nthe long run. Its original persuasiveness may have been due to\nthe social power of the person presenting it, to an unnoticed bit\nof irrelevance, or to the limited logical acumen of the particular\ngroup to which it was addressed.\nThe notion of cogency might be developed in a somewhat\ncomparable way. To say that an argument is cogent would be\nto say not that some audience in fact has found it convincing,\nbut rather that it would be found convincing, in the long run,\nby any audience relevantly similar to the audience to whom it\nwas in fact addressed. Such an account can incorporate context\nand audience relativity without relinquishing the application of\nnorms and dropping the distinction between those arguments\nthat in fact convince people and those arguments that rightly\n(correctly, appropriately) convince people. Some analysts see a\nstark alternative between timeless, absolute, non-contextual\nstandards and no standards at all. This presumed alternative\n434TRUDYGOVIER amounts to a false dichotomy, because standards of a qualified\nand complex sort may exist.\nPerhaps an example can illustrate this point. The context is\nthatofaformallecture,byanestablishedscholar,onthetopicof\nwar and religion. The lecture has been completed. The lecturer\nstandsathislectern,inthehallofasmallartgallery.Heisatease,\nandelegantlydressed;hislecturehasbeenreceivedwithinterest;\nhis jokes appreciated. He has been introduced as person of high\ncredentials and many accomplishments. He has developed his\nthesis to the effect that the sincerely religious citizen has to\naccept a degree of violence in order to accept state-order at\nall,andthatsincerelyreligiouscitizenisthereforecontaminated\nwithsomedegreeofevil.Hehasclaimedthatthejustwartheory\ncannot, on his account, have any real meaning in the conduct\nof war. He argues that the existence of war and violence is a\npermanent tragic reality in human affairs. The account does not\ncondone war but suggests that from a religious point of view\nthere will be no moral basis for opposing it as a state activity.\nInthiscontextandagainstthisbackground,thereareanumber\nof questions from the floor. A man sitting near the back of the\ncrowded hall stands to ask a question. He is about the same age\nas the speaker (in his fifties), also well-spoken, but less formally\ndressed. He is unknown to many members of the audience and\nhas no recognized status (in this context) as an expert on war,\nreligion, or any related subject. He asks the speaker how he\nwouldapplyhisaccounttonuclearweapons,pointingoutthatin\nthe lecture, all historical references were to events prior to1945.\nThe speaker replies that his account will apply equally well to\nnuclear weapons, stating thatthereis,inhisview,nodistinction\nof kind between nuclear weapons and conventional ones. They\ndiffer only by degree, he says, because both are fundamentally\nsimilar in that they kill. Once a person is dead, he or she is\ndead and is not going to care whether the death resulted from\nnuclear weapons or conventional ones. The questioner has no\nopportunitytoreplytothesecomments,becausetherearemany\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 435 other people waiting to ask questions. The audience appears\nsatisfied with the lecturer\u2019s response.\nSuppose, as seemed likely on the actual occasion, that the\naudience has been convinced by this lecturer that there is no\ndifference, save of degree, between conventional and nuclear\nweapons. On a wholly relativistic account, we should then have\ntosaythatthelecturer\u2019sargumentwasacogentone:itconvinced\nthe audience to which it was addressed. However, a more\nqualified contextual account leaves open the possibility of\njudgingthattheargument isnotcogent,evenifitdoesconvince\nthe audience to whom it was addressed. Such a judgment must\ntake into account the knowledge available to the audience and\nthat audience\u2019s capacity and long-term tendency to recognize\npertinent norms of acceptability and relevance, and to base\nconvictions on those rather than on epistemically extraneous\nfeatures such as the socially powerful position of such a lecturer\ninsuchacontext.Asocialscientificaccountofargumentcannot\nignore such factors, but they are strictly irrelevant to its norms.\nWhen the premise and conclusion are considered as parts of\nan argument, it is entirely clear that the arguer\u2019s vocal, physical,\nand social advantages do not serve to make his premises more\nacceptable or his inferences more reasonable. The argument\noffered is not cogent. The premise that the dead do not care\nwhether they have been killed by nuclear or conventional\nweapons is not one that can be supported by reasonable\nevidence. The dead, if wholly dead, have no opinions. If they\nsurvive we have no access to those opinions. (For all we know,\nthey might well prefer death by conventional weapons to a\nnucleardeaththatcouldeliminateallsurvivingpeopleandfuture\ngenerations,iftheycareaboutusintheafterlife.)Theiropinions,\nifany,arefarfromadequatetosupportanyfinaljudgmentonthe\ndifference between the weapons since this depends on a broad\nrange of environmental effects and on numbers of victims, not\njust on the effects judged by an immediate victim, who couldn\u2019t\njudge them in any event, being dead.\n436TRUDYGOVIER Inmakingthesejudgmentsaboutthecogencyoftheargument\nwe refer to standards common in our culture and to\nconventional beliefs almost certainly accepted by this particular\naudience. Ordinary beliefs about death render the premise\nunacceptable; ordinary standards for judgments about weapons\nrender it clearly insufficient as support. Furthermore, in this\ncase, there is empirical evidence both that the speaker later\nregarded his own argument as unsatisfactory, and the audience\nwould, on reflection, have come to the same decision. The\nspeakeradmittedtomeincorrespondencethathedidnothavea\nsatisfactory view on nuclear weapons and nuclear war and thus,\nimplicitly, that he was uneasy about fully assimilating nuclear\nweapons and conventional ones. A group of adults similar to\nthe original audience in background and attitudes found the\nargument totally unconvincing, for reasons similar to those\npresented above. The questioner was not satisfied with the\nresponse: in a later conversation with me, he referred to the\nspeaker\u2019s argument in response to his question as a sophism.\nIf, as seemed to be the case, the audience found the argument\nconvincing on the occasion, this is most plausibly seen as a\nfunction of the lack of time for analysis and reflection and the\nprestigious position of the arguer.\nThus by departing from the classical model of argument\nsoundness, we are not endorsing the view that cogency reduces\nto what an audience in fact finds convincing. Rather, an\nargument is cogent for an audience if, according to standards\nthat audience would deem on reflection to be relevant, the\npremises are acceptable and in the appropriate way sufficient to\nsupport the conclusion.28 An argument may be deemed cogent\nwhen these conditions are not met, as the example here\nillustrates. When that happens it is thought to be cogent but\nis not. Thus the distinction between what seems to be and what is\npreserved.\nFor arguments, tradition has pushed us to dichotomies. Is an\nargument valid, or invalid? Is it sound or unsound? Are its\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 437 premises true or false? Even within this framework there is\nimplicitly more than a dichotomy, as it is clearly possible that\nan argument might be good in one respect (valid) but bad in\nanother(havefalsepremises),sothatwhetheritisagoodorabad\nargument is either moot, or an improper question. Results will\nnot be clearcut as they are in formal systems.29 Sometimes, the\napparently straightforward question \u2018is this a good argument or\nnot?\u2019 is too simple.\n3.The Specter of Relativism\nWhen a view that is in any sense relativistic is put forward,\nthere is always the suspicion that it will somehow undermine or\ndefeatitself.Eitheritwillapplytoitself,andwilltherebyloseits\nclaim to rationality and truth, or it will not apply to itself, and\nwilltherebyconstituteacounterexampletowhatitclaims.Many\nrecent philosophical articles dealing with varieties of relativism\nconcentrate on this line of criticism. A representative version is\nthat of Harvey Siegel, who recently put the point this way:\nAssume (radical) relativism is correct. Then the relativist position has\nstrong, indeed compelling, justification \u2013 it is a rationally justifiable\nposition. Justification involves good reasons. But good reasons cannot be\nbased on anything non-neutral or arbitrary or framework-bound, by\ndefinition of \u2018good reason\u2018. Therefore if we are justified in holding that\nrelativism is correct, there must be some non-arbitrary, neutral, absolute\nframework or ground from which we can make that judgment. Thus,\nrelativism which deniesthepossibilityofthatframework isincorrect.30\nIfrelativismis(justifiedas)true,itisfalse,andifitisfalse,itis\nfalse. Thus, it would appear, relativism is false.31\nThere are many different respects in which the appraisal of\nhuman beliefs and conventions have been said to be relative.\nWe may have relativity to cultures, cultural subgroups, or\nindividuals;relativityofperceptions,norms,orscientificbeliefs;\nrelativity of meaning, conceptual framework, or justification.\nWhat is most pertinent in the context of the theory of argument\n438TRUDYGOVIER is relativity in justification. Siegel is quoted here because he\nfocuses directly on this aspect. For any relativism that would\nentail relativity in the cogency of justifications, Siegel alleges\nself-destructive incoherence. Such an account would apply with\na vengeance to the analysis offered here.\nLet us first examine Siegel\u2019s particular argument, and then\napproachthebroaderissue.TheproblemwithSiegel\u2019sargument\nisveryobvious.Thequestionisbeggedinhisdefinitionof\u2018good\nreason\u2019. Siegel says that good reasons cannot be based on\nanything non-neutral or framework bound; in fact he regards\nany reasons that are so based as \u2018arbitrary\u2019. This is clearly a view\nthat would be opposed by anyone who saw justification as\nrelative to a framework or (as here) to the beliefs and standards\nof an audience. Such a person would have an account of good\nreasons as those that are incorporated in a central role within\nthe framework or (as here) as those that are deemed reflectively\nadequate by an audience using its own considered norms. Siegel\nbegs the question against those who have a relativistic or\ncontextual view of justification. His argument employs a notion\nof good reason which negates what they explicitly assert, and\nemploys that notion in a context in which he is trying to\ndemonstrate that what they assert is false.\nFurthermore, to deem Siegel\u2019s argument question-begging is\nentirely consistent with the current contextual account of\nargumentation. The argument is unsuitable for the audience for\nwhich it is intended, because a crucial premise is bound to be\nunacceptable to that audience. It does not just happen to be so,\nbut must be so in virtue of the very aims of the argument. The\nargument is question-begging (on any plausible account of what\nquestion-begging is), because the conclusion is that a relative\naccount of justification is false and the premise, that good\nreasons cannot be good in any relative way says, in effect, the\nverysame thing. Thus, Siegel\u2019sargument isinadequate andneed\nnot worry us further.\nHowever, this leaves the broader issue open. Does an account\nPROBLEMSINARGUMENTANALYSISANDEVALUATION 439 of argument cogency that is audience relative self-destruct, as a\nmatteroflogic?Theaccountarguedinthisandprecedingessays\nis an account about arguments \u2013 not just some, but all. Thus,\nit must apply to itself and is intended to do so. Does it refute\nitself, in expressing an audience-relative account of the cogency\nof argument and in thereby implicitly claiming for itself only\nthis, and not absolute, cogency? The many considerations here\nare offered to a particular audience and claim for themselves\ncogencyforthataudience.Theyclaimforpremisesacceptability\nto that audience, and for its judgments and inferential claims,\nforceandintelligibilityforthataudience.Icanseenoproblemin\nthis.\nThe intended audience is philosophers, linguists, and other\nstudents of natural argumentation, capable of pertinent rational\nanalysisofmaterialsinEnglishandotherEuropeanlanguages,in\nthe latter part of the twentieth century. The observations made\nare intended to be acceptable to those people, and to appeal\nto their pertinent beliefs and assumptions. Where it is deemed\nappropriate to change these, evidence is offered in the way of\nexamples, selected so as to seem interesting and familiar to the\naudience. Reasoning is put forward, designed to begin with\nstatements credible to this audience and to proceed in an\nintelligible fashion to conclusions seen as at least partially novel\ntothisgroup.Thereisnoideathattheaccountwillbeintelligible\nor acceptable to Russian astronauts, children, or physical\nscientists with no interest in natural language argumentation.\nExamples are all in English. Perhaps most natural languages\nwork in similar ways32, but some may not, and there is little in\nthe account that would preclude such a possibility.\nIt is of course understood that details of evidence and\nargumentation may be wrong. This is not at issue here. What\nis at issue is the matter of coherence. Does it make sense to\nput forward an argument that arguments hold for those-in-a-\ncontext, and not necessarily for all in all contexts? I cannot see\nany paradox here. We might derive one from an understanding\n440TRUDYGOVIER of assertion and inference in terms of absolutes, I suppose. If\nasserting a statement actually entails claiming that it is true in a\nuniversalisticsense,wehaveaparadox.However,assertionneed\nnot be understood in this way. It requires only the intention to\nconvey to others statements believed to be true or adequately\nwarranted by evidence. This is compatible with the recognition\nthat what one believes to be true might be shown, someday,\nnot to be so. What the evidence warrants today, another day\u2019s\nevidencemaynotsupport.Butforallthat,today\u2019sargumentmay\nbe cogent, and correctly defended as such.\nNotes\n1.H.H.Price,Belief.(London:GeorgeAllenandUnwin,1969),p.\n113.
