These types of\nlearning opportunities focus on developing knowledge, skills, self-awareness, and abilities needed to lead effectively.\nJust as not all people are born with the ability or desire to play soccer like Zinedine Zidane or sing like Luciano Pavarotti, not all people\nare born with the ability to lead. Personal traits and behavioral dispositions can help or hinder a person's leadership effectiveness. While\nthese are difficult to change, leadership is a set of behaviors and practices that can be learned through effort and experience.\nLeadership traits: Leadership traits can be broken down into 6 categories:\nCognitive Capacities, Dispositional Attributes, Motives/Values, Social Capacities,\nProblem Solving Skills, Expertise & Knowledge.\nSuccessful leadership development is the result of three things:\nIndividual learner characteristics, including willingness and ability to learn\nThe quality and nature of the leadership development program, including its structure and content\nOpportunities to practice new skills and receive performance feedback\nMethods of Leadership Development\nLeader development takes place through multiple mechanisms: formal instruction, developmental job assignments, 360-degree feedback,\nexecutive coaching, and self-directed learning. These approaches may occur independently but are more effective in combination.\nFormal Training\nOrganizations often offer formal training programs to their leaders. Traditional styles provide leaders with required knowledge and skills\nin a particular area using coursework, practice, \"overlearning\" with rehearsals, and feedback (Kozlowski, 1998). This traditional lecture-\nbased classroom training is useful; however, its limitations include the question of a leader's ability to transfer the information from a\ntraining environment to a work setting.\nDevelopmental Job Assignment\nFollowing formal training, organizations can assign leaders to developmental jobs that target the newly acquired skills. A job that is\ndevelopmental is one in which leaders learn, undergo personal change, and gain leadership skills resulting from the roles, responsibilities,\nand tasks involved in that job. Developmental job assignments are one of the most effective forms of leader development. A \"stretch\" or\ndevelopmental assignment challenges leaders' new skills and pushes them out of their comfort zone to operate in a more complex\nenvironment, one that involves new elements, problems, and dilemmas to resolve.\n360-Degree Feedback\nThe 360-degree feedback approach is a necessary component of leader development that allows leaders to maximize learning\nopportunities from their current assignment. It systematically provides leaders with perceptions of their performance from a full circle of\nviewpoints, including subordinates, peers, superiors, and the leader's own self- assessment. With information coming from so many\ndifferent sources, the messages may be contradictory and difficult to interpret. However, when several different sources concur on a\nsimilar perspective, whether a strength or weakness, the clarity of the message increases. For this mechanism to be effective, the leader\nmust accept feedback and be open and willing to make changes. Coaching is an effective way to facilitate 360-degree feedback and help\neffect change using open discussion.\nCoaching\nLeadership coaching focuses on enhancing the leader's effectiveness, along with the effectiveness of the team and organization. It\ninvolves an intense, one-on-one relationship aimed at imparting important lessons through assessment, challenge, and support. Although\nthe goal of coaching is sometimes to correct a fault, it is used more and more to help already successful leaders move to the next level of\nincreased responsibilities and new and complex challenges. Coaching aims to move leaders toward measurable goals that contribute to\nindividual and organizational growth.\nSelf-directed Learning\nUsing self-directed learning, individual leaders teach themselves new skills by selecting areas for development, choosing learning\navenues, and identifying resources. This type of development is a self-paced process that aims not only to acquire new skills but also to\ngain a broader perspective on leadership responsibilities and what it takes to succeed as a leader.\nLeadership Development Models\nMcCauley, Van Veslor, and Ruderman (2010) described a two-part model for developing leaders. The first part identifies three elements\nthat combine to make developmental experiences stronger: assessment, challenge, and support. Assessment lets leaders know where they\nstand in areas of strengths, current performance level, and developmental needs. Challenging experiences are ones that stretch leaders'\nability to work outside of their comfort zone, develop new skills and abilities, and provide important opportunities to learn. Support\u2014\nwhich comes in the form of bosses, co-workers, friends, family, coaches, and mentors\u2014enables leaders to handle the struggle of\ndeveloping.\nThe second part of the leader-development model illustrates that the development process involves a variety of developmental\nexperiences and the ability to learn from them. These experiences and the ability to learn also have an impact on each other: leaders with\na high ability to learn from experience will seek out developmental experiences, and through these experiences leaders increase their\nability to learn.\nThe leader-development process is rooted in a particular leadership context, which includes elements such as age, culture, economic\nconditions, population gender, organizational purpose and mission, and business strategy. This environment molds the leader\ndevelopment process. Along with assessment, challenge and support, leadership contexts are important aspects of the leader-\ndevelopment model.\nGeneral Electric Model of Leadership Development\nAnother well-known model of leadership development is used by the General Electric Corporation. Managers with high potential are\nidentified early in their careers. Their development is monitored and planned to include a variety of job placements to develop skills and\nexperience, a rigorous performance-evaluation process, and formal training programs at the corporate leadership center in Crotonville,\nNew York. For top managers, the CEO leads some of the training; the CEO also reviews performance evaluations for high-potential\nmanagers during site visits to the various subsidiary divisions.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
