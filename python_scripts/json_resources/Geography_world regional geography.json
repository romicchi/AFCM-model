It might seem like a simple enough term to define. In middle school or high\nschool, your answer might have been something to do with the study of maps, of where things\nwere located in the world. In fact, much of primary and secondary school geography is explicitly\nfocused on the where, answering questions like where a particular country is located, what a\ncountry\u2019s capital is, and where major landforms are located. Just as simple arithmetic operations\nform the backbone of mathematics as a discipline, these kinds of questions are foundational\nto geographic study. However, one wouldn\u2019t likely define math as the study of calculators or of\nmultiplication tables.Similarly, thereismuchmoretogeography andgeographic inquiry thanthe\nstudy of maps.\nGeographers seek to answer both the \u201cwhere\u201d and the \u201cwhy.\u201d Simply knowing where a country\nis located is certainly helpful, but geographers dig deeper: why is it located there? Why does it\nhaveaparticularshape,andhowdoesthisshapeaffecthowitinteractswithitsneighborsandits\naccess to resources? Why do the people of the country have certain cultural features? Why does\nthecountryhaveaspecificstyleofgovernment?Thelistgoesonandon,andasyoumightnotice,\nincorporates a variety of historical, cultural, political, and physical features. This synthesis of the\nphysical world and human activity is at the heart of the regional geographic approach.\n3 4 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nTheterm\u201cgeography\u201dcomesfromtheGreektermgeomeaning\u201ctheearth\u201dandgraphiameaning\n\u201cto write,\u201d and many early geographers did exactly that: they wrote about the world. Ibn Battuta,\nfor example, was a scholar from Morocco and traveled extensively across Africa and Asia in the\n14th century CE. Eratosthenes is commonly considered to be the \u201cFather of Geography,\u201d and in\nfact, he quite literally wrote the book on the subject in the third century BCE. His three-volume\ntext, Geographica, included maps of the entire known world (see Figure 1.1), including different\nclimate zones, the locations of hundreds of different cities, and a coordinate system. This was a\nrevolutionaryandhighlyregardedtext,especiallyforthetimeperiod.Eratosthenesisalsocredited\nas the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Many early geographers, like\nEratosthenes,wereprimarilycartographers,referringtopeoplewhoscientificallystudyandcreate\nmaps,andearlymaps,suchasthoseusedinBabylon,Polynesia,andtheArabianPeninsula,were\noftenusedfornavigation.IntheMiddleAges,asacademicinquiryinEuropedeclinedwiththefall\noftheRomanEmpire,MuslimgeographerMuhammadal-Idrisicreatedoneofthemostadvanced\nmaps of pre-modern times, inspiring future geographers from the region.\nFigure 1.1: Reconstruction of Eratosthenes\u2019 Map of the Known World, c. 194 BCE (\u00a9\nE.

Bunbury, A History of Ancient Geography among the Greeks and Romans from\nthe Earliest Ages till the Fall of the Roman Empire, 1883, Public Domain)\nGeographytoday,thoughusingmoreadvancedtoolsandtechniques,drawsonthefoundations\nlaid by these predecessors. What unites all geographers, whether they are travelers writing\nabout the world\u2019s cultures or cartographers mapping new frontiers, is an attention to the spatial\nperspective. As geographer Harm deBlij once explained, there are three main ways to look at\nthe world. One way is chronologically, as a historian might examine the sequence of world\nevents.Asecondwayissystematically,asasociologistmightexplorethesocietalsystemsinplace\nthat help shape a given country\u2019s structures of inequality. The third way is spatially, and this is\nthe geographic perspective. Geographers, when confronted with a global problem, immediately\nask the questions \u201cWhere?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d Although geography is a broad discipline that includes\nquantitative techniques like statistics and qualitative methods like interviews, all geographers\nshare this common way of looking at the world from a spatial perspective. INTRODUCTION 5\n1.2 THE SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE\nAt the heart of the spatial perspective is the question of \u201cwhere,\u201d but there are a number of\ndifferent ways to answer this question. Relative location refers to the location of a place relative\nto other places, and we commonly use relative location when giving directions to people. We\nmight instruct them to turn \u201cby the gas station on the corner,\u201d or say that we live \u201cin the dorm\nacrossfromthefountain.\u201dAnotherwaytodescribeaplaceisbyreferringtoitsabsolutelocation.\nAbsolutelocationreferencesanexactpointonEarthandcommonlyusesspecificcoordinateslike\nlatitude and longitude. Lines of latitude and longitude are imaginary lines that circle the globe\nandformthegeographiccoordinatesystem(seeFigure1.2).Linesoflatituderunlaterally,parallel\nto the equator, and measure distances north or south of the equator. Lines of longitude, on the\nother hand, converge at the poles and measure distances east and west of the prime meridian.\nFigure 1.2: Lines of Latitude and Longitude (\u00a9 Djexplo, Wikipedia Commons, CC0 1.0)\nEvery place on Earth has a precise location that can be measured with latitude and longitude.\nThe location of the White House in Washington, DC, for example, is located at latitude 38.8977\n\u00b0Nandlongitude77.0365\u00b0W.Absolutelocationmightalsorefertodetailslikeelevation.TheDead\nSea, located on the border of Jordan and Israel, is the lowest location on land, dipping down to\n1,378 feet below sea level.\nHistorically, most maps were hand-drawn, but with the advent of computer technology came\nmore advanced maps created with the aid of satellite technology. Geographic information\nscience(GIS),sometimesalsoreferredtoasgeographicinformationsystems,usescomputersand\nsatellite imagery to capture, store, manipulate, analyze,manage, and present spatial data. GIS\nessentially uses layers of information and is often used to make decisions in a wide variety of\ncontexts. An urban planner might use GIS to determine the best location for a new fire station, 6 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nwhile a biologist might use GIS to map the migratory paths of birds. You might use GIS to get\nnavigation directions from one place to another, layering place names, buildings, and roads.\nOne difficulty with map-making, even when using advanced technology, is that the earth is\nroughlyaspherewhilemapsaregenerallyflat.WhenconvertingthesphericalEarthtoaflatmap,\nsomedistortion always occurs. Amap projection ,orarepresentation ofEarth\u2019s surface onaflat\nplane, always distorts at least one of these four properties: area, shape, distance, and direction.\nSome maps preserve three of these properties, while significantly distorting another, while other\nmaps seek to minimize overall distortion but distort each property somewhat. So which map\nprojection is best? That depends on the purpose of the map. The Mercator projection , while\nsignificantly distorting the size of places near the poles, preserves angles and shapes, making it\nideal for navigation (seeFigure 1.3).\nFigure 1.3: Mercator Projection (\u00a9 Daniel R. Strebe, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThe Winkel tripel projection is so-named because its creator, Oswald Winkel, sought to minimize\nthree kinds of distortion: area, direction, and distance (see Figure 1.4). It has been used by the\nNational Geographic Society since 1998 as the standard projection of world maps. INTRODUCTION 7\nFigure 1.4: Winkel Tripel Projection (\u00a9 Daniel R. Strebe, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nWhenrepresentingtheEarthonamanageable-sizedmap,theactualsizeoflocationisreduced.\nScale is the ratio between the distance between two locations on a map and the corresponding\ndistance on Earth\u2019s surface. A 1:1000 scale map, for example, would mean that 1 meters on the\nmap equals 1000 meters, or 1 kilometer, on Earth\u2019s surface. Scale can sometimes be a confusing\nconcept for students, so it\u2019s important to remember that it refers to a ratio. It doesn\u2019t refer to\nthe size of the map itself, but rather, how zoomed in or out the map is. A 1:1 scale map of your\nroom would be the exact same size of your room \u2013 plenty of room for significant detail, but hard\nto fit into your glove compartment. As with map projections, the \u201cbest\u201d scale for a map depends\non what it\u2019s used for. If you\u2019re going on a walking tour of a historic town, a 1:5,000 scale map is\ncommonlyused.Ifyou\u2019reageographystudentlookingatamapoftheentireworld,a1:50,000,000\nscale map would be appropriate. \u201cLarge\u201d scale and \u201csmall\u201d scale refer to the ratio, not to the size\nofthelandmassonthemap.1dividedby5,000is0.0002,whichisalargernumberthan1divided\nby 50,000,000 (which is 0.00000002). Thus, a 1:5,000 scale map is considered \u201clarge\u201d scale while\n1:50,000,000 is considered \u201csmall\u201d scale.\nAll maps have a purpose, whether it\u2019s to guide sailing ships, help students create a more\naccurate mental map of the world, or tell a story. The map projection, color scheme, scale, and\nlabels are all decisions made by the mapmaker. Some argued that the widespread use of the\nMercator projection, which made Africa look smaller relative to North America and Eurasia, led\npeople to minimize the importance of Africa\u2019s political and economic issues. Just as texts can be\ncritiqued for their style, message, and purpose, so too can maps be critiqued for the information\nand message they present.\nThe spatial perspective, and answering the question of \u201cwhere,\u201d encompasses more than just\nstatic locations on a map. Often, answering the question of \u201cwhere\u201d relates to movement across 8 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nspace.Diffusionreferstothespreadingofsomethingfromoneplacetoanother,andmightrelate\ntothephysicalmovementofpeopleorthespreadofdisease,orthediffusionofideas,technology,\nor other intangible phenomena. Diffusion occurs for different reasons and at different rates. Just\nasstaticfeaturesofcultureandthephysicallandscapecanbemapped,geographerscanalsomap\nthe spread of various characteristics or ideas to study how they interact and change.\n1.3 CORE AND PERIPHERY\nOnewayofconsideringthelocationofplacesrelativetooneanotherisbyexaminingtheirspatial\ninteraction. In a given region, there is generally a core area, sometimes known as the central\nbusiness district (CBD) and a hinterland, a German term literally meaning \u201cthe land behind\u201d (see\nFigure 1.5). The hinterland is more sparsely populated than the core and is often where goods\nsold in the core are manufactured. It might include rural farmland, for example.\nFigure 1.5: The Core and the Hinterland (Figure by author, Images courtesy of Espresso Addict, Wikimedia\nCommons; Mike \u2013 Flickr; Pam Brophy \u2013 Wikimedia Commons; CC BY-SA)\nThe core, on the other hand, is the commercial focus for the area where most goods and\nservices are exchanged. The hinterland relies on the central city to sell its goods, but similarly the\ncity relies on the hinterland to produce raw materials. Consider where the hinterland is located\naround your closest city; the hinterland is characteristically rural, while the core is urban. All\ncountries contain core areas and hinterlands.\nGlobally, we can apply the hinterland-city model to an understanding of a global core and\na global periphery (see Figure 1.6). The core areas are places of dominance, and these areas\nexert control over the surrounding periphery. Core areas are typically more developed and\nindustrialized whereas the periphery is more rural and generally less developed. Unlike the\ninteractions between the city and the hinterland, economic exchange between the core and\nperiphery is characteristically one-sided, creating wealth for the core and patterns of uneven\ndevelopment. However, these interactions do contribute to economic stability in the periphery.\nSome argue that it benefits the core countries to keep the periphery peripheral; in other words,\nif the periphery can remain underdeveloped, they are more likely to sell cheap goods to the\ncore. This generates more wealth for core areas and contributes to their continued influence and\neconomic strength.

As regional geographers, we can dig deeper and explore both\nthephysicalandhumancharacteristicsthatmakeaparticularplaceunique.Geographersexplore\na wide variety of spatial phenomena, but the discipline can roughly be divided into two branches:\nphysical geography and human geography. Physical geography focuses on natural features and\nprocesses, such as landforms, climate, and water features. Human geography is concerned with\nhumanactivity,suchasculture,language,andreligion.However,thesebranchesarenotexclusive.\nYou might be a physical geographer who studies hurricanes, but your research includes the\nhuman impact from these events. You might be a human geographer who studies food, but your\ninvestigationsincludetheecologicalimpactofagriculturalsystems.Regionalgeographytakesthis\nholistic approach, exploring both the physical and human characteristics of the world\u2019s regions.\nMuchofEarth\u2019sphysicallandscape,frommountainstovolcanoestoearthquakestovalleys,has\nresulted from the movement of tectonic plates. As the theory of plate tectonics describes, these\nrigid plates are situated on top of a bed of molten, flowing material, much like a cork floating in a\npotofboilingwater.Therearesevenmajortectonicplatesandnumerousminorplates(seeFigure\n1.7). 10 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.7: Map of Global Tectonic Plate Boundaries (United States Geological Survey, Public Domain)\nWhere two tectonic plates meet is known as a plate boundary and boundaries can interact in\nthreedifferentways(seeFigure1.8).Wheretwoplatesslidepastoneanotheriscalledatransform\nboundary.TheSanAndreasFaultinCaliforniaisanexampleofatransformboundary.Adivergent\nplate boundary is where two plates slide apart from one another.

Here, deep, under-ocean trenches can form. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\nand tsunami occurred because of a subducting plate boundary off the west coast of Sumatra,\nIndonesia. INTRODUCTION 11\nFigure 1.8: Types of Tectonic Plate Boundaries (United States Geological Survey, Public Domain)\nInteraction between tectonic plates and historical patterns of erosion and deposition have\ngenerated a variety of landforms across Earth\u2019s surface. Each of the world\u2019s regions has\nidentifiable physical features, such as plains, valleys, mountains, and major water bodies.\nTopographyreferstothestudyoftheshapeandfeaturesofthesurfaceoftheEarth.Areasofhigh\nreliefhavesignificantchangesinelevationonthelandscape,suchassteepmountains,whileareas\nof low relief are relatively flat.\nAnother key feature of Earth\u2019s physical landscape is climate. Weather refers to the short-term\nstate of the atmosphere. We might refer to the weather as partly sunny or stormy, for example.\nClimate, on the other hand, refers to long-term weather patterns and is affected by a place\u2019s\nlatitude, terrain, altitude, and nearby water bodies. Explained another way, \u201cweather\u201d is what\nyou\u2019re wearing today while \u201cclimate\u201d is all the clothes in your closet. Geographers commonly use\nthe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system to refer to the major climate zones found in the world\n(seeFigure 1.9). 12 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.9: World Map of K\u00f6ppen Climate Classifications (\u00a9 Ali Zifan, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)\nEach climate zone in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system is assigned a letteredcode,\nreferring to the temperature and precipitation patterns found in the particular region. Climate\nvaries widely across Earth. Cherrapunji, India, located in the Cwb climate zone, receives over\n11,000 mm (400 in) of rain each year. In contrast, the Atacama Desert (BWk), situated along the\nwestern coast of South America across Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, typically receives only\naround 1 to 3 mm (0.04 to 0.12 in) of rain each year.\nEarth\u2019s climate has gone through significant changes historically, alternating between long\nperiods of warming and cooling. Since the industrial revolution in the 1800s, however, global\nclimate has experienced a warming phase. 95 percent of scientists agree that this global climate\nchange has resulted primarily from human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse\ngases like carbon dioxide (see Figure 1.10). 17 of the 18 warmest years ever recorded have\noccurred since 2000. Overall, this warming has contributed to rising sea levels as the polar ice\ncapsmelt,changingprecipitationpatterns,andtheexpansionofdeserts.Theresponsestoglobal\nclimate change, and the impacts from it, vary by region. INTRODUCTION 13\nFigure 1.10: Mean Land-Ocean Surface Temperature Index, 1880 to Present (NASA, Public Domain)\n1.5 THE HUMAN SETTING\nThe physical setting of the world\u2019s places has undoubtedly influenced the human setting, just\nas human activities have shaped the physical landscape. There are currently around 7.4 billion\npeople in the world, but these billions of people are not uniformly distributed. When we consider\nwhere people live in the world, we tend to cluster in areas that are warm and are near water and\navoid places that are cold and dry. As shown in Figure 1.11, there are three major population\nclusters in the world: East Asia, South Asia, and Europe. 14 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.11: Map of Global Population Clusters (Derivative work from original by Cocoliras, Wikimedia Commons)\nJust as geographers can discuss \u201cwhere\u201d people are located, we can explore \u201cwhy\u201d population\ngrowth is occurring in particular areas. All of the 10 most populous cities in the world are located\nin countries traditionally categorized as \u201cdeveloping.\u201d These countries typically have high rates of\npopulation growth. A population grows, quite simply, when more people are born than die. The\nbirth rate refers to the total number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year. In 2012, the\naverage global birth rate was 19.15 births per 1,000 people.\nSubtracting the death rate from the birth rate results in a country\u2019s rate of natural increase\n(RNI). For example, Madagascar has a birth rate of 32.9 per 1,000 (as of 2017) and a death rate of\n6.19per1,000.32.9minus6.19is26.71per1,000.Ifyoudividetheresultby10,you\u2019dget2.671per\n100, or 2.671 percent. In essence, this means that Madagascar\u2019s population is increasing at a rate\nof2.671percentperyear.Thenaturalincreaseratedoesnotincludeimmigration.Somecountries\ninEurope,infact,haveanegativenaturalincreaserate,buttheirpopulationcontinuestoincrease\ndue to immigration.\nThe birth rate is directly affected by the total fertility rate (TFR), which is the average number\nof children born to a woman during her child-bearing years (see Figure 1.12). In developing\ncountries, the total fertility rate is often 4 or more children, contributing to high population\ngrowths. In developed countries, on the other hand, the total fertility rate may be only 1 or 2\nchildren, which can ultimately lead to population decline. INTRODUCTION 15\nFigure 1.12: Map of Countries by Fertility Rate, 2015 (\u00a9 Our World in Data, CC BY-SA)\nA number of factors influence the total fertility rate, but it is generally connected to a country\u2019s\noveralllevelofdevelopment. Asacountrydevelops andindustrializes, itgenerally becomesmore\nurbanized. Children are no longer needed to assist with family farms, and urban areas might\nnot have large enough homes for big families. Women increasingly enter the workforce, which\ncan delay childbearing and further restrict the number of children a family desires. Culturally, a\nshift occurs as industrialized societies no longer value large family sizes. As women\u2019s education\nincreases,womenareabletotakecontroloftheirreproductiverights.Contraceptiveusebecomes\nmore widespread and socially acceptable.\nThis shift in population characteristics as a country industrialized can be represented by the\ndemographic transition model (DTM) (see Figure 1.13). This model demonstrates the changes\nin birth rates, death rates, and population growth over time as a country develops. In stage one,\nduring feudal Europe, for example, birth rates and death rates were very high. Populations were\nvulnerable to drought and disease and thus population growth was minimal. No country remains\ninstageonetoday.Instagetwo,adeclineindeathratesleadstoariseinpopulation.Thisdecline\nindeathratesoccurredasaresultofagriculturalproductivityandimprovementsinpublichealth.\nVaccines, for example, greatly reduced the mortality from childhood diseases. 16 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.13: The Demographic Transition Model (Figure by author)\nStage two countries are primarily agricultural, and thus there is a cultural and historical\npreference for large families, so birth rates remain high. Most of Sub-Saharan Africa is in stage\ntwo. In stage three, urbanization and increasing access to contraceptives leads to a decline in the\nbirth rate. As country industrializes, women enter the workforce and seek higher education. The\npopulationgrowthbeginstoslow.MuchofMiddleandSouthAmericaaswellasIndiaareinstage\nthree.\nIn stage four, birth rates approach the death rates. Women have increased independence as\nwell as educational and work opportunities, and families may choose to have a small number of\nchildren or none at all. Most of Europe as well as China are in stage four. Some have proposed\na stage five of the demographic transition model. In some countries, the birth rate has fallen\nbelow the death rate as families choose to only have 1 child. In these cases, a population will\ndecline unless there is significant immigration. Japan, for example, is in stage five and has a total\nfertility rate of 1.41. Although this is only a model, and each country passes through the stages of\ndemographic transition at different rates, the generalized model of demographic transition holds\ntrue for most countries of the world.\nAs countries industrialize and become more developed, they shift from primarily rural\nsettlements to urban ones. Urbanization refers to the increased proportion of people living in\nurban areas. As people migrate out of rural, agricultural areas, the proportion of people living in\ncities increases. As people living in cities have children, this further increases urbanization. For\nmost of human history, we have been predominantly rural. By the middle of 2009, however, the\nnumber of people living in urban areas surpassed the number of people living in rural areas for INTRODUCTION 17\nthe first time. In 2014, 54 percent of the world\u2019s population lived in urban areas. This figure is\nexpected to increase to 66 percent by 2050.\nThe number of megacities, cities with 10 million people or more, has also increased. In 1990,\nthere were 10 megacities in the world. In 2014, there were 28 megacities. Tokyo-Yokohama is the\nlargest metropolitan area in the world with over 38 million inhabitants.\n1.6 THE WORLD\u2019S REGIONS\nThe world can be divided into regions based on human and\/or physical characteristics. Regions\nsimply refer to spatial areas that share a common feature. There are three types of regions:\nformal, functional, and vernacular. Formal regions, sometimes called homogeneous regions,\nhaveatleastonecharacteristicincommon.Amapofplanthardinessregions,asinFigure1.14,for\nexample,dividestheUnitedStatesintoregionsbasedonaverageextremetemperatures,showing\nwhich areas particular plants will grow well. This isn\u2019t to say that everywhere within a particular\nregion will have the same temperature on a particular day, but rather that in general, a region\nexperiences the same ranges of temperature.Other formal regions might include religious or\npolitical affiliation, agricultural crop zones, or ethnicity. Formal regions might also be established\nby governmental organizations, such as the case with state or provincial boundaries.\nGlobes with lines of latitude and longitude labeled\nFigure 1.14: Map of Plant Hardiness Zones in the United States (USDA, Public Domain)\nFunctional regions, unlike formal regions, are not homogenous in the sense that they do\nnot share a single cultural or physical characteristic. Rather, functional regions are united by a\nparticular function, often economic. Functional regions are sometimes called nodal regions and\nhaveanodalarrangement,withacoreandsurroundingnodes.Ametropolitanarea,forexample,\noftenincludesacentralcityanditssurroundingsuburbs.Wetendtothinkoftheareaasa\u201cregion\u201d\nnot because everyone is the same religion or ethnicity, or has the same political affiliation, but\nbecause it functions as a region. Los Angeles, for example, is the second-most populous city in\nthe United States. However, the region of Los Angeles extends far beyond its official city limits as\nshow in Figure 1.15. In fact, over 471,000 workers commute into Los Angeles County from the\nsurroundingregioneveryday.LosAngeles,aswithallmetropolitanareas,functionseconomically\nasasingleregionandisthusconsideredafunctionalregion.Otherexamplesoffunctionalregions\ninclude church parishes, radio station listening areas, and newspaper subscription areas. 18 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.15: Map of Los Angeles Metro Area (\u00a9\nKmusser, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nVernacular regions are not as well-defined as formal or functional regions and are based on\npeople\u2019s perceptions. The southeastern region of the United States is often referred to as \u201cthe\nSouth,\u201d but where the exact boundary of this region is depends on individual perception (see\nFigure 1.16). Some people might include all of the states that formed the Confederacy during\nthe Civil War. Others might exclude Missouri or Oklahoma. Vernacular regions exist at a variety\nof scales. In your hometown, there might be a vernacular region called \u201cthe west side.\u201d\nInternationally, regions like the Midlands in Britain or the Swiss Alps are considered vernacular.\nSimilarly \u201cthe Middle East\u201d is a vernacular region. It is perceived to exist as a result of religious\nand ethnic characteristics, but people wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree on which countries to include.\nVernacularregionsarerealinthesensethatourperceptionsarereal,buttheirboundariesarenot\nuniformly agreed upon. INTRODUCTION 19\nFigure 1.16: Map of the US \u201cSouth\u201d Vernacular Region (\u00a9 Qz10, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n3.0)\nAs geographers, we can divide the world into a number of different regions based upon formal\ncriteria and functional interaction. However, there is a matter of perception, as well. We might\ndivide the world based on landmasses, since landmasses often share physical and cultural\ncharacteristics. Sometimes water connects people more than land, though. In the case of Europe,\nfor example, the Mediterranean Sea historically provided economic and cultural links to the\nsurroundingcountriesthoughweconsiderthemtobethreeseparatecontinents.Creatingregions\ncan often be a question of \u201clumpers and splitters;\u201d who do you lump together and who do you\nsplit apart? Do you have fewer regions united by only a couple characteristics, or more regions\nthat share a great deal in common?\nThis text takes a balanced approach to \u201clumping and splitting,\u201d identifying nine distinct world\nregions (see Figure 1.17). These regions are largely vernacular, however. Where does \u201cMiddle\u201d\nAmerica end and \u201cSouth\u201d America begin, and why is it combined into a single region? Why is\nPakistan, a predominantly Muslim country, characterized as \u201cSouth\u201d Asia and not \u201cSouthwest\u201d\nAsia? Why is Russia its own region? You might divide the world into entirely different regions,\nmaybe seven based on the continents, or just two: the \u201ccore\u201d and the \u201cperiphery.\u201d These nine\nregions are not universally agreed-upon; they are simply foundations for discussing the different\nareas of the world. 20 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.17: Map of World Regions (Image adpated from Cogito ergo sumo, Wikimedia Commons)\nFurthermore, while it might seem like there are clear boundaries between the world\u2019s regions,\nin actuality, where two regions meet are zones of gradual transition. These transition zones are\nmarked by gradual spatial change. Moscow, Russia, for example, is quite similar to other areas\nof Eastern Europe, though they are considered two different regions on the map. Were it not for\nthe Rio Grande and a large border fence dividing the cities of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez,\nMexico, you might not realize that this metropolitan area stretches across two countries and\nworldregions.Evenwithinregions,countrybordersoftenmarkspacesofgradualtransitionrather\nthan a stark delineation between two completely different spaces. The border between Peru and\nEcuador, for example, is quite relaxed as international borders go and residents of the countries\ncan move freely across the boundary to the towns on either side (seeFigure 1.18).\nSign welcoming people entering Peru from Ecuador along a busy street\nFigure 1.18: Sign Welcoming People Entering Peru from Ecuador (\u00a9 Vanished_user_j123kmqwfk56jd, Wikimedia\nCommons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\n1.7 SUB-DISCIPLINES OF GEOGRAPHY\nGeography has two primary branches, physical and human geography, but numerous sub-\ndisciplines,manyofwhichincludebothphysicalandhumanelements.Furthermore,aswithworld\nregions,it\u2019softendifficulttomakepreciseboundariesbetweenfieldsofstudy.Ageographermight\nbe a human geographer who specializes in culture who further specializes in religion. That same\ngeographer might also conduct side research on environmental issues. And she might, in her\nspare time, investigate geographies of fictional landscapes. One benefit of geography is that its INTRODUCTION 21\nbreadth offers a wide array of phenomena to explore. Everything happens somewhere, and thus\neverything is geographical.\nWithin physical geography, the main sub-disciplines are: biogeography (the study of the spatial\ndistribution of plants and animals), climatology (the study of climate), hydrology (the study of\nwater), and geomorphology (the study of Earth\u2019s topographic features). This list is not inclusive,\nhowever. Some geographers study geodesy, the scientific measurement and representation of\nEarth. Others study pedology, the exploration of soils. What unites physical geographers is an\nemphasis on the scientific study of the physical features of Earth in all of its many forms.\nHuman geography, too, consists of a number of sub-disciplines that often overlap and interact.\nThemainsub-disciplinesofhumangeographyinclude:culturalgeography(thestudyofthespatial\ndimension ofculture), economicgeography (thestudyofthedistribution andspatial organization\nof economic systems), medical geography (the study of the spatial distribution of health and\nmedicine), political geography (the study of the spatial dimension of political processes),\npopulation geography (also known as demography, the study of the characteristics of human\npopulations), and urban geography (the study of urban systems and landscapes). Human\ngeographers essentially explore how humans interact with and affect the earth.\nPolitical geography provides the foundation for investigating what many people understand\nas geography: countries and governmental structures. Political geographers ask questions like\n\u201cWhy does a particular state have a conflict with its neighbor?\u201d and \u201cHow does the government\nof a country affect its voting patterns?\u201d When political geographers study the world, they refer\nto states, which are independent, or sovereign, political entities recognized by the international\ncommunity. Statesarecommonly called \u201ccountries\u201d in theUnited States;Germany, France, China,\nand South Africa are all \u201cstates.\u201d So how many states are there in the world? The question is\nnot as easy to answer as it might seem. What if a state declares itself independent, but is not\nrecognized by the entirety of the international community? What if a state collaborates so closely\nwithitsneighbor thatitgivesupsomeofitssovereignty? Whathappensifastateistakenoverby\nanother state? As of 2019, there are 206 states that could be considered sovereign, though some\nare disputed and are only recognized by one other country. Only 193 states are members of the\nUnited Nations. Others, like Palestine, are characterized as \u201cobserver states.\u201d The United States\nDepartment of State recognizes 195 states as independent, including the Holy See, often known\nas Vatican City, and Kosovo, a disputed state in Southeastern Europe.\nIn addition to questions of sovereignty, political geographers investigate the various forms of\ngovernment found around the world (see Figure 1.19). States govern themselves in a variety\nof ways, but the two main types of government are unitary and federal. In a unitary state,\nthe central government has the most power. Local or regional governments might have some\ndecision-making power, but only at the command of the central government. Most of the states\nof the world have unitary systems. A federal state, on the other hand, has numerous regional\ngovernments or self-governing states in addition to a national government. Several large states\nlike the United States, Russia, and Brazil are federations. 22 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 1.19: Map of Federal and Unitary States (Derivative work from original by Lokal_Profil, Wikimedia\nCommons)\nEconomic geographers explore the spatial distribution of economic activities. Why are certain\nstateswealthierthanothers?Whyarethereregionaldifferencesrelatedtoeconomicdevelopment\nwithin a country? All countries have some sort of economic system but have different resources,\nstyles of development, and government regulations. So how can we compare countries in terms\nof economic development? One way is by examining a country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP),\nthevalueofallthegoodsandservicesproducedinacountryinagivenyear.Often,itishelpfulto\ndivide GDP by the number of people in a country; this is known as GDP per capita and it roughly\nequatestoaverageincome.However,goodshavedifferentcostsindifferentcountries,soGDPper\ncapita is generally given in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), meaning that each country\u2019s\ncurrency is adjusted so that it has roughly the same purchasing power. Thus, GDP per capita in\ntermsofPPPsimply referstotheamount ofgoodsandservices produced inacountry divided by\nthenumberofpeopleinthatcountryandthenadjustedforhowmuchgoodsandservicesactually\ncost in that country.\nOne limitation of GDP is that it only takes into account the goods and services produced\ndomestically. However, many businesses today have locations and production facilities in other\ncountries. Gross national income (GNI) is a way to measure a country\u2019s economic activity that\nincludes all the goods and services produced in a country (GDP) as well as income received from\noverseas.\n1.8 GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY\nWhenwestarttoexplorethespatialdistributionofeconomicdevelopment,wefindthatthereare\nstark differences between and within world regions. Some countries have a very high standard INTRODUCTION 23\nof living and high average incomes, while others have few resources and high levels of poverty.\nPolitically, some countries have stable, open governments, while others have long-standing\nauthoritarian regimes. Thus, world regional geography is, in many ways, a study of global\ninequality. But the geographic study of inequality is more than just asking where inequalities are\npresent, it is also digging deeper and asking why those inequalities exist.\nHow can we measure inequality? Generally, inequality refers to uneven distributions of wealth,\nwhich can actually be challenging to measure. By some accounts, the wealthiest one percent of\npeople in the world have as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. Wealth inequality is just one\nfacetofglobalstudiesofinequality,however.Therearealsodifferencesinincome:aroundhalfof\nthe world survives on less than $2 per day, and around one-fifth have less than $1 per day (see\nFigure 1.20).

For many, the relative size of the world is shrinking as a\nresult of advances in transportation and communications technology.\nFor others, though, particularly those in the poorest, most debt-ridden countries, the world is\nnotflat.Asglobalpovertyrateshavedecreasedoverthepastfewdecades,thenumberofpeople\nliving in poverty within Sub-Saharan Africa has increased. In addition, while global economic\nintegration has increased, most monetary transactions still occur within rather than between\ncountries. The core countries can take advantage of globalization, choosing from a variety of\ntrading partners and suppliers of raw materials, but the same cannot always be said of those\nin the periphery. Globalization has often led to cultural homogenization, as \u201cWestern\u201d culture\nhas increasingly become the global culture. American fast food chains can now be found in a\nmajority of the world\u2019s countries. British and American pop music plays on radio stations around\ntheworld.TheInternetinparticularhasfacilitatedtherapiddiffusionofculturalideasandvalues.\nBut how does globalization affect local cultures? Some worry that as global culture has become\nmore homogenized, local differences are slowly erasing. Traditional music, clothing, and food\npreferencesmightbereplacedbyforeignculturalfeatures,whichcanleadtoconflict.Thereisthus\na tension between globalization, and the benefits of global connectivity, and local culture.\nIt is the uniqueness of the world\u2019s regions, the particular combination of physical landscapes\nand human activities, that has captivated geographers from the earliest explorers to today\u2019s\nresearchers.Andwhileitmightsimplybeinterestingtoreadaboutdistantculturesandappreciate\ntheir uniqueness, geographers continue to dig deeper and ask why these differences exist.\nGeography matters. Even as we have become more culturally homogeneous and economically\ninterconnected, there remain global differences in the geography of countries and these\ndifferences can have profound effects. Geographic study helps us understand the relationship\nbetween the world\u2019s communities, explain global differences and inequalities, and better address\nfuture challenges. CHAPTER 2\nEurope\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Identify the key geographic features of Europe\n\u2022 Explain how the industrial revolution has shaped the geographic landscape of Europe\n\u2022 Summarize how migration has impacted Europe\u2019s population\n\u2022 Describe the current controversies regarding migration to Europe\n2.1 EUROPEAN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND BOUNDARIES\nEurope? Where\u2019s that? It might seem like a relatively easy question to answer, but looking at\nthe map, the boundaries of Europe are harder to define than it might seem. Traditionally, the\ncontinent of \u201cEurope\u201d referred to the western extremity of the landmass known as Eurasia (see\nFigure 2.1). Eurasia is a massive tectonic plate, so determining where exactly Europe ends and\nAsia begins is difficult. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean in the North, the Atlantic Ocean\nand its seas to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea to the south. Europe\u2019s\neastern boundary is typically given as the Ural Mountains, which run north to south from the\nArctic Ocean down through Russia to Kazakhstan. The western portion of Russia, containing the\ncities of St. Petersburg and Moscow, is thus considered part of Europe while the eastern portion\nis considered part of Asia. Culturally and physiographically, Western Russia is strikingly similar\nto Eastern Europe. These two regions share a common history as well with Russian influence\nextending throughout this transition zone.\n25 26 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 2.1: European Physical Geography and Political Boundaries (\u00a9 San Jose, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n3.0)\nIn addition to the Ural Mountains, Europe has several other mountain ranges, most of which\nare in the southern portion of the continent. The Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Carpathians divide\nEurope\u2019s southern Alpine region from the hilly central uplands. Northern Europe is characterized\nbylowlands andisrelatively flat.Europe\u2019swesternhighlands include theScandinavian Mountains\nof Norway and Sweden as well as the Scottish Highlands.\nEurope has a large number of navigable waterways, and most places in Europe are relatively\nshortdistances fromthesea.This hascontributed tonumerous historical trading links acrossthe\nregion and allowed for Europe to dominate maritime travel. The Danube, sometimes referred to\nas the \u201cBlue Danube\u201d after a famous Austrian waltz of the same name, is the European region\u2019s\nlargest river and winds its way along 2,860 km (1,780 mi) and 10 countries from Germany to\nUkraine.\nThis proximity to water also affects Europe\u2019s climate (see Figure 2.2). While you might imagine\nmuch of Europe to be quite cold given its high latitudinal position, the region is surprisingly\ntemperate. The Gulf Stream brings warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean to Europe\u2019s coastal region EUROPE 27\nand warms the winds that blow across the continent. Amsterdam, for example, lies just above\nthe 52\u00b0N line of latitude, around the same latitudinal position as Saskatoon, in Canada\u2019s central\nSaskatchewan province. Yet Amsterdam\u2019s average low in January, its coldest month, is around\n0.8\u00b0C (33.4\u00b0F) while Saskatoon\u2019s average low in January is -20.7\u00b0C (-5.3\u00b0F)!\nFigure 2.2: Europe Climate Classification (\u00a9 Ali Zifan, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nWhile geographers can discuss Europe\u2019s absolute location and the specific features of its\nphysical environment, we can also consider Europe\u2019s relative location. That is, its location relative\ntootherpartsoftheworld.Europeliesattheheartofwhat\u2019sknownasthelandhemisphere.Ifyou\ntipped a globe on its side and split it so that half of the world had most of the land and half had\nmost of the water, Europe would be at the center of this land hemisphere (see Figure 2.3). This, 28 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\ncombined with the presence of numerous navigable waterways, allowed for maximum contact\nbetween Europe and the rest of the world. Furthermore, distances between countries in Europe\nare relatively small. Paris, France, for example, is just over a two-hour high speed rail trip from\nLondon, England.\nFigure 2.3: Map of Land and Water Hemispheres and Europe\u2019s Relative Location (Derivative work from original by\nCitynoise, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nThis relative location provided efficient travel times between Europe and the rest of the world,\nwhich contributed to Europe\u2019s historical dominance. When we consider globalization, the scale\nof the world is shrinking as the world\u2019s people are becoming more interconnected. For Europe,\nhowever, the region\u2019s peoples have long been interconnected with overlapping histories, physical\nfeatures, and resources.\n2.2 COOPERATION AND CONTROL IN EUROPE\nEurope\u2019s physical landforms, climate, and underlying resources have shaped the distribution of\npeople across the region.When early humans began settling this region, they likely migrated\nthrough the Caucasus Mountains of Southwest Asia and across the Bosporus Strait from what is\nnow Turkey into Greece. The Greeks provided much of the cultural and political foundations for\nmodern European society. Greek ideals of democracy, humanism, and rationalism reemerged in\nEurope during the Age of Enlightenment. The Roman Empire followed the Greek Empire, pushing\nfurther into Europe and leaving its own marks on European society (see Figure 2.4). Modern\nEuropeanarchitecture,governance,andevenlanguagecanbetracedbacktotheRomanEmpire\u2019s\ninfluence. EUROPE 29\nFigure 2.4: Map of the Roman Empire, 117 AD\/CE (Map by Andrei nacu, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nThe Roman\u2019s vast European and Southwest Asian empire united the region under Christianity\nandcreatednewnetworksofroadsandtradingports.WiththefalloftheRomanEmpire,however,\ntribal and ethnic allegiances reemerged and a number of invasions and migrations occurred.\nEngland,forexample,wassettledbytheGermanicAnglo-Saxons,fromwhichthename\u201cEngland\u201d\nor \u201cAngeln\u201d is derived, then by the Normans from present-day France.\nEurope today is comprised of 40 countries, but historically, this was a region dominated by\nkingdoms and empires \u2013 even fairly recently. A map of Europe from just 200 years ago looks\nstrikingly different from today\u2019s political boundaries (see Figure 2.5) . At that time, Greece and\nTurkey were still controlled by the Ottoman Empire and Italy was a conglomerate of various city-\nstates and independent kingdoms. Many of the countries and political boundaries of Europe we\nknow today were not formed until after World War II. 30 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 2.5: Map of Europe, 1812 CE (\u00a9 Alexander Altenhof, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nEurope\u2019s population has shifted and changed over time as well. Whereas Europe was once\nlargely feudal and agrarian, today around 75 percent of its people live in cities. Europe\u2019s largest\ncity is London, with a population of around 8.5 million within its city limits. Although the United\nKingdomwasthedominantforceinEuropeduringindustrialization,Germanynowdominatesthe\nregion in terms of population, gross domestic product, and size.\nThe political map of Europe continues to change, with shifting alliances, competing goals,\nand new pushes for independence. In general, Western Europe has moved toward cooperation.\nThe European Union developed out of the Benelux Economic Union signed in 1944 between\nBelgium,theNetherlands,andLuxembourg.France,Italy,andWestGermanysignedaneconomic\nagreement with the Benelux states in 1957, and from there, the economic cooperation continued\ntoexpand.TheEuropeanUnion(EU)itselfwascreatedin1993andtoday,theorganizationhas28\nmember countries (see Figure 2.6). Not all members of the EU use the euro, its official currency;\nthe 19 member states who do are known as the eurozone. EUROPE 31\nFigure 2.6: The European Union and the Eurozone (Derivative work from original by JLogan, Wikimedia Commons)\nToday, it is relatively easy to travel across Europe, in part because of economic and monetary\ncooperation, but also because internal border checks have largely been abolished. The Schengen\nAgreement, signed in the 1990s allows member states to essentially function as a single territory\nintermsofentry.Thesestatesshareacommonvisasystemandresidentsandvehiclescantravel\nfreely throughout states participating in the agreement.\nAlthough the European Union has provided member states with a number of advantages, the\nsystem has had some structural concerns. Greece, for example, admitted to the EU in 1981,\nadopted the euro in 2001. It has had continued issues with debt, however, and has required\nmassive bailouts from other member states. The United Kingdom held a referendum in June\n2016 and decided to leave the EU, the first time a country has made the decision to leave the\norganization. When analyzing the EU and its advantages and disadvantages, you might consider\nwhy a country would join a supranational organization. To join an organization like the EU, a\ncountry gives up some of its sovereignty, its independence in making economic, political, or legal\ndecisions. Ideally, a country would gain more than it loses. Countries united economically can\nmore easily facilitate trade, for example, or could share a common military rather than each\nsupportingtheirown.ThosewhofavoredtheUnitedKingdomwithdrawingfromtheEU,however,\nargued that membership in the EU did not offer enough advantages and preferred the United\nKingdom to control its own trade deals and immigration restrictions.\nDevolution, which occurs when regions within a state seek greater autonomy, has continued\nin Europe, representing a tension between nationalistic ideals and ethnic ties. In the United 32 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nKingdom, a 2014 Scottish independence referendum was narrowly defeated but led to greater\nautonomy for Scotland. In general, policies offering increased autonomy have kept the map of\nWesternEuropefairlyintact.Ethnicgroupsseekingsovereigntyoftenwantpoliticalautonomybut\neconomic integration, and thus devolution generally allows them more decision-making power.\nIn the Balkan region, however, strong ethnic identities has contributed to continued political\ninstabilityandtheformationofnewstates.Infact,thedevolutionaryforcesfoundinthisregionled\nto the creation of the term Balkanization, referring to the tendency of territories to break up into\nsmaller,oftenhostileunits.TheBalkanscameunderthecontroloftheOttomanEmpire,andonce\nthe empire collapsed following World War I, several territories in this region were joined together\nas the country of Yugoslavia (see Figure 2.7). Following World War II, Yugoslavia was led by Josip\nBrozTitowhoattemptedtounifytheregionbysuppressingethnicallegiancesinfavorofnational\nunity. After his death, however, those ethnic tensions reemerged. In the 1990s, Yugoslavia was\nled by the dictator Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u00b4c, a Serbian who supported a genocidal campaign against\nthe region\u2019s Croats, Bosnians, and Albanians.

Most recently, Kosovo, comprised mostly of Albanian Muslims, declared\nindependencefromSerbiain2008,thoughitsstatusasasovereignstateisstillcontestedbysome,\nincluding Serbia, Bosnia, and Greece.\nFigure 2.7: Map of Former Yugoslavia (United Nations, Public Domain) EUROPE 33\nThe map of Europe continues to evolve.

The Industrial Revolution refers to the changes in manufacturing that 34 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\noccurredinthelate18thandearly19thcenturies.Thesechangeshadprofoundeffectsonsociety,\neconomics, and agriculture, not just in Europe, but globally.\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution, most goods in Europe were produced in the home. These so-\ncalled \u201ccottage\u201d industries consisted of individual workers making unique goods in their homes,\nusuallyonapart-timebasis.Theseproducts,suchasclothing,candles,orsmallhousewares,could\nbe sold by a farming family to supplement their income.\nThe Industrial Revolution began in the United Kingdom, and while it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the\nexact point at which the revolution began, a key invention was James Watt\u2019s steam engine, which\nentered production in 1775. This steam-driven engine was adopted by industries to allow for\nfactory production. Machines could now be used instead of human or animal labor. Interestingly,\na side effect of the steam engine was that it enabled better iron production, since iron required\nan even and steady stream of heat. This improved iron was then used to build more efficient\nsteam engines, which in turn produced increasingly better iron. These improvements and new\ntechnologies gradually spread across Europe, eventually diffusing to the United States and Japan.\nDuring this time, there were also significant changes in agricultural production. The Agrarian\nRevolution began in the mid-1750s and was based upon a number of agricultural innovations.\nThis was the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific reasoning championed during this era\nwas applied to the growing of crops. Farmers began using mechanized equipment, rather than\nrelying solely on human or animal labor. Fertilizers improved soil conditions, and crop rotation\nand complementary planting further increased crop yields. During this time period, there was a\nshift to commercial agriculture, where excess crops are sold for a profit, rather than subsistence\nagriculture, where farmers primarily grow food for their own family\u2019s consumption.\nAround the same time improvements in rail transportation changed both the way goods were\ndistributed across Europe and the movement of people across the region. The use of steam\nengines and improved iron also transformed the shipping industry, with steamships beginning to\nset sail across the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Agrarian Revolution coupled with the Industrial Revolution profoundly changed European\ngeography. With the improvements of the Agrarian Revolution, farmers could produce more with\nless work. This provided an agricultural surplus, enabling a sustained population increase. Port\ncities and capital cities became centers of trade and expanded. Critically, the Agrarian Revolution\nfreed workers from having to farm, since fewer farmers were needed to produce the same\namount of crops, enabling people to find work in the factories. These factories were primarily\nlocated in cities, and thus it was the combination of these two revolutions that dramatically\nincreasedurbanizationinEurope.Atthestartofthe19thcentury,around17percentofEngland\u2019s\npopulation lived in cities; by the end of the 19th century, that figure had risen to 54 percent.\nOverall, the Industrial Revolution considerably improved European power by boosting their\neconomies, improving their military technology, and increasing their transportation efficiency.\nEven before the Industrial Revolution, Europe exerted a considerable amount of control over\nthe rest of the world. European colonialism began in the 1400s, led by Portugal and Spain. In\nthe 1500s, England, France, and the Dutch began their own colonial campaigns. By the start of\nWorldWarI,theBritishEmpire,boostedbytheimprovementsoftheIndustrialRevolution,hadthe\nlargest empire in history, covering 20 percent of the world\u2019s population at the time (see Figure\n2.9). EUROPE 35\nFigure 2.9: European Colonization (Derivative work from original by Cogito ergo sumo, Wikimedia Commons)\nCoinciding with the Industrial and Agrarian Revolutions were a number of political revolutions\ninEurope.ThemostinfluentialpoliticalchangecameastheresultoftheFrenchRevolution,which\noccurred between 1789 and 1799 CE. This revolution ended France\u2019s monarchy, establishing a\nrepublic, and provided the foundation for numerous political revolutions that followed. It also\nweakened the power of the Roman Catholic Church in France, inspiring the modern-day\nseparation between church and state that is typical of many Western countries, including the\nUnited States.\nToday, the map of Europe reflects the changes brought about by the Industrial and Agrarian\nRevolutions as well as the political changes that took place throughout the time period. Europe\u2019s\ncore area, where economic output is highest, is largely centered around the manufacturing areas\nthat arose during the Industrial Revolution (see Figure 2.10). These manufacturing areas in turn\nwere originally located near the raw materials, such as coal, that could sustain industrial growth. 36 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 2.10: Regions of Europe (Map by Koyos, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nThe shift in labor that occurred during the Industrial Revolution, as people left rural farms to\nfindworkinfactories,ledtothespecializationoflaborthatisfoundinEuropetoday.Areaswithin\nEuropetendedtospecializeintheproductionofparticulargoods.NorthernItalyforexample,has\nmaintainedaspecialtyintheproductionoftextiles.Germanycontinuestospecializeinautomotive\nmanufacturing.TheBenzPatent-Motorwagen,theworld\u2019sfirstgasolinepoweredautomobile,was\nfirst built in Germany in 1886 and would later develop into the Mercedes-Benz corporation.

Many areas in Europe have shifted from more traditional to high-tech\nmanufacturing and industrial output in the region remains high.\n2.4 EUROPEAN MIGRATION\nThe Industrial and Agricultural Revolutions shaped both migration patterns within Europe and\nimmigration to the region. Migration refers to a move from one place to another intended to\nbe permanent. When considering migration, geographers look at both intraregional migration,\nmovementwithin aparticular region,andinterregional migration, suchasmigration fromEurope\nto North America. Geographers who study migration also investigate push and pull factors that\ninfluence people to move. Push factors are those that compel you to move from your current\nlocation. A lack of job opportunities, environmental dangers, or political turmoil would all be\nconsidered push factors. Pull factors, on the other hand, are those that entice you to move to\na new place, and might include ample jobs, freedom from political or religious persecution, or\nsimply the availability of desirable amenities. Historically, most intraregional migration in Europe\nwas rural to urban, as people moved from farms to cities to find work. Cities grew rapidly in the\nregion as centers of trade and industry.\nBefore the industrial revolution, migration to the region was usually in the form of invasions,\nsuch as with the Roman Empire, the Islamic Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. One notable,\nhistorical migration that did not represent an invading empire was the Jewish diaspora following\nthe conquest of Judea, the region now known as Israel and Palestine, by a number of groups\nincluding the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Romans. A diaspora refers to a group of people living\noutsideoftheirancestralhomelandandmanyJewishpeoplemovedtoEuropetoescapeviolence\nand persecution, particularly after the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in\n70 CE.\nJews migrating to Europe were often met with anti-Semitism, however. During the Middle\nAges, European Jews were routinely attacked and were expelled from several countries including\nEngland and France. Jewish communities were destroyed during the mid-14th century as the\nBlack Death swept across Europe and thousands of Jews were murdered, accused of poisoning\nthe water and orchestrating the epidemic. In actuality, the disease was likely spread by rats, and\nworsened by the superstitious killing of cats in the same time period.\nEuropean Jews were often forced to live in distinct neighborhoods, also known as ghettos. In\nfact, this requirement to live in specific areas was required in Italy under areas ruled by the Pope\nuntil 1870. These distinctive communities were often met with suspicion by European Christians,\nmany of whom continued to foster the same anti-Semitic sentiment that had been prevalent\nduring the Middle Ages.\nThis anti-Semitic fervor and persecution of Jews reached its height at the time of the Nazi\nParty\u2019s rule in Germany. Prior to World War II, close to 9 million Jews lived in Europe; 6 million\nof them were killed in the Holocaust, the European genocide that targeted Jews, Poles, Soviets,\ncommunists, homosexuals, the disabled, and numerous other groups viewed as undesirable by\ntheNaziregime.Followingthewar,manysurvivingJewsemigratedbacktothenewlycreatedstate\nof Israel. Around 2.4 million Jews live in Europe today. 38 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nTherewasanothershiftinpopulationafterthesigningoftheSchengenAgreementin1995,with\nlargenumbersofimmigrantsfromEasternEuropemigratedtothewesternEuropeancountriesin\nthecore.CitizensofEuropeanUnioncountriesarepermittedtoliveandworkinanycountryinthe\nEU, and countries like the United Kingdom and Spain contain large numbers of Eastern European\nimmigrants. Around half of all European migrants are from other countries within Europe.\nEconomic and political inequalities have driven much of the interregional migration to Europe\nsincethe1980s.ImmigrantsfromNorthAfricaandSouthwestAsia,forexample,drivenbylimited\nemployment opportunities and political conflict, have migrated to Europe in large numbers and\nnow represent approximately 12 percent of all European migrants.\n2.5 SHIFTING NATIONAL IDENTITIES\nWhat does it mean to be European? Perhaps simply it means someone who\u2019s from Europe. But\nwhat does it mean to be French or German or Spanish or British? These countries have long\nbeencomprised ofanumber ofdifferent ethnic andlinguistic groups (seeFigure 2.11).Spain, for\nexample,notonlycontainsgroupsspeakingSpanish,thelanguageofthehistoricCastilianpeople\nof the region, but also the Basque-speaking region in the north, the Catalan-speaking region\ncentered around Barcelona, and numerous other distinct language groups. The United Kingdom,\nwhile comprised primarily of people who identify as \u201cEnglish,\u201d also includes the areas of Wales,\nScotland, and Northern Ireland, each with a distinct linguistic and cultural identity. The Welsh are\nactually believed to be the oldest ethnic group within the United Kingdom, so perhaps they could\nargue that they represent the original national identity. EUROPE 39\nFigure 2.11: Languages of Europe (Map by Andrei nacu, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nBefore the creation of states as we understand them today, Europe, as with the rest of the\nworld,wasdividedlargelybyethnicityortribe.Empiresoftentookcontrolofmultipleethnicareas.\nFamilialallegianceswereoffundamentalimportance.That\u2019snottosaythatgeographyorterritory\ndidn\u2019t matter, but simply thatwhoyou were mattered more thanwhereyou were.\nThe creation of sovereign political states changed this notion. Multiple ethnicities were often\nlumped together under single political entities, sometimes due to peaceful alliances and\nsometimes due to armed conquest. In cases where a state was dominated by a single,\nhomogeneous ethnic and linguistic cultural identity, we would refer to it as a nation-state,\nfrom the term state, meaning a sovereign political area, and nation, meaning a group with a\ndistinct ethnic and cultural identity. Several European countries today are considered nation-\nstates, including Poland, where 93 percent of the population is ethnically Polish, and Iceland,\nwhichis92percentIcelandic.Historically,countrieslikeFranceandGermanywerealsoconsidered\nnation-states, though immigration has changed their cultural landscape. 40 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nThe concept of nation-state is distinct from the idea of nationalism, which refers the feeling of\npolitical unity within a territory. National flags, anthems, symbols, and pledges all inspire a sense\nof belonging amongst people within a geographic area that is distinct from their ethnic identity.\nWhat happens when feelings of nationalism and national identity are linked with a particular\nethnic group? In cases where a particular ethnic group represents the majority, nationalist ideals\nmight be representative of that group\u2019s language or religion. But what if there are other, minority\nethnic groups that are excluded from what people think it means to be part of a particular state\u2019s\nnationalist identity?\nMigration has continually changed the cultural landscape of Europe and as immigrant groups\nhave challenged or been challenged by ideas of nationalism. In 1290 CE, King Edward I expelled\nall Jews from England, essentially establishing Christianity as being at the core of English national\nidentity. This expulsion lasted until 1657 CE. In France after the French Revolution, ideas of\nnationalism included \u201cliberty, equality, and fraternity,\u201d and extended into areas they conquered.\nIn Germany, what it meant to be \u201cGerman\u201d under the Nazi Party excluded those who were\nconsidered to be \u201cundesirable\u201d and \u201cenemies of the state,\u201d such as Jews, Roma (sometimes\nreferredtoasGypsies),personslabeledas\u201chomosexuals,\u201dcommunists,andothers.UnderBenito\nMussolini, Italian nationalism excluded Slavs, Jews, and non-white groups.\nNationalism, taken to this extreme, is known as fascism. Fascists believe that national unity,\nto include a strong, authoritarian leader and a one-party state, provides a state with the most\neffective military and economy. Fascist governments might thus blame economic difficulty or\nmilitary losses on groups that threaten national unity, even if those groups include their own\ncitizens.\nWithin every country, ideas of nationalism grow, weaken, and change over time. Centrifugal\nforces are those that threaten national unity by dividing a state. These might include differing\nreligiousbeliefs,linguisticdifferences,orevenphysicalbarrierswithinastate.Centripetalforces,\nontheotherhand,tendtounifypeoplewithinacountry.Acharismaticleader,acommonreligion\nor language, and a strong national infrastructure can all work as centripetal forces. Governments\ncould also promote centripetal forces by unifying citizens against a common enemy, such as\nduring the Cold War. Although the countries of Europe always had a significant amount of ethnic\nand linguistic variety, they typically maintained a strong sense of national identity. Religion in\nparticular often worked as a centripetal force, uniting varying cultural groups under a common\ntheological banner.\nReligious adherence in Europe is shifting, however. In Sweden, for example, over 80 percent of\nthe population belonged to the Church of Sweden, a Lutheran denomination, in 2000. By 2014,\nonly64.6percentclaimedmembershipinthechurchandjust18percentofthepopulationstated\nthat they believed in a personal God (see Figure 2.12). This is indicative of a broad shift in Europe\nfrom traditional, organized religion toward humanism or secularism. Humanism is a philosophy\nemphasizing the value of human beings and the use of reason in solving problems. Modern\nhumanism was founded during the French Revolution, though early forms of humanism were\nintegrated with religious beliefs. Secular humanism, a form of humanism that rejects religious\nbeliefs, developed later. Secularism refers broadly to the exclusion of religious ideologies from\ngovernment or public activities. EUROPE 41\nFigure 2.12: Percentage of People Who Answered \u201cI believe there is a God\u201d in 2005\nEurobarometer Poll (\u00a9 Alphathon, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nGeographers can examine how secularization has occurred in Europe; that is, how Europe has\nbeen transformed from countries with strong religious values to a more nonreligious society. In\ngeneral, areas within the core of Europe tend to be more secular and thus some researchers\nlinksecularizationwithrisingeconomicprosperity.MostWesternEuropeancountrieshavestrong\nsocial welfare programs, where citizens pay a higher percentage of taxes to support universal\nhealthcare, higher education, child care, and retirement programs. These social welfare\nprograms often serve as centripetal forces, unifying a country by providing government support\nand preventing citizens from falling into extreme poverty.\n2.6 CURRENT MIGRATION PATTERNS AND DEBATES\nThe increasing secularization of Western Europe has magnified the conflict over immigration to\nthe region. Whereas Western Europeans have become less religious over time, immigrants to the\nregion are generally more religious. Increasing numbers of Muslim immigrants from North Africa\nandSouthwestAsiahavesettledinEurope,luredbythehopeofeconomicprosperityandpolitical 42 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nfreedom. In 2010, around 6 percent of Europe identified as Muslim. That number is expected to\ngrow to 10 percent by 2050. Muslims have the highest fertility rate among the major religious\ngroups,socoupledwithincreasingimmigration,thispopulationisgrowing.Incontrast,justunder\nthree-quartersofEuropeansidentifiedasChristianin2010.Thisisexpectedtodropto65percent\nin 2050.\nEuropeans are divided about how open the region should be to immigrants, and how asylum\nseekers, refugees seeking sanctuary from oppression, should be treated. Even before the 2015\nwaveofSyrianmigrantstoEurope,a2012-2014surveyshowedthatmostEuropeans(52percent)\nwanted immigration levels to decrease. Opinions vary within the region, however. In the United\nKingdom, 69 percent of people support decreased immigration. In Greece, a gateway country\nfor migrants attempting to enter Europe, 84 percent of people desire decreased immigration. A\nmajority of adults in Northern European countries, however, want immigration to stay the same\nor increase.\nIn 2014 and 2015, migration to Europe intensified as a result of an ongoing civil war in Syria.\nThere were more refugees in 2014 than in any other year since World War II. 2015 shattered\nthat record, however, as 65.3 million people were displaced. Germany has received the most\napplications for people seeking refugee status.\nThe journey for migrants is difficult and dangerous. Many attempt to cross by sea into Greece.\nBoats are often overcrowded and capsizing is common. Around 34 percent of refugees are\nchildren,manyofthemunaccompanied.Althoughtheentireinfluxofrefugeesrepresentsaround\n0.5percentofEurope\u2019spopulation,itisnotnecessarilythesheernumberofrefugeesthatposesa\nproblem,butrather,theideaofhowimmigrantpopulationsmightchangetheidentityofanation-\nstate.\nMany small towns in Europe have experienced shifting demographics as people move away\nto work in cities and immigrants move in to work in the available jobs. As Western Europe\nmoved through industrialization, it has increasingly shifted away from heavy manufacturing and\nincreasedemploymentinserviceandhigh-techindustries,aprocessknownasdeindustrialization.\nThe higher-skilled and higher-educated workers from small towns moved to the cities to find\nwork, while lower-skilled immigrants worked the often dangerous or labor intensive jobs that\nremained. In the United Kingdom in particular, many of the people who oppose immigration and\nsupported Britain leaving the EU are located in these small towns where immigration has quite\nvisibly changed the cultural landscape that had already shifted as a result of deindustrialization.\nFor some, the debate over immigration and asylum are less questions of national identity and\nmore issues of social justice. Do countries that have political freedom and economic prosperity\nhave a moral obligation to assist those in need? Historically, the answer has often been \u201cno.\u201d In\n1938,onthebrinkofWorldWarII,representativesfromWesternEuropeancountriesvotednotto\naccept Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria.

CHAPTER 3\nRussia\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Identify the key geographic features of Russia\n\u2022 Analyze how the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union approached the issue of ethnic\nidentity\n\u2022 Describe the current areas of ethnic conflict within Russia\n\u2022 Explain how Russian history impacted its modern-day geographic landscape\n3.1 RUSSIA\u2019S PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE\nRussia is the largest country in the world, containing 1\/8 of the entire world\u2019s land area (see\nFigure 3.1). Russia is also the northernmost large and populous country in the world, with much\nof the country lying above the Arctic Circle. Its population, however, is comparatively small with\naround 143 million people, the majority of whom live south of the 60 degree latitude line and\nin the western portions of Russia near Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Russia stretches across\neleven time zones, spanning 6,000 miles from Saint Petersburg on the Baltic Sea to Vladivostok\non the Pacific Coast. The country also includes the exclave, or discontinuous piece of territory, of\nKaliningrad situated between Poland and Lithuania.\n44 RUSSIA 45\nFigure 3.1: Map of Russia (CIA World Factbook, Public Domain)\nBecause of its large size, Russia has a wide variety of natural features and resources. The\ncountry is located on the northeastern portion of the Eurasian landmass. It is bordered to the\nnorth by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Pacific Ocean, and to the south, by the Black\nand Caspian Seas. The Ural Mountains, running north to south, traditionally form the boundary\nbetweenEuropeandAsiaandpresentedaformidablehistoricalbarriertodevelopment.Culturally\nand physiographically, Western Russia, beyond the Ural Mountains, is quite similar to that of\nEastern Europe. The region of Russia east of the Ural Mountains is known as Siberia.\nIn addition to the Ural Mountains, Russia contains several other areas of high relief (see Figure\n3.2). Most notably, the Caucasus Mountains, forming the border between Russia and Southwest\nAsia, and the volcanic highlands of Russia\u2019s far east Kamchatka Peninsula. The western half of\nRussia is generally more mountainous than the eastern half, which is mostly low-elevation plains. 46 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 3.2: Topographical Map of Russia (\u00a9 Tobias1984, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nRussia\u2019s Volga River, running through central Russia into the Caspian Sea, is the longest river\non the European continent and drains most of western Russia. The river is also an important\nsourceofirrigationandhydroelectricpower.LakeBaikal,locatedinsouthernSiberia,istheworld\u2019s\ndeepestlakeandalsotheworld\u2019slargestfreshwaterlake.Itcontainsaroundone-fifthoftheentire\nworld\u2019s unfrozen surface water. Like the deep lakes of Africa\u2019s rift valley, Lake Baikal was formed\nfrom a divergent tectonic plate boundary.\nAlthough Russia\u2019s land area is quite large, much of the region is too cold for agriculture. As\nshown in Figure 3.3, the northernmost portion of Russia is dominated by tundra, a biome\ncharacterized by very cold temperatures and limited tree growth. Here, temperatures can drop\nbelow-50\u00b0C(-58\u00b0F)andmuchofthesoilispermafrost,soilthatisconsistentlybelowthefreezing\npoint of water (0\u00b0C or 32\u00b0F). South of the tundra is the taiga region, where coniferous, snow-\ncappedforestsdominate.ThisareaofRussiacontainstheworld\u2019slargestwoodresources,though\nlogging in the region has diminished the supply. South of the taiga region are areas of temperate\nbroadleaf forests andsteppe, an area of treeless, grassland plains. RUSSIA 47\nFigure 3.3: Biomes of Russia (Derivative work from original by Sten Porse, Wikimedia Commons)\nAlthough looking at a map, you might assume that Russia has extensive port facilities owing\nto its vast eastern coastline, it actually has relatively few ice-free ports. Vladivostok, located in\nthe extreme southeastern tip of Russia, is its largest port on the Pacific Ocean (see Figure 3.4).\nMuch of the rest of Russia\u2019s Far East region is ice-covered throughout the year, making maritime\nand automotive transport difficult. In fact, this region was only connected to the rest of Russia by\nhighway for the first time in 2010. 48 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 3.4: Port of Vladivostok, Russia (\u00a9 Dr. Leonid Kozlov, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nRussia\u2019s climate more broadly is affected by a number of key factors. In terms of its latitudinal\nposition, meaning its position relative to the equator, Russia is located very far north. In general,\nas you increase in latitude away from the equator, the climate gets colder. The strong east-\nwest alignment of Russia\u2019s major biomes reflects this latitudinal influence. Russia\u2019s climate is\nalso affected by its continental position. In general, areas that exhibit a continental climate are\nlocated near the center of a continent away from water bodies and experience more extremes in\ntemperature due to drier air. Water helps regulate air temperature and can absorb temperature\nchanges better than land. In the winter, areas away from water can be very cold, while in the\nsummer,temperaturesarequitehotandthereislittleprecipitation.Thethirdkeydriverofclimate\ninRussiaisitsaltitudinalposition.Asyouincreaseinelevation,temperaturesdecrease.Youmight\nhave experienced this when hiking in mountains or flying on an aircraft and feeling the cold\nwindow. Russia\u2019s Ural Mountains, for example, are clearly visible on a map of its biomes as the\nalpine tundra region owing to its high altitude.\n3.2 SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES\nRussia\u2019ssizeandvariedphysiographicregionshavepresentedsomechallengesforitspopulation.\nMuch of Russia is simply too cold for widespread human settlement. Thus, even though Russia is RUSSIA 49\nthe largest country, the area that is suitable for agriculture and intensive development is much\nsmaller. In Russia\u2019s northern regions, agricultural development is restricted by short growing\nseasonsandfrequentdroughts.Assnowmelts,ittakestopsoilwithit,andthuserosionisaserious\nissue in these areas as well.\nStill, some have carved out settlements in this frigid environment. Oymyakon, located in\nnortheastern Russia, is considered to be the coldest permanently inhabited places in the world\n(see Figure 3.5). It has a population of around 500 and temperatures here once dropped to\n-71.2\u00b0C (-96\u00b0F)! It takes 20 hours to reach Oymyakon from the nearest city of Yakutsk.\nFigure 3.5: Map of Oymyakon, Russia (Derivative work from original by Marmelad, Wikimedia Commons)\nIndustry, too, is hampered by Russia\u2019s cold climate in the Siberian region. Although Siberia\naccounts for over three-quarters of Russia\u2019s land area, it contains only one-quarter of its\npopulation. In a region so sparsely populated, how do you build roads, factories, and large\nsettlements? Even if there are resources present, as there are, how do you get them to nearby\nindustrial areas? The industrial developments and human settlements that do exist in this region\nrequire high energy consumption and highly specialized facilities needed to cope with cold\ntemperatures and permanently frozen soil.\nHowever, global changes in climate have had some dramatic effects on Russian geography.\nAreas that were previously permafrost have begun to thaw, leading to erosion and mud, which\nboth present challenges for development. In Siberia, giant holes in the ground began to appear\naround 2014 and initially baffled scientists. These massive holes were later found to be pockets\nof methane gas trapped in previously frozen soil that had thawed due to the warming climate. If\nglobaltemperaturescontinuetoclimb,theareaofpermafrostwillshrink,increasingthepotential\nfor agriculture in northern Russia. New oil and gas reserves that were previously trapped under 50 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nfrozen soil could likewise become available. Previous shipping routes along Russia\u2019s eastern and\nnorthern coasts that were covered in ice could become passable.\nWhile warming temperatures might seem beneficial for Russia\u2019s frigid northern region, they\nare accompanied by more troublesome long-term concerns. It is estimated that a huge amount\nof carbon, around 1600 gigatons (or 1.6 trillion tons), is stored in the world\u2019s permafrost. The\nmethane and carbon released from these permafrost stores could exacerbate global warming.\nChanging temperatures have also been associated with the increased risk of wildfires. In Russia,\npeatlands, areas of partially decayed vegetation, are particularly at risk. There has been an\nincrease in droughts and flooding throughout Russia and many scientists believe that Russia\u2019s\nclose proximity to the Arctic Circle makes it even more vulnerable to changes in temperature.\nClimate factors have also shaped the distribution of Russia\u2019s population. Most of Russia\u2019s\npopulation lives west of the Ural Mountains where the climate is more temperate and there are\nmore connections with Eastern Europe (see Figure 3.6). Russia is highly urbanized, with almost\nthree-quarters of the population living in cities. Its largest city and capital, Moscow, is home to\naround 12 million people.\nFigure 3.6: Population Density in Russia, 2012 (Derivative work from original by Kartoshka1994, Wikimedia\nCommons)\nRussia\u2019s population has experienced some interesting changes over the past few decades. Its\npopulation peaked at over 148 million in the early 1990s before experiencing a rapid decline.\nWhen geographers explore a country\u2019s population, they don\u2019t just ask \u201cWhere is it changing?\u201d but\nalso \u201cWhy is it changing?\u201d For Russia, the economic declines coinciding with the dissolution of\nthe Soviet Union contributed to low birth rates. Generally, when a country experiences economic\ndeclineoruncertainty,peopletendtodelayhavingchildren.Today,duetohigherbirthratesanda RUSSIA 51\ngovernment push to encourage immigration, Russia\u2019s population growth has stabilized and could\ngrow from 143.5 million in 2013 to 146 million by 2050. Russia\u2019s death rate remains quite high,\nhowever, at 13.1 per 1000 people compared to the European Union average of 9.7 per 1000.\nAlcoholismratesarehigh,particularlyamongmeninRussia,andcardiovasculardiseaseaccounts\nfor over half of all deaths. In addition, although Russia is highly urbanized, more people are now\nmoving from Russia\u2019s crowded cities to more sparsely populated rural areas, in contrast to the\nmore common rural to urban migration seen elsewhere in the world.\n3.3 RUSSIAN HISTORY AND EXPANSION\nRussia\u2019s current geographic landscape has been shaped by physical features, such as climate\nand topography, as well as historical events. Why is the capital of Russia Moscow, and why is\nits population so clustered in the west? In the 13th century, Moscow was actually an important\nprincipality, or city-state ruled by a monarch. The Grand Duchy of Moscow, or Muscovy as it was\nknowninEnglish,becameapowerfulstate,defeatingandsurroundingitsneighborsandclaiming\ncontroloveralargeportionofRus\u2019territory,anancientregionoccupiedbyanumberofEastSlavic\ntribes.TheSlavsrepresentthelargestIndo-Europeanethno-linguisticgroupinEuropeandinclude\nPoles, Ukrainians, Serbs, as well as Russians.\nFromthemid-1400sonward,theMuscoviteterritoryexpandedatanimpressiverate(seeFigure\n3.7). In 1300 CE, the territory occupied an area of around 20,000 square kilometers; by 1462 CE,\nthat number increased to 430,000 square kilometers. By 1584 CE, the territory had swelled to 5.4\nmillion square kilometers. 52 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 3.8: Growth of Russia, 1300-1900 (Map by Stephan Steinbach, www.alternativetransport.wordpress.com, CC\nBY-SA)\nDuring this time, Russia\u2019s government shifted as well. In 1547 CE, Grand Duke Ivan IV, better\nknownas\u201cIvantheTerrible,\u201dcrownedhimselfthefirstTsar.Thetermtsar,alsospelledczar,stems\nfrom the Roman title \u201cCaesar\u201d and was used to designate a ruler, much like the term \u201cking\u201d or\n\u201cemperor.\u201d Ivan IV nearly doubled the territory of Russia during his reign, conquering numerous\nsurrounding ethnic groups and tribes.\nRussia\u2019s status as an \u201cempire\u201d dates back to the 1700s under the rule of Peter the Great. Peter\nwas able to conquer Russia\u2019s northwestern regions, establishing eastern seaports and founding\nthe forward capital of Saint Petersburg along the Baltic Sea. A forward capital is a capital that RUSSIA 53\nhasbeenintentionallyrelocated,generallybecauseofeconomicorstrategicreasons,andisoften\npositionedontheedgeofcontestedterritory.Overall,thereformsofPetertheGreattransformed\nthe country and made it more similar to Western Europe.\nThe conclusion of World War I coincided with the end of the Russian Empire. The Russian\nArmy fared poorly in the war, with approximately 1.7 million casualties. Russia\u2019s people felt that\nthe ruling class had become detached from the problems of everyday people and there were\nwidespread rumors of corruption. Russia went through a rapid period of industrialization, which\nleft many traditional farmers out of work. As people moved to the cities, there was inadequate\nhousing and insufficient jobs. The economic and human cost of World War I, coupled with the\nplight of workers who felt exploited during the Industrial Revolution, ultimately led to the\noverthrow of Nicholas II who, along with his family, was imprisoned and later executed.\nEventually,theBolsheviks,aMarxistpoliticalpartyledbyVladimirLenin,overthrewtheinterim\ngovernment and created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, abbreviated as the USSR and\nsometimessimplycalledtheSovietUnion.ThecapitalwasalsomovedbacktoMoscowfromSaint\nPetersburg. After Lenin\u2019s death in 1924, Joseph Stalin took control and instituted both a socialist\neconomy and collective agriculture. Ideally, the changes the Bolsheviks supported were intended\nto address the failures of Nicholas II providing more stable wages and food supplies. Rather than\nhaveindividualpeasantfarmsthathadlimitedinterconnectionsandpoorsystemsofdistribution,\nthe state would collectivize farming with several farming families collectively owning the land.\nUnder a command economy, the production, prices of goods, and wages received by workers\nis set by the government. In the Soviet Union, the government took control of all industries\nand invested heavily in the production of capital goods, those that are used to produce other\ngoods, such as machinery and tools. Though this system was intended to address concerns and\ninequalities that had developed under the tsars, the Soviet government under Stalin was fraught\nwith its own economic and social problems.\n3.4 RUSSIAN MULTICULTURALISM AND TENSION\nDuringtheperiodofRussia\u2019sexpansionanddevelopmentasanempire,andlaterduringthetime\nof the Soviet Union, Russia\u2019s territory included not only ethnic Russians but other surrounding\ngroups as well. Ethnicity is a key feature of cultural identity and refers to the identification of a\ngroup of people with a common language, ancestry, or cultural history. Many of these minority\nethnic groups harbored resentment over being controlled by an imperial power.\nPrior to the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian Empire\u2019s response to the non-Russian\ncommunities they controlled was known as Russification, where non-Russian groups give up\ntheir ethnic and linguistic identity and adopt the Russian culture and language. This type of policy\nis known as cultural assimilation, where one cultural group adopts the language and customs\nof another group. The Russian language was taught in schools and minority languages were\nbanned in public places. Catholic schools were banned and instead, Russian Orthodoxy, part of\nthe Eastern Orthodox Church, was taught at state-run schools. The Russian Empire essentially\nsought to make everyone in the territory Russian. This policy was only marginally successful,\nhowever, and was especially difficult to implement in the outer regions. 54 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nUndertheSovietUnion,thepolicyofculturalassimilationhadlesstodowithbecomingRussian\nand more to do with being part of the Soviet Union, what could be thought of as Sovietization.\nTheSovietgovernmentorganizedthecountryasafederation,whereterritorieswithinthecountry\nhad varying degrees of autonomy (see Figure 3.8). The larger ethnic groups formed the Soviet\nSocialistRepublics,orSSRs.TheUzbekSSR,forexample,largelycontainedmembersoftheUzbek\nethnic group. The Kazakh SSR similarly consisted mostly of people who were ethnically Kazakh.\nTheseSSRsdidnotrepresentalloftheethnicdiversitypresentinRussianordidtheyprovidethese\nterritories with autonomy. You might recognize the names of these republics as they gradually\nbecame independent states after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Turkmen SSR became\nTurkmenistan, for example. Many of these areas, particularly in Central Asia, are majority Muslim\nand thus adopted the Persian suffix \u201c-stan\u201d meaning \u201cplace of\u201d or \u201ccountry\u201d after independence.\nFigure 3.8: Map of the USSR (Courtesy of Perry-Casta\u00f1eda Library of the University of Texas at Austin, Public\nDomain)\nUnder Soviet Rule, some policies of Russification expanded. In Muslim areas of Central Asia\nand the Caucasus, the use of the Arabic alphabet, the language of the Qur\u2019an, was abolished.\nThe government also sent many Russians into majority non-Russian areas to further unify the\ncountry. Other ethnic groups, particularly those perceived as troublemakers by the government,\nwere deported from their ancestral homelands and resettled elsewhere. The ethnic map of the\nformerSovietUniontoday,inpart,reflectsthismulticulturalhistoryandthelegacyofresettlement\npolicies (see Figure 3.9). Over 3 million people were deported to Siberia between 1941 and 1949, RUSSIA 55\na large portion of whom died from disease or malnutrition. Others were deported from the\nBaltic area or from the area near the Black Sea. Overall, around 6 million people were internally\ndisplaced as a result of the Soviet Union\u2019s resettlement policies and between 1 and 1.5 million of\nthem died as a result.\nFigure 3.9: Ethnic Groups in the Former USSR (Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division, Public Domain)\nAlthough Russia today is comprised mostly of people who speak Russian and identify with the\nRussian ethnicity, it contains 185 different ethnic groups speaking over 100 different languages.\nThe largest minority groups in Russia are the Tatars, representing around 4 percent of the\npopulation with over 5 million people, and Ukrainians at around 1.4 percent or almost 2 million\npeople.Otherethnicgroups,liketheVotesnearSaintPetersburg,haveonlyafewdozenmembers\nremaining. Because of the Soviet resettlement policies, the former Soviet republics have sizable\nRussian minorities. Kazakhstan and Latvia, for example, are almost one-quarter Russian. This has\noften led to tension within Russia as minority groups have sought independence and outside of\nRussia as ethnic groups have clashed over leadership.\nIn Ukraine in particular, tension between the Ukrainian population and Russian minority has\nremained high and represents a broader tension between the Eastern European regions that\nare more closely aligned with Russia and those that seek greater connectivity and trade with\nWesternEurope.EasternUkraineislargelycomprisedofRussianspeakers,whileWesternUkraine 56 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\npredominantly speaks the state language of Ukrainian (see Figure 3.10). Overall, around three-\nquarters of people in Ukraine identify with the Ukrainian ethnicity.\nFigure 3.10: Map of the usage of the Russian language in Ukraine, 2003 (\u00a9 User:Russianname,\nWikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.5)\nIn 2014, the tension between the two groups escalated as then-president Victor Yanukovych\nbacked away from a deal to increase connections with the European Union and instead sought\ncloser ties with Russia. In Western Ukraine, people engaged in widespread protests prompting\nthe government to sign a set of anti-protest laws, while in Eastern Ukraine, most supported the\ngovernment. Ultimately, Yanukovych was removed from office prompting military intervention\nfrom Russia.\nSpecifically, Russia sought control of Crimea, an area that had been annexed by the Russian\nEmpire and was an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic until the 1950s when it was transferred\nto Ukraine. After the 2014 protests, a majority of the people of Crimea supported joining Russia\nanditwasformallyannexedbyRussianforces.TheregionisnowcontrolledbyRussia(seeFigure\n3.11). The international community, however, has largely not recognized Crimea\u2019s sovereignty or\nRussia\u2019s annexation. RUSSIA 57\nFigure 3.11: Map of Crimea (Derivative work from original by Crosswords, Wikimedia\nCommons)\nSeveral other ethnic groups that remain in Russia desire independence, particularly in the\noutskirts of the country in the Caucasus region along Russia\u2019s border with Georgia and Armenia\n(see Figure 3.12). Chechnya is largely comprised of Chechens, a distinct Sunni Muslim nation.\nThe territory opposed Russian conquest of the region in the 19th century but was forcefully\nincorporatedintotheSovietUnionintheearly20thcentury.400,000Chechensweredeportedby\nStalin in the 1940s and more than 100,000 died. Although Chechnya sought independence from\nRussia, sometimes through violent opposition, it has remained under Russian control following\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. Dagestan has been the site of several Islamic insurgencies\nseeking separation from Russia. Ossetia remains divided between a northern portion controlled\nby Russia and a southern region controlled by Georgia. 58 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 3.12: Map of the Caucasus Region (\u00a9 Jeroenscommons, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.5)\nIn an area as large and as ethnically diverse as Russia, controlling the territory in a way that is\nacceptable to all of its residents has proven difficult. In many large countries, the farther away\nyou get from the capital area and large cities, the more cultural differences you find. Some\ngovernments have embraced this cultural difference, creating autonomous regions that function\nlargely independently though remain part of the larger state. Stalin and Russia\u2019s tsars before him\ntried to unify the country through the suppression of ethnic difference, but ethnic and linguistic\nidentities are difficult to obliterate. RUSSIA 59\n3.5 ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION\nThe Soviet Government, led by Lenin and later by Stalin, advocated a communist system. In a\ncapitalistsystem,marketforcesdictatepricesaccordingtosupplyanddemand.Thosewhocontrol\nthemeansofproduction,knownasthebourgeoisieintheMarxistphilosophy,aremuchwealthier\nthan the workers, known as the proletariat. In a communist system, however, the means of\nproductionarecommunallyowned,andtheintendedresultisthattherearenoclassesofrichand\npoor and no groups of landowners and landless workers.\nIn reality, no government practices pure capitalism or pure communism, but rather,\ngovernments are situated along a continuum (see Figure 3.13). Anarchy, the absence of\ngovernment control, exists only in temporary situations, such as when a previous government\nis overthrown and political groups are vying for power. In most Western countries, a mix of\ncapitalismandsocialism,whereeconomicandsocialsystemsarecommunallyowned,ispracticed\nto varying degrees. Denmark, for example, which has been consistently ranked as one of the\nhappiest countries in the world, has a market economy with few business regulations but\ngovernment funded universal healthcare, unemployment compensation, and maternity leave,\nand most higher education is free. The United States is largely capitalist, but the government\nprovides retirement benefits through the social security system, funds the military, and supports\nthe building and maintenance of the interstate highway system. Although China\u2019s government\nis communist, it has also embraced elements of the market economy and allows some private\nenterprise as well as foreign trade and investment. All governments must address three basic\nquestionsofeconomics:whattoproduce,howtoproduce,andforwhomtoproduce.Theanswers\nto these questions vary depending on the state and the situation.\nFigure 3.13: Continuum of Government Control (Figure by author)\nIn the Soviet system, the government dictated economic policy, rather than relying on free\nmarket mechanisms and the law of supply and demand. This required the government to\nintervene at all levels of the economy. The prices of goods needed to be set by the central\ngovernment, the production levels of goods needed to be determined, the coordination of\nmanufacturers and distributors was needed \u2013 everything that is traditionally accomplished\nthroughprivateindividualsandcompaniesinacapitalistmodelwastheresponsibilityoftheSoviet\ngovernment.\nTo coordinate such a wide array of goods and services, long-term planning was needed. The\nSoviet government instituted a series of five-year plans which established long-term goals and\nemphasized quotas for the production of goods. This system lacked flexibility, however, and was\noften inefficient in its production and distribution of goods. 60 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nThe Soviet government had two principle objectives: first, to accelerate industrialization, and\nsecondly,tocollectivizeagriculture.Thecollectivizationofagriculture,thoughintendedtoincrease\ncrop yields and make distribution of food more efficient, was ultimately a failure. By the early\n1930s, 90 percent of agricultural land in the Soviet Union had become collectivized, meaning\nowned by a collection of people rather than individuals. Every element of the production of\nagriculture, from the tractors to the livestock, was collectivized rather than individually owned. A\nfamily could not even have its own vegetable garden. Ideally, under such a system, all farmers\nwould work equally and would share the benefits equally.\nUnfortunately,theearningsofcollectivefarmerswastypicallylessthanprivatefarmers.Thisled\ntoareductioninagriculturaloutputaswellasareductioninthenumberoflivestock.Coupledwith\napoorharvestintheearly1930s,thecountryexperiencedwidespreadfamineandfoodinsecurity.\nIt is estimated that 12 million people died as a result of the collectivization of agriculture.\nSovietindustrialdevelopment,too,wasplaguedwithinefficiencies.Inatypicalmarketeconomy,\nparticularplacesspecializeintheproductionofcertaingoodsandthesystemworksoutthemost\nefficient method of production and distribution. A furniture maker might locate near a supply\nof hardwood, for example, to minimize transportation costs. A large factory might locate near a\nhydroelectricplanttoensureaninexpensivepowersource.Certainplaces,duetoluckorphysical\ngeography,havemoreresourcesthanothersandthiscanleadtoregionalimbalances.TheSoviet\ngovernment, however, wanted everything and everyone to be equal. If one region had all of the\nindustrial development, then the people in that region would be disproportionately wealthy and\nthe region would be more vulnerable to attack by an outside force. The government also hoped\nthatthedispersalofindustrywouldforcethecountrytobeinterconnected.Ifoneareahadasteel\nplant and another had a factory that used steel to produce machines, the two would have to rely\non one another and neither would have an advantage. Thus, they aimed to disperse industrial\ndevelopment across the country.\nIf you were a geographer tasked with finding the best location for a new industry, you\u2019d likely\ntake into account underlying resources, such as the raw materials needed for manufacturing and\nthe energy needed to power the factory. You might think about labor supplies and try to locate\ntheindustrynearalargelaborpool.Youmightalsothinkabouthowtogetthegoodtoconsumers\nefficiently, and locate near a shipping port or rail line. Rather than take these geographic factors\ninto account, however, the Soviet government sought to disperse industry as much as possible.\nIndustrieswerelocatedwithlittleregardforthelocationoflabororrawmaterials.Thismeantthat\ninefficiencies were built into the system, and unnecessary transportation costs\nmounted.\nThe substantial costs of supporting an inefficient system of industrial development were\nmagnified by the costs needed to fund the Cold War. The Cold War occurred following World\nWar II and was a time of political and military tension primarily between the United States and\nthe Soviet Union. Western Europe, which was largely capitalist, was divided from the communist\nSoviet Union by the so-called Iron Curtain, a dividing line between the Soviet Union and its\nsatellite states who aligned with the Warsaw Pact, a collective defense treaty, and Western\nEuropeancountriesalliedthroughtheNorthAtlanticTreatyOrganization(NATO)(seeFigure3.14).\nTheColdWarwassonamedbecauseitwasdifferentfromatraditional\u201chot\u201dwarinthatitdidnot\ninvolve direct military conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. It did, however, RUSSIA 61\nresult in armed conflicts in other parts of the world as well as a massive stockpile of military\nweaponry.\nFigure 3.14: Map of Cold War Military Alliances\n(Derivative work from original by S\u00e9mhur,\nWikimedia Commons)\nDuringthe1980s,SovietleaderMikhailGorbachevsupportedrestructuringtheSovieteconomy\nwith a series of some market-like reforms, known as Perestroika. He also supported glasnost,\nan increase in government transparency and openness. Unfortunately, these reforms could not\nchange the system quickly enough and loosened government controls only worsened the\ncondition and inefficiencies of the Soviet economy.\nThe Soviet government, already stretched thin financially from a system of development that\nlargely ignored geography, could not support the unprofitable state-supported enterprises and\nmounting military expenses. Ultimately, the country went bankrupt. In a system where every\naspectoftheeconomyislinked,itonlytakesonelinktobreakthechainandfar-fromGorbachev\u2019s\npolicies strengthening the chain, Perestroika only weakened it further. The Soviet Union formally\ndissolved in 1991. Some have argued that the Soviet Union collapsed economically. Others\nmaintainthatitwasprimarily apolitical collapse,ledbyanineffectivegovernmentandincreasing\nterritorial resistance. Geography largely played a role as well, with the government ignoring\nfundamental principles of spatial location and interaction.\n3.6 THE MODERN RUSSIAN LANDSCAPE\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union had far-reaching effects on the Russian landscape and even\ntoday, Russia is affected by the legacy of the Soviet Union. The remnants of Soviet bureaucracy,\nfor example, affect everything from the cost of road building to the forms needed to get clothes\ndry cleaned. After the immediate collapse of the Soviet Union, the government transitioned to a\nmarketeconomy.Inmanycases,thosewhohadpositionsofpowerwithintheSovietgovernment 62 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\ngained control over previously state-owned industries creating a wealthy class often called a\nRussian oligarchy. Despite some setbacks and global economic downturns, Russia\u2019s economy\nhas improved significantly since the end of the Soviet Union and Russia now has the sixth-\nlargesteconomyintheworld. Povertyandunemployment rateshavealsofallen sharply inrecent\ndecades. Although Russia\u2019s population fell sharply following the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, it has\nrebounded somewhat in recent years.\nAbandoned industrial towns and work settlements built by the Soviet Union dot the landscape,\nevidence of the Soviet government\u2019s ill-fated attempt to decentralize its population and\ndevelopment (see Figure 3.15). The Trans-Siberian Railway, completed in 1916 to connect\nMoscow with Russia\u2019s eastern reaches in Vladivostok, continues to be the most important\ntransportation link in Russia, but Russia\u2019s highway system remains largely centralized in the west.\nIntheeast,thedecentralizationofsettlementsanddifficultphysicalconditionshasmadebuilding\nandmaintainingroadnetworksdifficult.TheLenaHighway,forexample,nicknamedthe\u201cHighway\nfromHell,\u201disafederalhighwayrunning1,235km(767mi)northtosouthineasternSiberia.Itwas\njust a dirt road until 2014, often turning into an impassible, muddy swamp in summer.\nFigure 3.15: Abandoned Apartment Buildings in Kadykchan, Russia (\u00a9 Laika ac, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n2.0) RUSSIA 63\nUnderVladimirPutin,Russia\u2019s2ndand4thpresident,Russia\u2019seconomyhasgrownconsistently,\naided by high oil prices and global oil demand. Putin also instituted police and military reforms,\nand persecuted some of the wealthy oligarchs who had taken control of private enterprises.\nCritics also note that Putin has enacted a number of laws seeking to quiet political dissent and\npersonal freedoms. There have been numerous documented cases of the torture of prisoners\nand members of the armed forces as well as a number of suspicious killings of journalists and\nlawmakers.\nAlthough the Cold War officially ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union, tension between\nRussia and the West remains high. Military conflict in the former Soviet states, like Ukraine, has\noften reignited simmering hostilities. Still, there is some evidence of cooperation. In 2015, Putin\ntold fellow world leaders that climate change was \u201cone of the gravest challenges humanity is\nfacing\u201d and backed the United Nation\u2019s climate change agreement. Previously, Putin had stated\nthat for a country as cold as Russia, global warming would simply mean that Russians would\nhave to buy fewer fur coats. The U.S. and Russian space agencies also continue to work together,\nannouncing plans to cooperatively build a new space station.

These trees are also exceptionally old. One such\ntree,knownas\u201cGeneralSherman,\u201disthelargesttreeintheworldbyvolumeandisbelievedtobe\nover2,000yearsold.AtthetimeGeneralShermanfirstemergedfromtheground,NorthAmerica\nwas settled by a number of indigenous groups. It would be 1,000 more years until Europeans\nwould make contact with the Americas. Today, though many of the redwoods still remain, both\nthe physical and human landscape of North America have profoundly changed.\nTraditionally, the continent of North America extends from the Canadian Arctic through the\nUnited States and Mexico to the narrow Isthmus of Panama (see Figure 4.1). When considering\nthe \u201cregion\u201d of North America, however, that is, the area united by common physical and cultural\ncharacteristics, there are distinct similarities between Canada and the United States in terms of\nlanguage and a shared history that are quite different from their Spanish-speaking neighbors\nto the south. Although the narrow strip of land that typically divides North and South America\nmakes for an easy way to divide these two regions, in many ways, Middle America is largely a\ntransition zone between more powerful economies to the north and south. Mexico, for example,\nculturallyresemblescountrieslikeGuatemalaandHondurastothesouthwhilephysiographically,\nit resembles the southwestern United States. Thus, the United States and Canada are discussed\n64 NORTH AMERICA 65\nin the North America chapter while Mexico and Central America are considered alongside the\nchapter on South America.\nFigure 4.1: Map of North America, 1:36,000,000 scale (Derivative work from original by CIA World Factbook, Public\nDomain)\nThe physiographic regions of North America are well-defined and are commonly recognized by\nits residents (see Figure 4.2). Someone might say he is from \u201cAppalachia,\u201d for example, or that\nshe grew up in the \u201cRocky Mountains.\u201d In general, the physiographic regions have a strong north-\nsouthalignment.Climatically,theregionisquitediverse,rangingfromtundrainnorthernCanada 66 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nand Greenland to semi-arid desert in the southwestern United States.

For Canada\u2019s indigenous communities in particular, this large stretch of\nwoodland has been an important resource. The rocky landscape of the Canadian Shield extends\nfrom the Arctic regions of Central Canada west through Quebec and is among the oldest geologic\nformations on Earth. It also has some of the world\u2019s richest mineral areas.

San\nFrancisco is located on this fault line and the area has experienced numerous earthquakes. 68 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 4.4: Map of the North American Tectonic Plates (Derivative work from original by Alataristarion, Wikimedia\nCommons)\nNorth America has a number of significant rivers, some of which are used for shipping and\nothers for hydroelectric power. The longest North American river is the Missouri, which forms in\nMontana and flows into the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River is largely considered to be the\nmost important waterway in terms of commercial transportation. The Port of South Louisiana,\nlocated along the Mississippi, is the largest port in the United States in terms of tonnage. NORTH AMERICA 69\nBelow North America lies a number of aquifers, or underground layers of permeable rock\nthat hold groundwater. The largest of these aquifers is the Ogallala Aquifer located in the central\nUnited States stretching from South Dakota down to Texas. This aquifer supplies water to much\nof the Great Plains \u2013 it actually supplies about one-third of all groundwater used for irrigation in\nthe United States. While aquifers are beneficial for irrigation, they replenish their water supplies\nrelatively slowly through rainfall. Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer has accelerated over the\npast few decades and currently water is being taken out of the aquifer at a faster rate than it\ncan be replaced. Once all of the water is depleted, it will take around 6,000 years to naturally\nreplenish. Groundwater conservation initiatives intheareahaveaimedtoslowthedepletion rate\nby encouraging farmers to practice sustainable irrigation methods.\nWhile farmers have been encouraged to conserve water, groundwater depletion is just one\nof the many environmental concerns currently facing North America\u2019s farmers. Sustainable\nagriculture more broadly remains an important initiative. This type of agriculture looks at\nfarming\u2019s effect on the larger ecosystem and seeks to produce agriculture in a way that doesn\u2019t\nnegatively impact the ecosystem in the long-term. It is essentially farming that can be sustained\nand seeks to minimize water use, soil erosion, and harmful chemicals. Globally, over one-third of\nall agricultural land has become degraded due to poor land and resource management. Soil is a\nfiniteresource,andtopsoilcantakeover500yearstoform!Traditionalformsofagriculture,where\nyoumightseelargestretchesoftilledland,canoftenleadtotopsoilerosion.Throughsustainable\nagricultural practices, soil erosion rates have slowed in the United States over the past several\ndecades.\nMany environmental problems like topsoil erosion and groundwater depletion affect a wide\narea and can have far-reaching effects beyond areas where the environment is not being\nsensitively managed. Acid rain, for example, formed from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide\nemissions, can have damaging effects far beyond the areas that are emitting these gases (see\nFigure 4.5). When cars or factories burn fossil fuels, those nonrenewable sources of energy\nformedbytheremainsofdecayedplantsoranimals,theyreleaseanumberofchemicalsincluding\nsulfur and nitrogen. These gases react with water in the atmosphere to form a highly acidic rain\nthatcandamageplantsandanimals.ThelowerthepHvalue,themoreacidicasubstanceis;pure\nwater has a pH of 7. Acid rain can have a pH of around 5.0, or even below 4.0 in some areas.\nPickles, by comparison, have a pH of around 5.20, so you can imagine the devastating effects of\nthisacidicprecipitationontheenvironment.Thestrictregulationoffossilfuelemissionssincethe\n1970s has dramatically reduced instances of acid rain in the United States but some argue that\nfurther regulation is needed to address changes in global climate and other pollution concerns. 70 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 4.5: Map of Acid Rain in the United States (National Atmospheric Deposition Program\/National Trends\nNetwork, Public Domain)\n4.2 NORTH AMERICAN HISTORY AND SETTLEMENT\nAlthough Christopher Columbus is often credited with \u201cdiscovering\u201d America, the landmass was\ninhabited long before Europeans made contact. Most likely, early migrants to the Americas\ntraveled from Asia through the Beringia land bridge that once connected Siberia and Alaska\nover 10,000 years ago. These indigenous peoples, known as First Nations in Canada or Native\nAmericans in the United States, were divided into a number of different groups, some consisting\nonly of a few small families and others encompassing vast territories and empires (see Figure\n4.6).Somegroupspracticedhuntingandgatheringbutmanypracticedsettledagriculture.Before\nEuropeancontact,therewereanestimated50millionindigenouspeoplelivinginNorthandSouth\nAmerica. NORTH AMERICA 71\nFigure 4.6: North American Indigenous Cultural Areas (Derivative work from original by Spacenut525, Wikimedia\nCommons)\nEuropean colonization completely changed the cultural landscape of North America. In 1492\nCE, Columbus made contact with what are now the Bahamas, Cuba, and the island of Hispaniola,\nspurring Spanish and Portuguese colonization of the Americas. The term \u201cIndian\u201d was actually\noriginally used by Columbus who thought he had arrived in the East Indies, what we now refer\nto as East and Southeast Asia. Early French and English settlements were not successful, but\novertime,theytoogainedcontrolofterritoryandfoundedpermanentcolonies.Theeasternmost\nindigenous groups were the first to experience the impacts of European invasion. Many were 72 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nrelocated,oftenforcibly,totheinteriorofNorthAmericatofreeuplandforEuropeansettlement.\nDisease and war would have a devastating effect on the indigenous groups of the Americas.\nEuropean settlers and explorers brought smallpox, measles, and cholera \u2013 diseases previously\nunknown to North America. In some areas, 90 percent of the indigenous population died.\nBy the early 1700s, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain had established formal colonies in\nthe Americas (see Figure 4.7) and the population geography of North America today is largely\nrooted in the colonial developments during this time period. The British primarily set up\nsettlements along the coast, including the thirteen colonies that would declare independence\nfrom the United Kingdom and form the basis of the United States. The French colonized much of\nCanada and the area surrounding the Mississippi River. Their primary objective was fur trading,\nand they founded a fur trading outpost at what would later become the city of Quebec. The\nSpanish colonized present-day Florida as well as much of Middle America, stretching into what is\nnowthesouthwesternUnitedStates.Theysoughtresourceslikegold,theexpansionoftrade,and\nopportunities to spread the Roman Catholic faith to indigenous groups.\nFigure 4.7: Map of North American Colonies, 1750 (Derivative work from original by Pinpin, Wikimedia Commons)\nThe early British colonies had highly specialized economies, not unlike the patterns seen in\npresent-day North America. The New England colonies, around the Massachusetts Bay area,\nwere centers of commerce. The Chesapeake Bay area of Virginia and Maryland had a number\nof tobacco plantations. In the Middle Atlantic, around New York, New Jersey, and eastern NORTH AMERICA 73\nPennsylvania,wereanumberofsmall,independent-farmercolonies.Furthersouth,theCarolinas\nwere home to large plantations cultivating crops like cotton.\nThese large plantations relied on slave labor, a dark legacy that would last for 250 years in\nNorthAmerica.Initially,colonistspartneredwithindenturedservants.Theselaborerspaidtotheir\npassage to North America by agreeing to work for an employer under contract for a set number\nofyears.Theseindenturedservantsoftenworkedonfarms,andoncetheircontractexpired,they\nwere free to work on their own. Over half of all European immigrants to the Americas before the\nAmerican Revolution were indentured servants.\nAsindenturedservantsgraduallyearnedtheirfreedom,thesystemofindenturedservitudewas\nreplaced with slavery. The Portuguese were the first to bring slaves from Africa to the Americas\nduring the 1500s. England, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands would all later join in the\ntransatlantic slave trade, with England dominating the slave trade by the late 17th century. The\nvast majority of slaves were destined for sugar colonies in the Caribbean and Brazil. Less than\n10 percent would be brought to the North American colonies, but this number still represented\nhundredsofthousandsofpeople.Itisestimatedthatatotalof12.5millionAfricanswereshipped\nto the New World as slaves.\nDuring British colonization, slaves worked as house servants or laborers in the northern\ncolonies and farm workers in the south. Britain formally abolished slavery in 1833, but slavery\nwas so entrenched in the economies of the southern United States that it would take a civil war\nto end the practice. In their secession statement, Mississippi explained its reasoning for leaving\nthe union: \u201cIn the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with\nthe government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the\nprominent reasons which have induced our course. Our position is thoroughly identified with the\ninstitution of slavery \u2013 the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product\nwhich constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth\u201d\n(http:\/\/avalon.law.yale.edu\/19th_century\/csa_missec.asp).\nWhen we think about the Civil War, it is important to understand the geographical differences\nbetween the north and south and to remember that the northern states profited on slavery in\nthe south. Just as geographers can divide the world into core and peripheral countries today, the\nearly United States can similarly be analyzed in terms of its core and periphery. The southern\nstates were indeed peripheral in terms of their economic development. Slavery, essentially free\nlabor, provided the southern states with the maximum profit for their commodities and the\nnotion of \u201cothering,\u201d the idea that people who look different from you are definitively not you,\ncombined to create an institution that was deeply a part of the southern culture and economy.\nEven after slavery was abolished in the United States in 1865 with the 13th Amendment to the\nConstitution, the legacy of slavery and the tendency to consider African Americans as \u201cother\u201d\nremained.Itwouldbeanother100yearsbeforelawswerepassedintheUnitedStatesthatwould\nbardiscriminationbasedonrace,color,religion,sex,ornationalorigin.Evenstill,racialandethnic\nprejudices continue to be a significant social issue. 74 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n4.3 INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA\nAs the Industrial Revolution began in the United Kingdom in the mid-1700s and spread across\nEurope,theUnitedStateswasstillprimarilybasedonagricultureandnaturalresourceproduction.\nSome of the early innovations in industry were thus based on these raw resources, such as\nthe cotton mill and textile factories. Hydropower was the key source of energy for these early\nmanufacturing plants and thus they were located almost exclusively in the northeastern United\nStates, the only area with fast-moving rivers. After the Civil War in the 1860s, steam power\nmanufacturingspreadthroughtheUnitedStatesallowingthesouthernstatestoindustrialize.The\nmanufacturing core region in particular had high concentrations of industrial output (see Figure\n4.8).Eventually,astheUnitedStatescontinuedtoindustrialize,theyovertooktheUnitedKingdom\nby the early 20th century as the global leader in industry.\nFigure 4.8: Map of the North American Manufacturing Core Region (Derivative work from original by Lokal Profil,\nWikimedia Commons)\nThe geography of North America shaped industrial development and regional specializations.\nIn the Pittsburgh-Lake Erie region, for example, abundant deposits of iron fueled steel\nmanufacturing, inspiring the name of Pittsburgh\u2019s professional football team. In the south, textile NORTH AMERICA 75\nmanufacturing developed and remains a regional specialty in many areas still today. Coal from\nAppalachia fueled industrial development in the Mid-Atlantic States. These regional\nspecializations, and the fact that the southern states continued to rely on agricultural production\nfor some time, further exacerbated economic differences between the north and south.\nThe Industrial Revolution shaped the pattern of human settlement in North America. As in\nEurope, industrial development occurred in urban areas spurring people to move from rural\nfarming communities to the cities to find work. In 1790, around 5 percent of the US population\nlived in urban areas. At the end of the Civil War, as industrialization began to diffuse across the\ncontinent,around20percentlivedincities.By1920,morepeoplelivedincitiesthaninruralareas.\nToday, over 80 percent of people in the US live in cities.\nIn addition, industrial development spurred large-scale migration, particularly from the\nperipheral regions of Eastern Europe, as people moved to the US to find work. Between 1865\nand 1918, 27.5 million people migrated to the US. Conditions for many of these workers was\ndismal and child labor wouldn\u2019t end until 1930. Asians primarily migrated to the western United\nStates where they were often met with strong anti-immigrant sentiment. Legislation actually\nlimited immigration from China and Japan at the turn of the 20th century. Improvements in rail\ntransportation further diffused both industrial development and the population of workers.\nFor the past several decades, manufacturing has been declining in the United States as people\nhave shifted to jobs in service industries, like retail and finance. Still, the US remains the world\u2019s\nsecondlargestmanufacturerbehindChina.Thisprocessisreferredtoasdeindustrializationand\nisaccompaniedbybothsocialandeconomicchangesasacountryshiftsfromheavyindustrytoa\nmore service-oriented economy.\n4.4 THE NORTH AMERICAN URBAN LANDSCAPE\nNorth America\u2019s urban landscape has been shaped both by colonization and by industrialization.\nMostoftheearlysettlementsintheregionweresmallandwerelocatedclosetotheeasterncoast.\nThe Appalachian Mountains provided a formidable obstacle for early settlers before 1765. As\nsettlement and colonization expanded, people moved steadily westward, still primarily situating\nclose to waterways. Even today, most urban centers are located close to water.\nDuring this time, immigration and natural growth expanded North America\u2019s population. In\n1610,thepopulationofwhatisnowtheUnitedStates,excludingindigenousgroups,wasameager\n350 people. In just 200 years, the population reached over 7 million. In 1620, just 60 people\noccupied what is now the Canadian city of Quebec. Today, the population of the United States\nstandsatover318millionandCanada\u2019spopulationisover35millionandbothcountriesarehighly\nurbanized.\nNorthAmerica\u2019scitiesthemselveshavealsochangedovertime.Thetraditional NorthAmerican\ncity had a core commercial area, called the central business district (or CBD), surrounded by\nworker\u2019shomes.Densitywasgenerallyhighestnearthecitycenteranddecreasedasyoutraveled\noutward away from the urban center and into the rural areas.\nAs deindustrialization occurred, suburbanization replaced the previous rural to urban\nmigration. The rush to move to the city center for jobs in industry was replaced by the desire\nfor more land and spacious, single-family homes. With the decrease in housing density and the 76 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nincrease in both home size and acreage, however, came sprawl. Urban sprawl refers to the\nexpansion of human settlements away from central cities and into low-density, car-dependent\ncommunities. Sprawl is associated with urban decentralization, the spreading out of the\npopulationthatresultedfromsuburbanization.Counterurbanization,theshiftinpopulationsfrom\nurban centers to suburban and rural settlements, has been prevalent in North America since\nthe end of World War II. In some areas, rural populations have actually grown as a result of\ncounterurbanization. As sprawl continued, edge cities developed. An edge city is an urban area\nsituated outside of the traditional central business district.\nIn historical North American cities, the central city was home to most of the jobs and services\nand had relatively high density housing. Because everything was located close to the city center,\npeoplecouldoftenwalkfromhometoworkortakeefficienttransitsystemslikestreetcars.Urban\ndecentralization has not only resulted in sprawl but has also created suburbs that are entirely\ndependent on automobiles (seeFigure 4.9).\nFigure 4.9: Suburban Development in Colorado Springs, Colorado (\u00a9 David Shankbone, Wikimedia Commons, CC\nBY-SA 3.0)\nFewsuburbshaveshopsorrestaurants,andmostpeoplelivinginsuburbshavetocommuteto\nwork. Since jobs are no longer clustered in the city center, cities have faced challenges trying to\ndevelop mass transit systems that tie together numerous disconnected suburban developments NORTH AMERICA 77\nand link people with their places of work, many of which are now located in surrounding edge\ncities.\nToronto, for example, Canada\u2019s largest city, has a population of 2.8 million within its city\nlimits. Its surrounding suburbs, however, have grown considerably in recent decades. The entire\nmetropolitan area now has a population of over 5.5 million and the average daily commute time\nis over 1 hour. To the south, Washington, DC\u2019s urban decentralization has extended north into\nMaryland and south into Virginia. Its subway system, a technological marvel when it opened in\n1976,hasnotkeptpacewithitsurbangrowthandnumeroussectionsofraillineswereshutdown\nfor an extended period in 2016 and again in 2019 to conduct major system and station repairs.\nIn some areas, the metropolitan area has grown so large that it actually overlaps with\nneighboring metropolitan areas. This is referred to as a megalopolis. The Northeast Megalopolis\nextends along the Interstate 95 corridor from the southern suburbs of Washington, DC north\nthrough Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York to Boston (see Figure 4.10). It covers about 2\npercent of the land area in the United States but is home to over 50 million people, around 16\npercent of the US population. It is projected to grow to 58 million people by 2025. The Northeast\nMegalopolis is just one of many growing urban areas in North America.

In the United States alone, more than 600 towns and villages have been\ndeveloped following the New Urbanist principles. Celebration, Florida, for example, near Orlando\nwas designed and built by the Walt Disney Company and includes a variety of apartments and\nsingle-family homes in close proximity to shops, restaurants, and a movie theater \u2013 all of which\nare in walking distance for residents (see Figure 4.11). In other areas, New Urbanism is more NORTH AMERICA 79\nbroadly integrated into long-term urban plans. One criticism of New Urbanist developments is\nthat while on the surface, they promote mixed income developments, in practice most housing\nin these areas are for the middle and upper classes. Housing prices in these developments are\nsimply beyond the reach of many low income families.\nFigure 4.11: Market Street in Celebration, Florida (\u00a9 Simonhardt93, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nAs urban to suburban migration continued, some desired instead to move back from the\nsprawling suburbs to be closer to the amenities of the downtown area. This often led to\ngentrification, where increased property values displace lower-income families and small\nbusinesses.Initially,low-income,historichousingnearthecitycenterattractedmiddle-andupper-\nincome families. As these families moved in and renovated the housing, other families did the\nsame. Over time, this renovation increased property values \u2013 an advantage for city officials who\nsaw an increase in property tax revenue. For the poorest in the communities, however, this\nincrease in property values often meant that they could no longer afford to rent near the central\ncity. Given the auto-dependency of the sprawling suburbs, where would someone live if they\nhad no transportation and worked in the downtown area? The walkability of the downtown, an\namenity for those relocating from the suburbs, was often a necessity for low-income workers. 80 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nGentrification also changes the racial and ethnic makeup of neighborhoods, as most people\nmoving into these changing urban areas are typically white. The Bedford- Stuyvesant area of\nBrooklyn, for example, was traditionally an African American community but beginning in the\n2000s, began to experience gentrification (seeFigure\n4.12).Thepercentageofwhiteresidentsincreasedfrom2.4percentin2000to22percentin2013.\nMedian home prices jumped, too, from $400,000 in 2011 to $765,000\nin 2016. New businesses have located in the area and the gentrification has funded major\ninfrastructure improvements. For the neighborhood\u2019s poorest residents, however, these\nimprovements have pushed housing and rent prices beyond what they can afford.\nFigure 4.12: Gentrified Neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York\n(\u00a9 Mark Hogan, Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0)\n4.5 PATTERNS OF INEQUALITY IN NORTH AMERICA\nWhile both Canada and the United States have relatively strong economies, income inequality\npersists. In the United States in particular, around 12 percent of people live below the poverty\nline.Someargue,however,thatthetraditionaldefinitionof\u201cliving belowthepovertyline\u201dhasnot NORTH AMERICA 81\nkept up with rising living costs and inflation and that the actual percentage of Americans living in\nor near poverty is far higher. This income inequality is geographical, with the states in the south\nhaving significantly greater concentrations of people in poverty that the rest of the country (see\nFigure 4.13). These regional differences are connected to historical differences in development.\nJust as the northern areas were the first to industrialize, they were the first areas to transition\nto more higher-income service industries. Although areas like Silicon Valley in California and the\nAustin-San Antonio region of Texas have had an influx of high-tech industries, some areas of\nthe south have been slow to transition from primarily agricultural and natural resource based\neconomies.\nFigure 4.13: Map of Poverty in the United States, 2015 (United States Census Bureau, U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Public Domain) 82 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nCanada\u2019s poverty rate is lower than the United States at around 10 percent. In general, Canada\nhas stronger social welfare programs than the US. All provinces of Canada provide universal,\npublicly funded healthcare, for example, and a monthly income is provided to those in extreme\npoverty.\nHowever,inboththeUnitedStatesandCanada,incomeinequalityiscloselytiedtoethnicityand\nrace. For Canada\u2019s First Nations, however, poverty and homelessness rates are much higher than\nthe national average. Half of all indigenous children in Canada live in poverty. In some areas, like\nManitoba and Saskatchewan, the number is over 60 percent. In the US, the poverty rate among\nnon-Hispanic whites was just over 10 percent in 2014. For black Americans, the poverty rate was\n26 percent. By some measures, the US has the highest degree of income inequality among the\nadvanced economies of the world. In Canada, the richest 10 percent own 57.4 percent of the\ncountry\u2019swealth.IntheUnitedStates,therichest10percentownover75percentofthewealthin\nthe country, the highest of the twenty most developed countries in the world.\n4.6 NORTH AMERICA\u2019S GLOBAL CONNECTIONS\nNorth America continues to have a significant role in global trade and influence. Both Canada\nand the United States are members of the Group of Eight (G8), a political forum of the world\u2019s\nleadingindustrializedcountriesthatalsoincludesFrance,Germany,Italy,Japan,Russia,theUnited\nKingdom, and the European Union. Both are also members of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), an intergovernmental organization that collectively regulates international trade (see\nFigure 4.14).\nFigure 4.14: Map of the World Trade Organization (\u00a9 Tsui, Wikimedia Commons,CC BY-SA 3.0)\nWithin North America, trade has been governed under the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This agreement was\nestablished in 1994 with the goal of increasing economic cooperation between the three NORTH AMERICA 83\ncountries. Prior to NAFTA, although the US and Canada engaged in free trade, goods bought and\nsold between Mexico and the US were subject to tariffs, or additional taxes. In 2018, NAFTA was\nreplaced by theUnited States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement(USMCA) as a result of a renegotiation\nof NAFTA sought by US President Donald Trump.\nNAFTA has had generally positive impacts on the economies of the region. Canada\u2019s\nmanufacturing output held steady despite global decreases in productivity. Mexico\u2019s\nmaquiladoras, manufacturing plants that take components of products and assemble them for\nexport,havebecomeafixtureofitslandscapeespecially alongtheborder.TheUnitedStatesalso\nsaw a modest economic boost from the agreement.\nAfter the Cold War, the United States retained its position as a global superpower. It has the\nlargest economy of any other country, including the combined output of the European Union,\naccounting for 25 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). It leads the world in\nmilitary expenditures, and by many measures, is the most influential country in the world.\nHowever,italsohasthelargestprisonpopulationandhasamuchhigherinfantmortalityratethan\nmost other industrialized countries with strong regional concentrations of high infant mortality.\nSomewonder if theUSwill retain itsglobal dominance in thecoming decades, orif itwill become\none country among many influential world leaders.\nBothCanadaandtheUnitedStatescontinuetoattractimmigrants,drawntothesecountriesby\nthehopeofgoodjobsandpoliticalfreedoms.Eachcountryhasdealtwiththeinfluxofimmigration\nin very different ways. Over 200,000 people immigrate to Canada every year and the Canadian\nimmigration system gives preference to immigrants for skilled professions. Around 20 percent of\nCanada\u2019s population is foreign born, the highest of the G8 countries. Canada\u2019s immigrants have\nshaped its cultural landscape and have created a rich cultural mosaic. In contrast, immigrants to\nthe United States have generally been expected to assimilate, creating a relatively homogeneous\ncultural landscape rather than retaining individual ethnic identities. This notion of mixing cultural\ngroups to create a more homogeneous national culture is metaphorically termed amelting pot.\nCanada and the United States\u2019 reactions to refugees have also been markedly different. The\nUnitedStatessetagoalofaccepting10,000Syrianrefugees,butimmigrationfromSyriahasbeen\ncontentious politically with some fearing the potential for terrorist attacks by migrants. Several\nstategovernorsoutrightrefusedtoacceptSyrianrefugees.TheCanadiangovernment,incontrast,\nagreed to resettle 25,000 Syrians in 2016. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau greeted the\nfirst plane of refugees, offering winter clothing and stuffed animals and saying, \u201cWelcome home.\u201d\nThroughout history, Canada has welcomed the world\u2019s displaced peoples, accepting 1.2 million\nrefugees since World War II.\nUndocumented, or illegal, immigration to the United States continues to be another significant\npolitical issue. Around 11 million undocumented migrants currently live in the US. Just over 50\npercent are from Mexico. As drug crime worsened in Central America, undocumented migration\nfrom those countries surged and many now make a long and dangerous trek from Central\nAmerica through Mexico in hope of reaching US soil. Undocumented and unaccompanied child\nmigrants in particular have increased dramatically in recent years. As countries experience\neconomic decline, political turmoil, and often dangerous living conditions, migrants will likely\ncontinue to flock to Canada and the US in search of a better life.

Generally, the continents of North American and\nSouth America are divided at the Isthmus of Panama, the narrow strip of land that connects the\ntwolargelandmasses.Culturally,though,MiddleAmerica,includingtheCaribbean,isquitesimilar\nto South America and this region shares a distinct pattern of colonial development.\n84 MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 85\nFigure 5.1: Map of Middle and South America (CIA World Factbook, Public Domain)\n\u201cMiddleAmerica\u201distypicallydefinedastheareabetweenNorthandSouthAmerica,withMexico\nsometimes categorized as North America and sometimes as Middle or Central America. Since\nMexicosharesstrongculturalandhistoricalsimilaritieswiththecountriesofCentralAmerica,they\nare grouped together in this text. This region also includes the islands of the Caribbean. South of\nMiddle America is the continent of South America, extending from the the tropical sand beaches\nof Colombia to the frigid islands of southern Chile and Argentina.\nThe region lies at the intersection of a number of tectonic plates making the region vulnerable\nto earthquakes and volcanoes (see Figure 5.2). Haiti, for example, located on the eastern half of 86 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nthe island of Hispaniola, is situated on the edge of the Caribbean plate along a transform plate\nboundary. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck here in 2010 killing over 100,000 people.\nFigure 5.2: Tectonic Plate Boundaries in Middle and South America (CIA World Factbook, Public\nDomain)\nThesetectoniccollisionshavecreatedalandscapeofrelativelyhighrelief,particularly inMiddle\nAmericaandwesternSouthAmerica.Mexicoishometoanumberofimpressivemountainranges,\nincluding the Sierra Madre Occidental in the west, Sierra Madre Oriental in the east, and Sierra\nMadre del Sur in the south (seeFigure 5.3).

Many of these islands are the tops of underwater\nmountains. The islands of the Caribbean are divided into the Greater Antilles and the Lesser\nAntilles (see Figure 5.4). The Greater Antilles include the larger islands of Cuba, Jamaica,\nHispaniola,andtheCaymanIslands.TheLesserAntillesaremuchsmallerandincludetheLeeward\nand Windward Islands, the Leeward Antilles, and the Bahamas. 88 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 5.4: Map of the Greater and Lesser Antilles (\u00a9 Kmusser, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nIn addition to earthquakes and volcanoes, the region is prone to tropical cyclones, also known\nas hurricanes. The areas along the Gulf of Mexico, in particular, lie in the path of frequent\nhurricanes. El Ni\u00f1o, the warming phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, also\ncontributes to severe weather in the region. In North America, El Ni\u00f1o results in warmer than\naverage temperatures, but it can also increase the number of tropical cyclones in the Americas\nand excessive rain across South America.\nThe high relief of Central America has created distinct agricultural and livestock zones, known\nas altitudinal zonation. As altitude increases, temperature decreases, and thus each altitudinal\nzonecansupportdifferentcropsandanimals(seeFigure5.5).Thehot,coastalareaknownasthe\ntierra caliente, for example, can support tropical crops like bananas and rice.

MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 89\nFigure 5.5: Altitudinal zones in Central and South America (\u00a9 Chris.urs-o, Maksim, and Anita\nGraser; Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nSouth America\u2019s Andes Mountains, which stretch from Venezuela down to Chile and Argentina,\nwere formed from the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates below the South American\nplate. They are the highest mountains outside of Asia. Situated in the Andes is the Altiplano, a\nseries of high elevation plains. These wide basins were central to early human settlement of the\ncontinent.\nThe rest of South America is relatively flat. The Amazon basin is the other key geographic\nfeature of the continent (see Figure 5.6). The Amazon River is South America\u2019s longest river and\nis the largest river in the world in terms of discharge. The river discharges 209,000 cubic meters\n(7.4 million cubic feet) every second \u2013 more than the discharge of the next seven largest rivers\ncombined!Itsdrainagebasincoversanareaofover7millionsquarekilometers(2.7millionsquare\nmiles). 90 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 5.6: Amazon River and Drainage Basin (\u00a9Kmusser, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nNumerous rivers snake across Central America, but the most prominent water feature is Lake\nNicaragua. This large, freshwater lake is home to numerous species of fish and provides both\neconomic and recreational benefits to the people of Nicaragua. Plans were approved to build a\ncanal through Nicaragua to connect the Caribbean Sea to Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean\nthough many worry about the ecological impacts of such a large-scale project.\nCurrently, theonlyconnectionbetweentheCaribbean SeaandthePacificOceanisthroughthe\nPanama Canal. The canal was started in 1881 by the French, in what was then territory owned\nby Colombia, but the project was a failure. French construction workers were unprepared for the\ntorrentialCentralAmericanrainyseason,densejungle,anddifficultgeology.22,000workerswere\nkilled due to disease and accidents.\nThe United States helped Panama achieve independence from Colombia and in exchange,\nPanama granted the US rights to build and control the canal. In 1904, the US continued where MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 91\nthe French had left off and in just ten years, the project was completed. Over 5,600 workers died\nduring the US construction project. Panama regained control of the canal in 1999.\nWhen the canal was completed, it accommodated around 1,000 ships per year. Today, around\n15,000 ships pass through the canal each year. One key issue is that the Panama Canal\u2019s\nwaterways are almost entirely man-made and pass through areas of changing elevation. A series\nof locks take ships from lower-elevation waterways and raise or lower them depending on the\ndirection the ships are headed. It takes around 8 to 10 hours for a ship to pass through. These\nlocks were not built with modern ships in mind, however, and construction was undertaken to\nwiden the locks to accommodate today\u2019s massive container ships. The expansion project was\ncompleted in 2016.\n5.2 COLONIZATION AND CONQUEST IN MIDDLE AMERICA\nMiddle America was settled by a number of indigenous groups who originally migrated to the\nregionfromNorthAmerica.SomecontinuedonthroughtheIsthmusofPanamatoSouthAmerica.\nHere, they founded the Mesoamerican cultural hearth, considered one of the earliest civilizations\nin the world. Two groups in the region had a particularly strong impact on the cultural landscape\nof Middle America: the Maya and the Aztec.\nThe Maya Civilization began around 2000 BCE and stretched across present-day Honduras,\nGuatemala,Belize,andtheYucatanpeninsula.Thecivilizationhadatheocraticstructure,withtheir\nkingviewedasadivineruler.Theydevelopedasystemofhieroglyphicscript,acalendar,asystem\nof mathematics, and astronomy. The civilization had a number of city-states linked by a complex\ntrading system.They alsohadmonumental architecture, andanumber oftheir buildings, like the\npyramidal Chichen Itza, are still visible on the landscape today (see Figure 5.7). At its height, the\nMaya Empire encompassed over one million people. 92 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 5.7: El Castillo at Chichen Itza (\u00a9 Daniel Schwen, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nSo what happened to the Maya? The short answer is: we\u2019re not really sure. It takes a carefully\nmanaged infrastructure to care for one million people. Some researchers think the civilization\nsimplygottoobigtoofastandanynumberofcalamities,perhapsecologicaldamageoradisease\nepidemic,relatedtothisrapidpopulationgrowthcouldhavehadadevastatingeffect.Othersthink\nthatinfightingbrokeoutwithinthesociety.Stillothersmaintainthathistoricalclimatedatashows\na decrease in rainfall in the region around the time of the Maya\u2019s decline, perhaps indicating a\nwidespread famine. In any case, in such a large society, it would only take a small problem to\nsendthesystemintoturmoilandbythe9thcenturyCE,theMayahadabandoneditscitiesandits\nempire collapsed.\nThe Aztec Empire developed much later in history, during the 15th century CE (see Figure\n5.8). This civilization was centered around Tenochtitlan which became its capital and one of the\ngreatest cities in the Americas, with a population between 100,000 and 200,000 people. Today,\nthe ruins of Tenochtitlan are located under present-day Mexico City. Aztec architecture, art, and\ntrading systems were truly extraordinary for their time. MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 93\nFigure 5.8: Map of the Aztec Empire, 1519 (\u00a9 Badseed, historicair, and Madman2001; Wikimedia Commons, CC\nBY-SA 3.0)\nThis empire was relatively short-lived, however, and the reason for its decline is much easier to\npinpoint than the Maya. The Spanish, led by the conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, aligned themselves\nwith a rival group and arrived in Tenochtitlan, as very unwelcome visitors, in 1520. Violence\nerupted and the Aztec leader Montezuma was killed, marking the beginning of the end of the\ncivilization. By 1521, the Spanish and their allies had destroyed the city of Tenochtitlan and the\nAztecs were subsequently ruled by a series of leaders who were chosen by the Spanish.\nColonization completely reshaped the Middle American landscape, from architecture to politics\nto land-holding patterns. Middle America can be divided into two different spheres, the mainland\nandtherimland,eachwithadistinctcolonialhistoryandexperience(seeFigure5.9).Therimland,\nthough a fragmented realm of islands, was more accessible for European colonists than the\nmainland and were among the first places explorers landed when they reached the Americas.\nChristopher Columbus first reached the rimland in 1492 CE and would reach South America\non a third voyage in 1498 CE. The first Spanish cities in the Americas were established in the\nregionduringthistimeperiod.Bythe1600s,England,Portugal,France,andtheNetherlandswere\nshipping Africans to the Americas to work on farms. Of the more than 11 million Africans who 94 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nwere sold as slaves and shipped overseas, over 90 percent were sent to the Caribbean and South\nAmerica.\nFigure 5.9: Map of the Middle American Mainland and Rimland (Derivative work from original by\nLokal_Profil, Wikimedia Commons)\nThe rimland\u2019s sprawling plantations where the slaves worked were focused on growing crops,\nmostoftensugar,forexport.Priortothecommercialagriculturepracticedonplantations,mostin\nthe region practiced subsistence farming, where farmers grow enough food to feed themselves\nand their families. Since subsistence farmers eat what they grow, they typically grow a variety\nof crops. You can only eat so much corn before you need a bit more variety. Plantation farms,\nhowever, were generally monocultures, meaning only a single crop was grown. This, combined\nwith the free slave labor, allowed for maximum efficiency and profit. Labor was seasonal,\ncoincidingwiththeseasonalityofthecultivatedcrop.Today,therimlandisstillhometoanumber\nof plantations and the blending of European and African cultures is prominent on the landscape.\nIn the mainland, there is a blending of both indigenous and Spanish cultures. There is an\nethnic blending as well. Mestizo refers to someone of mixed European and Amerindian, or\nindigenous American, descent and a number of Middle and South American countries have a\nsizable mestizo population. The Spanish conquest of mainland Middle America not only toppled\nthe Aztec civilization but also led to the deaths of millions of indigenous people due to war and\ndisease.\nIn contrast with the plantations of the rimland, the mainland was more commonly home to\nhaciendas, Spanish estates where a variety of crops were grown both for local and international\nmarkets. Because of this variety, workers lived on the land, unlike the seasonal laborers needed\nto work plantations. Furthermore, although haciendas were less efficient than plantations, they\nwere also less vulnerable economically. If you\u2019re only growing one crop and the price of that crop MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 95\ndeclines, you have no backup. Similarly, disease or a bad harvest could dramatically decrease\nprofits. The increased diversity in crops grown on a hacienda decreased risk. Haciendas also\nhad an element of social prestige. The size of the hacienda increased the social standing of the\nlandowner, and hacienda farmers were often given their own plots of land to cultivate.\nBroadly, the colonization of Middle America led to land alienation, where land is taken from\none group and claimed by another. Where indigenous groups might have previously controlled\ntheir own subsistence farms, wealthy European settlers took over the land and built haciendas \u2013\noftenthenemployingthosewhoselandtheyclaimed.Today,povertycontinuestobeasignificant\nissue among the indigenous people of Middle and South America and the current system of land\nownership found in the region directly connects to European colonization.\n5.3 THE SOUTH AMERICAN COLONIAL LANDSCAPE\nA variety of ancient cultures were found in South America prior to colonization. These indigenous\ngroups settled in a variety of environments, some in the coastal plains and others in the Amazon\nbasin.Onegroup,theInca,primarilysettledinthealtiplanoofPerubeginninginthe13thcentury.\nThe Inca Empire was the largest of the pre-Colombian, referring to before Columbus\u2019 arrival,\ncivilizations. Initially, the Inca founded the city-state Kingdom of Cusco, but over time, expanded\nto encompass four territories stretching 2,500 miles and included over 4 million people.\nIn 1494 CE, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing up territory in the New\nWorld between the two colonial empires (see Figure 5.10). The Spanish would control territory\nto the west of the line while Portugal would control territory to the east. Spanish conquistador\nFrancisco Pizarro reached the Inca by 1526 CE. The empire, already weakened by smallpox and\ninfighting, was conquered by the Spanish soon after. Portugal meanwhile conquered much of\neastern South America in present-day Brazil. 96 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 5.10: Map of the Lines Demarcated by the Treaty of Tordesillas (\u00a9 Lencer, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n3.0)\nIncoastalSouthAmerica,France,theNetherlands,andtheUnitedKingdomestablishedcolonies\n(see Figure 5.11). These colonial possessions were largely extensions of the Central American\nrimlandwithlargeplantationsandslavelabor.Portugal,too,establishedplantationsalongcoastal\nBrazil. As colonialism expanded, the colonial empires prospered. Lima, for example, in present-\nday Peru, became one of the wealthiest cities in the word due to its silver deposits. MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 97\nFigure 5.11: Colonies of South America,\n1796 (Derivative work from original by\nEsemono, Wikimedia Commons)\nColonization dramatically changed the urban landscape of the Americas as well as rural\ndevelopment patterns. Development broadly refers to economic, social, and institutional\nadvancements and levels of development vary widely across the region. In the rural areas of\nSouth America, land was taken from indigenous groups, as it had been in Middle America, and\ntransformed to the benefit of colonial interests. The main interest of the conquering group was\ntoextractricheswithlittlethoughtgiventofosteringlocaldevelopmentandregionalconnectivity.\nEven today, many of the rural areas of South America remain highly isolated and the indigenous\ndescendants of conquered Amerindian groups among the poorest in the region.\nIn cities that were conquered, European colonizers typically razed existing structures and built\nnew ones. In general, there was little regard for local development and cultural values. The\nSpanish colonies, for example, were governed according to the Laws of the Indies. These laws\nregulated social, economic, and political life in territories that were controlled by Spain. They also\nprescribed a very specific set of urban planning guidelines, including building towns around a\nPlazaMayor(mainsquare)andcreatingaroadnetworkonagridsystem.Eventoday,thecitiesof\nthe Americas often look quite European. In Mexico City, for example, the Spanish destroyed the\nAzteccapitalofTenochtitlanandbuilttheMexicoCityCathedralovertheruinsoftheAztecTemplo\nMayor complex (seeFigure 5.12). 98 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 5.12: Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico (\u00a9 Jeff Kramer, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nIn the early 19th century, most of the colonies of Middle and South America gained their\nindependence, often led by the Europeans who had settled in the region. Larger colonial\npossessions often separated into smaller independent states. For a short time, the states of\nCentral America formed a federal republic, but this experiment devolved into civil war. Today,\nmost of the mainland of Middle and South America is independent, with the exception of French\nGuiana which is maintained as a French territory and is home to a launch site for the European\nSpaceAgency.Manyoftheislandnationsarestillcontrolledbyothercountries.France,theUnited\nStates, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands all still have territories in the Caribbean.\n5.4 URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AMERICA\nSouth America is a highly urbanized region, with over 80 percent of people living in cities. Central\nAmerica and the Caribbean are slightly less urbanized at around 70 percent. Development and\nhuman settlement are not spread evenly across the region, however. Several countries in Middle\nand South America have a primate city. Primate cities are those which are the largest city in\na country, are more than twice as large as the next largest city, and are representative of the MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 99\nnational culture. For example, of Uruguay\u2019s 3.4 million people, over half live in its capital and\nprimate city of Montevideo. Not all countries of the world have a primate city. Germany\u2019s largest\ncity is Berlin, which is roughly twice as large as Hamburg and Munich and was once the country\u2019s\nprimatecity.Inrecentyears,however,MunichhasincreasinglybecomeGermany\u2019sculturalcenter.\nThe region is also home to several megacities. A megacity is a metropolitan area with over 10\nmillion people. Mexico City, the capital and primate city of Mexico, has a population of 22 million\npeople. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil has 21.5 million. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina are\nalso megacities. Megacities often face distinct challenges. With over 10 million people comes a\nsignificantneedforaffordablehousingandemployment.Megacitiesoftenhavelargepopulations\nofhomelesspeopleand,particularlyinMiddleandSouthAmerica,sprawlingslums.Thisimmense\npopulation also needs a carefully managed infrastructure, everything from sanitation to\ntransportation,andthedevelopingcountriesofthisregionhavehistoricallyhaddifficultymeeting\nthe demand.\nDespite the challenges faced by large urban populations, rural to urban migration continues\nin the region. As in many parts of the world, poor rural farmers migrated to the cities where\nindustrial development was clustered in search of work.\nIngeneral,thecitiesofMiddleandSouthAmericafollowasimilarmodelofurbandevelopment\n(see Figure 5.13). The central business district, or CBD, is located in the center of the city often\nalongside a central market. While some colonial buildings were demolished following\nindependence, cities in this region still typically have a large plaza area in the CBD. As\nindustrialization occurred, additional industrial and commercial development extended along the\nspine,whichmightbeamajorboulevard.Thespineisoftenconnectedtomajorretailareaormall. 100 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 5.13: Model of the Latin American City (Figure by author, based on Ford 1996)\nSurroundingthecommercialareaofthespineistheeliteresidentialsectorconsistingofhousing\nfor the wealthiest residents of the city often in high-rise condominiums. Around the CBD is the\nzone of maturity, an area of middle class housing. The zone of in situ accretion is a transitional\narea from the modest middle class housing of the zone of maturity to the slums of the city\u2019s\npoorest residents.\nThe outermost ring in a typical Latin American city is the zone of peripheral squatter\nsettlements.Inthiszone,residentsdonotownorpayrentandinsteadoccupyotherwiseunused\nland, known as \u201csquatting.\u201d In some cases, residents in this zone earn money by participating\nin the informal sector where goods and services are bought and sold without being taxed or\nmonitored by the government. Disamenity sectors arise along highways, rail lines, or other small\ntracts of unoccupied land where the city\u2019s poor often live out in the open. Residents often build MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 101\nhousing out of whatever materials they can find such as cardboard or tin. What is perhaps most\nstriking about the Latin American city is that in some areas, the city\u2019s poorest residents live in an\narea adjacent to the wealthiest residents magnifying the income inequality that is present in the\nregion.\nGlobally, around one-third of people in developing countries live in slums, characterized by\nlocationswithsubstandardhousingandinfrastructure.Estimatesvaryregardingthetotalnumber\nof people who live in slums but it is likely just below 1 billion people and continues to climb. In\nBrazil,thesesprawlingslumsareknownasfavelasandover11millionpeopleinthiscountryalone\nlive in favelas. Rocinha, located in Rio de Janeiro, is Brazil\u2019s largest favela and is home to almost\n70,000 people (see Figure 5.14). It has transitioned from a squatter area with temporary housing\nto more permanent structures with basic sanitation, electricity, and plumbing.\nFigure 5.14: Rocinha Favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (\u00a9 Chensiyuan, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nIn some cases, those who live in the slums of Middle and South America are not unemployed\nbut simply cannot find affordable housing in the cities. Rural to urban migration here, as in other\nparts of the world, has outpaced housing construction. Even some lower and middle managers\nare unable to find housing and thus end up living in the slums. 102 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n5.5 INCOME INEQUALITY IN MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA\nAlthough income inequality in Middle and South America has fallen in recent years, this region\nremains by some measures the most unequal region in the world. Overall, the top 10 percent\nof people in Latin America control around 71 percent of the region\u2019s wealth. If current trends\ncontinue, the top 1 percent will have amassed more wealth than the bottom 99 percent. In\nMexico,aroundhalfofthepopulationlivesinpovertyandwhiletherichinMexicohaveseentheir\nwealthclimbdramaticallyinrecentyears,povertyratesremainrelativelyunchanged.InBrazil,the\nwealthiest10percentofthepopulationownalmostthree-quartersofthecountry\u2019swealth,around\nthe same as in the United States. This inequality has been a product of geography but has also\nimpacted the landscape, as well.\nFarmersinMiddle andSouthAmericahavestruggled withlandownership aftertheiralienation\nfrom the land during colonization. While countries like Spain and Portugal no longer control\nland in Middle and South America, many of these countries\u2019 governments took over colonial\nlandholdingsduringindependenceratherthanturningitbackovertoprivatefarmers.Often,small\nfarmersintheregionsimplycan\u2019tcompetewiththelarge-scale agricultural producers.Thiseither\nworsens rural poverty or contributes to rural to urban migration as farmers leave to find work\nelsewhere.\nGovernment responses to income inequality vary. Some countries of Latin America and the\nCaribbean turned to socialism in the hope that government-controlled development would be\nable to more fairly distribute wealth. Often these socialist endeavors were financed with the\nexports of natural resources, such as oil or coffee, but this created a vulnerable dependency on\nforeign trade. In Venezuela, for example, where Hugo Chavez ushered in a socialist revolution\nat the turn of the 21st century, falling oil prices in 2016 threw the economy into steep decline\nleading to massive inflation and a shortage of domestic products (see Figure 5.15). Governments\nlike Venezuela often relied too heavily on income from exports and invested little in developing\ntheir own infrastructure, instead simply relying on importing the goods they needed. In general,\nspending on social services remains relatively low across the region. MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 103\nFigure 5.15: Venezuela\u2019s Inflation Rate Compared to Annual Oil Revenues, 1980-2015 (\u00a9 ZiaLater, Wikimedia\nCommons, CC BY 1.0)\nTaxationsystemshavehadarelativelyminimaleffectonbetteringthelivesoftheregion\u2019spoor\nor assisting the region in infrastructure development.

Many governments have also given tax breaks to large,\nmultinationalcorporationswhoseektodobusinessintheregionprovidingashort-termeconomic\nincrease at the expense of long-term development planning.\nInequality is not just an issue of poverty, however. It can also relate to unequal access to\neducation and political power. 62 percent of the population of Bolivia is indigenous, for example,\nbut the country did not have a president from indigenous descent until Evo Morales was elected\nin 1998. Among the indigenous population of Bolivia, most work in agriculture and around 42\npercent of indigenous students do not finish school compared to just 17 percent of non-\nindigenous students. There is a distinct cycle between education and poverty with educational\nadvancement directly linked to economic advancement. In some areas, access to adequate\neducation, particularly among indigenous populations, remains low, limiting the opportunity to\nnarrow the income gap.\nFor some, liberation theology has provided a sense of hope. Liberation theology is a form of\nChristianity that is blended with political activism. There is a strong emphasis on social justice,\npoverty, and human rights. This approach also stresses the importance of alleviating poverty 104 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nthrough action and followers believe that, like Jesus, they should align themselves with society\u2019s\nmarginalized groups.\nOthersintheregionhavedecidedtolookelsewhereforeconomicadvancement.Mostcountries\nin Middle and South America have net out-migration, meaning more people are leaving than\ncoming into the country. Around 15 percent of all international migrants are from Latin America\nand the United States continues to be top destination. Some from Central America, however, are\nchoosing to stay in Mexico rather than continue the journey north to the United States.\n5.6 PATTERNS OF GLOBALIZATION IN MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA\nTheongoingmigrationfromMiddleandSouthAmericapointstoalargerissueofglobaleconomic\nconnectivity. Many of the region\u2019s migrants are well-educated and leave in search of better\neconomic opportunities. This contributes to brain drain, referring to the emigration of highly\nskilled workers \u201cdraining\u201d their home country of their knowledge and skills. Around 84 percent of\nHaiti\u2019s college graduates live outside of their home country, for example, the greatest percentage\nof any country in the world.\nWhenworkersleavetheregioninsearchofworkelsewhere,theyoftensendhomeremittances,\nortransfersofmoneybacktotheirhomecountry.In2014,globalremittancestotaled$583billion,\nand in some countries, remittances represent a significant portion of the country\u2019s GDP, in some\ncasesexceedingtheamountthecountryearnsfromitslargestexport.Mexico\u2019sremittancesalone\ntotaled over $25 billion in 2015, or around 2 percent of its total GDP. Most remittances in Middle\nand South America originate in the United States.\nAs countries in this region have sought to increase development, they have faced several\nchallenges. Exports continue to flow from Latin America and the Caribbean to the rest of the\nworld, though often coming at the cost of economic diversification. The island nations of the\nCaribbean have had particular challenges to sustainable development due to their small size\nand populations and limited natural resource base. These countries are referred to as Small\nIsland Developing States, or SIDS (see Figure 5.16). These countries have struggled with high\ntechnology, communication, energy, and transportation costs and have had difficulty developing\nin a way that doesn\u2019t harm their fragile ecosystems. In the Caribbean, the SIDS have formed the\nCaribbean Community, or CARICOM, aimed at promoting economic integration and cooperation\namong its member countries. MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 105\nFigure 5.16: Map of the Small Island Developing States of Middle and South America (Derivative work from original\nby Osiris, Wikimedia Commons)\nSome countries, particularly those in the Caribbean, have advanced their economies through\noffshore banking.

The Cayman Islands, though, is one of the world\u2019s leading\noffshore banking locations. Around $1.5 trillion in wealth is held in the Cayman Islands and the\nBritish territory has branches for 40 of the 50 largest banks in the world. As a result, it has a GDP\nper capita of over $49,000 compared to just $8,800 for its much larger neighbor, Jamaica.

Similarly, as\nagricultural lands expand and commercialize to feed growing populations and produce crops for\nexport, it often leads to deforestation. Furthermore, nutrients in soil decline over time without\ncareful land management, and thus after lands are intensively farmed for some time, soil fertility\ndeclines and new agricultural lands are cleared. Around 75 percent of Nicaragua\u2019s forests have\nbeen cut down and converted to pasture land. The Amazon rainforest, which amazingly holds\naround 10 percent of the entire world\u2019s known biodiversity, is down to around 80 percent of its\nsize in 1970. The majority of the deforestation in the Amazon has occurred as a result of the\ngrowth of Brazil\u2019s cattle industry and its global export of beef and leather.\nDespite slowing rates of deforestation and strides to address income inequality, this region\nremains largely in the global periphery. Some argue that it is to the advantage of countries like\ntheUnitedStatestokeepthisregionintheperiphery,asitallowsthemtoimportcheapproducts.\nThis idea is known as dependency theory, and it essentially states that resources flow from\nthe periphery to the core, and thus globalization and inequality are linked in the current world\nsystem. While some have critiqued the specifics of the theory, others still see it as a useful way to\nunderstand the relationship between the core and the periphery.

Our early ancestors, homo erectus, meaning \u201cupright\nman,\u201d first walked in East Africa between one and two million years ago. Early humans in Africa\nwere the first to create tools, develop language, and control fire. The physical landscape of Africa\nanditslonghistoryofhabitationhavecontributedtoavarietyofculturesandhumanexperiences.\nAfricaisthesecond-largestcontinentafterAsiaandistheonlycontinentthatiscrossedbyboth\ntheTropicofCancer,located23degreesnorthoftheEquator,andtheTropicofCapricorn,located\n23 degrees south of the Equator (see Figure 6.1). These tropics are areas of high atmospheric\npressure creating dry conditions. The Sahara lies along the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the\nNamib Desert is situated on the Tropic of Capricorn in the south. The Sahara stretches across\nmuch of northern Africa creating a formidable barrier and dividing Africa between a Muslim,\nArab North and traditional African cultural groups in the south. Since North Africa is so similar\nto Southwest Asia in terms of culture and political history, the two are discussed together in a\nseparate chapter.\n107 108 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 6.1: Sub-Saharan African Physical Geography and Political Boundaries (CIA World Factbook, Public Domain)\nThe story of Africa\u2019s physical geography begins 300 million years ago with the landmass known\nasPangaea,thelastsupercontinent(seeFigure6.2).Around175millionyearsago,Pangaeabegan\nto break apart, drifting and colliding and forming the continents as we know them today. Africa\nwas situated at the heart of this supercontinent. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 109\nFigure 6.2: Break Up of Pangaea (United States Geological Survey, Public Domain)\nToday, many of the physical landforms found in Africa were formed from this tectonic plate\nmovement. Africa\u2019s Great Rift Valley, for example, is slowly splitting away from the rest of the\nAfrican Plate at a rate of around 6 to 7 mm (around 0.25 in) each year (see Figure 6.3). That\nmight not sound like a lot, but after 100 years, the rift would have expanded by two feet! Some 110 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nof the deepest lakes in the world are found along this rift valley, where huge cracks in the earth\u2019s\nsurface have filled with water over time. Lake Tanganyika, for example, is the second-largest and\nsecond-deepest freshwater lake in the world, dipping down to 1,470 m (4,820 ft).

This basin begins\nin the highlands of the rift valley and is the drainage area for the Congo River, Africa\u2019s largest\nriver by discharge and the deepest river in the world. This watershed is considered a biodiversity\nhotspotanditsforestssupportaround40millionpeople.However,thereisseriousconcerninthe\nregion regarding deforestation.\nAfrica\u2019s other major river, the Nile, flows from Lake Victoria in the rift valley north through 11\ndifferentcountries.Itisregardedbymostasthelongestriverintheworld.TheNilehas,historically\nand in modern times, been a key way to transport people and goods throughout the region and\nits floodplain enables farming in an otherwise arid environment.\nPerhaps the largest ecoregion of Sub-Saharan Africa is the Sahel, located just south of the\nSahara(seeFigure6.4).TheSahelisatransitionalregionconnectingthedrySaharatothetropical\nregionsofthesouth.Itismostlygrasslandandhastraditionallysupportedsemi-nomadiclivestock\nherders. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 111\nFigure 6.4: Map of the Sahel Region of Africa (\u00a9 Munion, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThe Sahel is at the front line of one of the most pressing environmental concerns in Africa:\ndesertification (see Figure 6.5). Desertification refers to the process of previously fertile land\nbecoming desert and occurs for a variety of reasons including climate change and human\nactivities.Overgrazing,forexample,canridlandofvegetationcausingtheerosionoffertiletopsoil.\nWarming temperatures due to global changes in climate can change precipitation patterns and\nincrease the speed of evaporation. Desertification in the Sahel has caused the Sahara to expand\nand has led to conflict as northern farmers have migrated to the south in search of fertile soil. 112 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 6.5: Map of Desertification Risk in Africa (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural\nResources Conservation Service, Public Domain)\nInadditiontoanarrayoflandformsfromriftvalleystomountainstodeserts,Sub-SaharanAfrica\ncontains a wide variety of climate zones and precipitation patterns.

Early humans were primarily gatherers, and there is evidence of people gathering nuts,\ngrasses,andtubersaround16,000BCEinthehighlandsofNorthernEthiopia.Around10,000years SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 113\nago, the domestication of the first crops and livestock developed in Africa and the practice of\nsettled agriculture began.\nIn pre-colonial Africa, women were, and still are in many areas, the primary agriculturalists. It\nwas the responsibility of women to understand the seasonality of crops and this, along with the\nroleofbearingandrearingchildren,gavewomenanimportantroleinAfricansociety.Manyearly\nreligions placed a strong emphasis on female goddesses reflecting the central role of women in\nsociety.

Furthermore, land could not be bought or\nsold, but instead was passed down through the tradition of partible inheritance, meaning land\nis divided among the heirs.

With partible\ninheritance,however,nolandedaristocracydevelopedsinceeverymalewasgivenanequalshare\nrather than just the firstborn.\nIf the family was the basic social unit in African society, it was the extended family that was the\nmost important politically. Tribes, consisting of groups of families united by a common ancestry\nand language, controlled distinct tracts of territory. In pre-colonial Africa, there were over 800\ndistinctethnicregions\u2013andsomeoftheethnicregionsidentifiedbyanthropologistsactuallyhad\nmultiple distinct cultural groups within them. Tribal groups sometimes coexisted peacefully, and\nother times, warred over territory.\nPre-colonialAfricawasalsothesiteofanumberoflargeempires(seeFigure6.6).TheKingdom\nof Kush, for example, was established in 1070 BCE and located on the Nile River just south of the\nEgyptian Empire. The Kingdom of Aksum located in present-day Eritrea and Ethiopia existed from\n100CEto940CEandwasoneofthemostpowerfulofthepre-colonialAfricanempires.Therulers\nof the kingdom minted their own currency, built religious monuments, and established trading\nroutes. The first state in West Africa was the Empire of Ghana, which lasted from around 350 CE\nuntilitsconquestbytheMaliEmpireinthe1200sCE.TheEmpireofGhanahadalargecapitalcity,\nmarkets, and a system of taxation. 114 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 6.6: Map of Pre-Colonial Kingdoms in Africa (\u00a9 Jeff Israel, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nTwo historical events brought significant change to Africa\u2019s cultural landscape and history. The\nfirst was the spread of the Islamic Empire across North Africa beginning in the 7th century CE.\nThe second was the start of the transatlantic slave trade in the 15th century CE. Slavery was\npresentinAfricalongbeforeEuropeanconquest,however.Insomepre-colonial Africansocieties,\nas in other parts of the world, slavery was a part of the local community. Slaves might be taken\nfromconqueredgroupsorgivenasgifts.Ingeneral,though,slaveryrepresentedarelativelysmall\nsegment of ancient African society and economy.\nEuropean contact with Africa was initially focused on establishing a port along the West African\ncoast, a place to resupply along the long trip to South and Southeast Asia. Beginning in the\n15th century, however, this objective shifted to gaining resources. Portugal was the first of the\nEuropeans to begin buying enslaved Africans. The Portuguese, originally interested in trading for SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 115\ngoldandspices,setupseveralsugarplantationsontheislandsofS\u00e3oTom\u00e9,offthewesterncoast\nof Equatorial Africa. Portugal then brought in slaves to help cultivate the sugar. The Spanish then\nbegan buying slaves to send to the New World in the early 16th century, bringing them first to\nthe islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. Initially, Europeans raided coastal African villages in order to\nsecure slaves, but over time, began purchasing slaves from African rulers and traders.\nSincepre-colonialAfricawasdividedintodistinctethnolinguisticregions,Africansgenerallysaw\nthemselves as part of their ethnic group or tribe rather than as united by a \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican\u201d\nidentity. Thus, the slaves sold by Africans were seen as \u201cother,\u201d something different or less than\nthemselves.Europeansdevelopedmilitaryalliancesandbeneficialtradingpartnershipswithsome\nofthesegroupstoensureasteadysupplyofslaves.By1700CE,around50,000slaveswerebeing\nshippedoutofAfricaeachyear,andthoughitisdifficulttoknowtheexacttotalnumberofpeople\nsold into slavery, it is estimated that around 12 million Africans were shipped to the New World.\nDuring this time, many African groups practiced a form of agriculture known as shifting\ncultivation, where one area of land is farmed for a period of time and then abandoned until its\nfertility naturally restores. Eventually, farmers return to the abandoned plot of land after many\nyears,whichisnowovergrown,andoftenburnthevegetation,knownasslash-and-burn, inorder\nto return the nutrients to the soil. Because of this, much of the land in Africa looked unused, but\nwas actually part of a larger agricultural system. Colonial empires took over these fragments of\nunused land to set up their own agricultural systems.\nFor some time, European empires had this relatively piecemeal approach to Africa, taking\nresources, land, and slaves without directly controlling territory. Europeans had little interest in\nthe interior of Africa and were primarily focused on the coastal areas. This would completely\nchange beginning in the late 19th century as European powers scrambled for control of the\ncontinent.\n6.3 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COLONIZATION\nAs the Industrial Revolution was spreading across Europe, colonial empires were seeking to\nexpand their colonial holdings in order to gain mineral resources and expand agricultural\nproduction. As Europeans began exploring the interior of Africa, and recognized its resource\npotential, competition among European empires grew fierce. France, Italy, Britain, Portugal, and\nBelgium all raced through the interior of Africa trying to expand and strengthen their territories.\nWhenGermanyenteredtherace,thecolonialempiresdecidedthatitwasinEurope\u2019sbestinterest\nto agree on and clearly demarcate African colonies and to agree on common policy.\nIn 1884, 13 European countries as well as the United States sent representatives to the Berlin\nConference. At this conference, the colonial powers established the procedure for a Western\ncountry to formally control African territory and ultimately re-shaped the map of Africa. In a\ncontinent that had previously been divided into territories held by tribal groups and some larger\nkingdoms, the political boundaries were completely changed. By the early 20th century, around\n90 percent of Africa was directly controlled by Europeans (seeFigure 6.7). 116 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 6.7: Map of Colonies in Africa, 1913 (Derivative work from original by Eric Gaba, Wikimedia Commons)\nEuropean colonization of Africa completely reshaped the political and ethnic landscape, with\nlasting effects even today. Colonialism broadly refers to the control of a territory by another\ngroupandcolonialpoliciesvariedacrossAfrica.IntheBelgianCongo,whatisnowtheDemocratic\nRepublic of the Congo, there was a racist ideology of paternalism where Africans were essentially\nviewed as children needing a fatherly, or paternal, authority to educate them in the ways of\nthe West. In the far-reaching French colonies, from present-day Madagascar to Morocco, the\ncolonizers emphasized an assimilationist policy, spreading the French culture through language,\nlaws, and education. In the British colonies, like present-day Uganda, Ghana, and Nigeria, settlers\npartnered with local rulers who were made representatives of the British crown. This was known\nasindirectrule.ThePortuguese,however,continuedtobeprimarilyinterestedinresourcesrather\nthan local politics or culture. Their policy of exploitation in places like Angola and Mozambique\nignored local development and the empire kept rigid control over local economies. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 117\nEuropean colonizers were generally focused on exporting goods, with little attention given to\nlocaldevelopmentorconnectivity.Theseeasilysoldrawmaterialsoragriculturalgoodsareknown\nascommodities.Localcommunitieswhichmayhavepreviouslypracticedsubsistenceagriculture\nwere shifted to export-oriented crops destined for European markets. When rail lines were built\ninAfrica,theyweregenerallyconstructedtosimplytakeresourcesfromtheinteriortothecoastal\nports without concern for developing regional linkages.\nEventually, the African colonies gained their independence, though the ease with which they\nwere granted independence and the ease of their transition varied widely. Because the British\npracticed indirect rule, their colonies generally had a gradual transition of power with local rulers\nwho\u2019dbeenmaderepresentativesofBritainnowgoverningoverindependentterritories.Belgium,\nhowever, initially opposed the independence movement in its colonies, which were ruled directly\nby Belgian leaders. Most African countries would gain their independence following World War II.\nThe last European colony to be granted independence was Djibouti in 1977.\nWhile independence movements successfully broke territories free from European control,\nmanyareaswerefacedwithadifficultdecisionregardinghowtopoliticallyorganizeasastate.The\nEuropean powers had redrawn the map of Africa with no regard for underlying ethnic territories.\nSome ethnic groups were thus grouped together, sharing colonial territory with groups they had\nlong-standing conflicts with. Other ethnic groups were split apart, divided between two or more\ncolonies. As the new political map of Africa took shape, it generally followed many of the colonial\nboundaries that had been artificially created.\nWheretwoormoreethnicgroupssharedanewlyindependentterritory,howshouldtheydecide\nwho should rule? Perhaps the groups could simply share power and live peacefully. But what if\none group, because of imposed colonial boundaries, no longer had access to resources? What if\nanother group wanted to have unilateral control and not share it with groups they perceived as\n\u201cother\u201d?ManyofthepoliticalandeconomicchallengesfacingthecountriesincontemporaryAfrica\nare rooted in its colonial history.\n6.4 THE MODERN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN LANDSCAPE\nToday, Sub-Saharan Africa is comprised of 48 independent countries and is home to 800 million\npeople. While colonialism transformed African politics and economics, the way of life for many\nAfricanshaschangedrelativelylittle.Onlyaroundone-thirdofpeopleinSub-SaharanAfricanslive\nin cities, and as of 2007, 72 percent of these city-dwellers lived in slums. Sub-Saharan Africa is\nstill largely rural. Urbanization is increasing, however, asgovernments have invested in industries\nin an effort to strengthen economic development drawing impoverished farmers from rural\ncommunities. Relatively few Sub-Saharan Africans live in large cities; most live in urban areas\nwith fewer than 200,000 people. A notable exception to this is Nigeria, which was 48 percent\nurbanized in 2015 and contains several cities with over one million residents including its former\ncapitalLagos(seeFigure6.8).ThemetropolitanareaofLagoshasapopulationestimatedtobe21\nmillion; it is the most populous city in Africa. 118 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 6.8: Lagos, Nigeria (\u00a9 Benji Robertson, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 1.0)\nSub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population has been climbing rapidly with the highest fertility rates of any\nregion in the world. In Angola, for example, on the southwest African coast, most women have\naround six children. This has created a very high dependency ratio across the region, referring to\ntheratioofpeoplenotinthelaborforcetothenumberofproductiveworkers.Africa\u2019spopulation\nis expected to double between 2010 and 2050. Nigeria, with 2017 population of over 190 million,\nis projected to surpass the population of the United States by 2050 to become the third-most\npopulous country in the world.\nIn addition to rapid population growth, another significant challenge facing the governments\nof Sub-Saharan Africa is related to healthcare. Across the region, imbalances exist between the\navailabilityandqualityofcare.Furthermore,Sub-SaharanAfrica\u2019stropicalclimatehascontributed\nto the spread of a number of serious illnesses, and this fact, combined with often ineffective or\nunder-funded post-colonial governments have made stopping the spread of disease difficult.

The flu in the United States is an example of\nan epidemic disease, with increasing numbers of people affected during the winter months.\nMalaria, a disease spread by mosquitos, is the deadliest disease in Sub-Saharan Africa and\nsudden epidemics can affect large populations. If left without proper treatment, the disease can\nalso reemerge months later. 90 percent of all deaths from malaria worldwide occur in Africa and\nit is estimated that the disease costs $12 billion each year due to increased healthcare cost, lost SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 119\neconomic productivity, and a negative impact on tourism. Other insect-borne diseases that have\na significant clustering in Africa include Yellow fever, which is also spread by mosquitoes, and\ntrypanosomiasis, betterknown assleeping sickness, which istransmitted bythebiteofthetsetse\nfly.\nWhen examining the geography of the global HIV\/AIDS epidemic, Sub-Saharan Africa clearly\nstands out (see Figure 6.9). Around 70 percent of all people living with HIV\/AIDS live in Sub-\nSaharan Africa and while a diagnosis with the disease might be met with long-term treatments in\nother regions, its fatality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is much higher. In the hardest-hit countries,\nlike Swaziland, Botswana, and Lesotho, more than one in five adults are infected. The disease is\nmost often spread here by unsafe sexual practices, such as having sex unprotected with multiple\npartners even after marriage. Older adults in Africa are also deeply affected by HIV\/AIDS, as they\nare often left to care for grandchildren orphaned by the disease. HIV\/AIDS remains the leading\ncause of death in Africa.\nFigure 6.9: Map of the Share of the Population Infected with HIV by Country, 2017 (\u00a9Our World in Data, CC BY)\nStill, there have been strides to try to slow the spread and assist those with the disease.\nCountries like Uganda have supported public awareness campaigns promoting monogamy in\nmarriage and contraceptive use. They were able to slow the prevalence of HIV infections from 15\npercent in the early 1990s to just 5 percent in 2001. In recent years, however, the infection rate\nin Uganda has once again climbed. Some say the government squandered aid money from the 120 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\ninternational community and did not keep up the public health initiative once rates decreased\nultimately causing the infection rates to rise. There is also a concern that religious initiatives\npromoting abstinence have not had the desired effect. In a 2011 survey, around one-quarter of\nmarried men in Uganda reported having multiple sexual partners in the past year and just eight\npercent of them reported using a condom.\nPeriodically, regions in Africa, particularly West Africa, have experienced epidemics of Ebola, a\nviral hemorrhagic fever. Although Ebola is relatively difficult to transmit from person-to-person \u2013\nit cannot be spread through the air like the flu \u2013 a combination of lack of understanding about\ndiseasetransmission,inadequateinfrastructure,andadistrustofWesterninterventionhasmade\nthe region particularly vulnerable to deadly outbreaks. An outbreak beginning in 2013 in the\ncoastal West African country of Guinea spread across the surrounding area and killed 11,000\npeople over the course of two years (seeFigure 6.10).\nFigure 6.10: Map of the West African Ebola Outbreak, 2013-2016 (\u00a9 Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m, Wikimedia Commons, CC0\n1.0)\nThe political issues and difficulties of dealing with Africa\u2019s healthcare crises illustrate larger\nissues related to governance in the region. Corruption is a significant problem across Africa\ncosting residents around $150 billion each year. Bribery, even to access some public services, is\ncommon in many areas. Several governments deteriorated to the point where they are no longer\nfunctional,whichisreferredtoasafailedstate.Infact,ofthetenstatesmostvulnerabletofailure\nin the world, seven are located in Africa.\nIn some areas, political conflict has gone hand-in-hand with ethnic conflict.

Hundreds of thousands of Tutsi fled, becoming refugees, people who have\nbeen forced to leave their country. By the early 1990s, the Hutu began preparing for genocide,\nseeking to eliminate the Tutsi minority. Over the course of 100 days between April and July 1994,\n800,000 Tutsis were killed \u2013 around 50 percent of the entire Tutsi population. By the time the\nUnited Nations admitted that \u201cacts of genocide may have been committed,\u201d 500,000 had already\nbeen killed, most murdered with machetes.

Conflict between Tutsi and Hutu,\nparticularly in neighboring Burundi, has continued, however.\nIn South Africa, the ruling party that came to power after independence was dominated not\nby an indigenous African group but by the descendants of Dutch settlers, known as Afrikaners.\nAfricansinSouthAfricaoutnumberednon-Africansby4to1andtherulingAfrikanersinstituteda\npolicyofracialseparationknownasapartheidaimedatmaintainingminorityrule.Thissystemof\nsegregation led to an entirely different system of education for non-white South Africans, limited\ntheiruseofpublicspaces,andforcedtherelocationofmillionsintoseparateneighborhoods.The\nsystem ended in 1994 with the country\u2019s first democratic elections, but inequality between white\nand non-white Africans persists, and has actually worsened according to some measures.\nSome countries have tried to overcome political instability and the lack of colonial connectivity\nby creating interregional organizations aimed at economic and political cooperation. The largest\nof these organizations is the African Union, which formed in 2001 and consists of every African\nstate, including Morocco which recently rejoined the AU in 2017.

In other cases, the language is native\nthe region, such as with Swahili, the lingua franca for much of Southeast Africa.\n6.5 ECONOMICS AND GLOBALIZATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\nAlthough formal colonization of Africa ended by 1980, in many areas, it was replaced with\nneocolonialism, the practice of exerting economic rather than direct political control over\nterritory. During the colonial era, European groups formally controlled Africa\u2019s resources and\ncreated export-oriented economies. Today, most of Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s exports remain raw\nmaterials. This makes the economies of countries in the region vulnerable to price fluctuations\nand global markets. Furthermore, although Western countries no longer directly control African 122 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nland,corporationsbasedinthesecountrieshaveeitherboughtlanddirectlyorinvestedheavilyin\nthe region. Investors have also purchased the water rights to some areas.\nNeocolonialism is also evidenced on a broader scale. The peripheral regions of the world\ngenerally supply goods and labor used by the core countries. Thus, the core continues to exert\neconomic pressure on the periphery to maintain beneficial trade partnerships and cheap\nproducts, labor, and raw materials. In many countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, a dual\neconomy exists, where plantations or commercial agriculture is practiced alongside traditional\nagriculturalmethods.SouthAfrica\u2019sdualeconomy,forexample,hascreateddramaticdifferences\nin development within its own borders and has exacerbated income inequality in the country.\nCritics of neocolonial theory argue that too much blame is placed on colonialism for the modern\neconomic problems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, government corruption, inefficiency, and\ninternal exploitation remains a significant barrier to long-term economic development.\nIn some cases, economic pressure has come from loans granted by the core to the periphery.\nAlthough the intention of these loans was to assist the periphery in infrastructure development,\nmany countries have struggled under the weight of staggering debt. Two lending organizations in\nparticular, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, have loaned over $150 billion\ntocountriesinAfrica.LoansbytheIMFandWorldBanktocountriesexperiencingeconomiccrises\nare accompanied by structural adjustment programs (SAPs), stipulating economic changes a\ncountry must make in order to make it better able to repay its loans.

Furthermore, aid\npackages and loan programs were generally designed to reflectWestern ideas of development.\nThis could be viewed as further evidence of neocolonialism in the region.\nForsomecountries,theinterestpaymentsalonefarexceedwhattheyareabletopay.Globally,\n39countries,33ofwhichareinSub-SaharanAfrica,havebeenidentifiedasheavilyindebtedpoor\ncountriesandeligiblefordebtreliefthroughajointventurebyIMFandWorldBank.Changeshave\nbeen made to the program to specifically address poverty in these countries and shift the loan\npayment amounts to funding for social and public services.\nIncreasingly, African countries are partnering with investment groups rather than lending\norganizations and private investment now exceeds development assistance. China is Africa\u2019s\nlargesttradingpartnerandthecountryhasinvestedbillionsinAfricaninfrastructureprojectsand\ndirect aid. Chinese investment projects include a $12 billion coastal railway in Nigeria and a $7\nbillion \u201cmini city\u201d in South Africa. In Angola, Chinese investors built Kilamba New City, a town\ncomplete with 25,000 homes, schools, and commercial facilities, to be repaid by Angolan oil (see\nFigure 6.11). SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 123\nFigure 6.11: Kilamba New City, Angola (\u00a9 Santa Martha, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nFor low-income individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa, microfinance has provided a way to access\na range of financial and investment services. These services might include small loans, known\nas microcredit.

Much of\nAfrica\u2019s economic growth has resulted from trade, and the region is rich in resources and has a\nlarge labor pool. However, despite significant mineral, agricultural, and energy resources, most\npeople in the region remain impoverished. Africa\u2019s leading export, for example, is petroleum and\npetroleum products, and yet most Africans do not have access to a reliable source of electricity.\nPoliticalinstability,too,haslimitedthebenefitofeconomicgrowthformanylow-incomeAfricans.\nEconomic growth, if invested in infrastructure and public services, combined with increased\neducational and career training opportunities could improve incomes in the region.

Have a big\nchunk of land might be mostly surrounded by water? Let\u2019s make it a region! Sometimes, though,\nmakingthesesortsofdivisionsismoredifficult.Africa,forinstance,isalmostentirelysurrounded\nby water except for a small land connection with Asia at Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula. But Sub-Saharan\nAfrica isphysiographically, culturally, andlinguistically distinct fromtheAfrican countries northof\nthe Sahara. In fact, North Africa has much more in common in terms of its physical and religious\nlandscape with the Arabian Peninsula and Southwest Asia than some of its continental neighbors\nto the south (seeFigure 7.1).\n125 126 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 7.1: Map of North Africa and Southwest Asia (CIA World Factbook, Public Domain)\nHistorically, this perhaps awkwardly named region of North Africa and Southwest Asia was\ncommonly called the \u201cMiddle East.\u201d This begs the question, though, what is it in the middle of?\nWhat is it east of? On a globe, east and west are relative terms. California is west of Europe but\neast of China. Indonesia is in Southeast Asia but is northwest of Australia. The equator might\nobjectively be in the middle of the globe, but the \u201cMiddle East\u201d is over 1,000 miles to its north.\nIn truth, the term \u201cMiddle East\u201d originated in Western Europe. Eastern Europe and Turkey were\ncommonly referred to as the \u201cNear East,\u201d while China was called the \u201cFar East.\u201d The \u201cMiddle East\u201d\nwas thus in between these two regions.\nReferring to the region as the \u201cMiddle East\u201d seems to privilege the European perspective, so\nwhat alternatives exist? Perhaps you could call it the Islamic World? This would exclude places\nlikeIsraelandseculargovernmentslikeTurkey,aswellasthenumerousminorityreligiousgroups\nfound in the region. You might have heard people refer to this area as the Arab World, but this\nwould not apply to Iran, much of Israel, or Turkey. Thus we are left with simply the descriptive\ngeographic name: North Africa and Southwest Asia, sometimes abbreviated as NASWA.\nWhatever its name, this region is the hearth area for several of the world\u2019s great ancient\ncivilizations and modern religions. The landscape of North Africa and Southwest Asia, as its\nnaming difficulties imply, is marked by regional differences: in culture, in language, in religion, in\nresources, and in precipitation. Even within countries, regional\nimbalances exist both in terms of the physical landscape and the patterns of human activity.\nOne of the most recognizable features of North Africa and Southwest Asia are its deserts. The\nSahara, from the Arabic word \u1e63a\u1e25r\u0101\u2018 meaning \u201cdesert,\u201d is the largest hot desert in the world,\nstretching across 9.4 million square kilometers (3.6 million square miles) of the North African\nlandscape. Although the typical image of the Sahara is its impressive sand dunes, most of the\ndesert is actually rocky (seeFigure 7.2). NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 127\nFigure 7.2: Sahara, Algeria (\u00a9 Cernavoda, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nTo the east, the Arabian Desert dominates the landscape of the Arabian Peninsula. In the\nsouthernportionofthisdesertistheRub\u2019al-Khali,thelargestcontiguoussanddesertintheworld.\nIt is also one of the world\u2019s most oil-rich landscapes.

C., Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A.,\nWikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThere are exceptions to this arid environment, however. The region has a number of fertile\nriver valleys and oases. The Nile River, for example, creates an arable floodplain in an otherwise\nextremely dry area (see Figure 7.4). While part of Iran is desert, northern Iran is actually home to\ndenserainforestsandthereareanumberofsceniclakes.CoastalTurkeyalongtheMediterranean\nis often called the Turquoise Coast owing to its scenic blue waters. In general, however, those\nareas of North Africa and Southwest Asia where there is more abundant plant life are due to the\npresence of rivers, lakes, and seas rather than to the presence of ample rainfall. NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 129\nFigure 7.4: Nile River Delta from Space (\u00a9 Jacques Descloitres, MODIS Rapid Response Team, NASA\/GSFC, Public\nDomain)\nIn a realm largely defined by its arid and hot climate, global changes in climate could have\nprofound effects. Climate and physical geography have already significantly constrained human\nsettlement and development patterns in North Africa and Southwest Asia. Rising temperatures\ncould exacerbate droughts, and heat waves and dust storms will likely become more frequent.\nIn some areas, conflicts over limited water resources have already begun. The Nile River, for\nexample, runs through ten different states and 40 percent of the entire population of Africa\nlives within its floodplain. Egypt consumes 99 percent of the Nile\u2019s water supply, though, putting\npressureonothercountries,likeSudan,tokeepwaterflowingdownstream.MuchofEgypt\u2019swater\ndemand is for the irrigation of cotton, but cotton actually requires a significant amount of water\nand is a nontraditional crop for such an arid environment. 130 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n7.2 CULTURAL ADAPTATIONS IN NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST\nASIA\nThe climate and physical geography of North Africa and Southwest Asia have shaped population\npatternsandcultureintheregion.Peopleintheregionaregenerallyclusteredaroundtheregion\u2019s\nsparse water resources reflecting ancient patterns of human settlement (see Figure 7.5).

Mesopotamia was also the site of the first urban civilization, called Sumer. Uruk, a city of\nSumer, had a population of over 50,000 people by 2500 BCE making it the most populous city in\nthe world at the time. The ancient city of Babylon, located between the Tigris and Euphrates, was\ninhabited for thousands of years and was likely the first city to reach a population of 200,000.

However, the way of life for many pastoral nomads in this region, like some Berbers,\nhas changed significantly in recent years. Many governments have encouraged these groups to\npractice settled agriculture rather than seasonal migration, and international boundaries have\noften cut off traditional migratory paths.\nThe Persians, from modern-day Iran, devised an innovative way to transport water known as a\nqanat.Qanatsareundergroundtunnelsusedtoextractgroundwaterfrombelowmountainsand\ntransport it downhill, where it is used to irrigate cropland (see Figure 7.7). They were developed\nover 2,500 years ago and many old qanats are still in use today in Iran as well as Afghanistan.\nFigure 7.7: Cross-section of a Qanat (\u00a9 Samuel Bailey, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)\nInsuchaharsh,aridenvironment,agriculturalpotentialisfairlylimited.Rivervalleysandcoastal\nareas provided small stretches of fertile land, but in the absence of widespread agricultural\ndevelopment, what other resources could bring this region wealth? In the early 20th century, oil\nwasdiscoveredinSaudiArabiaandthisnaturalresourcewouldprovebothablessingandacurse\nto the region.\nToday, Saudi Arabia remains the world\u2019s leading oil exporter, shipping over 7.3 million barrels\nperdayasof2015.Kuwait,Iran,Iraq,andtheUnitedArabEmiratesarealsoamongthetopseven\nglobal oil exporters.

The tallest building in the world is now the Burj Khalifa, located in Dubai,\nUnited Arab Emirates. Although the United Arab Emirates, in building this 828 meter (2,717 feet)\nmarvel, is seeking to diversify its economy and gain international recognition, its economy is still\nheavily dependent on oil.\nCountries in the developing world with oil resources have often been prone to authoritarian\nrule, slow growth, corruption, and conflict. Oil wealth has been used to finance armies, and\ncorrupt governments have pocketed oil revenue rather than reinvesting it in social programs or\ninfrastructure.Furthermore,placingsuchahighemphasisonexportingoneresource,likeoil,has\nmade this region vulnerable to changes in global energy demand.

Today, OPEC has 14 member states and covers over 40 percent of global oil exports (see\nFigure7.8).OPECcooperativelydetermineshowmuchoiltoproduceandcollectivelybargainsfor\nthe price of oil, rather than trying to compete to undercut one another. The United States and\nother countries have increased their own domestic oil production in recent years, causing OPEC\u2019s\nglobal share of oil exports to decline.\nFigure 7.8: Map of OPEC Member States (Map by Bourgeois, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nThe presence of oil has also left a colonial legacy across North Africa and Southwest Asia, and\nhas made these countries vulnerable to foreign control and influence. In addition, the uneven\ndistribution of oil resources and wealth has led to inequality both within and between countries.\nEthnic inequalities have also emerged as groups have uneven access to oil reserves and income. 134 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nOil has also changed the pattern of human settlement in the region by bringing in migrants from\noutside the realm attracted by the prospect of economic opportunity.\n7.3 THE RELIGIOUS HEARTHS OF NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST\nASIA\nNorth Africa and Southwest Asia is considered one of the great cradles of human civilization. It\nis also the hearth area for several of the world\u2019s major religions. These religions have changed\nthe global cultural landscape, but have also led to tension and conflict throughout the region.\nThreereligionsinparticular,Judaism,Christianity,andIslam,tracetheirancestrythroughthetribal\npatriarch Abraham, who may have lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE.\nThe oldest of these Abrahamic faiths is Judaism. Judaism is a monotheistic religion, meaning\nthat it is defined by a belief in one god. Jews believe that Abraham established the first covenant\nwith God and the central Jewish text, the Torah, includes a discussion of the creation of the world\nas well as the establishment of this covenant. The first Jewish temple, built by Solomon, was\nconstructed in modern-day Israel around 832 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed both the city of\nJerusalem and Solomon\u2019s Temple in 587 BCE, and many scholars note that this event led to the\ncreation of the written Hebrew Bible, what Christians term the Old Testament. The temple was\nreconstructed by Herod beginning in the 1st century BCE. However, this region has long been\nsubjecttoinvasionandconquestandin70CE,theSecondTemplewasdestroyedbytheRomans.\nThis event prompted large-scale Jewish emigration from the region.\nBoth temples in Jerusalem were largely places of sacrifice and God was believed to literally\ndwell within the space. Thus, early Judaism was a temple-centered religion. The destruction\nof the Second Temple marked a distinct turning point in Jewish history between the historical\nTemple Judaism and modern Rabbinic Judaism. If a Jewish person is no longer defined by the\nsacrifices they make at the Temple, then what is it that makes someone Jewish? Rabbis and the\ninterpretation of Jewish religious texts\nbecame centrally important to creating new ideas of Jewish identity.\nToday, there are around 14 million Jews worldwide; around 42 percent live in Israel, another 42\npercentliveinNorthAmerica,andtherestlivemostlyinEurope.Inaddition,Judaismdevelopeda\nnumberofdifferentbranchesincludingOrthodox,whichismoretraditional,Reform,whichisalso\nknownasProgressiveJudaism,andConservative,whichissomewhereinthemiddle.Conservative\nis the largest branch of Judaism worldwide. However, millions of Jews around the world consider\nthemselves to be unaffiliated or secular, emphasizing the ethnic and cultural values of the Jewish\nfaith rather than the religious theology.\nChristianity is another Abrahamic, monotheistic religion. It developed from the life and\nteachingsofJesus,aJewishpreacherwhowasbornin4BCEinJudea,locatedinmodern-dayIsrael.\nJesusbelievedthattheendtimeswerenearandemphasizedloveasthecentralreligiousdoctrine.\nHewascrucifiedbytheRomansaround30CE,amethodofexecutiontypicallyreservedforthose\nwho challenged the established social order.\nOriginally, Christianity was a sect of Judaism, but it eventually developed into its own, distinct\nreligious tradition. A number of councils were held during the early years of\nChristianity to create an agreed upon doctrine, though some of these decisions were disputed. NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 135\nOver the years, Christianity developed distinct branches and denominations. The first of these\ndivisions,knownastheGreatSchism,camein1054CEandwasasmuchaproductofgeographyas\ntheology. This split divided the Eastern Orthodox from the Roman Catholic churches. In 1517 CE,\nthe German monk Martin Luther penned The Ninety-Five Theses, which criticized Roman Catholic\ndoctrine and began the Protestant Reformation.\nChristianity is the largest religion in the world today with over 2.2 billion adherents. Although\nthere are a wide variety of individual Christian beliefs, Christians generally view Jesus as a divine\nfigureandbelievehewasresurrectedfollowinghisdeath.RomanCatholicismremainsthelargest\nsingle denomination of Christianity with 1.2 billion members particularly in Brazil, North America,\nWestern Europe, and parts of Africa and South America.\nThe religion that is most characteristic of North Africa and Southwest Asia today is Islam.\nIslam teaches in the existence of one God and emphasizes the belief in Muhammad as the last\nprophet.FollowersofIslamareknownasMuslims.IslambuildsuponmuchofJewishandChristian\ntheology.

Also\nlike Judaism, Islam has a monotheistic understanding of God; God is simply known in Islam as\nAllah, from the Arabic al-il\u0101h, meaning \u201cthe God.\u201d Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet, and\nmuch of the story of his death and life in the Qur\u2019an is similar to the story in the New Testament.\nMuhammad was born in Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia, in 570 CE. Beginning when he\nwas 40, Muslims believe that Muhammad began receiving revelations from God and later began\npreaching in his community. Muslims believe that the words of the Qur\u2019an, the holiest book\nin Islam, contain the words of God as revealed to the Muhammad. Qur\u2019an literally means \u201cthe\nrecitation\u201dinArabic.In622CE,afterwidespreadpersecution,Muhammadwasforcedtoemigrate\nto Yathrib, what is now the city of Medina, Saudi Arabia. This year marks the beginning of the\nMuslim calendar. In Yathrib, Muhammad gained converts and political authority and eventually\nthe Muslim forces from Yathrib conquered Mecca, where Muhammad later died in 632 CE.\nImmediately after Muhammad\u2019s death, disagreements arose over who should succeed\nMuhammad as the leader of the Muslim faith. Most Muslims believed that the leader\nof Islam should be the person who is most qualified. Today, this group represents the Sunni\nbranch of Islam. Others, however, believed that the only rightful leader must be a blood relative\nof Muhammad. This group is known as Shia, which derives from the Arabic phrase shi\u2019atu Ali\nmeaning \u201cfollowers of Ali,\u201d who was Muhammad\u2019s cousin and son-in-law. Sunni is still the largest\nbranchofIslamtoday,representingaround90percentofadherentswhileShiaconstitutearound\n10 percent of all Muslims (see\nFigure 7.9). 136 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 7.9: Map of Global Sunni and Shia Majorities (Derivative work from original by DinajGao, Public\nDomain)\nThe Five Pillars of Islam form the foundation for Muslim life and practice. First, the pillar of\nShahada refers to a declaration of faith. It is generally recited in Arabic but translates as \u201dThere is\nno god but God (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God.\u201d Stating this phrase with conviction\nis all that is required to convert to Islam. The pillar of Salat refers to prayer five times per day.\nWhen Muslims pray, they face the Kaaba in Mecca, a cubed structure that is considered to be the\nmost sacred Muslim site in the world (see Figure 7.10). The third pillar of Islam, Zakat, refers to\nthe giving of alms, or charity. Muslims are required to donate 2.5 percent of all assets each year. NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 137\nFigure 7.10: The Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia (\u00a9 Muhammad Mahdi Karim, Wikimedia Commons, GFDL 1.2)\nThe fourth pillar, Sawm, requires Muslims to fast during the month of Ramadan. During this\nmonth, adult Muslims abstain from food, drink, and sex during daylight hours. Those who are ill,\npregnant, elderly, or are otherwise unable to fast are exempt from the requirement. The month-\nlong fast is designed to bring Muslims closer to God, but also to remind them of the feeling of\nhungerinthehopesthattheywill bemindful ofthosewhoarelessfortunatethroughout therest\nof the year.\nFinally, the fifth pillar of Islam is hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca that is expected for all physically\nandfinanciallyableMuslimstocompleteatleastonceintheirlifetime.Duringthehajj,whichlasts\nseveral days, Muslims complete a series of rituals, some dating back to the time of Abraham. In\n2012, a record 3.16 million pilgrims completed the hajj and crowd control has been a significant\nconcern as the numbers of pilgrims have swelled. Since 1990, several stampedes have occurred;\nthe deadliest was in 2015 and killed over 2,000 people.\nIslam is the majority religion in every state in this realm except for Israel. Globally, Islam has\naround1.8billionfollowersandisthefastest-growingoftheworld\u2019sreligions.Althoughthisregion\nis largely united by a belief in Islam, the divisions within the faith as well as the presence of\nnumerous minority religious groups has often led to conflict. 138 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n7.4 CONQUEST IN NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA\nAfter Muhammad\u2019s death, Arab military forces carried Islam across the region. At its greatest\nextent, the Islamic Empire under the Umayyad Caliphate of the 7th and 8th centuries stretched\nacross 15 million square kilometers (5.79 million square miles), from the Iberian Peninsula, the\nsouthwest corner of Europe containing Spain and Portugal, all the way across North Africa and\nthe Arabian Peninsula and into Pakistan (see Figure 7.11). No empire would be larger until the\nMongols in the 13th century.\nFigure 7.11: Map of the Islamic Empire under the Umayyad Caliphate Expansion, 622-\n750 CE (Derivative work from original by Brian Szymanski, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nThe Islamic Empire continued for hundreds of years. Its capital moved from Medina to\nDamascus, the capital of modern-day Syria, and then to Baghdad, the capital of modern-day Iraq.\nBy 1259 CE, however, much of this region, including Baghdad, was conquered by the Mongols,\nbeginning a pattern of occupation and conquest that would\ncontinue until modern times.\nThe Ottoman Empire, based in modern-day Turkey, followed, taking control of much of North\nAfrica and coastal Southwest Asia by the 15th and 16th centuries. Though it declined over time,\nthe Ottomans maintained control of much of the region until it, along with the Central Powers of\nGermany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria, lost World\nWar I. Following World War I, the allied powers of Europe divided the former territory of the\nOttoman Empire and carved out colonies.\nThe League of Nations, an intergovernmental organization which lasted from the end of World\nWar I until the beginning of World War II, portioned the former Ottoman Empire and granted\nmandates for European powers to control parts of its territory. France, for example, was given a NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 139\nmandate for Syria. Britain was given a mandate to control Iraq as well as Palestine. The Italians,\ntoo, were able to take a piece of the Ottoman Empire, gaining control of Libya in the early 20th\ncentury.\nAs with many other parts of the world, the colonies of North Africa and Southwest Asia were\nformed with little attention to underlying ethnic tensions or resource issues. Some ethnic groups\nfound themselves split amongst several different European colonies, while others were forced\nto share newly created territories with hostile groups. Even once colonies were able to get\nindependence,thesecolonial-eraissueswouldremain.Unevenlydistributedoilwealth,whichwas\nnot discovered in large quantities until after the withdraw of European powers, would further\ncomplicate political and economic stability in the region.\n7.5 THE MODERN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF NORTH AFRICA AND\nSOUTHWEST ASIA\nToday\u2019spoliticalmapofNorthAfricaandSouthwestAsiareflectssuperimposedboundariesanda\nlegacy of colonialization. The countries of this region have often been prone to political instability\nandconflict,andreligioustensionbothbetweenMuslimsinthisregionaswellaswiththeregion\u2019s\nmany religious minorities has often led to violence.\nOne key issue is that the geography of this region has often restricted development and transit\ntofairlynarrowchannels.Conflictcanoftenoccuroverthecontrolofthesechokepoints.Achoke\npointisanarrowpassagetoanotherregion,suchasacanal,valley,orbridge.NorthAfricaandthe\nMiddle East has several, strategically important choke points including the Hormuz Strait, which\nprovidestheonlyseapassageintothePersianGulf,andtheSuezCanal,whichwasbuilttoconnect\nthe Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. Who controls these choke points, and who they allow\nthrough, has often been a point of contention.\nEuropean colonizers were generally slow to relinquish control in the region. Local groups often\nreacted violently in trying to secure independence. As a result, many newly created governments\nin the region consisted of military groups. In other cases, monarchs found either military support\nor joined with local religious leaders. For many areas in this region, the discovery of oil brought\nabout significant wealth, but also reignited Western interest and involvement. During the Cold\nWar, for example, the United States sought to limit Soviet influence in the region and maintain its\nsupply of oil.\nConservative religious ideology has sometimes provided a reaction against Westernization and\nforeign influence. In Iran, for example, the 1979 Islamic Revolution was largely a reaction against\nWesternization under a US-backed leader. The revolution established a theocracy in Iran,\nmeaning a rule by religious authority, with the Grand Ayatollah, a Shia religious cleric, as the\nsupreme leader.\nAfter the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Saud dynasty partnered with the leader of\nthe Wahhabi religious movement, creating the foundation of modern Saudi Arabia. Wahhabism\nis a strict form of Sunni Islam that promotes ultraconservative Muslim values. Women have a\nstrict dress code emphasizing modesty and have guardians, usually a father, brother, uncle, or\nhusband,andneedtheirguardian\u2019sconsenttomakemajordecisionsortravel.Until2018,women\nwereforbiddenfromdriving.AnumberofotherpracticesareforbiddenbyWahhabism,including 140 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nwatchingnonreligioustelevisionprograms,playingchess,anddancing.Thepenaltiesforbreaking\nthese prohibitions are often severe.\nInAfghanistan,agroupofmilitantSunnis,knownasal-Qaeda,foughtagainsttheSovietUnion\u2019s\ninvasion of Afghanistan.

They are known for their brutal oppression against women and acts of terrorism\nagainst civilian targets. As countries have modernized, Westernization and conservative religious\nvalues have continued to clash.\nThelandscapeofNorthAfricaandtheMiddleEastremainsinflux.Themostwidespreadpolitical\nchange in recent years was a wave of protests and revolutions known as the Arab Spring. The\nArab Spring began in Tunisia in 2010 when a fruit vendor set himself on fire after being harassed\ncontinually by police. Widespread protests in Tunisia followed his death, calling for changes to\nthe country\u2019s issues with corruption, high unemployment, lack of political and personal freedom,\nand high food prices. After just ten days of demonstrations, Tunisia\u2019s president, Ben Ali, who had\nbeeninpowerfor23years,fledinexile.FromTunisia,protestsspreadacrosstheregion,attimes\ntoppling governments that had been in power for decades (seeFigure 7.12).\nFigure 7.12: Map of the Arab Spring (Derivative work from original by Kudzu1, Wikimedia Commons)\nAt the heart of the causes behind the Arab Spring is inequality. In much of this region of the\nworld, wealth and power is concentrated in the hands of a select few. Young people in the region NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 141\nin particular had high levels of education but also high unemployment and played a central role\nin bringing about change. Social media was also used to organize and rally support, and diffused\nthe revolution rapidly. Several of the countries that experienced an initial change in regime have\nseen several later waves of political change, as interim governments sometimes proved to be as\nineffective as previous leadership.\nIn Syria, however, despite widespread initial protests and calls for a change in leadership,\npresident Bashar al-Assad not only refused to step down, but violently opposed protestors.\nSyria has been ruled by the Ba\u2019ath political party, a socialist and nationalist group seeking Arab\nunity, since the 1960s. Bashar al-Assad was elected president under a 2000 referendum and\nran unopposed, giving some indicator of the lack of political freedom in the country. Soldiers\nwere ordered to open fire on civilian protestors and many were killed or tortured. Eventually,\nthe country declined into civil war, with the government fighting rebel groups who sought to\noverthrow it and civilians caught\nin the crossfire.\nThecivilwarinSyriaalsoofferedanopportunityforanothergroupintheregiontogaincontrol\nofterritory.ISIS,theIslamicStateinIraqandSyria,alsoknownastheIslamicStateinIraqandthe\nLevant(ISIL)orjusttheIslamicState(IS),emergedin2014asaSunniextremistgroupopposingthe\nUnitedStates\u2019invasionofIraq.IraqhadbeenruledbytheminoritySunnipopulationforcenturies,\nbutwiththeoverthrowofthen-presidentSaddamHussein,alsoamemberoftheBa\u2019athparty,the\nmajorityShiapopulationtookcontrol.EffortstocreateacoalitiongovernmentandincludeSunnis\naswellastheotherminoritygroupsinthecountrybrokedown.SomeoftheSunniswhohadbeen\npolitical leaders or military personnel under Saddam Hussein formed ISIS and were eventually\nable to drive out Iraqi government forces in several key cities.\nFrom there, the group gained control of parts of Syria. For some time, much of Iraq and\nSyria existed as an insurgent state, a territory beyond the control of government forces. ISIS\nis widely known for its brutal tactics, including beheadings, sexual violence, and fundamentalist\ninterpretation of Islam. The group sought to create a worldwide Islamic State with every Muslim\ncountry under its control. The United States declared ISIS defeated in 2019, though researchers\nnote that while the US indeed took control of the last pieces of territories held by ISIS, thousands\nof ISIS fighters remain dispersed across Iraq and Syria and the group has the support of other\naffiliate groups and fighters across the world.\nSince2011,thepeopleofSyriahaveenduredgovernmentassaults,violencefromrebelgroups,\nand attacks from ISIS. Over 400,000 Syrians have been killed, many of them civilians, and over\n13 million have become refugees. Some refugees have remained in Syria, cut off from aid by\ngovernment and insurgent groups. Around 4.8 million people have left Syria. Some have fled\nto Turkey and Greece by boat; many have died on the perilous journey. Europe and North\nAmericahavedebatedwhethertoacceptthesemigrants,withsomecountriesarguingthatSyrian\nmigrants might actually be terrorists, and others acknowledging that the global community has a\nresponsibility to help those in need. 142 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n7.6 RELIGIOUS CONFLICT IN NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA\nThe rise of ISIS is representative of many key issues of geography in this region: the intersection\nof religious values, political instability, and control of territory and resources. ISIS represents a\nfundamentalist view of Islam, known as Islamism. Islamism is characterized by a strict, literal\ninterpretation of the Qur\u2019an, conservative moral values, and the desire to establish Islamic values\nacross the entire world. Militant Islamist movements have inspired the violent ideology of\njihadism, which seeks to combat threats to the Muslim community.\nIslamism and jihadism represent a small portion of global Muslim beliefs, however. A Pew\nResearch Center survey found that in most countries, over three-quarters of the population of\nMuslims reject Islamic extremism and a majority expressed concern over religious extremism.\nFurthermore, even in North Africa and Southwest Asia, only one-quarter ofMuslims believed that\ntensions within the community between more religious and less religious Muslims represented a\nmajor problem. In every religious community, there are fundamental interpretations of scripture\nand both conservative and liberal understandings of theology.\nFor traditional Muslims, religious life and personal life are intertwined, and thus political\nstructures in this region have often reflected religious values. Several states in North Africa and\nSouthwest Asia have declared sharia law, meaning that Islamic religious law applies in the court\nsystem (see Figure 7.13). Islamist groups in particular have often utilized a strict and harsh\ninterpretation of sharia. In many countries, most Muslims believe that sharia should be the state\nlaw,butmanybelieveitshouldonlyapplytothecountry\u2019sMuslimpopulation.Inaddition,Muslims\ndifferintheirinterpretationofsharia,withsomeonlysupportingshariaforpersonaldisputesbut\nnot accepting sharia\u2019s harsh punishments for various offenses.\nFigure 7.13: Map of Sharia Law by Country (\u00a9 S\u00e9mhur, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nIn a region where political boundaries were often contrived by outside forces, governments\nhave struggled with their relationship to minority religious and ethnic groups. The modern state\nof Israel, for example, was created following World War II by a United Nations plan to partition NORTH AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ASIA 143\nthe British-controlled Palestine into Arab and Jewish areas. A series of wars between Israel and\nthe surrounding Arab states left Israel as an independent state in control of the territories of the\nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, which were originally intended to be Palestine. Jerusalem, which\nunder the UN plan would be a neutral, international city because of its significance to several of\nthe world\u2019s religions, was proclaimed the capital of Israel.\nConflict continues between Palestinians living in territory controlled by Israel and Israelis who\nmaintain sovereignty over the entire area (see Figure 7.14). Israel has built a series of walls\ndividing the West Bank and Gaza from the areas of Israeli control, maintaining that they are\nto protect Israelis from Palestinian terrorists. For Palestinians, however, these walls limit their\nfreedom of movement and have often separated them from their livelihoods. The Gaza strip\nremains completely isolated, surrounded by walls on three sides and a sea controlled by Israeli\nshipsontheother.Somehavesuggestedatwo-statesolutionandthecreationofanindependent,\nPalestinian state, but Israeli construction of homes in the West Bank has limited that option. 144 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 7.14: Map of Israel and the Palestinian Territories (Map by Scott, Wikimedia\nCommons, Public Domain)\nNorthAfricaandSouthwestAsiaisaregionoftheworldthatisthecradleofancientcivilizations\nandmodernreligions,butwhereresourcesarelimitedandunevenlydistributed.Religioustension\nandpoliticalconflicthavepersisted.SomegroupslikeISIShavetakenadvantageofinstabilityand\nvaluable resources like oil to carve out control of territory and finance armed insurgencies.

Much of the\nimpressive physical geographic features of South Asia are the result of tectonic activity.

SOUTH ASIA 147\nFigure 8.2: Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate Boundary\n(United States Geological Survey, Public Domain)\nThis massive tectonic collision resulted in perhaps the most well-known physical feature in\nSouth Asia: Mount Everest.

Its highest peak, K2, is the second-\nhighestmountainintheworldandfarfewerpeoplehavesuccessfullymadeittothetopcompared\nto Everest. One in four people die while attempting to summit.\nAnother key physical feature of South Asia, the Deccan Plateau, was also formed from the\nregion\u2019s tectonic activity. Around 65 million years ago, there was an enormous fissure in Earth\u2019s 148 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\ncrust which led to a massive eruption of lava. The entire Indian peninsula was buried in several\nthousand feet of basalt, a type of dense, volcanic rock.\nSouth Asia\u2019s rivers, including the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra form a lowland region that\nwas home to several ancient civilizations. Today, these rivers provide for the water needs of\nmany of this region\u2019s people, irrigation for agricultural lands, and an abundance of fish. However,\nthese rivers have had significant environmental concerns in recent years and have supported\nincreasing numbers of people along their banks. Most of the area along the Ganges River, for\nexample, has been converted into urban or agricultural land and the wild species like elephants\nand tigers that used to be present along the river are now gone. Pollution in the Ganges River\nhas reached unprecedented levels as industrial waste and sewage is dumped untreated into the\nriver despite the fact that people frequently use the water for bathing, washing, and cooking. It is\nestimated that around 80 percent of all illnesses in India result from water-borne diseases. The\nWorld Bank has loaned India over $1 billion to clean up the river, but experts believe that larger\nscale infrastructure improvements are needed to improve the region\u2019s water quality.\nFigure 8.3: Map of Monsoon Onset Dates (\u00a9 Saravask, based on work by\nPlanemad and Nichalp, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0) SOUTH ASIA 149\nThe most important climatic feature of South Asia is a dramatic weather cycle known as the\nmonsoon (see Figure 8.3). The monsoon refers to seasonal shifts in wind that result in changes\nin precipitation. From October to April, winds typically come from the northeast in South Asia\ncreating dry conditions. Beginning in April, however, winds shift to the southwest, picking up\nmoisture over the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal.\nMost of the rain during the monsoon season results from orographic precipitation, caused\nwhen physical barriers form air masses to climb where they then cool, condense, and form\nprecipitation (see Figure 8.4). India\u2019s Western Ghats, a mountain range on its western coast, for\nexample,causesorographicprecipitationonitswindwardside.TheHimalayaMountainssimilarly\nresult in orographic precipitation. However, these impressive highland areas are so formidable\nthat they cause a dry area on their leeward side, known as a rain shadow. On one side of the\nHimalayas are some of the wettest places on Earth with over 30 feet of rain each year. On the\nother side, the rain shadow from the mountains forms the arid Gobi Desert and Tibetan Plateau.\nFigure 8.4: Orographic Precipitation (\u00a9 Saperaud~commonswiki, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThe monsoon rains, though extreme, provide significant benefits for South Asia\u2019s agriculture\nand economy. India gets more than 80 percent of its yearly rainfall from the monsoon and\nthe rains are essential for both subsistence and commercial agriculture in the region. A good\nmonsoon year will replenish the region\u2019s water supplies and increase crop yields, driving down\nfoodprices.Amplerainfallalsocontributestotheregion\u2019shydroelectricitypotential.However,the\ntorrential rains of the monsoon can also cause widespread flooding, destroying agricultural lands 150 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nand transportation infrastructure, and can contribute to water-borne and insect-borne illnesses\ndue to the significant amounts of standing water.\nThemonsoonischanging,though.Globalchangesinclimatehavemadethemonsoonharderto\npredict.Inaddition,risingnumbersofautomobilesacrossSouthAsiahaveincreasedairpollution,\nwhich can interfere with the mechanics of the monsoon. In the past, once the monsoon season\nstarts, rains continue throughout the season. Recently, though, the monsoon rains have begun\nto stop and start throughout the rainy season. People in this region are generally unprepared for\nan unpredictable or variable monsoon season and rely heavily on the rains for agriculture. Local\nleaders are pushing for more research to better understand the shifting monsoon rains and for\nincreased education on water conservation and sustainable agricultural management.\n8.2 PATTERNS OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT IN SOUTH ASIA\nSouthAsia\u2019srichculturallandscapeisaproductofitsvariedphysicalenvironmentandlonghistory\nofhumansettlement.Modernhumansfirstsettledinthisarea75,000yearsago,andearlyhuman\nancestors likely settled in the region hundreds of thousands of years before that. The first major\ncivilizationinSouthAsiawasintheIndusRivervalleybeginningaround3300BCE.Thiscivilization,\nlocatedinpresent-dayPakistan,Afghanistan,andnorthwesternIndia,reliedonthemonsoonrains\nto provide water to the Indus River. Here, early settlers developed systems of urban planning,\nbaked brick houses, and the civilization at its peak numbered over five million people.\nBy 1800 BCE, however, the Indus Valley civilization began to decline. Weakened monsoon rains\nlikely led to drought conditions and even small changes in precipitation and climate can have a\ndevastating effect on a population of five million. Although residents developed some systems\nof water supply, they largely depended on the monsoon rains for agriculture, and many began\nmoving to other areas of the region as arid conditions increased.\nAround 1500 BCE, the Aryans, an Indo-Iranian group from modern-day Iran, invaded northern\nIndia. The Aryans were speakers of Indo-Iranian languages and brought their language, known as\nSanskrit, their culture, and their ideas of social order to the South Asian realm. Hinduism and the\ncaste system would both emerge from the Aryan culture.\nSouth Asia was conquered by a number of different empires, each leaving an impact on the\ncultural landscape. The Maurya Empire stretched across the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain\nranges,extendingintomostofSouthAsiaby250BCEfollowedbyanumberofdifferentdynasties.\nIn the middle ages, the Islamic Empire extended into Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nIn the 18th century, however, the ruling Islamic Mughal Empire was in decline, leaving a power\nvacuum that would be exploited by the British. As the Industrial Revolution swept through the\nUnited Kingdom, the British were interested in expanding their supply of natural resources.\nThroughout the mid-18th century and the early 19th century, the British Empire, which had\nestablished the British East India Company, took over large stretches of land in India. The British\nestablished tea and cotton plantations, and took control of South Asia\u2019s resources. Although this\nregion had previously established successful trading systems, the British saw local industries as\ncompetition and shifted their development to export raw materials. British rule also increased\nWesternization in South Asia and created an extensive rail transportation system. SOUTH ASIA 151\nAs time went on, there were rising demands for independence. Mohandas K. Gandhi, known\nin India by the title \u201cMahatma,\u201d was a London-educated lawyer and one of the leaders in India\u2019s\nstruggle for independence. He organized local communities to participate in nonviolent protests\nand his commitment to nonviolent resistance would inspire later civil rights leaders like Martin\nLuther King Jr.\nThroughout this time, the isolated Himalayan countries of Nepal and Bhutan largely existed\nas buffer states, caught between the powerful British Empire and China. Their relative isolation\nallowedthemtodevelopuniqueculturalfeatureswithlittleinfluencefromoutsidegroups,butas\nwithmostbufferstates,leftthemwithlesseconomicandindustrialdevelopmentthantheirmore\npowerful neighbors.\nThe British eventually agreed to withdraw from India but political and religious differences\nresulted in a partition of the former British territory in 1947 (see Figure 8.5). Areas that were\nmajority Hindu would become the secular state of India. Areas that were majority Muslim would\nbecome the new Islamic state of Pakistan. Since Muslims were clustered both in modern-day\nPakistan and along the mouth of the Ganges on the coastal Bay of Bengal, the Muslim state of\nPakistan would be divided into a Western and an Eastern territory. This prompted large-scale\nmigrations of Hindus and Muslims who were on the \u201cwrong\u201d side at the time of the partition. 152 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 8.5: Partition of British India and Migration (Derivative work from original by\nhistoricair, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nNot everyone in South Asia supported the partition plan. Gandhi, who had long called for\nreligious unity in the region, was opposed to the concept. Hundreds of thousands of people were\nkilled in violent riots. In 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who opposed the\npartition plan and Gandhi\u2019s commitment to nonviolence.\nFurthermore, although there were areas that were clearly majority Hindu or majority Muslim,\nreligiousminoritiesexistedthroughoutIndiaandnotallregionshadaneasytransition.Atthetime\nof the partition, states were free to decide whether they wanted to join Hindu India or Muslim\nPakistan. In the territory of Jammu and Kashmir in Northern India (see Figure 8.6), Muslims\ncomprised around 75 percent of the population but the maharaja, the Sanskrit term for \u201cgreat\nruler,\u201dwasHindu.Themaharajastruggledwiththedecision,andinthemeantime,Muslimrebels,\nbacked by Pakistan, invaded. He then gave the territory to India in exchange for military aid. SOUTH ASIA 153\nFigure 8.6: Map of the Disputed Areas of Jammu and Kashmir (Central Intelligence\nAgency, World FactBook, Public Domain)\nToday, Jammu and Kashmir still remains a contentious territory and there have been violent\nclashes in the past few decades over political control. In the 1950s, China, without the knowledge\nofIndia,builtaroadthroughthenorthernportionofthestateandwasgiventerritorybyPakistan.\nAlthough India claims the entire state, it controls the southern half of the state and about four-\nfifths of its population.

East Pakistan, long marginalized and\nculturallydiscriminatedagainstbyWestPakistan,gainedindependenceasthestateofBangladesh\nin 1971.\nAs a region, South Asia is now the most populous area in the world and is home to over 1.8\nbillion people. Some of the world\u2019s largest megacities are located here as well, including Delhi,\nIndia (population of 26 million in the entire metropolitan area), Karachi, Pakistan (population of 154 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n14 million, with some estimating that it is much higher) and Mumbai, India (population of over 21\nmillion). Despite the sizeable population, however, the region remains largely rural. Only around\n36 percent of people in Pakistan, 31 percent of people in India, and 28 percent of people in\nBangladesh live in cities. These relatively low levels of urbanization indicate that most people in\nthe region still practice agriculture.\nUrbanization is increasing, however, as industrialization and development have brought new\njobs to the cities. British colonization left the region with the English language which has proven\naneconomicasset,thoughithasalsoledtothemarginalization ofindigenous languages. Foreign\ncompanies have increasingly outsourced to India, taking advantage of a large, low-wage and\nEnglish-speaking labor pool. Outsourcing refers to contracting out a portion of a business to\nanother party, which might be located in a different country. Business processing in particular,\nsuch as call centers and information technology, has been outsourced and employs significant\nnumbers of people in India. India is also one of the global leaders in fiber production, and textile\nproduction remains an important part of Pakistan\u2019s and Bangladesh\u2019s economies as well.\nNepal and Bhutan remain isolated both in terms of physical geography and global economic\nintegration. Political uncertainty has generally hampered economic growth in Nepal but the\ncountry has been able to reduce its poverty rate considerably in recent decades. Tourism to\nNepal has also increased, though local leaders have expressed concern over mounting issues of\ntrash and pollution as a result of climbers flocking to Mount Everest. In the early 21st century,\nBhutan transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy and held its first\ngeneral election. Its government has promoted the measure of gross national happiness (GNH),\nasopposedtorelyingstrictlyonmeasuresofeconomicorindustrialdevelopmentandhassought\nsustainable ways to develop and urbanize.\n8.3 CULTURAL GROUPS IN SOUTH ASIA\nSouth Asia is a diverse region in terms of its ethnic landscape, culture, and religious beliefs.\nAs shown in Figure 8.7, in the northern portion of the region, the Indo-European languages\nlike Hindi dominate as a result of the Aryan invasion. Along the Himalayas, languages in the\nSino-Tibetan family dominate. In southern India, however, most groups speak a language in the\nDravidian family, comprised of the indigenous languages of South Asia that were present before\nthe arrival of the Aryans. These language families reflect broader differences in culture and\nethnicity,including particularreligiouspracticesandfoodcustoms.Thusthelabel\u201cIndiancuisine\u201d\nactually encompasses a diverse array of regional and traditional specialties. SOUTH ASIA 155\nFigure 8.7: Map of the South Asian Language Regions (\u00a9 Filpro, Wikimedia Commons, CC\nBY-SA 4.0)\nSouth Asia is a hearth area for several of the world\u2019s great religions. Out of the Aryan invasion\nof northern India came a religious belief system known as Vedism. The religious texts of Vedism,\nknownastheVedas,combinedwithlocalreligiousbeliefsdevelopedintothemodern-dayreligion\nof Hinduism by around 500 BCE. Hinduism is a polytheistic religion with a wide variety of\nindividual beliefs and practices. Hinduism is a highly regional and individual religion and its\npolytheistic nature reflects this open understanding of belief. Of Hinduism\u2019s over 1 billion\nfollowers, 95 percent live in India.\nAt its heart, there are four key features of Hinduism: dharma, karma, reincarnation, and\nworship. Dharma refers to the laws and duties of being and is different for every person. You\nmight be a student and an employee and a child and a sibling. All of those roles have prescribed\nresponsibilities.Tobeagoodstudent,forexample,meanstoattendclass,readthetextbook,and 156 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nstudy. In Hindu culture, therearealsorestraints and observances forhow you interact with other\npeople depending on their status.\nHindu views on the afterlife are quite different from the Judeo-Christian conception of heaven.\nHindus believe in karma, which means that your deeds, good or bad, will return to you. They\nalso believe in reincarnation, which is the idea that once you die, your spirit is reborn. Thus,\nyou are the sum of numerous past existences. Karma, dharma, and reincarnation go hand in\nhand. If someone had done good deeds, had good intentions, and lived virtuously, when they die\nand are reincarnated, they might come back as something great \u2013 a prince, perhaps. Conversely,\nif someone was a terrible person, accumulating an excess of negative karma, when they are\nreincarnated,theymightcomebackassomeoneofverylowstatus\u2013ormaybenotevenaperson\nat all.\nHindu scripture discusses four distinct castes, or groups, of people in society, an example of\nsocial stratification. This social hierarchy is known as the caste system. The Brahmins, the\nhighest caste, consist of priests and teachers and represent around 3 percent of India\u2019s total\npopulation. There is a warrior caste, a merchant caste, and finally the lowest, the laborer caste of\nlandless serfs. Excluded from this caste system, and viewed as so below it that they are not even\napartofit,arethe\u201cuntouchables,\u201d alsoknownas\u201cDalit\u201dmeaning\u201coppressed.\u201dTheuntouchables\nare so-named because they perform work that makes them spiritually unclean, such as handling\ncorpses, tanning hides, or cleaning bathrooms. Traditionally, higher castes would get ritually\npurified if they touch a Dalit. Many untouchables are indigenous, non-Aryan Indians.\nSohow might thebelief in karma and reincarnation affectsocial justice in South Asia? Although\nthe caste system was outlawed by the Indian constitution, widespread discrimination and\npersecution persists. Many Hindus believe that those in lower castes were reborn into that social\nstatus because they had committed misdeeds in their past life. However, other Hindus fought\nagainst the caste system and have worked to more fully integrate the Dalits into Indian society.\nBuddhismemergedoutofHinduisminnorthernIndiafollowingthelifeandteachingsofHindu\nprince Siddhartha Gautama. According to Buddhist belief, Siddhartha lived a life of luxury, but\nbecame disenchanted with his life of privilege when he was faced with society\u2019s injustices, such\nas illness and extreme poverty. Since Hinduism offered no clear cessation of what Siddhartha\nviewedasanendlesscycleofsufferingthroughsamsara,thesoul\u2019scontinualdeathandrebirth,he\nsoughtoutnewwaysofendingsuffering.Foratime,Siddharthapracticedmeditationandextreme\nasceticism, eating only dirt and bits of rice. But neither the path of luxury nor the complete\nabsenceofworldlypleasuresgavehimtheinsighthesought.Eventually,Siddhartha,inmeditation\nunder a Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, discovered what Buddhists refer to as the Middle Way, a\npath of moderation. He is said to have achieved enlightenment and is known as the first Buddha,\nmeaning \u201cawakened one.\u201d\nAlthough Buddhism, like Hinduism, is a highly regional religion with many different forms of\nindividual expression, Buddhists generally share a belief in the Four Noble Truths: 1) Suffering is\nuniversal and inevitable, 2) The immediate cause of suffering is desire and ignorance, 3) There is\na way to dispel ignorance and relieve suffering, and 4) The eightfold path is the means to achieve\nliberation from suffering. Buddhists also share with Hindus a common belief in karma, dharma,\nand reincarnation.\nBuddhism diffused across Asia, though never taking a strong hold in India (see Figure 8.8). The\nMauryaEmperorAshoka,inparticular,wasresponsibleforthewidespreaddiffusionofBuddhism SOUTH ASIA 157\nin the 3rd century BCE. The religion has three primary branches, each with a distinct regional\nconcentration.Theoldestbranch,Theravada,isprimarilypracticedinSoutheastAsia,inplaceslike\nCambodia,Laos,Myanmar,andThailandandisalsothemajorityreligionontheSouthAsianisland\nofSriLanka.MahayanaispracticedbymostBuddhistsworldwide,particularlyinplaceslikeChina\nandJapan.VajrayanaBuddhism,whichissometimesconsideredasubsetofMahayanaBuddhism,\nis practiced in the Himalayas and Tibetan Buddhism is a notable example. Buddhism has around\n500 million followers worldwide.\nFigure 8.8: Map of Buddhism (\u00a9 Javierfv1212, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nAlthough Buddhism and Hinduism are the most widely practiced, South Asia was also a hearth\narea for the Jain and Sikh religions. Jainism emerged in India in the first century BCE and\nemphasizes ahimsa, nonviolence toward all living beings. Even insects found in the home are\ngently ushered out rather than killed. Jains also seek to break free from attachments and inner 158 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\npassions, and aim to keep an open mind toward different perspectives. The teachings of Jainism\nwere influential for Gandhi and his emphasis on nonviolent resistance.\nSikhism emerged in the Punjab region of northwestern India and northern Pakistan in the\n15thcentury. Itisamonotheistic religion founded ontheteachings ofGuruNanak thatcombines\nelements of both Hinduism and Islam. Like Hindus, Sikhs believe in reincarnation and karma. But\nunlike Hinduism, Sikhism prohibits the worship of idols, images, or icons. Sikhs believe God has\n99 names, an adaptation of Hindu polytheistic belief. Sri Harmandir Sahib, commonly called the\n\u201cGolden Temple,\u201d in Amritsar, India is the holiest Sikh temple, which are called gurdwara (see\nFigure 8.9). However, the building is open to everyone and every visitor is offered a free meal.\nOver 100,000 people visit the site every day.\nFigure 8.9: Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar, Punjab, India (\u00a9 Oleg Yunakov, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThese religions, along with other minority religions like Christianity and indigenous belief\nsystems, have not always coexisted peacefully in South Asia.

SOUTH ASIA 159\n8.4 SOUTH ASIA\u2019S POPULATION DYNAMICS\nSouth Asia is the most populous region on Earth, but why is it the most populous, and how do\ngeographers study population? The simplest way to measure population is to count the number\nofpeopleinanarea.India,forexample,hasapopulationofover1.3billion,makingitthesecond-\nmost populous country after China. But do raw numbers of people tell the whole story of the\nhuman population in an area? If two countries have the same population, but one is far smaller\nthan the other, how could we examine population in a way that explores this difference?\nGeographers often use the concept of density to investigate population. Arithmetic density is\nfairly easy to calculate. It is determined by simply taking the number of people in an area divided\nby the size of the area. If a territory was one kilometer square, for example, and was home to\n100people,thearithmeticdensitywouldbe100peoplepersquarekilometer.Althougharithmetic\ndensity iseasy tocalculate, itgives usafairly limited view ofpopulation density. What if thereare\ntwo tracts of land that are the same size and have the same number of people, but one is lush\nand fertile and has people spread out evenly and the other has a tiny river that everyone lives\nnear? If you were using arithmetic density, the measurements for these two areas would be the\nsameeventhoughtheactualsettlementpatternsarequitedifferent(seeFigure8.10).Physiologic\ndensity takes into account this difference by examining the number of people per unit of arable,\nor farmable, land.\nFigure 8.10: Arithmetic and Physiologic Density (Figure by author) 160 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nArithmetic and physiologic density can give us insight into the concentration of a country\u2019s\npopulationandallowsustomakecomparisonsbetweencountries.TheUnitedStates,afairlylarge\ncountry, for example, has an arithmetic density of 32 people per square kilometer. However, a\nrelativelysmallpercentageofUSlandisarable,sothephysiologicdensityis179peoplepersquare\nkilometer. Bhutan, by comparison, has a low population density of only 14 people per square\nkilometer. However, its rugged mountain environment means that only around 2 percent of the\nlandisfarmable,soitsphysiologicdensityis606peoplepersquarekilometer.Bymostmeasures,\nthe most densely populated place in the world is Singapore with an arithmetic density of 6,483\npeople per square kilometer and a physiologic density of 441,000 people per square kilometer.\nAnother way to measure population is agricultural density which is the ratio of the number\nof farmers to the area of land. In developing countries where many people work as farmers,\nagriculturaldensityisveryhigh.SouthAsiahasahighagriculturaldensity.Indevelopedcountries,\ncommercial agriculture and technological innovations have allowed relatively few people to be\nfarmers and agricultural densities are generally low.\nGeographers can also examine how a population is growing and changing over time. One\nway to explore this is with a population pyramid, a graphical representation of a population\u2019s\nage groups and composition of males and females. Ages of people are grouped in cohorts with\nyounger people on the bottom and older on the top. Thus, a population pyramid that is very\ntriangular has a lot of young people and is growing rapidly.\nTypically, the ratio of males to females, known as the sex ratio, is 1 to 1 and population\npyramids will have even sides. However, in populations where males are favored, the ratio may\nbe skewed. Similarly, in countries where men have died in war, such as in World War II Germany,\nthere might be more females. When geographers and population demographers refer to sex, it\nmeans something different from gender; sex is a person\u2019s biological identity as male or female\nwhile gender refers to a person\u2019s role as a \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d within society.\nIndia\u2019s2017populationpyramidrevealsrapidpopulationgrowthoverthepastfewdecades(see\nFigure8.11).However,thelevelingoffatthebaseofthepyramidindicatesthatpopulationgrowth\nmay be slowing. In addition, India\u2019s cultural preference for male children is clearly apparent.\nAmong children aged zero to four, India has 62 million males and only 55 million females.\nNationwide, there are over 47 million more males in India than females. Both abortion and\ninfanticide have contributed to this imbalance. SOUTH ASIA 161\nFigure 8.11: India\u2019s Population Pyramid, 2017 (U.S. Census Bureau, Public Domain)\nAll of the population pyramids for the countries in this region reveal preferences for male\nchildren,thoughnoneareassevereanimbalanceasIndia.AlthoughPakistan\u2019spopulationgrowth\nhas slowed in the past decades, its fertility rate remains the highest in the region at around 3.5,\nmeaning a woman in Pakistan, on average, will have 3.5 children.\n8.5 FUTURE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN SOUTH ASIA\nIndia\u2019s male-skewed population pyramid is indicative of a larger issue of gender inequality in its\nsociety. Sexual violence in particular continues to be a significant issue. Although the percentage\nofwomenwhohavebeenrapedinIndia islowerthaninothercountries, amajority ofrapecases\nare never reported and even an incidence rate of 8 or 9 percent in a population of over 1 billion\npeople means that tens of millions of women have been victimized. The government of India has\ntaken steps to reform its criminal code so that more criminals are prosecuted but even after a\n2013 reform, marital rape continues not to be a crime. In a country that has few female police\nofficers,highratesofdomesticviolence,andarelativelylowstatusofwomen,sexualviolencewill\nlikely remain a problem until these broader, systemic issues are addressed.\nOverall, South Asia\u2019s growing population will have a significant impact on its geography. Much\nof the historic growth in this region was supported by the Green Revolution, which refers to\nchanges in agricultural technology and productivity beginning in India in the 1960s. In 1961, India\nwas at risk of widespread famine when a hybrid rice seed was developed that yielded ten times 162 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nmore rice than traditional seeds. It was called \u201cMiracle Rice\u201d and its use spread throughout Asia.\nDespite these agricultural advances, South Asia has the highest rates of child malnutrition of any\nworld region. The low status of women in particular contributes to a lack of knowledge about the\nnutrients that are needed for children. Around one in three children in India are underweight.\nEconomically, South Asia has experienced rising prosperity yet systemic issues of governance\nand poverty remain. India in particular has one of the world\u2019s largest economies and the fastest\ngrowingeconomyintheregion.Thiseconomicgrowthhasmainlybeenfocusedonurbancenters,\ndrawing large numbers of people from the rural countryside to the cities in hope of finding work.\nMany cities have been unable to accommodate the rapid migration, however, and the sprawling\nslumsinIndia,Pakistan,andBangladeshareindicativeofinadequateinfrastructureandeconomic\ninequality. Several factories in this region have collapsed in recent years, killing thousands of\nworkers and highlighting the poor working condition of many South Asians.\nWhat does the future hold for South Asia? Although economic growth has reduced poverty in\nIndia, down from 60 percent in 1981 to 25 percent in 2011, corruption has increased. Inequality\nbetween genders, religious groups, castes, and ethnic groups remains a problem in much of\nthe region. In some cases, this has led to communal conflict, which refers to violence between\nmembers of different communities. In Sri Lanka, a majority Buddhist country, ethnicity and\nreligion are closely linked. Buddhists here have shaken the traditional peaceful image of their\nreligion and have engaged in violent conflict with the minority Tamils and Muslims.\nStill, local government and community leaders have sought to escape the shadow of the 20th\ncentury\u2019s turmoil by embracing new models of development and cooperation. In Bhutan, for\nexample,thegovernmentinitiativetomeasuregrossnationalhappinessresultedinshiftingurban\namenities, such as schools and healthcare clinics, to rural areas. This slowed the rural to urban\nmigration that was rapidly occurring in other parts of the realm. Despite political and military\nturmoil, Pakistan has been able to substantially decrease its poverty rate. South Asia remains a\ncomplex realm at the crossroads of modernization and traditional cultural and religious values. CHAPTER 9\nEast and Southeast Asia\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Identify the key geographic features of East and Southeast Asia\n\u2022 Explain how East and Southeast Asia\u2019s history has affected its geographic landscape\n\u2022 Describe the patterns of economic development in East and Southeast Asia\n\u2022 Analyze how East and Southeast Asia interacts within the global economic system\n9.1 THE PHYSICAL LANDSCAPE OF EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA\nEast and Southeast Asia (see Figure 9.1) contains the world\u2019s most populous country, the most\npopulous metropolitan area, and some of the world\u2019s oldest civilizations. It is also a region with\nintense internal disparities and a landscape that has been and continues to be transformed by\nphysical, political, and economic forces. Although East and Southeast Asia are often divided into\ntwo regions, they share a common economic and political history and global geopolitical forces\ncontinue to transform this realm.\n163 164 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 9.1: Map of East and Southeast Asia (CIA World Factbook, Public\nDomain)\nTheregionofEastandSoutheastAsiaisdividedfromtherestofAsiabyanumberofformidable\nphysicalbarriers(seeFigure9.2).Inthenorth,Mongolia\u2019sAltayMountains,theMongolianPlateau,\nandtheGobiDesertseparatetheregionfromRussia.Inthesouth,theHimalayaMountainsdivide\nChinafromSouthAsiaandcontaintheworld\u2019shighestmountain,MountEverest.Thesemountains\naresohigh, in fact,thatthey formtheGobi Desertby preventing rainfall frompassing overSouth\nAsia into Central Asia. In the southeast, the Arkan Mountains and Naga Hills, which stretch across\nMyanmar and India, and the rolling hills of China\u2019s Yunnan Plateau separate Southeast Asia from\nthe rest of the continent. In general, this is a realm of relatively high relief, meaning there are\nsignificant changes in elevation on the landscape. Even the islands of this region have a rugged\ntopography, from Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji to Indonesia\u2019s Mount Carstensz. EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 165\nFigure 9.2: Physical Map of East and Southeast Asia (CIA World Factbook, Public\nDomain)\nThe rivers of this region have supported both ancient cultures and modern societies providing\nirrigation for agriculture, river transportation, and in some cases, hydropower. Asia\u2019s longest\nriver, the Yangtze, flows through central China; the economic activity surrounding its river valley\ngenerates around one-fifth of the entire country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). In 2003, the\nChinese government built the Three Gorges Dam, the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric power station,\nwhich spans the river. China\u2019s other major river, the Huang He River, also known as the Yellow\nRiver, flows through the highlands of Western China before discharging in Northeastern China.\nIt was on the banks of the Huang He that Chinese civilization first began. In Southeast Asia, the\nregion is dominated by the Mekong and Irrawaddy Rivers. The Mekong River, one of the most\nbiodiverse rivers in the world, has been heavily dammed, impacting the area\u2019s ecology, and plans 166 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nare underway to dam the Irrawaddy in several places. In addition, both the Mekong and the\nIrrawaddy originate in China, presenting issues over river flow and ownership.\nAlthough the construction of the region\u2019s numerous dams has provided reliable power, they\u2019ve\nbeen met with significant social and ecological impacts. The Three Gorges Dam, for example, was\nanunprecedentedengineeringmarvelandwillreducethepotentialfordownstreamflooding,but\nfloodingfromthecreationofthedamdisplacedoveronemillionpeopleandsignificantlyreduced\nforest area around the river.\nMost of the region\u2019s people live in the moretemperate climate zones. In EastAsia, for example,\nthe coastal regions of Central and Southern China, Japan, and South Korea are primarily a humid\ntemperate climate. Southeast Asia is largely tropical with ample rainfall throughout the year. The\nexception to these relatively warm areas are Western China, where the cold highland climate\ndominates, and Northeastern Asia is quite cold due to its high northern latitude.\nThe region\u2019s physical landscape has significantly affected its agricultural practices. The banks of\nEast and Southeast Asia\u2019s rivers provided early settlers with fertile soil, and even today, provide\nagricultural irrigation. The region\u2019s hilly terrain, though initially an obstacle to agricultural\nproductivity, inspired innovations such as terracing, cutting a series of flat surfaces resembling\nsteps on hillsides. China in particular continues to be a global leader in terms of agricultural\nproduction.\n9.2 NATURAL HAZARDS IN EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA\nMuch of what unites this region is its instability, not necessarily in terms of geopolitics, but rather\nits physical landscape. East and Southeast Asia are located in thePacific Ring of Fire, an area of\nhightectonicactivityalongthePacificOceanbasin(seeFigure9.3).Thevastmajorityoftheworld\u2019s\nearthquakes, around 90 percent, occur along this geologically unstable area. EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 167\nFigure 9.3: Map of the Pacific Ring of Fire (Map by Gringer, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nIn East and Southeast Asia, tectonic collisions have shaped the physical landforms present in\ntheregionandpresentnumerousnaturalhazards(seeFigure9.4).Volcanoeseruptinthisregion\nfrequently, and many of the islands in this region were actually formed from a variety of historic\nvolcanic eruptions. Japan\u2019s highest mountain peak, for example, the majestic Mount Fuji, is an\nactivevolcanothatlasteruptedintheearly18thcentury.The1815eruptionofIndonesia\u2019sMount\nTambora, one of its dozens of active volcanoes, was so powerful, it cooled global temperatures\nandcausedcropfailuresasfarawayasEgyptandFrance.In1883,thevolcanicislandofKrakatoa,\nbetween the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, erupted with such a violent explosion that\nit actually collapsed. Tens of thousands died and it took several years for global weather patterns\ntoreturntonormal.Thesoundoftheeruptionisconsideredtheloudestsoundinmodernhistory\nand could be heard from over 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles) away. 168 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 9.4: Map of Tectonic Plates in East and Southeast Asia (United States Geological Survey, Public Domain)\nAlongtheislandsofIndonesia,theAustralianPlateissubducting,ormovingbelow,theEurasian\nPlate. This has resulted in a subduction zone west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, an area\nof high seismic activity. In 2004, this subduction resulted in a massive undersea earthquake, so\npowerful that it actually shortened the day by a fraction of a second. The earthquake triggered\na series of tsunamis, high sea waves, which devastated coastal communities in 14 different\ncountries and killed 230,000 people. Tsunamis result from the displacement of water and can\nhave a variety of causes, such as a landslide, meteor impact, or undersea volcanic eruption. Most\ncommonly, though, they result from earthquakes.\nIn 2011, the most powerful earthquake to ever hit Japan, a magnitude 9.0, resulted in tsunami\nwavesover40meters(131feet)highinsomeareas.Theearthquakeandsubsequenttsunamileft\nover 15,000 dead and damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings. Most notably, the tsunami\ndamaged Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant causing a series of nuclear meltdowns\nand the release of radioactive material.\nSo what can be done about the danger from earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis in this\nregion? While nothing can stop Earth\u2019s massive tectonic plates from moving, warning systems,\nland use planning, and public education could help prevent casualties. After the 2004 Indonesian\nearthquake and tsunami, the international community created an Indian Ocean tsunami warning\nsystem. Although some of the hardest hit areas would have had only minutes to find higher EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 169\nground, the warning system could have had a significant impact in alerting areas ahead of the\nwave. In Japan, earthquake drills are common and strict building codes ensure that buildings can\nwithstand most seismic activity.\nIn addition to these geologic hazards, typhoons are also common in this region. Typhoons, the\ntermfortropicalcyclonesinthenorthwesternregionofthePacificOcean,routinelymakelandfall\nin East Asia. The region actually has more tropical cyclone activity than anywhere else on Earth.\nMost storms form in the summer between June and November and the islands of the Philippines\nare generally the hardest hit. Monitoring systems have been in place in the region for several\ndecades and have helped to minimize the impacts from these powerful storm systems.\n9.3 EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA\u2019S HISTORY AND SETTLEMENT\nThe history of human settlement in East and Southeast Asia begins in China. Evidence of modern\nhumanscanbefoundintheregiondatingbacktoover80,000yearsago.Around10,000yearsago,\nseveral cultural groups emerged in China during the Neolithic Period, also known as the New\nStone Age. This was a time of key developments in early human technology, such as farming, the\ndomesticationofplantsandanimals,andtheuseofpottery.AlongChina\u2019sYangtzeRiver,humans\nfirst domesticated rice around 6500 BCE. Villages, walled cities, and great dynasties, or families of\nrulers, emerged later.\nWhile some early humans stayed in East Asia, others followed the coastline and continued on\nto Southeast Asia likely over 50,000 years ago. This was during the glacial period known as the\nIce Age. Global temperatures were much colder and huge sheets of ice covered North America,\nEurope, and Asia. Since so much water was trapped\nin these huge glaciers, ocean levels were actually much lower than they are today. Indonesia,\nMalaysia, and the other islands of Southeast Asia were a single landmass known as Sunda\n(see Figure 9.5). Those cultural groups who had seafaring knowledge continued on, populating\nAustraliaandthesurroundingislands.DuringtheIceAge,thesouthernislandsofJapanwerealso\nconnected totherestofEurasia, allowing theindigenous groups ofJapan tomigrate fromwhat is\nnow mainland China. 170 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 9.5: Map of Southeast Asia 20,000 Years before Present (\u00a9 Maximilian D\u00f6rrbecker, Wikimedia Commons,\nCC BY-SA 3.0)\nIn East Asia, the Chinese dynasties dominated the political landscape for much of the region\u2019s\nhistory. They established trade routes, a strong military, and forged connections with Korea and\nJapan. China became a unified state under the Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE to 220 CE,\nand this long period of stability is viewed as\na golden age in Chinese history. The dominant ethnic group in China, the Han, take their name\nfrom this ruling family. It was also during this time that Confucianism became the state religion.\nConfucianism takes its name from the influential Chinese philosopher and teacher Kong Fuzi\n(551-479BCE),oftenreferredtobytheLatinizedversionofhisname,Confucius.OneofConfucius\u2019\nkey teachings was the importance of relationships, both within the family and within society as a\nwholeandthereligionemphasizeshumangoodnessandself-reflectionratherthantheworshipof EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 171\na divine being. Confucius also emphasized education and his teachings have dominated Chinese\nculture for centuries.\nIn general, the Chinese dynasties were largely isolationist. China has a number of physical\nbarriers that separate it from the rest of Asia, such as the Himalayas, the rugged western\nhighlands, and the Gobi Desert. The only region where it was vulnerable to invasion was its\nnortheastern region. Here, the ruling families of China built a series of walls, known today as\nsimply the Great Wall of China (seeFigure 9.6).\nFigure 9.6: Map of the Great Wall of China (\u00a9 Maximilian D\u00f6rrbecker, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.5)\nHowever, the term \u201cthe\u201d Great Wall of China is a misnomer. In fact, there is a series of\noverlapping walled fortifications that began being constructed by early dynasties in the 5th\ncenturyBCEandcontinuedthroughtothe17thcenturyCE.Wallsareadefensivemilitarystructure\nand are thus an expression of a civilization that wished to be left alone. Emperors generally\ndisregarded China\u2019s extensive coastline, and where port cities did emerge, they were primarily\nused for local trade.\nIn Southeast Asia, however, trade links with South Asia brought Hinduism and later Buddhism\nto the region. Port cities emerged, as well as cities that were religious or ceremonial centers. The 172 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nHindurulersoftheregionwereoftenviewedasdivine,butinordertosecurethefavorofthegods,\nandtheblessingsoftheHindupriests,theyagreedtobuildtemples.AngkorWat,inCambodia,for\ninstance,wasbuiltinthe12thcenturyastheking\u2019sstatetempleandcapitalcity(seeFigure9.7).It\nwas later transformed into a Buddhist temple, which it remains today. The temple complex is the\nlargest religious structure in the world.\nFigure 9.7: Angkor Wat Temple Complex, Cambodia (\u00a9 Bj\u00f8orn Christian T\u00f8orrissen, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n4.0)\nEventually, IslamspreadtoSoutheast Asia,particularly asaresultofSufi missionaries, partofa\nmystical branch of Islam. In the present-day islands of Malaysia and Indonesia, in particular, local\nrulers and communities embraced Islamic theology. Today, more Muslims live in Indonesia than\nin any other country on Earth.\nBuddhism continued to dominate the religious landscape of much of Southeast Asia as well as\ninJapan.DuringtheHeianperiod,lastingfromthelate8thcenturiestothe12thcenturyCE,many\nofthefeaturesofmodernJapanesecultureemerged,suchasitsdistinctiveartandpoetry,aswell\nas Buddhist-inspired architecture. A ruling class of warriors, known as a shogunate, would later\ntake control of Japan beginning a feudal period in the country\u2019s history.\nThe evolving landscape of this region would be completely transformed by colonization, with\nsweeping political and economic changes that continues to shape the geography of the region\ntoday. Beginning in the 16th century, European colonial empires became interested in Southeast\nAsia. Before long, Europeans established permanent colonies. The Spanish would settle the EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 173\nPhilippines, the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies in present-day Indonesia, the\nFrenchcreatedIndochinainmainlandSoutheastAsia,andtheBritishwouldtakeoverBurma,now\nknown as Myanmar, and Malaysia. By the 1800s, only Thailand would remain independent and\nfunctioned largely as a buffer state separating the British and French colonial spheres.\nJapan took note of these imperial pursuits. In 1868 CE, the Japanese Emperor Meiji ended the\nshogante and began a series of reforms known as the Meiji Restoration. As part of the reform,\nthe government sought to increase Japan\u2019s modernization and industrialization and began a\nsystematic study of the developed world. Why were some countries more powerful and more\nindustrialized than others? Britain, for example, was an island nation like Japan and yet was\nconsidered to be the most powerful country in the world. Education was critical, as was industrial\ntechnology, but Japanese leaders believed that Britain\u2019s colonial ambitions, its direct control over\nthe resources of other areas, was key to its success.\nBy the beginning of World War II, Japan had built up an impressive military and had colonized\nmuch of East and Southeast Asia including northeastern China, the Korean peninsula, Taiwan,\nFrench Indochina, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia (see Figure 9.8). In 1941, Japanese\nmilitary forces attacked the US base Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Following the attack, the US declared\nwar on Japan and entered World War II.\nFigure 9.8: Map of the Japanese Empire, 1942 (Derivative work\nfrom original by Shadowxfox, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n3.0) 174 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFollowing Japan\u2019s loss in World War II, the countries of East and Southeast Asia were able to\nacquire independence. Some countries, like the Philippines and Burma, achieved independence\nthrough a peaceful turnover of control, while others such as Indonesia won independence only\nafter a violent period of opposition. The end of World War II reshaped not only the political map\nof East and Southeast Asia but development in the region as well.\n9.4 POLITICAL CONFLICTS AND CHANGES EAST AND SOUTHEAST\nASIA\nThe second half of the 20th century was a time of significant political change for East and\nSoutheastAsia.TheformercoloniesofJapanwereabletobreakawayfromtheircolonialpastand\nbecomeindependent,butasinmanyotherpartsoftheworld,thatindependenceoftencoincided\nwith political conflict.\nFor Japan, the end of World War II brought a period of Westernization and rapid economic\ngrowth. Westernization refers to the process of adopting Western, particularly European and\nAmerican, culture and values. Japan adopted a new constitution and embraced democratic\nprinciples. It continued to industrialize and would become a global leader in electronics and\nautomotive production. Today, Japan has the fourth largest GDP behind only the United States,\nthe European Union, and China.\nInotherpartsofEastandSoutheastAsia,thepoliticalchangestotheregionfollowingWorldWar\nII tended toward communism, a social, political, and economic system that seeks communal\nownership of the means of production. Communism is associated with Marxism, an analysis\nof social class and conflict based on the work of Karl Marx (1818-1883 CE). In a typical society,\nfactories are owned by a wealthy few who then pay workers a lower wage to ensure that they\nmake a profit. In a communist society, however, the goal of Marxism would be a classless society\nwhere everyone shares the ownership and thus receives equal profits.\nMarxist ideas spread to China by the early 20th century and found particular support among\nChinese intellectuals. The Communist Revolution in Russia inspired Marxists in China who\nfoundedacommunistpoliticalpartythatwouldeventuallybeledbyMaoZedong.Thecommunist\nparty continued to gain traction in China and following a civil war, Mao Zedong established the\ncommunist People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. The previous Chinese government fled to the\nislandofTaiwan,whichisofficiallyknownastheRepublicofChinaandclaimscontroloftheentire\nmainland. China, however, maintains that Taiwan is part of China.\nAfter securing political control of China, Mao Zedong sought to transform China\u2019s culture by\nreorientingitaroundtheideologyofcommunism.Oneofthefirststepsinthistransformationwas\ntheGreatLeapForwardfrom1958to1961whichsoughttoreshapeChina\u2019sagrariansocietyinto\nan industrial power. Unfortunately, the changes led to widespread famine and the deaths of tens\nof millions of Chinese as a direct result.\nFollowing the failure of the Great Leap Forward, Mao aimed to eliminate any remaining\ntraditional elements of Chinese culture or capitalist thinking through the Cultural Revolution.\nMillions were imprisoned, forcibly relocated, or tortured, and historical relics and cultural sites\nwere destroyed. After Mao\u2019s death, several leaders responsible for the abuses committed during EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 175\nthe Cultural Revolution were arrested and China began a period of modernization and economic\nreform.\nIn the Korean peninsula, allied forces divided the former Japanese colony along the 38th\nparallel. Russia would control the norther portion, where it helped install a communist\ngovernment and economic system. The United States occupied the southern portion, where it\nassisted apro-Western government initspolitical andeconomic development. Tensions between\nthe two territories led to the Korean War in the early 1950s. Technically, the two sides are still\nat war having never signed a peace agreement and simply agreeing to a cease-fire. Today, North\nKorea, officially the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), follows a Marxist model of\ndevelopment with state owned enterprises and agriculture. The government has been accused\nof numerous human rights violations and the people of North Korea are severely restricted in\nterms of their economic, political, and personal freedom. In South Korea, on the other hand,\nofficially known as the Republic of Korea, a democratic government replaced a series of military\ndictatorships and the country is considered one of the most developed in the region according to\nthe Human Development Index.\nCommunist ideals spread to Southeast Asia, as well, where Marxism influenced the\ngovernments of newly independent countries. In Vietnam, for example, a communist movement\nwasbegunbyHoChiMinhtotrytogainindependencefromFrancefollowingtheendofJapanese\noccupation inWorldWar II. The communist forces were able to defeat the French in a key battle in\n1954andestablishedagovernmentinthenorthernterritory.Thecountrywasthendividedintoa\ncommunistnorthandanti-communistandmajorityCatholicsouth.Thiswasatimeofhightension\nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, and the US feared that the entire region would\neventually come under communist control, essentially creating a Western capitalist hemisphere\nandanEasterncommunisthemisphere.Thefearthatthefallofonecountrytocommunismwould\nleadtothefallofothersurroundingcountriestocommunismwasknownasdominotheory,and\nwasoriginally meantasananecdotebutbecamethebasisforUSforeign policy intheregion (see\nFigure 9.9).\nFigure 9.9: Illustration of Domino Theory (\u00a9 User:Nyenyec, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nTheUnitedStatesaimedtosupportSouthVietnam\u2019sresistancetothecommunistnorth\u2019sgoalof\nunification and began sending military advisors to the region.

To try to combat these tactics, the US military\nsprayedchemicaldefoliantsandherbicides,likeAgentOrange,overVietnam\u2019sforests.Intheend,\nwaning support for the Vietnam War led the US to withdraw and in 1975, Vietnam was unified\nunder communist rule. Over 1 million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans died in the fighting.\nMillions others were exposed to Agent Orange causing health problems and disabilities, and the\nchemical had devastating effects on Vietnam\u2019s ecosystem where it has lingered in the soil.\nDuring the same time period, a communist organization known as the Khmer Rouge, which\nis French for \u201cRed Khmers,\u201d came to power in Cambodia. Khmer refers to the dominant ethnic\ngroup in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge opposed Westernization and US involvement in the newly\nindependent country and believed in a return to an agrarian society.

Large prison camps were set up to house those who\nwere believed to be a threat to communism. Cambodians of other ethnicities or who practiced\nreligion were also executed. In total, more than one million people were killed, often buried\nin mass graves known as the Killing Fields. Cambodia\u2019s attempt to transform into an agrarian\nsociety ultimately led to widespread famine and starvation. In 1978, Vietnamese forces invaded\nCambodia and defeated the Khmer Rouge, but human rights continue to be severely restricted in\nthe country.\nMuch of East and Southeast Asia exhibits characteristics of a shatter belt, an area of political\ninstability that is caught between the interests of competing states. Beginning in the colonial era\nandcontinuing today,Westerninvolvement inthisregionhasattimesledtoindustrialization and\neconomic growth and at other times economic depression and a drive to return to traditional\nvalues. Today, political instability continues to plague several countries in the region.\n9.5 PATTERNS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN EAST AND\nSOUTHEAST ASIA\nDespite the political changes and conflicts that marked the 20th century, the 21st century has\nlargely been marked by economic development across East and Southeast Asia. Economic\ngeography is a branch of geography that explores the spatial aspect of economic development.\nEconomic geographers don\u2019t just ask \u201cWhere is economic development occurring?\u201d but also \u201cWhy\nis economic development occurring in some areas and not others?\u201d In East and Southeast Asia,\neconomic growth has largely resulted from regional and global trade. However, development is\nnot spread evenly across the region and economic inequalities still persist.\nGlobal connections have been the principle driver of economic success in East and Southeast\nAsia. Much of the trade connections have emerged between the countries in this region and\nthe larger Pacific Rim, referring to the countries that border the Pacific Ocean. Many of these\ncountries are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) which promotes free\ntrade across Asia and the Pacific. In Southeast Asia, the countries of the region formed the EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 177\nAssociationofSoutheastAsianNations,orASEAN(seeFigure9.10).Theorganizationaimedto\npromote political security, economic growth, and social development among member countries.\nFigure 9.10: Map of ASEAN Member States (Derivative work from original by ASDFGH, Wikimedia\nCommons, Public Domain)\nIn China and Japan, histories of relative isolation gave way to an embrace of globalization\nand global trade. Although China\u2019s government is communist, it has allowed more free-market\noriented economics in areas known as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs. These SEZs are located\nin coastal China and have special incentives toattractforeign investment (see Figure 9.11). Other\ncapitalistshiftshaveoccurredinChinaevenallowingforUSsupermarketsandrestaurantstoopen\nlocations in the country. These SEZs, as well as other special development areas in China, have\nfunctioned as growth poles, which are areas that have attracted economic development in the\nregion. In 2010, China displaced the United States as the global leader in manufacturing. 178 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 9.11: Map of China\u2019s Special Economic Zones (\u00a9 Alan Mak, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.5)\nBroadly, foreign direct investment (also called FDI), the control of a business in one country\nby a company based in another country, has been a key driver of China\u2019s economic success. In\n2017, China was the second most attractive company for foreign investors, behind the United\nStates,withover$136billioninforeigndirectinvestmentflowingintothecountryaccordingtothe\n2018WorldInvestmentReport.Chinahasdoneitsownforeigndirectinvestingaswell,increasing\noutward flows of FDI from $5.5 billion in 2004 to over $125 billion in 2017, according to the same\nreport.HongKongistheprimarydestinationforChineseforeigndirectinvestment,butsubstantial\nsumsalsoflowtocountriesinAfricaaswellasAustralia,whereChinaisthelargesttradingpartner.\nWithinSoutheastAsia,ChinaisnowthetopinvestorinMyanmarandhasincreasedforeigndirect\ninvestment in Singapore.\nWhile China and Japan remain the largest economies in the region, other areas have\nexperiencedhighratesofeconomicgrowth.TheFourAsianTigers,inparticular,referringtoHong\nKong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, experienced rapid industrialization and economic\ndevelopmentledbyexport-driveneconomies,lowtaxes,andfreetrade.Somehavealsotheorized\nthat the Confucian work ethic present in these countries complemented the process of\nindustrialization. Each country also developed a distinct specialty and maintains a competitive EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 179\nadvantage in that area. South Korea, for example, is known for its manufacturing of information\ntechnology while Hong Kong is a leading financial center.\nMuch of the economic growth of the Asian Tigers as well as Japan has come from the export of\nvalueadded goods.Whencountries exportrawmaterials, theireconomicbenefitislimited since\nthose raw materials are often not inherently valuable. When these raw materials are made into\nsomethinguseful,however,valueisaddedandtheproductcanbesoldforahigherprofit.Lumber\nis quite cheap, for example. When the lumber is made into a dining table, it has a much higher\nvalue. Many companies located in these countries have become household names in electronics,\ncomputing, and the auto industry. China has traditionally exported relatively low value added\ngoods, but in 2016, the Chinese government announced a shift to higher value added products\nlike transportation technology and telecommunications.\nSoutheast Asia has benefitted from its key geographical position as the eennttrreepp\u00f4\u00f4tt, a French term\nmeaningacommercialcenteroftrade,fortherestofAsia.TheStraitofMalaccainparticularisthe\nmain shipping channel between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean and a key transportation\ngateway (see Figure 9.12). Around one quarter of all the world\u2019s exported goods travels through\nthe strait each year. Malaysia\u2019s economic success as an entrep\u00f4t is exemplified by its Petronas\nTowers in Kuala Lumpur, which were the tallest buildings in the world from 1998 to 2004.\nIndonesiahasthelargesteconomyofSoutheastAsia,exportingprimarilytoJapan,Singapore,the\nUnited States, and China. Singapore has the highest GDP per capita in the region, again owing to\nits key geographical position.\nFigure 9.12: Map of the Strait of Malacca (U.S. Department of Defense, Public Domain) 180 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nOne lingering issue in many of these countries has been crony capitalism, the notion that the\nsuccess of a business depends on its relationship to other businesses and the state. A politician\nmight have an old friend in the manufacturing industry, for example, and give the friend a\ngovernment contract with beneficial terms. In 1997, a financial crisis that started in Thailand\nspread throughout the Southeast Asia region and to South Korea was, in part, blamed on the\nbusiness dealings of corrupt politicians. Several countries in this region rank high on an index\nof corruption perception, as shown in Figure 9.13, and some have expressed concern that the\ncommunist countries of this region will continue to embrace capitalism when it is politically\nbeneficial rather than as part of a broader and more transparent economic system.\nFigure 9.13: Map of Index of Perception of Corruption by Transparency International, 2017 (\u00a9 Transparency\nInternational, CC-BY-4.0-DE) EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 181\nEconomic development is not spread evenly throughout the region. By most estimates, North\nKorearemainsthepoorestcountryintheregionwithanestimatedGDPpercapitaofjust$1,300in\n2016.MainlandSoutheastAsia,withtheexceptionofThailand,remainsrelativelypoor.Cambodia,\nLaos, Myanmar, and Vietnam all have GDP per capitas of less than $8,000 as of 2018 and remain\nfar less well off than their more developed neighbors in the region.\nWhere economic growth has occurred, it is often confined to an urban area which can drive\nup population densities as people move to the city in search of work. In Indonesia, the island\nof Java is very densely populated while other surrounding islands are relatively sparse. The\nDutch colonizers and later the Indonesian government, in a stated effort to reduce poverty and\novercrowding, created a policy of transmigration seeking to relocate people to the less densely\npopulatedislands.Thisprogramhasbeencontroversial,however,andtheindigenouspeoplewho\ninhabit the surrounding islands see the program as a threat to their way of life.\nIn some cases, uneven distribution of economic development has led to both interregional and\nintraregional migration as people move in search of economic advancement. China in particular\nhas seen a significant amount of rural to urban migration. Around 11 percent of the entire\ncountry\u2019s population migrated from rural to urban areas in 2009 and most of them are young\nadults.ManyofChina\u2019smigrantsarepartofafloatingpopulation,whichreferstomembersofa\npopulation who reside in an area for a period of time but do not live there permanently. Around\n50 million Chinese reside overseas, mostly in Southeast Asia. Thailand has the largest population\nof overseas Chinese, and Chinese also represent the majority ethnic group in Singapore. Long\nbefore colonization, East and Southeast Asia was a realm of global economic influence, from\nthe Chinese empire to the trade routes of Southeast Asia. As some countries of the realm have\nmovedtowardpoliticalstabilityandeconomicgrowth,othershaveremainedinastateofpolitical\nand economic turmoil. Tourism could bring some of these countries an economic boost, but the\nprospectoftourismincountrieswithgovernmentinstabilityislimited.Still,althoughcountrieslike\nLaos, Myanmar, and Cambodia currently have some of the world\u2019s smallest economies, they are\nsome of the fastest growing in the world and improvements in agricultural and natural resource\ndevelopment combined with a stable political infrastructure could expand the economic strength\nof the region.

However, the ecosystem of the Outback is quite fragile. With limited\nprecipitation and vegetation, overgrazing puts the region at risk for desertification. In addition,\nalthough this region was the center of population for Australia\u2019s indigenous groups, ranching in\nthe Outback has created issues of land ownership. 184 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 10.2: View of Australian Outback and Mount Conner (\u00a9 Gabriele Delhey, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n3.0)\nOne of the most well-known features of Australia\u2019s geography lies just off coast: the Great\nBarrier Reef. This massive underwater reef is the world\u2019s largest coral structure and stretches\nover 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles). However, warming ocean temperatures and pollution have\nbeen a significant environmental threat to the Great Barrier Reef in recent years.\nUnlike its geologically stable neighbor, New Zealand is situated at the intersection of the Pacific\nPlateandtheAustralianPlate(seeFigure10.3).Itstwolarge,mountainousislandsandnumerous\nsmall islands are prone to both earthquakes and volcanoes.

OCEANIA 185\nFigure 10.3: Map of the Tectonic Plates of Oceania (United States Geological\nSurvey, Public Domain)\nThe islands of the Pacific to the north and east of Australia and New Zealand are divided\ninto three regions (see Figure 10.4). New Zealand is part of the islands of Polynesia, from the\nprefix \u201cpoly\u201d meaning \u201cmany.\u201d Polynesia is a large, triangular region stretching from New Zealand\nto Easter Island to the Hawaiian and Midway Islands. West of Polynesia and to the northeast\nof Australia are the islands of Melanesia, including New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji.\nEuropeans called the region \u201cMelanesia\u201d from the Greek prefix melan- meaning \u201cblack,\u201d referring\ntothedarkerskintheybelievedcharacterizedthepeopleofthisrealm.NorthofMelanesiaarethe\ntiny islands of Micronesia, from the prefix \u201cmicro\u201d meaning \u201csmall.\u201d There are over 2,000 islands\nin Micronesia. 186 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 10.4: Map of Australia and the Pacific (Map by User:Kahuroa, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nTheislandsofthePacificcanbedividedintotwogroupsbasedontheirphysicalcharacteristics.\nThe high islands like Hawaii are volcanic, meaning they were formed from volcanoes, and thus\nhave a relatively high relief. This high relief and volcanic soils enables the high islands to have\nfertile soil and ample rainfall, which in turn supports a diverse agricultural system and relatively\nlarge populations.\nIn contrast, the low islands of the Pacific are comprised mostly of coral and, as their name\nimplies,aregenerallylowinelevation.MostoftheislandsinthePacific,particularlyinMicronesia,\nare low islands. These islands may only rise a few feet above the water and their dry, sandy soil\nmakes farming difficult. Fresh water is often in short supply in the low islands. As a result, these\nislands typically have much smaller populations. The relatively large coral island that comprises\nthe country of Niue, for example, rises to a maximum 60 meters (less than 200 feet). The low\nelevation of these islands make them vulnerable to natural disasters, such as tropical cyclones,\nand to changes in sea elevation due to rising global temperatures. In the country of Tuvalu, an\nislandchainlocatedbetweenHawaiiandAustralia,thehighestpointisamere4.6meters(15feet)\nabove sea level and the island has sustained severe damage from cyclones during its history.\nA number of low islands of in the Pacific form atolls, ring-shaped chains of coral islands\nsurrounding a central lagoon (see Figure 10.5).

OCEANIA 187\nFigure 10.5: Satellite Photo of the Atafu Atoll in Tokelau (NASA Johnson Space Center, Public Domain)\nIn general, the islands of the Pacific have warm, tropical climates with little seasonal extremes\nin temperature. Some islands experience seasonal, primarily orographic rainfall. These relatively\nwarm temperatures help support tourism throughout the region. Throughout New Zealand and\nthe core area of Australia, east of the Great Dividing Range, is primarily a maritime climate.

Historically, the world\u2019s oceans were considered the \u201chigh seas\u201d and while states had 188 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\ncontrolovertheirimmediatecoastlineextendingoutthreemiles,thevaststretcheshighseaswere\nfree from ownership. As ocean resources became more important, however, countries became\ninterested in establishing clear rights to minerals, oil, and fishing stocks offshore.\nIn 1945, President Harry S. Truman announced that the sovereign territory of the United\nStates extended to the boundary of its continental shelf, which was in some places hundreds of\nmiles offshore. Other countries, including Chile, Peru, and Ecuador, followed suit, beginning an\ninternationaldashtoclaimoffshorewaters.Withintwodecades,countrieswereusingavarietyof\nsystemsofownership;someclaimedwatersthreemilesoffshore,others12miles,andstillothers\nmaintained ownership over all of the waters to the continental shelf.\nEventually, the United Nations intervened, seeking a universal system of ocean ownership. The\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) resulted from series of international\nconferencesandestablishedguidelinesformaritimetravelandcontrolofnaturalresourcesfound\nin the world\u2019s seas. As a result of the UNCLOS, there are now several categories of ownership\nover the world\u2019s water depending on its distance from shore (see Figure 10.6). A state\u2019s internal\nwaters are considered the sovereign territory of a state. Territorial waters extended 12 miles\noffshore and are also considered sovereign territory of a state. However, in territorial waters, a\nstate must grant \u201cinnocent passage\u201d to oceangoing vessels, meaning it must allow the vessel to\npass through as long as it is doing so in a speedy manner that is not threatening the security of\na state. Beyond the territorial waters, a state can control certain aspects of a 12 mile contiguous\nzone,includingtaxationandpollution.FollowingtheUSclaimofcontroloverthecontinentalshelf,\nthe UNCLOS established that a 200 mile zone extending out from a country\u2019s coastline was its\nexclusive economic zone, or EEZ, where it has exclusive control over any natural resources.\nOther countries can fly over or pass through the waters of the EEZ, but cannot use the resources\nwithin. However, countries are free to sell, lease, or share the rights to their EEZ. Beyond the EEZ\nare international waters where no state has direct control. OCEANIA 189\nFigure 10.6: International Sea Rights Established by\nthe UNCLOS (\u00a9 historicair, Wikimedia Commons,\nCC BY-SA 3.0)\nAs a result of the UNCLOS, some tiny islands gained immense stretches of ocean territory \u2013\nandtherightstotheresourcesinandunderneaththosewaters(seeFigure10.7).Somecountries\nfound this as an opportunity to expand their resource area. Conflicts developed over what would\notherwise be tiny specks of island territory but what had become over 100,000 nautical miles of\nocean resources. Particularly as the technology for offshore drilling improved, states sought to\nsecure control of what could be huge caches of oil and minerals. 190 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nFigure 10.7: Map of International Waters (\u00a9 Kvasir, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThe UNCLOS also established some ownership over the Arctic Ocean. Russia, Norway, Canada,\nthe United States, and Denmark, which controls Greenland, all have overlapping EEZs in the\nArctic. Historically, this frigid, isolated region was of little interest to countries. Early attempts at\nexploration were largely unsuccessful and a person wouldn\u2019t reach the North Pole until the early\n20th century.

The answer depends on who you ask.\nSeveral different countries claim control of Antarctic territories (see Figure 10.8) but, in general,\nthese states do not recognize each other\u2019s claims. OCEANIA 191\nFigure 10.8: Map of Research Stations and Antarctic Territorial Claims (CIA World Factbook, Public\nDomain)\nIn 1959, the Antarctic Treaty was signed that put a hold on new territorial claims, established\nAntarctica as a zone for scientific research and environmental protection, and prohibited military 192 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nactivity in the region. A later treaty signed in 1998 reaffirmed Antarctica as a peaceful, scientific\nfrontier and prohibited mining on the continent.\n10.3 BIOGEOGRAPHY IN AUSTRALIA AND THE PACIFIC\nThe relative isolation of Oceania defines it as a region but has also contributed to perhaps\nits quirkiest characteristic: its distinctive wildlife. Biogeography is a branch of geography that\nexploresthespatialdistributionoftheworld\u2019sflora(plantlife)andfauna(animallife).Whileevery\nworld region has its own, unique plants and animals, some of the creatures found in Australia\nand the Pacific are found nowhere else on Earth. A number of world regions have an impressive\ndegree of biodiversity, meaning there are a wide variety of species present. These regions are\ngenerallylocatedinthetropics.BritishbiogeographerAlfredRusselWallacewasoneofthefirstto\ntry and determine the boundary of Australia and Southeast Asia\u2019s unique plants and animals\nin the 19th century.\nGeography is more than the where, however, but is also a discipline that asks \u201cWhy?\u201d Why\ndoes Australia have such unique, and frankly a bit frightening at times, flora and fauna? Why\nare monotremes, mammals that lay eggs rather than give birth to live young, only found in\nthe isolated region of Australia and New Guinea? It is the isolation of this region that\u2019s key. 200\nmillion years ago, Australia was situated on the far-reaches of Pangaea, the last supercontinent\n(see Figure 10.9). Around 175 million years ago, Pangaea began to break apart. During the same\ntimeperiod,theearliestmammalswereevolving,divergingfirstfromegg-layingreptilesandthen\ncontinuing to adapt and change. Early egg-laying monotremes were found throughout Pangaea\nbut eventually went extinct in the other world regions, out-competed by more evolutionarily\nadvanced mammals. Australia and New Guinea, however, broke away before more advanced\nmammals arrived, and thus monotremes remained. The only modern monotremes are the\nplatypus and the echidna. OCEANIA 193\nFigure 10.9: Map of Pangaea with Modern Continental Outlines (\u00a9\nUser:Kieff, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nIn addition to monotremes, Australia is home to the world\u2019s largest and most diverse array of\nmarsupials, mammals who carry their young in a pouch. A number of marsupials are also found\nin Central and South America and just one species lives in North America: the Virginia opossum,\nmoretypicallyreferredtoasa\u201cpossum.\u201dInOceania,well-knownmarsupialsincludethekangaroo,\nkoala, wombat, and the Tasmanian devil. The Kangaroo in particular is a widely used symbol of\nAustralia and kangaroo meat, though controversial, can be found throughout Australia.\nAustralia is not just home tocuddly marsupials like koalas, wallabies, and quokkas, though. It is\nalso home to some of the world\u2019s deadliest creatures. There are more deadly snakes in Australia\nthan in any other country in the world including the taipan, considered by some to be the world\u2019s\nmost venomous. An episode of the children\u2019s television show \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d was actually banned in\nAustraliabecauseitfeatureda\u201cfriendlyspider\u201dandlocalofficialsbelieveditwouldsendthewrong\nmessagetoAustralianchildreninacountrywherespiderscanbedeadly.Offshore,Australia\u2019sbox\njellyfish can kill simply by the pain inflicted by its sting which can send the body into shock.\nAnother key area of biodiversity is New Zealand, particularly in terms of its flora. Its isolation\nallowed for species of trees that have remained relatively unchanged for the past 190 million\nyears. Several species of birds in New Zealand, such as the moas, went extinct due to hunting\nshortly after humans first arrived in the region. Few mammals existed in New Zealand before\nhuman settlement and the arrival of the first mammals here, such as rats and weasels, led to 194 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nwidespread extinctions of native species that had never had to evolve to compete with these\npredators. Rabbits in particular proved to be a particularly troublesome invasive species, which\nreferstoaspeciesofplant,animal,orfungusthatisnotnativetoanareabutspreadsrapidly.Early\nsettlers to New Zealand brought rabbits for fur and meat, but the high reproductive capacity of\nrabbitsquicklyprovedtroublesomeandbythe1880s,rabbitswerehavingaconsiderablenegative\neffect on agriculture.

Unfortunately, these species proved devastating to local\nbirdspeciesandhadonlyminimalimpactontheincreasingrabbitpopulation.Catsweresimilarly\nintroduced, but they too caused the extinction of several bird species and a native bat. (The\nchildren\u2019s story about the old lady who swallowed the fly comes to mind.) These species are still\nseen as some of the biggest threats to New Zealand\u2019s wildlife.\n10.4 THE PATTERNS OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT IN AUSTRALIA AND\nTHE PACIFIC\nMuch of the physical landscape of Oceania has been directly shaped by human activity and\nsettlement.AlthoughAustraliatodayisknownforitsoriginasaBritishprisoncolony,thecontinent\nwas inhabited long before Europeans arrived. The indigenous people of Australia are known\nas Aborigines and comprise a number of different ethnolinguistic and cultural groups. Most\nresearchers believe the first aboriginal groups arrived in Australia between 40,000 and 50,000\nyears ago when sea levels were lower and land bridges and relatively short sea crossings\nseparated Australia, Tasmania, and Papua New Guinea from mainland Southeast Asia.\nIttookthousands moreyearsandadvances inoceantransportation andnavigation fortherest\nof the Pacific islands to be settled (see Figure 10.10). Humans gradually made their way to the\nislandsofMelanesia,toFijiby900BCEtheneastandnorth.Thefar-reachesofPolynesia,including\nHawaiiandEasterIsland,werenotpopulateduntilmuchlaterduetothelongdistancesseparating\nthemfromotherlandmasses.NewZealand,though,wasoneofthelasttobesettled,withEastern\nPolynesians not arriving on the islands until around 1250 CE. These groups developed their own\nethnic and cultural identity known as theMaori. OCEANIA 195\nFigure 10.10: Map of Human Migrations Across the Pacific Islands (\u00a9 David Eccles, Wikimedia Commons,\nCC BY 4.0)\nLife would change dramatically for the people of Oceania with the arrival of Europeans. The\nDutch first made landfall in Australia in 1606 CE but simply explored and mapped the area\nand did not establish a settlement. In the late 18th century, the British established their first\nAustraliansettlementinwhatwouldlaterbecomethecityofSydneywiththeintentionofcreating\nan overseas penal colony. However, many of the prisoners sent to Australia were not hardened\ncriminals who needed to be separated from the British Isles by an expansive ocean. Many were\naccused of petty crimes like theft and even children who had committed crimes were shipped\nto Australia. Today, around 20 percent of Australians are the descendants of these imprisoned\nsettlers.\nEuropean settlement of Australia challenged aboriginal land and water resources, but it was\ndisease that had the most devastating effect on the indigenous population. At the time of British 196 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\ncolonization, there were likely between 315,000 and 750,000 Aborigines in Australia. By the start\nof World War II, diseases like smallpox and measles reduced their numbers to just 74,000.\nNew Zealand was originally claimed by the British as a colony of Australia, but then became its\nown colony in the mid-19th century. Around the same time, representatives of Britain as well as\nMaori leaders signed theTreatyofWaitangi. Thistreatygranted British colonists sovereignty over\nthegoverningofNewZealandbutgavetheMaoritherightstotheirtriballandsandresourcesand\nmade them British subjects.\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, European and Japanese colonial expeditions claimed\nmost of the Pacific islands. Some islands were seen as strategic military bases. Others, such\nas France\u2019s colony of New Caledonia, were transformed into overseas prison colonies following\nthe British model. Still others were occupied for their resources and trade opportunities. In the\ndecades following World War II, a number of islands achieved independence. Australia slowly\nincreaseditsautonomythroughouttheearly20thcentury,officiallydissolvingfromBritishcontrol\nin1942.NewZealandgainedindependencefromBritainin1947.Inthe1970sand1980s,another\nwave of independence occurred, with Fiji, Tonga, and a number of other states gaining\nindependence.\nOthers were not granted independence and a number of Pacific islands remain colonies today.\nHawaiiwasmadeaUSstatein1959largelyagainstthewishesofitsindigenouspopulation.Guam\nbecame a strategic US Naval base in the Spanish-American War and later in World War II and\nremains a US territory today. Its residents are US citizens but cannot vote in elections. The vast\nmajority of the world\u2019s remaining colonies today are islands because of their strategic locations\nand resource potential, particularly after the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n(seeFigure 10.11).\nFigure 10.11: Map of Non-Self-Governing Territories, 2012 (Derived from UN Map of Non-Self Governing Territories,\nWikimedia Commons, Public Domain) OCEANIA 197\nAlthough Australia and New Zealand gained independence relatively early compared to many\nof the other areas of Oceania, these countries have experienced lingering issues related to their\nindigenouspopulations.ForAustralianAboriginals,thereweretwohistoricalissuestheysoughtto\naddress: the government admission of mistreatment and ownership over tribal lands. Previously,\ntheAustraliangovernmentruledthatAustraliapriortoBritisharrivalwasconsideredterranullius,\nornobody\u2019sland,andthustherewasnoregardforindigenousrightstolandorresources.In1992,\nhowever,Australia\u2019shighcourtruledthatlandpolicywasinvalid.Bythistime,Australia\u2019sNorthern\nTerritory was already considered aboriginal land, but later courts found that over three-quarters\nof the land in Australia could be subject to aboriginal claims, even though Aborigines comprised\nonly 3 percent of the population of Australia. In 2008, the prime minister of Australia issued a\nformal apology to the Aboriginal people of Australia on behalf of the government.\nOne challenge to these perhaps promising legal developments, however, is that private\nenterprise is prohibited on aboriginal land. Even building a home is seen as a violation of the\ncurrent guidelines. Thus, many Aborigines became land-rich as a result of the government\u2019s\ndecision, but still remained poor. Unemployment, alcohol abuse, food security, and land reform\ncontinue to be significant issues for Australian Aborigines. Today, there are over 500,000\nAboriginal Australians and almost one-third now live in Australia\u2019s major cities.\nTheMaoriofNewZealandmakeupamuchlargerportionofthecountry\u2019spopulationataround\n15 percent. The Maori have generally kept their traditional cultural and linguistic traditions while\npartially integrating into more western New Zealand society. Compared to other groups in New\nZealand, the Maori have lower life expectancies and average incomes, and make up around 50\npercent of New Zealand\u2019s prison population.\nEconomically, Australia and the Pacific islands have struggled with what could be called the\n\u201ctyrannyofdistance,\u201dthefactthatthisregionremainssofarandsoisolatedfromtheotherworld\nregions. Most of the economies of these countries are based on exports, but these exports must\nbe shipped, adding on to the cost of production. Anything that is not made locally must also be\nshipped in and some countries have promoted import-substitution industries, a strategy to\nreplace foreign imports with domestic production of goods. Australia remains relatively unique\namong more developed countries in that its economy is based heavily on the export of\ncommodities. Geography plays a key role in Australia\u2019s export-oriented economy. The country\nis relatively large and has a significant amount of natural resources. Its domestic population\ncompared to its size and resource base is quite small, at only 24.6 million people as of 2017, so\nit is able to export the resources it doesn\u2019t need domestically. The country is the global leader in\ncoal exports and has the second-largest diamond mine in the world.\nAcross the smaller islands of the Pacific, geography has also played a key role in economic\ndevelopment. These countries are often very small with only limited natural resources. They are\nalsoremote,onlyconnectedbylongshippingroutestootherworldregions.Manyrelyontradeto\nAustralia,NewZealand,China,Japan,andtheUnitedStatesforbothexportincomeandimported\ngoods. Often, residents of the Pacific islands speak Pidgin English, a simplified form of English\nused by speakers of different languages for trade, in addition to their native tongue. Tourism has\nbecome a significant source of income for some countries of the Pacific, especially for the islands\nof Fiji. Despite some economic successes, these are also some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable\ncountries in terms of global changes in climate and the coming decades could see significant\nchanges in the human landscape as a result. 198 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\n10.5 THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF OCEANIA\nThe human settlement of Oceania, from the earliest migrations to European colonization, has\nreshaped the physical landscape of this region. Environmental degradation, disturbances to\nresources like air, land, and water, is a serious concern as economic growth often comes at the\nexpense of environmental sustainability. In Australia, for example, wide stretches of previously\nsparsely inhabited Outback have become grazing lands. In Papua New Guinea illegal logging has\ncontributed to significant deforestation. Pollution from dairying in New Zealand has led to high\nlevels of water pollution.\nInvasive species have also had significant environmental impacts in a region that has been\notherwise relatively isolated. Australia has strict quarantine laws in an attempt to limit damage\nfrom nonnative plants and animals. The country currently spends around $4 billion yearly in\ninvasive weed management alone. Cats have been banned in parts of New Zealand where they\npose a threat to local bird species. Rats brought by early European ships have presented a\nsignificant problem for many islands of the Pacific where they kill other plants and animals\nand also spread disease. Offshore, invasive fish and algae species have damaged fragile ocean\necosystems.\nIn addition to local pollution concerns, human settlement of other world regions has\ncontributed to pollution in the Pacific Ocean. Worldwide, there are five main ocean gyres, large\nsystemsofrotatingoceancurrents(seeFigure10.12).InthenorthernPacificOcean,onegyrehas\nvery high concentrations of trash and plastics carried to the area by ocean currents. It has been\ntermed the Great Pacific garbage patch. When you throw something \u201caway\u201d improperly, these\ngyres are really where \u201caway\u201d is. A water bottle improperly disposed of on the western coast of\nNorth America will make its way to the Great Pacific garbage patch in around six years.\nFigure 10.12: Ocean Gyres and Currents (Derivative work from original by Ingwik, Public Domain) OCEANIA 199\nOne issue with plastics is that they don\u2019t biodegrade, and instead keep breaking down into\nsmaller pieces while still remaining plastic. Fish and other marine life eat these tiny bits of plastic,\nwhich can disrupt a number of biological systems. Some of these fish species are then consumed\nby humans. Because the Great Pacific garbage patch contains such small pieces of plastic, and\nmostoftheplasticisbelowthesurfaceoftheocean,itisnoteasilyvisiblewiththenakedeyeand\nit is difficult to estimate its size. Some have theorized the patch is as big as or bigger than the US\nstateofTexas,whileothersnotethattheideaofa\u201cpatch\u201dofgarbageisreallyamisnomerasthere\nare concentrations of trash throughout the world\u2019s oceans.\nTrash from other world regions also washes up along the shores of the Pacific islands. Kamilo\nBeach in Hawaii is the site of a significant amount of plastic that has washed ashore from the\nGreat Pacific garbage patch, so much so that the area has been nicknamed \u201cPlastic Beach\u201d (see\nFigure 10.13). Though the shoreline looks sandy, 90 percent of it is actually bits of plastic and\nyou would have to dig down at least one foot to reach grains of sand. Plastic trash litters many of\nthe shorelines of the Pacific islands presenting a hazard for marine life and a management and\ncleanup challenge since debris often comes from thousands of miles away.\nFigure 10.13: Plastic Debris on Kamilo Beach, Hawaii (Algalita.org, Public Domain)\nIt is changes in global climate, however, that pose the most severe environmental threat to\nOceania. For many of the world\u2019s regions, changes in climate are viewed as hypothetical.\nHurricanes might increase in intensity. The risk of fire might increase. Changes in bird migrations\nin Europe and North America to shifts in global fish stocks have already been linked to increases\nin global temperature but with little direct effect on the human populations of these regions. In 200 CAITLIN FINLAYSON\nOceania, though, small increases in temperature and ocean levels could have disastrous effects\non already fragile ecosystems and economies.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is currently experiencing periods of coral bleaching due to increasing\nocean temperatures. When waters get too warm, coral experience \u201cstress\u201d and expel the colorful,\nalgae-like organisms that live within them. Mass coral bleaching has occurred several times since\nthe late 1990s and is expected to become a regular occurrence as ocean temperatures continue\nto rise. Coral bleaching has also been documented in other reefs including ones in Hawaii.\nSomeoftheleadersofthePacificislandshavebeenamongthemostvocalchampionsforglobal\nclimateregulations.Speakingin2015,theprimeministerofFiji,FrankBainimaramadidnotmince\nwords: \u201cUnless the world acts decisively in the coming weeks to begin addressing the greatest\nchallenge of our age, then the Pacific, as we know it, is doomed.\u201d Fiji has already experienced an\nincreaseininfectiousdiseasesrelatedtohighertemperatures,record-breakinghightides,andhas\nhad to relocate citizens due to rising ocean levels.\nManyoftheeffectsofwarmingtemperaturesinthePacificrelatetochangesthatarefirstbeing\ndocumented in the Arctic.
