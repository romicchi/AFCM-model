Davis, Emporia State University\nResearch is a mental groping by starlight\ntowards the daylight of clearer vision.\nIt begins in the slow laborious search for facts in a narrow field.\nAs material accumulates, relations appear.\nThe mass ferments, and finally organizes itself\ninto the semblance of a new living idea.\n--Harry Kirke Wolfe, May 29, 1918\nHarry Kirke Wolfe founded his teaching career in psychology on the principle that the training of the\nmind would be served best by actively involving his students in psychological research. The consummate\nteacher, Wolfe clearly understood the interrelation between teaching and research, an emphasis we\nappreciatively emulate in this volume. It is the preparation of those individuals who choose the\nrewarding path of careers in psychological research (and those who will be teaching them) that we had\nin mind when we conceived the idea for this book. Therefore, we thought it would be helpful to bring\ntogether researchers of distinction to discuss the origin, development, and implementation of their own\nresearch ideas in the context of the current status of research in their specialized fields. The stories of\ntheir professional lives amply illustrate the process Wolfe described in the opening quotation.\nOur primary audience for The Many Faces of Psychological Research in the 21st Century is the\npsychology student who is considering a career in research. Although both undergraduates and\ngraduates should find this book quite valuable as a course text or a reference work, we think the book's\nmost important value will be to serve as a source of inspiration and guidance in becoming involved in\nthe research process. We carefully selected our chapter authors based on their current contributions to,\nand knowledge of, their respective specialty areas and their acknowledged expertise as teachers. The\nteacher-researcher combination resulted in chapters that we think are very readable and representative\nof contemporary research. As students strive to identify where their own potential can be expressed to\nmaximum impact, we think this volume can assist in refining their choices, concentrating their energies,\nand enriching their repertoire of research strategies. The chapter authors not only offer advice and\ninspiration about specific fields of research within psychology, but they also serve as inspiring models in\ntheir own right for the contributions they have made to understanding behavior.\nThis book serves other secondary audiences as well. Our chapter authors provide a substantial resource\nfor current, lecture-enhancing material for teachers of introductory psychology, who want their courses\nto reflect cutting-edge research. Although it is easy to envision this book becoming a staple in the\nteaching resources of graduate teaching assistants and neophyte faculty, teachers at all levels of\nexperience can use this text to make their aging lecture notes more contemporary. As psychology\ncontinues to fragment and splinter, the need to acquire a general overview of the field becomes\napparent; this book serves that function. Professionals who want to achieve an overview of research in\nthe various areas of their discipline can also benefit from the researchers' stories. 2\nHarry Kirke Wolfe's wisdom about the nature of science faithfully captures the excitement of the\nchallenge of research in psychology. Our chapter authors have exhibited this willingness to grapple with\nmystery, careful observation skills, patience and discipline, creativity, and the insight to recognize a\nsound conclusion when it ultimately emerges from the chaos. Despite the difference in their areas of\nspecialization, their common struggles to understand human behavior emerge from a complex evolution\nof psychological research.\nA Brief History of Research in Psychology\nHistorians routinely point to 1879 as the birth of scientific psychology when Wilhelm Wundt began\nconducting original scientific research on mental processes in Leipzig, Germany (Goodwin, 1999; Schultz\n& Schultz, 1996). Wundt and his first American student, James McKeen Cattell, purposefully emulated\nthe established natural sciences in their research practices, a pattern that was enthusiastically adopted\nby the early structural psychologists. However, not everyone understood why adherence to scientific\nmethods was such an important aspect of the emerging science of psychology. Wolfe, Wundt's second\nAmerican student to receive a PhD in psychology, attempted to clarify the intentions of psychology\nresearchers and the nature of psychological research in a description that he wrote to the Nebraska\nBoard of Regents in 1891. He acknowledged that psychology was having difficulty gaining recognition as\na science. He drew attention to the essential role of experimentation in helping to establish psychology\nas equivalent to any other branch of experimental science. He suggested,\nThe measurement of the Quality, Quantity, and Time Relations of mental states\nis as inspiring and as good discipline as the determination of, say the percent\nof sugar in a beet or the variation of an electric current. The exact determination\nof mental processes ought to be as good mental discipline as the exact determination\nprocess taking place in matter.\n(Benjamin, 1991, p. 43)\nWolfe committed his own research energies to exploring mental processes as psychology in America\ncontinued to define its boundaries and its practices. Psychologists were not content to devote\nthemselves solely to human mental processes. There were new and different worlds to conquer.\nReports of animal research began to appear in the literature. In 1901, W. S. Small published the initial\nreport of rat maze learning and Norman Triplett described the development of learned helplessness in\nperch. Within a few decades, the study of animal learning and behavior would become an integral\ncomponent of the field of psychology, spearheaded by behaviorists Clark Hull, E. C. Tolman, Edwin R.\nGuthrie, Kenneth Spence, and B. F. Skinner.\nThe lure of applying psychology to practical human problems began to capture the imagination of other\npsychologists whose concerns were decidedly pragmatic. Lightner Witmer established the first\npsychological clinic in Philadelphia in 1896, ushering into being the largest specialty area in psychology, a\nspecialization that continues to flourish. The pioneering work of Walter Dill Scott and Hugo Munsterberg\nin the early 1900s established the new specialty of industrial/organizational psychology. The\ndevelopment of the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests during World War I created a different kind of\nbeachhead for psychology. The success of those assessment tools created many new opportunities for\napplying psychology to real world problems.\nThe Contemporary Landscape of Psychological Research\nSubsequent decades have witnessed an explosion of specialized research interests in psychology. The\nAmerican Psychological Association identified through its divisional affiliation structure at least 50 3\nresearch communities devoted to unlocking the mysteries that remain unsolved in their chosen areas of\ninquiry. These areas include such broad-ranging specialties as military psychology, peace psychology,\npediatric psychology, psychology and law, teaching of psychology, experimental analysis of behavior,\nand community psychology, among others.\nIt isn't just the topic areas that have changed and broadened since Wolfe's passionate defense of\npsychology as legitimate science. Research technology has undergone impressive changes. Puzzle boxes\nand brass instruments gave way to electromechanical relay racks, which, in turn, were replaced by a\ndazzling array of computers and computer-related devices used to create experimental conditions and\nrecord responses. The advent of electronic databases for psychological research facilitated faster and\nmore efficient literature reviews contributing to the exponential growth of research across specialized\ndiscipline areas and, ironically, compounding the problem of \"staying current\" in one's own burgeoning\nresearch area. At the outset of a new century, we are likely to continue to see changes in technology\nthat will compound the advantages and increase the hazards.\nIn a more literal sense, the \"faces\" of psychologists have also changed. Many textbooks have written\nextensively about scientific psychology as a white, male enterprise. Thanks to the splendid scholarship of\nhistorians, such as Laurel Furumoto and Elizabeth Scarborough, psychology has rediscovered the\ninvaluable contributions of psychology's \"foremothers.\" The research contributions of pioneering\nwomen, such as Mary Calkins and Christine Ladd-Franklin, provide exciting information not just about\nresearch on human behavior but about how human behavior among psychologists influenced the\ndefinition and evolution about how people gain acceptance as full-fledged members of the larger\nresearch community. Similar issues have challenged other minority constituents of psychology in the\nwake of the pioneering contributions by individuals such as Mamie and Kenneth Clark.\nAt the threshold of a new century, we recognize that the composition of faces of those persons who will\nbe our future researchers is also shifting. The majority of students at the undergraduate and graduate\nlevels of education are women. As attracted as women have become to the science and practice of\npsychology, we still have much work to do in helping psychology attract and retain ethnic minority\nresearchers and practitioners.\nWe have also witnessed during the last decade some major changes and challenges to the values and\nethical practices involved in research. Our growing expertise about the frailties of human observers led\nto a challenge related to the practice and value of objectivity. Captive in our own cultural constraints, we\nrecognize the ease with which biases can filter even the most careful observations and research designs.\nSome researchers have begun to mount forceful arguments for revisiting the value of qualitative forms\nof research.\nMost important, psychology has embraced the absolute necessity of enacting ethical safeguards for the\nprotection of research participants. In psychology's earlier zeal for finding answers to behavioral\nquestions, our community has enacted suspect, and in some instances, probably harmful actions to\nthose we were trying to help with our research. Our widely-adopted institutional review practices have\nhelped us choose a wiser and more humane path for answering the many mysteries that remain.\nWith the enterprise of scientific psychology continually expanding, it becomes increasingly challenging\nto identify where and how one should invest research energies. We asked for help from individuals who\nhave carved out significant roles in various areas of research in psychology and typified the kind of spirit\nHarry Kirke Wolfe so eloquently described in the quote we used at the opening of this chapter. Each has 4\na distinctive story to tell that explains their individual journeys in developing their distinctive niches in\ncontemporary research.\nJoining in the Research Enterprise\nBeginning psychology students often seem mystified by the process of research. Students struggle to\nlearn the rudiments of research processes from articulating an original idea through an elegant analysis\nof a sound research design. Neophyte researchers sometimes fret that the supply of good research\nopportunities may be exhausted before they get a chance to make meaningful contributions. Yet, many\nbudding researchers learn to overcome their fears and discover that meeting the challenge is not only\nvery rewarding, but life-defining.\nTo address how that process unfolds, we asked the authors to tell their individual stories. We prompted\nthem to describe what forces drew them into the area in which they chose to specialize. Why would\nthey choose one area and not another? For some researchers, early life experiences stoked natural\ncuriosity about behavioral phenomena. For others, tutelage of a mentor inspired them to follow in the\nmentor's path. And for some, happy accidents helped them to identify the content that would give\nshape to their professional lives.\nTo model for beginning researchers how research gets underway, we asked the authors to describe how\nthey get specific ideas for their research. What factors tend to inspire them when they derive testable\nhypotheses? How might that be process have changed over time? Most authors describe a process quite\ncontrary to the stereotype of the lone scientist slaving away in a laboratory. They discuss the process as\nhighly collaborative, regularly drawing inspiration from the energy of the students who move in and out\nof their research streams, mutually enriching each others' lives. Some authors describe how they\novercame challenging problems in the development of their research. Many also describe how they\nmaintain vitality in developing the research stream that has defined their professional contributions. As\nthe authors dealt with these questions and issues, they also addressed the important issue of how\naspiring researchers can learn to develop research questions. Their consistent use of specific, relevant\nexamples brings this process to life in each of the research areas covered in this book.\nWe also asked our authors to capture the excitement of the fields in which they have become\nspecialized. This background helps to establish the context in which the researcher's own work can be\nrecognized as outstanding. Understanding the past and present also allowed our researchers to\nspeculate about the most exciting directions that their specialized areas may move in the future. We\nthink these speculations offer some of the most fertile suggestions for aspiring researchers who may be\nlooking for just the right field that will give definition to their life's work.\nFinally, we asked our authors to talk personally about the characteristics and skills that emerging\nresearchers will need to make contributions in these specialized areas in the future. Their advice\nincludes everything from the kinds of experience that you need to pursue to maximize the\nundergraduate experience through the qualities of personal discipline that will be necessary for a\nsuccessful research career. We think their advice offers a well-tailored advising session, which addressed\nthis important question: If this is the future I want, how do I get there?\nCommon Themes in Preparing for Life in Research\nNo matter what their specialization, our chapter authors consistently point to a number of general\nstrategies that help them generate research ideas, design viable research strategies, and move ahead in\nthe scientific understanding of behavior forward. We summarize many of those strategies here in the 5\nhopes that aspiring researchers can adopt the approaches that offer the greatest promise in getting\nthem started.\n\u2022 Finding and developing research ideas. No, you will not have only one research idea and then\nnever find another one. Ideas for good research projects are all around you! Here are a few\nsuggestions for where to find them. One excellent place to look is in the psychological journals.\nAfter reading a published article ask some of the following questions; trying to answer them can\nlead to very fruitful research projects. Is there a different way to conduct the research? Will I\nobtain different results if I do this project on my own campus? What if I use different\nparticipants? What does this article suggest is the next step in the research process? Each\njournal article should be able to provide several potential research ideas. Your textbooks also\noffer an excellent source of research ideas. Jot down your ideas in the margins as you are\nreading your assignments. The same thing can be said for class lectures; if you are paying\nattention to and involved with the material, you should not leave a class session without at least\none good research idea.\n\u2022 Look carefully at life around you. Every day occurrences also offer a wonderful source of\nresearch ideas. Here are just a few of the fascinating possibilities we came up with just by\nobserving the world around us. What can restaurant waitstaff do to increase tips? Do store\nclerks discriminate against certain types of customers? Is student responsibility associated with\ncertain personality types? Whatever the source, your supply of research topics is endless.\n\u2022 Be realistic about the ingredients of a good research project. In our technological age, it is easy\nto think that you must have lots of money and fancy equipment in order to conduct meaningful\nresearch. In some instances, such as conducting some research projects on the biological bases\nof behavior, money and equipment may be important. However, you will find that many\nexcellent projects require no fancy equipment and very little financial support. The main\ningredient of the good research project has always been, and remains, the good, creative\nresearch idea. You can conduct excellent research projects on a shoestring budget.\n\u2022 Research is not a one-shot endeavor. Be prepared to be hooked into a life-long passion. Once\nthe research bug bites you, you will not be able to stop with one project. The results of your first\nproject will lead to another project, which will prompt another, and so on. If you enjoy the\nongoing challenge of solving riddles and answering question, you are going to love research.\n\u2022 Recognize why you should get an early start. Never has competition to get into graduate school\nbeen more fierce. If you are to fulfill your dreams of becoming a researcher in psychology, you\nmust demonstrate your research imagination and skill during your undergraduate years. Good\ngrades, high board scores, and enthusiastic letters of reference help establish your research\npotential, but having legitimate research experience as a team member, a co-author, or a poster\npresenter at a psychology conference offer the kind of evidence that admission committees find\nmost useful. The more specifically you can articulate your research interests, the more likely you\nwill have the keys to open the door to graduate school.\n\u2022 Learn the literature. Research ideas rarely spring fully formed from a simple observation\nAlthough you will see a few really great examples of just that process, it is much more likely that\nresearch ideas emerge from carefully study of existing literature. Researchers often find their\nbest ideas in the discussion sections of published research that makes explicit suggestions for\nfuture refinements.\n\u2022 Identify the key players. As you read the literature, you will notice that some names begin to\nappear repeatedly in different sources that you read. This occurrence marks an individual whose\nresearch efforts have led to a concentration on a particular topic or issue. You may want to\nchange search strategies from reading about a general concept to reading about the research 6\nhistory of a given individual in that area. Following the publication trail gives you a good sense of\nwhat that researcher's unique history has been in helping our understanding about a given\nconcept unfold. Ultimately this strategy may prove helpful because you can define where the\nmost exciting research is occurring. The result may shape your application strategies for\ngraduate school.\n\u2022 Start small. As you begin to conceptualize new research avenues, you may fare best if you think\nin terms of small research ideas. Beginning researchers are sometimes tempted to want to solve\nenormous problems for which they have neither the time nor skill. Good research mentors will\nhelp you see how even small scale projects fit the overall growth of knowledge about human\nbehavior.\n\u2022 Read beyond the boundaries. Read voraciously, not just in the psychology literature but other\nsources as well. Current events, research in other disciplines, and even good literature may\nprovide just the inspiration you may need to develop a new twist.\n\u2022 Prepare for a full range of emotions in your chosen life. Research in psychology offer exquisitely\nexciting moments. For example, it is hard to characterize the thrill when an idea breaks out of\nthe chaos or a statistical analysis confirms just the prediction you were seeking. However, some\naspects of research are not only unexciting, they are downright tedious. Being successful in a\nresearch career means that you are willing to exercise self-discipline to weather the nonthrilling\naspects of generating research.\n\u2022 Identify faculty whose interests match your own. Many of our authors spoke to the critical\nimportance of finding a mentor in their chosen area. That connection routinely starts in\nadvanced courses in which faculty members have the opportunity to explain research processes\nthat have fueled their individual interests. You may be surprised to discover that material that\nyou thought initially was not very appealing takes on much greater significance through the eyes\nof researchers genuinely excited about their work. In many cases, these faculty members may\nhave research programs that would benefit from having a new team member. If you do secure a\nplace on a research team, remember there is usually a clear hierarchy for the tasks that must be\nshared. Most researches expect that people new to the research enterprise need to start out\nwith smaller responsibilities. Brand new members often face the work that requires the most\ndrudgery. As you prove yourself to be a reliable assistant, you will be granted more\nindependence and more exciting things to do.\n\u2022 Ask for help in finding a faculty mentor. If your faculty members are not actively engaged in\nresearch, they may be able to connect with others in the community who are doing research. If\nyou haven't had the good fortune of identifying such an individual from class experience, visit\nyour department's website. Typically departments will list faculty research interests. Some\ndepartments post research opportunities on the web or in the department newsletter.\n\u2022 Prepare to present yourself to potential mentors. Many researchers have an overfull agenda\nand will be very pleased at the prospect of a new team member. Others may initially respond to\nyour request as though it is a burden. Either way, you should strive to create the most positive\nfirst impression possible. Be prepared to explain clearly why you wish to join a specific team. It\nwill help if you are familiar with a researcher's accomplishments before you schedule your\ninterview. Explain how refining your research skills fits into your future plans. If you reveal that\nyou \"have to do research for your requirements,\" chances are good the prospective mentor will\nnot be terribly impressed with your personal motivation.\nOur hope is that this text will contribute to keeping the science of psychology a vital research enterprise\nas we move into the 21st Century We thank the authors for their generosity and patience in developing\nthis distinctive volume. We are also indebted to a hard-working corps of reviewers and editors to help us 7\ndevelop the right voice. We dedicate this book to the spirit of Harry Kirke Wolfe and all those\nreseacher/teachers who followed him by choosing to \"grope by starlight towards the daylight of a\nclearer vision.\"\nNotes on the E-Book Format\nThis electronic book represents an interesting experiment for the Society of Teachers of Psychology and\nthe e-book editors. We wanted to bring you some fresh and personal perspectives primarily to assist\npeople on the front end of their research journey as well as those teachers and researchers committed\nto helping them realize their dreams. Working in an e-book format can be a bit challenging. For example,\nyou will note uniformity in the appearance of all the chapters but one. One set of authors (Woods and\nKrantz) delivered their chapter ina coherent HTML package so we chose to retain their original design\nchoices. The other chapters have a more uniform and standard appearance. Because of some current\npeculiarities of HTML in dealing with italics, our references depart from APA format requirement in each\nchapter.\nDespite those minor difficulties, we are very excited about the advantages of e-publishing. At the\nconclusion of each chapter, you will find a picture and biography of the authors of that chapter. We also\nprovide a direct feedback capacity in which you can talk to the editors or the authors about your\nopinions of our work. You can also suggest other topics or authors that you think would make a good\naddition. And if the cyber-gods are willing, you should be able to download and keep copies of the\nchapters to help you at no cost to you. We intend to make the e-book available for three years from the\ndate of launching the e-book website.\nWe also want to thank Vinny Hevern, STP Webmaster, and Dave Johnson and Bill Hill, who are currently\nsharing presidential responsibilities for STP. Their support has been outstanding in helping this project\nsee daylight. We owean unpayable deb to Brian Halonen for long hours in helping us resolve endless\nproblems with web site publishing.\nReferences\nBenjamin, L. T., Jr. (1991).

This chapter explores the study\nof comparative psychology and animal learning from three perspectives--past, present, and future.\nReaders will learn that persons who have a personal fascination with animals and nature can turn that\ninterest into studying comparative psychology and animal learning and end up knowing more about the\nhuman animal as well. 12\nChapter 1\nCoping and Health\nSusan Folkman\nDepartment of Medicine and Center for AIDS Prevention Studies\nUniversity of California - San Francisco\nIt is practically impossible to avoid daily advice on how to cope with stress. This advice is proffered\nalmost nonstop by talk show pundits, authoritative writers in magazines and newspapers, ads for over-\nthe-counter stress antidotes, friends, and of course family members. This barrage of advice is based on\nwidely held assumptions that (1) stress is omnipresent in our lives, (2) stress can be harmful to health,\nand (3) these harmful effects can be avoided or reduced if we cope well.\nFew would quarrel with the notion that stress, no matter how it is defined, is omnipresent. It is\ncommonly experienced by most people on most days. But the generalizability of the effects of stress on\nhealth is not as broad as the media would have us believe. A review of the literature by Adler and\nMatthews (1994)shows that while there is evidence that stress can increase vulnerability to certain\nhealth problems including respiratory infections, infectious disease, and pregnancy complications,\nevidence is lacking that it affects the etiology of other diseases including cancer and endocrine disease.\nBut even if stress affects only a subset of all health problems, that it does so at all is important.\nRespiratory infections and infectious diseases, for instance, affect virtually all of us at one point or\nanother, and they are responsible not only for discomfort and misery, but for missed days at work or\nschool and increased medical costs.\nJust as we believe that stress affects health, so too do we believe that the harmful effects of stress can\nbe mitigated if somehow we learn how to cope with it. Presumably, those who cope well with stress will\nhave fewer illnesses, fewer infections, and fewer days lost from work than those who do not cope well.\nThis argument is logical, and it is appealing because it gives us hope that even if we cant escape stress,\nthere are things we can do to keep it from harming us. The burgeoning scientific literature on coping\nand health confirms that psychologists and other behavioral scientists find this idea appealing, too.\nStudies of the relationship between coping and health can be placed in two categories. In the first,\ncoping is looked at in direct relationship to health. Here the researcher is concerned with how the way\nan individual copes with a stressful situation or condition has a direct impact on his or her health. In the\nsecond, coping is looked at in indirect relationship to health. Coping, for example, is examined in\nrelation to health behaviors or mood, with the idea that behaviors or mood in turn affect health; but\ncoping is not expected to affect health directly. Instead, coping affects health through its impact on the\n}mediating\" variable such as health behavior or mood.\nIn the first part of this chapter, I review a few selected studies to illustrate each of these perspectives\nand summarize what they do and do not tell us about the relationship between coping and health. In\nthe second part of the chapter, I offer some thoughts on where I believe the field of coping needs to go\nnext in order to increase our understanding of the relationship between coping and health. Before the\nreview begins, I outline a few important conceptual issues regarding coping to provide a foundation for\nthe rest of the chapter.\nThe Literature on Coping and Health 13\nConceptual Issues\nOver the last twenty years most studies on coping and health have come to conceptualize coping in\nsurprisingly similar ways. The conceptualization is based on a definition of coping as the changing\nthoughts and behaviors that people use to manage distress (emotion-focused coping) and the problem\nunderlying the distress (problem-focused coping) in the context of a specific stressful encounter or\nsituation (e.g. Moos 1974; Pearlin & Schooler 1978; Folkman & Lazarus 1980; Lazarus & Folkman 1984;\nFolkman & Lazarus 1985; Moos & Schaefer 1993).\nSince this definition of coping is widely used, it is helpful to understand some of its nuances because\nthey can complicate the study of the relationship between coping and health. First, the definition\nimplies that coping is a dynamic process that changes as a single stressful encounter unfolds and across\ndiverse encounters, depending on changes in what the person is coping with. The changing and variable\nnature of coping poses challenges for the researcher. If coping were stable, it would be easier to use it\nto predict health outcomes because a single assessment would be highly reliable. But coping is not\nstable; it is changeable. Its changeable quality was demonstrated in a number of early studies that\nshowed, for example, that coping changes depending on whether the event is a harm, loss, or threat\n(McCrae, 1984) , the social role that is involved (Menaghan, 1982) environmental and social factors\n(Parkes, 1986) , and what is at stake and what the options for coping are (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980;\nFolkman, et al. 1986) .\nEven a seemingly simple stressful event, such as taking a final exam, has different phases, each posing\ndifferent demands for coping. Let\u2019s say that the stakes are high: the course is an important prerequisite\nfor graduate school, the exam is expected to be difficult, and the outcome is important because it\ndetermines the final grade. The encounter begins with a preparation phase, which requires organizing\nthe environment so that it is possible to study, getting the right materials for study, and then actually\nstudying. Then there is the exam itself, which requires managing anxiety so that it does not interfere\nwith test taking, thinking clearly, and coming up with good answers. This is followed by a waiting period,\nwhile the exam is being graded. And then finally there is the outcome -- the grade itself. Each phase of\nthe exam poses different coping demands, and as a consequence coping changes as the exam process\nmoves from one phase to another (Folkman & Lazarus, 1985) .\nSecond, coping is multidimensional. Most coping measures include multiple kinds of problem- and\nemotion-focused coping, usually between 6 and 8, although sometimes more than 20 (McCrae, 1984).\nThe multidimensional quality of coping poses challenges for analysis. Although the various types of\ncoping are conceptually distinct, they tend to be related empirically. For example, in a study of men who\nhad undergone coronary artery by-pass surgery, Scheier and his colleagues (1989) found that efforts to\nregulate distress, an emotion focused form of coping, interfered with making plans and setting goals for\nthe future, a problem focused form of coping. As another example, the use of cognitive reframing or\npositive reappraisal is typically associated with planful problem-focused coping (e.g. Folkman, et al.\n1986; Carver, et al. 1989) . This lack of independence makes it more difficult (although not impossible)\nfor any one type of coping to stand out as a single, strong predictor.\nThird, most coping scales are inherently less internally consistent than are measures of other constructs,\nsuch as attitudes. The internal consistency of a measure refers to the extent to which the items on a\nscale are measuring the same thing. The greater the internal consistency of a measure, the more reliable\nit is as a research tool. A person who responds to a questionnaire with good internal consistency about\nhis or her attitude toward environmental preservation, for example, is likely to endorse all items that\nare consistent with that attitude. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve high levels of internal 14\nconsistency with coping scales because of the nature of coping. If a specific coping strategy, e.g., turning\nto another task to get ones mind off the problem, is successful the person does not have to turn to other\nstrategies within that category. The one strategy worked, and therefore there is no need to do more.\nThis quality lowers the likelihood that an individual will check multiple strategies within a given category,\nthereby lowering the internal consistency of the measure of that category. This can be a problem\nbecause the coefficient that describes internal consistency puts a ceiling on the strength of the\ncorrelation that measure can attain with any other variable.\nThese quirky characteristics of coping create methodological obstacles in the study of the relationship\nbetween coping and health. Therefore, if a relationship is observed between coping, which is inherently\nvariable and multidimensional, and a health outcome, such as recurrence of an illness, days in hospital,\nor recovery, that relationship should be taken seriously. It is there despite great odds.\nThe study of the relationship between coping and health also depends on characteristics of the\ndependent variable. The dependent variable must have the potential for change over the time of the\nstudy. General health status variables, for example, tend to be quite stable in the general population\nand the probability that such variables might change during a study period that is arbitrarily chosen is\nnot great (Folkman, 1992) . On the other hand, health variables that are more changeable, such as upper\nrespiratory infections, muscular and skeletal problems, and gastrointestinal infections are more likely to\nchange over the course of several months and are more appropriate for the study of coping and health.\nFortunately, these conceptual and methodological issues have not brought research on coping and\nhealth to a halt. But it is helpful to understand these issues when reviewing the literature because they\ncan help explain inconsistencies in findings across studies.\nQuestions about coping and health are generally asked in one of three ways: 1) Do the ways people\ncope with stress in their daily lives affect their health? 2) Do the ways people cope with a health\nproblem affect outcomes related to the health problem such as illness progression or mortality? 3) Do\nthe ways people cope with a health problem affect their mental health or adjustment to the health\nproblem?\nCoping with daily stress and health\nHas research shown that the ways we cope with the stresses of our daily lives make a difference in our\nphysical health? It would be nice if we could say }Yes, and heres how you should cope.\" Unfortunately,\nstudies have not revealed any consistent insights about the direct effects of general coping with daily\nstress on general health in the general population. But coping with daily stress has been linked to health\nin the more specific cases of coping strategies that take the forms of injurious behaviors.\nMore than 40 years ago Conger (1956) formally proposed that people drink in response to stress as a\nmethod of reducing tension. Viewed from this perspective, drinking is a method of coping with stress.\nDrinking is normatively considered a maladaptive response because it neither helps resolve the\nunderlying problems nor does it effectively regulate distress. In fact, alcohol use generally increases\ndistress, and alcohol abuse has a deleterious effect on health.\nThat such behaviors are in fact often a response to stress was demonstrated in a study of abstinent male\ndrinkers (Brown, et al. 1995) . Those abstinent drinkers who experienced high levels of stress were more\nlikely to lapse than abstaining individuals not experiencing such stress. But whether or not drinking is\nthe coping strategy of choice depends in part on the extent to which the individual generally relies on\navoidant forms of coping, the availability of alternative ways of coping, social skills, and expectancies 15\nregarding the effects of alcohol (Cooper, et al. 1992) . A number of community studies have shown that\navoidant coping in particular is strongly associated with alcohol use (Cronkite & Moos, 1984; Timmer, et\nal. 1985; Cooper, et al. 1988; Moos, et al. 1990) . For a review of research on coping and substance use,\nsee Wills and Hirky (1996). Maladaptive health behaviors such as smoking and high risk sexual behavior\n(McKusick, et al. 1985; Chesney, 1988) and decreases in exercise (Ogden & Mitandabari, 1997) have also\nbeen interpreted as coping responses to stress. Alcohol, high-risk sexual behavior, and recreational drug\nuse in particular are considered behavioral forms of escape-avoidant coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984)\nthat can be directly injurious to health.\nCoping with health problems and health outcome\nThe most fruitful explorations of the relationship between coping and health have taken place within\nthe context of health problems. The literature is dominated by studies that explore the relationship from\nthe two perspectives mentioned earlier: the effects of coping with a health problem on health outcomes\nrelated to that problem, and the effects of coping with a health problem on mental health.\nPhysical health outcomes. A number of studies have examined the relationship between coping with a\ndisease such as cancer, myocardial infarction, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or HIV/AIDS, and a disease-\nrelated outcome such as recurrence, recovery, disease progression, or mortality. Rather than review all\nthe studies in this area, I begin this section by describing a series of studies on coping with cancer that\nsummarizes quite nicely what is known about coping and cancer and illustrates the complicated issues\ninvolved in investigating this question. Then I review a few selected studies from other diseases that\nillustrate other issues that are related to the question of coping and health in the context of specific\ndisease.\nA study by Epping-Jordan, et al. (1994) of the relationship between coping and disease progression\ndemonstrates how the relationship between coping and health is ultimately quite complicated. They\nstudied coping and health in a sample of 66 cancer patients diagnosed with a variety of different types\nof cancer including breast cancer, gynecologic cancers, hematological malignancies, brain tumors, and\nmalignant melanoma. They focused on avoidance, which refers to efforts to suppress dysphoric feelings,\nbecause several studies had shown a relationship between avoidance and poor physical outcomes (Suls\n& Fletcher, 1985; Holahan & Moos, 1986) . Instead of relying on the self-report that has been used in\nearlier studies, Epping-Jordan and her colleagues measured disease variables by reviewing medical\ncharts and patients reports of the prognosis they received from their oncologist. They measured disease\nstatus one year post diagnosis as a dichotomous variable: (a) no disease or (b) disease, including\npresence of original cancer, recurrence, of cancer, or death. Avoidance thoughts were measured with\nthe Impact of Event Scale (IES) (Horowitz, et al. 1979) . They also assessed psychological symptoms.\nParticipants answered the question on the IES with respect to their cancer.\nOne-year post-diagnosis, 48 patients (73%) were disease free, and 19 patients (27%) had their original\ncancers, had experienced a recurrence, or had died. After controlling for initial prognosis, avoidance\npredicted disease status one year later, but psychological symptoms did not. The authors commented\nthat previous studies (e.g., Cassileth, et al. 1985; Jamison, et al. 1987) may have failed to find\nrelationships between psychological symptoms and cancer progression because psychological symptoms\ndid not clearly reflect the cognitive and emotional processes that are most closely related to subsequent\ndisease progression in cancer patients. Presumably, avoidance -- the suppression of feelings -- is more\nclosely related to subsequent disease progression than psychological symptoms. 16\nThe reasons avoidance might directly affect disease progression are not immediately clear. Epping-\nJordan et al. (1994) offer two hypotheses: avoidance might affect immune functioning in cancer patients\nby contributing to continued high distress and emotional arousal; or avoidance might result in\ndecreased compliance with cancer treatments, which in turn could lead to worsened disease status. We\nwill return later to these hypotheses, because they are at the very core of the explanation about how\ncoping might be related to health.\nOther studies of coping and disease outcome in early breast cancer provide mixed support for the role\nof coping. A series of studies by Greer and his colleagues (Greer, et al. 1985; Greer, et al. 1990) and Dean\nand Suertees (1989, described by Buddeberg, et al., 1996) categorized patients as using one of four\nstyles of coping assessed with structured interviews: denial (described as positive avoidance), fighting\nspirit, stoic acceptance, and helplessness/hopelessness. The earlier studies by Greer, et al. (1985)\nincluded longitudinal assessments of 62 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer. Fifteen years later,\nwomen who had used fighting spirit or denial were significantly more likely to be alive and free of\nrecurrence than those with fatalistic or helpless responses. But as Buddeberg and his colleagues point\nout, the sample was small, and the histological node status, which is the best predictor of disease-free\nsurvival, was not documented.\nDean and Surtees (1989) replicated the study by Greer with a larger sample of 121 women. The women\nwere interviewed twice, before and 3 months after mastectomy, and these data were related to disease\noutcome 6 to 8 years after the primary surgical treatment. Coping was assessed using the same method\nas Greer had used, only Dean and Surtees assessed coping twice. Dean and Surtees found a relationship\nbetween coping and disease outcome, but the relationship depended on when it was measured. The\npatients coping responses were not consistent over time, and no clear relationship could be determined.\nBuddeberg et al. (1996) continued this line of research, focusing on the relationship between coping and\nsurvival in 107 breast cancer patients at a 5- to 6-year follow up. This study was strengthened by the\ninclusion of detailed medical data for each patient. Coping was assessed annually for the first three\nyears. At the conclusion of the follow-up period, 25 patients had died, and 81 survived. (One patient was\neliminated because she died of cardiac arrest.) Clinical variables, including tumor size and histological\nnode status were related to survival. Coping was not.\nThese studies of coping and cancer illustrate the challenges in determining the role of coping in health\noutcomes. The changeable nature of coping makes it difficult to use it as a predictor of health outcomes.\nMore important, the final study (Buddeberg, et al. 1996) shows that when dealing with a disease,\nbiological variables rather than psychological ones are likely to have more influence on survival.\nI would like to comment on a study by Reed, Kemeny, Taylor, Wang, and Visscher (1994) in which the\nfocus is not cancer, but AIDS, because it reports some intriguing findings on coping and survival. From\nthe early 1980s, when AIDS first appeared on the national public health agenda, until the mid 1990s\nwhen protease inhibitors and new antiretroviral treatments became available, the disease was largely\nuntreatable. Most people who were diagnosed with AIDS died within a few years of that diagnosis.\nAlthough treatments became available to treat specific opportunistic infections, little could be done to\nsignificantly extend survival time.\nDuring that period, Reed and his colleagues studied psychosocial factors that might affect survival time\nin a cohort of 74 gay men with AIDS. At the conclusion of their study in 1991, 61 had died of\ncomplications related to AIDS. The researchers found a relationship between realistic acceptance, a\npassive coping strategy, and decreased survival time in their prospective analysis. This study included a 17\nnumber of biological and medical measures (e.g., data from medical charts, measures of the immune\nsystem) and behavioral measures (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, and recreational drug use) in addition to\npsychosocial measures (e.g., optimism, distress, and coping). Six kinds of coping were assessed:\ncommunity involvement and spiritual growth, active cognitive coping, avoidance and self-blame, seeking\nsocial support, realistic acceptance, and seeking information. Realistic acceptance (}Try to accept what\nmight happen,\" }Prepare myself for the worst,\" }Go over in my mind what I would say or do about this\nproblem\") was associated with decreased survival time, even when the effects of other variables known\nto be important contributors to survival time were accounted for in the statistical models. These authors\nused only one assessment of coping in their predictions, so in this regard their study design was not as\nstrong as others. On the other hand, they included a wide range of medical, biological, and behavioral\nvariables in their analyses, and the coping variable still remained the most important predictor of\nsurvival time.\nReed et al. (1994) offer a number of possible explanations for the relationship between coping (realistic\nacceptance) and mortality, many of which will by now have a familiar ring. They suggest that men who\nreport more accepting responses may engage in different behaviors relevant to health outcomes than\ntheir less accepting counterparts. Also though the study controlled for a number of such behaviors,\nother health-related behaviors, such as monitoring of relevant symptoms, seeking medical advice, and\ncompliance with medical treatment may have been adversely affected by realistic acceptance. It is also\npossible that realistic acceptance was sensitive to unfavorable changes in health status that were too\nsubtle to be captured by their measures. This would account both for realistic acceptance and increased\nmortality. Finally, they suggest that realistic acceptance may have an impact on immune or viral\nprocesses affecting health status in individuals diagnosed with AIDS. In short, Reed et al point out that\nrealistic acceptance, rather than directly affecting health, probably operates through other mechanisms\nthat affect health.\nOccasionally we come across studies that illustrate how certain coping strategies may be maladaptive\nwith respect to health in the contexts of certain diseases, but not in others. Studies of coping with\ncoronary heart disease, for example, suggest that denial-like coping, which is traditionally considered\nmaladaptive, can be health-protective at certain stages of disease. Meta-analyses by Suls and Fletcher\n(1985) were consistent with clinical observation that denial can be adaptive immediately following an\nacute myocardial infarction, but less adaptive in later stages. In their review of coping with chronic\ndiseases, Maes, Leventhal and de Ridder (1996) summarize a number of studies that are consistent with\nthis pattern. They cite studies, for example, reporting that strong deniers spend fewer days in the\ncoronary care unit and have fewer signs of cardiac dysfunction during their hospitalization compared\nwith weak deniers, but in the year following discharge they are less compliant with medical\nrecommendations and are rehospitalized more often (Levine, et al. 1987) .\nStudies of coping with chronic pain show that cognitive or behavior strategies that divert the patients\nattention from the pain to some other activity help reduce the patients awareness of pain (for review\nsee Katz, et al. 1996) . Such strategies differ from denial in that diversion does not imply denial of what\nis happening. But diversion strategies are similar to denial in that they are a way of avoiding or reducing\nawareness of an aversive condition. Diversion types of coping, however, can be maladaptive if there are\ntreatments or procedures that require the patients attention and effort. HIV+ individuals who are on\ncomplicated treatment regimens that require a great deal of vigilance, for example, would have adverse\nhealth outcomes if they engaged in diversion and denial (Ickovics & Chesney, 1997) . The same is true of\ndiabetic patients whose disease requires close control. 18\nAs another example, information seeking is generally considered an adaptive form of coping. But\ninformation seeking is associated with adverse outcomes under certain conditions. For example,\neducation and information were associated with increased reports of pain and disability in rheumatoid\narthritis patients (Park, 1994) . Maes et al. (1996) explain this counterintuitive result by suggesting that\nthe increase in education and information, which was provided through an intervention, increased the\npatients sense of vulnerability and diminished the adequacy of patients disability. A similar finding was\nreported by Chesney and her colleagues (1996) in a study of a coping intervention for HIV+ gay men.\nThis study included a coping skills group, an HIV/AIDS education and information group, and a no-\ntreatment control. The anxiety level of the HIV/ADS education and information group increased,\nsuggesting that the additional knowledge, while possibly helpful with respect to strategies of the\nmanagement of their illness, was also anxiety provoking, especially in the absence of training in skills for\ncoping with the anxiety.\nFinally, there is also a growing literature on the adverse health consequences of suppression of emotion,\nan emotion-focused coping strategy, such as that described by Epping-Jordan and her colleagues (1994)\nin the study of cancer that I mentioned earlier. Since 1983, James Pennebaker has conducted a number\nof studies based on a general theory of inhibition and confrontation. This theory assumes that inhibiting\nor holding back ones thoughts, feelings, or behaviors requires work. Over time, the work of inhibition\ncan be viewed as a long-term form of low level stress that can create or exacerbate illness and health\nproblems (Pennebaker, 1992) . In a number of studies, Pennebaker and his colleagues have found that\nindividuals who suffered major trauma in childhood are far more likely to become ill if they never talked\nabout the trauma (Pennebaker & Susman, 1988; Pennebaker, 1989) . Others have found that inhibiting\nforms of emotion-focused coping are also associated with poorer recovery from surgery. In their study\nof patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, for example, Scheier and his colleagues (Scheier,\net al. 1989) found that patients who tried to suppress emotion just before surgery had poorer recovery\npatterns six months later. This provocative line of research is still in its early and exploratory stages, but\nit has generated interest among health psychologists.\nMental health outcomes. Both acute and chronic illnesses and conditions create psychological stress for\nthe individual. The most severe psychological challenges are posed by those illnesses or conditions that\nare painful, interfere with the individuals daily role functioning, disrupt personal relationships, cause\ndisfigurement, and result in both temporary and permanent loss. Uncertainty, whether about test\nresults, efficacy of treatment, recurrence of symptoms or the disease, effects of the disease, time until\nrecovery, degree of recovery, and so on, is pervasive, and this is the source of a great deal of stress in\nany acute or chronic illness. To maintain well-being in the face of these kinds of stressors requires\ncoping. The psychological stress caused by health problems is thus fertile territory in which to examine\nhow coping with psychological health-related stress affects outcomes related to adjustment and mood.\nAnd, in fact, a great deal of research has been done to determine what kinds of coping seem to promote\ngood adjustment outcomes to health-related problems and what kinds of coping seem to make things\nworse.\nMental health outcomes of coping with health-related stressors are important not only because they\nhave inherent value with respect to patients well-being and quality of life, but also because they may be\nimportant mediators of the relationship between coping and physical health. For example, our study of\nthe effects of the chronic stress of caregiving in the context of AIDS on the physical health of the primary\ninformal caregiver showed that coping was not directly related to health symptoms, but it was related\nindirectly through its relationship to negative mood (Folkman, August, 1997) . 19\nThe findings regarding relationships among health problems, coping, and distress are quite consistent\nacross diseases including cancer (e.g., Dunkel-Schetter, et al. 1992; Stanton & Snider, 1993; Chen, et al.\n1996) , rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., Felton & Revenson, 1984; Zautra & Manne, 1992) , systemic lupus\nerythematosus (e.g., McCracken, et al. 1995) , myocardial infarction (e.g., Estreve, et al. 1992) , heart\ntransplantation (e.g., Dew, et al. 1994) , and HIV/AIDS (e.g., Friedland, et al. 1996) . Avoidant forms of\ncoping are generally associated with greater distress, and problem-focused coping and positive\nreappraisal are generally associated with less distress. The pattern is observed in both cross-sectional\nand longitudinal studies. This consistency of this pattern suggests that regardless of the disease, disease\nseverity, or the specific kinds of adaptive tasks that confront the individual, taking an active stance and\ntrying to look at the situation as positively as possible is beneficial in terms of mood, whereas engaging\nin cognitive and behavioral forms of escape and avoidance is detrimental.\nThe danger of making a sweeping generalization of this sort is that inevitably there are exceptions. In\nthis case, the exceptions are found when characteristics of the person and the situation are taken into\naccount. Both exceptions have to do with the fit between the personal or situational characteristic and\nthe type of coping. With respect to person characteristics, for example, Suzanne Miller (e.g., Miller,\n1987) has examined dispositional coping styles related to information-processing behavior. Monitors are\ndisposed to seek information about threat, and blunters are disposed to avoid threat-relevant\ninformation. Miller and her colleagues have examined the relationship between preferences for\nmonitoring and blunting, information, and health behaviors and distress and found that high monitors\nand low blunters fare better with more information and more attention and reassurance and low\nmonitors and high blunters fare better without information, attention, and reassurance (for review, see\nMiller, et al. 1988) .\nWith respect to situational characteristics, the extent to which the situation is one that can be changed\nor that has to be accepted affects the relationship between coping and mood and behavioral outcomes,\ntoo. Theoretically, people fare better psychologically when there is a fit between options for coping and\nactual copingprocesses. Problem focused coping is more appropriate in situations where something can\nbe done, less so in situations that have to be accepted; and emotion focused coping is more appropriate\nin situations that have to be accepted, and less so in situations where something can be done. This\nhypothesis, which has been called the }goodness of fit\" hypothesis (Folkman, et al. 1979; Folkman, 1984)\n, has been examined in a variety of settings including natural disaster (Baum, et al. 1983) and stressful\nlife events (Forsythe & Compas, 1987; Mattlin, et al. 1990; Vitaliano, et al. 1990; Conway & Terry, 1992) .\nWith respect to health, Christensen, Benotsch, Lawton and Wiebe (1995) found that it helped explain\nadherence to fluid intake in hemodialysis patients. For controllable stressors related to hemodialysis,\nproblem focused coping was associated with more favorable adherence, and for less controllable\nstressors, emotion focused coping was associated with more favorable adherence.\nOne of the unanswered questions is whether coping affects mood, or mood affects coping. Although\nlongitudinal designs in which coping is used to explain changes in mood over time indicate that coping is\nassociated with changes in mood (e.g., Felton & Revenson, 1984; Stanton & Snider, 1993; McCracken, et\nal. 1995; Folkman, et al. 1996) , this does not rule out the possibility that mood also influences coping.\nThe relationship between escape-avoidant forms of coping and depressed mood, for example, suggests\na bi-directional process in which depressed mood leads to escape-avoidant (passive) forms of coping,\nwhich in turn increases depressed mood (possibly because the underlying problem remains or even gets\nworse in the absence of more active coping). The vicious cycle between avoidant coping and negative\nmood was proposed by Felton and Revenson as a way of understanding deterioration in adjustment\nindices of patients with chronic illness. 20\nTo the extent that the relationship between depressed mood and escape-avoidant coping is indeed\nreciprocal, the causal relationships can be established in both directions. Why, then, do most\nresearchers focus on the coping ----> mood direction rather than the mood ----> coping direction? One\ncompelling reason is that coping is potentially amenable to change. Cognitive-behavior interventions, for\nexample, that try to alleviate depressed mood involve the teaching of coping skills. The assumption is\nthat the vicious cycle between escape-avoidant coping and depressed mood can be interrupted by\nreducing reliance on maladaptive escape-avoidant coping and increasing the use of adaptive problem-\nfocused coping and strategies for reframing or reappraising a situation.\nConclusions\nThe vast literature on coping and health is evidence of the widespread belief that the ways people cope\nis somehow linked to their health. Direct effects of coping on health are probably relatively infrequent,\nand are most likely limited to behavioral forms of coping that can be injurious to health, such as\nsubstance use and high risk sexual behavior. Indirect effects of coping on health, on the other hand are\nprobably relatively frequent. One likely causal pathway suggested by research is the pathway through\nmood. Coping is strongly associated with mood, which in turn can affect health behavior and ultimately\nhealth. Another pathway that merits consideration is when active and avoidant forms of coping directly\ninfluence health behaviors, such as entry into the medical system, adherence to a treatment program,\nor ordinary behaviors of eating and exercising. There are also hypotheses, largely untested, that coping\ncan affect immune function, possibly through mood, and immune function can in turn affect resistance\nto infectious diseases.\nResearch on Coping and Health: Where to Go from Here?\nThe overarching conclusion that emerges from research on coping and health is that to the extent that\nsuch a relationship does exist, it is most likely mediated through behavioral, affective, or immunological\npathways, or some combination of all three. I am not expert enough to comment on possible\nimmunological pathways. For those interested in the specific relationship between immune function and\ncoping I recommend the work of Margaret Kemeny, Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, and Arthur Stone.\nOne of the most obvious directions for research on coping and health has to do with the subject of\nadherence. Advances in treatment have transformed some diseases that were previously fatal, such as\nHIV/AIDS, into chronic diseases that require adherence to treatment regimens over many years, and\nthey have increased the complexity of other treatment regimens, such as Type I diabetes. As more and\nmore previously terminal illnesses are transformed into chronic diseases that require long-term\nmanagement, adherence becomes an increasingly important mediator of the coping-health relationship.\nWe need more research on factors that interfere with adherence and factors that promote adherence.\nCoping is implicated in this research to the extent that stress affects individuals motivation and capacity\nto adhere.\nIt is clear that research about the relationship between coping and health will be helped along by\nimproved measures of coping and coping outcomes. With respect to coping, paper-and-pencil measures\ncan always be improved, but I would like to suggest that we turn to more qualitative techniques. It is\ntime to supplement what we can learn with paper-and-pencil measures of coping with the analysis of\nnarrative data. Peoples stories can provide us with different ways of thinking about coping and how it\nmight be related to health. Our study of caregivers of partners with AIDS contained narratives that gave\nus exciting insights into meaning-based coping. In fact, the narratives that the men provided at the time\nof their partners deaths were so rich that I believed no one set of analyses would do them justice. So I 21\ninvited four sets of investigators, each with experience in narrative analysis in the areas of bereavement,\nor emotion, to analyze the same set of narratives from 30 men. This study resulted in four articles on the\nsame data, each using a different theoretical framework and a different method of qualitative analysis,\nand each producing different insights into responses to bereavement (see Folkman, 1997; Pennebaker,\net al. 1997; Stein, 1997; Weiss & Richards, 1997; Nolen-Hoeksma, et al 1997) .\nThe measurement of coping outcomes also needs improvement. Thought needs to be given to the\ndomains of outcomes that coping can reasonably be expected to affect. Currently, little thought seems\nto be given to this question. Measures of distress or psychological symptoms seem to be included in\nmost coping studies almost automatically, without a clear rationale. Likewise, measures of physical\nhealth are included without a clear rationale as to why or how coping might be related to them. One\nentire domain of coping outcome that is rarely assessed has to do with the individuals ability to sustain\nhis or her social roles in the face of stress and distress. People who are in the midst of severe stress may\nhave high levels of distress no matter how well they cope, but they may still need to be able to function\nin their roles at work, with their family, or in the community. A good measure of coping outcomes\nshould therefore also include an assessment of role functioning (Folkman & Moskowitz, 1998) .\nIn this section, however, I want to discuss coping and positive affect in the context of stress, a topic that\nhas intrigued me for years. Although positive affect is sometimes included in studies of coping and\nmental health, little thought seems to have been given to its significance in the coping process. The\ndomain of positive affect holds the potential for an exciting expansion of our understanding of how\ncoping affects health. Let me make my case.\nCoping and positive affect: Future directions\nMy interest in positive affect was reinforced by findings from our study of caregiving partners of me with\nAIDS that we conducted from 1990 until 1997. The 253 participants were for the most part in their late\n30s and early 40s when the study began. This is a time of life when most people devote themselves to\nestablishing long-lasting relationships, not bringing such relationships to a close. The participants were\ntheir partners primary caregivers, and as such they were confronted with challenges that were\nextraordinary in their complexity, intensity, duration, and requirements for expertise. These caregivers\nneeded empathy, clinical knowledge, technical expertise, advocacy skills in the formal health care\nsystem, and what seemed to be unlimited emotional, mental, and physical stamina (Wrubel & Folkman,\n1997) . As if this were not enough, about one-third of the participants were themselves HIV+. We\nassumed that this group would be doubly stressed because of the double-whammy of the caregiving and\ntheir own vulnerability to AIDS. Participants were interviewed every two months for the first two years\nand then every six months for three follow-up years. In addition to caregivers, the study also included a\ncomparison group of 61 HIV+ men who were in relationships with healthy partners. The inclusion of this\ngroup allowed us to specify effects in the HIV+ caregiver group that were attributable to their HIV\nserostatus vs. their caregiver status.\nWe used multiple measures of both positive and negative psychological states. We expected and found\nhigh levels of negative psychological states. Throughout caregiving, participants levels of depressive\nsymptomatology were typically more than one standard deviation above the norm in the general\ncommunity, rising to two standard deviations above the norm at the time of the ill partners death\n(Folkman, et al. 1996) . Among the 156 caregivers whose partners died, levels of depressive symptoms\nreported during their first seven months of bereavement were comparable to those of bereaved\nspouses, and at seven months following the partners death, mean scores for depressive symptoms were\nstill one standard deviation above the general community norm (Folkman, et al. 1996) . We were not 22\nsurprised by these findings, given the extensive literature on the profound and enduring effects\ncaregiving and bereavement have on depressed mood.\nWhat we did not expect was that participants also reported high levels of positive psychological states\nduring the course of caregiving and bereavement (Folkman, 1997) . Caregivers whose partners did not\ndie during the course of the study reported positive states of mind at a level that was comparable to a\ncommunity sample of urban university students not experiencing unusual stress (Horowitz, et al. 1988) .\nThroughout this same two year period, caregivers whose partners did not die experienced positive\naffect with at least as much frequency as they experienced negative affect (Folkman, 1997 ). Among\ncaregivers whose partners died during the two-year period, the death of the partner was associated\nwith modestly lowered scores on measures of positive psychological states during the month leading up\nto the partners death and for the five after the partners death. But after five months, scores on\nmeasures of positive states returned to their pre-bereavement levels.\nA number people suggested that our finding might be limited to the community of gay men living in San\nFrancisco, possibly because of the social support network that evolved in this community during the\n1980s and 1990s, and possibly because of the upbeat influence of }New Age\" beliefs. We were offered\nthe opportunity to include the measures of depressive mood (CES-D, Radloff, 1977) and positive and\nnegative affect (modified Bradburn, 1969) that we had used in our study of AIDS caregivers in Dr.\nMiriam Stewart's study of mothers of chronically ill children (diabetes, spina bifida, or cystic fibrosis) at\nDalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Dr. Stewarts sample differed from the San Francisco sample\nof AIDS caregivers not only in that it was all female, but unlike the San Francisco sample, the Nova Scotia\nsample was not advantaged educationally or financially, and they lived about as far from San Francisco\nas is possible within the North American continent. Despite these demographic differences, we found\nthe same patterns in the mothers of chronically ill children as we had in the sample of gay men in San\nFrancisco: depressive mood was elevated, but at the same time the frequency of positive affect was not\nonly comparable to the frequency of negative affect, it was even significantly greater .\nZautra and his colleagues (Zautra, et al. 1990) examined positive and negative events in a longitudinal\nstudy of mental health in disabled and bereaved older adults. Both kinds of events were reported, again\nindicating the co-occurrence of positive and negative events. Zautra and his colleagues also made the\ninteresting observation that the value of daily positive events vis a vis mental health was variable across\ngroups. Bereaved individuals showed no positive effects of these events on their mental health, whereas\ndisabled individuals showed sizable impacts. These researchers suggest that the major loss suffered by\nthe bereaved group may overshadow all other experiences, changing the way in which positive events\nare interpreted. In contrast, for those who are disabled, daily positive events can represent significant\nachievements that can boost morale.\nAffleck and Tennen (1996) focus on the related question of discovery of benefits from living with\nadversity. This phenomenon has been documented in the context of numerous medical problems.\nAffleck and Tennen distinguish between benefit-finding, which refers to beliefs about benefits from\nadversity, and benefit-reminding, which is the use of such knowledge as a deliberate strategy of coping\nwith the problem. Thus, a person with a new medical condition that limits her mobility might come to\nbelieve that this is an opportunity for her to develop new strengths (benefit-finding), and she might\ndraw on this belief (benefit-reminding) in situations where the limits to her mobility are particularly\nstressful.\nI go even further in considering co-occurrence of positive and negative events or moods in terms of\ncoping. My colleagues and I have suggested that positive psychological states -- whether in the form of 23\npositive events or positive affect -- serve three important coping functions under conditions of chronic\nand severe stress (Lazarus, et al. 1980; Folkman, 1997; Folkman, et al. 1997) . Positive emotions, such as\neagerness and excitement, help motivate people to initiate coping under adverse conditions. These\nemotions -- challenge emotions -- go hand in hand with threat emotions such as anxiety, fear, and\nworry. Positive emotions, such as pleasure in what one has accomplished, or love for the one is caring\nfor, help sustain people when the going gets tough. Positive emotions such as happiness at seeing a\nbeautiful sunset or the enjoyment of a humorous comment, provide relief from distress. Events that\ngive rise to these emotions might ordinarily be considered unremarkable or unnoteworthy. The need for\nrelief -- for a psychological time-out -- from distress is what motivates these emotion responses. All\nthree functions could help explain the finding by Zautra, Reich et al. (1990) that positive events had a\nsalubrious effect on the mental health of disabled individuals.\nFurther, I don't think people are passive with respect to generating these emotions. I think people\ngenerate these emotions through a deliberate and effortful coping process. A number of very fine\nscientists, including Shelly Taylor and her colleagues (e.g., Taylor & Brown, 1988; Taylor & Brown, 1994 ),\nRonnie Janoff-Bulman (1989) , Roxane Silver and Camille Wortman (Silver & Wortman, 1980; Silver, et\nal. 1983; Wortman, et al. 1993) , and Glenn Affleck and Howard Tennen (Affleck & Tennen, 1996) have\nwritten about psychological and social processes that people use to generate positive states when bad\nthings happen. In our own research, we identified four meaning-based coping mechanisms that help\naccount for positive affect: positive reappraisal, which is cognitive reframing of what has happened or\nthat which might happen; goal-directed problem-focused coping, which includes knowing when to\nabandon goals that are no longer tenable and substituting new goals that are both tenable and\nmeaningful; using spiritual or religious beliefs to seek comfort; and the infusion of meaning into the\nordinary events of daily life in order to gain a psychological time-out from distress (Folkman, 1997;\nFolkman, et al. 1997; Stein, et al. 1997) .\nBecause most coping research has focused on negative affective outcomes and states of mental health,\nwe know only part of the story. We need to address this imbalance in coping research by researching\nquestions related to positive outcomes, including the coping processes that sustain them, underlying\ncharacteristics of the person and the social environment that promote these coping processes, and the\nfunctions of positive affective outcomes in the overall process of coping with health-related stress. The\nmethodological issues that both characterize and impede research on coping and health, including the\nvariability of coping processes, the problems inherent in trying to measure appropriate health\noutcomes, and the measurement of coping itself, apply to the study of coping and positive affect every\nbit as much as they do to the study of coping and other health-related outcomes. There are some\nexcellent discussions of these methodological issues (for reviews see Aldwin, 1994; Zeidner & Endler,\n1996) . Taking these methodological problems into account, and with the belief that future researchers\nin this area will be creative and thoughtful enough to solve them, I strongly encourage researchers on\ncoping and health to look more carefully at positive as well as negative affective outcomes, to\nunderstand the relationship of these outcomes to health related behaviors, and to identify the cognitive\nand behavioral coping processes that uniquely support positive outcomes.\nReferences\nAdler, N. & Matthews, K.

Little\nCarleton University and\nMurray Research Center\nRadcliffe Institute for Advanced Study\nHarvard University\nIntroduction: Voices in the Cafeteria\nImagine that we are listening in on a conversation between three students in the college cafeteria. Their\ndiscussion weaves around many topics but the dominant theme is their common project of applying to\ngraduate school in psychology. Speaking animatedly and downing her third cup of coffee, Eve declares\nthat she is only applying to her top three choices and she's looking forward to dragging her boyfriend to\nAnn Arbor. She suddenly bolts from the group realizing she's late for her stats class. Adam says little,\nnods often, and is wondering whether he really is grad school material. Besides, his parents want him to\ngo back home after graduation to work in the family business. Nikki isn't really listening at all; she's hung\nover again, hadn't realized grad application deadlines were coming up, and frankly is fed up with Adam\nand Eve and the whole human condition. She mumbles something they can't quite hear and heads for\nthe restroom.\nIf you are sitting in the adjacent booth in the cafeteria, would you linger a bit, intrigued by the differing\nstyles, contrasting concerns, and singular stories you hear emerging in the snatches of conversation? If\nso, then you probably have a natural affinity for personality psychology. This chapter surveys the past\nand present state of personality psychology as a core specialty within psychology and examines how it\ngoes about understanding the lives of the Eves, Adams, and Nikkis of this world.\nThe field of personality psychology is flourishing. In many respects the current buoyancy of the field\nreflects important shifts, both methodological and conceptual, that have occurred over the past two\ndecades. Some of these changes arose in response to conceptual crises within the field, particularly the\nGreat Trait Debate that occupied much of the field in the seventies. (Mischel's (1968) critique, which\nlaunched the debate, and reactions to it are discussed in a later section) .Other shifts reflect the gradual\nmaturing of intellectual agendas that were present at the modern inception of academic personality\npsychology in the nineteen thirties (Craik, 1986). After sketching very briefly the nature and challenges\nof the field of personality psychology, I will present a perspective (admittedly an idiosyncratic one) on\nsome of the currently active research programs in the 'new look' in personality psychology.\nThe Core Project of Personality Psychology: The Integrative Challenge\nWithin the social and behavioral sciences, personality psychologists have chosen to specialize in\ncomprehensiveness (Little, 1972). As an intellectual field its scope of inquiry is inordinately extensive.\nPersonality psychology seeks to integrate diverse influences on human conduct ranging from the genetic\nand neurophysiological underpinnings of traits to the historical contexts within which individual life\nstories can be rendered coherent. Pervin (1996) has provided a thoughtful definition of personality\nwhich, in part, characterizes it as \"the complex organization of cognitions, affects, and behaviors that 31\ngives direction and pattern (coherence) to the person's life\" (p.414). The study of personality seeks to\nunderstand how individuals are like all other people, some other people, and no other person (to revise\nslightly the classic phrase of Kluckhohn & Murray, 1953, p.53). It formulates theories about the nature of\nhuman nature, the role of individual differences, and the study of single cases. Personality psychology\nprovides one of the core basic sciences underlying many of the fields of applied psychology, including\nclinical, counseling, health, and organizational psychology.\nClassical Voices and the Conceptual Foundations of Personology\nEven a cursory history of the classical theoretical and methodological perspectives in personality\npsychology exceeds the limits of this chapter, but fortunately two recent reviews provide authoritative\nand concise accounts of the history of personality psychology (McAdams, 1997; Winter & Barenbaum,\n1999). But it will advance the purpose of this chapter if we have some major historical figures in the\nfield, metaphorically descend (or ascend) from their places in posterity to offer their perspective on the\ncafeteria conversation with which we began this survey. Their role will be like that of the Greek Chorus\nin classical drama that offered commentary about the ongoing action. (Except that none will speak in\nGreek and some won't speak, but sing. Or hum.) They will introduce some of the concerns and\nadmonishments of classical personology and provide a bridge to contemporary discourse about the\nfield.\nLet us start with a Freudian chorus (perhaps the Vienna Old Boys Choir?). There is little doubt that\npsychoanalysis has had a profound impact on the intellectual climate of the twentieth century. Many in\nfact would claim that its impact has been greater in the arts and humanities than in the social and\nbehavioral sciences. In essence the Freudian psychodynamic perspective held that unconscious wishes\nand the vicissitudes of their expression comprised the core integrative concepts necessary to\nunderstand the complexities of both normal and abnormal personality. Thus the reach of psychoanalytic\ntheorizing extended from the clinical couch to the psychopathology of daily life, from the deepest\nneuroses to the seeming innocence of typing misrakes. Through the theoretical lenses provided by\nFreudian theory, Eve's tardiness, Adam's ambivalence, and Nikki's petulance might reflect the subtle\noperation of unconscious wishes and defenses against them. Such influences would likely be sexual or\naggressive at root. A Freudian chorus might choose Nikki as the most obvious case for explication of the\npossible influences of unconscious and destructive forces in human personality because of the welling\nup of impulses that compromise her ability to muddle through this particular Monday. But they would\nalso have comments to make about why Eve is late only for her stats class and why Adam has never fully\nbeen able to break away from the Edenic security of his home.\nThe Personological Chorus would feature Henry Murray with counterpoint commentary by Gordon\nAllport, both of whom would be draped in Harvard Crimson. Like Freud, Murray would insist that the\nmotivation of the students would run deep. Rather than focusing exclusively upon sex and aggression,\nhe would insist that there are diverse needs that underlie human motivation, such as the need for\naffiliation or need for achievement. He would voice concern that the environments within which human\nmotives play out should also receive our attention, and that for each need operating in personality there\nis a corresponding \"press\" in the environment that can facilitate or frustrate its achievement. Finally,\nMurray would be concerned that we expand the time line to look at \"serials\"--the sequences of action\nthat extend over longer periods of time and without which the significant motivational agendas of\npeople's lives may be given shorter shrift than they deserve.\nAllport would generally concur, but would suggest that traits are the substantively real and dynamic 32\nsources of human personality and that both the nature and organization of such dispositions are\npatterned idiosyncratically. He would also argue that although pursuits may originally be undertaken for\none set of motives, they may eventually become independent or \"functionally autonomous\" of the\noriginating motivation.\nFor these personologists, the ways in which the three students are approaching their last weeks as\nundergraduates may reflect different patterns of needs and the ways in which the environments are\nfulfilling or frustrating the achievement of the needs. Eve may be primarily concerned with a need for\npower, and her seeking admission only to the elite schools may help her to develop influential\nconnections. This would contrast with her classmates, high in achievement motivation, who may apply\nto a greater range of schools to optimize likely success. (See Winter (1996) for an excellent description\nof need research in the tradition of Murray and his followers such as McClelland). Adam may have a\nstrong need for self-abasement--a need his parents are only too happy to satisfy when he broaches the\ntopic of heading off for grad school. Nikki might be particularly intriguing to the personologists. Not\nsatisfied to dismiss her behavior simply as aggressive or neurotic, they may see her as a complex person-\n-perhaps a highly creative personality whose needs are being systematically frustrated by environmental\npress that keeps her from exploring ideas that she and others find strange and disturbing.\nWe might hear next from the Behaviorist Chorus comprising the early learning theorists and joined by\nthose such as Dollard and Miller who attempted to translate psychodynamic theory into behaviorist\nprinciples and of course Skinner whose clear voice of confidence about the power of operant\nconditioning would likely drown out the rest of the Chorus. The behavioral analytic units would be\nstimulus-response bonds that would allow an integration not only of human personality but the\nbehavior of all organisms. This perspective placed considerable emphasis upon the shaping of\npersonality by environmental contingencies, particularly by the rewards and punishments that\nreinforced behavior. For the behaviorists, the differences between our three students, Eve's\nascendancy, Adam's diffidence, and Nikki's emotionality (and drinking problems), arise from differences\nin their reinforcement histories and the commonalities arise from their desire to avoid painful\nstimulation and seek out rewards.\nA third distinctive voice can be heard in the cafeteria: that of George Kelly. At the same time as\nbehavioral theories were in ascendancy in psychology, Kelly proposed an original and audacious theory.\nHis integrative mission was to weave theoretical, assessment, and clinical concerns into a seamless\nmodel of human personality. Kelly postulated that to understand individuals was to understand the\npersonal constructs through which they viewed their worlds. Kelly saw each of us as a \"lay\" scientist--\ntesting out hypotheses about ourselves and our worlds and revising those hypotheses (constructs) in the\nlight of experience. These personal constructs are organized into systems such that some of them\nbecome core role constructs, centrally important to the lives of individuals. Their preservation and\ncontinued validation have a profound effect on emotional experience. For example, according to Kellian\ntheory, threat is awareness of an imminent and comprehensive change in one's construct system. Guilt\nis awareness of being dislodged from one's core constructs, aggression is the expansion of core\nconstructs to subsume new domains, and hostility is the attempt to extort validation for a construct one\nalready feels has been invalidated (Kelly, 1955). So how would the Kellian Chorus in the cafeteria (more\nlikely an Irish tenor solo) attempt to understand our three students? Kelly would likely see all three\nstudents as feeling threat at the prospect of being in transition between undergraduate life and their\nfutures. Adam may feel guilt in that he is being dislodged from a core construct of being loyal to his\nfamily. Eve may be aggressively pursuing confirmation of her construct of herself as successful. Nikki, we\ncan now disclose, has experienced a series of abusive relationships. She may have experienced what 33\nKellians refer to as serial invalidation of her core constructs, in which each attempt to anticipate her\nworld is painfully disconfirmed. Her only strategy left is to attempt to extort validation of her worth by\nacting abrasively toward those who have failed to notice her pain. For Nikki, only a worthy person has\nthe temerity to tell her friends to \"piss off\". Or so she tells herself.\nThese classic voices from personality psychology each approach the integrative task by developing\noverarching theories of considerable scope, though each selectively highlights a particular aspect of\nhuman conduct as its integrative center. Thus classical psychodynamic theory is primarily concerned\nwith emotional experience, learning theory with overt behavioral processes, and Kellian theory with the\ncognitive systems through which personality unfolds. Yet each extends the range of its theoretical\nconstructs to include phenomena that are of more focal concern for alternative perspectives. Indeed,\nwithin psychodynamic theory, a major historical progression involved a shift from emphasis upon\nunconscious motivation, to a conflict free domain in which conscious goal pursuit could be carried out\nwithout being subordinated to the pressures of irrational impulses and wishes. Thus, psychodynamic\ntheory was able to push its conceptual agenda into an area that would be regarded as more the domain\nof cognitive psychology. Similarly, learning theorists over the century have moved from drive-reduction\nand peripheralist theories to cognitive social learning theories (e.g., Bandura, Mischel), in which the\ninfluence on human action has shifted from classical and operant conditioning, or rewards and\npunishments to more cognitive concerns, such as schemata, encoding skills etc. (e.g., Mischel, 1990).\nCritical Voices: Challenge and Restoration in Personology\nThe field of personality psychology was thrown into considerable conceptual turmoil with the\npublication of Walter Mischel's (1968) Personality and Assessment. Mischel mounted a detailed critique\nof broad dispositional traits as units of analysis in personality psychology. Specifically, he argued that\nthere was little evidence for broad-based generalities of trait dispositions (e.g., an Adam may be\nsubmissive around his fellow students and his parents but assertive and confident when playing in his\njazz band). He also provided evidence that specific tests of personality traits had little predictive validity\nin accounting for actual behavior and seldom exceed a \"personality coefficient\" limit of .30. Thus,\nMischel's attack was antagonistic to the classical personological perspectives and particularly to those\nwho offered fixed traits as analytic units for the field. His allies, interestingly, were rather strange\nbedfolk: behaviorists (who by then were transforming into cognitive social learning theorists) and\npersonal construct theorists--a direct reflection of Mischel having been a student of George Kelly's.\nMischel's central contentions were that human action was finely attuned to situational influences, and\nthat such action was less the product of fixed traits than of the personal constructs or conceptual lenses\nthrough which individuals viewed the world.\nThe impact of Mischel's critique was pivotal for the field of personality in three ways. First, it had a\nmajor effect upon personality testing by calling into question the validity of such tests. Second, it\nencouraged greater collaborative linkages with social psychologists, who had traditionally regarded the\nmajor sources of human action to lie in the situations and environmental contexts with which individuals\nwere confronted (Endler & Magnusson, 1976). Finally, and most significantly, it stimulated an\nimmediate, protracted, and eventually successful defense of the orthodox trait model by personality\npsychologists. While feeling that the strengths of the personological tradition had been underestimated\nby Mischel, they also conceded that greater conceptual grappling with some of the foundational issues\nin personality measurement were now urgently needed (Wiggins, 1997). The result of the clash between\nthese critical voices was an enrichment and broadening of the conceptual base of personality\npsychology. The social cognitive learning alternative, espoused by Mischel, continues to generate 34\nconsiderable research (e.g., Cervone & Shoda, 1999; Mischel & Shoda, 1995). But a full scale restoration\nof trait psychology also came about as a result of the Great Trait Debate and, as we shall see, it now\nconstitutes one of three major contemporary perspectives in the field. It is to these contemporary\nvoices that we can now turn.\nContemporary Voices: Three Tiers for Personality Psychology\nContemporary personality psychology is multifaceted, complex, and dynamic. One particularly helpful\nway of organizing this complexity for expository purposes has been proposed by McAdams (1995). I will\nadopt this as a starting point to review three different levels at which personality psychologists are\nexploring the nature of human nature and explaining the ways in which individuals live out their lives.\nHavings, Doings, and Beings in Personality Research\nThe first level of inquiry in contemporary personality research is that of relatively fixed features of\nindividual differences emphasizing personality traits. The second level explores more contextually\nsensitive and dynamic units of analysis that McAdams labels personal concerns. (McAdams includes\nmany more constructs at this level than I will treat in this chapter. I have tried to make the case that the\ncentral integrative units at this level are Personal Action Constructs (PAC units) (Little, 1989, 1996)). The\nthird level addresses individuals' life stories and the narrative identities that people construct to make\nsense of their lives. Invoking terms introduced by Allport and re-introduced by Cantor (1990), we can\nrefer to Levels 1 and Levels 2 as reflecting the \"having\" and \"doing\" aspects of human personality\nrespectively. \"Having\" refers to that which we are endowed with and carry with us and \"doing\" refers to\nthat which we intentionally perform. Because Level 3 is concerned with identity and the sense of self\nthat individuals construct, and to preserve the gerundial form of depicting the field, we can refer to this\nas the \"being\" aspects of personality. Collectively this structure of the contemporary field of personality\nresearch can be thought of as exploring the havings, doings, and beings of individuals.\nFor initial expository purposes, we can conceive of these three levels as different tiers or floors of a\nhouse. Thus, personality psychology can be thought of as having trait psychologists on the ground floor\nexploring the nature of stable dispositions. On the second floor are a group of psychologists who are\ninterested in people's personal concerns, and carry out research with PAC units, such as current\nconcerns, personal strivings, personal projects, and life tasks (Little, 1996, 1999a). On the third floor are\nthe narrative theorists and psychobiographers who are examining identity and life stories. As I have\nsuggested elsewhere however, (Little, 1996), the \"house of personality\" would be incomplete unless we\nadded a basement in which would be housed two other active groups of contemporary personality\npsychologists, psychodynamic theorists and evolutionary psychologists. I wish to turn now to a\ndescription of some of the important questions, methodological tools, and research findings on the\nthree main levels of personality psychology. We shall deal with the cellar in due course.\nLevel I (\"Havings\"): Traits as Enduring Dispositions\nStable traits of personality were not only a foundational unit of analysis in academic psychology, they\nhave been invoked ever since humans have communicated about their lives and those of others. The\nnotion that stable individual differences arise out of differences in bodily humors is an ancient one and\nthere has been an enduring interest in attempting to classify and predict individuals on the basis of traits\nassumed to be part of the constitutive nature of human beings. These have often been thought of as\naspects of people that they \"have\" and that they carry with them through the contexts, challenges, and 35\npivotal moments of their lives.\nThe Big Five: Major Factors of Personality Traits\nConsensus has gradually emerged that stable features of human personality can be adequately\ndescribed by five factors of neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and\nconscientiousness (e.g., McCrae & John, 1992; Wiggins, 1996). Neuroticism is characterized by attributes\nsuch as being nervous, worried and feeling emotionally insecure. Extraversion is depicted by attributes\nsuch as excitement seeking and activity level. Openness entails broad interests and imaginative\ndispositions. Agreeableness involves tendencies toward being good natured and trusting.\nConscientiousness is associated with characteristics such as being organized and disciplined.\nThus, at first blush, Eve, in our opening image, might be described by others as being a rather\nextraverted, open individual; Adam could be regarded as agreeable and conscientious, while Nikki might\nbe seen as at least incipiently neurotic.\nMuch of the current conceptual and empirical research in the field of personality is concerned with the\ndescriptive, explanatory, and predictive implications of the five factor model. The five factor model is\nseen by most psychologists as primarily a taxonomic description of personality structure rather than a\ncausal model that precisely predicts behavior. Indeed, there are a number of different explanatory\nmodels for each of the big five factors of personality, two of which in particular, extraversion and\nneuroticism, have been well developed. As one example, extraversion has been postulated by Eysenck\n(1970) as a dispositional tendency to seek out stimulation, particularly social stimulation, as a result of\nchronically low levels of activation in the neo-cortex.\nA somewhat different model of extraversion formulated by Gray (1981), assumes that extraverts are\nparticularly sensitive to reward cues, while introverts are more sensitive to punishment cues\n(particularly so if the individuals in both cases are also high in neuroticism). Both these and other models\nof extraversion based on a biological model have been bolstered by evidence that there appears to be a\nstrong genetic base underlying extraversion as well as the other big five factors.\nThus, under these models, we might expect the extraverted Eve of our example to be particularly keen\nto seek out stimulation and to absorb herself in the conversation about grad school, and not to notice\nthat it was time to go to class. We might also predict that she would be more likely than her introverted\npeers to need a good dose of caffeine in the cafeteria to sustain her through her stats class. And we\nmight anticipate that she may not yet have thought through some of the down side issues in applying\nfor graduate school (\"Hey, what are these GRE thingies we're supposed to take\"?).\nAs well as having descriptive and explanatory functions, traits are increasingly being used for purposes\nof prediction in applied areas. For example, there is evidence that conscientiousness is a robust\npredictor of success in many areas where achievement is important, particularly achievement based on\nconformity to clearly specified goals (see Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp,& McCloy, 1990). However,\nthere appears to be one intriguing exception. Hogan and Hogan (1993) have reported that\nconscientiousness is negatively correlated with peer rated success among Tulsa jazz musicians. Given\nthat the ability to \"jam\" involves being able to \"flex\" to the shifting cadence and intonations of others,\nthe goal-oriented persistence of the conscientious person may become a liability. This exception may\nnot, in fact, be so exceptional. It is interesting to speculate whether organizational life, particularly in\nfast-paced high tech companies, is more likely to require the skills of juggling and jamming than those of 36\ndogged linear pursuit. So even though traits may be fairly stable, the personality psychologists using\nthem as predictive instruments are fully aware of the need to monitor their predictive validity in\ndomains that are changeable and dynamic.\nHow might our three students be understood in terms of the Big Five trait approaches to contemporary\npersonality psychology? Eve would appear to be an open, agreeable extravert, seeking stimulation,\nconfident in her expectations, and generally engaged in zestful project pursuit. Adam might be seen as\nmore introverted and conscientious. He seems to be agonizing over the question of grad school and is\ntrying to balance it against other claims on his life. We might see Nikki as distinctly neurotic: she is\nangry, anxious, hurting, and inexpressibly sad.\nLevel II (\"Doings\"): Personal Projects, Tasks, and Strivings\nOver the past couple of decades, another family of conceptual units of analysis in personality psychology\nhas arisen which complement, and in some ways challenge, trait units. They have as a common focus an\nemphasis upon personal action: on the doing side of personality (Cantor, 1990; Little, 1999a). These\npersonal action constructs (or PAC units) include personal projects (Little, 1972, 1983; 1989), personal\nstrivings (Emmons, 1986), and life tasks (Cantor, 1990).\nPersonal projects are extended sets of personally salient activity that can range from short bursts of\naction, such as \"meeting Adam for coffee\" to the defining commitments of one's lifetime, such as \"try to\nrespect my parent's wishes.\" Projects are conceived of as middle level units in personality (Little, 1987,\n1989) in that they are influenced by superordinate goals such as core values, and they generate\nsubordinate acts through which the project is implemented. Though projects are action units, the fact\nthat they are personal means that they cannot be directly inferred from mere observation of an\nindividual's acts. Personal projects typically proceed through the stages of project inception, planning,\naction, and termination. However, the fact that they are embedded in a daily ecology that involves flu\nbugs, returning boyfriends, irate roomates and computer system crashes (sometimes simultaneously)\nmeans that projects are in continual flux and their successful management involves a blend of tenacity\nand suppleness. Quintessentially, personal projects analysis is about the social ecology of muddling\nthrough.\nTo illustrate, let's follow Adam for a while. We catch sight of him as he arrives on campus on Wednesday\nmorning. He sits alone in the cafeteria, skims a few pages of his Personality text, and heads off to a\nPhysics lecture. He sits frozen faced, trying to suppress his yawning, leaves quickly after class, pauses\nmomentarily in the hallway, and then slowly walks along the river to his residence. He slams the door,\nputs on a CD, and starts to cry: What's up?\nFrom a trait perspective we might say that he is showing signs of introversion by avoiding much contact\nwith others and perhaps that he is a bit neurotic (his crying might be seen as dysphoric). But at Level II\nhis behavior is approached rather differently. From a personal projects perspective we would ask the\ncrucial question \"What have you been up to today\" to which he may well respond with \"trying to get a\ndate with Jennifer\". The outward and visible signs of his behavior may have made little thematic sense\nuntil we get that crucial piece of personal construing. His cafeteria stop prior to class had been a\nreconnaissance mission to see if Jenn was there that morning. His boredom in class may have made\nmore sense to the physics professor (who may have been attributing unwarranted \"thickness\" to the\nstudent) if he had known that Adam wasn't even registered in the course: the only reason he was there\nwas to be near Jennifer, a physics major. Adam's dithering in the hall was a failed implementation of his 37\nintention to approach Jennifer, who only knows him as a rather \"wimpy\" person who seems to be\nfollowing her around. His emotional release back in residence was in frustration that once again he\nlacked the courage to ask her out.\nResearch on personal projects involves asking people what their current personal projects are, and then\nto appraise each project on a set of approximately twenty dimensions that have both theoretical and\napplied importance for personality psychology (e.g., enjoyment, stress, control). These ratings, which\ncan be appraised at both the individual level of analysis and normatively, can be summarized as falling\nunder five major theoretical factors: project meaning, structure, community, efficacy, and stress.\nResearch to date confirms the proposition that subjective well-being is related to the extent to which\npeople are engaged in personal projects that are worthwhile (meaning), managed effectively (structure),\nsupported by others (community), likely to succeed (efficacy), and not unduly onerous (low stress)\n(Little, 1989, 1999a, b, 2000a, b).\nThe content of personal projects has also been shown to be important. For example, being engaged in\nintrapersonal projects, those dealing with trying to change or deal with aspects of one's own personality\n(e.g.,\"be less subservient to my parents\", \"try to figure out why I am always so angry\", \"be more\noutgoing\"), is positively associated both with a tendency to experience depressive affect but also with\nthe Big Five factor of Openness to Experience (Little, 1989). From a personal projects view then, Nikki\nmight be expected to be engaged in a number of such intrapersonal projects. But whether she sees\nthem as likely to succeed or not might well influence whether she flourishes as a creative intellectual or\nbecomes immobilized in self-hatred.\nTwo other PAC units, each in part derived from personal projects methodology, have stimulated\nconsiderable research interest. Nancy Cantor and her colleagues (e.g., Cantor, 1990) have examined\npersonal action in the context of what they term \"life tasks\". Life tasks are undertakings that are\nimportant to accomplish at different stages of life. Cantor explored these in her influential study of the\ntransition of University of Michigan students through undergraduate life (Cantor, Norem, Niedenthal,\nLangston, & Brower, 1987). Students generated lists of personal projects which they then categorized in\nterms of alignment with several types of life task deemed important for university students. Subjects\nwere able to categorize many of their projects as being in the service of life tasks such as \"getting\nindependent of parents,\" \"forming friendships,\" or \"succeeding academically.\"\nCantor's research has shown how the successful management of life tasks requires social intelligence,\nparticularly the sensitive deployment of appropriate strategies through which tasks can be successfully\naccomplished (Cantor & Fleeson, 1994). Two such strategic approaches have been identified by\nresearchers on life tasks: defensive pessimism and illusory glow optimism (Norem, 1989). The former\nstrategy involves envisaging a worst case scenario (\"I'm going to fail this exam\") and harnessing the\nanxiety to motivate studying and task persistence. The opposite strategy involves imaging best case\nscenarios (\"I'm going to ace this exam!\") and having this positive incentive motivate studying. The life\ntask researchers have shown some intriguing implications of the adoption of these two strategies. They\nseem to be equally effective in terms of actual academic attainment, but the defensive pessimists seem\nto incur social costs in terms of being more of a burden on others. Thus, Nikki's repeated bemoaning of\nthe difficulties of finishing up term without falling apart may work just as well as a motivational strategy\nfor studying as Eve's optimism. But friends start to tune Nikki out and potentially valuable resources for\nher appear not to be answering their phones at college that month.\nAnother PAC unit that has stimulated considerable research activity is that of Emmons' personal 38\nstrivings (Emmons, 1986). A personal striving is something that a person is typically trying to do. Thus,\nAdam's acts of listening empathetically to Nikki and writing a letter home may be in the service of the\npersonal striving of \"being nice to people.\" Emmons and his colleagues have shown that human well-\nbeing is enhanced to the extent that personal strivings are appraised as likely to be accomplished and\nare not in conflict with each other. If Adam's \"Be nice\" striving is in conflict with a \"be intellectually\ntough\" striving, his well-being is likely to be compromised (Emmons & King, 1988).\nClearly, these three PAC units are closely related, though each has a particular zone of applicability that\nsuggests it is worthwhile to preserve the subtle distinctions between them (cf. Krahe, 1992). My own\nperspective sees personal projects as middle level units that can be in the service of both personal\nstrivings and life tasks. Eve's personal project of completing her stats assignment may serve both her\nstriving of \"competing with her brother\" and the normative life task of \"doing well in academic tasks.\"\nBut she may also be involved in personal projects that are only loosely coupled with a personal striving\nor life task such as \"talking to Nikki about the way she dresses.\"\nNikki's whole project system at college may be a protracted exercise in meaningless pursuits, unlinked to\nsuperordinate goals, and bereft of intrinsic meaning. Each of the PAC perspectives would see this state\nof affairs to be problematic. It should also be noted here that one of the major differences between the\nBig Five and PAC units is that the former are postulated to be relatively unchangeable after about the\nage of thirty (Costa & McCrae, 1994). So, while there may be some latitude left for Nikki to change her\ntrait of neuroticism as she stumbles through her early twenties, there is greater tractability for change in\nher personal projects, and perhaps in her life tasks and personal strivings . At the very least there is the\npossibility of helping to clarify them and enhance the likelihood of them being pursued effectively. And,\nunlike traits, these reformulations and transformations can be tried on throughout the life-span--even\nwhen Nikki gets old and wobbly.\nLevel III (\"Beings\"): Life Stories and Personal Narratives\nA third major growth area in contemporary personality theory and research is the narrative turn that\nhas occurred in recent years (Sarbin, 1986). The major thrust of this perspective is that humans have a\ndeeply rooted need to construct narratives within which their lives make sense. We construct stories not\nonly about our relationships, our achievements, and our aspirations, but we also tell stories in order to\nestablish an identity, to establish validation about the type of \"being\" we are or are becoming.\nMcAdams (1993) has developed an elegant theory of personality in which life stories form the central\nfocus. Life stories are built around various representations of self. Indeed, the very process of \"selfing\"\nas McAdams calls it, emerges only in the construction of a compelling life story that meets certain\ncritical features such as being coherent. A key element of the life story is the development of \"imagoes\"\nwhich are like stock characters in a story and are often personifications of the themes of agency and\ncommunion.\nThe narrative theorists in contemporary personality psychology would have much to say about our\ncafeteria conversations. First and most obviously, the students are conversing! During conversation we\ntypically tell each other stories about how things are going, what's up, who's doing what (and where and\nwhy). Second, the stories we tell as we talk with others enable us to tie together personally salient\ninformation from the other two levels of personality research. Eve doesn't just list her trait\ncharacteristics or her projects, she casts them in narrative form (\"I know I'm too pushy with Eric, and he\nreally doesn't want me to go to grad school, but I think he's fooling himself and I'll straighten him out 39\nbefore the end of April. More coffee Adam?\" ) In these conversations and story telling, Eve's imago\nseems to be a blend of agency and communion--perhaps seeing herself as the Directive Therapist. Eric,\non the other hand, may see her as Eve, the Avenging Traveler.\nA third consequence of the narrative perspective to personality is that the mere telling of our tales can\nhave a salutary effect. Pennebaker (1989) has shown that when students are asked to write personal\nnarratives that deal with previously unshared painful material, there is an initial increase and then a long\nterm decrease in measures of autonomic arousal. The effect is particularly notable with students who\nchoose to tell deeply revealing stories. These results are consistent with the research of Wegner (1994)\nwho has shown that \"not thinking\" about certain things can be taxing. (Wegner directs his subjects, for\nexample, to not think of a White Bear. I admonish the reader not to think about this example.) Thought\nsuppression actually increases the likelihood of thinking about the suppressed image and can extract an\nautonomic cost. If Nikki, then, were finally to get the chance to unload, to open up and tell her story, she\nmay be less likely to anesthetize herself against the unspoken aspects of her life.\nVoices from the Cellar: Psychodynamic and Evolutionary Perspectives in Personality\nWe have tried to capture the kind of theoretical conversations that we would hear at each of three\ndifferent levels in the house of personality. In some respects, the metaphor is fitting-- often the research\nbeing carried out on one floor is done in ignorance (not necessarily willful) of work going on at the other\ntwo levels. I also think that the second floor offers ways of \"listening in\"on conversations on the\nnarrative upper deck and down below with the trait-ers. But, to extend the metaphor one level further, I\nthink there is a need to acknowledge some very strong rumblings from the basement cellar. Here is\nwhere power plants and sump pumps are chugging along and the kind of discourse going on down there\nabout personality is similarly foundational and, some would say, earthy.\nI see two basement areas operating at this deepest level of personality: psychodynamic theory and\nevolutionary psychology. The first provides a line of continuity with the modern origins of personality\ntheory. The second provides a link with the Darwinian roots of modern life sciences.\nA spirited treatment of the contemporary revival and sustained relevance of psychodynamic theory for\npersonality psychology can be found in Westen (1990). One of the most noteworthy accomplishments of\ncontemporary psychodynamic theory has been wide spread acceptance of one of its most basic\nassumptions: the pervasive impact of unconscious influences on personality functioning (Erdelyi, 1974).\nFor example, when patients are exposed to subliminal stimuli that are symbolically related to their\nparticular problem, there appears to be some relief of symptoms ( Silverman & Weinberger, 1985). That\nsuch messages are not consciously recognized yet have a discernible impact on human functioning\nmeans that at least some of the dynamics going on in the college cafeteria are not accessible to the\nparticipants or to their personality research professors (not unless armed with hidden portable\ntachistoscopes). A general sense of tension and pervasive unease between Nikki and Adam, for example,\nmay be the result of the continuous influence of impulses that each has imperfectly repressed. To an\nastute psychodynamicist, there may be subtle hints revealed in gesture and the parapraxes (such as slips\nof the tongue and memory lapses) that lead to mixed messages and missed meetings. Such influences\nare perplexing and their detection requires probative work that is both demanding and subtle.\nOn the other side of the basement are the evolutionary psychologists. David Buss (1991), in particular,\nhas pioneered the study of how evolutionary adaptation has shaped human personality. The essential\nargument of this perspective is that in the course of evolution various strategies which conferred 40\nadaptational advantage were selectively retained and transmitted to the next generation. Though these\nadaptations evolved in adaptive landscapes radically different from those that confront us today, the\nmammalian brain still shows evidence of these primordial adaptations.\nOne of the important claims of the evolutionary perspective is that there will be sex differences in the\ncriteria that guide selection of future mates. It is argued that women will place a premium on the status\nof prospective mates, while men will regard the physical attractiveness of mates as differentially\nimportant. Note that it is not being claimed that these will be the most important or the only important\ncriteria, in fact pleasantness of personality is the top criterion in mate selection for both sexes. But it is\nargued that the sexes should differ in the rankings of these attributes for evolutionary reasons. Physical\nattractiveness serves as a marker of potential fecundity in the female, and status cues serve as markers\nthat a male will be able to provide resources that will support the viability of offspring.\nEvolutionary personality theory also posits that there will be important sex differences in emotions, such\nas jealousy. Males are more jealous when their mates engage in sexual infidelity and women more if\ntheir mates establish emotional romantic interests in another woman.\nAn early and similar perspective to the evolutionary personality psychologists is Hogan's (1982)\nsocioanalytic theory. Hogan was one of the first to emphasize the significance of the fact that human\npersonality evolved in the context of group life. Group living requires that individuals be particularly\nsensitive to two key issues--establishing social bonds with others and negotiating the power hierarchy:\nin short of \"getting along\" and \"getting ahead\" (Hogan,1982).\nLike psychodynamic forces, those arising from evolutionary principles may have an influence that eludes\nawareness. Adam may not have consciously chosen to ask Jennifer out because she was \"drop dead\ngorgeous\" (let alone likely to bear his child), though she is sure that this is the main reason he keeps\nhanging around. He may well have consciously formulated the goal of taking her out because she\nseemed nurturing and responsive at a party in September. Meanwhile Eve will feel deep frustration\nwhen Nikki asks her why she wore provocative clothes when Professor Buss gave a colloquium in their\ndepartment. \"Give me a break\" says Eve, and rolls her eyes, while Nikki responds with a smile that is\npart twinkle, part smirk.\nMy own view of the evolutionary perspective in personality theory is that it provides some intriguing\nhypotheses about the distal roots of human personality that otherwise seem inexplicable. My concern is\nthat we not underestimate the importance of another achievement of mammalian evolution--the\ndevelopment of a neocortex that allows us to formulate and carry out core projects that can override\nthe primitive motivational processes of more ancient origin. In my view, peoples' accounts of what they\nare doing should take initial priority particularly when we are dealing with things that are important to\nthem in their lives. Thus, I would be more inclined to believe Adam's explanation of his reasons for\npursuing Jennifer than those that might be offered under the evolutionary hypothesis. Such a\n\"credulous\" approach, which is consistent with Kelly's view of the individual as co-scientist, works well\nwithin the normal boundaries of daily conduct. If, however, there is consistent evidence that all of the\npeople Adam finds nurturing just happen to be beautiful women, I would be inclined to look to\nevolutionary theory to help explain why this is so. Perhaps it is in the dark passages of personality and\nthe extreme edges of human conduct that both the psychodynamic and evolutionary perspectives\ndeservedly attract our attention. The prevalence of violent jealousy and the pervasiveness of \"powerful\nman, nubile woman partnerships\" reminds us that we are, after all, an evolved mammalian species with\nadapted minds and that this heritage has the potential to influence us in powerful ways. (Do not think of 41\na White House.)\nPersonality in Context: Situations, Places and Environments\nOne of the central tenets of behaviorism, as well as the Mischellian critique of traits, was that human\nconduct is often generated by the context within which it is embedded. Murray, too, it will be recalled,\ninsisted on the need to appraise the press of the environments within which human needs were\nsatisfied or frustrated. A brief word, then, about the role of contextual features in contemporary\npersonality. How do the theorists on the three levels view the environments within which personality\nprocesses are played out?7\nOn the first floor, trait psychologists are concerned with the extent to which there is an appropriate\ndegree of \"fit\" between persons and their environments. Extraverts, for example, require stimulating\nenvironments for optimal functioning, while more introverted individuals require more structured and\nmodulated environments. While Eve may thrive on a week filled with parties and recreational\ndiversions, Adam may find walking by the river for getting his thoughts together about Jennifer, his folks\nand the upcoming GRE exams. Along with tools for the assessment of personality characteristics, there\nare abundant scales and inventories for the appraisal of the \"personality\" of environments, so that there\nare practical ways of determining the degree of fit between people and their contexts along a number of\nkey dimensions. Such tools allow us to formulate and answer the essential question about persons and\nenvironments talked about on the first floor:\"got a match\"?\nOn the second floor, the PAC theorists are more concerned with the extent to which environmental\ncontexts serve to generate, facilitate, or frustrate personal action. The pursuit of one's core projects,\ncherished strivings, or vital life tasks requires an environment within which such pursuits are valued, or\nat the very least not impeded. Personal contexts may be the major source of the projects that people\nregard as worthy of exploration , but they may also proscribe the kind of pursuits that people even dare\nto consider. Eve's home environment may have been such that the thought of doing anything other than\npursue a graduate degree after college was simply not an option. Nikki's home environment may have\nbeen one in which the possibility of graduate school brought blank stares of incredulity and the blunt\nquestion of \"who the hell is going to pay for that?\" Unlike trait perspectives, then, second floor theorists\nare more likely to look at the environment less in terms of \"fit\" than in terms of ecological factors such\nas affordances, resources, impedances, and constraints (Little, 1999b; Phillips, Little & Goodine, 1997).\nThe third floor narrative theorists are positioned to view the environment with a broader sweep and\nthey are particularly interested in locating individual life stories in their historical contexts. Sarbin\nprovides a fascinating analysis of how life trajectories can be entrained to the cultural myths that define\na particular historical time and place--for example, the pervasive myth of the avenging hero who\nsacrifices his life to avenge wrongs done against his people in the past (Sarbin, 1996).\nLinking Levels: A Contemporary Example of Meeting the Integrative Challenge\nPersonality theorists have argued that the enduring mission of personality psychology has been to\nprovide both theoretical and methodological tools for integrating the diverse system of influences\naffecting the lives of individuals and accounting for their differences. We have also shown that much of\ncontemporary personality research is taking place in three relatively independent sectors concerned\nwith traits, action, and narratives, each of which has its own integrative task. Trait psychology provides\nan impetus for integration of taxonomic work on stable personality characteristics with, as just one 42\nexample, neurophysiological research thus providing an integrative bridge to the neurosciences.\nPersonal action psychology, particularly in the focal role given to the concept of goals, provides a natural\nbridge to cognitive science as well as to social ecological perspectives that explore the ways in which\ngoal pursuit is embedded in and contributes to middle level dynamic contexts. Narrative psychology\nprovides a natural bridge to the humanities and to a broad corpus of literary, historical, and political\nscholarship that charts the larger currents of thought, tradition, and myth that define culture.\nAlthough we may well have horizontal integration within each of these three levels of contemporary\npersonality research, is there a way of vertically integrating them so that we might bridge the full\nspectrum of influences on human personality? Not only do I think the answer is a strong \"yes, indeed\", I\nalso think that it is precisely in this bridging research between levels in personality that some of the\nmost interesting new findings are emerging. Such bridging or linking research should also allow us\naccess to the theoretical insights of the classical perspectives in personality whose voices guided us\nthrough the early history of the field.\nNot surprisingly, given my own theoretical orientation, I feel that it is on the second floor--where the\naction is--that we are offered the best opportunity for conceptual commerce with the trait-ERs\ndownstairs and the narrative theorists up in the loft. We shall even show how our understanding of\npersonal projects can be enriched by taking a trip down to the basement on occasion. I want to illustrate\nthis by showing how research on personal projects allows us to move through each of the different\nlevels of research in personality and, in this way, to continue to struggle with the broad band integrative\nchallenge that defines our field.\nTo illustrate this, let's return to the cafeteria and take \"Getting into graduate school in psychology\" as a\nprototypical personal project and one shared by all three students. Research studies from several\ndifferent theoretical perspectives and levels of analysis in personality have addressed the content,\nappraisal, and dynamics of personal projects.\nWe can start in the basement. Although the evidence from this level is more indirect than at the other\nlevels, it offers one of the most intriguing areas of interlevel influences on personality and one of the\nmost challenging areas for future research.\nUnconscious Influences: Particularly at the inception stages of a personal project, it is likely that\nunconscious processes may play a subtle, even powerful role, in directing its course of including whether\nthe project is even considered in the first place. For example, Baldwin, Carrell & Lopez (1990 ) reported\nan intriguing study in which graduate students at the University of Michigan appraised the likely success\nof their research projects for the next term. For half the students, prior to their ratings, a tachistoscopic\nimage was flashed of the scowling face of a highly distinguished and rather threatening Michigan\nprofessor. For the other half, the smiling face of a less threatening post-doctoral fellow was flashed.\nThose exposed to the threatening face rated the likely success of their research projects to be lower.\nIn other words, pre-conscious images that involve threat may lead us to evaluate our projects in\npowerful ways. Indeed, such images may actually serve to proscribe a project as something that one\nsimply cannot do or should not do. Thus Adam's ruminations about grad school as he walks by the river,\nmay well be guided by the image of his parents' disapproving looks and snippets of conversation about\ngrad school being a waste of time.\nDo the other cellar dwellers have relevance to the pursuit of our students' projects? Though more 43\nspeculative, I think the evolutionary perspective offers some intriguing possibilities for explaining project\nchoice (see Buss, 1989). When we look at the content of the projects generated in the listing of our\nstudent research collaborators, it is easy to see projects that represent quintessential evolutionary tasks\nof mate selection, competition, social bonding, etc. It would be possible to create an evolutionary task\ntemplate (based on relevant project appraisal dimensions such as the extent to which this project\ninvolves competing with other males, etc.) that would allow a researcher to estimate the degree to\nwhich appraisals of projects can be explained by their match with the theoretical expectations of\nevolutionary theory.\nMoving up a level to that of the trait psychologists, there has been extensive research showing the\nrelationships between traits and the content and appraisal of personal projects (e.g., Little, Lecci, &\nWatkinson, 1992; Salmela-Aro, 1992). Among the most robust findings have been that\nconscientiousness is strongly related to the personal project factors, such as efficacy and absence of\nstress. Perhaps more surprisingly is the consistent evidence that conscientiousness is also strongly\nrelated to the perceived meaningfulness of projects, particularly to its enjoyment. The image of\nsomeone who is highly conscientious as a rather joyless creature slogging away on her ANOVAs at the\ncomputer terminal is more myth than reality. If Eve happened to score high on conscientiousness, her\nseemingly cavalier tactic of applying only to three schools may not be so cavalier at all. She may already\nhave thrown herself into researching the schools, having email correspondence with prospective\nadvisors, and actually visiting the campuses before sending off her applications. And our research would\nsuggest that for Eve these projects would be a delight, not a drag. Nikki, on the other hand, has probably\nprocrastinated again, and regards the whole application process as a Royal Pain. This pattern likely\nreflects Nikki's status on another of the big five dimensions, neuroticism. Salmela-Aro (1992) has\nprovided important evidence that depression is significantly associated with the tendency for personal\nprojects to be pursued with less effectiveness and less likelihood of successful completion, and Pychyl's\nextensive program of research on procrastination and well-being provides clear evidence of the\ndeleterious effects of Nikki's style of dealing (or not dealing) with her projects (e.g., Pychyl & Little,\n1998).\nTwo aspects of environmental influences have also been shown to be associated with appraisals of our\npersonal projects. For example, Ruehlman and Wolchik (1988) have explored the extent to which people\nin our social networks can both help and hinder the likelihood of successful project pursuit. Eve's project\nof going to Ann Arbor may be frustrated by Erik's apparent disapproval, but facilitated by the fact that\nbeyond any one else, Erik has challenged her intellectually and given her the confidence to aspire well\nbeyond where she had thought possible in September. The reason we choose to undertake certain\nprojects rather than others has been approached in a very imaginative way by Ogilvie and Rose (1995)\nwho, after grappling with the difficulties of categorizing projects in terms of content, realized that\nprojects fall neatly into four categories that are rooted in classical learning theory: whether the project\nis a positive or negative goal and whether it is something that is being sought or avoided.\nOmodei & Wearing (1990) provided a clear demonstration of the relationship between the classical\nMurrayan needs, personal projects, and well-being. They had respondents rate each of their current\npersonal projects on dimensions that represented each of the major needs posited by Murray as central\nto individual differences, and found that the extent to which projects were satisfying their needs, overall\nlife satisfaction was higher. Indeed, they were able to show that need satisfaction of personal projects\nserved as an excellent proxy for overall life satisfaction ratings. Thus, Nikki may be deeply unhappy at\nthis point in her life because she has been unable to formulate and act upon personal projects that\nsatisfy some of her most important needs. Though changing the needs may be very difficult, finding 44\nprojects through which they might be met may offer greater tractability for Nikki at this stage in her life\n(Little & Chambers, 2000).\nFinally, there are also compelling theoretical reasons to see personal projects as interpenetrating with\nthe narrative level of personality theory and research. Sarbin (1996), in tracing through the importance\nof cultural myth and its impact on lives, suggests that tragically conceived projects, such as terrorist\ncampaigns, may derive their motivational force from the myths to which children are exposed from an\nearly age, and which are reinforced by media attention and the collective stories about heroes and\nvillains which saturate our cultural landscape. Under such a view, and depending on one's belief\nsystems, another Adam's project (\"Do not eat that Apple\") may be seen as a generative proto-project of\nhumankind.\nThe Prospects for Personology: Consolidating the Integrative Center in Psychology\nIt should be apparent that I feel that the field of personality psychology is an exceptionally exciting place\nin which to take up permanent residence. I see its aspiration to provide the integrative center for\npsychology as a continuing challenge. The three levels that we have discussed in this chapter, will, I\nbelieve, continue to grow in importance and yield insights that will advance both theoretical\nunderstanding and applications in fields such as clinical, health, and organizational psychology. So too,\nundoubtedly, will the personologists in the basement continue to expand our understanding of the\nremote roots of human conduct. In addition to these, I think there are five areas that deserve to be\npromoted to positions of importance in our collective research agenda.\nFirst, I think there are rich possibilities for expansion of our understanding of the biological base of\npersonality traits, particularly given the rapid advances in techniques for monitoring brain activity on-\nline. Though there is a fairly substantial research literature on the neurophysiological substrates of\nextraversion and neuroticism, work on the rest of the big five dimensions is still in the early stages.\nRecent advances in the neurobiology of temperament (with its own Big Three factors) seems particularly\npromising (Clark & Watson, 1999).\nSecond, I think that non-human studies of personality, particularly among the higher primates, but\ninvolving a whole range of species, will pay very rich dividends in understanding how evolutionary forces\nhave shaped human personality. There are already signs that an emerging animal personality psychology\nresearch agenda is well under way (Gosling, in press). Given my conviction that project pursuit is an\ninherently mammalian propensity, I do not see such research as restricting itself to trait-like behaviors.\nExtended sets of salient activity in the pursuit of valued goals applies to Nikki's cat as well as Nikki. While\nwe will never be able to herd either Nikki or her cat, I think the comparative psychology of\nunpredictability is itself an intriguing focus for collaborative research between ethologists and\npersonality psychologists.\nThird, particularly at Level II, I believe there is considerable scope for expanding personality psychology's\nintellectual collaboration with the fields of ethical philosophy, legal theory, and the philosophy of action\n(Little, 1987, 1999a). Scholars in these areas are already grappling with questions of how the nature of\nour ground projects or core tasks bear upon issues of ethics and of different conceptions of justice. (For\na compelling treatment of such issues see Nussbaum (1992). Nussbaum looks at various Hellenistic\nphilosophies through the eyes of Nikidion--a probably fictitious student of Epicurus, who is seeking\ninstruction on living a flourishing life. Nikki in the present chapter is a modern descendent of Nikidion.\nSome day I hope to take her on a more extensive trip through what contemporary personality 45\npsychology can say about human flourishing.) I believe that such discourse will be enriched by the\nimportation of empirical work of personality psychologists, and that our work will be enriched by the\nconceptual precision afforded by philosophical inquiry.\nAs one example of this kind of interdisciplinary analysis, I have recently been exploring the concept of\nfree traits, which I see as trait-like behavior carried out in the service of a personal project even though\nit may run against one's \"first nature\". For example, some of us are \"pseudo-extraverts,\" by which I\nmean we are Eysenckian introverts who, because of professional duty or love, act extravertedly in order\nto accomplish valued goals. I believe such apparently disingenuous behavior can extract a toll on the\nautonomic nervous system and that this can lead to burn out. However, such a consequence can be\nmitigated by the availability of restorative niches in which we can, every now and then, indulge our first\nnatures ( Little, 1999b, 2000a). One of the intriguing questions raised by such an analysis (which\nintegrates research from Levels I and II), is whether such disingenuous behavior is, in fact, a \"bad thing\"\n(not only in the sense of possibly being stressful, but in terms of being unnatural, even phony). If Adam\ndecides to go back to the family business and forego grad school, how should we think about the\ntradeoff between fidelity to family and honesty to oneself? Clearly these are questions of value that can\nnot be exclusively adjudicated by empirical inquiry. But I strongly believe they can be informed by such\ninquiry, and personality psychologists are ideally positioned to provide precisely the kind of rich textured\ninformation about the complexities of people's lives.\nFourth, I believe the narrative perspective in personality will continue to flourish and I hope that the\ntraditional ways of getting individuals to tell their stories will be enriched by adoption of new\ntechnologies and methodologies. For example, simply asking individuals to tell about their daily lives by\nproviding us with images and captions from an imaginary videotape (called an idio-tape machine),\nallows individuals some adaptive flexibility in bringing into conceptual focus concerns and elements of\nemotional significance to them (Little, 2000a). Similarly, just as computing science and cognitive\npsychology have proceeded in virtual lock step, I believe that the field of personality can benefit from\njoining forces with the \"New Media\", including the imaginative use of interactive multi-media to assist\nindividuals in exposing and exploring their personal wishes, needs, projects, traits, and life narratives.\nFor example, Nikki has been depicted throughout this essay as someone who has pain beyond words.\nPerhaps by using media that do not rely solely upon words, she will be able to construct images and\nscenarios with greater richness and precision. Such multimedia meditations might help her both express\nand expunge some of that hurt.\nIf students ask me if I think they should pursue graduate work in personality psychology, I usually\nschedule two meetings. In the first meeting I tell them that I cannot think of a more fascinating area of\nresearch and proceed to tell them much of what has been compressed into this chapter.\nThey occasionally ask me how I got into the field of personality psychology. Depending on how much\ntime they have to indulge what I call my \"anecdotage\", I tell them the following. I have long felt a strong\nattraction to both the humanities and the biological sciences, with classics and microbiology being\namong my favorite undergraduate courses. When it came time to choose a major, psychology seemed\nto be the most likely field in which I could maintain a joint focus on ions and Ionians. Though I had\noriginally been accepted at Berkeley to study neuropsychology, a chance event in the library just prior to\nleaving for graduate school launched me on another trajectory. I was searching for a book called the\nStereotaxic Atlas of the Brain when I accidentally pulled down a wayward copy of George Kelly's\nPsychology of Personal Constructs. I leafed through the first few pages, developed a very severe\nintellectual itch and have been scratching it ever since. I do not recommend to my students that they 46\ntake this random walk through the stacks as a strategy for choosing their specialties in psychology,\nthough it is an honest account of how our professional lives can sometimes wind their ways along\nunpredictable paths (Bandura, 1982).\nIn the second meeting, I am usually rather more cautious. Personality psychology is a fundamentally\nintellectual pursuit--it is concerned with themes that go back to antiquity and challenges its serious\nstudents to ponder issues that cut across the full spectrum of the humanities and sciences. I point out\nthat if the student's overriding concern is with a particular practical problem, such as abuse or\ndepression or occupational success or criminal behavior, then that student should seriously consider\ngoing into an applied field such as clinical or organizational psychology. But if they are interested in how\nall of these disparate phenomena are linked together, then they may well have found an intellectual\nhome. We usually discuss where the strong programs are in personality psychology and I direct them to\nthe splendid website called the Personality Project run by Bill Revelle at Northwestern. I am also\ndelighted as of a few months ago, to be able to direct them to the Association for Research in\nPersonality website and urge them to join the Association immediately. The philosophy and sense of\nexcitement for the personality field in this new Association overlaps exactly with my own and I see it as\na major source of stimulation and support for the field in the future.\nIf the student comes back for a third meeting, I know that the line of succession from Freud, Murray,\nAllport, Kelly, and all the secular saints of personology will likely remain unbroken. But if that particular\nstudent doesn't come back, I can take some solace from knowing that there are three other students\nwaiting outside at this very moment. They want me to go have a coffee with them in the cafeteria and\nchat about grad school. In fact there's loud banging on my door even as I wrap up this chapter. Hang on,\nNikki, I'm coming.\nReferences\nBaldwin, M.W., Carrell, S. E,. & Lopez, D.F. (1990). Priming relationship schemas: My advisor and the\npope are watching me from the back of my mind.

Hence, it is appropriate to reflect on the many changes that have, and will,\ncome to pass in I/O Psychology's next century. It is clear to see that trying to adapt to the current work\nworld and apply psychological concepts is a demanding and fast-changing task for researchers,\npractitioners, consultants, and academicians alike. However, these same issues also offer us a glimpse of\nwhat I/O psychologists are likely to face in the next 15 years. Business guru, Peter Drucker (1993) has\nillustrated how every few hundred years the world undergoes a very sharp, discontinuous, and dramatic\ntransformation that completely changes the fundamental state of humankind. Industrial/organizational\npsychology (and likely the world) is in the beginning of one of those transformations. The next century\nwill be one of unprecedented change, but one that can be partially predicted by examining current\ntrends. Perhaps Paul Muchinsky (2000) said it best when he stated, \"The axiom that 'the best predictor\nof the future is the past' may have to be modified in the next century, at least as it applies to I/O\nPsychology. A few caveats or modifiers may be in order, such as 'the best predictor of the future is\nthe very recent past'\" (pg. 503). In the following pages we explore the current hot topics and future\ntrends and where they may take I/O Psychology in the next quarter-century. Students interested in I/O\nPsychology should consider researching these areas more thoroughly to be on the \"cutting edge\" of the\n21st century as it happens.\nWhat's Hot in Industrial/Organizational Psychology\nThe field of I/O Psychology can be roughly divided into seven primary areas of research: personnel\nselection, training, performance appraisal, leadership, work motivation, work attitudes, and\norganizational issues. The first three areas are traditionally considered the \"I\" or Industrial Psychology\naspects, the latter four are the \"O\" or Organizational Psychology areas. Although there are a variety of\nother pertinent I/O areas that fall beyond these primary seven (e.g., environmental issues, human\nfactors, unions, compensation systems), these seven main areas effectively make up the bulk of what\nI/O psychologists study. We explore some of the current research issues germane to each of these areas.\nPersonnel Selection\nPersonnel selection deals with measuring and predicting individual differences in behavior and job\nperformance so as to hire the best person for the job based on reliable and valid tests. Job analysis is\nalso a primary focus whereby researchers attempt to break a job down into its basic components and\ngenerate job descriptions. Perhaps one of the most widely examined areas in personnel selection is\ncompliance with the law. Increasing numbers of textbooks are devoting entire chapters to legal issues\nand selection (e.g., Cascio, 1998), and a review of some of I/O Psychology's more prestigious journals\n(e.g., Journal of Applied Psychology) finds at least one article devoted to the topic in each issue. As we\nattempt to develop screening and selection batteries for the future, not only must they be valid and\nreliable but they must also fall within current legal guidelines; this task is enormous. The size of this task\nis reflected by the following partial list of work-related laws (and highlights of the law) that I/O\nPsychologists must abide by: 53\n* The 5th, 13th, and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution (allows for \"due process\" in\nemployment-related legal hearings; abolished slavery and involuntary servitude as types of\nemployment; and all people must be given equal and fair treatment).\n* Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871 (allows citizens to make and enforce work-related contracts and sue\nwhen violated; allows citizens to sue if constitutional rights have been deprived; federal government can\nbecome involved in matters of racial discrimination in private employment settings).\n* The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (prohibits employment-related discrimination on the basis of sex in regard\nto the payment of wages; equal jobs require equal pay irrespective of gender).\n* Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII of this landmark anti-discrimination law prohibits employment-related\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; also created the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the law; later amended by the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972, the EEOC was given the power to initiate discrimination-based\nlawsuits against employers).\n* Executive Orders 11246, 11375, and 11478 (Signed in 1965, 1967, and 1969, respectively, these orders\nprohibited employment-related discrimination in the federal government; created the Office of Federal\nContract Compliance to supervise and enforce government contracts with all contractors; emphasized\nmerit-based employment practices; set the foundation for the creation of affirmative action).\n* The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) (Later amended in 1986, prohibited\nemployment-related discrimination on the basis of age but only for workers over the age of 40; allows\ncompanies the opportunity to discriminate against (i.e., fire) older employees unable to perform\nsatisfactorily if it can be proven in court that age is a problem).\n* The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (a precursor to the Americans with Disabilities Act this act required\nfederal contractors and subcontractors to actively recruit and hire people with disabilities; part of its\nintent was to prevent any systematic discrimination results in lessening an equal employment\nopportunity).\n* Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974 (prohibits employment-related discrimination on the\nbasis of being a military soldier during the Vietnam War era for all federal contractors and\nsubcontractors; essentially affirmative action for Vietnam veterans).\n* Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (prohibits employment-related discrimination on the basis of a\npregnancy or pregnancy-related condition).\n* The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (prohibits all employers from hiring or continuing to\nemploy illegal aliens and requires them to verify employment eligibility of all new employees).\n* The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (prohibits employment-related discrimination on the\nbasis of a disability; requires employers to make \"reasonable accommodations\" for disabled workers;\nrequires all new businesses to be accessible to the disabled and existing businesses to make\nimprovements in accessibility when possible). 54\n* Civil Rights Act of 1991 (alters a variety of employment-related law interpretations and practices;\nprohibits the adjustment of employment test scores on the basis of race; protects employers from\ncertain actions when advance notice was given to employees and they failed to challenge the action at\nthat time; changed legal interpretations of adverse impact in the courtroom).\n* Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) (allows for employees to be given up to 12 weeks of\nunpaid leave for births, adoptions, foster care, care of a seriously ill spouse, or care if the employee is\nseriously ill; employers must give the workers their previous job after the leave or an equivalent job;\ncompanies with 50 or fewer employees are exempt).\n* Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (prohibits employment-based\ndiscrimination on the basis of a person's affiliation with the armed services; in many instances the\nemployer must rehire a returning service member).\nAdditionally, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (for the Federal Government)\nand the Principles for the Validation and Use of Personnel Selection Procedures (developed by the\nSociety for Industrial and Organizational Psychology) are being heavily relied on by I/O practitioners and\nhuman resource (i.e., personnel) departments as a primary source of information.\nResearchers are attempting to identify which personnel selection instruments are the most predictive\nand yet do not exhibit concepts such as \"disparate impact\" (intentional discrimination) or \"adverse\nimpact\" (unintentional discrimination). For example, researchers have identified cognitive ability tests\n(i.e., intelligence tests) as being one of the most highly predictive instruments available for many jobs\n(Hunter & Hunter, 1984; Schmidt, Ones, & Hunter, 1992). Unfortunately, such tests are highly prone to\nadverse impact with minorities often scoring a half or whole standard deviation below whites on these\ntests (Hunter & Hunter, 1984). Schmitt, Rogers, Chan, Sheppard, and Jennings (1997) attempted to\ncombine alternative predictors with cognitive ability tests in hopes of creating a higher validity with\nlower adverse impact using multiple correlation. The results showed that the use of additional\npredictors (i.e., biodata, personality tests, and structured interviews) in combination with cognitive\nability tests increased validity and reduced adverse impact; however, adverse impact was still\nsufficiently high to be considered discrimination. Researchers will continue to try and find that elusive fit\nbetween high predictiveness and low discriminatory value within legal limits well into the next century.\nI/O Psychology students will need to be considerably more legal-minded as additional laws and court\ncases further expand the ever-growing body of employment legislation.\nTraining\nTraining is big business. Each year, roughly 30 billion dollars is spent on formal training programs and an\nadditional 180 billion dollars is spent on informal \"on the job\" training (Schultz & Schultz, 1998).\nAlthough much of the training literature deals with traditional topics (e.g., what are the best types of\ntraining programs, how does training knowledge and behavior transfer to the job, how can learning be\nimproved, etc.), a currently hot topic is the advent of diversity training. Whereas most training programs\ninvolve teaching an employee a particular skill or behavior to enhance job performance, diversity\ntraining is really more about re-training peoples' attitudes, prejudices, and stereotypes (and the\naccompanying behaviors). Many global (i.e., international) companies take diversity training a step\nfurther to include educating their employees on the cultures of other countries when they will be\ndealing extensively with foreign organizations. According to Noe and Ford (1992), the goal of diversity\ntraining is to reduce attitudinal barriers that constrain employee performance on the job, reduce 55\norganizational effectiveness, and limit personal development. Currently, there is little research that\nilluminates the success of this type of training. Rynes and Rosen (1995) found that less than one-third of\ncompanies even bother to evaluate the success of the training programs or conduct some type of\nfollow-up research. Given the changes that are expected in the demographic make-up of the work\npopulation in the next 15 years alone, it is important that researchers develop effective diversity training\nprograms or we are likely to see increased problems in employee interactions. According to the\nAmerican Psychological Society (1993), by the year 2000, almost 30 percent of new workers entering the\nlabor market will be minorities and almost two-thirds will be women. Nemetz and Christensen (1996)\nexamined anecdotal evidence from diversity training programs and found that many programs actually\ncreate negative reactions in participants. Furthermore, participants often felt that these \"politically\ncorrect\" interventions were done only for corporate appearances without addressing real diversity\nissues. I/O psychologists have their work cut out for them.\nLeadership\nAlthough, leadership is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O Psychology, it lacks firm\n\"conclusions.\" Consider all the different competing theories that exist: trait theories, behavioral\ntheories, situational theories, contingency theories, normative theories, power/influence theories, and\nleader-member relationship theories. Meindl and Ehrlich (1987) proposed that a theory of leadership\nmay not even really exist at all. Hence, it is not surprising that researchers cannot agree on a good\nformal definition of leadership. As Jewell (1998) so eloquently states, \"Perhaps 'leadership' is akin to the\nLoch Ness monster phenomenon: We believe that there is something big, mysterious, and powerful out\nthere, we have a rough idea of where to look, and we have launched some elaborate and expensive\nexpeditions. But hard evidence remains sparse, and the pictures we have managed to obtain are fuzzy\"\n(pg. 530). Nonetheless, researchers strive to get a handle on the concept.\nCurrently, leadership theorists are experimenting with variations to create a sort of \"new age\"\nleadership. Yukl (1994) proposed a multiple linkage model that identifies six key components (e.g.,\nmaterial resources, direction on the project, coordination of the unit) necessary for a work unit to\nfunction. The leader is the individual who provides the work unit with these components or\ncompensates for them in some way when missing. Clearly, this theory draws from many theories. So far\nthe initial research is scarce but encouraging (Kim & Yukl, 1995). Sims and Manz (1996) are working\ntogether on the development of a \"superleadership\" theory. These authors argue that superleadership\noccurs when a leader becomes an effective self-leader and then passes on these leadership skills to his\nor her subordinates turning them into self-leaders. However, it would appear that what is needed is a\n\"super\" theory of leadership that combines important elements from the existing theories to create a\nmeta-theory of leadership; unfortunately, few researchers seem interested in pursuing this research\navenue. Ardent I/O Psychology students should consider taking up this pursuit of the elusive leadership\nmeta-theory.\nWork Motivation\nLike leadership, work motivation is inundated by theories, hence, future efforts will endeavor to\nintegrate multiple theories into a single meta-theory, such as Klein's (1989) control theory model. Kanfer\n(1991) has identified three of the most viable integrative approaches for the amalgamation of work\nmotivation theories. However, there is an emphasis on exploring new variables associated with the most\nwidely researched and best supported theory of motivation, goal-setting theory (Dipboye, Smith, &\nHowell, 1994). Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Ahearne (1997) are examining the moderating effects of goal 56\nacceptance on group productivity and group cohesiveness. Their research identifies the need for groups\n(and individuals) to accept work goals in order to increase motivation and hence productivity. Recent\nwork by Phillips and Gully (1997) using structural equation modeling (LISREL) examined numerous\nvariables in relation to goal-setting theory. The authors look at self-efficacy, need for achievement, locus\nof control, and goal orientation to provide a revised model for understanding how goal-setting works.\nFinally, VandeWalle and Cummings (1997) examined how individual differences in goal orientation\naffected feedback-seeking behaviors in participants. An employee's predisposition towards certain goals\nmay have a pronounced impact on what types of motivational techniques will be used and which ones\nwill be successful.\nWork Attitudes\nJob satisfaction has always been the predominant attitude researched in this area; Spector (1996) found\nthat by 1991, over 12,400 published research studies focused on job satisfaction. Job satisfaction has\nbeen correlated with performance, pay, turnover, absenteeism, health and stress, life satisfaction,\neducation, sex, race, and age to name some of the more common correlates. However, more recent\nresearch endeavors have shifted towards measuring job involvement and organizational commitment\n(Keller, 1997). In the 1990s, organizational commitment became a hot topic.\nAlthough strongly related to job satisfaction, organizational commitment (OC) is a distinct concept that\nrelates to an employee's desire to remain with a company out of a sense of loyalty, emotional\nattachment, and financial need (Meyer, Allen, & Smith, 1993). Additional research (e.g., Irving, Coleman,\n& Cooper, 1997) found strong support for this model and will likely spur more research endeavors. Of\nparticular interest to researchers are which variables lead to an increase in organizational commitment.\nAlthough job satisfaction is considered a dominant topic, organizational commitment may be of more\nimportance to employers. Any factors which increase both job satisfaction and organizational\ncommitment are likely to be hot topics. Of course, it is presumed that employees higher in\norganizational commitment will be more productive, however, this relationship has yet to be shown,\nand an interesting dilemma will develop if employees who are high in OC are not more productive when\nit comes time to give promotions.\nThe classic nature vs. nurture controversy is a fundamental issue surrounding job satisfaction. Several\nstudies have suggested that job satisfaction may have a genetic basis (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal, &\nAbraham, 1989; Bouchard, Arvey, Keller, & Segal, 1992; Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal, & Davis, 1992).\nThese data generated several theories associated with measuring job satisfaction, the most notable of\nwhich involved positive and negative affectivity (i.e., the dispositional tendency towards positive or\nnegative emotional states). George (1989, 1991) found strong correlations between affectivity and\nemotional moods as well as job satisfaction. However, not all researchers are convinced that the genetic\nversion is the right approach. Cropanzano and James (1990) are outspoken critics. Likewise, a study by\nHershberger, Lichtenstein, and Knox (1994) involving 540 pairs of twins failed to find a significant genetic\ninfluence on job satisfaction. Most recently, Steel and Rentsch (1997) examined the stability of job\nsatisfaction ratings over a 10-year interval. Using multiple regression they determined\nthat both dispositional and situational factors accounted for portions of the variance in satisfaction\nratings. This controversial theme will be continue to generate studies from both hereditary and\nenvironmental supporters. I/O Psychology students should recognize that a comprehensive knowledge\nof basic and applied psychology is necessary to explore many work-related issues.\nOrganizational Issues 57\nThis area is quite broad, encompassing topics such as organizational behavior, organizational\ndevelopment, organizational structure, organizational theory, and organizational change. Although\nmany tangential workplace issues such as humor, violence, and spirituality are finding their way into the\npublished literature, perhaps the two most pervasive topics currently dominating psychological research\nin organizations are sexual harassment and citizenship behaviors.\nThe Equal Opportunity Commission (1980) identified two types of sexual harassment: (a) quid pro\nquo sexual harassment which involves mandatory sexual compliance in return for favors, retaining one's\njob, and/or promotions, and (b) hostile environment harassment where verbal or physical conduct\ncreates a hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment and/or interferes with an employee's job\nperformance. Much of the research since that time has focused on either different models of sexual\nharassment or how men and women's definitions and perceptions of sexual harassment differ\n(Muchinsky, 2000). For example, Gutek, Cohen, and Konrad (1990) developed a model that focuses on\nthe frequency of interactions between the two sexes. Not surprisingly, they found that sexual\nharassment occurred most often in environments where male-female interactions were high. A study on\nharassment perceptions by Hemmasi, Graf, and Russ (1994) found that superior-subordinate relations\nare more likely to be perceived as having credible (i.e., more believable) incidents of sexual harassment\nthan peer-peer relations. Further, despite recent Supreme Court rulings that harassment can occur both\nwithin as well as between the sexes, harassment directed against women is more likely to be perceived\nas harassment than harassment directed at men. Schneider, Swan, and Fitzgerald (1997) found that\neven low levels of periodic sexual harassment can have decimating physical and mental consequences\nfor the victims. These studies are very important to help researchers isolate the specific behaviors,\nperceptions, models, and terminology that will aid the courts in prosecuting and defending accused\nharassers.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum from sexual harassment are citizenship behaviors. Citizenship\nbehaviors include altruism, conscientiousness, civic virtue, sportsmanship, and courtesy (Van Dyne,\nGraham, & Dienesch, 1994). In essence, this line of research reflects employees who display \"extra\" pro-\nsocial behaviors that are neither required nor expected. Further, Moorman (1991) has found that when\nindividuals (particularly supervisors) model these behaviors, it has a positive influence on others in the\norganization. Organ and Ryan (1995) suggest that organizational citizenship behaviors unify multiple\norganizational constructs such that these behaviors may be the equivalent of what g (general\nintelligence) is at the individual level. In other words, organizational citizenship behaviors may represent\na basic foundation for several other organizationally-related characteristics. Finally, Podsakoff, Ahearne,\nand MacKenzie (1997) found that performance quantity and performance quality in work groups were\nsignificantly higher for groups higher in citizenship behaviors. Taken together, organizations may wish to\nbegin measuring and selecting individuals who score high in these job-related behaviors.\nPerformance Appraisal\nSome authors (e.g., Berry & Houston, 1993; Lowenberg & Conrad, 1998) posit that performance\nappraisal (evaluating the effectiveness of employees' job behaviors) will continue to be a key area for\nboth current and future research. I am inclined to agree with them; of all the major areas in I/O\nPsychology, the evaluation of work performance will be at the forefront, now and well into the 21st\ncentury. I highly encourage avid I/O Psychology students to become more knowledgeable with\nperformance appraisal systems and concepts as the area will continue to draw lots of attention in the\nfuture given its fundamental importance in the entire personnel system. 58\nPerformance appraisal (PA) is one of the best researched and well-defined areas in I/O Psychology. For\nexample, as early as 1980, researchers felt confident enough that they had exhausted research on PA\nrater scales and formats such that Landy and Farr (1980) proposed a moratorium on further studies.\nDespite this comprehensive analysis of PA, Jewell (1998) noted that, \"In virtually every survey ever\nconducted, both raters and ratees condemn performance appraisal practices in their organizations as\nresounding failures\" (pg. 388). As such, current research is investigating \"how\" to improve the quality of\nexisting PA systems. There are several primary avenues being pursued, including the use of multiple\nraters, 360-degree feedback systems, and rater training.\nPreliminary research on the use of multiple raters in a 360-degree feedback system appears to be\nsuperior in comparison to the traditional methods of PA which relied almost exclusively on the\nemployee's supervisor. The 360-degree system uses not only the supervisor, but also peers, self-rating\nby the employee, subordinates, and in some instances, customers/clients, outside consultants, and even\nfamily and friends. In essence, this system draws on virtually anyone who has familiarity with the\nemployee in regards to his or her job performance. Campbell, Curphy, and Tuggle (1995) led the way in\nidentifying key practices that make for a successful system such as accountability, review by superiors,\nperiodic feedback, and having a flexible system. Research by Bracken (1994) found that multirater\nsystems are reliable, valid, well-received by employees, easy to use, and job relevant. Although these\ndata are encouraging, there is still little empirical data about 360-degree feedback's effectiveness,\nmaking it a prime candidate for additional studies.\nRater training prior to the 1990s often experienced mixed reviews; some aspects of a rater's\nperformance got better, whereas other aspects became worse. This situation was often due to a debate\nover the importance of rater accuracy training versus rater error training. However, a meta-analytic\nstudy by Woehr and Huffcutt (1994) found that each of the various rater training programs has at least a\nmoderate effect on improving PA ratings, reducing rating errors and/or improving rating accuracy. Of\nthe various training programs, frame-of-reference (FOR) training emerges as the most promising. FOR\ntraining attempts to provide raters with common performance standards (references) such that each\nrater understands what constitutes good and bad performance on each relevant job dimension (Sulsky\n& Day, 1992). In essence, raters are \"calibrated\" so they agree on what behaviors and characteristics\ncomprise effective performance. Research by Day and Sulsky (1995) and Woehr and Huffcut (1994) has\nprovided initial support that FOR training increases rater accuracy across dimensions. Ideally, additional\nresearch will serve to pinpoint the most effective techniques to calibrate the raters. Given the\nparamount role that performance appraisal will play in the coming years, due in part to the increased\ndemands for personnel evaluations in a fast-paced work world, it seems appropriate to devote\nadditional space on examining the future of the field.\nThe Future of Performance Appraisal\nOf the different areas in I/O Psychology, the one that I find the most fascinating is performance\nappraisal. Although the field is quite atheoretical, this lack has not limited research in the area; for PA is\nessentially the penultimate goal of the entire personnel system. If researchers are unable to adequately\nmeasure who performs the best on-the-job (and identify the poor ones), then recruiting, selection,\ntesting, training, etc. become considerably less important.\nI became interested in the field because of critical performance appraisal=s critical nature in a personnel\nsystem. In particular, my own research has focused on how we can improve agreement among different\nrating sources by using explicit comparison standards (so that raters have a common frame-of- 59\nreference). I think that developing a comprehensive theory of performance (and PA) and increasing\ninter-rater agreement are two of the biggest challenges for PA in the future. The student of I/O\nPsychology will quickly realize that the often subjective nature of performance ratings and the lack of a\nsound performance theory are definitive obstacles for developing sound PA instruments. The following\nsection focuses on some of the important future strides in PA.\nThere are a variety of predictions that could be made concerning where PA is likely to be headed in the\nnext 15-20 years. Although such extrapolations are always tentative there are four key areas of change\nin PA research: (a) a shift to new methods, (b) changes in ways of measuring performance, (c) responses\nto the changing nature of work, and (d) the strategic counseling of organizations in PA.\nNew Methods\nOne of the biggest shifts in PA is an increasing reliance on the multirater, or 360-degree feedback\nsystem. As previously illustrated, not only is this a hot topic in I/O Psychology, but I predict this is where\nthe future of PA is headed. The multirater system has several advantages that enhance our ability to\ncreate innovative appraisal systems. For one thing, a multirater system creates a \"team\" environment\nfor providing feedback as well as increasing the awareness of all involved in the aspects of different jobs\nand their requirements. Additionally, 360-degree feedback can be customized to the individual\norganization, allowing for external and internal customers, other company representatives, and\nsubordinates. This adaptability is necessary in a work environment where people quickly move from one\nproject to another and from one company to another. Ultimately, multirater feedback systems will be\nused both for developmental purposes as well as administrative (pay, promotion, termination)\npurposes. Of course, multirater systems also require a lot of people, can be time intensive, and need the\nsupport of executive management. As such, researchers will be forced to show management and\norganizations the inherent benefits of using such a system.\nA second methodological change will be the reliance on computer technology. Some researchers and\norganizations are already adopting electronic monitoring devices to \"observe\" the performance of\nemployees and collect data. This approach goes well beyond the traditional telephone and video camera\nsystems of the past, computer technology allows organizations to record every keystroke, transaction,\nand interaction. Supervisors need not even be physically present (or even nearby) to collect the\ninformation. Through computer databases, researchers can collect enormous amounts of information\nthat relate to job performance, thus aiding in the design of new techniques and systems. Of course,\nsome critics (e.g., Hedge & Borman, 1995) argue that this approach may violate employee privacy rights,\nanother topic of concern for I/O psychologists in the next century.\nFinally, the way performance research is conducted will have to change in two significant ways. First,\nthere is a need for more longitudinal designs. The vast majority of performance appraisal publications\nrely on \"snapshot\" data that take performance appraisal ratings at a single moment in time and attempt\nto correlate them with any multitude of variables. If PA is going to move forward, it will require studies\nthat focus on performance trends over time using large cohorts of employees. However, this approach\nfaces difficulty because organizations are hesitant to allow researchers access to performance\ninformation, let alone access over a multi-year time frame that may tie up significant amounts of\nemployee time. Nonetheless, in order for PA to move forward and develop a comprehensive theory of\nperformance, researchers must focus on longitudinal studies. 60\nThe second design change will be the increased use of field studies. PA research has relied much too\nheavily on the undergraduate college students as their primary sample (Banks & Murphy, 1985).\nAlthough student data may be generalizable in some instances, often the differences between a full-\ntime college student's reactions to a PA instrument and the reactions from a 40-year department\nmanager are miles apart (Ilgen & Favero, 1985). Academicians must make the effort to conduct more\nstudies at the job site. Organizations must be educated to understand the overall \"big picture\" on why\nsuch research is necessary and the advantages it can offer in improving PA systems.\nMeasurement of Performance\nThe way we define performance is changing beyond the simple mastery of individual efforts and\nassigned tasks (May, 1996). The individual is clearly being replaced by the team; many employees now\nfunction as part of a work team with additional demands beyond their individual set of capabilities (e.g.,\nconflict management, communication skills, and collaboration). Given that these skills and abilities are\ncritical for group and organizational effectiveness, we can no longer measure only the individual. We\nmust develop new measures and instruments that measure \"group\" job performance without losing\naccountability for the individual. These measures must take into consideration the subtle interactions\nbetween members required for a team to function effectively. For example, do certain personality types\n(e.g., Type A, high self-confidence, low authoritarian) work better together as a team (or alone)? Also,\nhow do we compensate teams as opposed to individuals and still keep individuals team-focused?\nPerhaps the areas of team athletics and the military will serve as a beginning model for such\ndevelopments.\nAnother measurement concern has to do with the organizational \"fit\" of a potential employee. No\nlonger will it be sufficient to simply determine if the job applicant has the necessary skills to do the job,\nbut also, whether the applicant fits well into the organizational culture. We must be able to measure\nboth organizational culture and the person and know which combinations lead to enhanced\nperformance (Huszczo, 1996). Ultimately, we need to know what are the best types of organizational\ncultures for particular individuals to thrive in; this approach creates an interesting dilemma if our best\nperforming applicant/incumbent is not a good fit in our organizational culture. Given that organizational\nvalues help influence the importance of performance dimensions, such contextual variables will become\nincreasingly more valued in generating the organizational \"citizen.\" At the same time, I/O psychologists\nmust develop methods that show these organizational factors' measures are job relevant. Perhaps the\nmeasurement of organizational citizenship behaviors will lead the way in creating not only a proper job-\nperson fit but an organizational-person fit as well.\nChanging Nature of Work\nThe fundamental nature of work and organizations is changing at an unprecedented rate. Corporations\nare \"flattening out\" by eliminating layers of management, increasing employee responsibilities, and\nrestructuring themselves afterwards in previously unheard of configurations. One of the trends that will\nresult from this approach is that fewer individuals will be available to evaluate performance. They will\nhave less time and more non-appraisal responsibilities. Researchers must respond by exploring new\nways of measuring performance without compromising validity and reliability. Clearly, computer\ntechnology and the utilization of raters beyond the supervisor (e.g., self-ratings by the employee) will\nhelp. Furthermore, with the appearance of telecommuting, employees may not even be physically\npresent for their supervisor to observe them. Hence, Murphy and Cleveland (1995) have suggested that 61\nPA may have to change with the work, focusing more on outcomes and results than on individual\nperformance dimensions.\nOrganizational Consulting and Counseling\nThe last area of the PA future involves a combination of changing research agendas while increasing\nresearcher advocacy concerning performance appraisal. One of the responsibilities of an I/O\npsychologist, particularly a practitioner, is persuading, educating, and counseling the business world on\nthe necessities and virtues of PA. Simply developing psychometrically sound methods, tools, and\nmeasures to evaluate performance is not enough. Researchers will be forced to generate more research\nthat links PA to the strategic goals of organizations, reinforces organizational values and structure,\nprovides developmental information on the employee, and shows how PA integrates into the larger\nhuman resource system (May, 1996). In other words, we cannot rely on corporate executives to pick up\nour research journals and suddenly \"see the light\"; we must conduct research that connects PA with the\nlarger corporate picture and empirically demonstrates its inherent value.\nTaking this view one step further, researchers will be forced to become more actively involved in\n\"selling\" PA systems and research. For PA research to move forward, we need to have organizations\ncollaborating with I/O psychologists to determine what types of strategies, techniques, and\ninterventions work. Thus, research agendas will change to include the presentation of published\nliterature that demonstrates what techniques are effective in getting organizations to participate,\nunderstand, and incorporate PA into their structure.\nCurrent and Future Trends in I/O Psychology and Their Relations to Performance Appraisal\nMany researchers have identified likely trends that will affect I/O Psychology in the 21st century. These\ntrends, if accurate, will have definitive consequences for the field of I/O Psychology as well as PA in\nparticular. Knowledge and prediction of the anticipated patterns prior to their actual occurrence will\nenable the well-prepared I/O Psychologist (and student) to adjust personnel systems a priori instead\nof post hoc. Below are the predicted trends and the influences they may have on PA.\nCognitive Psychology Explosion\nThe last two decades of the 20th century witnessed an explosion of information in the area of cognitive\npsychology. This rapid growth is likely due to newer methodologies and technologies which allow\nresearchers to better examine and understand human thought processes and neurology. I/O Psychology\nhas been involved in this trend particularly as it regards social cognition, decision-making strategies,\ndesign of \"intelligent\" machines, and worker perceptions in social situations (see also Lord & Maher,\n1991; Wickens, 1993).\nUnderstanding social cognition and perception as well as decision-making processes in the work place\nwill become critical. We know that people are prone to systematic errors (i.e., biases). Whether we are\ntalking about training, selection, PA, or actual performance on the job, I/O psychologists need to have a\ndeeper understanding of how the human mind processes information, particularly the role that these\nerrors and biases play in the larger picture (Martinko, 1994). 62\nThe impact of the microprocessor and computers in the workplace cannot be overstated. These\nsophisticated machines not only allow us to model human cognition; some possess limited \"thinking\"\ncapability and can adapt to changes in the environment. However, we must also develop software and\ninterfaces that allow for human user interaction (i.e., make them user-friendly). Thus, the next quarter\ncentury will see computer technology and methodologies utilizing that technology as a common\noccurrence in the published literature.\nPA has already been significantly impacted by cognitive psychology in the redesign of methodologies\nthat focus on \"how\" raters observe, remember, organize, evaluate, and encode performance data. The\nfuture of PA and cognitive psychology likely rests on the development of more sophisticated computer\ntools that can aid people in handling vast amounts of information.\nEmpirical Emphasis on Work Behavior\nGiven the ties that I/O Psychology has to the business world, it should not be surprising that the\nbusiness world's concern with \"the bottom line\" is gradually influencing the development of\ninterventions, training programs, PA, and methodologies for the study of people at work. Organizations\nare becoming increasingly aware of the need for detailed work records, turnover and absenteeism rates,\ndocumented performance evaluations, employee suggestions and inputs, as well as customer feedback\non the company's performance.\nI/O psychologists have responded and will continue to respond in several key ways including the\ncontinued use of advanced statistical methodologies and techniques such as meta-analysis and\nstructural equation modeling. Meta-analysis is a statistical technique that has become increasingly\npopular in the I/O psychology research literature (Steiner, Lane, Dobbins, Schnur, & McConnell, 1991).\nMeta-analysis is essentially a quantitative literature review whereby a group of similar studies are\nlocated using a set of defined criteria, analyzed collectively, and an overall summary conclusion is drawn\n(thus creating an enormous N-size). For example, Iaffaldano and Muchinsky (1985) collected numerous\nstudies to examine the overall correlation between a worker's performance and their satisfaction with\nthe job. When these research studies were analyzed together, a small, but positive correlation was\nfound. Although, the positive correlation was expected, the relatively small size was not. Only by\nanalyzing hundreds of studies simultaneously were researchers able to identify the \"true\" relation\nbetween satisfaction and performance.\nStructural equation modeling (also known as covariance structure modeling) is one of the most\nadvanced and complex statistical techniques used in I/O methodologies to date (see Coovert, Penner, &\nMacCallum, 1990 for a complete review). This \"cutting edge\" tool allows a researcher to examine the\ncomplex interactions of many variables. By acquiring a measure of each of the pertinent variables,\ntesting the hypothesized, directional relationship between these variables, and determining if the\nproposed model \"fits\" the data, the researcher is provided with a \"goodness of fit\" test that suggests the\nlikelihood of the proposed model being accurate. The advantage of this technique is its ability to analyze\ndozens of variables simultaneously that may be interacting with one another. Given the complexity of\nwork behavior, structural equation modeling is likely to be a continued phenomenon in I/O psychology's\nmethodologies.\nTogether, meta-analysis, which allows the aggregation and synthesis of hundreds of PA studies, and\nstructural equation modeling, which allows for the examination and testing of complex performance\nvariable interactions, will lead the way in research methodologies. Given the constant changes occurring 63\nin the workplace and the infinite number of interactions, structural equation modeling will undoubtedly\nprove to be a more commonly used technique in the advancement of PA research.\nGroups, Teams, and Quality\nThe total quality management (TQM) movement, inspired by W. Edwards Deming, caught on in the\ncorporate world during the 1980s and has continued to present day. The fundamental core of TQM\nsuggests that organizations must become more focused on quality not quantity; high quality products\nand services are required if organizations are going to compete in a global market. One notable change\nin organizations as a result of TQM is the transformation in organizational structure and utilization of\nemployees. Employee empowerment is achieved by allowing employees and managers to work in a\nmore group or team-oriented environment.\nLow-level employees are allowed a voice in how the product should be made and ways to improve it.\nThis empowerment often extends to equipment, safety, policies, and self-management. Quality circles\nand self-managed work teams are just two of the more common names used to describe work groups\nthat meet to discuss quality-related issues and implementation of continuous, work improvement\nprograms (Omachonu & Ross, 1994; Waldman, 1994). However, the use of work teams and an emphasis\non quality creates several interesting measurement problems for I/O psychologists as illustrated earlier.\nPsychologists specializing in PA will be required to develop instruments that measure team performance\n(e.g., work groups, departments) in addition to the traditional individual measures. Thus, as indicated by\nKatzell (1994), psychologists must change their \"unit of analysis\" from the individual to the work group.\nFurthermore, PA specialists will be forced to develop instruments which can measure the \"quality\" of a\nproduct, process, or procedure.\nCultural Diversity\nSometime in the first half of the 21st century, it is projected that white males will no longer be a\nmajority in the workplace (Goldstein & Gilliam, 1990; Loden & Rosener, 1991). However, changes in sex\nand race are not the only expected changes. Significant changes in worker education, age, religious\ndiversity, career mobility, and full vs. part-time status are expected to impact the organizations of\ntomorrow.\nThe recruitment, selection, training, and retention of this diverse work world will become key to a\ncompany's survival to say nothing of the potential litigation that will follow a business that fails to keep\nup with federal mandates concerning the fair hiring of employees. Moreover, cultural diversity is not\nlimited to just typical demographic variables. The world is becoming an increasingly competitive global\nmarket where organizations must \"rub shoulders\" with companies all over the world. No longer may a\nmajor corporation be concerned only with domestic markets. As such, companies must implement new\ntraining programs to prepare their managers and employees to deal with international cultures, other\nbusiness procedures, differences in values and ethics, and relocation to new countries if necessary\n(Rothwell, 1992).\nThe challenge for I/O psychologists studying PA will be to develop rating scales, rating systems, appraisal\ninterviews and feedback, performance dimensions, and rater training to handle the diverse workgroup\nwhich will perform the work and be evaluated. Research studies have already shown that raters tend to 64\ngive more favorable rating to members who are most similar to them (i.e., race, age, sex, culture, etc.),\nalthough many studies indicate the effects are small (Saal & Knight, 1995). This situation will be\nproblematic for PA designers who not only must attempt to improve a dynamic system, but do so when\nthe employees being evaluated are becoming increasingly more diverse in behaviors, beliefs, attitudes,\nand values. Triandis, Kurowski, and Gelfand (1994) argue that roughly 50% of all Western psychology is\nuniversal, the other half is specifically a product of our Western culture. Thus, many psychological\ntheories, concepts, and techniques may have to be significantly revised for a successful PA system.\nOrganizational Downsizing\nAs defined by Freeman and Cameron (1993), downsizing is an organizational strategy aimed at reducing\na company's workforce under the assumption that it will result in enhanced competitiveness,\nproductivity, and/or efficiency. Although many researchers think that this strategy is often flawed in\nmany situations (e.g., Nagy, 1996), it is nonetheless, a strategy that will continue through the early years\nof the next century. As this downsizing trend continues, there will be many more opportunities to\nredesign organizations, jobs, departments, and systems. Allan Church (1995) has outlined several ways\nin which I/O psychologists can have an impact on the downsized organization, including PA. Those\nindividuals who do research and implement PA systems will be required to aid in the termination of\nemployees. This action requires a very well-developed PA system to decide which employees will remain\nand which employees will be terminated. Although PA is typically used to assess good, average, and\npoor performance, more advanced research will be required to adjust PA for its differential functions.\nAdvice for Future I/O Psychologists\nBased on the current and predicted trends in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, there are several\nrecommendations that I would make for anyone beginning or contemplating a career in I/O Psychology.\nFirst and foremost, any individual must have a strong, working knowledge of the field. Research and\ntheory in I/O Psychology is abundant, complex, involved, and quantitative in nature. There is no\nsubstitute for understanding such in-depth concepts as validity generalization, job analysis, assessment\ncenters, affirmative action, comparable worth, leaderless group discussion, true halo, predictive validity,\nand work samples. A graduate degree is highly encouraged because it exposes students to the most\nrecent, state-of-the-art theories, research, measures, controversies, and methodologies.\nSecond, the I/O psychologist of the future must have a firm grasp of advanced statistics. Although\ncorrelations, t-tests, and simple ANOVAs should be tools in every psychologist's arsenal, I/O psychology\noften utilizes more advanced statistical techniques, most likely associated with the larger sample sizes\nthat are germane to the field. Preferred areas of statistical specialization would include the following:\ntwo- and three-way ANOVAs and their subsequent interactions; understanding of moderator variables;\nfactor analysis; multiple regression (including stepwise, blocked, and backward techniques); structural\nequation modeling; discriminant analysis; intraclass correlations; canonical correlation; and meta-\nanalysis. The prepared I/O psychologist will need to understand the theory and proper use of these\nstatistics and be familiar with their utilization via computer software packages. Similarly, the future I/O\npsychologist will also have to develop skills in communicating the interpretations of such analyses to\nthose who lack sophistication in these statistical procedures.\nA third requirement is a sound understanding of personnel law. It is somewhat sad to say, but an\neffective I/O psychologist must almost be part lawyer. Given the ever-growing number of federal\nguidelines, mandates, and laws that relate what can and cannot be done concerning employment, I/O 65\npsychologists will find it necessary to be current on the legality of the various statistics, techniques, and\nmeasurement instruments used, and recommendations they make. Evidence of validity and reliability,\njob-relatedness, minimization of adverse impact and illegal discrimination, documentation of\norganization policy and procedures, and general compliance with the law will become mandatory.\nFailure to heed this advice may land an I/O psychologist in the midst of a sizable lawsuit or competency\nhearing.\nThe fourth recommended component of the future I/O psychologist is a good working knowledge of the\nbusiness world preferably derived from actual experience in the \"real world.\" Potential I/O psychologists\nshould seek out every opportunity to interact with companies and businesses. Whether this interaction\ntakes the form of internships, practicums, consultation, invited addresses/seminars, a business degree,\nor actual employment, practical experience in business is truly a learning necessity. I/O psychology\ncannot function apart and separate from the corporate environment; the work place is our domain. As\nsuch, no applied psychologist can be effective without sufficient field experience. Becoming a\ncommensurate liaison between the academic world and the business world will be a valuable skill.\nFinally, the future I/O psychologist must be comfortable and experienced with computer technology.\nThis competence extends beyond simply using basic computer knowledge and statistical software\npackages. Being computer literate in a variety of software programs will be necessary. Competence with\nword processors, databases, spreadsheets, mainframes, networking, graphics, and multimedia\npresentation software will be required skills. Exposure to computer classes and office software will\nundeniably be a valued commodity in the 21st century.\nIn short, the I/O psychologist of the future must be a \"jack of all trades\" (i.e., a generalist). He or she will\nbe required to be part statistician, part computer expert, part scientist, part business executive, part\nresearcher, part academician, part consultant, part lawyer, part human resources specialist, and part\npractitioner. All of these attributes must be juggled in a fast-paced, constantly changing work world, full\nof international and cultural diversity. I/O psychology will be an exciting, challenging, and heavily-relied\nupon discipline in the next century.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychological Society (1993, October).

Barth\nTexas Christian University\nCongress declared the 1990s as the \"Decade of the Brain\". The idea, I think, was to devote the nineties\nto the study of neurological and neuropsychological disorders in the hopes of finding treatments or\ncures for diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, Attention Deficit Disorder, stroke,\nhead trauma, and many others. Like so many past ventures, neuroscientists and clinicians approached\nthis challenge by blending basic and applied science in an attempt to gain a better understanding of\ndisease and discover new treatments. Progress was made. However, we find ourselves in a familiar\nsituation: the ultimate goal has not yet been achieved. We will likely move into the next century with\nthe feeling that we have been very productive, but that somehow we still have fallen short of the mark.\nWe can easily justify this state of affairs by reasoning that these are complex problems that need more\ntime for study and experimentation. Although I believe this to be an accurate assessment, I would take\nthis a step further by stating that research in the 21st Century will likely bring with it a noticeable change\nin emphasis. I believe behavioral studies of brain function and dysfunction will once again come to the\nforefront of neuroscience and that this will likely bring us closer to attaining our stated goals.\nBefore I address the issue of why I think the discipline of physiological psychology will come to the\nforefront of neuroscience, we must first consider the multidisciplinary nature of neuroscience research.\nIn order to do this, an idea from one of my former mentors, Dr. Steve Wise, comes to mind. Wise\nlikened the field of neuroscience to a chair, with each leg representing a necessary foundational field of\ninquiry. For example, one leg represents neuroanatomical research (morphological study of the brain),\nanother, neurophysiological research (the study of the electrical properties of the brain), a third,\nneuropharmacological research (the study of brain chemistry), and the fourth leg, neurobehavioral\nresearch (the study of brain-behavior relationships). He reasoned that if any of these legs were\nremoved, then the chair would fall and research would fail or stagnate.\nThe fourth leg of the neuroscience chair consists of two disciplines: physiological psychology and\nneuropsychology. Experimentation within the field of physiological psychology may be viewed as }basic\nresearch.\" Results from these studies provide foundational knowledge regarding brain-behavior\nrelationships, such as what areas of the brain are involved in learning and memory. Often there is an\nobvious application to clinical or applied issues, but the intent of the research is to reveal basic\nmechanisms. These studies usually require invasive techniques that manipulate the nervous system.\nExperimentally destroying or electrically stimulating the brain, the administration of drugs directly into\nthe nervous system, or measuring neurochemical levels from a brain area are examples of invasive\ntechniques. These procedures necessarily use animals as subjects because it is considered unethical and\nrisky to invade the human nervous system for experimental reasons.\nResearch in neuropsychology mostly focuses on applied questions, specifically those aimed directly at\nunderstanding neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., Parkinsons disease) and nervous system trauma (i.e.,\nbrain or spinal cord injury resulting from a car accident or stroke). Neuropsychological research uses\nbrain-imaging technology in conjunction with behavioral assessment. An exciting brain-imaging 72\ntechnique currently used is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This technique represents a\nnon-invasive method of visualizing the metabolic activity of brain areas while the person is engaged in\nsome cognitive or sensorimotor task. Ideally, the results from both physiological psychology and\nneuropsychology laboratories would be integrated to help us understand the behavioral side of\nneuroscience.\nIt is clear that in recent history, behavioral studies of the brain and physiological psychology have taken\na back seat to the other three disciplines. Currently, there are only a few basic science journals devoted\nto behavioral studies of brain function compared to the total number of journals devoted solely to\nneuroscience. There are roughly 50 or 60 neuroscience journals, of which perhaps less than 10 publish\npredominately behavioral studies. Even the word \"psychology\" seems to have disappeared from the\ntitles of these journals. For example, the APA journal once named The Journal of Physiological and\nComparative Psychology is now two journals, The Journal of Comparative Psychology and Behavioral\nNeuroscience. The Psychonomic Society journal Physiological Psychology is now Psychobiology. You may\nbegin to wonder if the field of psychology has become the crazy aunt kept hidden in the attic. Although I\nthink that idea might be a little extreme, I do think that experimental psychology has been speaking with\na softer voice in recent times.\nAnother recent trend is that many academic departments of psychology are hiring neuroanatomists,\nneurophysiologists, or neuropharmacologists, rather than someone trained in the basic principles of\npsychology. I believe this trend can be attributed to the development of neuroscience as a major field of\nstudy at the undergraduate level, and the desire to integrate behavioral science with the other natural\nsciences. Faculty in the departments of biology, chemistry, pharmacology, mathematics, physics, and\npsychology typically maintain neuroscience programs, so it might make sense that there would be\ncrossover hiring. If there is reason for concern, it is in the desire for the continuance of neuroscience\nresearch that integrates the basic principles and approach of experimental psychology with other\nsciences. In other words, neuroscientists must continue to engage in those very long and tedious\nbehavioral experiments that require numerous control groups and take months of data collection that\nare so typical of experimental psychology. It does not matter if this type of research is done in\npsychology, pharmacology, biology, or chemistry departments. It is the emphasis on behavioral analysis,\nexperimental design, and statistics (i.e. the training of experimental psychologists) that is important.\nThis approach is crucial, because without it the field of neuroscience will advance very slowly.\nAt the 1997 Society for Neuroscience meeting (New Orleans), there were 951 sessions, each of which\ntypically had 10-20 presentations. This data mean that there were close to 15,000 presentations at our\nannual meeting! Perhaps it will put things into perspective if I point out there were only 179 sessions\nunder the theme Neural Basis of Behavior, or roughly 2500 presentations. You can interpret these data\nin a couple of different ways. On one hand, you could say that only 17% of the research in the field\nfocuses on brain /behavior relationships. On the other, you might conclude that 2500 presentations at a\nsingle meeting certainly does not suggest a dying field. Both interpretations are probably accurate\n(There were only about 13,000 presentations at the 1998 meeting in Los Angeles, with 14 % being in the\nNeural Basis of Behavior sessions). However, I predict that research focusing on neurobehavioral\nquestions will increase dramatically over the next 15 years. I say this because in 1997 and 1998 a large\npart of the remaining presentations at the annual neuroscience meeting (i.e., those that did not include\nbehavioral analysis) suggested that the brain, and indeed the neuron, are dynamic. That is, the nervous\nsystem has the potential for change in structure, relative neurochemistry, and electrical reactiveness.\nThese dynamic events have brought to the forefront of neuroscience the idea of \"neural plasticity.\"\nWhat could these dynamic events be related to? The obvious answer is that neural plasticity is related to 73\nbehavioral plasticity. In other words, dynamic changes in the brain most likely reflect a concomitant\nchange in behavior, cognition, or emotion. For example, neural plasticity is viewed as the mechanism of\nlearning and the basis for recovery of function after brain damage. Ultimately, neuroscientists must be\nable to construct experiments that allow for correlations between neural and behavioral plasticity. One\nvery important place they will find the tools to attain this goal is in the discipline of experimental\npsychology.\nUltimately the trends in neuroscience research must lean towards behavioral or psychological studies,\nwhy has there been a relative paucity of study in the area upto this point? I think part of the answer has\nto do with our fascination for the most current technology. For example, the recent history of\nneuroscience has featured the development of high resolution brain imaging, simultaneous recording of\nsingle-neurons in various parts of the nervous system, transplantation of fetal neurons into the brains of\nadult organisms, the measurement of neurotransmitter levels in the brains of animals while they\nperform simple behaviors, more accurate techniques for counting neurons and glia in the brain,\nmethods for patch-clamping dendrites, techniques that allow for the visualization of dying neurons,\nmore accurate methods for measuring cerebral blood flow, and the list goes on and on. Technology\nallows us to do things that we never thought were possible. The development of new technology is\nexciting: it is what we call \"cutting edge\" science. However, cutting edge science does not stop here,\nbecause the impact of technological development is gauged by the how it is applied to important\nquestions. I think the current and intense interest in neural plasticity suggests that it is time for this new\ntechnology to be applied to questions about behavioral plasticity.\nAlthough the development of new technology will put you on the cutting edge, its application to the\nstudy of behavior brings with it still new and significant challenges. In his book, Brain Plasticity and\nBehavior, Bryan Kolb (1995) writes, \"Behavior is not sexy, but it is as difficult to study as molecules\" (p\n10). Kolb believes that most people think understanding behavior is a simple task. After all, most of us\nobserve the behavior of others everyday. However, to study the complexities of behavior, scientists\ncommit themselves to a tedious and time-consuming journey.\nSetting the Stage for the 21st Century\nOne example of what I consider to be sophisticated behavioral analysis may be found in the area of\nsensorimotor behavior. Whishaw and colleagues have provided a detailed analysis of forelimb and paw\nuse in a variety of rodents (Whishaw, Sarna, & Pellis, 1998) and linked these behaviors to the\ncorticospinal pathway (i.e., a neural pathway that originates in the motor cortex and terminates in the\nspinal cord). Whishaw has used the Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation (EWMN) in order to identify\nthe specific sequences of movement used in }handling\" different foods during eating. The EWMN allows\nfor behavior to be described in terms of changes in limb segments (i.e., part of the limb that lies\nbetween two joints, or a joint and the extremity) in relation to the body, the environment, or the next\nlimb segment. This type of analysis led Whishaw and colleagues to gain a better understanding of the\nnormal movement sequences used in eating and how they are changed after damage to the\ncorticospinal pathway (Whishaw & Coles, 1996; Whishaw, Dringenburg, & Pellis, 1992; Whishaw &\nGorny, 1994; Whishaw & Pellis, 1990; Whishaw, Pellis, Gorny, & Pellis, 1991). You could imagine using\nthis behavioral analysis to study the motor dysfunction of patients with movement disorders (i.e.,\nParkinsons disease, Huntingtons disease, head trauma) and the effects of various treatments (i.e., drug\nor physical rehabilitation). 74\nIn the area of cognitive behavior, much of the recent work with rodents has focused on establishing\nbehavioral dissociations among brain areas involved in memory. These studies typically attempt to link\ndifferent aspects of cognition (i.e., spatial memory, temporal memory, or attention) with specific neural\nsubstrates (i.e., hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex). To attain this goal, variations of\nstandard tests of memory (i.e., radial arm maze, Morris Water Maze, delayed nonmatching to sample,\nconditioned discriminations) have been used in very creative ways (Jackson, Kesner, & Amann, 1998;\nRagozzino & Kesner, 1999). It may take weeks or months to train animals on these tasks, create a brain\nlesion, and then test for any amnesic effects.\nA question regarding the incorporation of these techniques into a research program is }Are they worth\nthe effort?\" Recent history suggests that the majority of neuroscientists have not taken on this burden.\nHowever, this situation will change as curiosity regarding the dynamic brain increases. Could the crazy\naunt in the attic become the wise sage of the 21st century? At the very least I am confident that with the\nbeginning of the new century there will be a new emphasis on sophisticated behavioral analyses that\nwill ultimately help elucidate the nature of the dynamic changes taking place in the brain. In other\nwords, it is time for the fourth leg of the neuroscience chair to take center stage.\nSophisticated behavioral analyses will be critical if we are to accomplish the goals set by Congress with\nthe Decade of the Brain. Although understanding the neuropathology and etiology of neurological\ndisorders is essential, in the end the neuropsychologists will evaluate the effectiveness of proposed\ntreatments on behavioral grounds. Does the treatment lead to a higher quality of life for those\nindividuals affected by the disease? This question can only be answered through the study and\nmeasurement of behavior, and not with experiments that limit their scope to neuron morphology,\nphysiology and chemistry. Ideally, the 21st century will bring a true and equal marriage between\nneuroscience and behavioral science. In the case of neurological disorders, the development of new and\neffective treatments will include a more complete understanding of the behavioral syndrome and an\napplication of the current models of neural plasticity. I believe that this approach will allow us to\nevaluate the effectiveness of proposed treatments better and to understand why these treatments have\n(or do not have) beneficial effects.\nFor example, the number of accepted treatments for Parkinsons disease has expanded considerably in\nthe past five years. The need for new treatments is based on the problem that long-term drug therapy\nwith levodopa (i.e., the most widely used drug treatment) leads to a return of the Parkinsonian\nsymptoms and additional behavioral dysfunction in most cases. Two examples of new treatments are\nthe surgical procedure known as }pallidotomy\" (i.e., carefully destroying the ventral pallidum, a brain\narea found towards the bottom of the forebrain), and a new drug called }ropinirole.\" To assess the\neffectiveness of these treatments accurately, we must have a clear understanding of the behavioral\nsyndrome associated with Parkinsons disease. This understanding will allow us to determine the extent\nto which the new treatments alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, as well as if the treatments generate\nnew and unwanted behaviors or additional behavioral dysfunction. Although some researchers have\ntaken this approach and produced some positive results (Masterman, et al., 1998; Sethi, et al., 1998),\nthe future will likely bring with it a more extensive analysis of the behavioral effects of these treatments.\nAt the neural level, it is possible that plasticity has been diminished in Parkinsons patients. For example,\nsome animal studies have suggested that one area of the brain affected in Parkinsons disease, the\nneostriatum, is a region that controls the acquisition and generation of motor sequences (Aldridge &\nBerridge, 1998; Graybiel, 1998). Is it possible that one symptom of Parkinsons disease may be\ncharacterized as an impairment in motor learning? If so, the brain of the person with Parkinsons disease 75\nmay be deficient in forms of neural plasticity. This finding would be important because models of neural\nplasticity have been associated with particular chemical and electrical events that can be manipulated\nthrough the administration of drugs very different from those currently used to treat Parkinsons disease.\nThus, a more complete knowledge of the behavioral syndrome associated with Parkinsons disease (i.e.,\nthrough neuropsychological testing), combined with basic research findings regarding neural and\nbehavioral plasticity done with animals, could yield the most effective treatment strategies. Although\nresearch in this area would require knowledge of the present neural models of plasticity and\npharmacologic manipulations, the fruits of the approach would ultimately require behavioral\nassessment of treatment effectiveness.\nThe following is a review of some of the current models of neural plasticity and how they may relate to\nthe mission set forth in the Decade of the Brain. These models emphasize dynamic changes in neuron\nmorphology and synaptic activity. The first section, }Does the Brain Control Behavior or Does Behavior\nControl the Brain?,\" discusses the influence of the environment on brain morphology and function. For\nexample, what are the effects of an enriched environment on brain anatomy and behavior? Does an\nenriched environment increase neural and behavioral plasticity? I also introduce the idea that our\nbehavior has significant impact on brain anatomy. In the next section, the neocortex takes center stage\nas the best example of a dynamic brain. In this section, }My, What a Dynamic Cortex You Have!,\" I\ndiscuss changes in the physiology of the cortex following sensory and motor experience. In the final\nmodel, I outline how behavioral experience may affect the communication between neurons. }The\nSynapse is a Two-Way Street\", outlines new developments in neuronal communication and how they\nmight reveal the neural mechanism of learning. After discussing these models of neural plasticity, I will\nfocus on the study of recovery of function following brain damage, the possibility that magnesium\nsupplements could prove to be beneficial, and demonstrate how some of these principles can be applied\nto a detailed behavioral analysis. I will conclude with some thoughts on future directions that combine\nphysiological psychology, neuroscience, and neuropsychology.\nSome Recent Advances in Neural Plasticity\nDoes the Brain Control Behavior or Does Behavior Control the Brain?\nConsider the following scenario. Al and Pete die at about the same age and leave their brains to science.\nThey were roughly of the same height and weight. When the two brains are compared, it is discovered\nthat Al has a heavier brain with a thicker neocortex. What is a possible reason for this difference? You\nmay be surprised to find out that the differences in brain weight and cortical thickness are probably due\nto the growth of dendrites and increased number of glia in Al's brain. It is almost certainly not due to a\nlarger number of neurons. Moreover, the differences in brain size are likely due to individual differences\nin their environment. That the morphology of neurons and number of glia have the potential for change\nis not a new concept. In fact, experiments done in the 1960s and 70s by Rosenzweig and colleagues\nsuggested that being reared in an enriched environment can lead to differences like those described in\nthe scenario with Al and Pete (Bennett, Diamond, Kretch, & Rosenzweig, 1964; Diamond et al., 1966;\nDiamond, Lindner, & Raymond, 1967; Globus, Rosenzweig, Bennett, & Diamond, 1973; Rosenzweig,\nBennett, & Diamond, 1972a; 1972b; Rosenzweig, Kretch, Bennett, & Zolman, 1962). More recent studies\nindicate that a relatively short period of exposure (i.e., 4 days) to the enriched environment may be\nsufficient to produce some of these morphological changes (Wallace, Killman, Withers, & Greenough,\n1992). 76\nIn the studies by Rosenzweig and others, researchers put infant rats into \"enriched environments\"\nwhere they had opportunities to interact with other rats, toys, bridges, and ladders. These environments\npromoted social interaction, exploratory behavior, and the development of motor skills; they also\nproduced anatomical changes in several brain areas---the most dramatic appeared to be in the\nneocortex. Gross physical changes in the neocortex included increased length, thickness, area, and\nweight. Given these changes it is somewhat surprising that relative neuronal density was actually\ndecreased when compared to control rats. In contrast, the density of glial cells was actually increased\nalong with the diameter of capillaries (Diamond, Kretch, & Rosenzweig, 1964; Sirevaag & Greenough,\n1987; Szeligo & Leblond, 1977). Moreover, increases in the extent of dendritic branching (Greenough,\nVolkmar, & Juraska, 1973; Holloway, 1966; Volkmar & Greenough, 1972) and the number of dendritic\nspines (Globus et al, 1973) were found in rats reared in the complex environment. This latter finding\nsuggests that there might also be an increase in the number of synapses, a result verified in later studies\n(Bhide & Bedi, 1984; Turner & Greenough, 1983). However, more recent data suggest that although the\nnumber of dendritic spines is increased, the spine density actually decreases (Kolb, 1995). Thus,\nalthough the number of synapses per neuron may actually increase, these synapses are farther apart.\nThe animal research data suggest the brain reacts to the environment in ways that indicate an increase\nin neural plasticity. The next question is whether there are any data that suggest this increase in neural\nplasticity translates into a correlated change in behavioral plasticity. In other words, does being reared\nin an enriched environment translate into a behavioral advantage? The answer to this question may be\nfound in a convent in Mankato, Minnesota. The now famous Sisters of Mankato constitute a remarkable\nfield study with far-reaching implications. Some of the nuns living in the convent have chosen to\nchallenge their minds even as they grow old. These nuns earn college degrees, teach, hold current-\nevents seminars, play Jeopardy, and work brainteasers. What is startling is that the nuns who have\nchosen this lifestyle are living longer and do not appear to be as susceptible to neurodegenerative\ndiseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, when compared to the general population. An exciting aspect of\nthis field study is that the nuns of Mankato have donated their brains to neuroscience. David Snowden\nof the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging at the University of Kentucky will be examining their brains in\nways very similar to those methods used in the enriched environment studies with rats. He expects to\nshow that these nuns have significantly more cortex, dendritic branching, and synapses than their\ncounterparts who have not engaged in the brain exercises. Moreover, he expects to show the \"active\"\nnuns recover better from strokes or other types of brain trauma. This result would be similar to the\nfindings that \"enriched\" rats with cortical lesions show an acceleration of recovery from either cognitive\nor sensorimotor deficits when compared to their counterparts who lived in more standard housing\nconditions (Dalyrymple-Alford & Kelche, 1987; Einon, Morgan, & Will, 1980; Gentile, Behshti, & Held,\n1987; Held, Gordon, & Gentile, 1985; Hughes, 1965;).\nAn enriched environment provides numerous novel stimuli for examination and a potential for the\ndevelopment of new motor skills. Thus, the corresponding changes in the neocortex may be due to the\nenvironment as a whole rather than any specific experience. If progress is to be made in linking the\nneuroanatomical changes to behavior, studies that focus on a specific behavioral experience are\nnecessary. Greenough and his colleagues (Greenough, Larson, & Withers, 1985) found that rats trained\nto reach for food placed in a tube showed an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the\nforelimb motor cortex contralateral to the used limb. Moreover, if both forelimbs were used in a\nbimanual task, branches in the motor cortex of both hemispheres increased (Kolb, 1995). Similar\nchanges found in the occipital cortex were found in rats trained on a complex maze (Chang &\nGreenough, 1982: Greenough, Juraska, & Volkmar, 1979). Likewise, motor skill learning (i.e. rats trained\non an obstacle course) caused an increase in the number of synapses in the cerebellum (Kleim et 77\nal.,1998). These studies suggest that specific experiences may enhance neuroanatomical plasticity.\nInterestingly enough, the dendritic changes correlated with task-specific practice are qualitatively\ndifferent from those associated with enriched environments. Exposure to the enriched environment\nreportedly causes dendritic changes in the basilar dendrites (i.e., dendrites at the base of the cell body)\nwhereas task specific changes are related to growth of apical dendrites (i.e., dendrites at the top of the\ncell body). The significance of this difference in apical vs. basilar dendritic growth is largely\nundetermined.\nThe results from the enriched environment studies, the effects of task-specific practice, as well as the\npotential data collected from the Sisters of Mankato raise an interesting and important question about\nthe brain and behavior. To what extent does behavior affect the structure, physiology, and chemistry of\nthe brain? We tend to think of the brain as a master control system, determining our actions,\nsensations, motivations, and thoughts. However, is it more accurate to suggest there is a closed loop\nbetween the brain and behavior where the brain generates behavior which in turn may cause a change\nin the brain? Kolb (1995) addresses this possibility: \" The idea that activity might change the heart or\nmuscles is seldom questioned. The possibility that behavior could change the structure and function of\nthe brain is seldom considered\" (p 5). The next frontier in neuroscience will no doubt include an intense\nexamination of this issue. This idea is elaborated in the next section.\n\"My What a Dynamic Cortex You Have!\"\nExperience not only affects the morphology of neurons, but it can also affect their physiology. Perhaps\none of the most important discoveries in the past 30 years of neuroscience research was that the\nsomatosensory and motor homunculi in the neocortex can be modified. Researchers construct the\nsomatosensory and motor representations of the body on the basis of receptive-field mapping (primary\nsomatosensory cortex) and microstimulation (primary motor cortex) studies. For example, researchers\ndetermine somatosensory receptive fields by lowering a small insulated platinum wire into the\npostcentral gyrus of an anesthetized cat, monkey, or rat and recording the electrical activity of single\nneurons while tactile stimulation is applied to different parts of the body. If the tactile stimulation\ncauses a change in the electrical activity, then the part of the body being stimulated is considered part of\nthe receptive field of the neuron. They repeat this procedure throughout the primary somatosensory\ncortex until the entire body is \"mapped.\" The primary motor cortex is mapped by sending a small\namount of electrical current through an electrode and into the precentral gyrus in an attempt to elicit\nmovement of some part of the body. The procedure is repeated until the entire body is mapped. Once\nwe thought these somatosensory and motor maps of the body were unmodifiable or hard-wired;\nhowever, now we know they are dynamic. That is, the order of the somatotopic and motor maps can be\nchanged, a phenomenon called cortical reorganization.\nThe malleability of the sensory map in the primary somatosensory cortex has been shown using several\ndifferent manipulations. Perhaps the first demonstration of cortical reorganization was in response to\ndeafferentation. For example, we know there is a part of the primary somatosensory cortex that\ncorresponds to the ring finger. What happens to the cortical map if the ring finger is amputated?\nBecause there is no longer a finger present to send sensory information into the nervous system and\neventually the cortex, does the \"ring finger area\" simply go silent or does it somehow change?\nMerzenich and colleagues showed that if peripheral sensory nerves are damaged or if a digit was\namputated, there was a change in the organization of the somatosensory cortex (Merzenich & Kaas,\n1982; Merzenich et al., 1983a,b, 1984). Specifically, the once ring finger area of the somatosensory\ncortex may respond to tactile stimulation of another finger. In other words, the receptive fields of 78\nneurons in the somatosensory cortex have changed in response to the alteration of sensory information.\nChen, Corwell, Yaseen, Hallet, & Cohen (1998) reported similar results have recently been reported in\nhuman. amputees. In another example, Jenkins, Merzenich, Ochs, Allard, & Guic-Robles (1990) trained\nowl monkeys on a task that produced repeated tactile stimulation of the fingers Subsequent mapping of\nthe hand representation in the primary somatosensory cortex revealed an expansion of the finger areas\nstimulated in the task.\nA similar result can be found in the primary motor cortex. For example, when Sanes, Suner, & Donoghue\n(1990) damaged the motor neurons that control whisker movement in rats, microstimulation of the\nwhisker motor cortex area elicited movements of other muscles in the face indicating reorganization. In\nanother experiment, Nudo, Jenkins, and Merzenich (1990) repeatedly stimulated the forelimb\nrepresentation in the motor cortex of adult rats. The microstimulation elicited movement of the\nforelimb and eventually expanded the cortical representation.\nThe potential for reorganization in the neocortex of laboratory animals appears to be relevant for\nunderstanding brain-behavior relationships in humans. For example, Pascual-Leone and colleagues\n(1993) demonstrated that blind participants, who were well-trained in Braille, had an expanded finger\nrepresentation in the hemisphere opposite to the \"reading\" hand (1993). In contrast, blind participants\nwho did not use Braille often, showed no expansion. Researchers measured the size of the\nrepresentation by using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation. In a second study using the same\ntechnique, Cohen et al. (1997) showed that people who were blind from birth demonstrated a\nsomatosensory representation of the hand in the visual cortex! Thus, it is becoming clear that behavioral\nexperience can have a strong influence on the morphology and physiology of the neocortex.\nThe Synapse is a Two-way Street\nIn the late 1940s D.O. Hebb argued that the neural basis of learning and memory would include the\nfacilitation of synaptic activity. Hebb talked about \"strengthening\" synaptic activity through\n\"reverberating\" neural circuits triggered by a repeated experience. In the 1970s, the phenomenon of\nlong-term potentiation (LTP) was discovered (Bliss & Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss & Lomo, 1973).\nResearchers demonstrated that synaptic transmission is facilitated when it is preceded by intense high-\nfrequency stimulation of the presynaptic neuron. For example, let us say you record the electrical\nresting membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron and it is -70 mV. A low-level electrical\nstimulation of the presynaptic neuron causes a change in the postsynaptic membrane of about 5 mV.\nWe know that this change in the postsynaptic membrane potential is due to the interaction between\nneurotransmitter being released by the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic receptors. LTP occurs if\nthe presynaptic membrane is given an intense tetanic stimulation, and is manifested by a greater change\nin the postsynaptic membrane potential when the low-level stimulation is once again given. Following\ntetanic stimulation, the low-level electrical stimulation now causes a change in the postsynaptic\nmembrane of about 8 mV. This \"potentiated response\" may last for hours, days, or weeks (Racine,\nMilgram, & Hafner, 1983). It is important to realize that in order for LTP to occur there must be the co-\noccurrence of electrical activity in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. That is, there must be an action\npotential in the pre-synaptic neuron that leads to a change in the electrical membrane potential of the\npost-synaptic neuron. LTP appears to be similar to the \"strengthening\" of synapses first discussed by\nHebb almost 30 years prior to its discovery. Moreover, LTP is currently believed to be a synaptic basis for\nlearning and memory. You can imagine that an experience or behavior that is repeated over and over,\nmay lead to the same potentiation of synaptic activity observed after tetanic electrical stimulation. Thus, 79\nthe facilitated synaptic response may be the basis for a change in behavior (i.e., a learned response) or\nrecollection of some event (memory).\nHow the potentiated response comes about in LTP? According to Hebb, strengthening a synapse\nrequires a reverberating neural circuit. This view may imply that signals are sent in both directions\nacross the synapse. The traditional model of communication between neurons is that an action potential\nis triggered at the axon hillock and is transported down the axon to the axon terminal without\ndiminishing in strength. After the action potential arrives at the terminal, calcium enters and\nneurotransmitter is released into the synapse. The neurotransmitter moves across the synapse until it\ninteracts with postsynaptic receptors. The interaction between neurotransmitter and receptor causes a\nlocal change in the electrical potential of the postsynaptic neuron. This local change is \"graded\" because\nit diminishes in strength as it moves toward the cell body and hillock. Local changes at different receptor\nsites are summated together in the cell body, and if there is enough of a change in the electrical\nmembrane potential, then an action potential is fired and the process starts all over again. An important\npart of the traditional model is that information moves away from the \"sending\" or presynaptic neuron\nand towards the axon hillock of the \"receiving\" or postsynaptic neuron. Recent evidence suggests that\nthis scenario, although logical and relatively easy to understand, greatly oversimplifies what is occurring\nat the level of the synapse. Moreover, the recent evidence may help us to understand how LTP comes\nabout.\nThere is recent evidence that nitric oxide (a soluble gas) might serve as a retrograde messenger across\nthe synapse allowing for the reverberating activity theorized by Hebb. Some of the neurons that contain\nreceptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate allow for the entry of calcium into a cell when activated\n(e.g., the glutamate receptor called NMDA [N-methyl-D-aspartate]). It appears that the influx of calcium\ncauses the release of nitric oxide from the postsynaptic membrane back into the synapse and onto the\npresynaptic axon terminal. Because nitric oxide readily diffuses through a cell membrane, it is possible\nthat the retrograde message leads to a \"strengthening\" of synaptic activity. Indeed, if nitric oxide is\nprevented from leaving the postsynaptic membrane, then LTP cannot be maintained for more than 1\nhour (Haley, Wilcox, & Chapman, 1992).\nThe evidence for nitric oxide as a retrograde messenger is surprising. However, what is even more eye-\nopening is the possibility that action potentials may work backwards from the cell body to the dendrites.\nUsing a patch-clamping method on dendrites, Stuart and Sakmann (1994) showed that once an action\npotential is triggered in the traditional way, there is a back-propagation of the signal to the dendrites in\nsome neurons. Patch-clamping uses smooth edged, tiny electrodes that press up against the cell\nmembrane and allow for the recording of electrical activity at various locations along the neuron\nwithout damaging it. This event may trigger the release of a retrograde messenger such as nitric oxide. If\nthis is the case, then the postsynaptic neuron is essentially \"telling\" the sending neuron that indeed it\nhas just fired a neural impulse. Indeed, the reverberating circuit once proposed by Hebb now has a\nmechanism by which neuronal communication can go in both directions and cause a \"strengthening\" or\nfacilitation of the synaptic activity.\nAlthough the demonstration of LTP and the possibility that nitric oxide works as a retrograde messenger\nare thought to be major discoveries that validate the ideas of Hebb, the behavioral significance of these\nevents remains largely undetermined. Attempts at studying the relationship between LTP and behavior\nhave mostly relied on correlational studies. For example, Morris, Halliwell, & Bowery (1989) have\nsuggested that LTP is the basis for spatial memory because drugs that block the action of glutamate at\nNMDA receptors block both the induction of LTP and the acquisition of a spatial memory task. Other 80\nexamples include the facilitation of LTP via neural pathways that do not utilize the NMDA receptor\n(Buonomano & Merzenich, 1998; Racine & Trepel, 1997; Williams & Johnston, 1998). This finding may\nbe important because it suggests there may be multiple memory systems, each having a different neural\nbasis (Baudry, 1998).\nAn important test of the relationship between LTP and behavioral learning would be to show that during\nthe acquisition of the learned response there is a facilitation of synaptic activity. For example, a\nrelationship between LTP and spatial memory has been proposed because there appears to be a\ncommon neurochemical and neuroanatomical basis. Aspiring researchers could conduct he following\nstudies to link this physiological and behavioral process more causally. Consider the hypothesis that the\nhippocampus is an important area for both LTP and spatial memory. We know that LTP can be induced\nat synapses within this neural structure specifically at the junction between the entorhinal cortex and\nthe dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus and cells of the CA3 subfield, and the CA3 and\nCA1 subfield. A researcher could permanently implant microelectrodes into the hippocampus at one (or\nmore) of these locations in rats, and then each animal could be trained on a spatial memory task. The\nmicroelectrodes would record the electrical activity of neurons in the hippocampus while the animal is\nlearning the task. If potentiated synaptic activity is the basis for spatial memory, then as the rat learns\nthe task there should be a voltage increase in the electrical potentials within the hippocampus that\nendures for days or weeks. Moreover, both the acquisition of the spatial memory task and the increase\nin electrical activity should be blocked by the administration of glutamate blocking agents. Although\nparallel neurophysiologic, pharmacologic, and behavioral studies have suggested these predicted results\n(Brown, Chapman, Kairiss, & Keenan, 1988; Castro, Silbert, McNaughton, & Barnes, 1989; Skelton,\nScarth, Wilkie, Miller, & Phillips, 1987) to my knowledge there has been only one well-controlled\nexperiment establishing a causal link (Izquierdo, 1995).\nOur discussion of neural plasticity suggests the brain has the capacity for dynamic changes in cell\nmorphology, synaptic activity, and receptive-field physiology. This potential for change within the\nnervous system is truly fascinating and it opens the door for considerable research in the next century.\nThe nature of the research is what will be important. The emphasis could be on discovering the cellular\nand neurochemical basis that allows for these neural plastic changes to take place. On the other hand,\nthe future could bring to the forefront of the field the need to understand the behavioral conditions that\ndrive these changes. Are these models of neural plasticity the keys to understanding ways to enhance\nlearning or recovery of behavioral function after brain trauma or stroke? Do they provide a window that\nallows us to see what must be done in order to provide a better quality of life for the Alzheimer's or\nParkinson's patient? These latter questions can only be answered by bringing together the current\ntechnology with sophisticated behavioral analyses. To answer these questions it will be extremely\nimportant to challenge the correlations between neural and behavioral change. There is little doubt\nabout there being sufficient motivation to continue the development of technology that will allow us to\ndemonstrate new ways the nervous system can change. However, there must also be motivation to\nmeasure the sometimes subtle changes in behavior that are the driving force behind these neural events\n(Fox, Warrington, Seiffer, Agnew, & Rossor, 1998; Gelb, Oliver, & Gilman, 1998). Now more than ever we\nshould engage in the tedious and time-consuming work of behavioral studies of brain function if we are\nto understand the significance of LTP, dendritic growth, and cortical reorganization.\nTo demonstrate this approach more clearly, I will now turn to a specific question that has been the focus\nof research in my laboratory: recovery of functions after brain injury. Researchers have made\nconsiderable progress in the last 20 years. The vast majority of progress has been in the understanding\nof what happens to the brain when there is a stroke or head-injury. We now know there is a cascade of 81\nneurochemical, cellular, and physiological events that are triggered by damage to the brain. These\nevents lead to brain damage that is secondary to the initial trauma and may continue for minutes,\nhours, days, or weeks. It is generally believed that we must develop pharmacological treatments that\nwill prevent or limit the occurrence of these events. However, does reducing the severity of these\nsecondary events lead to a restoration of function? If so, does the drug provide a long-term solution? Do\nthe treatments have beneficial effects on all behavioral aspects of the syndrome? Can pharmacologic\nintervention be harmful under certain conditions? Does drug treatment accelerate recovery of function,\ninduce recovery when none is expected, or both? Does physical or cognitive rehabilitation enhance the\neffectiveness of drug treatment? Can the models of neural plasticity described at the beginning of this\nchapter help us to understand behavioral recovery? Behavioral studies can answer these questions best.\nRecovery of Function After Brain Damage\nAn explosion of research has provided critical data on potential treatment strategies for recovery from\nbrain injury in the last ten years. Much of this research has focused on the events that follow the\ndamage and continue for hours, days, or weeks causing neurodegeneration outside the area of initial\ninjury. This \"secondary damage\" is caused by the excessive release of neurotransmitter, the\ndisintegration of cell membranes by free-radicals, swelling of the brain (i.e., edema), and disruptions in\nthe integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Because these degenerative events persist for so long after the\ninitial trauma, there is a \"window of opportunity\" within which neurons can be rescued through\npharmacological treatment with \"neuroprotective drugs.\" Although it is reasonable to assume that\nunder most circumstances rescuing these neurons will enhance recovery of function, I do not believe\nthat this is always the case. Indeed, Schallert, Jones & Lindner (1990) demonstrated that rescuing\nneurons actually had detrimental effects on behavioral recovery! Nonetheless, much research effort has\nfocused on understanding the biochemical mechanisms and the resultant anatomical effects of\nneuroprotective drugs. In contrast, researchers have done very little work to establish their effects on\nbehavioral function following brain injury. For example, one of the neurotransmitters released in excess\nafter brain injury is glutamate,one of the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitters in the central\nnervous system. In this case, neuroprotective drugs would inhibit the action of glutamate and would be\ncalled glutamate antagonists. In a recent survey of the literature since 1985, less than 50 studies could\nbe found that investigated the effects of glutamate antagonists on recovery of behavioral function\nfollowing brain damage. This number hardly reflects the \"explosion\" of research reports on the potential\nuse of glutamate antagonists for treating brain injury (Ginsberg, 1995). Behavioral measurements\nare not redundant to demonstrations of anatomical sparing; some of the few studies that reported both\nan anatomical and behavioral measure have found that although glutamate antagonists may provide\nanatomical sparing, researchers do not always observe a concurrent improvement in behavioral\nfunction (Grotta et al., 1990; Shapira, Yadid, Cotev, Niska, & Shohami, 1990). Although the\ndemonstration of anatomical sparing and control of secondary factors (i.e., edema) by glutamate\nantagonists is a fundamental step in the development of pharmacological therapies for brain injuries, it\nis essential to combine the results of such studies with a detailed behavioral assessment.\nThe Search for a Magic Pill is Clouded by Methodological Issues\nAlthough many glutamate antagonists have been synthesized as candidates for the treatment of brain\ninjury and stroke, the existing body of literature does not provide a clear picture as to which of these\nagents is most effective in facilitating recovery of function. However, MK-801, a drug very similar in\nneurochemical action to phencyclidine (PCP or }angel dust\"), is perhaps the most widely used glutamate\nantagonist in experimental studies. The lack of a candidate drug is largely due to the lack of consistent 82\nmethodology among the various reports. Factors such as the onset and duration of drug administration\nvary widely among studies. Behavioral methodologies also differ, especially along the lines of the\npostoperative observation period, the number of tests given during that time, and the onset of\npostoperative testing. Other problems with behavioral methodology include the need for quantification\nof behavioral deficits and the unfortunate practice of combining the results of several behavioral\nmeasures together in an attempt to form an index of overall neurological function (i.e., neuroscore or\nneurological severity score).\nThe postoperative observation period and the number of tests within that time may be important\nconsiderations for recovery of function experiments. In our laboratory, postoperative recovery on some\nsensorimotor tests is dependent on the number of test trials rather than the time since the brain injury\n(Barbay & Barth, 1993), whereas for other tasks the reverse appears to be true (Schallert & Whishaw,\n1984). These two variables may have played a role in the negative results with glutamate antagonists\nreported by several laboratories (DeGraba, Ostrow, Hanson, & Grotta, 1994; Follis et al., 1994; Holtz &\nGerdin, 1991; Lanier et al., 1990). For example, Follis et al. (1994) reported that two glutamate\nantagonists, MK-801 and magnesium sulfate, failed to reduce the severity of paraplegia (paralysis on\nboth sides of the body) 24 hr after rats received a stroke in the spinal cord. However, the authors note\nthat with repeated testing over a 4-day period, both treatment groups showed more recovery than\nsaline control animals. Only the magnesium sulfate group was significantly different from the saline\ngroup on the fourth day of testing. The authors point out, \"Without a doubt a longer period of\nobservation, 4 weeks for example, would have provided more definitive data and perhaps showed a\nbeneficial effect also for the MK group\" (p 231). Follis et al. also suggest that in many of the reports\nattempting to study neuroprotective effects, final observations were made between 2 hours and 7 days\n(Boast et al., 1988; Kochar, Zivin, Lyden, & Mazzarella, 1988; Yum & Faden, 1990). Although the\nimmediate effects of the drugs are undoubtedly important, it may be the case that on certain behavioral\ntasks extended postoperative testing will be required to demonstrate that significant neuroprotection\nwas observed. One standard that researchers should entertain is a postoperative testing time that\nallows the vehicle control group to return and maintain preinjury levels of performance. In this case,\nresearchers can establish any potential benefit of the drug treatment. However, in some cases where\nthe behavioral impairments are chronic or permanent, researchers should determine some reasonable\ncut-off should be established that would include at least 4 weeks of testing. In our laboratory that\nrestoration of function by a drug treatment in a chronic deficit model (following electrolytic cortical\nlesions) is established within this time frame, but admittedly the declaration of a 4-week test period is\narbitrary and may not generalize to other models of brain injury.\nCombining the results on several tests in the form of a neuroscore has both advantages and\ndisadvantages. On the one hand, the single score may give an estimate of overall neurological function\nin animals receiving neurotrauma or ischemia. Presentation of this type of data allows for a quick\nassessment of the sensorimotor capacity of brain or spinal cord damaged animals and easy comparison\nbetween drug and untreated groups. Moreover, it takes into account performance on a range of\nbehaviors rather than focusing on the results of a single test. However, one advantage of using multiple\nbehavioral tests is to determine the limits of any drug effect on recovery of function. That is, there is\nevidence to suggest that glutamate antagonists may accelerate recovery on some behavioral tasks but\nnot others. By exclusively using combined neurological scores, the possible behavioral limitations of\nglutamate antagonists will remain largely undetermined. Moreover, by combining the results on several\ntasks there is a risk that the magnitude of any drug effect will be misleading. For example, if there is a\nsmall effect of the drug on several tasks, combining the results across tests will inflate the effectiveness\nof the agent. On the other hand, if there is a large drug effect on one or two tests and only a slight or 83\nnonsignificant effect on others, the combined score may reveal a nonsignificant treatment effect or only\nmarginally significant results. In this case, although overall neurological function is only slightly impaired,\nthe specific behavioral effect of the drug treatment may be lost.\nAnother issue concerning the behavioral evaluation of brain-damaged subjects is the need for\nquantification of the deficits. Researchers often use subjective rating scales to assess sensorimotor\nbehaviors. These rating scales appear to have a high degree of interrater reliability and for this reason\nare acceptable measures of behavior. However, the use of these scales without any additional\nquantification of the impairment limits the types of statistical analyses that may be performed. In most\ncases, the behavioral measure is an ordinal scale and therefore requires a nonparametric statistic. There\nis no adequate nonparametric statistic that will allow for statements to be made about differences in\nthe rate of recovery between groups. In contrast, an analysis of variance, where repeated testing over\ntime may be measured as a within groups variable, allows for a treatment x test day (or hour)\ninteraction and a comparison of the rates of recovery between groups. Differences in the rate of\nrecovery between groups becomes an important issue if two groups of animals (e.g., treated and\nnontreated) fail to show a reliable difference on the first few test days but show significant differences\nthereafter. Such results have been shown in rats with lesions of the rat cortex and treatment with MK-\n801 beginning 16 hours after the brain injury (Barth, Grant, & Schallert, 1990; Barbay & Barth, 1993).\nA Behavioral Research Program Using MK-801: Timing is Everything\nWe have studied the effects of MK-801 on the recovery and maintenance of function after lesions\nincluding the forelimb representation in the primary somatosensory and motor cortex (SMC) of the rat.\nMK-801 is known to reduce the amount of brain damage and edema as well as improve behavioral\nrecovery in at least some cases following experimentally induced stroke, trauma, or cortical lesions.\nThe first step we chose to take in investigating the potential behavioral effects of MK-801 was to\ndetermine if it facilitated recovery on several sensorimotor tasks that evaluate functions of the forelimb.\nThe SMC lesion produces a syndrome that includes impairments in tactile placing reflexes, placement of\nthe forelimbs during locomotion, and removal of adhesive patches placed on the forelimbs. We create\nthe lesion in one cerebral hemisphere (i.e., a unilateral lesion) so all sensorimotor deficits are seen only\nwith the limb opposite to the side of the lesion (often called contralateral deficits). If we place the lesion\nin the left hemisphere, then we will observe sensorimotor deficits on the right forelimb. Depending on\nthe extent of the lesion, these impairments typically recover in 1-4 weeks if postoperative tests begin 1\nor 2 days following the injury, and are administered on a schedule of approximately 2-4 tests per week.\nInitial studies suggested that if the first administration of MK-801 is given 16 hours after the lesion, then\ndrug effects would be seen only on the adhesive patch test (Barth et al., 1990). However, in this study\nrecovery on the placing tests occurred in 10 days. Most recovery of function studies with glutamate\nantagonists begin injections 15 min - 1 hr after the injury. This relatively fast rate of recovery, along with\nthe initial injection occurring at 16 hours after surgery, left open the possibility that MK-801 might have\nan effect on a wider range of deficits if the duration of the behavioral deficit could be extended in\nuntreated rats with SMC lesions. When the duration of the deficit was extended to 24-35 days (in\nuntreated rats) by increasing the size of the SMC lesion, MK-801 given at 16 hours facilitated recovery of\nforelimb tactile placing but still had no effect on locomotor placing (Barbay et al., 1992). This limitation\non the effects of MK-801 could be removed if treatment began sooner after the lesion; hence, Hoane et\nal. (1997) reported that MK-801 significantly facilitated recovery on all of the sensorimotor tests if it was\nadministered 15 min after the larger cortical lesion. It is important to realize that the recovery pattern\n(defined as the time taken to reach preoperative baseline performance) for saline treated rats was 84\naround 24 days. Thus, increasing the size of the lesion extended the time to recovery and a facilitative\neffect for MK-801 is now shown for all sensorimotor tests examined if treatment begins soon after the\nbrain damage. These data suggest that there are no apparent limitations of MK-801 on recovery from\nsensorimotor deficits if the drug is administered soon (i.e., 15 min) after the brain injury. Moreover,\nthese data may indicate different windows of opportunity for the various sensorimotor tests.\nPrevious studies have suggested that there is a window of opportunity following brain damage within\nwhich neuroprotective drugs may have their beneficial effects. Treatment with the neuroprotective\nagent outside this window will have either no effect or may even be detrimental to recovery and\nmaintenance of sensorimotor functions. In our next study (Saponjic, 1994), we began to define this\nwindow of opportunity for MK-801. We gave a single injection of MK-801 at 15 min, 2 hours and 48\nhours after the unilateral SMC lesion and tested the rats on the same battery of tests mentioned earlier.\nWhen a single injection is given at 15 min, rats treated with MK-801 showed a significant sparing of\nfunction on the first postoperative test day when compared to a group of saline-treated controls rats\n(performance on postoperative day 1 is better in the MK-801 treated rats). If MK-801 treatment is\ndelayed until 2 hours after surgery, the sparing is no longer observed, however, there is a clear\nfacilitation of recovery over time when compared to the saline-treated lesion control rats. This\ndifference in the rate of recovery is supported by a significant treatment x days interaction. In this case,\nthe repeated testing over numerous postoperative test days was an extremely important factor\nnecessary to see the effect of MK-801. Finally, if MK-801 administration is delayed for 48 hours, the\neffect of the drug on sparing and recovery of function is lost. If we combine these data with those of\nprevious work that showed a drug effect at 16 hours after the lesion, we may conclude that at least for\nsome behaviors the \"treatment window\" for MK-801 extends up to 16 hours with there being no effect\nat 48 hours These data suggest a much longer window than those reported by others that suggest MK-\n801 may be effective only up to about 1 hr after the lesion (Shapira et al., 1990). This difference may be\ndue to the type of behavioral tests, quantification of the behavioral deficit, or the duration of\npostoperative testing.\nUp to this point we have discussed the effects of MK-801 on the restoration of functions that would\notherwise still recover even if no treatment was given (albeit at a slower rate). Although acceleration of\nrecovery by MK-801 is a significant finding, it is questionable whether such an effect would generalize to\ncases where there is little or no expected recovery. We have found that if the electrolytic lesion was\nenlarged, forelimb placing deficits appear to be permanent. Rats with these large lesions showed no\nsigns of recovery of forelimb placing during a 6-month postoperative testing period. This more severe\ndeficit may reflect a more complete destruction of corticospinal neurons that innervate the forelimb\nspinal cord. We tested the effects of MK-801 given 16 hours after the lesion and found no significant\nimprovement in recovery of forelimb placing. However, in a more recent study (Hoane et al., 1995) we\nfound that MK-801 \"induces\" a significant, yet still incomplete, restoration of forelimb placing if\nadministered 15 min after the large SMC lesion. These data are important because they suggest that at\nleast partial recovery is possible after this larger lesion, and that the window of opportunity may be\ndifferent depending on the extent of the brain injury. An important question for future studies will be to\ndetermine the area or areas that are mediating the forelimb placing in these animals with large SMC\nlesions.\nAlthough MK-801 appears to have a beneficial effect on recovery after brain damage, it also produces\nadverse anatomical and behavioral effects. For example, MK-801 produces transient structural changes\nin cortical neurons of intact rats including the expression of heat shock protein 70 which is a\ncharacteristic of injured neurons (Auer & Coulter, 1994; Olney, Labruyere, & Price, 1989; Sharp, 85\nKinouchi, & Koistinaho, 1993). Moreover, behavioral studies have shown that MK-801 may disrupt\nlearning and memory (Whishaw & Auer, 1989; Morris et al., 1989) and cortical plasticity during\ndevelopment (Rauschecker & Hahn, 1987).\nMK-801 also appears to interfere with the maintenance of recovered functions. Barth et al. (1990)\nshowed that a single injection of MK-801, given after behavioral recovery from very small unilateral SMC\nlesions, reinstated the function in the contralateral forelimb (i.e., the forelimb on the side of the body\nopposite to the hemisphere containing the brain damage). This recovery placed deficits for up to 7 days\nafter the injection (i.e., reinstatement effect). MK-801 did not affect placing with the forelimb ipsilateral\nto the lesion (i.e., the forelimb on the same side of the body as the hemisphere containing the brain\ndamage), nor did it affect placing reactions in intact control rats. In a more recent study, the SMC lesions\nwere slightly extended in order to produce a longer time to recovery. In this study, the saline-treated\nrats recovered from the placing deficits in about 35 days. They were then given a single postrecovery\ninjection of MK-801. As expected, MK-801 reinstated the forelimb placing deficits. However, in this case\nthe reinstated deficits lasted for approximately 30-35 days. Thus, postrecovery injections of MK-801\nappear to trigger behavioral deficits for a time period similar to that observed after the cortical lesion.\nThese data suggest that although there is recovery following the cortical lesion, the maintenance of this\nrecovery is fragile and potentially vulnerable to later drug treatments. This issue of the maintenance of\nfunction is especially important given the duration of the reinstated deficits.\nA next question might be whether or not there is a way to stabilize the recovered functions such that\nthey are not vulnerable to postrecovery injections of MK-801. We hypothesized that the reinstatement\neffect might occur because the neural circuits that maintain the restored functions are insufficient to\nwithstand the drug challenge. The neural circuits likely would include subcortical as well as cortical areas\nremote from the cortical damage. If this were the case, then treatment with MK-801 beginning soon\nafter the cortical lesion might block the reinstatement effect by keeping the appropriate remote circuits\nintact. Previous experiments have shown that both the striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata are\naffected by the cortical lesion and that these anatomical effects could be prevented or at least reduced\nby MK-801 given up to 16 hours after the brain injury. For example, following a SMC lesion there is a\nconcomitant atrophy of the posterior striatum and a loss of neurons in the substantia nigra. Both of\nthese remote events are blocked by early treatment with MK-801 (Barth et al., 1990). It may be the case\nthat the presence of this subcortical deterioration is a contributing factor in the inability of the rats to\nmaintain the recovered behavior; likewise, the preservation of these sites may block the reinstatement\neffect.\nIn another study, rats received unilateral SMC lesions and either saline or MK-801, 16 hours after\nsurgery. The animals were tested on forelimb placing tests until they returned to preoperative baseline\nlevels of performance on two consecutive test days. After recovery appeared to be complete, the rats\nwere then given an injection of either MK-801 or saline. Thus, the experiment consisted of four groups\n(early treatment/late treatment): saline/saline; saline/MK-801; MK-801/saline; MK-801/MK-801. We\nexpected that the saline/MK-801 group would show the reinstatement effect and the saline/saline and\nMK-801/saline groups would fail to show any reappearance of the forelimb placing symptoms. The\nimportant question was whether the MK-801/MK-801 group would show the reinstatement effect.\nThese rats show a sparing of neurons in subcortical areas due to the neuroprotective effects of an early\ninjection of MK-801, and therefore might be resistant to the reinstatement effect. The MK-801/MK-801\ngroup failed to show a reinstatement of forelimb placing deficits following the postrecovery injection of\nMK-801. Subsequent studies have shown that the lack of reinstatement effect in these animals is\nprobably not due to repeated exposure to MK-801 (Barbay et al., 1992). These data support the view 86\nthat the cortical lesion and concomitant subcortical degeneration leaves the animals vulnerable to a\nreappearance of forelimb placing deficits after recovery. However, the preservation of subcortical\nneurons with early treatment of the neuroprotective agent MK-801 appears to be important for the\nmaintenance of recovered functions. Thus, early treatment with MK-801 not only facilitates recovery of\nsensorimotor function, it also allows for a stable maintenance of those recovered functions.\nBehavioral studies have shown the potential for glutamate antagonists to facilitate recovery of function\nafter cortical or spinal cord damage. These behavioral studies also suggest that the duration of\nglutamate antagonist treatment is an important factor to consider when designing human clinical trials,\nbecause late administration of MK-801 may be harmful to recovery of function. Many questions that are\nbest addressed through behavioral studies remain largely unanswered. Most importantly, the effects of\nglutamate antagonists on permanent deficits and whether those recovered functions can be maintained\nare questions that should be addressed. Ultimately it will be important to identify those neural circuits\nthat allow for recovery and maintenance of function. In the case of cortical injury, we have alluded to\nthe possibility that these answers may be found in the pattern of secondary degeneration in subcortical\nstructures associated with the primary injury. Preventing or limiting the amount of subcortical\ndegeneration may lead to a restoration of function and a stable maintenance of those recovered\nfunctions. If these subcortical systems are critical for recovery, we must ask whether their integrity\nallows for the restoration of the function lost or whether they represent a parallel system that\nencourages the development of alternative behavioral strategies. Only through extensive behavioral\nanalyses can these questions be answered.\nRecovery of Function Studies in the 21st Century\nCan we attain the goal of developing a pharmacological treatment for stroke and closed-head injury?\nAlthough the end of the 20th century gave us a deeper understanding of the events that occur around\nthe time of the brain damage, we still do not have an obvious candidate that can be safely and\neffectively used as a treatment. I expect that it is going to become clear that an important part of that\nsearch will be to find an agent that can be given at time periods long after the injury occurred. It seems\nunrealistic that treatments whose effectiveness is limited to the time period soon after the brain injury\n(i.e., 15 minutes) will be of much value in the long run. Ideally, a treatment should be safe regardless of\nwhen it is given and even be effective at promoting restoration of functions long after the injury\noccurred. The focus of research in the 21st century should be on affecting chronic deficits. This approach\nmight involve rehabilitative strategies, both pharmacological and behavioral, that encourage the\ndevelopment of alternate behavioral strategies that allow for compensation of the lost function. This\napproach might have as a neural basis those models of plasticity discussed at the beginning of this\nchapter.\nMagnesium: A Possible Safe and Effective Treatment for Brain Injury\nOne of the events that follows an injury to the brain is a depletion of magnesium in the brain and spinal\ncord. We are just beginning to understand the importance of this occurrence. Magnesium is a critical\nelement for neural transmission and basic cellular processes in the brain. It is essential for protein and\nRNA synthesis and the stabilization of cell membranes. Magnesium serves as a modulator of activity at\nsome glutamate receptors. Magnesium blocks the activity of glutamate by directly binding to a receptor\nsite within the calcium channel. When glutamate binds to it's receptor, calcium will enter the neuron\nand cause a depolarization. However, magnesium blocks the entry of calcium and therefore inhibits the\nactivity of glutamate. Thus, magnesium serves as a glutamate antagonist and a neuroprotective agent. 87\nTreatment with magnesium has been used in experimental models of stroke and head trauma. These\nstudies have shown that treatment with magnesium reduce the amount of brain damage and accelerate\nthe rate of behavioral recovery (Hoane, Raad & Barth, 1997; Izumi, Rousel, Pinard, & Selyaz, 1991;\nMcIntosh, 1993; Vacanti & Ames, 1984 ). Because magnesium is relatively safe, it becomes an attractive\noption for treatment following brain injury. Moreover, magnesium has unique qualities that may make it\nuseful beyond the time immediately following brain injury. Specifically, magnesium may be useful as a\npreventative treatment and long after the injury in cases where there are chronic deficits. In the latter\ncase, magnesium may be effective in promoting neural and behavioral plasticity by indirectly affecting\ncertain neurotransmitter systems.\nResearchers have used magnesium treatment as a preventative treatment for several medical\nconditions, such as coronary heart disease and postoperative pain management (Bashir et al., 1993;\nLassere, Spoerri, Moullet, & Theubet, 1994; Sjostrom & Weiner, 1996). Treatment in these cases\nsuggests that magnesium supplements can elevate and maintain plasma levels for a prolonged period of\ntime. Although there is little evidence pertaining to the long-term elevation of magnesium levels\nthrough the use of supplements, our data suggests that daily treatment with magnesium may lead to\nbeneficial effects in the case of experimentally induced brain injury. We administered magnesium\nchloride to rats for 2 or 5 days with the last treatment ending 24 hours prior to a unilateral lesion in the\nSMC (Hoane, Irish, Marks, & Barth, 1998). When compared to saline-treated control rats, magnesium-\ntreated animals showed less severe behavioral impairments, accelerated rates of recovery, and a\nreduction in the amount of atrophy in structures connected to but remote from the SMC. We believe\nthat these data have far reaching implications for the preventative treatment of brain injury in high risk\npopulations. For example, these data may be particularly important for individuals with a history of\nstroke or those participating in high contact sports like football or boxing. Could it be that daily\nmagnesium supplements will \"inoculate\" these individuals against some of the secondary effects of\nbrain injury?\nA second potentially novel use of magnesium may be in the treatment of chronic deficits that occur\nfollowing brain injury. As stated previously, although it is important to develop treatments that prevent\nthe extent of brain injury through administration of agents around the time of the damage, it is equally\nimportant to develop treatments that can be used long after the initial trauma or stroke. The population\nof individuals with chronic neurological deficits due to trauma or stroke is getting larger and there is\ncurrently no effective treatment for these individuals. Is it possible that there is some type of\nintervention that can be used to help restore function long after the injury? In a pilot study, we\nproduced chronic sensorimotor deficits in rats by making very large unilateral SMC lesions. As stated\npreviously, this large SMC lesion produces impairments that do not recover for at least 6 months. In six\nrats with these large lesions we administered a daily regimen of magnesium chloride beginning 2 weeks\nafter the lesion was created (Mishalanie, Stuntz, & Barth, 1997). Daily injections were given over a 2-\nweek period. By the end of the injection period the treated rats were showing a partial restoration of\nforelimb placing behavior. However, after treatment was discontinued, the performance of the\nmagnesium treated rats slowly worsened until they were as impaired as rats given no treatment. Several\nweeks later, we resumed magnesium chloride treatment and the rats once again showed a partial\nrestoration of function that could only be maintained for a short time after the treatment was\ndiscontinued. These data suggest that the severity of chronic sensorimotor deficits associated with brain\ndamage can be reduced, at least temporarily.\nThere are several possibilities for the mechanism of magnesium's effect on chronic deficits. A first\npossibility is that following brain damage there may be a population of neurons remote from the site of 88\ndamage that becomes inactive. In the early 1900s, von Monakow introduced this idea in his theory of\ndiaschisis. According to von Monakow, behavioral impairments following brain injury are due to the\nactual tissue lost, and to the metabolic depression of areas proximal and remote to the brain injury. Von\nMonakow called this metabolic depression, \"neural shock\" or diaschisis. Does magnesium somehow\nbring these neurons back from diaschisis? If so, what has made these neurons inactive and how does\nmagnesium have its beneficial effect? If we take this idea to its logical conclusion, we may suggest that\nin people with chronic behavioral deficits due to brain injury, there are silent neurons that have the\npotential to become active again. This is an exciting possibility, because it suggests that the basic\n\"hardware\" is available, we just have to find a way to activate it.\nMagnesium has the potential to affect the nervous system in a variety of ways. However, an\nunderstanding of the neurobiology of magnesium would not reveal its true potential as an effective\ntreatment for brain injury. This potential is realized as we combine the neuroanatomical,\nneurophysiological, and neuropharmacological data with neurobehavioral studies of magnesium\ntreatment.\nNeuroplasticity and Recovery of Function\nHow do the neuroplastic events mentioned at the beginning of this chapter help us to understand\nrecovery of function after brain damage? If we assume that these models are the basis for learning and\nmemory, we find ourselves at the doorstep of an important concept in the study of recovery of function.\nThis concept is behavioral compensation. Behavioral compensation is the idea that following brain\ndamage the improvement in performance that we often label as a restoration of function is actually the\ndevelopment of an alternate behavioral strategy. Thus, the behavioral process following brain-damage is\nbetter characterized as the learning of a compensatory behavior rather than a restoration of a function.\nIf recovery after brain injury is due to learning a new motor skill or cognitive strategy to compensate for\nthe lost function, then models like LTP become relevant. For example, if a unilateral brain lesion in the\nmotor cortex of the rat produces contralateral sensorimotor deficits, then \"recovery\" may include the\ndevelopment of new motor skills and LTP-like phenomenon in other cortical areas. A solid research\nprogram would need to include both very sophisticated behavioral analyses to describe the alternate or\ncompensatory behavior and physiological measurement to show the development of LTP. If a strong\ncorrelation in the time course of these behavioral and physiological phenomena can be demonstrated,\nthen we may conclude that effective treatments would include those procedures that encourage the\nlearning of new behaviors and the development of LTP. Moreover, researchers could support and\nstrengthen the hypothesis that LTP is a mechanism of behavioral compensation if it can be shown that\npharmacological manipulations affecting the time course of one, also affects the timing of the other.\nExperiments aimed at challenging the correlations between the behavioral and neurophysiological\nevents would be most important for both understanding the process of recovery after brain damage and\nthe development of effective treatments.\nThe second model of neural plasticity we have considered includes the experience-induced increase in\ndendritic branching and the possibility that behavior can drive morphological and neurophysiological\nchanges in the brain. Jones and Schallert (1992; 1994) investigated this issue in regard to recovery of\nfunction after brain injury. They showed that rats with unilateral lesions in the SMC exhibited\nsensorimotor deficits contralateral to the brain injury. They also showed a hyperreliance of the forelimb\nipsilateral to brain damage. If the SMC in the left hemisphere is damaged, then there are sensorimotor\ndeficits with the right forelimb and a hyperreliance on the left forelimb). This hyperreliance appeared to 89\nbe correlated with an increase in dendritic branching in the SMC of the intact cortex (which controls the\nunimpaired limb). This increase in dendritic branching was maximal 2-3 weeks after the injury, and was\nactually \"pruned back\" at later time points. The time course of dendritic changes appeared to correlate\nwith the relative use of the corresponding unimpaired forelimb. The authors concluded that the overuse\nof the unimpaired limbs might be driving the reported structural changes. This hypothesis was\nchallenged in the next series of experiments. Jones and Schallert decided to restrict the use of the\nunimpaired limb by placing a one-sleeved cast on rats immediately after the SMC lesion. In this case, it\nwas impossible for the rats to use the unimpaired limb, so if the before-mentioned dendritic changes\nfailed to occur it could be concluded that, in fact, the hyper-reliance on the unimpaired limb was a\nnecessary factor to induce the neuroplasticity. Moreover, if casted nonlesioned animals showed the\nsame dendritic changes, then the neuroplastic event could be specifically related to the behavioral\nexperience. The results were that casted lesioned rats failed to show the increase in dendritic branching,\nbut casted nonlesioned rats also failed to exhibit the effect. These results lead the authors to conclude\nthat the behavioral experience produced the dendritic changes only if there was a cortical lesion\npresent. These data suggested that following a brain lesion, intact areas of the brain may have a greater\npotential for neuroplastic changes. One question for future research will be to determine the factors or\nevents that follow brain injury and allow for greater neuroplasticity. Is some substance that encourages\nneuroplasticity released following a trauma? Could changes in electrical gradients be responsible for the\nenhanced neuroplasticity? There are many candidates (i.e., neurotrophic factors) that once isolated,\ncould be used to induce neuroplasticity. The discovery of the neuroplastic triggers or enhancers may be\na very important event in the treatment of people with chronic brain damage, if we consider they are\nprobably only available for a relatively short time after the trauma. Jones and Schallert report that the\nincrease in dendritic branching is maximal at 2-3 weeks and thereafter there is a pruning back of\ndendrites. The pruning back may be due to behavioral recovery, but also could be due to the lack of\nthese neuroplastic triggers. Moreover, it may be the case that the neuroplastic enhancer will also have a\nbeneficial effect on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.\nThe final model we discussed was cortical reorganization. The malleability of cortical fields is\nundoubtedly dependent on behavior. In an attempt to integrate this model to the question of recovery\nafter brain damage, we should ask the question, \"What are the behavioral parameters that best produce\nthe neuroplastic change? For example, do our current physical rehabilitation plans optimize the\npotential for change in cortical field physiology? Does the frequency and vigor of treatment lead to the\nbest behavioral recovery, and is this correlated with changes in the cortex? Researchers can best answer\nthese questions with animal models of brain damage and plasticity.\nSome Advice for Researchers in the 21st Century\nTo answer the questions put forth in the preceding sections, neuroscience researchers must continue to\nreceive interdisciplinary training represented as the four legs of neuroscience. However, unlike the past,\nthe future will place much more emphasis on behavioral analysis. This shift in emphasis will mean that\ntraining in experimental design and statistics will become more important. The renewed interest in\nphysiological psychology integrated with }cutting edge\" technology may very well turn the steady pace\nof progress into a gallop.\nConclusions\nThe 21st century will be an exciting time for neuroscience and physiological psychology; there will be\nextensive examination of the dynamic brain and its relationship to changes in behavior. Researchers 90\nmust continually challenge the correlations between the changes in brain structure, chemistry,\nphysiology, and behavior because there will likely be numerous dynamic events to consider. An\nimportant topic for investigation will be how behavior drives neuroplastic events. Once this idea\nbecomes more accepted in the neuroscience community, the true marriage between neuroscience and\nbehavioral science will be realized. This realization will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of\nbrain function. The application of this new understanding will be new and more effective behavioral and\npharmacological treatments for brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease. Thus, scientists will\ntake another major step in achieving the goals set in the Decade of the Brain.\nReferences\nAldridge, J.W., & Berridge, K.C. (1998).

Instead, it will be integrated into mainstream psychology. Yet that integration\nshould not be a total assimilation of cross-cultural psychology into mainstream psychology. There will be\nmajor accommodations as well, fundamentally changing the essence of the way we model and study\nhuman behavior. We are already witness to these changes, as we are in the middle of an evolution in\npsychology.\nIn this chapter, I would like to describe why I believe we are in the midst of this evolution. I will first\ndescribe compelling issues that have driven cross-cultural psychology until now. Then I will illustrate\nadvances in knowledge about human behavior by describing current knowledge in my field of expertise,\nemotional expression and perception. I speculate about the future of research in this area, and describe\nchallenges facing cross-cultural psychology as a whole for the next two decades. I end this chapter by\noffering some friendly advice to those who want to get into this exciting and wonderful area of\npsychology.\nCompelling Research Issues in Cross-cultural Psychology\nIn the past, cross-cultural psychology was perceived as an \"exotic\" branch of psychology for those with\nesoteric interests in culture. Cross-cultural studies were generally viewed as an interesting aberrant of\nmore serious research in mainstream psychology and were generally not assimilated into mainstream\nknowledge. Today, however, cross-cultural psychology is viewed as a serious endeavor. Studies\nreporting cultural differences are widespread and common and make fundamental challenges to\nmainstream knowledge. Throughout this history, a common thread ties much of this literature together,\nand that is its overwhelming concern with uncovering universal and culturally specific aspects of\nbehavior.\nIndeed, cross-cultural research has uncovered many psychological processes that appear to be universal.\nThese include, for example, the perception and language of color; processes of language acquisition;\nprinciples of cognition, thinking, and learning; gender differences in mate selection and gender\nstereotypes; and recognition and expression of facial expressions of emotions. Not only do these\nfindings provide important bases by which we can find commonality with fellow humans, they also allow\nus to speculate about their biological substrates, innateness, and evolutionary and adaptive significance.\nBut cross-cultural research has also produced important cultural differences. These occur in\ntemperament, attachment, and child-rearing; cognitive, moral, and socioemotional development; the\nstructure and function of language; rules for displaying and perceiving emotions; psychopathology and\nphysical health; and much more. Collectively, they tell us that culture plays an important role in shaping\nhuman experience and worldview as well.\nUncovering cultural similarities and differences in psychological traits and behaviors is extremely\nimportant to the field for several reasons. First, it helps us refine and revise our theoretical 99\nunderstanding of human behavior. This activity is important if we want to have theories in psychology\nthat are applicable to the widest audience possible. For example, cross-cultural research has helped to\nrefine our understanding of child-rearing practices and attachment, modifying what the field considered\nto be optimal attachment and child-rearing based on research conducted solely in the U.S. to\naccommodate important differences in these practices around the world. Second, uncovering cross-\ncultural differences helps us deliver more effective psychologically-based services to the public. These\nactivities occur through psychotherapy, counseling, business consulting, and the like, most of which are\ndependent on accurate information and knowledge about people derived from research. Cross-cultural\nresearch, for instance, has been instrumental in helping to develop culturally sensitive methods of\npsychological assessment and treatment, which is an important factor in psychotherapeutic\neffectiveness. Third, cross-cultural research is important because it provides important links and\nconnections among people and psychologists all around the world, helping to forge new ways of\ninternational and intercultural cooperation among scholars and practitioners alike. New organizations\nthat cross many borders involve psychologists and health-professionals, creating unions that would not\nbe possible otherwise.\nMost current works in cross-cultural psychology document cultural difference through cross-cultural\ncomparison. While these studies are found primarily in journals devoted to culture, such as the Journal\nof Cross-cultural Psychology, today they are found in many mainstream journals as well. Moreover, if\nculture is defined as a sociopsychological construct, as most writers do, then not only are people of\ndifferent races, ethnicities, and nationalities members of different cultures; so are people of different\ngenders, sexual orientations, and abilities. If you take this entire literature encompassing all these\ngroups of people together as a whole, you will notice that cross-cultural research is widespread and\ncommonplace in all areas of psycholog, and makes important contributions to knowledge. Cross-cultural\ncomparison has become a staple in the academic diets of contemporary psychologists, and the existence\nof cultural differences and the importance of culture to mold our lives is now well accepted. This\nawareness is due, in part, to the overwhelming amount of cross-cultural research that has been\nconducted to date and the documentation of similarities and differences, which has been the compelling\nissue in cross-cultural psychology for years.\nCultural Influences on Emotional Expression and Perception\nCross-cultural research in my own field of study - emotional expression and perception - exemplifies\nmany of the developments and advances in cross-cultural psychology over the past twenty or thirty\nyears, and I would like to review these developments here. I was first interested in this field as an\nundergraduate at the University of Michigan. For example, I wondered how infants, who did not speak\nor understand totally language that was spoken around them, could understand the emotional states of\ntheir mothers, fathers, and other caretakers around them. Under the supervision of Robert Zajonc, I\ndesigned a little study that tested the ability of young children to judge accurately emotions portrayed in\nnonverbal vocal cues. An opportunity followed that allowed me to conduct this study cross-culturally.\nOnce into graduate school, I continued to delve into this area, immersing myself in the study of facial\nexpressions under the tutelage of Paul Ekman at the University of California, San Francisco. Before I\nknew it, this area consumed my research endeavors during graduate school and helped to launch my\ncareer in this area.\nAs in other areas, comparisons demonstrating both cultural similarity and difference have been\nextremely important in the area of emotional expression and perception. Knowing about similarities and\ndifferences in emotion across cultures helps us understand the possible innate, biological substrates of 100\nemotion that are universal across all peoples regardless of culture. It helps us to understand the role of\nemotion in our lives and the importance of emotion to thinking and behaving. Such comparisons help us\nto understand the role of emotion and nonverbal behaviors in social interactions with the goal of\nimproving interactions among people from different cultural backgrounds. And, this research helps us to\nconsider the common bases upon which humans develop, providing a backdrop for mutual\nunderstanding and cooperation across cultures.\nThe last thirty years were witness to the \"universality studies,\" which documented convincingly the\nuniversality of a set of six facial expressions of emotion, including anger, disgust, fear, happiness,\nsadness, and surprise. The emotions appear to be biologically innate, appearing in non-human primates\nand congenitally blind individuals (Charlesworth & Kreutzer, 1973; Ekman, 1973) and correspond to\nsimilarities in emotion taxonomies in different languages in the world (Romney, Boyd, Moore,\nBatchelder, & Brazill, 1996; Romney, Moore, & Rusch, 1997). We also know, however, that people\nmodify their expressions on the basis of cultural display rules (Ekman, 1972; Ekman & Friesen, 1969;\nFriesen, 1972). These are culturally prescribed rules, learned early in life, that dictate the management\nand modification of the universal expressions depending on social circumstance. After the original\nuniversality studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many studies have replicated the universal\nrecognition of these expressions (see reviews in Ekman, 1982). Today their universality, as well as the\nexistence of display rules, are well accepted in mainstream psychology (see also Fridlund's (1997) view\nof display rules, which is different than that originally postulated by Ekman and Friesen).\nRecent research has extended the universality findings in important ways. Some studies have shown\nmore ways in which cultures are similar, implicating consequences of expression universality. Other\nstudies have produced differences, extending our knowledge about how cultures influence expression\nand perception. Collectively, they give us further insights to the biological and environmental processes\nthat underlie facial expressions and emotion.\nMore Cultural Similarities in Emotional Expression\nIn contempt. In the last decade, a number of studies have reported the existence of a seventh universal\nfacial expression of emotion: contempt. Initial evidence was collected from ten cultures including West\nSumatra (Ekman & Friesen, 1986; Ekman & Heider, 1988). This finding was later replicated by\nMatsumoto (1992b) in four cultures, three of which were different from Ekman and Friesen's original\nten. This finding received considerable attention and criticism (Russell, 1991a, b; Izard & Haynes, 1988).\nRussell (1991a, b), for example, suggested that the context in which the expression was shown\ninfluenced results in favor of universality. In his study, the contempt expression was more often labeled\nas either disgust or sadness when shown either alone or after showing a disgust or sad picture (Russell,\n1991). Ekman, O'Sullivan, and Matsumoto (1991a, b), however, reanalyzed their data to address this\ncriticism and found no effect of context. Biehl et al. (1997) also found no effects for other possible\nmethodological confounds.\nIn relative intensity. When comparing expressions, do people of different cultures agree on which is\nmore strongly expressed? Cross-cultural research indicates that the answer to this question is yes.\nEkman et al. (1987) compared these differences in paired expressions of the same emotion. Ninety-two\npercent of the time, the ten cultures in their study agreed on which of two expressions was more\nintense. Matsumoto and Ekman (1989) extended this finding by including comparisons across different\nposer types, including Caucasian and Japanese posers. Looking separately for each emotion, within\nculture and across gender and then within gender across culture, Americans and Japanese agreed on\nwhich photo was more intense in 24 out of 30 comparisons. These findings suggest that cultures judge 101\nemotions on a similar basis, despite differences in facial physiognomy, morphology, race, and sex of the\nposers, and culturally prescribed rules governing the expression and perception of faces. These findings\nare important because they suggest that people of different cultures use the same visual cues in judging\nothers.\nIn the association between perceived expression intensity and interpretation. Do people of different\ncultures agree on their assumptions about the relationship between expression and experience when\njudging others? Matsumoto, Kasri, and Kooken (1999) showed Japanese and American observers 56\nexpressions posed by Japanese and Caucasians. The observers judged what emotion the poser was\nexpressing, and then the strength of both the external display and internal experience. Correlations\nbetween the two intensity ratings were conducted twice, first across observers separately for each\nexpression, and second across expressions for each observer. Regardless of the computation, the\ncorrelations were high and positive for both cultures and for all expressions. Observers associated the\nstrength of the external display with the presumed strength of the experience of that display, suggesting\ncommonality in that linkage across culture. The link between the presence or absence of an expression\nwith the underlying experience, and the intensity of both, is a topic of considerable importance in\ncontemporary theories of emotion. Some authors have claimed that the linkage between expression\nand experience is unfounded (e.g., Russell, 1997; Fernandez-Dols, 1997). Others, however, have argued\nthat expressions and experience are intimately linked with each other (but need not always be coupled)\n(Rosenberg & Ekman, 1994; see also the literature on the facial feedback hypothesis, reviewed by\nMatsumoto, 1987; Winton, 1986). The data from Matsumoto et al. (1997) clearly support notions of\nlinkage.\nIn secondary emotional recognition. Do people of different cultures agree on the secondary emotions\nportrayed in an expression? Research findings suggest the answer to this question is yes. Observers in\nEkman et al.'s (1987) study judged not only which emotion was portrayed in the faces, but also the\nintensity of each of seven emotion categories. This task, therefore, allowed observers to report multiple\nemotions, or no emotion, instead of being forced to select an emotion to describe the face. While\nprevious studies showed universality in the first mode of response, cultures may have differed in which\nemotion is next most prevalent. Analyses, however, supported cultural agreement. For every culture in\nEkman et al.'s (1987) study, the secondary emotion for the disgust expressions was contempt, and for\nfear expressions surprise. For anger, the second mode varied depending on the photo, with disgust,\nsurprise and contempt as the second responses. These findings were replicated by Matsumoto and\nEkman (1989) and Biehl et al. (1997), suggesting pancultural agreement in the multiple meanings\nderived from universal faces. This agreement may exist because of overlap in the semantics of the\nemotion categories, antecedents and elicitors of emotion, or in the facial configurations themselves.\nIn perceived expressivity. Do people of different cultures have similar stereotypes about the expressivity\nof other cultures? In one study (Pittam et al., 1995), Australian and Japanese subjects completed a\nquestionnaire regarding overall level of expressivity of Australians and Japanese. Both Australian and\nJapanese subjects rated the Japanese as less expressive than the Australians. These findings indicated\nthat people of different cultures believe that there are differences in intensity of emotion expression,\nand that they agree about who is more or less expressive.\nMore Cultural Differences\nIn emotion recognition. Are there ways in which cultures differ in their judgments of emotion? Actually,\nalthough the original universality research showed that subjects recognized emotions at well over 102\nchance rates, no study ever reported perfect cross-cultural agreement. Matsumoto (1992a), for\nexample, compared Japanese and American judgments, and found that recognition rates ranged from\n64% to 99%, which were consistent with earlier universality studies. Americans were better at\nrecognizing anger, disgust, fear, and sadness than the Japanese, but accuracy rates did not differ for\nhappiness or surprise.\nCultural differences in recognition rates do not necessarily suggest non-universality, as has been\nsuggested (Russell, 1994; see also critiques of Russell's thesis by Ekman, 1994, and Izard, 1994), and\nseveral studies have attempted to uncover possible explanations for these differences. Matsumoto\n(1992a) suggested that the differences in recognition rates are due to cultural differences in socially\nlearned rules about how emotions could be recognized. Specifically, cultural differences between Japan\nand the US in the allowance for individuality or conformity may have contributed to their findings. In\nJapan, because of the emphasis on group harmony and conformity, emotions that threaten these would\nbe discouraged. Therefore, a Japanese person would be careful to not show negative emotions, and\nhave a tendency to not recognize these expressions in others. In contrast, the United States, a country\nthat encourages individuality, would encourage both the expression and perception of negative\nemotions.\nElsewhere (Matsumoto, 1996), I have suggested a mechanism similar to Ekman and Friesen's\nneurocultural theory of expression to describe how cultural similarities and differences in emotion\nperception or judgment can be obtained. This mechanism implies that judgments of emotion are\naffected by (1) a Facial Affect Recognition Program which is innate and universal (similar to Ekman and\nFriesen's Facial Affect Program), and (2) culture specific decoding rules that intensify, deintensify, mask,\nor qualify the perception (cf, Buck, 1984). I believe that this mechanism is as basic to emotion\ncommunication across cultures as Ekman and Friesen's original neurocultural theory, and we will revisit\nthis issue several times below.\nCultural differences in emotion recognition rates are related to stable and meaningful dimensions of\ncultural variability. Are cultural differences in emotion judgments related to interpretable dimensions of\nculture? To broaden the base of cultural dimensions that could explain cultural differences in agreement\nlevels, Matsumoto (1989) selected recognition data from fifteen cultures reported in four studies, and\nranked each culture on Hofstede's dimensions (1980). These included Power Distance (PD), the degree\nto which differences in power are maintained by culture; Uncertainty Avoidance (UA), the degree to\nwhich a culture develops institutions and rituals to deal with the anxiety created by uncertainty;\nIndividualism (IN), the degree to which a culture encourages the sacrificing of individual goals for the\ngoals of the group; and Masculinity (MA), the degree to which a culture emphasizes sex differences\n(Hofstede, 1980, 1983). The dimensions were then correlated with recognition accuracy levels.\nIndividualism was positively correlated with the recognition of happiness and negatively with sadness,\nsupporting the claim that Americans (individualistic culture) are better at recognizing negative emotions\nthan Japanese (collectivistic culture).\nDifferences in emotion perception as a function of culture were also found in a meta-analysis\n(Schimmack, 1996). Individualism was a better predictor of recognition of happiness than ethnicity\n(operationalized as Caucasian/non-Caucasian), supporting the notion that sociocultural dimensions\naccount for differences in the perception of emotion. They also support the notion that people of\ndifferent cultures learn ways of perception management via cultural decoding rules.\nBiehl et al. (1997) also reported cross-national differences in agreement (and in intensity ratings). These 103\ndifferences could not be adequately explained according to a Western/non-Western dichotomy, a\ndivision consistent with regional/country and racial/ethnic approaches to operationalizing culture.\nRather, Biehl et al. discussed these differences in terms of possible underlying sociopsychological\nvariables (i.e. those postulated by Hofstede 1980, 1983) and the dimensional approach to culture\nadvanced by Matsumoto (1989, 1990). Theoretical explanations and further testing of the relationship\nbetween culture and recognition should define culture according to meaningful sociopsychological\ndimensions above and beyond country, region, race or ethnicity.\nIn attributions of intensity. Are cultures similar or different in their judgments of the strength of an\nexpression? Cross-cultural research has documented cultural differences in the intensity attributed to\nthe facial expressions; Ekman et al.'s (1987) study of ten cultures was the first to do so. Although overall\nrecognition data supported universality, Asians gave significantly lower intensity ratings on happiness,\nsurprise, and fear. These data suggested that the judges were acting according to culturally learned rules\nabout how to perceive expressions, especially given the fact that all posers were Caucasian. That is, it\nwas possible that the Asians rated the Caucasian posers less intensely out of politeness or ignorance.\nTo examine this notion, Matsumoto and Ekman developed a stimulus set comprised of Asian and\nCaucasian posers (Matsumoto & Ekman, 1988) and presented them to judges in the US and Japan\n(Matsumoto & Ekman, 1989). For all but one emotion, Americans rated the expressions more intensely\nthan the Japanese, regardless of the race of the person being judged. Because the differences were not\nspecific to the poser, Matsumoto and Ekman (1989) interpreted the differences as a function of cultural\ndecoding rules.\nMatsumoto's (1989) study described earlier also investigated the relationship between Hofstede's\n(1980) dimensions of culture and emotion intensity ratings. Two important findings emerged. First,\nthere was a negative correlation between PD and intensity ratings of anger, fear, and sadness,\nsuggesting that cultures that emphasize status differences rate these emotions less intensely. Secondly,\nIN was positively correlated with intensity ratings of anger and fear; individualistic cultures gave higher\nratings. These results suggest that understanding dimensions of culture could be the key to explaining\ncultural differences in the perception of negative emotions.\nIn inferences about emotional experiences underlying facial expressions of emotion. Are people of\ndifferent cultures similar or different in how strongly they believe a person is actually feeling an emotion\nwhen judging it in others? Although cultures differed in their judgments of external display, it was\nunclear as to whether cultures also differed in their inferences about underlying experience, and if so,\nwhether these differences were similar to judgments of external display. Matsumoto, Kasri, and Kooken\n(1999) tested this notion by comparing American and Japanese judgments in which separate ratings\nwere obtained for expression intensity and subjective experience. Americans rated external display\nmore intensely than the Japanese, replicating previous findings. The Japanese, however, rated internal\nexperience more intensely than the Americans. Within-culture analyses indicated no significant\ndifferences between the two ratings for the Japanese. Significant differences were found, however, for\nthe Americans, who consistently rated external display more intensely than subjective experience.\nThese findings were totally unexpected. Previously, we suggested that American-Japanese differences\noccurred because the Japanese suppressed their intensity ratings, as they do their expressions.\nHowever, it was the Americans who exaggerated their external display ratings relative to subjective\nexperience, not the Japanese who suppressed. Not only are such findings wake-up calls to experienced\ncross-cultural researchers; they also force us to consider how culture produces these tendencies, and\nwhy. 104\nIn recognition and intensity ratings\nAre the cultural differences obtained in previous cross-cultural research observable among different\nethnic groups within the US? Matsumoto (1993) conducted a study that addressed this question,\nexamining ethnic differences in affect intensity, emotion judgments, display rule attitudes, and self-\nreported emotional expression within the American culture. African-Americans perceived anger more\nintensely than Asian-Americans, and disgust more intensely than Caucasian- and Asian-Americans;\nHispanic-Americans perceived Caucasian faces more intensely than did Caucasian-and Asian-Americans;\nand African-Americans perceived female expressions more intensely than did Asian-Americans. These\nfindings compel us to reevaluate the way we conceptualize culture, and stress the importance of\npsychologically meaningful dimensions of culture that are independent of ethnicity or country. Most\ncross-cultural research assumes that a person living in a country is a member of its primary culture.\nFinding differences within an American sample (which is nearly always the comparison group in cross-\ncultural studies) clearly demonstrates otherwise and urges us to consider meaningful psychological\ndimensions (e.g., individualism-collectivism, status differentiation) to explain cultural and individual\ndifferences in emotion expression and perception.\nIn attributions of personality based on smiles\nDo people of different cultures make different judgments of personality based on facial expressions? For\nexample, the smile is a common signal for greeting, acknowledgment, or for showing acceptance. It is\nalso employed to mask emotions, and cultures may differ in the use of smiles for this purpose. This\nappeared to be the case in Friesen's (1972) study in which Japanese and American men watched\ndisgusting video clips with an experimenter in the room with them. The Japanese men used smiles to\ncover up their negative expressions much more often than the American men (Ekman, 1972, Friesen,\n1972).\nTo investigate further the meaning of those differences, Matsumoto and Kudoh (1993) obtained ratings\nfrom Japanese and Americans on smiling versus non-smiling (i.e., neutral) faces with regard to\nintelligence, attractiveness, and sociability. Americans rated smiling faces as more intelligent than\nneutral faces; the Japanese, however, did not. Americans and Japanese both found smiling faces more\nsociable than neutral faces, but for the Americans the difference was to a greater degree. These\ndifferences suggest that cultural display rules cause Japanese and Americans to attribute different\nmeanings to the smile, and serve as a good explanation for perceived major differences in\ncommunication styles across cultures.\nSpeculations About Research on Culture and Emotion in the Next 15 Years\nThe next fifteen years will be exciting for research on culture and emotion. Interesting programs have\nsprung up not only in this country but around the world, and in all disciplines of psychology. New\ntechnologies for mapping culture as a psychological construct on the individual level are being\ndeveloped, as well as ways to measure precisely moment-to-moment changes in our brains and bodies\nwhen we feel or judge emotion. All of these promise the most exciting decade or two of research in the\nhistory of studies on culture and emotion. Below, I review four areas that I believe research on this topic\nwill challenge. These are not only my guesses; they are my hopes for where that research could and\nshould go. 105\nThe Integration of Culture, Psychology, and Biology\nNew and interesting research on emotion is currently being conducted on the physiological, cerebral,\nand neuroendocrinological correlates of emotion processes. Although not directly related to culture per\nse, they are exciting because of the possibility of branching across the various sub-disciplines within\nemotion research to integrate methods and concepts, producing studies that link culture as a macro-\nsocial construct with underlying biological processes. I outline three such examples below.\nCulture and the physiology of emotion. In history, there has been some controversy about the\nrelationship between physiology and emotion. Early writers (e.g., James, 1892) suggested that\nrecognition and awareness of our bodily reactions is what we then label an emotion. Others suggested\nthat some sort of physiological arousal is necessary for emotion, but the exact labeling of the emotion is\ndependent on the cues available to us in the environment (e.g., Schachter & Singer, 1962). Yet others\nhave suggested that no physiology at all is necessary for emotion (e.g., Mandler, 1984).\nDespite these early controversies, new studies have shown that our physiological reactions are indeed\nspecific to each of the emotions that are universal (Ekman, Levenson, & Friesen, 1983). These findings\ninclude responses of both the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the central nervous system (CNS).\nWe do not know, however, if these responses are universal. Research may uncover how and why culture\ninfluences physiology, hopefully linking physiology with culture as an individual-level as well as social-\nlevel construct, specifying the exact dimension of culture that influences physiology rather than relying\non national or ethnic/racial methods of classifying participants. Also, these studies will hopefully\nincorporate neuroendocrine function, examining the universality of hormonal changes in relation to\nemotion. Some studies have already paved the way for this research, such as Scherer's work on self-\nreported physiological sensations (Scherer, Wallbott, & Summerfield, 1983), and Levenson's (Tsai &\nLevenson, 1997) work on Chinese v. European American participants.\nThe representation of cultural display rules in the brain. Although the existence of cultural display rules\nis well accepted in contemporary psychology, surprisingly little is known about its exact nature, either\npsychologically or physiologically. As technology that allows moment-to-moment measurement of brain\nactivity develops, we can examine how these rules are represented in the brain. While certain brain\nareas are sure to store the verbal rules of display semantically (e.g., big boys don't cry), it is unclear as to\nhow these propositions are accessed during an actual emotion episode. My hunch is that there may be\ncross-cultural commonality in the brain sites that store display rule propositions, as well as sites in the\nlimbic system that drive the biologically innate functions of arousal and expression. But, I suspect that\nthere are cultural differences in how these areas are accessed and the degree of intercommunication\nacross areas. The ability to test this hypothesis, however, requires that we are able to map brain\nfunctioning and intra-brain communication among multiple brain sites in less-than-a-second intervals, a\ntechnology currently unavailable.\nThe representation of emotion perception in the brain. We also have little knowledge about how\nuniversal and culture specific aspects of emotion judgment are represented in the brain. Some brain\nareas are specific to face recognition and processing, but there is no research examining what areas of\nthe brain are activated when emotions are judged. That facial expressions of emotion are universally\nrecognized suggests that the brain areas involved in recognition processes are pancultural. Specific brain\nareas and intra-brain functioning, however, may be different for different emotions and judgment\nprocesses (e.g., judgments of display or experience intensity). Again, limitations in our ability to measure\nbrain activity make this line of research impossible today, but a realization soon. 106\nCulture, Context, and Emotion\nOne frontier facing emotion research concerns the effect of context on experiencing, expressing, and\nperceiving emotions, and the influence of culture on the relationship between context and emotion. To\nbe sure, much of the emphasis in the field in the last 30 years was on the establishment of universality;\nresearch documenting differences has only appeared in the last 10 or 15 years. As these increase, they\nbeg questions concerning the role of context in shaping emotion, and the influence of culture in this\nprocess. How does whom you are with, where you are, what is happening, when and why it is occurring,\naffect your emotional experiences, expressions, and judgments? If you are angry at your boss, does that\naffect how you display your emotions when you are at work, as opposed to when you are angry with\nyour spouse? Do these parameters of context have the same meaning for each of the different\nemotions? And, do these context parameters have different effects, meanings, and influence on the\nprocess of emotion in different cultures? These are obviously important questions not only for theories\nof emotion and culture in psychology, but also for practical and applied purposes. Cross-cultural\nresearch, however, is yet to systematically explore these important questions. Below I outline two\npotential areas of study, of many, that challenge the field in the next two decades.\nContext effects on judgments of emotion. A number of studies has examined the effect of context on\nemotion judgment, some manipulating the context of the observer (e.g., Fernandez-Dols, Wallbott, &\nSanchez, 1991; Munn, 1940), others manipulating the context of the poser (e.g., Carroll & Russell, 1996;\nKnudsen & Muzekari, 1983). While both areas are valid, studies of the latter are more worthwhile to the\nfield. To my knowledge, however, there has been no study that has examined all the possible\nparameters of context - the who, what, when, where, and why of emotion - and their effects on\nelicitation, expression, or perception. Research needs to manipulate experimentally all of these\nsimultaneously in a factorial design to investigate their effects on judgments. This research needs to\ninclude expressions of varying type and intensity, and multiple judgment options. What little research\nthat exists in this area to date falls sorely short of these ideals. These studies also need to examine how\nthe effects of context differ across cultures. Such research will have important implications to our\nunderstanding of intercultural communication and conflict.\nFolk psychology and display rules. As mentioned above, surprisingly little is known about the nature of\ndisplay rules. Display rules can be theoretically understood via folk psychology - as a set of propositions\nand beliefs that are integrated to produce behavioral outcomes. Culture supposedly supplies the\npropositions and beliefs, and the nature of the integration. Future research can focus on uncovering the\nnature of these propositions and beliefs, and how the integration works. These propositions will need to\naccount for the variety of contexts within which emotion can occur. Constructs distilled from these\npropositions in specific contexts that are generalizable across contexts may be considered cultural\ndisplay rule values that guide our actions and behaviors. Much work already exists in terms of the\nappraisal processes involved in emotion arousal, and these need to be incorporated into folk\npsychological research on display rules; they comprise much of the semantic information necessary for\naction on the propositions to occur. Folk psychological theories that account for cultural display rules in\none culture subsequently need to be studied across cultures. My hunch is that there is pancultural\nsimilarity in the structure of the semantic engine that drives display rules, and in much of the processes\nin which this engine engages to act upon propositions and beliefs to produce behaviors. Cultures will\nprobably differ, however, in the nature of the propositions and beliefs.\nCulture and the Social Significance of Emotion 107\nEmotions have social as well as personal meaning, and we need to know what role emotion plays in\ncreating, maintaining, or destroying interpersonal relationships, and how these processes are similar or\ndifferent across cultures. Kemper (1978) suggested that emotions could be classified into two types -\nsocially integrating emotions and socially differentiating emotions, the former helping people stay\ntogether, the latter breaking bonds among people. Kitayama, Markus, and Matsumoto (1995) proposed\na similar distinction, differentiating between socially engaged and disengaged types, the former\nenhancing interdependence with others, the latter enhancing independence from others. Kitayama et\nal. (1995) demonstrated that such distinctions can be useful in describing cultural differences in the\nemotional lives of people of different cultural backgrounds. In their study, people in the individualistic\nAmerican culture experienced socially disengaged emotions more frequently, while people of a more\ncollectivistic Japanese culture experienced socially engaged emotions more frequently.\nFuture research needs to explore these, and other, possible social roles of emotion. While previous\napproaches, however, have classified emotions into mutually exclusive dichotomies, I believe that\nemotions are complex enough that they can serve both integrating and differentiating, socially engaging\nas well as disengaging, roles depending on social context. For example, sadness felt at the death of a\nloved one may bond grieving parties together. Sadness that occurs because of a moral transgression of a\nfriend, however, may serve to drive people apart. The same could be said of anger, happiness, and all\nother emotions in our affective spectrum. If this is true, future research must investigate not which\nemotions are integrating and which are differentiating, but instead the parameters and contexts that\nallow an emotion to be both integrating and differentiating, and why. I speculate that there would be\ncross-cultural similarities in the cultural rules regarding the social roles of emotion, but that there would\nbe cultural differences in exactly which emotions played those roles. Cross-cultural research focusing\nentirely on emotions as the unit of analysis may not be as fruitful as focusing on the social functions they\nplay.\nCulture and Emotion in Interaction\nAs we learn more about the social and personal meanings of emotion, we gain valuable information\nabout the role of emotion in intercultural and interpersonal communication episodes, and the influence\nof culture on this process. Many writers (e.g., Bennett, 1993; Gudykunst, Matsumoto, Ting-Toomey,\nNishida, Kim, & Heyman, 1996) have suggested that emotion plays a key role in intercultural\ncommunication, focusing especially on anxiety attendant to the uncertainty in intercultural\ncommunication, and the fear, anger, and distress that often occurs in intercultural misunderstandings.\nNonverbal aspects of communication far outweigh the verbal in communication, and much of the\nnonverbal information is emotional. Indeed, successful communication of emotions may be considered\na necessary (and sometimes sufficient?) ingredient to successful intercultural communication. If true,\nfuture research on intercultural communication must focus more on nonverbal emotions. In particular,\nthe regulation of emotional reactions to unintended gaffes may be a gateway to being able to think\ncritically about events and harboring the openness and flexibility to accept rival hypotheses about the\ncauses of these offenses. The relationship between emotions, values, and reinforcement of self also\nneeds further exploration. I speculate that people of different cultures are similar in the processes\nunderlying intercultural communication, but differ in the role of specific emotions within the process.\nSpeculations About Research in Cross-cultural Psychology in the Next 15 Years\nCultural differences challenge mainstream theoretical notions about the nature of people and force us 108\nto rethink our basic theories of personality, perception, cognition, emotion, development, social\npsychology, and the like, in fundamental and profound ways. We are on the verge of witnessing\nencyclopedic-type compendia of cultural differences in almost all subfields of psychology with ample\nevidence from many cultures of how truths of mainstream Americans are not necessarily applicable to\nthe rest of the world. This overwhelming evidence brings with them an obligation for us to make some\nsense of it all. The biggest challenge facing cross-cultural psychology today and in the future is not in the\ncontinued compilation of cultural differences in various facets of psychology. Instead, it is in the\ndevelopment of theoretical models and conceptual frameworks that can explain how cultures are both\nsimilar and different, and why, and in the integration of these frameworks into mainstream academic\npsychology. In short, we need to stop and think about what it all means.\nThe Development of Theoretical Models To Explain Cultural Similarities and Differences\nFortunately, a small but growing number of cross-cultural psychologists has been interested in\ndiscovering how cultures come to create similarities and differences and why. Many have turned their\nefforts to studying the developmental processes underlying enculturation - the process of learning the\nrules, values, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and opinions of your first, original culture - and have made\nimportant inroads to understanding how we acquire culture and how it influences our lives (see reviews\nby Gardiner, Mutter, & Kosmitzki, 1998; Matsumoto, 1999a). Another important inroad concerns work\non the relationship between culture and self-concept as a mediator of psychological differences across\ncultures (see Matsumoto, 1999b, for a review). A third avenue has been the use of meaningful\ndimensions of cultural variability such as Individualism-collectivism (IC) to predict and explain cultural\nsimilarities and differences observed in research and observation.\nIn fact, much emphasis has been given recently to IC. Individualistic cultures foster a unique sense of self\nand autonomy, clearly delineating boundaries between oneself and others, encouraging the needs,\nwishes, desires of individuals over group or collective concerns. Collectivistic cultures, however, foster\nneeds, wishes, and desires of ingroups over those of individuals, valuing harmony, cooperation,\ncohesion, and conformity.\nIC has been used by many to predict and explain cultural differences in a wide variety of psychological\nconstructs (see review by Triandis, 1995). This construct is a major gain for cross-cultural research and\nthinking because it allows authors to go beyond nationality, race, or ethnicity in predicting and\nexplaining differences, and instead focuses on functional psychological predictions and interpretations\nof data. Constructs like IC give researchers and theoreticians alike a basis by which they can understand\nthe psychological impact of culture on both the macro-social as well as individual levels. The study\nreviewed earlier linking cultural differences in judgments of emotion with Hofstede's (1980) dimensions\nof cultural variability is an example of such research (Matsumoto, 1989).\nRecent advances in cross-cultural methods include the development of ways to measure IC tendencies\non the individual level. Triandis (Triandis, Leung, Villareal, & Clack, 1985) refers to these tendencies as\nidiocentrism and allocentrism, and their measurement is a major plus for research. They allow\nresearchers to empirically ascertain that their samples differ on this construct, providing an important\nmethodological check and eliminating reliance on anecdotes, impressions, or stereotype when\ninterpreting findings. They also allow researchers to assess numerically the degree of within-culture\nvariability on this important construct. Using this index, researchers can determine how much of the\ndifference between the groups are attributable to individual level differences in IC. 109\nSay, for example, that a researcher intends to compare two cultures where all participants completed an\nindividual level measurement of IC. Group differences on the dependent variable could be tested\nthrough normal procedures (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.). In addition, the relationship between\nIC and the dependent variable could be assessed through correlational procedures. If correlations\nexisted, their influence on the group differences obtained earlier could be tested using multiple\nregression or analysis of covariance (ANACOVA). The degree of contribution of IC to the group\ndifferences could be computed by comparing effect sizes of the group between the original and\nANACOVA analyses.\nThere are many choices today as to the method of IC measurement. The leading methods were\ndeveloped by Triandis and his colleagues (see appendix in Triandis, 1995, for review). Recent approaches\ninvolve a multi-method approach assessing IC tendencies across attitudes, values, opinions, and beliefs.\nSingelis, Triandis, Bhawuk, and Gelfand (1995) have also developed measurement procedures to assess\nhorizontal and vertical IC. Hui (1988) developed a context-specific method of measurement, while\nYamaguchi (1994) has developed more specific measures of collectivism. We have also developed a\nmeasure of IC tendencies in specific contexts based on social interaction (Matsumoto et al., 1997).\nThe field is embracing these measures in cross-cultural comparisons. These developments are a major\nplus, as they relegate culture to functional psychology, giving us a basis to understand how and why\nsimilarities and differences occur. They allow for valuable methodological checks in our research, and for\nstatistical assessments of the contribution of measured culture to observed differences. The approach,\ntherefore, is unique, promising, and innovative. However, I do want to mention the importance of\nanother cultural dimension - power distance or status differentiation. The field has been almost too\npreoccupied with IC to the exclusion of other important dimensions. To be sure, no one dimension can\ncapture \"culture\" as we know it. Yet, how a culture deals with power and status differences is just as\nimportant, if not more so, than IC. Future endeavors should include the development of individual level\nmeasures of this important cultural construct as well, and integrate it into cross-cultural research.\nThe Integration of Cross-cultural Theories into Mainstream Academic Psychology\nResearch on bilingualism has demonstrated that bilinguals seem to access two cultural frames of\nreferences, depending on which language they speak (see Matsumoto, 1999a for a review of this\nliterature). Bilinguals have reported different personalities, judge emotions differently, appraise events\nand the environment around them differently, and attribute the causes of events differently depending\non the language used when performing these tasks. Not only do multiple cultural frameworks exist in\ntheir minds, but bilinguals also have the added ability to monitor which cultural framework they should\nengage in depending on the social context. Thus, they have a meta-cognitive process that allows them\nto engage with their \"multiple personalities\" in a healthy and constructive way. This ability is related to\nthe development of intercultural sensitivity (e.g., see Bennett, 1993).\nMost Americans are monolingual; yet, most of the rest of the world is multilingual. This suggests that\nthe information obtained from research with Americans, and theories derived from Americans by\nAmericans, may be based on a theory of mind that is fundamentally different than the rest of the world.\nWe may not think twice about whether those theories make sense to us or not, because they are\nbounded within the same cultural framework as ourselves. It is only when we look outside of ourselves\nwhen we can experience, understand, and appreciate, those boundaries.\nMainstream psychology, therefore, has a lot of catching up to do. The assimilation of cross-cultural 110\nfindings and theories into mainstream psychology suggests a fundamental revision in ways of thinking of\nself and personality that have important consequences for all areas of psychology. No information or\nideas that we have currently need to be thrown out. They just need to be placed within the proper\ncontext to be understood and applicable for the most appropriate people. Cross-cultural work needs to\nbe assimilated into mainstream psychology, and mainstream psychology needs to accommodate to\nthese ideas. The end product will be qualitatively different than the psychology we are currently\naccustomed.\nWhere do we take up the challenge? The fight, if you will, is not in the laboratory or field. It is, instead,\nin ourselves. The greatest challenge facing cross-cultural psychology now is to think less about producing\nfinding after finding of cultural differences, and to think more about ways of integrating them\ncollectively into a cohesive, comprehensive theory incorporating mainstream as well as cross-cultural\npsychology. This is a challenge also for all the subfields of psychology, which are splintered fragments of\na larger collective. While the need for specificity and fragmentation is understandable, so is the need for\nintegration and synthesis. This requires that we look outside of psychology to \"put the pieces back\ntogether;\" otherwise, we never envision the whole, only parts of the whole. This integration may require\nus to consult with anthropology, sociology, business, medicine, and other disciplines. In developing\ntheoretical models to integrate cultural similarities and differences, we need to go outside of psychology\nto know more about psychology. This new approach need not be forced, nor need the revisions be\nhorrendously traumatic. Little steps will turn to big steps, and big steps will be a journey. In the end, it is\nthe walking, not the destination, that is the desired end. Are cross-cultural psychologists up to the task?\nAre psychologists up to the task?\nAdvice for Those Breaking Into this Field\nI have four suggestions for people wanting to break into psychology in general, and cross-cultural\npsychology in particular. Other writers will have many other excellent advices for those crazy enough to\nwant to do so, but these are the kinds of things that have helped me along in my career.\n1. Get Grounded in Academic Psychology\nGet a solid grounding in the methods of contemporary academic psychology. Take as many classes on\nresearch methods and statistics as you can. Challenge instructors of your content courses about\nmethods and statistics. Work in a research laboratory as an apprentice with someone who is will to take\nyou under his or her wing and show you the ropes. Volunteer. Do a lot of research, make a lot of\nmistakes, and take time to think a lot on the way. Polish your skills at not only doing research, but\nlearning how to think logically, rationally, and critically. Learn how to use a computer and analyze your\nown data. Be able to do everything in a study from start to finish, and do it well.\n2. Get Exposed to the Variety of Human Behavior\nGet a lot of life experience. Have friends. Take time for love and relationships. Work in a clinical setting.\nExperience people with psychopathology. Experience the range of human emotions - from the\npenultimate joys of accomplishment to the depths of anguish and despair of loss. As a psychologist,\nunderstand people from an emotional standpoint, not only from a cognitive/research standpoint. You\ncan't learn about the taste of strawberries by reading about it in a book.\n3. Get Experience in an Unfamiliar Culture\nTravel, but not just as a tourist. Learn about the customs, ways, and lifestyles of different people. Learn\nhow they think, experience emotions, and experience life. Learn another language, and get to the point 111\nwhere you are fluent in it. Learn to accept, appreciate, and respect cultural diversity. Become\nmulticultural yourself. It is an entirely different plane of being.\n4. Put it all Together\nFinally, put it all together. Take your life experiences seeing the range of human behavior, your\nknowledge and appreciation of culture, and the academic skills you have learned, and integrate them\ninto a meaningful career that teaches the rest of us something that we don't already know. Make the\nworld a better place. The next frontier for psychology is the culture, and the next generation of\npsychologists armed with these skills will be those who are ready for that journey.\nGood luck in that journey.\nReferences\nBennett, M.

Sternberg,\nYale University\nIn the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, written over one hundred\nyears ago in 1886, a basically well-meaning, well-mannered doctor, Dr. Jekyll, makes a discovery that\nenables him temporarily to transform himself into a hideous monster of a man, Mr. Hyde. At first, the\ndiscovery is merely a curiosity. But gradually the alter ego, Hyde, begins to dominate Dr. Jekyll, until, of\ncourse, tragedy strikes. Eventually, Mr. Hyde takes over. Early death puts an end simultaneously to both\nJekyll and Hyde, as it must, because the two individuals share but a single body.\nThe field of intelligence has many of the characteristics of a Jekyll and Hyde relationship. It has been and\ncontinues to be, in many respects, well-meaning and well-mannered, offering the possibility of doing\ngood for science and for the public. But the field also has an ugly side, which continually seems to be\ntrying to dominate its good side. The question remains as to whether one side will ultimately dominate\nthe other, or whether, as is more likely, the two sides will continue to live together in an uneasy truce as\ntime passes by.\nThe field of intelligence has had its Jekyll and Hyde sides for me personally, which is why I entered the\nfield in the first place. I became interested in intelligence when, as an elementary-school student, I did\npoorly on IQ tests. In fact, I did so poorly that in sixth grade I was sent back to a fifth-grade classroom to\nretake the fifth-grade intelligence test. In a sense, my professional career has been an attempt to\nunderstand and come to terms with my own early failures on these tests!\nIt is important to realize that this Jekyll-and-Hyde dualism is not limited to the field of intelligence.\nConsider physics: Is nuclear power good or bad? Potentially, it is either or both. Or try biology: Is gene\nsplicing good or bad? It can be either, or both. In field after field, there is the potential for good or bad.\nWhat decides which way things go is not the knowledge base, but the people who use it for wise or\nunwise ends (Sternberg, 1998). How knowledge is used is always a choice. Thus, students need not only\nacquire knowledge, but the wisdom to use the knowledge for good ends.\nA Brief History Lesson\nThinking in the field of intelligence dates back at least to ancient philosophers such as Plato and\nAristotle. For example, in Book 5 of the Republic, Socrates asks Glaucon whether he is not in agreement\nthat a gifted individual is one who easily acquires knowledge and tends to remember it, in contrast to\nthe less gifted individual who acquires knowledge only with great difficulty, and then tends to forget it.\nGlaucon, of course, agrees. Who can disagree with Socrates, other than those of his contemporaries\nwho put him to death? Aristotle, in Posterior Analytics Book I, conceives of intelligence in terms of\n\"quick wit,\" which is the notion of hitting on ideas instantly. Such ancient thinking was rather harmless,\nbut some more modern thinking has not been.\nWhat is Intelligence? 117\nThe issue of the nature of intelligence was important in ancient Greece and continues to form today a\nfundamental issue in the psychology of intelligence. What makes the issue so important?\nImportance of Issue\nFirst, we use many different kinds of tests to measure intelligence. But before we measure intelligence,\ncertainly we ought to seriously consider just what it is we are measuring. Otherwise, we run the risk of\nmeasuring the wrong thing. If we are going to use these tests to make high-stakes decisions, such as\nabout tracking in schools or admission to colleges, universities, and professional schools, we especially\nshould make sure we are measuring the right thing. This problem is not limited to intelligence. If we\nwant, say, to sort children or adults on creativity, \"good personality,\" or \"good values,\" we also need a\nsense of just what we mean by these things before we blindly sort by them.\nSecond, when we start measuring something before we know what it is, we run the proverbial risk of\nputting the cart before the horse. Instead of ideas driving measurement, measurement ends up driving\nideas. We may end up manipulating our theories to fit our measurements, rather than the other way\naround. Most likely, we will measure what is easiest to measure, and then end up creating theories that\njustify these measurements after the fact.\nModern thinking about intelligence is usually dated back to Sir Francis Galton (1883), who proposed that\nintelligence could be understood in terms of the qualities of energy and sensitivity. Galton had much\nthat was positive to say about those who were well endowed with intelligence, but much that was\nnegative to say about individuals and groups of individuals in what he believed to be the lower ranges of\nintelligence. Galton thus exhibited early the Mr. Hyde lurking in the background of work in intelligence.\nFor example, Galton believed that\nThe discriminative facility of idiots is curiously low; they hardly distinguish between heat and cold, and\ntheir sense of pain is so obtuse that some of the more idiotic seem hardly to know what it is. In their dull\nlives, such pain as can be excited in them may literally be accepted with a welcome surprise. (p. 28)\nGiven that Galton believed that idiots were ones who did poorly on psychophysical tests of visual,\nauditory, haptic, and other forms of acuity and discrimination, one shudders to think of the implications\nof Galton's views for those who were on the lower end of what Gardner (1983) has more recently\ndubbed \"bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.\" You want to do them a favor? Give them some pain as a gift\nthat will excite in them a welcome surprise. In this and other writings, Galton made no effort to hide the\nHyde side. Fortunately, at least for a time, his views more or less died.\nBinet and Simon (1916) devised a test to measure intelligence that was based not on psychophysical\nacuity and discrimination, but on judgment. Their test had a distinctly Jekyll-like character to it. Their\npurpose was to determine which students would learn well in school. They also were trying to save\nchildren who were behavior problems in school from being relegated to special classes or schools for the\nmentally retarded. At the time, teachers did not clearly distinguish between behavioral and mental\nproblems, and often the teachers would assume that bad behavior was tantamount to mental\nretardation. Such an assumption had the Hyde-like advantage of giving teachers a quick way to get rid of\nstudents they didn't want in their classes. Thus, the intelligence tests of Binet and Simon were designed\nto protect students, in Jekyll-like fashion, from Hyde-like decisions that could ruin their careers and their\nlives. 118\nThe problem is that the two faces of selection and retention are so easily reversed. Just as tests can be\nused to preserve talent, so can they be used to rid society or other groups of individuals who, for one\nreason or another, come to be viewed as undesirables. Indeed, some people believe that intelligence\ntests and related tests have come to be used in just such a way: They can provide a pseudo-scientific\nsmoke screen for rejecting people from the mainstream of society whom the society wants to reject for\nnonscientific reasons (Gould, 1981). Instead of rejecting the people on the basis of their ethnic or\nnational or other group, one creates a test that appears to give an objective reason for their exclusion.\nGould's (1981) recounting of events is sometimes in devoted service of his message, and so one needs\nto exert caution in accepting some of his conclusions. But there can be little doubt that, de facto, tests\nhave tended to favor certain groups over others, for whatever reason (Sternberg, 1996). This fact\nillustrates an additional complexity in the study of intelligence as applied to society. When certain\ngroups do more poorly on intelligence tests than others, there are those who believe that the difference\nreflects the Dr. Jekylls of psychology who create the kind of fair meritocracy that our country should be,\nand there are others who believe that the difference reflects the Dr. Hydes of psychology who legitimize\ninstitutional discrimination against the unfortunate. In other words, unlike in the novel, it is not always\ntotally clear who is Jekyll and who is Hyde.\nAlthough a major conflict regarding testing was between Galton and Binet, a main conflict regarding\ntheory was between Charles Spearman (1904) and Louis Thurstone (1938). Spearman believed that\nperformance of cognitive tasks requires two kinds of abilities, a general ability (g) common to all of the\ntasks, and specific abilities each relevant to just a single task. Thurstone, in contrast, believed that no\nsingle ability existed, but rather, that there are multiple primary mental abilities, such as verbal-\ncomprehension ability, numerical ability, and spatial ability. The conflict between unitary and multiple\nconceptions of intelligence has carried down even to the present day.\nContemporary Theories of Intelligence\nToday, the question of what intelligence is remains as hot as it was in the days of the differences\nbetween the views of Galton and Binet (Sternberg, 2000). Some investigators are actively attempting to\nexpand our notions of intelligence. Two examples are the work of Howard Gardner and of myself.\nGardner (1983, 1993, 1999) has proposed a theory of multiple intelligences according to which\nintelligence comprises not just a single entity, but multiple ones, including linguistic, logical-\nmathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist\nintelligences. For example, when you write a paper, you are using primarily linguistic intelligence. When\nyou solve calculus or other mathematical problems, you are using primarily logical-mathematical\nintelligence. When you try to figure out why you procrastinate in your work, you are using intrapersonal\nintelligence. Gardner has also speculated as to the existence of existential and spiritual intelligences.\nAccording to Gardner, each of these multiple intelligences is more or less independent of the others.\nConventional tests of intelligence measure primarily linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences,\nand to some extent spatial intelligence, but ignore the other intelligences. Moreover, even the\nintelligences that are measured are assessed in ways that are very limited, such as through fairly trivial\nmultiple-choice kinds of questions. Thus, these tests can at best give only a limited picture of what\nchildren and even adults can do.\nI, too, believe that conventional tests give only a limited picture of what people can do, although my\nbeliefs originate in a somewhat different way. In my own work (Sternberg, 1985a, 1988, 1996, 1999b), I 119\nhave suggested a triarchic theory of intelligence, according to which there are three major aspects of\nintelligence: analytical, creative, and practical. Conventional tests of intelligence measure primarily\nanalytical abilities, and all but ignore creative and practical abilities. The result is that people who might\nhave very important contributions to make to society may be derailed early in their lives because they\ndo not do well on conventional tests.\nI sometimes refer to my own theory as the theory of }successful intelligence,\" because I place emphasis\nnot just on predicting success in schoolwork, but also, predicting success in life. Intelligence tests were\noriginally created to predict success in school, but there is much more to life than school, of course. The\nquestion then arises as to what, exactly, success is. According to my theory, success is what you believe\nit is, so long as you are defining it in a prosocial way. So it success could be life as a teacher for one\nperson, as a carpenter for another. But being an axe-murderer does not count because it is antisocial\nrather than prosocial.\nGardner's and my own theories are sometimes presented as though they are \"alternative\" theories of\nintelligence. Indeed, in almost all of the introductory-psychology texts, they are presented in this way.\nBut in fact, they deal with somewhat different aspects of intelligence. Gardner's theory deals with\ndomains of intelligence, my own with processes within (or between) domains. Thus, one can think\nanalytically, creatively, or practically, for example, in the linguistic (or any other) domain, as when one\nanalyzes a work of literature (analytic), writes a poem (creative), or discusses the relevance of the\ntravails of a literary character for one's own life (practical). It is thus important in psychology to realize\nthat views that are presented as being in conflict with each other often only have the appearance of\nbeing in conflict. We must examine them rather carefully to determine whether the conflict is real or\napparent.\nRelation to General Issues in Cognitive Psychology\nThe issue of what intelligence is may seem remote from the concerns of cognitive psychology, in\ngeneral, but nothing could be further from the case. There are several reasons why this is so.\nFirst, many theorists view intelligence as the central set of abilities that organizes all cognitive functions\n(see, e.g., Anderson, 1983; Newell 1990; Schank, 1980; Sternberg, 1977, 1996, 1997). Thus, an\nunderstanding of what intelligence is would help us understand how all of cognition is organized and\neffectively brought to bear upon the tasks we face in our daily lives.\nSecond, the tension between Galton, on the one hand, and Binet, on the other, is a tension that has\nexisted in cognitive psychology since its inception, and that shows no sign of abating. This tension is\nbetween those who emphasize the sensory and perceptual functioning characteristic of bottom-up\nprocessing (as did Galton), and those who emphasize the judgmental and comprehension characteristic\nof top-down processing, (as did Binet). In bottom-up processing, one starts information processing at\nthe level of elementary sensory processes, and then builds up to more complex cognitive processes,\nsuch as reasoning. In top-down processing, one starts information processing at a complex level, and\nthen works down to more basic processes. The tension between the two kinds of processes can be seen\nin many areas of cognition. In the field of visual perception, for example, some theorists emphasize\nbottom-up perceptual processes (e.g., Gibson, 1979) whereas others emphasize top-down perceptual\nprocesses (e.g., Rock, 1983). A similar issue arises in speech perception, where some theories are more\nbottom-up (Massaro, 1987) and others are more top-down (Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, & Studdert-\nKennedy, 1967; Liberman & Mattingly, 1985). Theories of reading can also emphasize bottom-up or top- 120\ndown processing, although modern theories tend to seek a balance between the two emphases (e.g.,\nMcClelland & Rumelhart, 1981).\nThird, the nature of intelligence raises questions about the extent to which the mind is modular, a key\nquestion in contemporary cognitive psychology. Modularity refers to the minds being divided into\nmultiple systems of processing information that are largely independent of each other. For example, is\nthe intelligence you use to do your schoolwork in a different module, or functional part of the brain,\nthan is the intelligence you use to decide whether you like someone? In a much-cited book, Fodor\n(1983) argued that the mind is largely modular, except for higher intellectual processes. Gardner (1983),\nhowever, argued that even the higher intellectual processes are modular. The problem for a theory such\nas Gardner's, however, is adequately accounting for what Spearman (1904) called the positive manifold-\n-the tendency for tests of higher level intellectual abilities all to intercorrelate positively with each other.\nAt the very least, a hierarchical structure that somehow integrates the lower order modules seems to be\nnecessary to account for these intercorrelations (Carroll, 1993). Gardners theory, proposed more than\n15 years ago, still has not generated even a single empirical test. Until it does, the theory must be\nviewed as intriguing but, from a scientific viewpoint, as highly speculative. In particular, research is\nneeded to know whether the intelligences Gardner has proposed actually exist, are truly independent,\nand are measurable in reliable and valid ways.\nFinally, it is not clear that there even is any one answer to what intelligence is. A cognitive psychologist,\nUlrich Neisser (1974), pointed out that intelligence may be best conceived of as a prototype (Rosch,\n1978), or as a fuzzy concept. According to this view, we have conceptions of what characteristic features\nof intelligence might be but there are no necessary features that categorically distinguish intelligence\nfrom everything else. We have invented the concept to make sense of differences we see among people\nin everyday life. Different cultures may have different prototypes for intelligence (Sternberg & Kaufman,\n1998).\nRelation of the Nature of Intelligence to Everyday Life\nThe question of whether intelligence comprises a more general ability (Jensen, 1998), perhaps with\nsubsidiary abilities embedded hierarchically beneath it (Carroll, 1993; Cattell, 1971) or instead is\nmodular with no general factor (or at least none of importance; Gardner, 1983; Thurstone, 1938) is not\none just of theoretical importance. It has implications for our everyday lives. If intelligence comprises\nprimarily just one ability, then a single IQ (intelligence quotient) score can tell us pretty much what we\nneed to know about a person's intellectual abilities. If intelligence comprises multiple abilities, however,\nany single number (or two numbers, such as verbal and mathematics scores) will leave us with an\ninadequate account of a person's profile of intellectual abilities. The fight among theorists, therefore,\nhas implications for the practical realm. People who emphasize multiple abilities may well see people\nwho emphasize just a single ability as reactionary Mr. Hydes who allow their right-wing sociopolitical\nideology to corrupt their thinking because of their desire to suppress individuals--often members of\nminority groups--whose talents are not well captured by a single number. People who emphasize a\nsingle ability, however, may see the multiple-ability theorists as radical Mr. Hydes who allow their left-\nwing sociopolitical ideology to corrupt the integrity of their scientific thinking.\nIt is important to realize that the same general principle potentially applies to all thinking. Arguments\nabout the ethical justifiability of abortion and capital punishment go on and on, for example, and do not\nget resolved on the basis of intellectual discourse. Ideology creeps into these arguments, as surely as it 121\ncreeps into arguments about psychological issues. We all always need to be aware of how our ideology\nunconsciously shapes our thinking.\nOf course, questions about what intelligence is are not the only ones at the forefront of modern\npsychological investigations. Another key question is how intelligence, whatever it is, should be\ninvestigated.\nHow Should Intelligence be Investigated?\nIt would seem as though how one would go about investigating something--say, intelligence--would\ndepend on just what the thing is that one was investigating. Thus, the answer to the question of how\nintelligence should be investigated would seem to depend on what intelligence is, much as the question\nof how, say, a crime should be investigated would depend on what the crime is. One would not\ninvestigate a murder in quite the same way as one would investigate a land swindle. So how should\nintelligence be investigated?\nImportance of Issue\nHistorically, the question of methods of investigation has, if anything, preceded rather than followed the\nquestion of what is being investigated in the field of intelligence. Methods have become available, and\nthey have driven, to a large extent, how intelligence is conceived (see Sternberg, 1990). Although\nmethods can certainly be helpful in driving substantive research (Gigerenzer, 1991), they can also lead\nto the situation where the methods, rather than the construct, drive research. In other words, the cart is\nplaced before the horse.\nTo a large extent, how one investigates something can determine what one can find out about that\nsomething. For example, if one is investigating a murder, reliance on eyewitness testimony may suggest\na suspect different from the suspect suggested by DNA analysis. Neither kind of testimony is infallible:\nRecall of eyewitnesses is often quite poor (Loftus, 1975; Loftus & Ketcham, 1991), and evidence with\nDNA in it may be planted at the scene of a crime to point the figure toward a targeted suspect. Similarly\nno one method for studying intelligence or anything else is infallible: Ideally, we want to use converging\noperations that help us understand a construct as a result of multiple kinds of analysis (Garner, Hake, &\nEriksen, 1956). The importance of method, then, is that it may in large part determine the outcome; but\nthe users of the method may not recognize the contribution of method to the determination of that\noutcome. This issue is not just hypothetical. Multiple-choice tests tend to correlate with each other, but\nthey do not correlate as well with essay and other performance-based tests. Which kind of test is used\nhas a major effect on how a person's intelligence is evaluated (Sternberg, 1996; Sternberg, Ferrari,\nClinkenbeard, & Grigorenko, 1996). Thus, who is identified as intelligent may depend in large part upon\nthe method used to identify different levels of intelligence.\nContemporary Methods for Studying Intelligence\nMany different methods have been used to investigate intelligence (Sternberg, 1982, 1990, 2000), but\nhere I will concentrate on just two methodologies--factor analysis, which has its origins in differential\npsychology (Spearman, 1904), and cognitive analysis, which has its origins in experimental psychology\n(e.g., Donders, 1868). 122\nThe differential approach. Factor analysis is a technique that takes correlations--which represent\npatterns of individual differences shared across tests or other measurements--and attempts to find the\nlatent mental (or other) structures that underlie, or give rise to these correlations. So, for example, if\none were to give tests of vocabulary, verbal analogies, understanding of mathematical concepts, and\nmathematical problem solving, a factor analysis might plausibly reveal two factors, or latent sources of\nindividual differences--verbal and mathematical abilities. The idea would be that underlying all the tests\nare just two fundamental abilitiestverbal and mathematical. You could be strong verbally but not\nmathematically, or vice versa. Or you could be strong or weak in both. Because the factors are separate,\nthe abilities are largely independent.\nFactor analysis has been widely used as a basis for understanding intelligence (see Carroll, 1982, 1993;\nJensen, 1998), and continues to be a major source of information about abilities. Some psychologists,\nhowever, have been less than satisfied with this methodology as a sole or even primary basis for\nunderstanding mental abilities (e.g., Sternberg, 1977). Why?\nFirst, the identification of abilities through factor analysis is dependent on there being individual\ndifferences in those abilities. If there are no individual differences, there can be no meaningful\ncorrelations between pairs of tests, and thus no factors can be revealed. But not all abilities yield salient\nindividual differences. For example, the ability to use language is certainly a part of intelligence. One\ncharacteristic that separates human intelligence from that of most or even all other animals is the ability\nto use language. But virtually all humans have this ability, so the existence of linguistic ability is not\nsusceptible to identification by factor analysis (although variations in levels of it usually will be).\nSecond, factor analysis may be useful as a structural model, but it typically tells us little or perhaps even\nnothing about the mental processes underlying intelligence. One can imagine factor analysis as revealing\na map of the mind (Sternberg, 1990)--a representation of the terrain of how abilities are distributed. But\nfactor analysis would not tell us how people navigate that terrain, or make effective use of it.\nThird, conventional (so-called exploratory) factor analysis does not yield unique solutions. Imagine a\nmap of the world. The locations of the sites on the map (cities, mountains, oceans, or whatever) are\nfixed, but the axes used to assign meaning to these locations are not. Typically, we use lines of longitude\nand latitude, so that we can make meaningful judgments about how far north or south, or east or west,\na given site is. But there is no particular reason to use lines of longitude and latitude. We might use polar\ncoordinates or some other system of coordinates. Similarly, in factor analysis, interpretation of results\ndepends heavily on where factorial axes are drawn; but as with the map, there are an infinite number of\naxes we might draw that could be used uniquely to locate sites, in this case, in the factor space.\nIn sum, factor analysis is far from a perfect method for studying intelligence. Does cognitive analysis\nprovide a more nearly perfect method of analysis, or at least, a better one?\nThe cognitive approach. The cognitive analysis of intelligence starts in a place quite different from that\nof the factor (differential) analysis of intelligence. The goal is to unpack variation in difficulties among\ntasks rather than variation in performance among people. In other words, the parameters that are\nisolated from the method of analysis are based upon stimulus rather than upon person properties.\nFor example, in some of my early work, I was interested in the role of inductive reasoning (a major part\nof what is called \"fluid abilities\" in the literature on differential psychology) in intelligence. I therefore 123\nhad experimental participants solve fairly simple analogy, classification, and series-completion problems\nwhile they were timed by a machine (Sternberg, 1977; Sternberg, 1983; Sternberg & Gardner, 1983).\nItems were carefully selected for their stimulus properties so that they would vary in difficulty. For\nexample, an analogy (such as DOCTOR : LAWYER :: PATIENT : a. CLIENT, b. JUDGE) might vary in the\ncomplexity of the relation between the first two terms of the analogy, or the first and third, and so\nforth. Ultimately, processes of inductive reasoning were identified such as inference--required to\nunderstand the relation between the first two terms of the analogy--andapplication--required to carry\nover the rule inferred in the first half of the analogy to solve the problem in the second half. These\nprocesses were identified on the basis of differential patterns of response times across items rather than\nacross persons (as would be typical in factor analysis).\nIn the 1980s, the prospects for what at the time seemed to be a revolutionary approach to intelligence\nwere rosy indeed. Those of us engaged in the cognitive analysis of intelligence (such as Carroll, 1976;\nHunt, 1980; Pellegrino & Glaser, 1980; and Snow, 1980) thought that we had found the cure for the ills\nof the field of intelligence. Perhaps we were insensitive, though, to the dialectical nature of science, in\ngeneral, and psychology, in particular (Sternberg, 1995, 1999a).\nRelation to General Issues in Cognitive Psychology\nIn the dialectic, a given approach to a problem is offered--say, the psychometric one. In the terms of the\ndialectic, it is called a thesis. Proponents of it view themselves as the Jekylls of the field: They have an\nanswer--one that will help enlighten and benefit all. But not everyone sees the thesis so positively.\nSkeptics come along, and view those promoting the thesis as the Hydes of the field. At best, they are\nunenlightened; at worst, they are reactionary enemies of progress. These skeptics pose an antithesis\nthat is critical of the thesis on one and usually more than one dimension. Thus, the cognitivists viewed\nthemselves as offering an antithesis to the differentialists--perhaps even the panacea intelligence\nresearch had been looking for.\nAs always happens, the supposed panacea proves to be nothing of the sort. Critics internal and external\nto the antithetical movement begin to see flaws. Thus, in my own work, I began to see cognitive\npsychologists as using pretty much the same kinds of test questions as had differentialists, with the main\ndifference between the two groups in the way they were dividing up the same variance (Sternberg,\n1985a). Moreover, information-processing analyses of intelligence were not working out the way they\nwere supposed to. Often, the variation that best correlated with conventional psychometric tests was\nthat in the regression constant--what was common to all of the test items being studied. It seemed\nalmost as though general ability (g) had been rediscovered. Finally, just as some of the factor analysts\nhad seemed to be mindlessly applying factor analysis to every data set in sight, so were cognitivists\nshown to be capable of applying cognitive analysis to every task in sight without asking whether the task\nwas the right one to use. Cognitive analysis became just as task-based as had factor analysis (Sternberg,\n1997).\nVarious attempts have been made to achieve some kind of synthesis between the differential and\ncognitive approaches, a call made over 50 years ago by Cronbach (1957). For example, my own triarchic\napproach represents one attempt at such a synthesis (Sternberg, 1985a). But there is no one right\nsynthesis, and in any case, the whole idea of the dialectic is that the synthesis will eventually become a\nnew thesis, itself to be criticized by those who will propose an antithesis, and so on. 124\nThis kind of dialectic is by no means limited to intelligence, cognitive psychology, or even psychology. It\nseems to be an aspect of reality in many and perhaps all fields of endeavor. It means, though, that we\nhave to be careful in viewing our current paradigms or facts accumulated within these paradigms as in\nany sense final. Look at the textbooks of today and of ten, twenty, or thirty years ago, and you will see\nthat general ways of thinking stay the same, but not paradigms and the facts accumulated within them.\nMost of those facts will never be shown to be wrong or other disproved. Rather, they will just come to\nseem uninteresting. The problems of interest to psychologists will change, and with them, the answers.\nTruly, much of life has a dialectical property. At times, we tend to focus on one thing; then we realize we\nwere focusing too much on that thing, so we try to focus on something different. Then we realize we\nneed to integrate the two. For example, we may focus too much on our work at one point, and then\nrebel and focus too much on our personal life. Ultimately, we need to find an integration that\nincorporates both of these foci.\nRelation to the Nature of Intelligence in Everyday Life\nMethods used to study intelligence may seem to involve an issue quite distant from the concerns of\neveryday life. In fact, though, they are not so distant at all. If the assumptions underlying the\npsychometric analysis of intelligence are wrong, then the millions of ability tests given each year under\ndifferent acronyms--for admission to private primary and secondary schools, or to colleges, graduate\nschools, or professional schools, not to mention for placement and diagnosis--are faulty and are possibly\nleading to questionable decisions. Where intelligence is most important is in its interface with everyday\nlife (Sternberg et al., 2000).\nIndeed, there is reason to believe that some of the assumptions underlying our use of tests are wrong.\nThe factor structure of a test may be the same across cultures or subcultures, but it may be that the\nwhole conception of intelligence differs from one culture or subculture to another, so that the test is not\nreally measuring the same thing across cultures. For example, Okagaki and Sternberg (1993) found that\ndifferent ethnic groups have different conceptions of intelligence, and that they socialize their children\naccording to these conceptions. We found, for example, that Latinos tended to emphasize the social-\ncompetence aspect of intelligence more, whereas Anglos tended to emphasize the cognitive-\ncompetence aspect of intelligence more. These conceptions fit the school conception of intelligence to a\ngreater or lesser degree. To the extent the fit is lesser, bright children may appear to be dull to their\nteachers. Even within the mainstream, different occupations have different conceptions of what it\nmeans to be intelligent in their field (Sternberg, 1985b). And in different countries, different views of\nintelligence may predominate (Yang & Sternberg, 1997). Indeed, many languages, such as Chinese or\nHebrew, have no word in the languages that corresponds well to the word intelligence.\nIn sum, what might seem like arcane issues of methodology have a real impact on what happens from\nday to day in children's lives, and what opportunities are given to or taken away from them--on\nwhether, as psychologists, we serve as Jekylls or Hydes. Psychologists and others consequently bear a\nmajor burden in ensuring that the tests of intelligence they are providing adequately represent the\nconstruct they are supposed to be assessing.\nThe Future 125\nThe battles over what intelligence is and what methods should be used to study it represent only two of\nthe many issues that intelligence researchers will have to address during the years of the 21st century.\nSeveral other major issues loom on the horizon, and their answers are potentially high-stakes one. These\nare the issues that are being hotly researched today and are likely to be hotly investigated at least in the\nforeseeable future.\nOne of these major issues is the relation between intelligence, on the one hand, and heredity and\nenvironment, on the other. Although the issue is an old one, new research on it is proceeding at a rapid\nclip, and shows no sign of abating (see Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1997). Most researchers have passed\nthe point where they merely wish to attach percentages to hereditary and environmental contributions\nto intelligence. They realize the important roles of covariance (forces that lead heredity and\nenvironment to have the same effects) and interaction. Various kinds of behavior-genetic designs have\nbeen proposed to tease out the various kinds of effects heredity and environment can have on\nintelligence, but all of them have their own idiosyncratic flaws. Almost certainly, converging operations\nare more informative than are single ones. But we need to remember that, regardless of the\nmethodology used, the conclusion drawn can be as good only as the tests from which one draws those\nconclusions.\nRecent findings are quite intriguing (see Plomin, 1997; Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1997). For example, we\nnow know that heritability of intelligence, at least as measured by conventional tests of\nintelligence, increases with age. Most investigators previously had thought that it would decrease as\nenvironment had more and more of an effect. Instead, it appears that as time goes on, environment\nmatters less and effects of genes matter more. Another interesting effect is that within-family rather\nthan between-family differences appear to matter most for the development of intelligence. In other\nwords, to the extent that differences in environment have an effect on the development of intelligence,\nit appears that the differences that matter most are those in the way different children within a given\nfamily are treated rather than differences in the way children are treated across families.\nSome investigators, such as Plomin (1997), are attempting to go beyond quantitative-genetic studies to\nactual identification of the genes that are responsible for various aspects of intelligent behavior. Plomin\nbelieves that such research may eventually supplant the more conventional statistical studies. Perhaps,\nbut at the moment, such studies yield little more than educated speculations. Links between genes and\nintelligence are so weak that it is unclear how much time it will take before we will be able to establish\nany strong and meaningful links. Certainly, such links would be important to establish, but they have yet\nto be discovered. Studies of the genotype of intelligence have the potential to bring us either into the\nland of Jekyll or that of Hyde. Will we use such knowledge to benefit humankind, or to justify the already\nquestionable treatment of certain groups? Only time will tell.\nA second major issue is group differences in intelligence. Although such differences are widely accepted\nas a fact of life (Sternberg, 1997), they depend on one's accepting the conventional notion of what\nintelligence is. And as the work of Herrnstein and Murray (1994) made clear, perhaps more important\nthan the existence of such differences is their interpretation. The evidence in favor of a genetic\ninterpretation for them is quite weak (Nisbett, 1995), but again, it is difficult to predict what the future\nwill tell. At present, our best guess is that most differences between groups are better attributable to\nsocialization than to genetic effects, or perhaps to covariance and interaction between socialization and\ngenetics. But more research is needed to understand how socialization has its effects. 126\nA third issue that I will mention is the modifiability of intelligence. Some investigators are utterly\nconvinced that intelligence is modifiable (e.g., Feuerstein, 1980; Grotzer & Perkins, 2000; Nickerson,\n1994; Ramey, 1994; Sternberg, 1996), at least in some degree, whereas other investigators are equally\nconvinced that intelligence is minimally or not at all modifiable (e.g., Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Jensen,\n1969, 1998). It may be that we have not gone far in understanding the modifiability of intelligence\nbecause the kinds of tests we use do not give students much of an opportunity to learntthat is, to\nmodify themselvestwhile they are being tested. Alternative testing techniques, called dynamic testing\ntechniques, allow students to learn at the time they are tested (Grigorenko & Sternberg, 1998; Vygotsky,\n1978). In such tests, individuals learn material while they are being tested, and then are tested on how\nmuch they have learned at the time of test. These techniques may give us a better understanding of\npeoples ability to modify their intelligence.\nWhatever the answer, it is important to remember that heritability and modifiability are two completely\nindependent issues. Something can be heritable and either modifiable or not. For example, height is\nhighly heritable, and has also shown substantial modification in recent decades.\nThe distinction between modifiability and heritability, and yet its confusion not only in the mind of the\npublic but even of specialists in the field, is noteworthy. To many people, it simply seems like a matter of\nlogic that if something is inherited, then it is nonmodifiable. These people view genes as opposed to\nenvironment. Yet, this view is wrong. Even IQ, which appears to have a heritability of perhaps .5, has\nbeen shown to be modifiable if only because research shows that scores on tests that give rise to IQs\nhave risen substantially over the past several generations (Flynn, 1987, 1994; Neisser, 1998). There is a\nlesson to be learned, and it is that we often make assumptions not because they are right, but because\nthey are easy to make and sound so darn plausible.\nThe last issue I mention is the one that excites me the most: how to improve achievement in school and\nsociety by taking into account differences not only in amounts of intelligence, but in profiles of\nintelligence. Our research shows that if one teaches in a way that enables students to capitalize on their\npatterns of analytical, creative, and practical abilities, the achievement of the students increases\n(Sternberg, Ferrari, Clinkenbeard, & Grigorenko, 1996; Sternberg, Grigorenko, Ferrari, & Clinkenbeard,\n1999). Moreover, teaching all students in a way that enables them to use their analytical, creative, and\npractical thinking and learning skills appears to result in higher school achievement for all students\n(Sternberg, Torff, & Grigorenko, 1998). It may be possible in the future to help students improve their\nachievement by teaching in ways that expand upon the teaching repertoires that most teachers\ncurrently use.\nJoining In\nThe field of intelligence is one of the most exciting to work in, because the stakes are so high, both\ntheoretically and practically. But it is not a field for just anyone. Precisely because the stakes are so high,\npeople who decide to join the fray need a thicker than average skin. There are so many different points\nof view that it is not a field in which there is any kind of work that is likely to please everyone; unless an\ninvestigator is prepared to take a certain amount of flack, he or she would do better finding another\npursuit.\nWorking meaningfully in the field of intelligence also requires a broader background than might be the\ncase in another field. Work in this field cross-cuts cognitive psychology, biological psychology,\ndevelopmental psychology, differential psychology, educational psychology, personality psychology, 127\ncultural psychology, industrial-organizational psychology, and perhaps other areas of psychology as well.\nTo keep up with the field and advance it, one must be able to understand and to integrate the\ncontributions from these various aspects of the field.\nFinally, I believe that the best work in this field, and perhaps any field, is that done by people who are\nwilling to defy the crowd--to generate their own set of grounded beliefs and to fight for them (Sternberg\n& Lubart, 1995). Students like to believe that science is for the courageous, the willful, the strong of\nmind, and the towering intellect that will fight for truth. None of these stereotypes works awfully well,\nas Kuhn (1970) pointed out some years ago. For the most part, scientists follow the paradigms set by\nothers, accept what they are told, and fill in the small gaps left to be filled by others. The result is that\nmuch and arguably most of the work that is done has little impact on a given field; the field would have\nchanged little if at all had the work never been done.\nWe have no final truth in this or any other area of psychology. At best, we have good theories that will\nlead to new and hopefully better theories. It is the responsibility of the next generation of researchers to\ntake up the dialectic where the previous generation left off--to build on these past theories, even if\nbuilding on them means attacking them in the process. Perhaps curiously, even work that forms an\nantithesis to an existing thesis builds on the past work, because without the thesis, the antithesis could\nnot exist--there would be nothing to attack. We need to encourage students to be scientific but bold,\ninnovative but responsible--in other words, to show in their work the kinds of broader attributes of the\nintelligent people that the researchers themselves study.\nMost of all, researchers in this field need to remember the Jekyll and Hyde character of work in their\nfield. Work in the field of intelligence can do enormous good in providing opportunities for those who\nwould not otherwise have them, or enormous harm in stealing opportunities from those who truly\ndeserve them. Researchers need to think not only about the scientific contribution they have to make,\nbut the contribution to science and society that they leave behind them.\nReferences\nAnderson, J. R. (1983).

Branscombe, University of Kansas and\nRussell Spears, University of Amsterdam\nSocial psychology has always been driven, to some extent, by the prevailing concerns of the day. Even\nwhen not explicitly directed by funding agencies and policy makers, social psychologists have drawn\ntheir impetus for research from newsworthy social phenomena, such as racism, altruism, and the AIDS\ncrisis. This approach has not only led to a proliferation of applied research implementing established\ntheory in a range of assessment and intervention programs, but it has also led to further theoretical\ndevelopments. Some of the earliest advances in social psychology on topics, such as group dynamics and\nsocial influence, were supported by government funds, around the time of the World War II. Very\npractical issues, such as how to maintain group morale among the troops (Stouffer, Suchman, DeVinney,\nStar, & Williams, 1949) and how to persuade homemakers to serve cheaper cuts of meat (Hovland,\nJanis, & Kelley, 1953), reflected the social concerns of that period.\nA balance between the basic and applied wings of the field will need to be maintained if social\npsychology is to remain healthy, and ongoing changes in society, such as increasing cultural diversity, are\nlikely to influence the direction of such research. Social psychology offers a staggering array of topics\nthat appeal to both seasoned and beginning researchers.\nOur own research has been especially directed towards understanding the mechanisms underlying, and\npotential means of intervening in, socially relevant intergroup conflict situations. Before addressing\nwhat we see as useful directions for future work on this vexing problem, we briefly consider the present\nsocial context in which social psychology itself is embedded and how that is likely to influence its future\nresearch agenda.\nThe Current Context of Social Psychology\nWe expect that the current trend of funding research that focuses on the pressing issues of the day will\ncontinue. For example, as long as a medical cure for AIDS is far off, the importance of assessing and\nencouraging behavioral solutions to such health problems is likely to remain a research priority (see\nSnyder, 1993). That threats to health invite social psychological intervention is equally evident in other\nareas, such as smoking, drug abuse, and poor dietary habits, cases in which behavioral prevention is\nbetter than a medical cure of the ensuing problems. Therefore, social psychology has an important role\nto play. Societal problems of this sort cost taxpayers billions of dollars every year so investment in\nresearch designed to address their prevention may have far reaching economic as well as social\nconsequences. Social psychology can provide insight into how social influences affect our behavior, and\nhow we might intervene. The potential role of psychological shifts in self-definition and social contextual\nfactors have yet to be fully explored, and we think this is a direction that social psychology should and\nwill move. We predict that some of the most exciting research in these areas is yet come.\nThese examples of various behavioral problems suggest that some of the most serious issues facing\nhumankind are \"human-made.\" Social conflicts that arise from the need to share the planet with people\nof different creeds and colors seem to increase rather than diminish with the development of\n\"civilization.\" Conflicts between and within nations are not just political issues; they invite social\npsychological analyses as a means of contributing to their solution. Social psychology cannot hope to 134\nprovide all the answers to problems that have strong historical and economic roots, but it has a part to\nplay in helping us understand and shape our world, especially where issues of self, identity, and social\ninteraction play a major role. Obviously, the contributions that social psychologists can make in reducing\ntensions between and among groups underscores the value of creative research in this important area.\nSocial psychological research has been traditionally divided into three general topic areas, based on\nwhether the emphasis is on the factors internal to the individual or broader social processes. At the\nmost intrapsychic level, research topics that have been center stage have included self and attribution\nprocesses, impression formation, and attitudes. Research at the interpersonal level has focused on\nattraction and close relationships, prosocial behavior, and aggression. At the intergroup level, research\nhas been aimed at understanding stereotyping and prejudice, social influence processes, and the impact\nof groups on the individual.\nWithin this tripartite taxonomy of social psychological research, specialization is both to be expected\nand functional: the sheer volume of empirical work makes it increasingly difficult to keep up with the\nlatest developments in all parts of the field. This reality encourages young researchers to concentrate\nearly in their careers in a specialized area of social psychology, but not without a cost. Such\nspecialization produces fragmentation in the field; evidence of this can be found in all three areas of\nsocial psychology.\nIf the discipline is to make progress, the principles developed and evidence accumulated in one part of\nthe field should be applicable to and overlap with those investigated in other areas. Because an\nincreasing division into discrete topics thwarts theoretical integration, we consider here only those\nperspectives that have provided a broader view of the field as a whole. \"Grand theories,\" aimed at\nexplaining all of psychology in terms of a few mechanisms (e.g., behaviorism, Freudian theory), have\nbeen out of favor for some time. Mid-range theories that address phenomena within a fairly\ncircumscribed area have been the norm. However, during the past decade, three fairly encompassing\ntheoretical frameworks aimed at integrating a broad selection of social psychological findings have been\ndeveloped. We briefly review these three different perspectives and point out how they differ from each\nother in terms of primary research topics and their level of analysis. Then, in the remainder of the\nchapter, we consider how the most social psychological of these three frameworkstthe social identity\nand self-categorization perspectivetcan be used further to unify the empirical findings obtained in the\nfield as a whole. We close with a discussion of the processes that we see as requiring further research,\nand we consider several specific new topics that are increasingly likely to capture investigators'\nattention in the new millennium.\nUnifying Theoretical Approaches to Social Psychology\nThe View From Below: Cognitive Psychology\nOne approach that is gaining momentum involves an explicit focus on the potential neural mechanisms\nunderlying social behavior. To some extent, this movement towards an increasingly molecular level of\nanalysis reflects a continuation of the borrowing of models and methods from cognitive psychology that\nhas been ongoing for some time. As described by Fiske and Taylor (1991), the core of research in social\ncognition during the past two decades has focused on the mental structures and information processing\nprinciples employed by the individual perceiver engaged in social judgment tasks. Researchers have and\ncontinue to generate an impressive amount of research that describes the structures and\nprocesses underlying the individual's conception of self and others (Higgins & Bargh, 1987; Linville,\n1987; Markus, Smith, & Moreland, 1985; Smith & Branscombe, 1987; Wyer & Srull, 1986). They have 135\nalso explored how people employ heuristics when reasoning about social events (Branscombe & Cohen,\n1990; Fong, Krantz, & Nisbett, 1986; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Schwarz, 1990) as well as how\nbiases in social judgment might arise as a result of cognitive capacity limitations (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990;\nGilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1988; Hamilton & Sherman, 1989). Research stemming from this tradition is\nincreasingly employing connectionist and neural network models in order to develop a \"machine code\"\nfor phenomena, such as impression formation and social stereotyping (see Smith, 1996). We see this\ntendency to conceptualize social judgment in terms of cognitive psychologys most recent \"bottom up\"\nmodel as likely to underestimate the social relational and motivational underpinnings of human\nbehavior.\nWithin the social cognition tradition, researchers have conceptualized emotional and motivational\nfactors primarily as moderators of normal cognitive processes. That is, emotion and motivation have\nbeen conceived of as \"add-on\" factors rather than ones that are integral to all social judgment and\nbehavior. Thus, a variety of investigators have manipulated the mood state of participants by some\nmeans that is irrelevant to the task at hand (Bodenhausen, 1990; Fiedler, 1990; Forgas, 1995) in order to\nassess how social judgment and memory might be affected. For example, after being told that they will\nbe participating in two unrelated studies and that the first study concerns responses to film stimuli,\nrespondents may be shown a comedy, a sad film segment, or a neutral control. Introduced as a separate\nstudy on impression formation, the task involves manipulation of the features of the target persons or\nthe conditions under which the judgments are rendered. This method assesses the role of different\nmood states that may be pre-existing when people are required to make judgments. Within this type of\nparadigm, moods may influence social processes by altering how the initial information about the target\nis encoded and what strategy is used to make the judgment. Thus, emotion is expected to limit the\ncognitive resources available to the individual, resulting in judgments that are more mood-driven and\nless individuated or responsive to variations in the specific target information provided. The mood state\nitself can create inaccuracy in person perception by eliciting heuristic means of assessing the likability of\nthe target persons, with perceivers simply assessing their mood state and using that as a basis for\njudgment (Isen, 1987; Schwarz, 1990; Worth & Mackie, 1987). The relationship of the target persons to\nthe self, or what kind of affect those persons might evoke in the respondent, has not been focused on in\nthis research.\nIn contrast to mood states, motivation has been conceptualized as the means by which the accuracy of\nsocial perception can be enhanced. If motivational factors influence people's willingness to put forth the\nnecessary effort to arrive at a more individuated and less stereotypic impression of others, judgment\naccuracy may increase (Fiske & Pavelchak, 1986; Showers & Cantor, 1985). The underlying assumption is\nthat focusing on how members of groups are similar to each other is easier than focusing on how\nindividuals differ from one another, with perceived similarity among group members being defined as\nthe essence of social stereotyping. From this perspective, perceived similarity among individual group\nmembers is less accurate than perceived differences among members of a group. Social motivations\nmight determine the level of categorization that is employed. For example, whether people are\nperceived as group members rather than as distinctive individuals can influence categorical judgments.\nIn addition, their judgments might occur in ways that are consistent with the perceivers own position\nwithin the social hierarchy. These complications are neglected when motivation and emotion are\nconceptualized primarily as external moderators of basic social cognition processes rather than as\nintegral to human social perception and evaluation.\nThe View From Our Past: Evolutionary Psychology 136\nA second broad unifying direction that has come to the fore over the last decade involves attempts to\nexplain social psychological phenomena in terms of evolutionary principles (Buss, 1995; Simpson &\nKenrick, 1997). Although this approach can be also characterized as borrowed from biology, it has so far\nhad its greatest impact on topics involving the nature of interpersonal relationships. Specifically,\nevolutionary psychologists have focused on gender differences in sexual behavior, helping, and\naggression. Because men and women are assumed to have faced different adaptation problems because\nof their differing reproduction roles, residuals of this evolutionary history can be exhibited in ongoing\nhuman social behavior. Gender differences that have been central to this theoretical perspective and\nthat have been empirically investigated include number of sexual partners (men report more than\nwomen); psychological investment in children (women report more than men); what aspect of infidelity\nis most distressing (women report greater upset about emotional disloyalty and men report greater\nconcern about sexual disloyalty); who is more likely to behave in a physically aggressive fashion (men\nmore so than women): and who is more likely to help and be helped by strangers versus relatives (men\nare more likely to display heroic helping of strangers but women take care of family members especially\nin private settings).\nOf course, because any of these effects could be also explained in terms of gender differences in\nsocialization and adult role requirements, any impact of our evolutionary history should be reflected\nprimarily in cross-cultural constants. Some of the existing research has explored such possibilities. For\nexample, Buss (1995) has argued that gender differences in terms of the attributes sought in sexual\npartners exhibit some cross-cultural generality (men report desiring physically attractive partners as an\nindicator of reproductive capability and women tend to rate variables related to status as especially\ndesirable in mates). Nevertheless, there is more cross-cultural similarity in the attributes overall that are\ndeemed desirable in a partner by both genders than there are differences. Evolutionary explanations\nthat emphasize consistent differences by gender have difficulty with such similarities. These\nexplanations also struggle with behaviors that are flexible in terms of when and how they are expressed\n(i.e., those that show considerable context-dependence). We argue that flexibility and sensitivity to\ncontext are perhaps the most important hallmarks of human social behavior. We also argue that a\ntheory must be capable of accounting for these characteristics in terms of the psychological processes\ninvolved. Evolutionary psychology emphasizes what behaviors are likely to have worked in the context\nof our ancestors, although the actual nature of that context is much debated. As a result of their focus\non the distant past, we are not provided with an explanation of how people adapt to and navigate in the\ncomplex and changing social environments that are found in present-day Western technological\nsocieties.\nA Social Psychological Integrative Perspective\nAs we see it, the primary problem with attempts at grounding social psychology in neural networks or\ngenetic history is that this neglects more \"top down\" influences stemming from the social context itself.\nAs a result, a uniquely social psychological level of analysis located in the \"here and now\" is precluded.\nAlthough both of these borrowed frameworks represent theoretical attempts at ordering the\nproliferation of phenomena and paradigms within social psychology, there may be important limits on\nthe degree to which we can or should rely on other disciplines for explanatory mechanisms. We believe\nthat for a theoretical framework to be maximally useful it should contain uniquely social and\npsychological mechanisms (see Wicklund, 1990, for a discussion of this issue). For social psychology to\nmake a distinctive contribution, it must acknowledge the fundamentally social nature of mental life and\nexplore how psychological mediation occurs within the individual. Therefore, we turn our attention now\nto a social psychological perspective that attempts to integrate research within the three areas of social 137\npsychologytthe intrapsychic, interpersonal, and intergrouptby employing only social psychological\nmechanisms.\nThe theoretical perspective that meets our criteria can be found in an integration of social identity\n(Tajfel & Turner, 1986) and self-categorization theories (Turner, 1987). Together, they represent a\n\"grand\" theory of the interplay of social cognitive and emotional factors in the generation of behavior.\nTajfel (1972, 1981) emphasized the importance of avoiding biological reductionism and strictly\nindividualistic explanations for social psychological processes. He underscored the important role that\nthe historical and social context plays. The social identity tradition offers a level of analysis that takes\ninto account the nature of the social structure as well as how it is internalized by the individual. Because\nthis theoretical tradition forms a guiding framework for our review of the different areas of social\npsychology, we now provide a brief summary of the general principles involved.\nSocial identity is conceptualized as that part of the person's self definition relating to their membership\nof a social group (or groups), along with the value and emotional significance that entails (Tajfel, 1978).\nThe concept of self-categorization is closely related to social identity but broader in so far as it also\ncomprises definitions at more unique levels (e.g., \"personal identity\") and more inclusive levels (e.g.\n\"humankind\"; see Turner, 1987). Social identity and self-categorization theories emphasize the links\namong social contextual factors, how the self is conceptualized, and whether interpersonal or\nintergroup behavior will be expressed. It does not assume that one level of categorization is more\naccurate, genuine, or real than another. For example, when interacting with a group of friends in one\ncontext, an individual may behave on the basis of his or her individual identity and perceive the self as\ndifferent from the others present. At another point in time, the persons social identity may determine\nwhat actions are undertaken (e.g., as fans of a football team). In that case, even when in the company of\nthe same group of friends at a football game, the individual may feel similar to those same people and\ntypical of \"our team.\" Therefore, all of these processes--perception, evaluation, and action--are solidly\nrooted in the contextually dependent process of self-definition. From this perspective, decontexualizing\nan individual will not reveal his or her \"true\" essence; rather, depending on the context, the person\nis actually an individual who is different from others and a group member who shares attributes with\nothers.\nSocial identity theory tries to explain social behavior in terms of the processes of social categorization,\nsocial comparison, and social identification. Behavior can be explained as a function of the level at which\nthey categorize themselves in any given context. The type of self-categorization operating in a given\ncontext will influence the nature of the comparisons drawn and the emotional significance of others'\nactions. The degree of emotional significance associated with particular identities will influence\nresponses to others who may be perceived as threatening or supportive of one's social identity. One\nbasic assumption of social identity theory is that people try to maintain a positive sense of themselves as\nindividuals. This objective can be accomplished, theoretically, by either personally differentiating the self\nfrom other ingroup members at the individual level, or at the group level by positively differentiating the\ningroup from other groups. Self-categorization theory (Turner, 1987) extends social identity theory to\ncreate a more encompassing perspective on social processes. In self-categorization theory, the self\ndefinition controlling behavior at different levels of inclusiveness (\"me\" versus \"we\") depends on the\nsocial context and the salience of different types of comparisons in the environment.\nThe importance of self-definition and subsequent comparisons drawn as a result were illustrated in a\nrecent study majors (Spears, Doosje, & Ellemers, 1997). Psychology students characterized their ingroup\nas more intelligent when they compared themselves to fine arts students, but preferred to think of\nthemselves in terms of their creativity when comparing themselves with physics. This example makes 138\nclear how the definition of self and its attributes is sensitive to the comparative context and the general\ntendency to view the self positively whenever possible. Our example is also consistent with the\noperation of some basic human \"needs\" that have been the focus of much social psychological\ntheorizing of late. These include especially the need to be positively evaluated and the need for\nattachment or alignment with others (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Branscombe & Ellemers, 1998; Doosje\n& Ellemers, 1997; Sedikides, 1993).\nThe social identity/self-categorization tradition provides us with a relatively simple but powerful\ntheoretical framework for integrating and explaining a variety of social psychological phenomena across\nthe three areas of research. Together they provide a non-reductionistic explanation of intrapsychic\nprocesses, interpersonal behavior, and intergroup relations and a theoretical means of integrating this\ntripartite division. Specifically, self-categorization theory has been used to explain social phenomena,\nsuch as self-esteem maintenance, attitude processes, group formation and cohesion, social influence,\ncrowd behavior, and social stereotyping. To the extent that behavior is rooted in the perceivers\ndefinition of self, and self-definition is defined in relation to others in the context, we have a truly social\npsychological way of analyzing social behavior according to general principles that acknowledge diversity\nof behavioral outcomes across both time and persons. Employment of the central principles in this\ntheoretical tradition allows us to integrate a whole host of empirical findings. We now examine a\nselection of research findings across all three areas of social psychology and illustrate their\nfundamentally social nature.\nImpact of Self-Categorization and Social Context on Intrapsychic Processes\nThe social cognition approach has tended to explain social psychological phenomena in information\nprocessing terms. When making social judgments, people tend to use simplifying but potentially\ninaccurate strategies predominantly over systematically processing the information. From this\nperspective, the social dimension of social cognition simply refers to the fact that we process\ninformation about persons rather than implicate any distinctively social influence processes or\nexplanatory principles. Accordingly, intergroup phenomena, such as stereotyping, have been seen as\nresulting from \"normal\" information processing biases (Hamilton, 1981). Researchers have\nconceptualized attitudes more generally in terms of the underlying information- processing mechanisms\nemployed and the type of cognitive structures activated by a task. The main thrust of traditional models\nof attitudes (e.g., Eagly & Chaiken, 1995; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) has been aimed at determining the\nconditions under which people will select one information processing route or another: focus on the\n\"central\" characteristics of the persuasive message (e.g., argument strength) or \"peripheral\" cues (e.g.,\nnature of the source). However, recent research has begun to question the evidence for attitude\nstructural stability and to consider seriously the possibility that attitudes are actually on-line judgments\nthat are constructed differentially as a function of the context (Millar & Tesser, 1992; Schwarz &\nSudman, 1996; Wilson & Hodges, 1992).\nThe tendency to focus on intrapsychic processes has begun to give way to an examination of more\ncommunicative and contextual factors implicated in attitude change. For example, researchers have\nstarted to examine how impression management concerns can influence message elaboration (e.g.,\nChen, Shechter, & Chaiken, 1996). The expectation of having to persuade a target on the attitude topic\ncan influence how the contents of the message itself are processed (Nienhuis, 1998). Indeed, one\nimportant contextual influence on attitudes involves who the target audience is believed to be. Other\npeople provide a reference point for social comparison and self-definition, and an audience's\nsensibilities has to be taken into account (Leary & Kowalski, 1992; Noel, Wann, & Branscombe, 1995;\nReicher, Spears, & Postmes, 1995). Audiences can both constrain attitude expression and influence how 139\nthey are constructed initially, especially when the audience is perceived as having the power to judge or\naffect the outcomes that will be received. For example, when people are motivated to make a good\nimpression on others who have power over them, they are likely to express attitudes that they believe\nwill positively impress their audience, even if that means derogating an outgroup that is not privately\nperceived as negative. If, however, participants believe that those in power will not learn what attitudes\nthey expressed, then a quite different set of beliefs are reported (Noel et al., 1995). From a self-\ncategorization perspective, both the nature of the self being presented (e.g., personal self versus a\nparticular social identity), and the nature of the audience (e.g., an ingroup or outgroup) can be powerful\ninfluences on behavior. Research that fails to consider the purposes individuals may have in\ncommunicating a message in a given context will fail to anticipate how variable behavior can be in\ndifferent contexts, or appreciate when such behavior will or will not reflect underlying attitudes and\nallegiances (Reicher et al., 1995; Turner, 1991).\nSimilarly, other basic cognitive processes thought to reflect purely information processing concerns\nappear to vary depending on how the self is contextually defined. For example, one influential tradition\nhas concerned people's employment of heuristics--simplifying methods of dealing with complex\ninformation processing tasks (Kahneman et al., 1982). In the initial demonstration of the operation of\nthe availability heuristic, fresher access to instances from memory is used to make a likelihood\njudgment. For example, Tversky and Kahneman (1973) showed that after reading a newspaper article\nabout a car crash, participants were more likely to judge the frequency of motor vehicle accidents. They\nalso judged their own chances of befalling one as higher than in a control condition where a neutral text\nwas read. In other words, reading about this accident made available in memory instances of such\nevents that influenced subsequent judgments of their likelihood. In a replication of this research, Stapel,\nReicher, and Spears (1994) presented physics students with information about a car crash, but they also\nvaried the link between that information and the participants' own social identities. For half the\nparticipants their identity as \"physicist\" was made salient, whereas for the other half the more inclusive\nidentity as \"scientist\" was made salient. As a result, how the participants categorized the self varied\ndiffered across conditions with the relevance of the available or primed information. Thus, when their\nscientist identity was made salient, this includes not only physicists but also psychologists. Only when\nthe reported crash was relevant to an ingroup identity (e.g., when the victims were either physicists or\npsychologists and the salient identity of the participants was as scientists) did respondents display an\navailability bias and overestimate the likelihood of crashes. When the crash story victims were defined\nas outgroup members (e.g., the victims were psychologists and the salient identity of the participants\nwas as physicists), then subsequent likelihood judgments were unaffected. In other words, the\noperation of this seemingly basic cognitive bias stemming from use of the availability heuristic was\ndependent on the social relation of the relevant stimulus to the self.\nThe focus on cognitive processing mechanisms has also resulted in a neglect of the role of the\ncommunicative context. However, on further analysis, judgments that were once thought to be the due\nto the operation of heuristics appear to be products of how people interpret information in various\nsocial communication settings (e.g., Berndsen, Spears, McGarty, & van der Pligt, 1998; Bless, Strack, &\nSchwarz, 1993; Branscombe, N'gbala, Kobrynowicz, & Wann, 1997; Hilton & Slugoski, 1997; McGarty &\nde la Haye, 1997; Stapel, Reicher & Spears, 1995). Thus, what was once thought to be due to the\noperation of fundamental and unchanging cognitive processes, now appear to be the result of\nparticipants attempting to derive social meaning from the materials they are presented with. Recent\nresearch re-examining Kahneman and Tversky's (1982) classic demonstration of the simulation heuristic,\nwhere ease of imagining a better outcome for an event determines judgments about it, makes this\npoint. In that work, the identical poor outcomes obtained by two individuals--one who puts forth effort 140\nin an attempt to make money and one who does nothing--are described in a single scenario to the\nparticipants. Consistently, the judge evaluates the acting target more negatively than the target person\nwho did not do anything. This effect has been assumed to be due to the relatively greater ease of\nmentally simulating the acting target so that a better outcome could be imagined for him than for the\nnon-acting target. Using Kahneman and Tversky's (1982) original materials, N'gbala and Branscombe\n(1997) showed, however, that differential ability to simulate the two targets was not why the targets\nwere judged differently. Indeed, the two targets were actually equally likely to be mentally simulated.\nRather, this judgment \"bias\" was found to arise out of participants' attempts to understand the situation\nthey were presented with (i.e., two targets individuals who received the same outcome, regardless of\ntheir behavior). In order to make sense of the situation, participants directly compared the content of\nthe two targets' behaviors. Given that the poor outcome appeared to be inevitable, participants appear\nto have concluded that the target who invested energy in what was clearly a losing proposition was a\npoorer decision-maker than the one who did not invest any energy. Again, the meaning gained and\njudgment arrived at by these participants in the experimental context they found themselves in did not\nstem from use of a general heuristic such as simulation; instead it resulted from a fairly simple context-\ndriven comparison of the two targets behaviors.\nRecent research using the Ebbinghaus optical illusion has demonstrated how seemingly simple\nperceptual phenomena, such as object size estimation, can be mediated by social meaning (Stapel &\nKoomen, 1997). In this classic illusion, a moderate-sized circle surrounded by smaller circles appears to\nbe larger than a comparable moderate-sized circle surrounded by larger circles. This effect has been\nthought to arise from basic perceptual contrast processes where the context of the surrounding circles\ninfluences the subjectively perceived size of the central circle. Building on earlier research showing that\nthe standard effect can be obtained with social stimuli (faces) as well as circles, Stapel and Koomen\n(1997) showed that the effect only occurred if the face stimuli were defined as emanating from a\ncommon social category (e.g., lawyers). When this common category relationship was absent (e.g., the\nidentical stimuli were said to come from multiple social categories), the size-contrast illusion\ndisappeared. In other words, the socially defined relationship of the stimuli to each other facilitated the\nostensible \"perceptual illusion;\" eliminating that social relationship eliminated the illusion as well.\nIn sum, the assumption underlying much work on heuristics and social judgment is that their use reflects\nbasic cognitive information processing mechanisms. At first sight, their operation would seem to be\nindependent of more obviously social psychological issues of self-definition. However, as we have\nshown, the social context and the perceivers self definition affect even these }basic processes.\" When\nwe turn to more obviously socially influenced judgment processes, such as attributions, the influence of\nculture and motivation are even more apparent. Indeed, a variety of findings that have been assumed to\nbe universal cannot be generalized to more collectivist cultures which tend to be characterized by\ndifferent forms of self-definition and social organization (Markus & Kityama, 1991).\nOne classic example of a phenomenons failure to generalize to collectivist cultures is the case of the\n\"fundamental attribution error,\" in which people over-attribute the causes of actors' behavior to their\ninternal dispositions compared to plausible situational causes or constraints (Ross, 1977). Although\nrobust and widely replicated in Western cultures (Gilbert & Malone, 1995), this finding of greater\npersonal than situational attributions does not extend to participants in the collectivist culture of India\n(Miller, 1984). Because people in individualistic cultures are more likely to see others as masters of their\nown destinies (potentially more than is warranted), they tend to neglect the power of the situation\nwhen making attributions for behavior. Moreover, the contents of a given culture are themselves not\nfixed or constant, but are historically specific (Gergen, 1973; Tajfel 1972; 1981). What it means to be a\nself, at both the personal and social identity levels, can shift over time. As a result, expectations and 141\nbeliefs about how social relations are and should be structured must be historically situated. Because\nthe treatment that is expected and is seen as legitimate for the self when categorized at the individual\nlevel and the self when categorized as a group member can differ, affective responses to the same\nevents can be expected to vary depending on the social context.\nThe tendency to attribute positive or beneficial outcomes to some aspect of the self, and the\nconsequences of doing so, depends on the meaning implied and the aspect of the self that is salient in a\nparticular context. To illustrate, Branscombe (1998) asked male and female participants to think about\neither the positive or negative outcomes that they have received based on their gender group\nmembership. Drawing on the basic social identity theory assumption that people attempt to maintain a\npositive view of themselves, men and women should be differentially motivated to conceptualize the\neffects of their group membership in particular ways. Those persons who are members of a powerful\nsocial group should be reluctant to, and are likely to find it psychologically uncomfortable to, think\nabout themselves in terms of the benefits or privileges received as a function of that group membership,\nespecially in individualistic cultures. In contrast, powerful group members should find it rewarding to\nthink about the disadvantages that are associated with this group identity, especially if they are\nrelatively localized. The results revealed that men did suffer self-esteem loss following thoughts of\ngroup-based privilege compared to thoughts of disadvantage. Thinking about privileges or\ndisadvantages stemming from a subordinate group identity should have quite different effects, with\nthoughts of disadvantage tending to harm well-being in women compared to men. Focusing on group-\nbased disadvantage in women reduces attributions of personal control and is correlated with depression\n(see also Kobrynowicz & Branscombe, 1997; Ruggiero & Taylor, 1997). However, among dominant group\nmembers, well-being reductions were associated with conceptualizing the self as a group member\nwhich, rather than the personal self, was implied to be the critical variable responsible for ones\nsuccesses. As a result, for men, internal attributions for success appear to be undermined by thoughts\nabout the privileges received based on group membership. In fact, for those who are low in\nidentification with their gender group, thoughts that imply illegitimate receipt of benefits based on ones\ngroup membership may result in the experience of group-based guilt. Thus, this research points out how\nthe effects of categorizing one's self in terms of gender depends on the nature of the power relations\nthat exist between the groups and how those are framed in a given context.\nIndeed, how people react to categorizing the self as a group member can depend on the nature of the\ngroup's history. Differential emotional reactions to an event may occur, depending on how the self is\ncategorized and the degree of identification with the group. That is, although intense emotional\nresponses to an event would not be expected when the self is categorized as a unique individual,\nelevated emotional responses to the same event may be exhibited when the self is categorized as a\ngroup member. Doosje, Branscombe, Spears and Manstead (1998) tested this hypothesis by inducing\nparticipants to categorize themselves as members of a group that had historically exploited another\ngroup or that had a history of fair treatment toward the other group. Participants also received feedback\nabout whether they personally had or had not displayed prejudice towards members of the other group.\nEven when participants had nothing to feel guilty about at the personal level, because they believed\nthey had not personally behaved in a prejudicial fashion, knowing their group's history was exploitive,\nresulted in the induction of feelings of collective guilt. In a second experiment using participants' Dutch\nnational identity, Doosje et al. (1998) showed that the degree of collective guilt experienced mediated\nthe impact of ambiguously presented information about their nation's history on behaviors reflecting a\nwillingness to make reparations to members of their nation's former colony (Indonesia). These results\nshow that people may experience emotional responses, such as guilt, but whether this reaction occurs\nor not depends on how the self is defined in a particular context. Furthermore, different kinds of 142\nemotional experiences can result, depending on whether the self is construed at the personal or the\nsocial identity level.\nAs our review has suggested, the social context and how the self is defined are important determinants\nof various social judgments and behaviors that are often assumed to be solely a function of information\nprocessing mechanisms. The social level influences on cognition that we have described appear to be\nconsiderable. Indeed, they may be even greater than those stemming from the impact of human\ncognitive capacity limitations per se. Social cognition seems to be structured by the definition of the self\nthat is employed, with the context enabling socially meaningful perception rather than simply limiting\ninformation processing. As a result, intrapsychic processes can only be artificially separated from the\nother two areas of social psychology, the interpersonal and the intergroup. We now turn to the role of\nself-definitional and contextual factors in interpersonal processes.\nInterpersonal Processes and the Impact of Differing Self-Definitions\nAttraction between individuals has long been assumed to vary as a function of perceived personal\nsimilarity (Byrne, Clore, & Smeaton, 1986; Griffin & Sparks, 1990), familiarity (Bornstein, Leone, &\nGalley, 1987; Moreland & Beach, 1992), and physical attractiveness (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1986). We\nmaintain close relationships when they are perceived to be equitable, instrumentally rewarding, and\nemotionally satisfying (Hatfield, Traupmann, Sprecher, Utne, & Hay, 1985). These same factors\nencourage helping others: attributions of deservingness, ability to obtain a variety of rewards (Piliavin,\nDovidio, Gaertner, & Clark, 1981), and identification with or empathy for the person in need (Batson,\n1987; Smith & Henry, 1996). For the most part, the lack of these factors or the presence of their\nopposites has been shown to influence the expression of aggression. Specifically, frustration, anger,\nperceived unfairness, and an inferred intention to bring about an undesirable outcome have all been\nlinked with aggression (Geen, 1990).\nOnce again, we will not attempt to review all of the research available on interpersonal processes\nexhaustively. Rather, we will show how some of the themes from social identity and self-categorization\ncan be used to illuminate the underlying processes responsible for some of the major effects that have\nbeen observed. Much of the existing social psychological research on interpersonal relations has been\nrather individualistic in the sense that it conceptualizes social interaction exclusively in terms of what\noccurs between individuals when they categorize themselves strictly in terms of their individual identity.\nWe will attempt to illustrate, however, that the self-definition of the participant in a given context (e.g.,\nthe personal versus social level) can moderate interpersonal process effects.\nResearch on attraction has primarily emphasized the bonds between individuals that result from factors,\nsuch as interpersonal similarity, mutual interdependence, and the like. Yet, from a self-categorization\nperspective, attraction to others can also occur at the social level. Furthermore, such social attraction is\nboth conceptually and phenomenologically distinct from interpersonal attraction or the attraction\nbetween individuals as individuals (Turner, 1987). Perhaps the most obvious example of this distinction\ncomes from research employing \"the minimal group paradigm,\" where people reward ingroup members\nand discriminate against outgroup members without any personal knowledge of or relationship with the\nindividuals in either group except for group membership per se (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). In fact, in many\nminimal group studies, the participants' personal friends may be actually categorized as members of the\noutgroup. Hoggs (1992) research has explicitly examined the distinction between personal and social\nattraction and their differing consequences. In that research, participants were first categorized into\ngroups with others who, based on bogus pre-testing, were said to dislike some members of their\ningroup and prefer individual outgroup members. In other words, group bonds per se were not strong in 143\nthis condition and evaluation was made on the basis of each individuals personal features. Measures of\nliking of one form (interpersonal) reflected the features of the individual personalities involved, but\nfavoritism in terms of reward allocations was based on another form of liking (social attraction). As a\nresult, ingroup members who were seen as }interpersonally dislikable\" because of their personal\ncharacteristics were given greater rewards than were \"interpersonally likable outgroup members\" when\nparticipants were acting on the basis of their social identity. Thus, feelings about and the treatment\ndelivered to others depends on how the self and the target are defined: as individuals or as ingroup and\noutgroup members.\nIn a field study of netball players, Hogg and Hains (1997) provided evidence concerning the relative\nindependence of these two forms of attraction. They showed that social attraction (which was related to\nhow prototypical of the group the individual felt and degree of identification with the group) was\ndistinct from personal attraction (which was related to perceived similarity and other interpersonal\nvariables). Indeed we would argue that, in some circumstances, social attraction even may outweigh the\nimpact of interpersonal similarity in evaluation of others. For example, Schmitt and Branscombe (1998)\nfound that men who valued their gender group identity evaluated another man more positively when he\nmatched the group's prototype compared to when he was like themselves personally and was not\nprototypical of the group. Specifically, men who identified highly with their gender group and whose\nmasculinity was threatened by the experimenter telling them that they were less masculine than the\nnorm of their group, actually derogated someone else who was like themselves and was described as\nlow in masculinity. In contrast, when the target was described as highly masculine (and was therefore\npersonally dissimilar to the participant) but matched the prototype of the group, evaluations were more\npositive among the high identifiers. Attraction here was driven more by group level protection concerns\nrather than by interpersonal similarity, which has been heretofore regarded as the main basis of\nattraction.\nLikewise, how people occupying leadership roles are evaluated can depend on how the perceiver\ndefines the self in a given social context. In a series of studies, Platow, Hoar, Reid, Harley and Morrison\n(1997) showed that in interpersonal contexts people have a preference for fair leaders rather than\nunfair leaders, as one might expect. However, in intergroup contexts people exhibit a preference for\nleaders who are unfair (i.e., who are biased against the outgroup). Indeed, leadership endorsement and\nsocial influence in both contexts was mediated by the participants level of self-categorization and the\nextent to which they perceived themselves as members of that group. Such a divergent pattern of\nfindings depending on the judgmental context, reflects the fact that those contexts cue different levels\nof identity (personal versus group), which evoke their own norms and agendas. In an interpersonal\ncontext we are keen to know whether a leader will treat everyone equally and fairly (particularly\nourselves). In an intergroup context, however, the person who best supports our own group's interests\n(against those of the outgroup) may be the one who is seen as best for the group (and oneself). In short,\nevaluation of leaders, and attraction more generally, is not governed by a fixed set of rules. Who we\nevaluate positively or negatively depends on the social context the judgment takes place in as well as\nthe identities that these contexts make salient.\nThe notion that attraction can be socially structured by our group memberships also helps explain some\nimportant aspects of helping behavior. There has been a long-standing debate in this literature as to\nwhether \"true\" altruism exists, or whether the effects that have been obtained can be explained by\nmore self-interested motives. Evidence in favor of altruism has been based on a set of studies illustrating\nthe role of empathy or identification with the person in need. Empathizing with the plight of the person\nin need, according to Batson (1987), evokes a need to benefit the other rather than helping merely as a\nmeans of eliminating ones personal distress in the situation. This research closely parallels the self- 144\ncategorization notion that only when the other is in some sense categorized as part of an inclusive self-\ncategory (e.g., an ingroup) is that person likely to be the beneficiary of helping that is altruistic. Indeed,\nwe would expect that those who are highly identified with a particular group would be more likely to\nempathize with the plight of another ingroup member or the group as a whole and as a result they\nshould be the most prepared to lend assistance. In our own research (Branscombe, Spears, Ellemers, &\nDoosje, 1998) we have found that people who feel highly respected by other ingroup members (e.g.,\nthey believe the ingroup values them as good group members), choose to invest more of their time\nhelping the group compared to themselves personally. We found that this effect was most prominent\nwhen the group itself was a socially devalued one, where the perceived need of the group for the valued\nmember's assistance is especially likely to be high.\nAs with helping behavior, anger and aggression can depend on how the self and the other are\ncategorized. As Smith (1994) discussed in his critique of the hostility and prejudice literatures, responses\nto members of devalued social categories are not uniformly negative. In fact, people frequently exhibit\ndistinctly positive responses to outgroup members who stay within circumscribed social roles,\nparticularly when the relationship is defined as interpersonal (see Eagly & Mladinic, 1994; Jackman,\n1994). Considerable evidence now exists that women, when categorized by men at the interpersonal\nlevel can be very positively evaluated, but when categorized as a member of a competing outgroup they\ncan be treated quite negatively. Similarly, White Americans can express fondness towards Black\nAmericans who occupy domestic or subordinate roles, while at the same time displaying hostility\ntowards those individuals who seek equality for their group. In both of these cases, hostility emerges\nonly at the intergroup level of categorization and when expectancies at that level are violated.\nCategorization at the interpersonal level in both instances can result in positive evaluations.\nConversely, hostility can be experienced when an individual is categorized at the personal level (e.g., as\na function of the individual's dislikable personal attributes). Yet, when the same individual is categorized\nas a fellow ingroup member, positive evaluations can emerge. Wann and Branscombe (1993)\ndemonstrated that evaluation of an attribute or behavior must be considered in context, according to\nthe interpretation it evokes. An aggressive behavior on the part of a person categorized as a member of\none's ingroup (e.g., another University of Kansas basketball fan) was rated positively. The same behavior\nwas displayed by a person categorized as a member of an important competing outgroup (e.g., a\nUniversity of Missouri team fan) and was evaluated negatively. Thus, shifts in the level of self- and\nother-categorization can rapidly alter whether aggression occurs as well its intensity. Hostile responses\ncan be based on either an interpersonal or an intergroup categorization of the target.\nContextual and Self-Definitional Processes in Intergroup Relations\nThe domain of intergroup relations has long been concerned with explaining the all too frequent\nevidence of intergroup conflict. Early approaches to understanding prejudice tended to be quite\nindividualistic, such as the analysis provided by authoritarian personality researchers (Adorno, Frenkel-\nBrunswik, Levinson, & Sanford, 1950). As others have noted (see Billig, 1976), personality-based\nexplanations are ill-equipped for explaining the collective dynamics of intergroup conflict. Indeed,\nPettigrew (1958) argued that prejudice was more strongly related to the content of social norms than to\nindividual psychodynamics. More recently, Altemeyer (1987) has reformulated the original analysis of\nauthoritarianism in largely normative terms.\nThe arrival of the cognitive revolution in social psychology meant, however, that such early attempts to\nexplain prejudice and stereotyping in motivational and normative terms were superseded by accounts\nthat emphasized their emergence as products of everyday information processing biases (Hamilton, 145\n1981). Stereotypes came to be conceptualized as schemas or acquired sets of beliefs about social groups\nthat are stored in an associative memory network (Stangor & Lange, 1994). Like attitudes, they were\nseen as being fairly fixed mental structures that were resistant to change and that should be relatively\nimmune to contextual factors. Hence, much research energy was invested in describing the content of\nvarious prominent social stereotypes (Brigham, 1971; Deaux & Lewis, 1984), as well as in whom and\nwhen they are likely to be activated in memory (Devine, 1989). Even when prejudice was considered to\nbe a genuine reflection of socialization in a prejudiced cultural milieu, rather than being due to\ninformation processing factors alone, it was regarded as something that we all acquire more or less\nautomatically (Devine, 1989). The view that people are automatically prejudiced, and only override this\nprejudice by conscious resistance has been recently challenged. In fact, evidence suggests that prejudice\nitself is not universal and that there are important individual differences (Lepore & Brown, 1997;\nWittenbrink, Judd, & Park, 1997). Not only do our identities make a difference to the expression of\nprejudice, but the observed variability in stereotyping and prejudice means that these phenomena\ncannot be solely located in cognitive processing universals. Social contextual factors can have an impact\non the very meaning assigned to an event and its participants, thereby influencing social behavior.\nThe metaphor of the \"cognitive miser\" that has dominated social cognition research in the last two\ndecades was well placed to provide a powerful explanation of social stereotyping. The use of social\ncategories and the stereotypes associated with them were assumed to be a \"default setting\" in social\nperception. Therefore, their greatest impact should be observable when people do not have sufficient\ntime or motivation to see people as individuals (Brewer, 1988; Fiske & Taylor, 1991). For this reason,\nstereotypes might even be seen as \"energy saving devices.\" In support of this conception, Macrae,\nMilne, and Bodenhausen (1994) found that the processing of stereotype-congruent information was\nindeed facilitated when the stereotype had been previously primed with an explicit category label.\nMoreover, compared to a control condition where the stereotype was not primed, additional cognitive\nresources were freed up as a result of stereotype use, resulting in enhancement of performance on a\nconcurrent task. Thus, from this perspective, although stereotypes might be viewed as dysfunctional at\none level, because of the biases that result from their employment, at another level they could be seen\nas serving a complexity reduction function that facilitates information processing. Stereotype use,\naccording to this perspective, is therefore both understandable and to some extent inevitable.\nThe view that stereotyping results from the ongoing operation of \"normal\" cognitive processes implies\nthat the social perceptions underlying group behavior should be stable and relatively insensitive to the\nsocial context. However, work within social cognition has begun to question the privileged status of\nsocial categories in information processing, and query whether stereotype influences are necessarily\nautomatic (Bargh, 1994; Gilbert & Hixon, 1991) or if their operation are so different from more\nindividuated levels of processing (Kunda & Thagard, 1996). If the meaning of a behavior shifts with the\nsocial context and the meaning of a behavior depends on how the person exhibiting it is categorized,\nthen failure to consider both of these aspects will result in an inaccurate portrait of stereotyping\nprocesses. Focusing on the architecture and limits of information processing neglects the existing power\nrelations between social groups, which forms an important aspect of the social context, as well as socio-\nmotivational factors that influence how the self is categorized.\nNew evidence is beginning to emerge that suggests stereotypes may not be fixed cognitive structures\n(Oakes, Haslam & Turner, 1994; Spears, Oakes, Ellemers, & Haslam, 1997). Rather their content appears\nto vary as if they are constructed \"on-line\" according to ongoing social needs (see also Kahneman &\nMiller, 1986). For example, Haslam, Turner, Oakes, McGarty, and Hayes (1992) showed that the content\nof a stereotype depends on the comparative frame of reference and the current relations that exist\nbetween social groups. When researchers asked Australian participants to characterize Americans, the 146\ncontent of their descriptions (e.g., whether Americans were said to be aggressive or not) varied\npredictably depending on whether the question was asked before the Gulf War or afterwards. Their\nanswers were also influenced by the inclusion of other countries, which were included in the\ncomparative frame of reference. As the War escalated, Americans were more likely to be stereotyped as\naggressive than they had been previously, and this reaction reflected changes in the relationship\nbetween the participants own nation and the U.S. In addition, when the comparative context drew\nattention to the conflict with Iraq, Americans were perceived more negatively than when the frame of\nreference did not remind participants of the Persian Gulf situation. Such work illustrates that\nstereotypes may be more akin to communicative devices whose operation varies depending on the\nrelationship between the stereotyper and the target rather than on fixed mental structures.\nResearchers have increasingly begun to stress the importance of people's desire to make sense of their\nworld actively rather than simply managing cognitive load as important determinants of stereotyping\n(Spears & Haslam, 1997; Yzerbyt, Rocher, & Schadron, 1997). To examine the potential role of peoples\ndesire to understand information for stereotyping processes, Yzerbyt et al., (1997) replicated Macrae et\nal.'s (1994) basic experiment that we described earlier. However, they also added a condition where the\nperson information that was presented for participants to judge was inconsistent with the stereotype\nprime. In this case, they found that priming a stereotype actually consumed cognitive resources (rather\nthan conserving them) as perceivers tried to make sense of and resolve the inconsistency. In a complex\nsocial world then, stereotype use may require interpretative effort and, as a result, it may be more\ncognitively costly than has been previously supposed. If so, conserving cognitive resources cannot be the\nprimary underlying factor in stereotyping. Based on these data it would appear that either economy or\ninefficiency in information processing can occur as a result of stereotype use, and both appear to be by-\nproducts of meaning-making in a given context (Spears & Haslam, 1997).\nAn important social dimension to stereotyping neglected by an exclusively cognitive focus is the fact that\nstereotypic images are shared and communicated. If stereotypes were not socially shared, they would\nbe of little social consequence. However, as a result of their socially consensual nature, the process by\nwhich they come to be promulgated is of central concern (Tajfel, 1981, 1982). The knowledge that other\ngroup members share one's views may be an important means by which stereotypic views are validated.\nSocial influence processes appear to play a critical role in stereotype acquisition (Hardin & Higgins, 1996;\nHaslam, 1997). Therefore, attachment to a social group and the sharing of the groups perspective may\nbe important inputs in the structuring of social cognition itself. Analysis of social relations operating in a\nparticular context therefore seems to be essential to understanding both the stability and variability of\nintergroup perceptions. This consideration necessitates an examination of the role of self-definition and\nsocial context for intergroup perception.\nIn contrast to the cognitive miser approach to stereotyping, social identity theory provides a socio-\nmotivational explanation of prejudice and discrimination (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). Research that has\ntested the various tenets of social identity theory (see Ellemers, 1993, for a review) has delineated\nimportant variables that moderate people's intergroup responses. Specifically, prejudice is more likely to\nbe exhibited when a salient social identity is threatened by either negative social comparisons or by a\nthreat to group distinctiveness, and by persons who are highly identified with the specific group that is\nthreatened (Branscombe & Wann, 1994; Doosje & Ellemers, 1997). In fact, some degree of group\nidentification is necessary for group-based behavior to occur. Research shows that high identifiers react\nin fundamentally different ways than low identifiers. For example, Wann and Branscombe (1990)\nshowed that fans who identified strongly with their team (the \"die-hard\" fans) were more likely to stick\nwith their team even when it was threatened by defeat or a poor record compared to low identifiers\n(the \"fair-weather\" fans). Furthermore, when an important social identity is threatened, high identifiers 147\nare consistently more likely than low identifiers to see both groups as more homogeneous (Doosje,\nEllemers, & Spears, 1995), perceive themselves as more prototypical of the ingroup (Spears et al., 1997),\nand reject deviant ingroup members (Branscombe, Wann, Noel, & Coleman, 1993). High identifiers are\nthus more likely to embrace their group, particularly when it needs their support, whereas low\nidentifiers adopt a more instrumental and individualistic stance, distancing themselves from the group\nwhen it suits their personal interests or when it might represent a threat to their personal identity. The\ncorrespondence between such cognitive effects as self-stereotyping and perceived group homogeneity\nwhich are used to preserve the ingroups distinctiveness with indicators of group behavior such as\nintergroup reward allocations as we have outlined, once again emphasizes the close link between social\ncognition and intergroup processes. Such cognitive changes facilitate ingroup cohesiveness among those\nwho are highly identified. These changes also encourage the use of group-level strategies, such as\ncollective action, to change the intergroup relational status quo.\nMore often than not, social psychologists have been tempted to reduce other aspects of group behavior\nto individualistic processes that fail to capture the social nature of the phenomenon under study.\nPerhaps the classic case of this involves the explanation of crowd behavior in terms of deindividuation\ntheory (Festinger, Pepitone, & Newcomb, 1952; Zimbardo, 1969; Diener, 1980; Prentice-Dunn & Rogers,\n1989). This theoretical tradition draws directly on the earlier writings of Le Bon (1895/1995) who\ndescribed the individual in the group or crowd as being reduced to an \"inferior form of evolution\" where\nall normative restraints on behavior were stripped away. Although deindividuation theory has been\nrepeatedly reformulated, this basic anti-social view of the individual in the crowd has remained a central\nfeature. According to the most contemporary account, deindividuation is a state of diminished private\nself-awareness coupled with arousal caused by immersion in the group (Prentice-Dunn & Rogers, 1989).\nThis state has been assumed to lead to disinhibited behavior and violations of social norms.\nIn a critique of the deindividuation explanation of crowd behavior, Reicher et al. (1995) provided an\nalternative account based on social identity theory (the social identity model of deindividuation effects\nor the \"SIDE\" model). According to this view, anonymity and immersion in the group do not result in a\nloss of the self (as argued by classical deindividuation theory), but serve to enhance the salience of social\nidentity at the expense of personal identity. As a result of such an identity shift, conformity to group\nnorms is enhanced rather than diminished. However, this approach makes a distinction between\nsensitivity to the local social norms that are active in a given research context and more generic societal\nnorms (which define aggressiveness as generally antisocial). This distinction between what was\nnormatively appropriate in the experimental contexts employed in the original deindividuation research\nand broader social norms was not taken into account.\nConsider the classic deindividuation paradigm, where participants were dressed in hoods to make them\nfeel anonymous. They were then required by the experimenter to administer electric shocks to another\nparticipant who was actually a confederate (Zimbardo, 1969). It was assumed that administering shocks\nis characteristic of aggression and is, therefore, anti-normative. However, this interpretation fails to take\ninto account the meaning from the participants viewpoint, given the contextual demands that required\nthem to administer shocks to another person. Indeed, an equally well-known line of research on\nobedience to authority, where participants were also required to administer shocks to another person,\nhas been used as proof of compliance to an authority figure (Milgram, 1974) and not as evidence of\nsocially unregulated behavior. The local normative demands that were operative in deindividuation\nstudies appear to be rather different than those that might be found in other social contexts. To explore\nthis possibility, in a meta-analysis of the all the relevant deindividuation studies, independent raters\nrated both the local norms governing the experimental setting as well as more general societal norms\nthat might apply (Postmes & Spears, 1998). The evidence obtained overwhelmingly supported the 148\nnormative analysis based on the SIDE model: conformity to the specific social norms operating in prior\ndeindividuation studies best accounted for the outcomes that had been obtained. Thus, people's\ninterpretation of the situation they are faced with is guided by contextually derived social norms.\nGroup norms have been postulated to play an important role in moderating intergroup behavior such as\ningroup favoritism (Turner, 1987). There is a close link between social identification and conformity to\ngroup norms. In a series of studies, Jetten, Spears, and Manstead (1996) manipulated ingroup and\noutgroup norms orthogonally to create a discrimination or fairness norm. Results showed that group\nmembers conformed to the ingroup norm, even when it dictated fairness to the outgroup. This finding\nsuggests that group norms have the power to moderate the extent to which ingroup bias occurs.\nIndeed, people who identified highly with their group were particularly likely to conform to their group's\nnorm, whether it was one of discrimination or fairness (Jetten, Spears, & Manstead, 1997). A major\nquestion that might profitably be pursued in future research is how \"fairness\" social norms can be more\nbroadly created. According to this analysis, such norms may well be critical if we hope to reduce social\ndiscrimination.\nIn existing models of persuasion and attitude change, intrapsychic processes have been emphasized\nmore strongly than has the communicative context. In the dual process models of persuasion that we\ndescribed earlier, the group membership of the source was conceptualized as a peripheral cue that can\nlead to weak and ephemeral social influence. By contrast, cognitive elaboration was expected to operate\non the central arguments of the message. Likewise, classical perspectives on social influence subscribe\nto the view of the group as exerting an external pressure to comply (\"normative influence\"), which does\nnot necessarily lead to internalized or \"true\" influence (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). However, the self-\ncategorization approach to social influence accords the group a more central and influential role\nbecause its norms can be central to how we define ourselves. Therefore, knowing what groups people\nidentify with can help us understand what norms people are likely to have internalized (Turner, 1991). In\nthis sense, the group is not peripheral but is central to our understanding of when and how social groups\nexert an influence on the individual.\nAs our selective summary of research on intergroup relations has illustrated, the operation of the same\nsocial principles can be observed as when interpersonal and intrapsychic processes are examined. Our\noverview emphasized the importance of the social context, how the self is categorized, and the\nimplications for social behavior that follow from conformity to various types of social group norms.\nSocial psychology has become sufficiently mature to generate its own theoretical explanations that are\nuniquely social, and the integrative framework provided by social identity and self-categorization\ntheories offers a useful set of principles for understanding seemingly widely disparate social\nphenomena. Indeed, rather than social psychological phenomena originating in basic cognitive\nprocesses or capacity limitations, the research on intrapsychic processes that we discussed suggests that\nmany apparently basic cognitive and perceptual processes may themselves be socially mediated by level\nof self-definition and social contextual factors. Research in all three of the major research areas of social\npsychology has provided evidence for the operation of these fundamentally social influences. Using the\nprinciples stemming from social identity and self-categorization theories allowed us to survey social\npsychology in a fairly integrated and interrelated fashion, as a distinctive and unitary discipline. Although\nthere have been other candidates for integration and unification, either \"from below\" (neuroscience,\nconnectionism) or from \"our past\" (evolutionary psychology), by their very nature they fail to do full\njustice to the social psychological nature of the phenomena investigated.\nInto the New Millennium 149\nAll three of the different unifying theoretical approaches to social psychology that we discussed\n(connectionism and information processing, evolutionary theory, social identity and self-categorization)\nare likely to receive increasing research attention as we move into the new millennium, in part because\nof their ability to order seemingly disparate findings. As the methods and models within cognitive\npsychology become more sophisticated and plausible neural pathways are developed, some social\npsychologists will increasingly pursue this route. Similarly, although evolutionary approaches to social\npsychology are as yet in their infancy, the indications are that their influence will grow as advocates try\nto push the limits of this level of explanation as far as possible and provide further links to the biological\nsciences. Because we believe that the richness of social behavior is inherently influenced by people's\nsocial identities and the agendas dictated by those groups' norms, we expect that research illustrating\nhow behavior is shaped by a host of economic, cultural, and historical conditions will increase as well.\nSuch effects, as they emerge, are unlikely to be reducible to the micro-mechanisms of the neural\nnetwork or the macro-mechanisms of evolutionary selection pressures.\nThe challenges of social psychology in the new millenium should be especially attractive to scientists\nwho have the capacity to synthesize findings from diverse theoretical approaches. Graduate students\nlooking for an academic home in social psychology will need to be able to use theory in a fluid and\nintegrative manner to bring the best elements of relevant theories to bear on the social puzzles before\nus.\nWe have chosen to focus on one important representative of a social psychological level of analysis, but\nthere are also other equally \"social\" candidates that we have neglected and that may gain in influence in\nthe future. In particular, social psychological approaches, such as the discursive and social\nconstructionist traditions which have hitherto been somewhat separated from mainstream\nexperimental research, should continue to thrive (e.g., Gergen, 1991; Potter & Wetherell, 1987). These\nresearch traditions have diverse roots, notably in ethnomethodology within sociology, and speech act\ntheory and semiotics within linguistics and philosophy. There are also close connections between\nconstructionism and the more \"sociological\" branch of social psychology, the \"symbolic interactionist\"\ntradition. Social constructionistapproaches tend to focus on how social reality is constructed through\nlinguisitic and discourse processes. In its more radical form, this view questions whether there is indeed\na reality \"beyond the text\" or outside of linguistic constructions (postmodernist philosophy has been\nvery influential here). In methodological terms, this tradition has been critical of experimental means of\nimposing a particular construction of reality on participants, and for assuming that it can access some\nunderlying truth beyond the understandings and discourses of the participants involved. In response,\nmainstream social psychologists have criticized those in the social constructionist and discourse camps\nfor the relativism and indeterminacy of its position and for questioning the value of quantitative\nmethods of assessing underlying causal relations (Spears, 1997). These criticisms of the experimental\nmethod have doubtless contributed to their current lack of impact on mainstream social psychological\nresearch.\nThe issue of how meaning is socially constructed has, for the most part, been neglected in mainstream\nsocial psychology and it may well become an important problem around which integrative progress can\noccur. Some attempts are already evident. Research within the social cognition tradition has begun to\nreveal the value of incorporating constructionist principles in ways that use rather than oppose standard\nscientific paradigms. Research on \"construal\" processes (Griffin & Ross, 1991) has shown that the\nobjects of perception and judgment should not be taken as givens. Indeed, the way in which we\nconstrue (or \"construct\") an object, has important consequences for judgment and behavior. For\nexample Asch (1952) showed that interpretation of and agreement with the statement \"a little rebellion\nnow and then is a good thing\" was dramatically affected by whether its source was cited as Thomas 150\nJefferson or V.I. Lenin. Such differential interpretations are socially shared and socially constructed as\nwell as cognitively construed. In this sense, social constructionism has the capacity to add an even more\nsocial dimension to social psychology. Similarly, recent research examining communication principles\nand \"conversational norms\" has highlighted their importance for intrapsychic processes such as\nattribution (Hilton & Slugoski, in press). Thus, many of our existing experimental results may be the\nproduct of how people make sense of the experimental context according to the pragmatic rules of\ncommunication, rather than reflecting the direct and unmediated products of cognition. Sensitivity to\nsuch processes will help us not only better distinguish artifact from reality, but also to understand better\nthe communicative dimensions of social reality.\nIn terms of the social identity and self-categorization traditions that have formed our main thematic\nfocus, there is also scope for integration with a more constructionist perspective. There is a tendency for\nthese theoretical traditions to take the definition of self and social contexts as \"givens\" whereas these\ntoo are to some extent negotiated and contested in social discourse. For example, whether we view a\nrioting crowd as a \"mad mob\" or as a group victimized by police, is a matter of how we construct this\nevent. These differing constructions are influenced by self definition and social context (Reicher, 1995).\nHow we see the event is dependent on whether we define ourselves as peaceful demonstrators who are\nbeing attacked by the police, or as neutral bystanders who are witnessing an intergroup conflict. In fact,\nsuch bystanders may construct the event differently than those who merely read about it in newspapers\nwhich present it through the eyes of journalists who use certain discourses to define the crowd in terms\nakin to those used by Le Bon. In short, there may be multiple possible constructions of the same event,\nwith each capable of influencing our evaluation of it. Greater recognition of the constructed nature of\nsocial categories and situations may provide one of the missing links in self-categorization research in\nparticular, and in mainstream social psychology in general.\nDevelopments That Will Further Link the Three Social Psychological Research Areas\nAs we described already, degree of identification with one's group is an important predictor of group\nbehavior when the relevant identity is salient. We argued that participants in minimal groups studies\nwere attempting to achieve a positively distinct social identity. However, research has increasingly\nbegun to look at the role of intragroup dynamics as contributors to intergroup behavior. Factors that can\nmoderate the occurrence of intergroup behavior include the individual's personal status or ability\n(McFarland & Buehler, 1995; Seta & Seta, 1996), the personal self-esteem level of the individual (Long &\nSpears, 1997), and the degree of perceived respect received from other ingroup members (Smith &\nTyler, 1997; Tyler, Degoey, & Smith, 1996). Research linking intragroup dynamics and intergroup\nbehavior reveals that depending on one's position within a group (be it peripheral or central), behavior\ncan reflect either intragroup concerns or more group-level purposes (Branscombe et al., 1998; Noel et\nal., 1995). An outwardly appearing identical behavior (discrimination against an outgroup) can be either\npersonally instrumental--engaged in as a means of currying favor for the self with other ingroup\nmembers, or it can be enacted in the service of the group's needs out of genuine commitment to the\ngroup and its goals. Although these studies illustrate that intergroup behavior can be quite complex and\ncan derive from intragroup as well as intergroup agendas, additional research examining how contextual\nfactors alter their relative weight is needed.\nWe also perceive a need for additional research linking traditonal intrapsychic topics, such as attribution\nwith interpersonal and intergroup processes. Attribution theory has focused primarily on how\nindividuals themselves, as isolated agents, construct explanations for events. However, others may exert\nimportant influences on the nature of the explanation for an outcome that is ultimately deemed to be\nthe most plausible one. Research concerning normative influences on acceptance of group-based 151\nexplanations for events (i.e., discrimination), and how they come to be socially validated or not, could\ngreatly expand our understanding of the development and promulgation of social ideologies.\nFurthermore, because individuals can and do categorize themselves at different identity levels\ndepending on the nature of the social context, the explanations that they are willing to accept for the\nsame outcome might vary accordingly. Consider the attributional dilemma of a job candidate who\napplies for a position but is not selected. Are there normative supports available for this person to\nconsider the possibility that group-based discrimination may have played a role in producing this\noutcome, or is such an explanation seen as a socially undesirable one to voice? Does the degree of social\ninfluence on such explanatory processes depend on whether an ingroup member or an outgroup\nmember suggests that discrimination may have played a causal role in producing the outcome? Does the\nexplanation that is suggested by others encourage consideration of how \"people like us\" have been\nhistorically treated by \"people like them,\" or does it discourage such possibilities by pointing to more\nindividualistic factors (Smith & Spears, 1996)? Because quite different behaviors may be dictated\ndepending on who suggests what type of explanation best accounts for a given outcome, the potential\nimpact of such normative factors deserves additional research attention in the future.\nApplied or Social Issue Topics That Will be Increasingly Pursued\nOpportunities to contribute in meaningful ways to understanding group phenomena linking these three\napproaches are plentiful. We will suggest many important areas that could serve as dissertation topics\nfor graduate students or the start of important research streams for beginning researchers.\nIn the foregoing sections we have tried to show how intergroup conflict and discrimination are not\nnecessarily inevitable. We believe that appropriate group norms, ideologies, and values may ultimately\nhelp to keep the peace. With the changing structure of the American population in terms of increasing\ncultural diversity and increasingly global interactions, the possibilities for interacting with different sorts\nof people have soared (Gergen, 1991). Such interactions mean that wider and more diverse types of\nsocial contacts and influences can be expected, providing for both the possibility of greater integration\nbased on diversity and acceptance of cultural differences, although it also raises the potential for\nincreased intergroup tension.\nThe social identity tradition in social psychology is one perspective that has encouraged the discipline to\ntake a new look at more macro-level social concerns such as cultural diversity, multiculturalism, and the\nnature of power. Research has already begun to examine how cultural factors can influence social\nperception and behavior. The roles that power and status play via memberships in dominant and\ndevalued social groups is also likely to become an increasingly important research topic (Branscombe &\nEllemers, 1998; Fiske, 1993). We are seeing a new interest in the psychological experience and\nperspective of members of devalued social groups (Crocker & Major, 1989; Steele, 1997) and the\nresponse strategies available to them when they face social discriminatory treatment. Thus, we predict\nthat research will increasingly employ members of devalued groups as participants. The tenability of the\nexisting assumption that all people, regardless of their place in the social structure, respond similarly to\nthe social conditions they find themselves in is beginning to be questioned. To take one recent example,\nBranscombe, Schmitt, and Harvey (in press) distinguished between the psychological responses of\nAfrican-Americans who differ in terms of how pervasive they perceive prejudice to be, and how those\nare likely to differ from dominant group members who perceive themselves to be victims of\ndiscrimination. Historically disenfranchised group members are more likely to perceive the outgroups\ndiscrimination as stable and pervasive, and this perception encourages such persons to turn toward\ntheir minority group as a means of protecting their well-being. Because the US is becoming an\nincreasingly ethnically diverse society, such variations in willingness to define the self in terms of a 152\nminority group membership and the social interactional consequences of that choice should receive\ngreater attention in future research.\nThe face of the population is changing in other important ways that are likely to have consequences for\nsocial psychological research in the future. As a consequence, creative students will have ample\nproblems to study in this area. One demographic change that is likely to exert a widespread social\nimpact concerns the age profile of the population. As a result of increases in life expectancy, an\nincreasing proportion of the population is elderly, with those over 85 being the fastest growing group\n(Hansson, 1989). As the number of older Americans grows, stereotyping and intergroup conflict research\nbased on age groups will also come increasingly to the fore. In fact, the National Science Foundation has\nrecently announced a new grant initiative aimed at integrating existing social psychological research\nwith aging issues. Although age group membership is a particularly interesting example of a group\nconflict situation because it is the only one where we rotate through the different categories (see\nSnyder & Miene, 1994), the possibility of intergenerational conflict is nevertheless quite real. Increased\ndependence by this growing segment of the population on public funds from social security and\nMedicare, combined with political organizations that present the elderly as taking resources from the\nyoung reflects the need for research that can assist in the management of this social change.\nFurthermore, a focus on aging could act as an impetus for work on multiple category memberships. As\nHansson (1989) has noted, the aging experience is fundamentally dependent on other social group\nmemberships. It is primarily White Americans, rather than minority group members, who constitute the\nbulk of the elderly population, especially those who are relatively well-off financially. Likewise, the\nnumber of elderly women is growing at a much faster rate than the number of men. Thus, existing group\nconflicts based on ethnicity and gender may be played out in terms of stereotyping and prejudice\nagainst the elderly. Therefore, solutions will require a more solid understanding of how one kind of\nsocial category membership can influence the ongoing impact of another.\nMore generally, we see an important need for research in the future on the role of multiple group\nmemberships. We currently have only a minimal understanding of what influences when people will\nperceive others in terms of one or another of their group identities, or if the processes differ for\nintersecting category memberships. Furthermore, identities are rarely experienced as a constant across\ntime, and how some come to gain importance while others decrease has received little attention. As\npeople navigate their way through life, they may encounter circumstances in which desirable new\nidentities can be added (Ethier & Deaux, 1990), and the loss of others must be coped with. As\nBreakwell's (1986) pioneering work on people facing unemployment, divorce, and immigration\nillustrates, the psychological impact of such profound identity changes depends on the degree to which\nthey are voluntary or externally imposed. In addition, the degree to which people anticipate being\naccepted into and receiving positive treatment based on their new group membership is likely to be\ncritical for adjustment.\nPerhaps because social psychology has been historically wedded to the undergraduate as research\nparticipant (see Sears, 1987), we have not as yet fully appreciated how group commitments may shift\nacross the lifespan. Addressing additional questions such as why people might choose to exhibit\nnegatively evaluated identities with visible markers (e.g., tattoos, body piercings) deserves attention.\nWhen such markers of group membership will come to be widely accepted throughout the culture and\nwhen they will remain indicators of \"fringe\" status could be used to investigate broader questions\nconcerning the processes of social diffusion and social change. Similarly, gaining an understanding of\nwhat circumstances and why people might attempt to hide their group membership (e.g., homosexuals,\nsigns of aging) will require us to seek research participants outside the academy. As a starting place, we\nsuggest that some people may choose to align themselves with social groups that are negatively 153\nevaluated because they reject the standards of the \"mainstream\" (potentially as a result of feeling\nrejected by it), and they wish to convey that they are not \"one of them.\" Other people may move\ntoward an alternative group identity because they do identify with that group's norms and values, and\nthey wish to publicly express their alignment with it. The possibility that differing social motivations may\nbe crucial for joining different social groups or in different members of the same group cannot be\nassessed without research on actual members of such groups.\nJust as important as the social and demographic changes that are ongoing in society are the\ntechnological changes that accompany them. These changes will provide countless research ideas for\nenterprising students. For example, increasing automation of production and so forth makes possible\nalternative ways of organizing work and leisure, as well as altering the structure of the relations\nbetween people. Perhaps the most significant change in this area in the last 10 years, and one that will\ncontinue to develop, concerns the new communications technologies such as e-mail and widespread\naccess to the internet. Increasing numbers of people are interacting with one another by means of text-\nbased computer-mediated communication and standard on-line video links are not far off. Once again\nsocial psychological research can make a contribution to our understanding of the effects that these\nnew technologies can exert on social interaction and organization.\nThe proliferation of communications media means that we are potentially inundated with information\non a scale not before known, leading to what one author has referred to as the \"saturated self\" (Gergen,\n1991). Many people may experience the infinite choices provided by these media as overwhelming and\nfind the shifting skills required to manage these technologies as psychologically stressful. More\npositively, the range of choices provided by these media, and the Internet in particular, means that\npeople can channel and tailor them to their own work, consumer, and entertainment needs. The day\nwhen the mass media are as varied as the groups and individuals that they address is not too far around\nthe corner. The \"agenda setting\" influence of the mass media may increasingly disappear if individuals\ncan set their own agendas to suit their existing political preferences and tastes. Such flexibility may,\nhowever, come at the cost of social fragmentation if individuals increasingly withdraw from the real\nsocial world into their virtual ones.\nHowever, these virtual worlds do offer new ways of being and relating to others. In cyberspace, there\nare new possibilities afforded for identity construction when freed from the constraints of time,\ndistance, and personal appearance. The Internet provides a new medium for interpersonal contact that\nis no less intimate than face-to-face communication and sometimes is more so (Lea & Spears, 1995).\nIndeed, these new communications media may be experienced by some as personally liberating in so far\nas they allow for increasing control of our information consumption and our interpersonal relations.\nNevertheless, there is also no guarantee that access to these technologies will be equally distributed and\nthat existing power and status gaps may be reproduced in terms of differential access, with the\nopportunities provided by them exacerbating the gap between the haves and the have nots. Moreover,\neven for those persons who do have access, there is some evidence that features of the Internet\n(anonymity and isolation) can paradoxically reinforce social boundaries rather than break them down.\nAlthough some researchers have argued that the relative absence of social cues can undermine status\ndifferences and lead to more equalized and democratic participation (e.g., Kiesler, Siegel, & McGuire,\n1984), this view is not universally shared. Research in the tradition of the social identity model of\ndeindividuation effects that we discussed earlier suggests that such interaction may be more bounded\nby social context and relational factors than previously thought. Thus, according to this model, the visual\nanonymity associated with such media can reinforce the impact of social identities, social norms, and\nthe operation of existing power relations, compared to more face-to-face communication where 154\nindividual differences are more salient (Spears & Lea, 1994). Simply because people interact with each\nother less directly than in face-to-face communication, does not render an analysis in terms of social\npsychological principles any less relevant or applicable.\nAlthough predicting the future of any human endeavor can be a risky business, we have pointed to what\nwe believe will be important directions for social psychological research in the future. By first examining\nimportant existing threads of research, within an integrative framework, we were able to project those\nstrands forward to provide a peek at what the social psychological quilt might look like in the future.\nWhat can be confidently predicted is increasing theoretical integration across the three traditional areas\nof social psychology in terms of common mechanisms and a continuing concern with addressing applied\nsocial problems as they emerge. As such, students capable of sophisticated theory skills will not only\nhave a variety of opportunities from which to choose, but also may be able to make a substantial impact\non the serious social problems that we will face in the next century.\nReferences\nAdorno, T.W., Frenkel-Brunswik, E., Levinson, D.J., & Sanford, R.N.

Durik\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nIntroduction\nPsychology of women has come a long way from Helene Deutsch's (1944) psychoanalytic writing and the\ncentury-long tradition of gender differences research in psychology. Today it has a vibrant foundation of\nthree decades of contemporary research and a promising future built on this foundation, yet with many\nquestions unanswered. Psychology of women today interweaves three strands: (a) psychological\nresearch focused specifically on women, their psychological functioning, and women-associated issues\nsuch as rape; (b) the psychology of gender, incorporating traditional research on gender differences but\nexpanding beyond that to examine gender as a stimulus variable; and (c) feminist psychology, rooted in\nfeminist theory and an articulated set of values that emphasizes equality of opportunity for women. We\nincorporate all three of these strands in our review.\nHere we will consider four major areas that represent the current status of the psychology of women\nand, we believe, will chart the future of psychology of women: theories in the psychology of women; the\nintersection of gender with race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability; research methods in the\npsychology of women; and applications of research on the psychology of women in the areas of public\npolicy, forensic practice, and the practice of psychotherapy and counseling.\nTheories in the Psychology of Women\nFew \"grand theories\" have been proposed in the field of psychology of women; one of the few is gender\nschema theory (Bem, 1981), reviewed below. This is not to say that the field is atheoretical. Rather than\nbuilding grand theories, researchers have concentrated on rewriting and redefining the androcentric\ntheories upon which psychology was established and building models to deal with more circumscribed\nproblems. Feminist theory, often borrowing from the humanities, has been a rich source as well. Here\nwe review each of these approaches, with examples.\nGender Schema Theory\nBem's (1981) gender schema theory reflects the cognitive revolution in psychology over the last several\ndecades and applies this approach to understanding the development of gender stereotyping. In\ncognitive psychology, \"schema\" generally refers to a cognitive structure, developed from prior learning,\nthat is used when filtering and interpreting new information. For Bem, a gender schema is a person's\ngeneral knowledge framework about gender, with which information is processed and organized based\non gender-linked associations. Children gradually form a gender schema as they learn their culture's\nnetwork of associations with gender. Moreover, the gender schema becomes linked to self-concept so\nthat children, as part of their motivation to become \"good\" girls or boys, engage in the gender-\nappropriate behavior specified by the gender schema.\nMany studies support gender schema theory. In testing the theory, Bem categorized participants\ninto gender-schematic persons (masculine males and feminine females, as determined by Bem's test of\nandrogyny [1974]) and gender-aschematic people (androgynous males and androgynous females). She 166\nargued that gender-schematic people are more likely to engage in gender-schematic processing of\ninformation, whereas gender-aschematic people engage in it less. In a free-recall test of a list of words,\ngender-schematic people were more likely to cluster the words by gender (e.g., gorilla, bull, trousers),\nthan gender-aschematic people were. Reaction-time data indicated that gender-schematic people,\nwhen responding \"me\" or \"not me,\" processed schema-consistent attributes faster than they processed\nschema-inconsistent attributes. Martin and Halverson (1983) found that, if five- and six-year-old\nchildren were shown pictures of children engaging in stereotype-consistent or stereotype-inconsistent\nactivities, a week later the children made errors in recall of the stereotype-inconsistent pictures,\nrecalling them as stereotype-consistent. That is, if they had seen a picture of two girls boxing, they\nremembered that they had seen two boys boxing.\nGender schema theory is compelling for a number of reasons, one being that it explains why gender\nstereotypes are so resistant to change -- our gender schema simply filters out stereotype-inconsistent\ninformation. The theory has also been criticized but the reasons are too technical to go into here (e.g.,\nSpence & Helmreich, 1981). From our point of view, the main limitation of the theory is that it is\nexclusively cognitive.\nEmotion is reemerging as a prominent construct within psychology in general, and in the 21st century\nwe look toward theories of gender that integrate cognition (thought) and affect (emotion). For example,\nthe expanding literature on self-concepts and self-strategies (see review by Wood, 1989) is just waiting\nto be incorporated into research on gender. As we noted, gender schema theory provides a cognitive\nexplanation for why gender stereotypes are so difficult to change. However, another plausible, and very\nexciting explanation might suggest that some people are motivated to maintain their gender\nstereotypes. For instance, there may be times when people accentuate or draw attention to their own\ngender-stereotyped traits, if doing so makes them feel good about themselves. People may feel more\npositively about themselves and their own gender when they degrade the other gender.\nOn the other hand, some people do indeed work on reducing their stereotyped attitudes about gender,\nbut what motivates them to work so hard at this? Maybe there are situations in which gender\nstereotypes become so personally limiting and/or defeating that people want to reject them? How do\nthey do this? Integrating self-concept research into research about gender presents the opportunity to\ndetermine motivational factors underlying why gender is such a salient interpersonal characteristic for\nboth women and men, and why its importance is so immutable.\nSpecific Models\nHere we will provide two examples of research building specific theoretical models to deal with specific\nquestions.\nStereotypes and power. Susan Fiske (1993) has proposed a model of the ways in which power and\nstereotypes influence each other. Two processes are involved: (a) Stereotyping exerts control or power\nover people, pressuring them to conform; therefore, stereotyping maintains the status quo. (b) Powerful\npeople tend to stereotype less powerful people far more than the reverse. Given that gender is an\nimportant status or power variable, you can read \"men\" for \"powerful people\" and \"women\" for \"less\npowerful people.\" The theory is even broader than that, though, and extends to other categories such as\nethnic groups.\nLet's consider the first process, in which gender stereotyping exerts control of males and females.\nStereotypes can be prescriptive -- that is, they say how people of a certain group should behave.\nAdolescent boys should excel at athletics. Girls should not be aggressive. If one fails to meet the 167\ndemands of such stereotypes, the penalties can be severe, such as social rejection by the peer group.\nStereotypes, therefore, exert control over people.\nTurning to the second process, the powerful group (men) tends to stereotype the less powerful group\n(women) more than the reverse. Less powerful people generally are motivated to pay attention to the\nidiosyncrasies of powerful people because those powerful people control outcomes for the less\npowerful. Servants know a great many details about their employers and their preferences, for example,\nbut the reverse is unlikely. Powerful people pay less attention to others and consequently rely on simple\nstereotypes. Powerful people pay less attention to the less powerful in part because the less powerful\nhave little control over them.\nFiske (1993) has conducted many clever experiments to test various aspects of her theory. In one study,\nundergraduates were given the power to evaluate the summer job applications of high school students.\nSome undergraduates were given more power in the final decision and others were given less power.\nThe students who were given more power actually paid less attention to the applicants, consistent with\nFiske's model.\nFiske's model and research were influential in an important Supreme Court case, Price Waterhouse v.\nHopkins. Ann Hopkins was denied partnership in the prestigious accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.\nCompared with her male colleagues who were also being considered for partnership, she worked more\nbillable hours, was well liked by clients, and brought in millions of dollars in accounts. She was denied\npartnership not because her performance was inadequate (it was in fact superb by objective standards),\nbut rather because she was not considered feminine. Stereotype violation, in short, was used as grounds\nfor the denial of promotion.\nBased on Fiske's model, we can understand how stereotypes operated at several levels in this case. Men\nwere in power at Price Waterhouse and women were outnumbered. Therefore, the powerful men were\nlikely to hold stereotyped expectations about the women and to pay less attention to their individual\ndetails, such as their qualifications. Hopkins, by being a successful woman in a male-dominated\nprofession was a stereotype violator and received punishment for it.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hopkins, and the brief filed by the American Psychological\nAssociation, reporting Susan Fiske's research, was highly influential in the decision.\nMen who sexually aggress against women. Some theorists argue that too much rape research has\nfocused on women who have been raped, when the real emphasis should be on the aggressors. Only by\ngaining a scientific understanding of them will we be able to reduce the occurrence of rape. Neil\nMalamuth and colleagues (1991) developed a model of the factors that predispose a man to engage in\nsexual coercion with women and then tested it against data obtained from a large, national sample of\nmale college students. According to their model -- and the data supported it -- four factors predispose a\nman to engage in sexual coercion: (a) Hostile home environment -- Violence between parents or\nbattering or sexually abusing the child increase the chances that the boy will engage in sexual coercion.\n(b) Delinquency -- Being involved in delinquency leads a boy to associate with delinquent peers who, for\nexample, encourage hostile attitudes and rationalizations for committing crimes and reward a tough,\naggressive image. (c) Sexual promiscuity -- Often in the context of the delinquent group, the young man\ncomes to believe that sexual conquests bring him status within the peer group, and coercion may seem\nto be a reasonable way to achieve his goals. (d) A hostile masculine personality -- This personality\nconstellation involves deep hostility toward women together with negatively defined, exaggerated 168\nmasculinity--masculinity characterized as rejecting anything feminine, such as nurturance, and\nemphasizing power, control, and macho characteristics.\nUnderstanding the factors that make some men rape-prone will be crucial for intervention programs.\nWhat other factors might be related to men sexually aggressing against women, and might these and\nother factors interact or lead to one another in a causal sequence? How could such models be tested?\nFeminist Theory\nResearch and theory about the psychology of women has been heavily influenced by feminist theory\n(e.g., Jaggar & Rothenberg, 1993; Tong, 1989), much of which has originated in the humanities. An early\nexample was Bem's (1974) theorizing and research on androgyny, which was preceded by earlier\nwritings in the humanities (Heilbrun, 1973). We have no doubt that this pattern will continue into the\n21st century, as developments in feminist theory are made in the humanities, and then translated by\npsychologists into theory that is testable with empirical data. Here we offer one recent example.\nNita McKinley and Janet Hyde (1996) developed the Objectified Body Conscious (OBC) Scale to measure\nwomen's experience of their own bodies. The research began with the writings of feminist theorists,\nwho argue that the female body is constructed as an object of male desire and exists to receive the gaze\nof the male (Spitzack, 1990). The result is that women experience objectified body consciousness\n(McKinley, 1995). OBC consists of three components: (a) body surveillance, in which the woman or girl\nviews her own body as if an external onlooker and constantly evaluates it; (b) internalization of cultural\nstandards that specify the ideal female body and the ideal for beauty; because these standards are\ninternalized, conformity seems to be a matter of personal choice rather than external pressure, and\nshame results when one fails to control one's weight or appearance; and (c) beliefs that one can control\none's appearance and weight, which can lead to unhealthy behaviors and eating disorders. Based on this\nfeminist theorizing, McKinley and Hyde (1996) developed the OBC scale to measure these three\ncomponents. Their data showed that high scores on these scales were associated with disordered\neating. Now the scales are available to those doing further research on this important topic.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the psychology of women is that it is part of the interdisciplinary\nfield of women's studies. As such, there are rich opportunities to learn from developments in other\ndisciplines and in turn to use psychology to build on those developments.\nGender and Its Intersection with Race/Ethnicity, Disability, and Sexual Orientation\nOne of the key tenets of feminist theory is that gender does not act alone, but rather acts jointly with\nrace/ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation, in influencing an individual's life experience. Here we\nprovide examples of some of this work that looks at the conjoint influence of gender and these other\nstatus characteristics.\nGender and Race/Ethnicity\nWe can see the intersection of gender with race/ethnicity most directly if we examine variations in\ngender roles across ethnic groups in the United States. For example, the evidence shows that some\nNorth American Indian tribes had a system of egalitarian gender roles, in which separate but equally\nvalued tasks were assigned to women and men and women had a strong role in government\n(Blackwood, 1984). The very work that is considered acceptable for women or men can be determined\nby one's ethnic group. 169\nAmong Asian Americans, educational attainment is highly valued and both males and females are\nexpected to meet high standards. Asian American women graduate from college at a higher rate than\nwhite men do (Hyde, 1996). There is no view that women are less worthy of education. In this case,\none's gendered aspirations are defined by one's ethnic group.\nAs these two examples indicate, we cannot begin to understand the impact of gender roles on girls and\nwomen unless we consider ethnicity simultaneously.\nGender and Disability\nFew individual characteristics rival gender in their salience or impact in social situations, but disability is\none of them. It is surprising that only a small body of research exists on the interaction of gender and\ndisability; we believe that this literature will continue to expand in the next decade. Michelle Fine and\nAdrienne Asch (1988) have edited an interdisciplinary volume on this topic. They commented on the\ndiscrepancy between feminists strivings for independence and disabled womens assumed dependence.\nThis misconception may be one reason why disability and gender have not been extensively researched\nwithin the psychology of women.\nDespite the scarcity of research, some areas have been explored. For example, an analysis of\nautobiographies written by blind people revealed that blind women were more likely than blind men to\nseek jobs within the blind community, teaching and counseling other blind people (Asch & Sacks, 1983).\nFurthermore, blind women were less likely than blind men to refer to intimate relationships, but more\nlikely to show concern about the visible features of their disabilities.\nAnother line of research on women and disability has focussed attention on womens experiences of\nsexuality and mothering. Asrael (1982) articulated the discouragement and difficulty that disabled\nwomen face when deciding to have children, and then offered a useful model within which disabled\nwomen are described as working with a team of professionals to plan their pregnancies and deliveries.\nThis compelling idea highlights one of this areas complexities. For example, would this approach be\nappropriate for all women with disabilities? Embedded within this research topic is a challenge to\nrecognize differences and commonalities among peoples experiences who have different disabilities.\nMost of what we know in this area is descriptive in nature and is based on interviews with disabled\nwomen. Although these studies are rich with detail and are an important place to start, the underlying\nsocial and psychological processes related to womens experiences will be identified only when\nresearchers apply psychological theory to this domain.\nDisabled women (and men) have been described as members of an }invisible\" population. Although this\ndescription is true in general, some disabilities are more invisible than others and have escaped the\nattention of researchers to an even greater extent. Examples of these invisible disabilities are learning\ndisabilities, mental illness, and some physical or sensory disabilities. These individuals who can }pass\" as\nnot disabled at first glance may have unique experiences and frustrations that are not socially\nrecognized or validated. Researchers may gain insight into the nature of gender and stigma associated\nwith disability by focussing attention on how these women choose to navigate through life labelled as\ndisabled or not.\nAnother area that is rich with research possibility concerns public attitudes about women with\ndisabilities. Are women with disabilities evaluated more negatively than disabled men when they need\nto advocate for themselves? What attributions are made of their emotional behavior? In what ways do\nphysical atypicalities influence interpersonal behaviors among women with disabilities, and how do 170\nthese women deal with extreme standards of beauty and femininity that may seem contradictory to\ntheir disabilities? Approaching the topic from a more positive stance, are women with disabilities more\ncapable of challenging gender stereotypes or expectations because of their often marginalized position?\nThe answers to these questions are unknown, and the questions continue to emerge. Psychology of\nwomen has its work cut out for itself in the arena of understanding the complex relationships between\ngender and disability.\nSexual Orientation\nIssues of sexual orientation have personally touched the lives of many within the field of psychology of\nwomen and part of the research attention afforded this topic can be traced to this interest. However,\nperhaps more powerfully, psychology of women has a strong tradition of documenting and validating\nthe diversity in human experience. It is from this stance that psychology of women has tackled the very\ncomplex issues related to sexual orientation.\nLike no other area of academe, psychology of women has sought to describe and validate the\nexperiences of lesbians (Boston Lesbian Psychologies Collective, 1987; Greene & Herek, 1994; Davis,\nCole, & Rothblum, 1996; Weinstock & Rothblum, 1996). Some stereotypes have been shattered, but\nperhaps more importantly, it has become clear that there is no single lesbian experience. One important\npart of past research is that psychologists have recognized and documented the challenges facing\nlesbians who are building and maintaining relationships without the support of family, friends, and/or\nsocial institutions.\nResearch has also focussed on the qualities of lesbian relationships themselves. More specifically, these\nrelationships offer one of the only opportunities to witness the dynamics of intimate relationships\nwithout the inherent inequalities introduced by pairing women and men. Although most lesbian\nrelationships are more egalitarian than heterosexual relationships (Peplau, Cochran, Rock, & Padesky,\n1978), one finding that was surprising to some was the existence of violence within some lesbian\nrelationships (Brand & Kidd, 1986). This finding is particularly relevant to future research in this area, in\nthat investigators will continue to disentangle the network of status and power that exists between\npeople even in relationships where gender is equalized.\nIssues of sexual orientation are not limited to lesbianism. Future research will focus on bisexual women.\nBisexuality has often been brushed aside, without having an identity of its own, but gradually it is\nbecoming less marginalized. Bisexuality offers a unique situation in which women have the flexibility to\nalternate between }heterosexual\" and }homosexual\" experiences depending on whom theyre currently\ndating. The psychological and social complexities that accompany this situation, and the nature of a\nbisexual identity or identities, will be illuminated in future research (Ault, 1996; Weinberg, Williams, &\nPryor, 1994).\nFinally, research on sexual orientation will continue to address issues related to social policy. For\nexample, one line of research shows that children are not disadvantaged as a result of being raised by\nlesbian rather than heterosexual couples (Flaks, Ficher, Masterpasqua, & Joseph, 1995; Patterson,\n1992). This type of research may be influential in adoption cases where concern is raised regarding\nwhether lesbian couples are fit to be parents. Furthermore, through research, lifestyles that may seem\nmarginal to some people, become more normalized and acceptable. There is great power in showing\nthat women who are lesbian or bisexual are not necessarily different from heterosexual women on\nvariables other than sexual orientation.\nResearch Methods in the Psychology of Women 171\nResearchers within psychology of women have adopted, adapted, and cultivated a wide variety of\nresearch methods. Part of this diversity has grown out of the challenges feminist researchers encounter\nas they search for methods that will effectively answer their research questions without contradicting\ntheir feminist ideals. The selection and application of research methods is a series of tradeoffs because\neach has its strengths and weaknesses, and none is a methodological panacea. The tradeoffs typically\ncenter around two fundamental characteristics of any research endeavor: (a) whether qualitative or\nquantitative data are collected, and (b) the context in which the data were collected. For clarity, we will\ndiscuss these issues separately although they are intertwined.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Research\nRegarding the first issue, data can be either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative data come in the\nform of verbal description and are usually summarized in text, whereas quantitative data are in the form\nof numbers and are analyzed via statistical procedures. One of the most well-known studies of the\nqualitative type was conducted on womens moral reasoning by Carol Gilligan (1982). Gilligan conducted\na series of elaborate interviews with women who were making the decision of whether or not to have\nan abortion. She designed her research in response to the androcentric theory of moral reasoning\nadvanced by Kohlberg (1969) in which he pronounced women to be less mature in their moral reasoning\nthan men. In contrast, Gilligan concluded that women were not deficient in their abilities to reason\nmorally, but rather, reasoned from different premises than did men. According to Gilligan, men mainly\nuse considerations of justice in their moral reasoning, whereas women attend more to relationships and\nthe imperative to care for others. It is easy to understand how Gilligan's interview-based methodology is\ncongruent with the feminist goal of documenting and validating the lived experiences of women. This\napproach can uncover detailed information about individuals' experiences by taking into account the\ncontexts in which they live and the intricacies of their lives.\nQualitative methods such as these can definitely contribute a great deal to the field. However, due to\nthe elaborate processes by which qualitative data are collected and synthesized, these accounts typically\nrepresent the experiences of only a small number of people; thus, the virtue of this method is also its\nvice. Because of the rich detail and concern for individuals unique experiences, it is often difficult to\ndraw general conclusions.\nInvestigators using quantitative methods, in contrast, frame and seek to answer research questions\nusing statistical techniques. For example, participants may be asked to report their attitudes on a scale\nfrom say, 1 to 7, and by doing this they are quantifying their attitudes rather than describing them in\ntheir own words. Although there is considerable utility (for example, one can collect data on a large,\nrandom sample) in being able to summarize people's attitudes in this manner, this benefit comes at a\ncost. It is likely, if not inevitable, that part of individuals richness and depth are lost when they are asked\nto report information in this way. In summarizing the distinction between qualitative and quantitative\nmethods then, we might say that whereas the benefit of qualitative data is depth, the benefit of\nquantitative data is breadth.\nContextual and Design Factors in Research\nAnother important methodological distinction is between naturalistic and laboratory studies.\nNaturalistic investigations are conducted in the environments where people live, work, and play, rather\nthan in laboratories. Because feminists stress the importance of context, many would suggest that it is\nnot optimal to strip these important factors away from the setting in which research is conducted, as in\nlaboratory studies. However, there is also much to be gained from laboratory research. Superfluous 172\ncontextual factors that may muddle a researchers understanding of a particular phenomenon can be\nremoved from studies in laboratories.\nPsychological experiments, more specifically, introduce their own costs and benefits. In an experiment,\nthe researcher seeks to demonstrate the causal effects of one entity (the independent variable) on\nanother (the dependent variable). When this is done in the laboratory, contextual factors except for the\ncausal entity need to be minimized or controlled. Thus, the \"all powerful\" experimenter attempts to\nstrip away contextual factors that might add \"noise\" to the data. Then, typically unbeknownst to the\nparticipants, the experimental environment is manipulated or altered in some way and then the\nparticipants are asked to respond. This manipulation (and sometimes deception) produces a situation in\nwhich a hierarchical relationship is constructed between the experimenter and the participants. The\nexperimenter has considerable power over the situation and control over the participants. This power\ndifferential has the potential of leading the participants to feel exploited or demoralized, which is the\nantithesis of the outcome that feminist researchers seek.\nIntegrating Research Approaches\nAlthough quantitative methods and laboratory experimentation have their flaws from a feminist point of\nview, we contend that the discipline has nonetheless benefited a great deal from these approaches.\nPowerful feminist arguments have been substantiated from their use. For example, only by quantitative\nmethods is it possible to document the widespread violence against women on college campuses (e.g.,\nKoss, 1987) and only with experimental methods can one investigate the direct causal effects of gender-\nbiased language (Hyde, 1984). To illustrate, one of us (JH) conducted an experiment to determine\nwhether childrens perceptions of a fictitious occupation (wudgemaking) were influenced by the\npronouns used to describe people who did this for a living (Hyde, 1984). She found that participants\nrated women as only moderately competent at the task when the pronoun was masculine, but their\nratings rose when either a gender-fair or feminine pronoun was used. The use of the experimental\nmethod allowed the researcher to determine the influence of masculine, feminine, or gender-fair\npronouns on childrens perceptions of this fictitious occupation. It is also noteworthy that although the\nchildren in this study were in an experiment, they most likely were not led to feel manipulated or\ncontrolled.\nIssues concerning hierarchy and control can emerge in almost any research setting. For example,\npersonal and professional responsibilities may be blurred in an ongoing interview study, where intimate\ninformation is passed from participant to investigator. Thus, even qualitative, non-laboratory\nresearchers face ethical challenges in navigating the path between data collection and interpersonal\nexploitation or invasion of privacy. Laboratory experimentation, however, has been most highly\ncriticized by feminists. First, to provide a balanced view, it is notable that participants are at minimal risk\nin most laboratory experimental research. Furthermore, the ethics of research procedures are\nmonitored by a designated board of people who review all proposed research with human participants,\nso long as the research is conducted within a university context (a practice that also is followed with\nresearch that is not experimental). In addition, recognizing the usefulness of laboratory studies,\nfeminists have made strides in improving the situations into which research participants enter. Landrine,\nKlonoff, and Brown-Collins (1992) have made several suggestions of how feminist psychologists can alter\ntheir methods to coincide more with feminist ideals. For example, they suggested that researchers\nprovide monetary compensation for participants service and never coerce participation as part of a\ncourse requirement. Moreover, in an ideal world, research would be designed so that the people under\ninvestigation actually benefited from participation. 173\nWe suggest that the methods just discussed have different strengths and weaknesses and compliment\neach other well. Used in tandem, these methods may prove to be extremely useful in terms of leading to\nour greater understanding of gender and its intersection with other social and cultural phenomena. For\nexample, an area of research may at first be investigated qualitatively to determine what topics are\nimportant to participants lives. Then, once these more specific aspects are identified, they can be\ninvestigated via quantitative methods. Qualitative and quantitative methods might also be used\niteratively. That is, the first study on a question might be qualitative, followed by a quantitative study,\nfollowed by a qualitative study designed to clarify the findings of the quantitative research, and so on.\nDeborah Tolman and Laura Szalacha (in press) provided an excellent example of multiple-method\nresearch on adolescent girls experiences of sexual desire. Narrative data from 30 girls were collected,\nand then the data were summarized both qualitatively and quantitatively. The researchers were able to\nsummarize the data at multiple levels of specificity. They reported overall patterns using statistical\nanalysis and then returned to the original narrative data to capture the richness of individual girls\nexperiences and to explore the nature of the overall patterns. This type of research should inspire\nresearchers within psychology of women to liberate their research questions and paradigms from the\nconstraints of rigid boundaries between methodologies.\nAs psychology in general continues to progress away from a positivist perspective (Hare-Mustin &\nMarecek, 1988), peoples varied experiences within a given situation will be recognized as important. In\nthis way, the psychological meaning of a situation, as constructed by participants, will become more\ncentral and thus press the empirical methods used in psychology to be more diverse and flexible. A\nchallenge to researchers in psychology of women is to lead the way in this use of multiple methods. This\napproach may be more difficult than it seems at first glance. One area in which attention can be\nfocussed in order to bring this about concerns the training of scholars in these diverse methods.\nTypically, one is trained to be either a quantitative or qualitative researcher. This boundary needs to be\nbroken and open dialogue should occur between researchers using both approaches. A second area in\nwhich gains need to be made is in the evaluative criteria for qualitative methods. There is general\nconsensus in psychology about what methods are acceptable among quantitative approaches (e.g.,\nappropriateness of statistical tests, adequacy of comparison groups), but this is less true of qualitative\nmethods. Guidelines have begun to be defined (e.g., Guba & Lincoln, 1989; Olesen, 1994) and these\nshould continue to be developed so that adopting qualitative methods from other backgrounds will feel\nmore confident in this methodology.\nFinally, given that we embark on our research with a clear feminist perspective, it is important for the\npsychology of women that we make every attempt to communicate to others our message and our\nresearch in a way that others will }listen\" to and respond to affirmatively. It is imperative for feminist\npsychologists to conduct careful, well-planned research so that our results will be respected and taken\nseriously. Only by conveying our research in a way that is compelling to psychology as a whole will we be\nsuccessful in accomplishing our goals and improving the lives of women.\nApplications of Psychology of Women in the Real World\nPublic Policy\nOne of the most neglected public policy issues in the United States is parental leave, which refers to the\nleave from work that a mother or father takes at the time of the birth (or adoption) of a baby (Hyde,\nEssex, Clark, Klein, & Byrd, 1996). We offer this issue as an example of the ways in which psychological\nresearch can have an impact in the policy arena. In 1985, the United States was the only developed 174\nnation to have no national policy providing parental leave for new parents. In 1993, the federal Family\nand Medical Leave Act (FMLA) became law. It provides for a minimum leave of 12 weeks for new\nmothers or fathers. The leave must be job-guaranteed -- that is, the employee has the right to return to\nthe same job or a comparable one. The minimum requirement is for unpaid leave, but employers may\nbe more generous and provide paid leave. These requirements hold only for persons employed by a\ncompany that has 50 or more employees; small businesses are not required to comply. This policy is\nconsiderably less generous than policies in European nations.\nWhen Congress was considering whether to pass the FMLA, it called on psychologists to provide expert\ntestimony. The research of experts -- most of whom were developmental psychologists and testified\nthat infants need 4 to 6 months with their mother, father, or other stable caregiver in order to form a\nsecure attachment, which is crucial for later adjustment -- was instrumental in passing the bill.\nOur research team, examining the expert testimony, noticed that it focused exclusively on infants and\ntheir well-being, and that the well-being of mothers had been ignored. We launched a project, the\nWisconsin Maternity Leave and Health Project, to provide data on this crucial issue and, we hoped, to\ninform future public policy decisions (Hyde et al., 1996; Hyde, Klein, Essex, & Clark, 1995). We found, for\nexample, that a short leave (6 weeks or less) acts as a risk factor, when combined with other risk factors\nsuch as a troubled marriage, for elevated levels of depressive symptoms in women. We also found that\n66% of the women took a shorter leave than they would have preferred (Hyde et al., 1996). The reason?\nFinances. Most could not afford to stay away from work any longer, when the leave was unpaid. The\nresults from this project should help to inform decisions about parental leave policy in the future. They\nbuild a strong case for strengthening the current legislation to provide for paid leave.\nEfficacy of Therapy\nOne of the hot questions in psychology today is whether various forms of psychotherapy \"work\" -- an\nissue variously known as the efficacy of therapy or empirically supported therapies (Chambless & Hollon,\n1998; Compas, Haaga, Keefe, Leitenberg, & Williams, 1998). This question has been asked of feminist\ntherapy and of therapies used to treat disorders in which a preponderance of the affected people are\nwomen, e.g., eating disorders (e.g., Compas et al., 1998).\nIs feminist therapy effective? The bottom line is that we do not have enough good research to be able to\nanswer the question. Ideally, an evaluation study should randomly assign clients to feminist therapy or\nno therapy (the latter group receives therapy later, after the research is completed), and then evaluates\nthe clients at the end of therapy compared with the no-treatment controls. We know of no study that\nhas used such a design. One of the few relevant studies compared women in feminist therapy with\nwomen in traditional therapy (Marecek, Kravetz, & Finn, 1979). Unfortunately, the women had selected\nthe therapy themselves rather than being randomly assigned, so we cannot be certain whether\ndifferences between the groups were a result of the different therapies or pre-existing differences.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of feminist therapy will surely be an important research topic in the next\ndecade. Two distinct questions can be asked: (a) Is feminist therapy effective compared with no\ntherapy? and (b) Is feminist therapy as effective or more effective than traditional therapies? Beyond\nthat, we can ask more complex questions, such as whether feminist therapy is particularly effective in\ntreating certain problems. The first question is important and feasible to answer. The second question\nprobably will not lend itself easily to research because most feminist therapists incorporate elements of\ntraditional therapies into their treatment, as appropriate to the particular problem (Enns, 1993). It\nwould therefore be difficult to separate out the effect of the particular feminist components. 175\nForensic Psychology of Women\nA substantial number of feminist psychologists -- some of them academic researchers, some of them\nfeminist therapists -- work in the area of forensic psychology. This area may include analysis of\npsychological harm arising from trauma (e.g., domestic violence, sexual harassment), evaluation of\nparents in child custody cases, or preparing an attorney to cross-examine an accused rapist (for a\nreview, see Brown, in press). Feminist forensic psychologists develop their expert opinions based on a\ncombination of basic research in the psychology of women and accumulated clinical experience of\nthemselves and others in treating women who have experienced such traumas. In this role, they\nstrongly influence legal outcomes. Examples include judgments about whether a mother loses custody\nof her children following a divorce, whether a woman can sue an employer for damages on account of\npsychological trauma she suffered as a result of sexual harassment on the job, and whether an accused\nrapist is convicted.\nAs one specific example, feminist forensic psychologists gradually accumulated an argument that was\nupheld in many legal cases. Specifically, they argued that a battered woman might well be in constant\nfear for her life, even if a knife was not held to her throat at a particular moment; therefore, if she killed\nher batterer, it could reasonably be regarded as self-defense (Brown, in press). Feminist forensic\npsychology is an exciting area that doubtless will expand in the future.\nAdvice to Aspiring Feminist Researchers\nOne of the most important goals of feminist psychologists is the improvement of the lives of girls and\nwomen and a commitment to that goal will surely extend into the 21st century. If we are to improve the\nlives of girls and women, so many areas desperately need more research and more talented researchers.\nWe have only begun to glimpse the complex behavioral and cultural mechanisms that will help us\nunravel the puzzles before us in feminist topics, such as sexual assault, sexual harassment, eating\ndisorders, homophobia, the double whammy of racism and sexism. Without basic research to give us an\nunderstanding of these issues, we cannot hope to be effective in treating those affected by these\nproblems, much less in preventing them.\nIf you want to pursue a graduate degree specializing in feminist psychology, you will need to be\nespecially careful in accepting the appropriate graduate program. For example, not every department is\nsupportive of feminist approaches. Some may actively discourage research related to women and\ngender. If possible, select a university that is strong in both psychology and womens studies. Ideally, you\nshould take graduate courses in womens studies as well as psychology.\nMentorship is also a significant factor in establishing a successful research program as a feminist\npsychologist. Interview faculty members in the department who express an interest in feminist\npsychology. Find out which feminist psychologists have graduate student positions available. Then find\nout if those individuals would be willing to work with you specifically. Chances are that feminist mentors\nmay be especially supportive in helping you survive the rigors of graduate training.\nMany entire textbooks have been written about the psychology of women and gender (e.g., Hyde,\n1996). Our coverage here has been necessarily brief and has omitted much. As we think forward to the\n21st century, we have a solid foundation of three decades of research and theory on which to build. It is\nexciting to be part of this effort. Feminist researchers especially welcome new researchers into the fold\nwho can continue to work energetically for causes important to girls and women. We think that it is\nexciting to be part of this effort. 176\nReferences\nAsch, A., & Sacks, L. (1983). Lives without, lives within: The autobiographies of blind women and\nmen.

An interest in the structure of sensory systems and the nature of human perception predates\npsychology. In fact, research in this area in the early and middle 1800\u00eds was instrumental in creating the\nacademic climate that gave rise to psychology as a distinct scientific field.\nThe year 1879 is often cited as the date of the founding of psychology, marked by the establishment of\nWundt\u00eds experimental laboratory. The year 1860 is probably a better choice, however. This is the year\nthat Fechner published his book Elements of Psychophysics (Boring, 1950). Fechner (below) described a\nset of methods for studying and quantifying the relationship between sensory stimuli and perceptual\nexperiences. The realization that the relationships between stimulus events and mental events might be\nreducible to simple laws apparently occurred to Fechner while lying in bed on the morning of October\n22nd, 1850 (Schultz & Schultz, 1996). This early work on the relationship between sensation and\nperception and the accuracy of the perceptual representations of sensory stimuli made up a substantial\nportion of the bedrock of early experimental psychology. Now, scientists celebrate Fechner Day\n(October 22nd) each year with scientific meetings and other events in remembrance of this contribution\nto our field.\nGustav Fechner (1801-1887)\nImage from the International Society for Psychophysics\nThe intervening 150 years of research on sensation and\nperception has led to technological advances in\nexperimental apparatus, the discovery of new research\nmethods for gathering observations, and the addition\nof advanced quantitative methods for describing and\nanalyzing psychophysical data.\nIn the very early days, researchers in sensation and\nperception had fairly similar training and\ninterests. Quite rapidly, however, work in the area\ndiverged to include a broad set of research areas and\nscientific approaches. Today, the general area of\nsensation and perception is composed of researchers\nwith vastly different training, and psychologists make\nup only a small percentage of these individuals. As\nsensory psychologists approach the millennium, they\nare re-examining their theoretical approaches to the\ntraditional problems in the field, their selection of\nproblems to investigate is heavily influenced by work 181\nin related fields (e.g. neuroscience), and they have become more applied.\nDepth perception is a good example of the diversity of training and theoretical approach of today\u00eds\nresearchers in sensation and perception. Some sensory psychologists study how we use depth cues to\nhelp perform object recognition (de Vries, Kappers, & Koenderink, 1993) or to perform a visual search\n(O\u00edToole & Walker, 1997). Others study how we recover 3-D shapes from motion cues (Lappin, Doner, &\nKotas, 1980; Todd & Norman, 1991) or how we use depth cues to move through natural environments\n(Palmisano, 1996) or virtual ones (Cutting, 1997). In addition, neuroscientists study disparity sensitive\ncortical cells (Chino, Smith, Hatta & Cheng, 1997), optometrists study binocular function in the presence\nof strabismus or amblyopia (Yu & Levi, 1997), and biologists study depth perception in animals\n(Pettigrew & Konishi, 1976; Collett & Harkness; 1982).\nAlthough scientific heterogeneity defines our field today, advances in the neurosciences heavily\ninfluence research in sensation and perception. This impact is understandable; we have made great\nstrides in our understanding of the brain and we have developed exciting new research methods for\ninvestigating it. Only a handful of sensory psychologists would classify themselves as behavioral\nneuroscientists. However, most psychologists today are unlikely to investigate perceptual phenomena\nwithout at some point considering how their psychophysical data relate to the underlying sensory\nphysiology or to brain organization.\nSensation and Perception Today\nIn the late 1990's sensation and perception consists of many exciting research areas. These areas\nrepresent an expansive continuum from studies directed at the earliest, \u00eclow-level\u00ee stages of sensory\nprocessing to those directed at later \u00echigh-level\u00ee perceptual mechanisms.\nIn this chapter we consider examples of what we feel are exciting areas of research in sensation and\nperception from both ends of this continuum, with an emphasis on the current state of the\ndiscipline. These examples, then, are primarily from the areas of vision and visual perception and\nrepresent both basic and applied science. We conclude with a brief discussion of possible future\ndirections for the discipline, using as an example research in the area of virtual reality. Because it\ncurrently drives a great deal of the research and thinking in sensation and perception, we begin with\ncurrent explorations in the area of visual neuroscience.\nIn the late 1990's sensation and perception consists of many exciting research areas. These areas\nrepresent an expansive continuum from studies directed at the earliest, \"low-level\" stages of sensory\nprocessing to those directed at later \"high-level\" perceptual mechanisms.\nIn this chapter we consider examples of what we feel are exciting areas of research in sensation and\nperception from both ends of this continuum, with an emphasis on the current state of the\ndiscipline. These examples, then, are primarily from the areas of vision and visual perception and\nrepresent both basic and applied science. We conclude with a brief discussion of possible future\ndirections for the discipline, using as an example research in the area of virtual reality. Because it\ncurrently drives a great deal of the research and thinking in sensation and perception, we begin with\ncurrent explorations in the area of visual neuroscience.\nVisual Neuroscience\nThe study of the biological basis of sensation and perception is a fascinating areas of study for two\nreasons. The first reason is that the pace of discovery is breathtaking. It seems that every few weeks a\nnew set of findings challenges our conceptions of how the brain processes sensory information. The 182\nsecond reason is interrelated with the first. In many ways, the understanding of how the brain processes\nsensory and perceptual information is used as a basis for understanding how the cerebral cortex, as a\nwhole, operates. The cerebral cortex is where it is believed that our most advanced functions\nreside. The most extreme version of this approach is seen in Zeki's (1993) Vision of the Brain. Zeki\nunapologetically uses the knowledge of the architecture and function of the visual areas of the cortex to\ndevelop some general ideas about cerebral cortex. While most researchers will not go quite so far, it is\ncertain that some general insights about cerebral cortex will come out of the study of the sensory\ncortices. A brief review of the current knowledge of the visual system and how it has changed in the last\n30 years will illustrate these points.\nThe idea that the brain operates with many parallel elements is the major emerging theme in our\npresent understanding of the neural bases of the sensory systems; different pathways and different\nmodules of the sensory systems operate to extract unique features of the information in the sensory\nstimulus. Throughout the sensory systems, there is evidence of parallel (that is simultaneous)\noperations, both with parallel pathways and parallel targets for sensory information.\nSensory information processing was first viewed as predominantly serial (that is sequential), based upon\nthe groundbreaking work of Hubel and Wiesel (1962, 1968). However, even in these early studies\nresearchers began to find evidence of parallel processing.For example, Hubel and Wiesel uncovered the\nexistence of cortical columns. In a cortical column, all cells process the same feature of the environment\nfrom the same location on the retina. For example, one column processes oriented stimuli of a certain\nwidth from a certain location on the retina; the next column processes stimuli with a slightly different\norientation. Each column is organized in a parallel fashion processing information simultaneously.\nFigure 1. An illustration of the difference between serial and parallel processing. Serial processing is in\nstages and parallel processing is different processes proceeding at the same time. [Figure 1 description]\nAnother important early finding that foreshadowed today\u00eds emphasis on parallel processing was the\nstudy of cat retinal ganglion cells by Christina Enroth-Cugell and John Robson (1966). Enroth-Cugell and\nRobson identified two types of cells in the feline retina, named X and Y cells, that responded very\ndifferently to specific features of light stimuli. X cells tend to respond consistently throughout the time\nthat the stimulus was presented, had relatively small receptive fields, and required fairly high contrast. Y\ncells, in contrast, tend to respond primarily to stimulus onsets and offsets and do not respond well to a\nstimulus that does not change over time (see Figure 2). Also, the receptive fields of y cells tend to be 183\nlarger and require less contrast. These findings, which have been replicated and extended to primates,\nclearly indicate that there is something fundamentally parallel in the processing of visual\ninformation. Studies by Hubel and Wiesel (1968) found a similar functional segregation in the cortex\nbetween their simple and complex cells although at the time they interpreted these cells as sequentially\nlinked.\nFigure 2. The response patterns of X versus Y cells. [Figure 2 description]\nAt the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus, for example, the visual system is still divided into\ntwo main pathways. The LGN is a composed of six layers in the primate. Two of the layers have relatively\nlarge cell bodies and are called magnocellar layers while the other four layers have relatively small cell\nbodies and are called parvocellular layers (Lennie, Trevarthen, Van Essen and Waessle, 1990). The -\ncellular suffix is often dropped and the two types of cells are called magno and parvo or even M and\nP. The magno and parvo cells show very different response patterns. In fact, the response patterns are\nvery similar to the X and Y ganglion cells seen in the cat retina. In addition, the parvo pathways carry\ncolor information. There is a tendency to apply these distinctions, based initially upon anatomy of the\nLGN, to the retinal ganglion cells. There is a lot of functional similarity between the magno and Y\nsystems and the parvo and X systems. For example, the magno and Y systems have larger receptive\nfields and have transient response patterns. Similarly both the parvo and X systems have smaller\nreceptive fields and more sustained response patterns. The Y cells even have relatively large cell bodies\njust like the Magno cells of the LGN and X cells have relatively small cell bodies like the Parvo cells of the\nLGN. The overlap of functions and anatomy of the retinal and LGN systems allows this distinction to be\nnicely applied. See Table 1 for a summary of the distinction between x/parvo and y/magno systems.\nTable 1\nA Summary of the X/Parvo and Y/Magno systems of the retina, LGN\n___________________________________________________________\nFeature X/Parvo Y/Magno\nResponse pattern Sustained Transient\nReceptive Field Size Smaller Larger 184\nContrast Sensitivity Relatively Low Relatively High\nColor Sensitivity Yes No\nThe first stop for visual information in the cortex is the striate cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe at the very\nback of the brain. A little geometry of the cortex is helpful. First, all parts of the neocortex are composed\nof six layers and each of these layers are involved in the same type of function regardless of where that\nlayer is on the cortex. For example, the fourth layer from the surface of the brain, Layer 4, always\nreceives input from sensory systems (see Kolb and Whishaw, 1996, for a more detailed review of the\norganization of the cortex). In the sensory areas of the brain, such as the Visual cortex, this layer is very\nthick. This layer stains very darkly, which gives this first part of the visual cortex its name of striate\ncortex (See Figure 3).\nBrain Surface\nInside of the Brain\nFigure 3. An illustration of the layers of the cortex as might be see in V1. Layer 4 is where the input from\nthe LGN occurs and is the thickest layer here. It stains darkly giving this region one of its names, the\nstriate cortext. [Figure 3 description]\nWithin the striate cortex (V1) the parvo and magno pathways are now segregated into three separate\nunits that function independently: blobs, interblobs, and Layer 4b (Wong-Riley, 1979). Blobs receive\ninputs from both the magno and parvo system and seem to play an important role in the processing of\ncolor. Interblobs receive inputs from only the parvo system and seem to process fine patterns in the\nstimulus. Layer 4b is a subpart of one of the six layers of the neocortex. Its input is solely from the\nmagno system and these cells seem to respond to motion and very low contrast. Thus, the two parallel\npathways have divided now into three pathways. These pathways from the LGN to the striate cortex are\nsummarized in Figure 4 . 185\nFigure 4. The relationship of the layers in the LGN to the different functional parts of V1, the striate\ncortex. [Figure 4 description]\nIn the primate, five visual areas have been identified and given the clever names of V1, V2, V3, V4 and\nV5. Each section is anatomically distinct and is thought to perform different functions relevant to our\nperception of the world. A simplified view of how these regions are connected is shown in Figure 5. The\ncurrent evidence suggests that V3 is involved with the processing of form, V4 with color constancy, and\nV5 complex motion processing. Some of these findings have been supported by the study of lesions in\nthe occipital cortex. For example, a person with a lesion of the human region analogous to primate V4\non the left side of the brain, would report having no color vision in the right half of their visual world\n(Zeki, 1993). 186\nFigure 5. A simplified diagram of the interconnections between different regions of the cortex. [Figure 5\ndescription]\nIn addition to all of the connections from V1 and V2 to V3, V4 and V5, each of these regions connects\nback to V1 and V2. These seemingly backward or reentrant connections are not well understood but one\npossible role for them is to index the processing in V3, V4 and V5 to the more precise visual maps found\nin V1 and V2. Although each of the visual regions has a map of the visual world, they are not nearly as\nprecise and detailed as those found in V1 and V2. In other words, their receptive fields are much larger\nwhich allows for poorer localization of a stimulus or object. For example, although V4 locates a color\nregion in space, the receptive field is rather large and might not indicate whether this color belongs to\nthe cup or the book on the table in front of you. These reentrant connections, feeding back to the\nprecise maps of V1 and V2 may provide a mechanism that allows the visual system to assign the color\nprecisely to the appropriate location and object, say a part of the cover of the book in front of you.\nOur present understanding of the visual system is very different from the serial model Hubel and Wiesel\ninitially proposed. There are separate functional modules that operate relatively independently;\ninformation, instead of flowing in one direction, now flows both directions. Thus, later levels do not\nsimply receive information and send it forward, but are in an intimate two-way communication with\nother modules. 187\nThis emerging and modular and parallel view of the visual cortex has helped us better understand some\nterrible but fortunately rare disorders of the visual system. They are achromatopsia and\nakinetopsia. Achromatopsia refers to a selective loss of color vision, usually as a result of stroke (Zeki,\n1990). It is important to note that the loss seems to be selective to color vision. These patients can read,\nrecognize patterns, and respond to motion. In fact, current research indicates that little if any other\nvisual function is lost, with the exception of occasional but temporary loss of form vision immediately\nfollowing the injury (Sacks & Wasserman, 1987). These patients describe the world as being very drab\nand gray. It might be like permanently viewing the world on an old black and white TV set. Apparently\nthis is not a very bright TV set either. With this modular view of the brain, it is possible to understand\nhow a patient might lose color vision only. Loss of the human equivalent of V4 would take out color\nvision selectively. PET scans on these human patients that allow doctors to examine the living\nfunctioning brain, find hat the lesions in achromatopsia is found in V4 (Sacks & Wasserman, 1987).\nAkinetopsia is basically the same type of syndrome, only the person looses the perception of motion\n(Zihl, von Cramon, & Mai, 1983). The patient can only see objects as stationary. They might be perceived\nin different places at different times but they are not perceived to be moving. At each place they are\nperceived to be still. Imagine the danger of crossing the street with this condition. This syndrome is\nassociated with damage to visual cortex V5, mentioned above. A with achromatopsia, other visual\nfunctions are spared. The person sees in color and can read, for example. Again, our developing modular\nview of the brain allows these syndromes to be clearly understood.\nWhere does the study of the biological basis of the brain go from here? Probably in two or three\ndirections. One direction certainly will be the further breaking down of the different sensory\nregions. Subregions for each of the primary visual areas will be discovered for each of the visual areas\ndiscovered so far and new regions will probably be discovered. Some have already been found. For\nexample, while we have a sense for the processing of form, color, and motion, we do not yet know\nclearly how the brain functions to process depth and texture. A second direction for future research will\nbe how information from these regions is used by the rest of the brain. The neural pathways to the\nparietal and temporal lobes have been described but little is known about how sensory information is\nintegrated with more cognitive functions. A third possible path would be to better understand how\nthese separate modules lead to unified perceptions. While color can be selectively lost, color is not\nusually perceived separately from the object.Somehow, that fact, and other integrative perceptual\nexperiences, needs to be a part of our understanding of the brain.\nThe discovery of the extent of parallel processing in sensory systems has greatly changed how we\nconceptualize sensory information processing. This work has been coupled with a grown in the use of\nthe computer to understand the operation of the visual system.\nComputational Approaches to Sensation and Perception\nAlong with the rapid development of visual neuroscience, there has been an equally rapid development\nof computational approaches to understanding perception. These approaches ranges from models of\nlarge scale like that of Marr (1985) effort at a unified computational theory to more limited efforts such\nas Krantz, Silverstein, & Yeh's (1992) model of visibility of displays underdynamic lighting. In this section\na brief presentation on one computational model being developed by one of the authors will be\npresented to illustrate some of the power of these models (Krantz, 2000).\nThe motivations for this effort comes largely from teaching some of the concepts in the last section on\nVisual Neuroscience. Basically the effort is to try to examine the impact and function of the receptive\nfields from the retinal ganglion cells, particularly the x cells. 188\nTake a look at the figure here. [Description of visual display]\nThe center does not change in any way. Does it look that way. The same is true for the two center\nsquares below - they are identical.\nFigure 6. Simultaneous Contrast [Figure 6 description]\nThis effect is called simultaneous contrast. The model that has been developed will plot the output of\nmany of these cells in a regular array - like an x and y grid. Figure 7 shows the output of this model for\nusing the same simultaneous contrast image as in Figure 6. The receptive fields illustrated are small and\nwould be very good at resolving fine details. The intersections of lines on the figure show where the\ncenter of a receptive field was located. So the x and y axes, defining the horizontal plane, represent a set\nof cells. The height of the surface in the figure represents how fast that cell would respond according to\nthe model. The higher the point on the graph the faster the cell responds. 189\nFigure 7. The model output for a simultaneous contrast image. [Figure 7 description]\nThere are several interesting and important features of this figure. The most noticeable thing in the\noutput of the model is the edges. If the receptive field does not have an edge in it, then the cell has\nabout the same output whether the input is bright (white), moderately bright (gray) or dark\n(black). Light filling the entire receptive field is not an effective stimulus for the cell (Kuffler, 1953). So\nedges are excellent stimuli for cells and that shows up in model in Figure 7 (Troy & Enroth-Cugell,\n1993). This finding that only the edges are sent back to the brain for processing agrees with the general\nfinding about vision and it's filling-in of areas. This same process seems to play a role in why we do not\nsee our blind spots.\nNow, look at the edges a little more closely. Notice that the hills are next to brighter regions and valleys\nare next to darker regions. In particular, look at the big hills and valleys where the back background\nmeets the light background (Figures 6 and 7). The square on the left has a hill next to it suggesting it is\nlight and the square on the left has a valley right next to it suggesting a dark regions. This is exactly the\nillusion. I offer a more complete description of this model, its development, and how it helps us to\nunderstand how we see in Krantz (2000).\nThis model is barely at the beginning of its development. There are many ways to expand this model in\nthe future. So far only X cell responses in the fovea have really been examined. Some of the possible\nextensions are to model Y cells, add color responses (DeValois & DeValois, 1975), and make the modeled\neye jiggle just a little bit all the time like it does in real life (Carpenter, 1977).\nWhile visual neuroscience and computational approaches seem to play a role in revealing new\nphenomena, reexamination of what are thought to be well established findings can also yield new\ninsights. A recent advance in studies of the earliest stages of sensory information processing was the\nstunning discovery that the human eye contains a greater variety of cone photoreceptors than\npreviously thought. 190\nHuman color vision and the cone photoreceptors\nColor is a fundamental visual feature that imparts a richness to the man-made or natural world. Color\nvision has long fascinated those with an interest in sensation and perception. Isaac Newton (1730/1979),\nin his famous experiments using prisms to produce and mix colored lights, deduced that \u00eccolor\u00ee is not a\nproperty of light wavelengths per se, but rather a property of the eye. This raises an interesting\nquestion: Do all eyes perceive colors similarly? The answer is no.\nMany of the interesting research questions in this area have been directed at individual differences\namong humans and inter-species differences. The rationale for this is straightforward: An understanding\nof \"how\" and \"why\" these differences exist will tell us a great deal about how color vision is achieved by\nthe eye and brain.\nOne of the most fascinating features of color vision is the fact that, more than any other aspect of\nperception, color vision shows large individual differences both across and within species. Not all\nanimals, in fact not even all humans, share the same color experiences. For many species, including\nhumans, there are even differences between males and females. Oddly enough, there are species of\nmonkey where most of the females have normal color vision but all the males are color-deficient\n(Jacobs, 1998). We consider below some exciting recent advances in our understanding of human color\nvision.\nA long-standing and fundamental property of human vision is trichromacy. The trichromatic theory\nexplains our color perceptions and color discriminations. The anatomical basis of trichromacy begins\nwith the complement of cone photoreceptors in the retina. For over one hundred years researchers\nthought that the color-normal eye contained three cone types whose photopigments were later\npsychophysically estimated to have peak spectral sensitivities near 440, 540, and 560 nanometers. A\nFigure showing the spectral sensitivities of these pigments, across the visible spectrum, is shown below:\nFigure 9. The relative sensitivity to different light wavelengths is shown for each cone photopigment.\nNote the overlap in sensitivity of the middle wavelength sensitive and long wavelength sensitive cone\ntypes. [Figure 9 description]\nOver the years, however, psychologists questioned whether subtle variations may exist in normal color\nvision based on small individual differences in the spectral sensitivities of the photopigments (Alpern & 191\nWake, 1977; Neitz & Jacobs, 1986). The findings of the early studies were viewed with some skepticism,\nhowever, because of the difficulty in ruling out measurement error and confounding factors. As the\npsychophysical evidence grew, researchers began to investigate this possibility from many angles.\nToday, psychophysical (Neitz & Jacobs, 1990; Mollon, 1992), microspectrophotometric (Dartnall,\nBowmaker, & Mollon, 1983), and molecular genetic studies (Nathans, Piantanida, Eddy, Shows, &\nHogness, 1986; Winderickx et al., 1992) provide evidence of substantial variation in the number and\nspectral sensitivity of the cone types in the color-normal eye (also see Mollon, Cavonius, and Zrenner,\n1998). The evidence now suggests the presence of three families of normally occurring cone\nphotopigments. There is thought to be only one photopigment with a peak spectral sensitivity in the\nshortwavelengths (blue), but there is now evidence that there are multiple middlewavelength (green)\nphotopigments and multiple longwavelength (red) photopigments. The difference in spectral sensitivity\namong he middlewavelength pigments or among the longwavelength pigments has been estimated to\nbe approximately 5-7nm(Neitz, Neitz, & Jacobs, 1995). A representation of all these pigments is shown\nin the figure below:\nFigure 10. A representation of all the identified cone photopigments.\nIt is easy to see how two avoided detection for so long--they are nearly identical to two others. [Figure\n10 description]\nMolecular genetic analyses show that individuals may inherit a surprisingly large number of different X-\nlinked, recessive genes that encode the production of these photopigments (Neitz, Neitz, & Grishok,\n1995). A representation of different gene arrangements is shown below. An obvious question is why do\nwe have so many color vision genes? The genes that encode the middle and longwavelength sensitive\npigments reside near the end of one of the arms of the X chromosome and they have very similar DNA\nsequences. In fact, the substitution of one amino acid in the DNA of a photopigment gene is sufficient to\ncause a change in the spectral sensitivity of that photopigment and in our color perceptions. The\nlocation and similarity of these genes makes them susceptible to the kinds of genetic errors that\nproduce multiple gene copies, as well as hybrid genes that are genetic composites of the original ones\n(Nathans, et al., 1986). 192\nFigure 11. Each rectangle represents a single color vision gene; each row of genes represents an\nobserved gene arrangement. The half red / half green genes represent hybrid genes; linked to \"unusual\"\nspectral sensitivity. [Figure 11 description]\nAt present, it appears that normal color vision results from inheriting at least one cone type from each\ncone \u00ecclass\u00ee (short, middle, and long). It is unclear, however, which complement of genes and cone types\nresult in specific types of color vision deficiency.There is a great deal of genetic variation among\nindividuals with the same type of color defect, making this work difficult. However, it appears that both\nthe type and severity of a color vision defect can be linked to the complement of different cone types in\nthe retina.Hybrid genes, which have been associated with small differences in the spectral sensitivity of\nthe photopigments, are thought to be involved.\nThese findings lead to an interesting question: if humans possess more than three cone types in their\nretina, do they still have trichromatic vision? The answer appears to be yes, presumably because the\noutputs of the different middle or longwavelength cone photoreceptors are summed together before\nleaving the retina. The resulting signals differ to a small but significant degree across individuals, though,\nbecause they affect color perception in some situations. Individuals with different complements of cone\npigments will not accept each others\u00ed color matches in the longwavelength end of the spectrum and\nthey will disagree on color names for certain wavelengths of light (Neitz, Neitz, & Jacobs, 1993). For\nexample, a particular mixture of red and green light might appear a perfect yellow to your eye, but\nappear a greenish-yellow or slightly orange to someone else. This type of color vision assessment, called\nthe Rayleigh Match, is the most accurate method for measuring color discrimination and diagnosing the\ncongenital color vision defects. Some Rayleigh match data is shown below. 193\nFigure 12. The Rayleigh matches of 94 men. The length of the \"error bars\" represent all the different\nratios of red to green light that can be mixed to make an acceptable match to a comparison yellow.\nLonger bars, therefore, represent poorer color discrimination. The individuals on each end of the figure\nhave color vision deficiencies. [Figure 12 description]\nWhereas most of the research to date has examined the color vision of men, the situation for women,\nespecially women who have a color vision deficiency or who have a family history of color deficiency, is\neven more interesting. Women, by virtue of having two X-chromosomes, inherit two sets of color vision\ngenes. The traditional view proposed that inheriting the normal complement on one or both X-\nchromosomes led to normal color vision while failing to inherit a normal complement of genes on at\nleast one X-chromosome led to defective color vision (see Mollon, 1992).\nHowever, we now know that early in development women may alternatively express genes from one or\nthe other X-chromosome and that later in development one of the X-chromosomes is\ninactivated. Consequently, a woman\u00eds retina may have regions where the cones reflect the expression of\ngenes on one X-chromosome and other areas where the cones reflect the expression of genes on the\nother chromosome. A representation of a normal distribution of cone type is shown below: 194\nFigure 13. A representation of the distribution of photoreceptors in the retina. The ratio of R / G / B\ncone types varies, but the long wavelength cones are the most prevalent; short wavelength cones the\nleast prevalent in the retina. [Figure 13 description]\nWomen who are heterozygous for the normal complement of color vision genes, therefore, may have a\n\u00ecmosaic\u00ee retina: a patchwork of color-normal and color-deficient regions (Cohn, Emmerich, & Carlson,\n1989). The nature of this mosaic depends on the inherited complement of color vision genes and on the\npoint in development that X-chromosome inactivation occurred. That is, some women heterozygous for\nthese genes may develop a color vision deficiency while others may develop normal color vision\n(Miyahara, Pokorny, Smith, Baron, & Baron, 1998). And, in fact, there are reports in the literature of\nidentical (monozygotic) twins where one twin has normal color vision and the second is color-deficient\n(Jorgenson, et al., 1992).\nIn light of these current findings, sensory psychologists and other perception researchers are probably\ndesigning psychophysical tasks to try to tease apart the nature of color processing in the eyes of\nindividuals with different complements of cone photoreceptors. The challenge will then fall to\nneuroscientists, molecular biologists, and others to support or refute our findings at the cellular level.\nFuture work for sensory psychologists will also involve investigating the extent to which these individual\ndifferences in color vision affect our interactions with our world. This knowledge is important because\nour society uses color to code information in a variety of settings, including education and\ntransportation. In many occupations color discrimination is critical, for example, in discriminating\nelectrical wiring and colored signal lights. While these individual differences are small, they may prove to\nbe problematic in some settings.\nIn contrast to the exciting research directed at the earliest stages of sensory processing, today there is\nalso substantial research interest at the other end of the S&P continuum: Research directed at higher\nlevel perceptual processes and phenomena in the gray area where perception and cognition meld. One\narea of intense research effort today is the study of visual search: The ability to scan our visual world,\nquickly distinguish among a variety of objects or forms, and locate and identify a specific target. 195\nVisual Search\nStudies of visual search investigate the process of looking for and identifying the presence or absence of\na specific visual stimulus (a target) embedded among other items (distracters). To date, most of the\nresearch questions that have been asked in this area have been related to the very interesting finding\nthat visual searches for some features are much easier and faster than searches for other features. Two\nnatural questions emerge from these findings: Which visual features are found quickly and easily and\nwhich visual features are not? And, of course, why are some visual searches easier than others? The\nanswers to both questions and an understanding of the mechanisms involved in visual search will\ncontribute to our understanding of the active nature of visual information processing and to the\nperceptual organization of our visual world.\nHow does this perceptual mechanism work? Although low-level stimulus features such as color or size\nplay a major role in determining the efficiency (speed) of a visual search (Geisler & Chou, 1995), other\nfactors like familiarity also play a role (Lubow & Kaplan, 1997;Wang, Cavanagh, & Green, 1994).\nAs mentioned above, one fascinating aspect of our ability to perform a visual search is that some\nphysical characteristics of stimuli allow for easy and efficient searches, whereas other stimuli result in\ndifficult and time-consuming searches. This property is often referred to as salience, and objects that\nhave high salience are perceived to \"pop-out from their surroundings. It appears that visual scenes can\nbe processed in parallel, that is, simultaneously, and pre-attentively for these items. Low salience\nobjects, on the other hand, require lengthy searches. A search for low salience objects seems to take\nplace in a serial format where item-by-item processing is required. Sometimes simply changing which\nstimulus is the target and which stimuli are the distracters changes the quality of the search from one\nmode to another. For example, Triesman & Souther (1985) found that searching for an \"Q among \"O,s\nwas an easy (parallel) task but that searching for a \"O among \"Q,s was a more difficult (serial) task and\nwe demonstrate this with the demonstrations below.\nFigure 14. This is an example of searching for a \"Q\" among a small array of \"O's\". Clicking on the button\nlabeled \"Start\" will present the stimulus array for a brief 100msec. This is an example of a parallel\nsearch: the \"Q\" pops out and you have no difficulty seeing it despite the very short duration of the\ndisplay. Now try the demonstration below: [Figure 14 description] 196\nFigure 15. Same as above, but now you are searching for a \"Q\" in an array of 36 other items. Again, click\non \"Start\" to flash the array. Here, despite the fact that there is a 9-fold increase in the number of\nsearch items, you find the \"Q\" quickly. There is little if any influence of the number of items. O.k., now\ntry the demonstrations below. In the first example you will be searching for a \"O\" among \"Q's\" in an\narray of 4 items. [Figure 15 description]\nFigure 16. Again, you have no difficulty identifying the presence of the target, an \"O\" in this case, when\nthe array size is small. [Figure 16 description] Now try the following: 197\nFigure 17. Ouch! Were you lucky enough to see it? Not likely. In an array of items such as this the length\nof presentation must be considerably longer in order to allow people enough time to identify the\npresence or absence of a target \"O\". It does not pop-out. [Figure 17 description]\nSome of the additional visual features that pop-out are brightness (Gilchrist, Humphreys, Riddock, &\nNeumann, 1997), color (D,Zmura, 1991), and motion (Nothdurft, 1993). Quite often, though, we are\nsearching for objects that can only be identified by the simultaneous presence of two or more stimulus\nfeatures. These so-called conjunction searches have been studied for color and form (D,Zmura, Lennie,\n& Tiana, 1997), motion and form (Muller & Found, 1996), color and orientation (Friedman-Hill & Wolfe,\n1995), and for the conjunction of two colors or two sizes (Wolfe, 1992). Some conjunction searches are\nvery difficult and require serial processing. A good example is the children,s game \"Where,s Waldo. In\nthis popular game, children search drawings of crowded social events for one particular individual\n(Waldo) who is characteristically dressed in a red and white-stripped sweater and cap, glasses, and dark\nhair. Waldo must be distinguished from a crowd of \"distractor individuals who possess some but not all\nof these features.\nAlthough there has been extensive research on the topic of visual search over the last decade, it is\nevident that there is still much to be learned about the basic processes involved. The results of dozens of\nvisual search experiments (studying many different types of visual features and feature conjunctions)\nhas shown us that a sharp distinction between serial and parallel processing may be too simplistic\n(Wolfe, 1998). The allocation of attention in visual search probably lies along a continuum, where\nstimulus features and context determine search efficiency. This raises interesting questions for future\nresearch. For example, what situations result in optimal search efficiency? How could the search context\nfor a specific target be manipulated to maximize search efficiency?\nThe answers to these questions have a very practical value in applied settings. That is, outside the\nlaboratory in the real world. What we have learned about visual search has quickly been applied to\nmany real world situations such as air traffic control (Vortac, Edwards, Fuller, & Manning, 1993), driving\n(Lajunen, Hakkarainen, & Summala, 1996; Summala, Pasanen, Rasanen, & Sievanen, 1996), visual display\ndesign (Fisher & Tanner, 1992) and how visual displays are monitored in the workplace (Liu,\n1996). Today, questions regarding sensation and perception are increasingly being applied to problems\noutside the laboratory. 198\nApplications of Research in Sensation and Perception\nOver the years, the applications of sensation and perception have grown considerably. Today, some of\nthe areas where knowledge of sensation and perception is applied include human factors, ecological\npsychology, industrial/organizational psychology, and neuropsychology.We consider the role of\nsensation and perception in two of these fields: human factors and neuropsychology.\nHuman Factors\nOne of the fundamentally important outcomes of sensory research is the development of an important\nset of applications based upon a functional knowledge of the operation of our sensory systems. Human\nFactors is one applied field that has made great use of diverse areas of psychology including sensation\nand perception. Human Factors refers to the application of scientific knowledge of human capabilities to\nthe development of equipment (Proctor & Van Zandt, 1994). Basically, the idea behind human factors is\nto make the equipment fit the human user instead of the other way around. In other words, human\nfactors is where we make basic psychology work in the real world, which is a very exciting task.\nOne vital area of application of visual knowledge in human factors has been the development of displays\nsuch as televisions and computer monitors. Historically, the development of color televisions and\nmonitors owes much to the trichromatic theory of color vision. Beginning in 1931, the Commission\nInternationale de l\u00edEclairage (CIE) had formalized human color matching behavior using a quantitative\nmodel of the trichromatic theory, with major updates in 1960 and 1976. See Figure 18 for a depiction of\nthe 1931 CIE diagram. Even in the years prior to the measurement of the responses of the cones,\nengineers were able to make a precise prediction of the human color response. Engineers need only to\ngive a coordinate for a color in this space and, depending on the reliability of the equipment, the color\nwill be precisely duplicated on any television and monitor or even printer.\nFigure 18. The 1931 CIE color system. Colors are specified by their chormaticity coordinates (x, y). The\nspectrum is on the outside with example wavelengths given. The triangle represents the range of colors\nthat can be reproduced on a typical television (Silverstein and Merrifield, 1985). [Figure 18 description]\nBecause the visual system has a functionally trichromatic receptor layer, there are other important\nengineering simplifications in developing color television and monitors that have been made possible. In 199\nessence the trichromatic theory specifies that three primaries should be sufficient for reproducing most\ncolors we see. Thus, all modern color monitors and televisions use three color elements for color\nreproduction. These three elements are placed close enough together so that the colors are blended by\nthe spatial summation mechanisms of the eye. To show how this is a real engineering blessing, consider\nwhat might happen if we had more than three color systems in our visual system. For each additional\ncolor mechanism, the engineer would need another color element in the system to be able to match the\ncolor of the scene being caught on film or tape. If we had even octachromatic vision (eight color\nmechanisms or cones), then there would need to be eight guns on our color television and not three. It\nmight be very hard to fit all eight dots inside the limits of human spatial summation, that is, close\nenough together so that they are blended together by the visual system.\nMore recent efforts in display development have been in two primary areas. The first area is in assisting\nthe development of new display technologies so that they have the same visual excellence as the CRT\n(cathode ray tube, the technology behind the standard monitor). The second area is in developing\ndisplays for harsh visual environments such as the airplane cockpit.\nWhen the electron gun of a CRT strikes the surface of the display it stimulates several elements. The\nelements in the middle are bright and the ones at the edge are dim. This pattern of stimulation can be\ndescribed as bell shaped or gaussian. Think of the lines on the CRT as being drawn with a bright center\nand dim slightly fuzzy edges. Thus the dots in the middle of the line are brightest and the dots on the\nedge are much dimmer. Since the jagged edges of the lines are made by dim dots, they are not as\nnoticeable. If the lines are drawn directly like a pencil on paper as they are on some CRTs, then the\njagged edges are all but unnoticeable (Silverstein & Merrifield, 1985). Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD\u00eds) and\nother technologies do not have these bell shaped beams but access each element directly in a digital\nfashion. Thus, the jagged edges of lines are easily noticeable. Thus, research efforts have determined\nhow to take advantage of the way the visual system operates to most effectively and efficiently\nminimize the visibility of these jagged edges (Silverstein, Krantz, Gomer, Yeh, & Monty, 1990).\nThe airplane cockpit is a harsh environment in which to place an electronic display such as a CRT or\nLCD. If the sun is in front of the pilot, then it might take the pilot a relatively long time to be able to see\nthe much dimmer display (i.e., dark adaptation). In some flight situations even a few seconds might be\ncritical. If the sun enters the cockpit from the side window onto the display, the surface is washed out\nmaking it difficult or impossible to read and distinguish the colors of the elements. In the evening, it is\nimportant that the display not be too bright that the pilot can not see important but possibly dim targets\nin the sky or on the land. Visually oriented human factors research has focused on the stimulus intensity\nneeded on these displays so that pilots can read them accurately and quickly under the wide range of\nconditions. An important goal of these efforts is to develop an automatic control mechanism that senses\nthe ambient light visible out the front cockpit windows and the light falling on the display surface and\nautomatically adjusts the intensity of the display for the pilot (Silverstein & Merrifield, 1985; Krantz,\nSilverstein, & Yeh, 1992).\nOne important future direction for sensation and perception's application to human factors will be\ndeveloping a good general model of visual system-display interaction. With a single TV at home, this was\nnot a big issue, but with scanners and digital cameras, printers, computer monitors, and TVs all at home\nthe difference in color from one display to the next can be very great and disappointing. Obviously the\nmodel that is developed should not be tied to any single display type. There are also a plethora of new\ndisplay technologies coming out. The venerable CRT will still be around for many years, the LCD is found\non laptop computers and may be on our walls if HDTV takes off, color printers are coming into the\nhome, and there are many other new display technologies besides.Two difficulties arise with these new 200\ntechnologies. First, the research effort to develop good images on CRTs and LCDs were very expensive\nand it would be nice if what has been learned from one technology could be applied to\nanother. Secondly, the image reproduced on different displays can look very different, especially the\ncolors. Colors will change and some times so dramatically that we would describe it as a different color\non different displays. A good general model of visual system display interaction would allow new\ntechnologies to benefit from previous research and to develop images that have the same color from\nscreen to screen and screen to printer.\nWhereas studies of sensation and perception comprise a substantial portion of the field of human\nfactors, studies of sensory and perceptual function have also recently made important contributions to\nthe field of neuropsychology. This work has helped us to better understand and characterize a diverse\ngroup of neuropathologies and neurodegenerative disorders.\nNeuropsychology\nThe field of neuropsychology examines the relationship between central nervous system function and\nbehavior, often in cases of pathology. Scientists have long speculated on the links between cortical\nfunction and impaired behavior, and in the past have relied on studies of gross brain abnormality (e.g.,\nthe case of Phineas Gage) in order to gain insight into this relationship. Studies of specific visual and\nauditory processes now contribute considerably to our understanding of diseases and disorders that\ninvolve central nervous system pathology. These disorders include dyslexia, mental retardation,\nschizophrenia, and autism, as well as progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u00eds\ndisease, Parkinson\u00eds disease, and multiple sclerosis.\nOne challenge confronting researchers in these areas is that many disorders show multiple behavioral\nimpairments. Most neurological disorders have a characteristic profile of spared and impaired\nbehavioral abilities: some behaviors are relatively unaffected; others may be profoundly affected. For\nmany syndromes, scientists still seek to identify the range of different behaviors that show impairments,\nthe relative magnitude of these impairments, and the cortical and subcortical areas of the brain that\nmay be affected.\nWithout the answers to the questions above science cannot begin to understand and explain these\ndisabilities. Obviously there is a great interest to society, as well. If we know how and to what extent\ndifferent behaviors are affected there may be ways to help compensate or reduce the impact of an\nimpairment. Perhaps much the same way large-print books help the visually impaired. Also, we may\ndiscover that specialized training may be able to reduce or eliminate some perceptual\nimpairments. There is evidence that suggests that this may be true with dyslexia (Merzenich et al.,\n1996).\nSensory psychologists have contributed greatly to our understanding of these disorders. Because such a\nlarge proportion of cerebral cortex is devoted to processing sensory information, studies of sensation\nand perception offer a \u00ecwindow\u00ee into the brain. The information gathered from these studies helps\nidentify specific sensory or perceptual impairments, helps infer the cortical locations of the\nimpairments, and helps move us towards thorough causal explanations. As examples, we consider the\ncases of developmental dyslexia and Alzheimer\u00eds disease.\nDyslexia. Dyslexia refers to a broad family of impairments. Generally speaking, dyslexia is a term used to\ndefine a severe learning problem that is unrelated to intellectual ability, emotional disturbance, gross\nsensory or physical handicaps, sociocultural status, or insufficient schooling. The most common type of\ndyslexa, specific reading disability (SRD) involves difficulties in learning to read and write. At present we 201\nlack clear agreement about the nature of dyslexia, including its causes and symptomology. In fact, a\nminority of investigators even propose that dyslexia simply represents the lowest portion of the normal\ndistribution of these abilities in the general population, rather than a distinctive disorder (Shaywitz,\nEscobar, Shaywitz, Fletcher, & Makuch, 1992).\nHowever, most researchers agree that dyslexia probably results from abnormal\nneurodevelopment. Psychophysical studies suggest problems that are neural in origin as do anatomical\nstudies of brain structure and physiological studies of neural activity. Stein and Walsh (1997) provide a\nsuccinct and recent review.\nSRD is a reading impairment and children diagnosed with SRD are impaired in their abilities to\nauditorially distinguish the small differences among phonemes, the smallest units of speech (Brunswick\n& Rippon, 1994; Merzenich et al., 1996). Other verbal skills such as the rapid naming of objects and the\nability to break words down into smaller segments (i.e., cowboy to \u00eccow\u00ee and \u00ecboy\u00ee) are also impaired\n(Eden, Stein, Wood, & Wood; 1995).\nA recent, systematic study of the nature of phonological processing in dyslexia was conducted by\nShaywitz et al. (1998). Shaywitz et al. (1998) required dyslexic readers and control participants to\nperform a series of tasks, some of which required extensive phonological processing and others that\nrequired very little. While the participants engaged in these tasks, Shaywitz et al. used a brain imaging\ntechnique called fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure and map the pattern of\nneural activity in cerebral cortex. Shaywitz et al. observed what they refer to as a \u00ecneural signature\u00ee of\ndyslexia: A pattern of neural overactivation in some areas of cortex and underactivation in others. Some\nof the affected areas include traditional language areas and traditional visual ones. The authors\ninterpret their findings as evidence that dyslexia is primarily a phonological impairment, and one that\nmay involve a functional disruption of the mapping of the visual image (the printed words) to phonology\nduring reading. These findings and this theory of dyslexia explain a large set of the research findings in\nthis area and may describe the most proximal cause of SRD.\nThere is considerable evidence that children with SRD exhibit a set of visual perceptual problems that\nprecede this stage, however, and researchers are working to characterize their relationship to SRD.\nLovegrove, Garzia, & Nicholson (1990) provide a good discussion of the early work in this area. A large\nliterature now documents impairments in motion perception (Cornelissen, Richardson, Mason, Fowler,\n& Stein, 1995; Eden et al., 1996) contrast sensitivity (Borsting et al., 1996; Cornelissen et al.,\n1995; Evans, Drasdo, & Richards, 1994), flicker sensitivity (Evans et al., 1994), as well as other tasks that\npreferentially involve the magnocellular pathway (Edwards, Hogben, Clark, & Pratt, 1996). Further\nsupport for visual perceptual correlates of SRD comes from a recent study revealing a correlation\nbetween motion detection thresholds and word reading performance in children without SRD\n(Cornelissen, Hansen, Hutton, Evangelinou, & Stein, 1998).\nAnatomical and physiological abnormalities in the brain are associated with these behavioral\nabnormalities. In individuals with dyslexia the magnocellular layers of the LGN have been reported to be\ndisordered and the cells themselves much smaller than normal (Livingston, Rosen, Drislane, &\nGalaburda, 1991). Eden et al. (1996) used fMRI to reveal abnormal neural activity during visual motion\nprocessing in adults with dyslexia.\nIn an attempt to explain the range of perceptual and anatomical impairments that are associated with\nSRD, investigators have recently suggested that dyslexia may be linked to a general sensory temporal\nprocessing impairment (Farmer & Klein, 1995; Stein & Walsh, 1997). That is, individuals with SRD have 202\ndifficulty in processing sensory information that is brief or that changes rapidly over time. Studies of\nvisual perceptual abilities of children with SRD would be consistent with this explanation, as well as\nstudies that show that children with SRD have difficulties with some non-verbal auditory perceptual\ntasks as well as verbal ones (Tallal, 1980).\nAgain, the role that psychological research will play in understanding SRD will be large. Psychological\nresearch will help identify the cause(s) of SRD by helping to detail all the behaviors that are affected. A\nthorough description of SRD is very helpful because it permits researchers to eliminate alternative\nexplanations of dyslexia that cannot explain the profile of impairments. Psychological research may also\nhelp find ways to compensate of help minimize the affect of the impairment, for example, with\nspecialized training.Merzenich et al. (1996) report that children with learning disability can improve their\nabilities to perceive speech and nonspeech auditory stimuli with relatively little (8 to 16 hours) training.\nSensory psychologists have typically investigated these impairments in contrast sensitivity using\nspecialized stimuli (e.g. sine wave gratings). Several undergraduate students working in one of our\nlaboratories decided to investigate how well children with SRD would perform with more real-world\nstimuli, for example a visual acuity chart made up of high and low contrast letters. These students used\na computer program designed in-house to test a group of children with and without dyslexia on their\nabilities to read low and high contrast Tumbling-E's. The Figures below show representations of the\nstimuli used. 203\nFigure 19. The panel on the left shows E's that are black on a white background-they\nhave high luminance contrast. The panel on the right shows E's that are gray on a white background-\nthey have low luminance contrast. [Figure 19 description]\nThe student's hypothesis, based on reports in the literature, was that the children with SRD would\nperform no differently than the children without SRD on the high-contrast E's but have difficulty in\ncorrectly identifying the low-contrast E's. The data collected are shown in the Figures below. 204\nFigure 20. Each graph shows proportion correct for the different size E's, shown as the Snellen acuity\nequivalent (the way your optometrist describes the size of the letters). The panel on the left shows the\ndata for both groups of children when the E's were high contrast; the right panel for the low contrast\nstimuli. [Figure 20 description]\nNotice that there was no difference in performance between groups when the letter contrast was\nhigh. Both groups of children could see the large to small E's equally well. In the right panel, however,\nyou can see that when the contrast between the letters and the background was reduced the\nperformance for the children with dyslexia was affected to a much larger extent. Our students had\ndemonstrated that the effects of reduced contrast apply to the critical stimuli present in reading:\nindividual letters (Ballew, Brooks, & Annacelli, 2001). More importantly, special stimuli and conditions\nwere not required to observe the effects (see also Woods & Oross, 1998).\nStudies of sensation and perception have also contributed to our understanding of progressive\nneurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\u00eds disease.\nAlzheimer\u00eds Disease. Alzheimer\u00eds disease is characterized by neuropathology (neurofibrillary tangles and\namyloid plaques in cerebral cortex) and behavioral impairment, primarily progressive cognitive\ndecline. To the general public, Alzheimer\u00eds disease is a \u00ecmemory disorder.\u00ee Alzheimer\u00eds disease involves\nmemory impairments, but it involves other behavioral deficits as well. In fact, according to the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV, 1994) a\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer\u00eds disease (Dementia of the Alzheimer\u00eds type) requires the presence of other non-\nmemory related symptoms.\nEarly work suggested that the sensory systems and general perceptual abilities were spared in\nAlzheimer\u00eds disease. The initial observation that primary visual cortex was relatively free of the plaques\nand tangles that are characteristic of the disease and because visual acuity in Alzheimer\u00eds patients was\nnot significantly different from that typically observed in normal aging supported this\nconclusion. Science, in its thoroughness, continued to investigate and assess other cognitive and\nnoncognitive behaviors. As research in the area continued and specific perceptual skills were assessed,\nhowever, several visual and perceptual changes associated with Alzheimer\u00eds disease were revealed. 205\nIn addition to visual changes that are a consequence of normal aging, Alzheimer\u00eds disease is now\nassociated with ganglion cell death in the retina (Blanks, Hinton, Sadun, & Miller; 1989), a substantial\ndegeneration of optic nerve fibers (Hinton, Sadun, Blanks, & Miller, 1986), and cell loss in primary visual\ncortex (Hof & Morrison, 1990).\nThe association of visual perceptual problems with Alzheimer\u00eds disease is now well\ndocumented. Relative to age-matched controls, individuals with Alzheimer\u00eds disease have been reported\nto have impairments in contrast sensitivity (Bassi, Solomon, & Young, 1993; Gilmore & Whitehouse,\n1995), blue-yellow color discrimination (Cronin-Golomb, Suguira, Corkin, & Growdon, 1993), depth\nperception (Mittenburg, Malloy, Petrick, & Knee, 1993) and motion perception (Gilmore, Wenk, Naylor,\n& Koss, 1994). The extent of the visual problems in Alzheimer\u00eds disease has led many investigators to\nconsider the visual sequelae one of the hallmarks of the disease. In fact, some investigators have\nreported that Alzheimer\u00eds disease may have its origin in the visual sensory pathways (Gilmore &\nWhitehouse, 1995).\nImportantly, research in visual perception may have helped identify a set of new diagnostic tools. There\nis evidence that in Alzheimer\u00eds disease the perceptual impairments may present before many of the\ncognitive impairments. Some individuals with Alzheimer\u00eds disease report consulting their optometrist or\nophthalmologist concerning a vision problem before memory or cognitive impairments became evident\n(Kiyosawa et al., 1989). Researchers are currently investigating the extent to which visual perceptual\ntests may be used clinically to help identify Alzheimer\u00eds disease and other progressive neuropathologies\nin their earliest stages.\nFuture Directions in Sensation and Perception\nAs discussed early in this chapter, recent discoveries in the behavioral neurosciences have greatly\naffected research in sensation and perception. An appreciation of the extent to which sensory systems\nprocess information in parallel required us to reconceptualize how sensory systems build our perceptual\nexperiences. The advances in the behavioral neurosciences have led a substantial number of researchers\nto direct the focus of their research to explaining perception at this level of analysis. Today, research in\nsensation and perception often involves using psychophysical data to make inferences regarding the\nunderlying neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. This theoretical approach to understanding sensation\nand perception, called neuroreductionism, has enjoyed great success. Many of the simpler perceptual\nphenomena can be explained by (or related to) the structure or function of underlying neural structures.\nWe have every reason to believe that this trend will continue and that other equally stunning\ndiscoveries are just around the corner. However, we need to recognize that in the future the\nneuroreductionist approach may result in diminished returns. Many of the perceptual phenomena that\nare amenable to simpler neuroreductionistic explanations have been described. Also, the extent to\nwhich this approach can provide similar and satisfactory explanations of higher-level perceptual\nphenomena remains to be demonstrated.\nAdditionally, as a theoretical approach to understanding perception, neuroreductionism has its share of\ndetractors. William Uttal (1998), in his book Toward a new behaviorism: The case against perceptual\nreductionism, argues that researchers in sensation and perception should resist the very seductive\nenterprise of trying to link psychophysical data to specific underlying neural mechanisms. One of the\ntheoretical problems associated with this approach, according to Uttal, is that neural events are not\nidentical to mental events. Uttal calls this \u00ecpsychoneural equivalence,\u00ee and he argues that it will always\nbe difficult, if not impossible, to satisfactorily relate the two. He further adds that psychologists should\nnot feel compelled to attempt it. Additionally, Uttal argues that \u00ec\u00d6if perceptual psychology is to survive, 206\nand not be inappropriately absorbed into the neural or computational sciences in the next millennium, it\nwill have to return to its behaviorist, positivist roots\u00ee (p. xii).\nAlthough Uttal\u00eds (1998) argument is a compelling one, this large a shift in theoretical approach is\nunlikely. First, the neuroreductionist approach continues to provide us with valuable insights into\nsensory mechanisms. Second, the advent of superior brain imaging techniques, like the fMRI, have\nopened new avenues for researchers to visualize perception\u00eds neurological substrates in the awake,\nbehaving human.\nHowever, despite today\u00eds neuroreductionist leanings, we still recognize that our individual perceptions\nare best described as gestalts, where the whole is far more than the sum of the anatomical or\nphysiological parts. Also, many psychologists would agree that an understanding of these higher-order,\nemergent properties will do more to enhance our understanding of human sensation and perception\nthan will neuroreductionist explanations involving the activity in small groups of neurons. Psychophysics,\nthe set of methodological tools that sensory psychologists possess, is ideally suited to investigate\nperception at this level of analysis. Perhaps the unique promise of sensory psychology, relative to the\nother perceptual sciences, is that it does provide explanations of behavior at the molar rather than the\nmolecular level. In a sense, this may be our \u00ecscientific niche.\u00ee\nWe believe, then, that some of the most dramatic and important contributions that psychology will\nmake in the near future will be in our understanding of higher-level perceptual mechanisms. We will see\nmore studies of phenomenology, perception and action, and sensory integration. A good example of\none of the intriguing research techniques and issues on the horizon for perceptual psychology is virtual\nreality (VR).\nVirtual Reality\nVR is the development of artificial environments that can be navigated directly. They can be the\nrelatively simple or very complex. They fall into two general categories: window on the world and\nimmersion. In window on the world, the user views the environment as from a window into the\nworld. The monitor screen is the window and the information on the screen provides the visual\ninformation about this world. This is the type of VR involved in most video games and a very primitive\nversion of this type of VR is illustrated in Figure 21. The more compelling and interesting type of VR\noccurs when the person is immersed in the environment. This type of VR uses helmet-mounted displays\nto generate the visual information, often has an integrated sound system, and occasionally provides\ntactile feedback. It is this latter type of VR that holds the most interest, but research and study is\nproceeding on both types of VR. 207\nFigure 21. Here is a very primitive virtual environment of the window on the world type. Use the arrows\nto navigate to the right and the left and observe the movement of the two objects in the display. [Figure\n21 description]\nVR is both a research technique, because of its ability to provide sensory input from multiple sensory\nsystems in a controlled manner, and a research area because it is also an application where sensory\nknowledge will be fundamental for success. Some examples of the application of VR that are relevant to\npsychology have been in clinical psychology (Huang, Himle, & Alessi, 2000; Jang, Ku, Shin, Choi, & Kim ,\n2000; Roessier, Mueller-Spahn, Baehrer, & Bullinger, 2000), neuropsychological evaluation (Kesztyues et\nal., 2000), memory research (Gamberini, 2000), and education and training (Cromby, Standen, & Brown,\n1996; Mohler, 2000).\nOne of the research advantages of the most advanced VR systems is that it can provide controlled inputs\nto the visual, auditory and tactile systems. To date, the vast majority of studies in sensation and\nperception have primarily investigated the senses separately.However, many experiences are based\nupon inputs from multiple sensory systems. For example, hearing and seeing a bat hit a ball. Consider\nhow jarring it is to sit so far away that the sound and the sight are not integrated.\nThe study of body orientation, for example, focuses on a fundamentally integrated sensory system. A\nseries of recent studies suggest that visual information alone may be sufficient for determining whole-\nbody translation and linear movement in the virtual environment. However, feedback from the tactile\nsystems may be needed for accurate determination of rotation (Chance & Loomis, 1987; Richardson,\nHegarty, & Montello, 1997).\nRichardson et al. (1997) found that going around a staircase in a virtual building leads to larger errors in\ndetermining their location relative to their starting point than either learning the environment from\nmaps or actually moving through the real version of the environment. Chance and Loomis (1987) studied\nperception of direction in individuals moving in virtual environments, with or without tactile\nfeedback. Chance and Loomis found that if a person actually rotates but translates via the virtual\nenvironment, thus receiving the tactile input from the rotation, they kept their sense of direction far\nbetter. We know that visual input is suppressed during saccadic eye movements, which accompany body 208\nrotations. Perhaps the orienting system, not expecting good visual input during physical rotation, has\ndeveloped a tendency to rely more on tactile input (Krantz & White, 1989; Volkmann, 1986) . The need\nto rely on tactile input may result from the fact that during the illusion of rotation in a VR environment,\nthe vestibular system is not activated, an illustration of the importance of understanding the integration\nof different sensory systems (Cohn, Dizio, & Lackner, 2000). The VR environment is especially suited to\nstudying multi-sensory and sensory-motor integration.\nSensory research is also proving to be helpful to engineers working on VR systems. In a recent paper,\nCutting (1997) gives a review of the visual information needed for VR applications, including how space\nperception and the use of depth cues can assist VR engineers in developing appropriate visual inputs. An\nimportant feature of Cutting\u00eds work is his quantitative approach to VR. Just as it was necessary to\ndevelop equations for color matching to be used in monitors and printing, so it will be necessary to\nprovide quantitative functions for other visual functions before they can be applied to VR. Thus,\nresearch in sensation and perception may well take the form of taking well-understood phenomena and\ndeveloping quantitative models for application. This research may also indicate new visual functions that\nneed to be explored. One possible issue is the location of the center of projection relative to the persons\neye height. Dixon, Wraga, Proffitt, & Williams (2000) found that the relationship between a subjects eye\nheight and the center of projection profoundly affected the perception of size.\nAnother interesting question related to VR that is both a research question and an application issue is\nthe difference between the two forms of VR. The experience of VR in the immersion techniques is far\nmore immediate than the window on the world. What are the features that makes this so? One\ndifference is that the field of view tends to be far more restricted in the window on the world (Dichgans\n& Brandt, 1978) though Dixon et al. (2000) found that an immersion technique with a restricted field of\nview had as strong a relationship between eye height and perceived size as did a full immersion\ntechnique. The window on the world condition in the same paper showed now effect of the relationship\nbetween eye height and center of projects. These results suggest that the difference between the two\nforms of VR is more than just a difference between the size of the field of view. All in all, VR is a fruitful\nfield for psychological research into sensation and perception and vice versa. In fact it appears that the\ndevelopment of VR and the use of VR as a research tool in sensation and perception may be tightly\nintertwined.\nSummary\nToday, research in sensation and perception continues to identify interesting and important perceptual\nphenomena that contribute to our understanding of sensory system structure and function, the nature\nof perceptual processes, and the human mind. The discovery of additional cone photoreceptor types in\nthe retina is one recent example of a contribution to our fundamental understanding of the visual\nsystem. Studies of sensation and perception have also made important contributions to applied fields\nsuch as human factors and neuropsychology. In the case of human factors, research in sensation and\nperception helped in the design of machines that better fit human capabilities. In the case of\nneuropsychology, this research contributed to our understanding of a variety of neuropathological\ndisorders and has shown promise as a tool for early identification. The future research in sensation and\nperception will continue to involve studies of fundamental sensory processes as well as complex\nperceptual mechanisms. One future area of research that shows particular promise is the study of\nintegrated perceptual experiences such as VR.\nReferences 209\nAlpern, M., & Wake, T. (1977).

Berk\nIllinois State University\nDuring moments of reflection about our own lives and those of people we know well, virtually all of us\nponder questions that are of great interest to researchers of human development. Perhaps you have\nwondered about one or more of the following:\n\u2022 What determines the attributes we share with our parents and siblings and those that make\neach of us unique--in physical traits, mental capacities, interests, and behaviors?\n\u2022 What is the infant and young child's understanding of the world like, and how does it change\nover time?\n\u2022 Why do some of us retain the temperamental styles that characterized us as children (such as\nshyness, sociability, excitability, or high activity), whereas others change in essential ways?\n\u2022 How do homes, schools, neighborhoods, and contemporary realities--employed mothers, day\ncare, divorce, smaller families, and new technologies--contribute to our characteristics and\nskills?\nHuman development is a field of study devoted to understanding constancy and change throughout the\nlifespan. Its scientific roots date back to fledgling observational and interview studies of children and\nadolescents in the early part of the twentieth century. In the beginning, description--charting age-\nrelated milestones, such as when a child first walked, spoke in sentences, formed a best friendship, and\nreached puberty--was the principal activity of American developmentalists (see, for example,\nMurchison, 1933). Little attention was accorded to process--the how and why of human change.\nFollowing World War II, the field came into its own. Although always a melting pot of interdisciplinary\ncontributions, by the 1960s human development achieved the status of a distinct subdivision within\npsychology. Empirical work flourished, becoming more sophisticated in methodology and focusing more\ndirectly on explanation. Grand theories (behaviorist views of learning, the psychoanalytic approach to\npersonality development, and Piaget's theory of cognitive development) held sway (Cairns, 1983, 1998).\nEach was closely tied to a specific domain, or aspect, of human functioning. Together, the grand theories\nbrought tension and debate to the field, offering powerfully opposing perspectives on the course and\nprocesses of change. A passive child continuously shaped by environmental inputs was pitted against an\nactive, sense-making being undergoing a series of stagewise shifts rooted in human biology.\nInvestigators of the mid-century phase had become increasingly sensitive to social and applied issues.\nBesides traditional topics of enduring interest, such as perception, intelligence, language, personality,\nand morality, they turned to questions of burning practical concern, such as the impact of poverty, child\nabuse and neglect, the rising divorce rate, maternal employment and day care, and learning problems in\nschool. In addition to theoretical advances, the field had aligned itself more closely with the goal of\nimproving children's conditions of life.\nThis broad brush-stroke image of the emergence of developmental psychology is chronicled in detail in\nthe Handbook of Child Psychology, a compendium of the field that has been published in successive\neditions at 9- to 16-year intervals since the 1930s. The Handbook's fourth edition appeared in 1983; the\nfifth in 1998. A comparison of these most recent volumes with the preceding, 1970 edition reveals a 222\nperiod of unprecedented expansion and change. The most obvious shift is that by the early 1980s, the\ngrand theories that had dominated mid-century research were being seriously questioned. In their place\nhad sprouted a variety of alternative perspectives, including ethology, information processing, social\ncognition, behavioral genetics, and cultural approaches. These views were no longer as one-sided in\nfocusing on a single domain of functioning (e.g., social behavior, personality, or cognition). They were\nalso less polarized in their view of the roles of biology and environment (Dixon & Lerner, 1992; Lerner,\n1998). The concerns of researchers had also broadened considerably, generating much more research\non such topics as play, peer relations, the self-system, aggression, developmental psychopathology, and\nthe school as a context for development (Mussen, 1983).\nThe Field Today\nThe 1980s have been characterized as a transitional phase in developmental psychologytone in which\n\"[no theoretical perspective] was on center stage\" (Damon, 1998, p. xv). As the most\nrecent Handbook reveals, a fragmented field is giving way to new, more powerful theoretical models\ninvolving multiple interacting variables at several levels of influence--biological, psychological, proximal\nenvironmental (family, child-care center, school, neighborhood), and distal environmental (community,\nsociety, culture, historical) (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998; Fischer & Bidell, 1998; Lerner, 1998).\nAlthough greater in number than they once were, a core of theories is again leading contemporary\nresearch. These include ecological-systems, lifespan, and transactional (person/context) approaches;\nbehavioral genetics views addressing the joint operation of nature and nurture; neo-Piagetian models\nencompassing neurological, information-processing, and task-specific influences on cognitive change;\nand Vygotskian sociocultural views focusing on social interaction and culture as major forces in\npsychological development (Damon, 1998).\nMoreover, research summarized in the 1998 Handbook attests to growing interest in both basic\npsychological dimensions, such as temperament and emotion, and in higher-order, metacognitive\nprocesses, including children's knowledge of their own and others' thoughts, feelings, and beliefs and\ncapacity to monitor and regulate their own cognitive and social behavior. The 1998 Handbook is also the\nfirst to devote an entire volume to child psychology in practice--a clear indication of burgeoning efforts\nto use research as the basis for successful caregiving, educational, and clinical interventions (Sigel &\nRenninger, 1998).\nAlthough it is impossible to portray comprehensively all current forces in the field, the following are vital\ndominating and interrelated trends:\n\u2022 Strengthening connections with other subfields of psychology and other disciplines. The\ncontemporary move toward a systems perspective on development--one in which thinking,\nfeeling, and acting are viewed as an integrated whole and affected by a wide array of factors in\nbiology, context, and culture--has motivated developmental researchers to strengthen their\nlinks with other fields of psychology and with other disciplines. Currently, neuropsychology,\nsocial psychology, educational psychology, health psychology, clinical psychology, biology,\npediatrics, sociology, anthropology, and other fields contribute to and benefit from research\nagendas in developmental psychology. The lessons gleaned have been a major impetus for the\nthree trends that follow.\n\u2022 An emphasis on multiple pathways of change. Today, the field of developmental psychology\nrecognizes that because children have similar brains and bodies and live in stimulating\nenvironments, certain broad outlines of development apply to many youngsters. At the same\ntime, biological makeup, everyday tasks, the people who support children in mastery of those 223\ntasks, and the quality of children's experiences vary greatly, leading to wide individual\ndifferences in specific skills. Even when children master the same skills, such as walking, talking,\nor adding and subtracting, they often do so in unique ways. Consequently, an increasing number\nof investigators are choosing ecological, dynamic systems, and sociocultural perspectives\nthrough which to frame their research in hopes of accounting for the enormous diversity in\ndevelopment (Bronfenbrenner, 1995, 1998; Rogoff, 1990, 1998; Thelen & Smith, 1994, 1998;\nVan der Veer & Valsiner, 1991).\nA recent revival of longitudinal research has been a powerful force in raising the field's\nconsciousness of diversity in development. Although few in number, longitudinal studies\noccurred early in the history of the field--in the 1920s and 1930s. The most notable began with a\nfocus on child and adolescent development but were extended over participants' lifetimes\n(Jones, 1971; Kagan & Moss, 1962; Terman & Oden, 1959). Tracking of individual trajectories of\nchange revealed unique routes to maturity and both stability and instability in physical health,\nintelligence, and social and personality functioning.\nFor example, researchers discovered that the majority of children show substantial IQ\nfluctuations over childhood and adolescence--in most cases, 10 to 20 points, and sometimes\nmuch more (McCall, 1993). Gainers tended to be independent and competitive about doing well\nin school and had parents who were highly interested in their intellectual accomplishments,\napplied greater pressure to succeed, and used rational, democratic discipline. Decliners tended\nto have parents who made little effort to stimulate them and who showed extremes in child\nrearing, using either very severe or very lax discipline (McCall, Appelbaum, & Hogarty, 1973;\nSontag, Baker, & Nelson, 1958). From the start, longitudinal work challenged genetic\ndeterminism and illuminated complex biological and environmental contributions to\ndevelopment (Caspi, Elder, & Herbener, 1990; Friedman, Tucker, et al., 1995). It also provided\npart of the foundation for the contemporary emphasis on studying development throughout the\nlifespan.\nInherent in the current burst of longitudinal studies--both short-term and spanning many years--\nis the recognition that development can only be fully understood by directly examining its\ntemporal context. As the only method that focuses on relationships between early and later\nevents and behaviors, the longitudinal approach is particularly suited to highlighting processes\nof change. Furthermore, cohort effects (the impact of cultural-historical conditions on\ndevelopment), previously regarded as a contaminant in longitudinal research, are now a target\nof investigation in their own right. For example, the Great Depression of the early 1930s had a\nprofound impact on development. It introduced stresses into parent-child relations, affected\nchildren's emotional adjustment and school performance, modified adolescents' educational\naspirations and occupational choices, and prompted an earlier age of marriage in young\nadulthood (Elder, 1974; Elder, Caspi, & Van Nguyen, 1986; Elder, Liker, & Cross, 1984). The field\nhas become more conscious that the environment is not restricted to events in the immediate\nsituation. Instead, cultural and historical systems at more distal levels affect immediate\ncontexts, the person's interpretation of those contexts, and therefore person-environment\ninteraction (Magnusson & Stattin, 1998; Shweder et al., 1998).\n\u2022 More sophisticated conceptions of the joint influence of biology and environment.\nContemporary work on biology and development is based on complex frameworks that posit\ninterconnected roles for hereditary/constitutional and environmental factors. The current\nliterature is replete with references to range of reaction; genetic-environmental correlation; 224\nshared and nonshared environmental influences; experientially-induced synaptic growth;\ndynamic systems in which biology and environment join forces to induce development; co-\nconstruction of psychological structures by child and expert partner; and evolutionary\nperspectives on attachment, cognition, and social behavior. As these ideas reveal, the field has\nturned away from biological determinism, a flawed perspective with devastating psychological,\nsocial, and policy consequences (Eisenberg, 1998). In its place is the realization that biological\nand environmental factors interact in intricate ways and cannot be separated in a simple\nmanner.\nAt present, biological dispositions are viewed as emerging in and modified by diverse social\ncontexts. Even in domains where biological evidence is rapidly accumulatingtfor example, the\ngrowing literature on neurological and hormonal correlates of temperament--research findings\nrepeatedly underscore that biology always shares power with experience (Kagan, 1998). To cite\njust two examples, when an extremely shy, inhibited baby is exposed to appropriately\nsupportive caregiving, the physiological correlates of inhibition are reduced (Gunnar et al.,\n1996). Similarly, among adopted children at genetic risk for antisocial behavior (it was prevalent\nin their biological families), the quality of adoptive parents' support predicts whether or not they\nactually develop aggressive, antisocial personalities (Cadoret et al., 1995).\nAs these illustrations reveal, contemporary research is no longer as heavily concerned with\nwhether and to what extent heredity is involved in a variety of human attributes. Instead,\ninvestigators have turned their energies toward uncovering the biological mechanisms that\nbridge the gap between genes and behavior and the types of parenting and teaching strategies\nthat might modify those factors and, thereby, help children with specific temperaments,\npersonalities, and intellectual strengths and weaknesses develop at their best. Consider the\nfollowing research questions: What are the physiological correlates of shyness, in terms of heart\nrate patterns, blood hormone concentrations, and brain-wave activity? Can child-rearing\npractices modify these responses and the chances that a shy baby will become a fearful,\ninhibited child? (See Kagan, 1998; Park et al., 1997; Rubin et al., 1997). How effective is\neducational, nutritional, and health intervention for children exposed to biological and social\nrisks, such as poor prenatal care, birth complications, and poverty-stricken home environments?\nHow early must such intervention begin, how long must it be sustained, and how intensive must\nit be to have a long-term impact on development? (See, for example, Ramey & Ramey, 1998.)\n\u2022 A stronger interface between theory-driven research and pressing practical concerns. The field\nof developmental psychology has intensified its interest in generating research findings that can\nbe applied to real-life issues in real-life situations--homes, schools, mental health clinics,\nhospitals, juvenile courts, workplaces, and any other setting that affects the health and welfare\nof the developing person. Blending scientific research with practice has been, and continues to\nbe, a formidable challenge. Because research done in the traditional way--in laboratories and\nunder highly controlled conditions--fails to mirror conditions of everyday life, it cannot offer\nprescriptions for what practitioners should do; it can only be suggestive. Moreover, the majority\nof developmental research is not written to be accessible or useful to practitioners--in large\nmeasure because most researchers are not engaged in practice and have little direct\ninvolvement with practitioners.\nNevertheless, the field is gradually doing a better job of bridging the gap between science and\napplication. In some instances, researchers have created collaborative partnerships with\npractitioners in designing and carrying out research. These efforts have not only yielded 225\ninformation of greater usefulness, but have uncovered obstacles that must be surmounted for\nknowledge to be applied in real life. In pediatrics, for example, making childhood immunizations\nfree and accessible is not sufficient to ensure that every child will be fully vaccinated. Daily\nstressors that prevent parents from taking their child to a clinic along with parental\nmisconceptions--that an immunization itself might lead to illness--need to be overcome\n(Abbotts & Osborne, 1993). In education, teachers cognizant of research on the importance of\nplay in young children's development face difficulties in applying their insights because of\nexternal pressures for curriculum coverage. In addition, many adhere to the belief that they\nshould not intervene in play, despite their own observations that children often encounter\ncognitive and social challenges while playing that can only be resolved with adult support\n(Bennett, Wood, & Rogers, 1997).\nEfforts to integrate research with practice have led to a breed of professionals called \"scientist\npractitioners\"--educators, practicing psychologists, and physicians trained to engage in both\nendeavors. In addition, new interdisciplinary fields have arisen during the past two decades,\neach of which aims to reduce the sharp division that formerly existed between basic and applied\nresearch. The most influential of these fields is developmental psychopathology, which\naddresses the relationship between normal development and disturbances in psychological\nfunctioning (see Bearison, 1998, for another exampletpediatric psychology).\nIn bridging developmental and clinical psychology, the field of developmental psychopathology\nis demonstrating that we can learn much about normal development by studying pathology,\nsince investigations of brain damage, mental disorder, and stress-ridden environments enable\nscientists to isolate factors that foster adaptation not readily apparent in well-functioning\nindividuals (Cicchetti & Cohen, 1995; Overton & Horowitz, 1991). Similarly, much can be learned\nabout pathology by examining normal development. In this vein, researchers have been\nespecially interested in individuals who are resilient, or functioning well despite biological or\nenvironmental risks. Comparisons of their life courses with those of individuals displaying\npsychological dysfunction have uncovered personal and social factors that protect against\nadversity, for example, an easy going, sociable disposition; a warm parental relationship; high\nintellectual ability, which increases that chances of rewarding experiences in school; and social\nsupports outside the immediate family (Cicchetti, 1993; Cicchetti & Toth, 1998). To achieve\nthese understandings, longitudinal research has become the hallmark of developmental\npsychopathology (see, for example, Garmezy, 1993; Rutter, 1987; Moffitt et al., 1996; Werner &\nSmith, 1992).\nResearcher-practitioner alliances have done much to strengthen the trends mentioned earlier in\nthis chapter. Practitioners cannot make use of narrowly focused research; they require an\nunderstanding of the whole individual--the way physical, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndevelopment are interwoven. Moreover, the interdisciplinary perspective of developmental\npsychopathology has enhanced our appreciation of diversity in development--that maintenance\nand breakdown of functioning can occur in a great many ways. Finally, conceptions of\ndevelopment emerging from this new field acknowledge human development in its full subtlety,\nas due to complex transactions between biological and environmental forces.\nAs developmental researchers reach out to applied fields that touch their own, they are making\nresearch more accessible, drawing together formerly fragmented topics of study, conducting\nmore investigations in real-life settings and, thereby, expanding their appreciation of contextual 226\ninfluences on development. They realize more firmly that \"understanding can come from many\nsources: research in the laboratory, research in the field, practice in the consulting room,\nwatching children in the classroom, and taking a step back and reflecting on all [they] see\" (Sigel,\n1998, p. 1131). The synergy arising between developmental researchers and consumers of their\nwork is yielding dual benefitstfor developmental theory and for interventions and services\ndirected at preventing maladaptive outcomes and improving conditions of life.\nVygotsky's Sociocultural Theory and Contemporary Developmental Research\nSeveral themes addressed in the preceding section--the complex interconnection between biology and\nenvironment, multiple pathways of change, and the interface between theory and practice--have\npermeated my own research and that of others working within the same theoretical tradition. For the\npast decade and a half, my research group has addressed the origins, development, and functional\nsignificance of a fascinating but puzzling phenomenon: children's private speech, or speech to\nthemselves as they engage in problem solving, play, and other activities.\nI became captivated by private speech while carrying out classroom-observational research on the\neffects of school environments on children's cognitive and social development. Although at the time my\nresearch goals were focused on other phenomena, I could not help but notice that children talked to\nthemselves a great deal as they went about their daily activities. After spending several weeks in a\nspecial elementary school for children with severe learning and behavior problems, I came away with\nthe impression that certain children used private speech almost constantly while engaged in academic\nwork. My first investigations, along with the work of others, confirmed that depending on the situation,\nprivate speech accounts for 20 to 60 percent of the spoken language of preschool and school-age\nchildren (Berk, 1992). Its high rate of occurrence led me to ask: If children talk to themselves so often,\nwhat role does such language play in their psychological development?\nThe work of my research group has been guided by Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, a leading\nperspective in contemporary developmental psychology that regards uniquely human, higher forms of\nmental activity as originating in social and cultural experiences. Our studies have also been spurred by\napplied concerns. We are intensely interested in the role that private speech plays in learningtfor\nnormally developing children and children with serious difficulties with attention and regulation of\nbehavior. Our work is part of a much larger Vygotsky-inspired literature that is revolutionizing the field's\nview of the importance of social and cultural contexts for cognitive development, offering new insights\ninto the development of children with serious learning problems, and energizing a plethora of\ninnovative educational interventions and programs.\nEssentials of Vygotsky's Theory\nA major tenet of Vygotsky's theory is that people are products of their social and cultural worlds and\nthat to understand children's thinking, one must understand the social and cultural contexts in which\nchildren develop. Although Vygotsky's innovative sociocultural ideas date back to the 1920s and early\n1930s, they did not take hold in Western developmental psychology until recently for several reasons.\nFirst, Vygotsky's untimely death in 1934, at the age of 37, meant that he had little opportunity to\nintegrate his formulations into a tightly organized, well structured theory. In this sense, it is best to think\nof his work as a series of minitheories that embody a general approach that has since been extended\nand refined by many scholars. Second, in the mid-1930s, Vygotsky's writings were condemned in the\nSoviet Union due to Stalinist repression. Consequently, for almost 30 years they remained virtually\nunknown to Western scholars. Finally, when the first English translations of significant works by 227\nVygotsky were released in the 1960s and 1970s, interest had to wait for growing dissatisfaction with\nPiaget's theory, which dominated mid-twentieth century research on cognitive development.\nA Socially Formed Mind. Although Piaget and Vygotsky are often placed in opposition, they have\nimportant points of contact and compatibility (Cobb, 1994; Glassman, 1994; Tudge & Winteroff, 1993).\nEach derived theories with both natural (biological) and social dimensions. Piaget, however, stressed the\nnatural line of development--factors within the organism that lead to cognitive change. His view of the\nsocial line was considerably more restricted than that of Vygotsky. Interaction with adults, Piaget\n(1923/1926; 1928/1977) believed, is often ineffective in prompting cognitive change; he thought\nchildren tended to bend to adult authority without truly examining the adult's perspective. Instead,\nPiaget underscored the power of arguments with agemates, or coequals, in jarring children into realizing\nthat others hold viewpoints different from their own. Yet even though Piaget regarded peer\ndisagreements as a significant motivator of revisions in cognitive structures, social experience never\nbecame a major focus in his theory or research (Berk & Winsler, 1995; Rogoff, 1998). Nor did Piaget, in\npositing a universal sequence of stages, address the role of culture in cognitive development.\nBy the 1980s, increasing evidence of wide variability in children's developmental paths and progress led\nAmerican psychologists and educators to greet Vygotsky's emphasis on the social and cultural side of\nchildren's experiences with enthusiasm. For Vygotsky, the locus of development is not within the\nindividual brain or mind. Instead, it is socially situated--between people (Bakhtin, 1981; Wertsch, 1985;\nWertsch, Tulviste, & Hagstrom, 1993). Through social interaction, each society passes on to the next\ngeneration a set of higher mental functions--for example, attention, memory, and problem-solving\nstrategies--specially suited to carrying out that culture's practical activities. As more expert members of\nsociety (both adults and peers) assist children in mastering challenging tasks, their collaboration alters\nthe natural line of development, transforming basic mental capacities into culturally adaptive\ncompetencies (Vygotsky, 1930-1935/1978). Then new generations collectively transform these mental\nfunctions and practices, contributing to cultural-historical change (Scribner, 1985; Wertsch, 1985).\nRole of Language. According to Vygotsky, transfer of cognitive processes from the social to the individual\nplane of functioning is enabled by \"tools of the mind,\" or signs, that mediate relations between people.\nAlthough Vygotsky (1960/1980) noted a wide variety of culturally generated, symbolic tools, the tool of\nthe mind of preeminent importance in his theory is language, since it is our primary avenue of\ncommunicating with others and serves as the major means by which social experience is represented\npsychologically. Gradually, the child turns social speech toward the self and uses it to organize,\ntransform, and regulate his or her own thinking and behavior.\nVygotsky regarded private speech as the crucial bridge between the social and psychological worlds.\nThese self-directed utterances originate in and differentiate from social speech; they signify that the\nprocess of internalizing social experience is underway. As the child gains mastery over behavior, private\nspeech abbreviates and becomes less audible. Once cognitive operations become well practiced,\nchildren start to \"think words\" rather than saying them. Gradually private speech becomes silent, inner\nspeech--the conscious dialogues we hold with ourselves while thinking and acting in everyday situations.\nNevertheless, the need to engage in private speech never disappears. As people encounter unfamiliar or\ndemanding activities throughout the lifespan, private speech resurfaces as a tool for overcoming\nobstacles and acquiring new skills. Moreover, it continues to display the communicative properties and\nmark of the sociocultural settings in which it originated.\nAlthough Vygotsky viewed higher mental functions as internalized social processes, they are not the\nresult of children simply mimicking features of social interaction (Wertsch, 1985). Vygotsky's vision is 228\nvery different from traditional social learning views, which regard development as copied from external\nsources. Rather than a social-influence approach, Vygotsky's theory embodies a social-participation\nperspective in which children are active agents in their own development (Rogoff, 1998). Through\nshared endeavors, they join with others to create mental functions and alter those functions to fit their\nmomentary goals and circumstances. Because the term internalization has the unfortunate connotation\nof simple transmission of knowledge and skills, some Vygotskian scholars have suggested that other\nwords, such as \"appropriation\" or \"constructive transformation,\" be used to reflect Vygotsky's vision\n(Lawrence & Valsiner, 1993; Rogoff, Mistry, G\u00f6nc\u00fc, & Mosier, 1993; Stone, 1993).\nThe Zone of Proximal Development. Vygotsky (1978) termed the region of social to psychological\ntransfer of culturally adaptive competencies the zone of proximal development; it is probably his most\nwell-known idea. The zone of proximal development refers to a range of tasks that the child cannot yet\nmaster independently but can do with the guidance of adults or more skilled peers. It is the dynamic,\never-changing locus of collaboration where learning and development take place.\nThrough the zone of proximal development, Vygotsky posited that development results from children's\nparticipation in activities slightly beyond their competence. To maintain the zone, interaction\ncontinuously recalibrates to fit the child's changing competencies, interests, and goals and the expert\npartner's insights into what can best help the child move beyond the immediate task and situation to\nbecome a more competent member of his or her cultural community. In essence, the zone of proximal\ndevelopment is the \"crucible\" of sociocultural development (Cole, 1985).\nThe concept of the zone of proximal development has far-reaching implications. As we will see later, it\nhas sparked a growing body of research on qualities of adult-child and child-child interaction that\npromote cognitive development. It also suggests a revised approach to assessment. Indeed, Vygotsky\nfirst envisioned the zone of proximal development as an alternative to traditional intelligence and\nachievement testing and the view of development and education that emerges from use of such tests.\nInstead of measuring \"static,\" previously acquired abilities (what the child already knows or can do\nindependently), he suggested that what we should be measuring is the dynamic, future-oriented side of\nhuman cognition--what the child can do with the assistance of others and therefore has the potential to\nlearn.\nOn a larger scale, the zone of proximal development highlights the vital role of education in Vygotsky's\ntheory. Earlier I noted that for Piaget, development is largely internally controlled; what comes from\nwithin the child is most important for directing cognitive change. Education refines those capacities that\nemerge spontaneously from children's explorations of their surroundings. Vygotsky (1956), in contrast,\nargued that education leads, or elicits, development. It does so by involving children in activities suited\nto their potential development, thereby advancing their actual development.\nFurthermore, Vygotsky (1934/1986) noted that as education leads to new capacities, it helps children\nmove to a new level of understanding in which they become increasingly aware of their own mental life.\nThat is, as children integrate into their private speech the strategies gleaned through dialogues with\nexperts, they begin to engage in \"verbalized self-observation\" in which they think about those strategies\nand apply them in a more deliberate fashion. In sum, Vygotsky viewed education as a major contributor\nto children's metacognitionttheir growing consciousness and regulation of their own thought processes.\nEducation prompts a shift to a higher, more reflective level of cognitive activity.\nVygotsky-Inspired Research: Social Origins of Cognitive Development 229\nResearch stemming from the sociocultural perspective addresses a wide range of social contexts for\ncognitive development. Since teachers, parents, peers, and other significant individuals--and the\nlearning environments they create--are seen as the primary means of fostering development,\nsociocultural research is infused with educational meaning. Attention to culture is also threaded through\nmuch of the empirical literature. The following sections present a sampling of research endeavors,\ntheoretical issues, and related educational topics.\nAdult-Child Collaboration. In sociocultural theory, collaboration with teachers, parents, and other adults\nis a major way that children develop new competencies. The role of this joint activity is to provide\nchildren with experiences in their zone of proximal developmenttones that challenge them and that can\nbe accomplished with adult guidance. Several metaphors that describe the quality of this expert-novice\ncollaborative relationship have emerged in the research literature. Among the most important are\nscaffolding and intersubjectivity.\nScaffolding. The concept of scaffolding designates a changing quality of intervention over a teaching\nsession in which the adult offers a \"scaffold,\" or support system, by adjusting the help he or she\nprovides to the child's current level of performance (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976; Wood, 1989). As the\nchild displays increasing competence, effective scaffolders gradually and sensitively withdraw\nassistance, relinquishing responsibility for the task to the child.\nScaffolding is typically measured by coding the degree to which the adult shifts to less directive support\nafter the child succeeds on an element of the task and to more directive support after the child fails.\nFindings indicate that parents who are more effective \"contingent shifters\" have children who master\ntasks more readily (Pratt, Green, MacVicar, & Bountrogianni, 1992; Pratt, Kerig, Cowan, & Cowan, 1988).\nFurthermore, in two studies, a global rating of scaffolding resembling the well-known authoritative\nparenting construct (a combination of responsiveness to the child's needs and reasonable demands for\nmature behavior) predicted children's task-relevant private speech (efforts to regulate their own\nbehavior) and problem-solving success (Behrend et al., 1992; Berk & Spuhl, 1995).\nWhereas substantial support exists for the benefits of scaffolding, several Vygotskian scholars have\nargued that the typical image of an effective scaffolder who adjusts his or her tutoring to suit the child's\nneeds risks reducing the child to a passive recipient of the adult's teaching efforts (Packer, 1993; Rogoff,\n1998; Stone, 1993). According to Stone (1993), besides instruction, other behaviors are also important,\nincluding the quality of adult support, the interpersonal relationship between adult and child, and the\nvalue both partners attach to the situation, the task, and its associated behaviors. These mutual\ncontributions to learning have not been sufficiently emphasized in scaffolding research. However,\ninvestigations of such shared involvement are present in other literaturestfor example, in studies of\nearly language development that emphasize the importance of joint attention and mutuality in\ncommunication (Dunham, Dunham, & Curwin, 1993; Carpenter, Nagell, & Tomasello, 1998) and in\nstudies of make-believe play, which I treat in a later section.\nFurthermore, as Rogoff and her collaborators emphasize, the \"pedagogic\" mode of communication\ninherent in the scaffolding metaphor may be especially suited to child-oriented, academic tasks that are\ncommon in Western cultures. For example, Guatemalan Mayan caregivers are far less likely than\nAmerican caregivers to structure young children's learning situations. Instead, they expect children to\ntake greater responsibility through observation and participation in adult (rather than child-oriented)\nactivities. Consistent with these values, Guatemalan Mayan parents are less verbal in their teaching\ninteractions; they rely more on demonstration, unobtrusive directing, and monitoring while adjusting\nthe assistance they provide to the child's current competence (Greenfield, 1984; Rogoff, Mistry, et al., 230\n1993; Rogoff, Mosier, et al., 1993). These findings, and other similar ones, suggest that effective\n\"scaffolding\" varies from culture to culture and is best understood in terms of the values and\nrequirements of the child's society as a whole.\nTo account for children's diverse opportunities to learn through involvement with others, Rogoff (1990,\n1994) has suggested the term guided participation, a broader concept than scaffolding. Without\nportraying a particular model of interaction (thereby allowing for cultural variation), guided participation\ncalls attention to both the novice's and the expert's contributions. It also includes both deliberately\ninstructional (school and school-like) and everyday settings in which children acquire culturally adaptive\nknowledge and skills. Clearly, research on shared expert-novice participation is beginning to encompass\na wider range of personal and contextual factors.\nIntersubjectivity. Perhaps the most effective concept to date in underscoring the quality of\ncommunication that, from a sociocultural perspective, fosters development is intersubjectivity (Newson\n& Newson, 1975). It refers to a process whereby two participants who begin a task with different\nunderstandings arrive at a shared understanding. To achieve true collaboration and to communicate\neffectively, each partner must adjust to the perspective of the other. As partners negotiate and\ncompromise, their \"fusion of reference . . . creates a platform for subsequent joint action\" and further\ndevelopment (Rogoff, 1998, p. 686; Wertsch, 1984).\nThe concept of intersubjectivity is applicable to many contexts--parent-child and teacher-child\ninteraction, family discussions, and peer collaboration. Some theorists argue that the capacity for\nintersubjectivity is present early in life--in the young baby's mutual gaze, exchange of emotional signals,\nand early imitation of the caregiver (Meltzoff & Moore, 1992; Tronick & Cohn, 1989). Regardless of\nwhen intersubjectivity first emerges, it changes substantially with development. For Vygotsky, the\nacquisition of gestural communication and (shortly thereafter) language, permitting greater clarity of\ncommunication, should facilitate it.\nBy the second year of life, children often strive for intersubjectivity. Toddlers attend to adults' and peers'\nactivities and use of objects, actively trying to take another's perspective and perform similar actions. As\nthey do so, they acquire new skills (Eckerman & Didow, 1996; Rogoff, 1990; Ross, Conant, Cheyne, &\nAlevizos, 1992). Young children are also active in soliciting others' help and in directing that assistance to\nensure that it is beneficial (Azmitia & Hesser, 1993; Nelson-LeGall, 1992). In sum, the concept of\nintersubjectivity reminds us that children and adults jointly manage shared endeavorstand that the\ncontributions of both create the zone of proximal development.\nPeer Collaboration. In Vygotsky's view, assistance in the zone of proximal development can also occur\nwith more capable peers (Vygotsky, 1930c1935/1978). Earlier I noted that whereas Piaget emphasized\nthe value of conflict with peers who are coequals, Vygotsky stressed the facilitating impact of interacting\nwith peers who vary in expertise. Moreover, according to Vygotsky, peer conflict can contribute to\nheightened understanding, but only insofar as partners resolve their disagreements and move toward a\njoint, intersubjective view of the situation.\nConsistent with Vygotsky's view, researchers observing the dynamics of peer collaboration have found\nthat conflict and disagreement are not as crucial for development as the extent to which peers resolve\ndifferences of opinion, engage in joint decision making, and work toward common goals (Kobayashi,\n1994; Kruger, 1993; Tudge, 1992; Tudge & Rogoff, 1987). When cooperation and sharing of ideas do not\noccur, then cognitive gains are typically not observed (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989; Tudge, 1989). For\nexample, in a study of fifth graders solving math problems cooperatively, partners were more likely to 231\nmove toward correct strategies if they clearly explained and considered each other's ideas. A child could\npropose a correct strategy, but without partner acceptance it tended to be abandoned (Ellis, Klahr, &\nSiegler, 1994).\nA wealth of applied research in classrooms is enriching our understanding of contextual factors that\nfoster peer collaboration and gains in development. For example, studies of mixed-age grouping reveal\nthat when academic performance differs between mixed- and single-age classrooms, it favors the\nmixed-age arrangement. Self-esteem and attitudes toward school are also more positive, perhaps\nbecause mixed-age grouping decreases competition and increases harmony in the classroom (Jensen &\nGreen, 1993; Pratt, 1986). The opportunity that mixed-age groups afford for peer tutoring may also\ncontribute to their favorable outcomes. When older or more expert pupils teach younger or less expert\npupils, both tutors and tutees benefit in academic achievement and self-esteem (Hooper, Temiyakarn, &\nWilliams, 1993; Johnson, Johnson, & Taylor, 1993).\nHowever, simply putting peers together does not guarantee that they will engage with one another in\nways that lead to a higher level of understanding. The capacity of children to collaborate, like other\ncompetencies, is a developmental attainment that must be scaffolded by adults. An impressive example\nof peer collaboration under the guidance of adult experts is reciprocal teaching, a method designed to\nimprove reading comprehension in children who are at risk for academic difficulties (Brown & Palincsar,\n1989; Palincsar, 1992). A teacher supports a group of two to four pupils, who take turns leading\ndialogues on the content of a text passage. Gradually, the teacher releases responsibility for learning to\nthe children. Through group discussion, participants ask questions, clarify ideas, and achieve consensus\non meaningta process that helps ensure they will grapple deeply with concepts and restructure their\nknowledge, supported by the diversity of skills within the group. Evaluations reveal that participants\nshow substantial gains in reading comprehension compared to controls exposed to alternative\ninstructional strategies with the same reading materials (Lysynchuk, Pressley, & Vye, 1990; Palincsar,\nBrown, & Campione, 1993).\nThe values and practices of the larger community influence the ability of pupils to engage in and sustain\ncollaboration in classrooms. If adults do not collaborate in their own lives, then collaboration is harder\nto induce in children. Joint engagement in learning groups seems to come more easily to children with\ncollectivist rather than individualist cultural backgrounds. For example, Navajo children achieve this\nmutuality more readily than do European-American children (Ellis & Gauvain, 1992). Japanese classroom\npractices, in which children solve problems by building on one another's ideas, are situated in a larger\ncultural context that values interdependence in family and work life (Hatano, 1994). In contrast, cultural-\nmajority children in the United States typically consider competitive and individualistic approaches to\nlearning to be natural--a perspective that interferes with their ability to attain intersubjectivity in\ncooperative work groups (Foreman & McPhail, 1993).\nSchool reform experiments reveal that peer collaboration in classrooms works best when it is supported\nby similar ideals throughout the educational institution. The most extensive and well-known school\nrestructuring effort inspired by Vygotsky's theory is the Kamahameha Elementary Education Program\n(KEEP) (Tharp, 1993). Begun as an innovative educational system for academically at-risk ethnic minority\nchildren, KEEP classrooms are organized into activity settings, defined as \"contexts in which\ncollaborative interaction, intersubjectivity, and assisted performance occur\" (Tharp & Gallimore, 1988,\np. 72). Small groups of children rotate through the settings over a week's time (except for a focal literacy\nsetting, which they enter everyday), providing multiple opportunities for peers to work collaboratively.\nIn KEEP, each level of the school system is based on principles of assisted performance. Supervisors,\nprincipals, consultants, and other teachers jointly create activity settings for teachers to further their 232\ncompetence in assisting children's learning. This culture of cooperation is believed to have contributed\ngreatly to KEEP's success in augmenting the literacy skills and academic achievement of first to third\ngraders who typically do poorly in school.\nIn a related Vygotsky-inspired curricular approach, the classroom is transformed into a community of\nlearners in which the distinction between adult and peer contributions is relinquished; all collaborate\nand develop through sociocultural activities. This community-of-learners model is based on the\nassumption that different people have different expertises that can be helpful to other members of the\ncommunity, depending on the task at hand. Projects, not lessons, are the focus of classroom\nactivitiestcomplex real-world problems requiring many steps in which children and adults draw on one\nanother's expertise to move toward joint solution (for examples, see Brown & Campione, 1994;\nCognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1994; Moll & Whitmore, 1993).\nIn the efforts just described, peer collaboration itself becomes socially situated, embedded in a\nsociocultural system created from within by teachers and children and supported from without by its\nsurrounding cultural context. In this respect, some scholars have argued that Vygotsky's concept of the\nzone of proximal development needs to be broadened, from a view of a single child in collaboration with\na more expert partner (adult or peer) to a vision of multiple, interrelated zones (Moll & Whitmore,\n1993).\nPrivate Speech. Vygotsky's claim that the most significant moment in cognitive development occurs\nwhen young children use language not only for communication with others but also as a tool for\nregulating thought and action has inspired a steady stream of research on private speech. Our findings\njoin with those of other investigators to provide substantial confirmation of Vygotskian predictions on\nthe social origins and self-regulating role of children's speech to themselves.\nSocial Origins. Diverse findings support Vygotsky's assumption that private speech originates in early\nsocial experience. For example, moderate to strong positive correlations between children's social and\nprivate remarks have emerged in several investigations, suggesting that the two forms of language have\ncommon roots (Berk & Garvin, 1984; Kirby, 1997; Kohlberg et al., 1968). In addition, socially rich\ncontexts appear to foster private speech, since children talk to themselves more freely when they have\naccess to social partnersteither peers or adults (Goudena, 1987; Ramirez, 1992). Moreover, a\ncomparison of elementary school children's private speech while working on academic tasks in their\nclassrooms and in a solitary laboratory setting revealed a precipitous drop in private speech in the\nlaboratory (Berk & Landau, 1993). Isolating children from their sociocultural world and the opportunities\nit affords for dialogues with others dramatically affects the extent to which they engage in dialogues\nwith themselves.\nDevelopmental Course. The Vygotsky-predicted developmental course of private speech--from\nexternalized to internalized forms--has also amassed clear support. In both cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal investigations, audible task-relevant private speech declines with age while signs of inner\nspeech (inaudible muttering and lip and tongue movements) increase (Berk, 1986; Berk & Garvin, 1984;\nBerk & Potts, 1991; Berk & Landau, 1993; Bivens & Berk, 1990; Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985; Kirby, 1997).\nThese trends are evident among preschool and elementary school children, whether studied cross-\nsectionally or longitudinally. They are also apparent in microgenetic research, a type of longitudinal\ninvestigation in which children are followed as they engage in moment-by-moment learning of a\nchallenging task (Berk & Spuhl, 1995; Duncan & Pratt, 1997). Similar movement toward private speech\ninternalization at diverse ages and within a variety of task contexts suggests that rather than following a 233\nsingle overarching path of development (as Vygotsky predicted), private speech may re-emerge and\nabbreviate each time children tackle a new area of cognitive skill.\nConsistent with this idea, comparisons across studies using the same classroom observational\nmethodology indicate that private speech is particularly prevalent during the early grade-school years--\nabout twice as high as it is during the preschool period (Berk, 1986; Bivens & Berk, 1990; Krafft & Berk,\nin press). Literacy activities appear to be an especially rich context for verbal self-regulation as children\nfirst become immersed in consciously manipulating and controlling the symbolic systems of their\nculture. In support of Vygotsky's supposition that education fosters a self-reflective, metacognitive\napproach to thinking, recent research reveals that 6- and 7-year-olds, but not 4-year-olds, are aware of\ntheir inner speech (that \"a person can tell himself things and talk to himself up in his head\") and that\npeople are constantly engaged in thought (Flavell, Green, & Flavell, 1993, 1995; Flavell, Green, Flavell, &\nGrossman, 1995). The investigators speculated that increased consciousness of mental activity may\nresult from intensively experiencing one's own inner speech while engaged in reading, writing, and\nsolving math problems.\nSelf-Regulating Function. Studies consistently confirm the role of private speech in the development of\nself-regulation. For example, private speech increases with task difficulty, suggesting that children call\non it to overcome obstacles (Berk, 1992). More definitive support for its regulating role comes from\nresearch examining the relationship of private speech to task-related behavior and performance. While\nengaged in language arts and mathematics assignments, first- through fifth-grade children who\nfrequently use task-relevant utterances display fewer self-stimulating and distracting behaviors and are\nmore attentive (Berk, 1986; Berk & Landau, 1993, 1997). Moreover, in a longitudinal study in which\nchildren were followed from first to third grade as they worked on mathematics tasks, gradual\ninternalization of private speech went hand-in-hand with more effective channeling of behavior. That is,\nchildren who progressed more rapidly from audible, self-directed utterances to inner speech were also\nadvanced in their ability to focus attention and inhibit self-stimulating motor activity (Bivens & Berk,\n1990).\nEvidence for the self-regulating function of private speech also extends to children's task performance.\nIn previous research, private speech showed inconsistent relationships with concurrent performance\n(how well children did on a task at the time they manifested private speech). This apparent challenge to\nthe facilitating effects of private speech has been traced to two factors. First, many tasks typically given\nto children in the laboratory are either too easy or too difficult (not within the zone of proximal\ndevelopment) and therefore not suitable for evoking self-guiding private speech in all children (Berk,\n1992, 1994). Second, since private speech increases when children encounter obstacles to success, it\noften co-occurs with task failure (Diaz, 1992). In carefully designed, longitudinal investigations in which\ntasks were selected to be within children's zones of proximal development, private speech was\nconsistently associated with future performance, or gains in problem-solving competence assessed from\n2 days to 1 year after the original observation (Azmitia, 1992; Behrend, Rosengren, & Perlmutter, 1989,\n1992; Berk & Landau, 1997; Bivens & Berk, 1990; Gaskill & Diaz, 1991).\nIn sum, substantial empirical support has accumulated for Vygotsky's central premises on private\nspeech. There is convincing evidence that private speech originates in social experience, is progressively\ninternalized with age, and serves a self-regulating function.\nMake-Believe Play. Until recently, most researchers were guided by Piaget's (1945/1951) belief that\ntoddlers discover make-believe play independently, as soon as they are capable of representation. 234\nConsequently, the emergence of pretense was studied in isolation from the social and cultural contexts\nin which it usually occurs.\nVygotsky (1933/1978) in contrast, regarded make-believe play, like other higher mental functions, as\nsocially constructed. He believed that societies provide children with opportunities to represent\nculturally meaningful activities in play. Moreover, Vygotsky emphasized that the enactment of imaginary\nsituations and social rules during play (for example, children focusing on the roles and rules of the\nclassroom as they play school) strengthens understanding of social norms; the ability to think before\nacting; and, consequently, self-regulation. Finally, Vygotsky stated that make-believe play \"creates a\nzone of proximal development in the child. In play, the child always behaves beyond his average age,\nabove his daily behavior; in play it is as though he were a head taller than himself\" (p. 102). In sum,\nVygotsky regarded play as the leading educational activity of early childhood. (For a fuller discussion of\nVygotsky's ideas on make-believe play, see Berk, 1994; Nicolopoulou, 1993).\nVygotsky's theory has led to a spate of research on the development of pretense. A longitudinal study in\nwhich children were followed from 1 to 4 years of age while playing at home suggested that make-\nbelieve has social origins; the majority of pretense until age 3 involved mother-child interaction, even\nwhen children had ready access to child playmates (Haight & Miller, 1993). Findings of this investigation\nand others indicate that toddlers' make-believe with caregivers is more sustained and complex than is\ntheir solitary make-believe (Slade, 1987; Fiese, 1990; O'Reilly & Bornstein, 1993; Tamis-LeMonda &\nBornstein, 1991). In line with the zone of proximal development, very young children, for whom make-\nbelieve is just emerging, act more competently when playing with a mature partner than they otherwise\nwould.\nPlay with caregivers appears to prepare the child for playful cooperation with agemates. In Haight and\nMiller's (1993) study, mother-child pretense gradually gave way to child-child pretense, and children\nwhose mothers ranked high in pretending when their children were 1 year old ranked high in peer play\nat age 4. Play with agemates requires joint, responsive engagement to support development.\nIntersubjectivity among peer playmates, in the form of extensions and affirmations of one another's\nmessages, increases substantially during the preschool years (G\u00f6nc\u00fc, 1993). Interestingly, preschoolers\nhave greater difficulty establishing a cooperative, shared framework in nonplay problem solving (Azmitia\n& Perlmutter, 1989; Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989). As in the adult-child context, the child engaged in play\nwith peers is, in Vygotsky's words, \"a head taller than himself\"--advanced in comparison to other\ncontexts. By middle childhood, the social skills mastered during joint make-believe generalize to nonplay\nactivities.\nIn many cultures, adults do not play with children. Instead, older siblings take over this function, serving\nas caregivers for younger brothers and sisters in mixed-age play groups. For example, research in\nIndonesia and Mexico reveals that make-believe is more frequent and complex with siblings than with\nmothers. As early as 3 to 4 years of age, older siblings draw younger children into play activities and\nfrequently make comments and suggestions for more elaborate pretending. The fantasy play of toddlers\nin these cultures is just as well developed as that of their American counterparts (Farver, 1993; Farver &\nWimbarti, 1995; Gaskins, 1994). Moreover, older children granted opportunities to fill responsible roles\nwith younger children undoubtedly gain in perspective taking and sensitivity to others' needs.\nResearchers have begun to pay increasing attention to the impact of cultural values on the style and\norganization of children's play. In collectivist societies that stress group harmony, play takes different\nforms than it does in individualistic cultures like the United States. Children in India, for example,\ngenerally play in large groups that require high levels of cooperation. Much of their behavior during 235\nmake-believe and early games is imitative, occurs in unison, and involves close physical contact\n(Roopnarine et al., 1994). Similarly, Marquesan preschoolers of Polynesia gather in groups of as many as\nten children. Familiar, highly scripted activities reduce opportunities for disagreement. Older children\nhelp keep younger children orient toward group goals through persuasion and, sometimes, shaming\nwhen they drift off into self-centered play (Martini, 1994).\nFinally, my research group has begun to examine Vygotsky's assertion that make-believe play\ncontributes to the development of self-regulation. Observing 3- to 5-year-olds during free-choice\nperiods at preschool, we found that the incidence of private speech was much higher in fantasy play and\nplay involving engagement with peers than in nonfantasy and solitary play contexts. Moreover, in a\npreschool that de-emphasized make-believe play and peer collaboration, children displayed far less\nprivate speech than they did in a play-oriented preschool (Krafft & Berk, in press). These results provide\nsuggestive evidence that make-believe activities are vital contexts in which children learn to bring action\nunder the control of thought. To test this assertion more definitively, we have examined relationships\nbetween preschoolers' developing play competence and cognitive and social skills that depend on\nemerging verbal self-regulation. Our findings reveal positive associations (Bach & Berk, 1999; Elias &\nBerk, 1999).\nIn sum, a growing literature is addressing diverse sociocultural facets of children's play. Findings are\nconsistent with Vygotsky's view of make-believe as a vital zone of proximal development in which\npreschoolers subordinate their behavior to rules in socially constructed play scenes imbued with the\nvalues, expectations, and practices of their culture.\nChildren with Attention and Impulse Control Problems. Vygotsky's sociocultural approach has also been\nextended to the study of children with learning and behavior problems, thereby contributing to our\nunderstanding of developmental psychopathology. According to Vygotsky (1993), the path of\ndevelopment is altered because of compensatory behaviors that emerge due to the child's disability and\nbecause of the restrictive impact that the disability has on access to positive interactions with adults and\npeers.\nFor example, in the literature on children with sensory deficits, several studies reveal that due to greater\naccess to supportive parent-child interaction, deaf children with deaf parents (who communicate\nthrough sign language) develop more favorably than do deaf children with hearing parents (who either\ndo not use sign language or need time to learn to do so). Deaf children with deaf parents resemble\nhearing children in quality of parent-child interaction, development of private speech (manual signing to\nthemselves), and self-regulation. In contrast, deaf children of hearing parents, who experience less\npositive, sensitive, and stimulating exchanges with parents, display diminished use of task-relevant\nprivate speech and serious self-regulatory difficulties in academic and social development (Chess &\nFernandez, 1980; Jamieson, 1994, 1997; Jamieson & Pedersen, 1993). These findings suggest a clear,\nsociocultural basis of intervention for preventing learning and social-skills problems in deaf children with\nhearing parents.\nMy research group has focused on the private speech of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), whose symptoms of inattention and impulsivity also interfere with school learning and\nsocial relations. Recently, interest in the self-regulating function of private speech has increased among\nclinicians and researchers concerned with ADHD. In a prominent new theory, Barkley (1997) argues that\nchildren with this disorder suffer from a biologically-based deficit in response inhibition--that is, an\nimpaired ability to delay responding, cease ongoing behavior, and resist distraction from the\nsurrounding environment. This basic deficiency is believed to lead to secondary deficits in metacognitive 236\nprocessing, including impaired use of and internalization of private speech. Barkley's theory expands\nVygotsky's emphasis on the sociocultural origins of private speech by stressing the role of an intact\nneurological system for self-directed language to gain control over behavior.\nOur investigations offer strong support for Barkley's theory. We studied children clinically diagnosed\nwith ADHD and children with poor impulse control, the symptom presumed by Barkley to be the\ndefining deficit of ADHD. Both ADHD and impulsive children talked out loud to themselves more during\nacademic problem solving than did normal controls. When we examined age-related trends, we found\nthat children with ADHD and impulsivity were delayed in internalization of private speech; that is, they\nused audible, externalized self-talk over a longer developmental period than is typical among school-age\nchildren (Berk & Potts, 1991; Berk & Landau, 1993, 1997).\nSeveral additional findings suggested that this developmental lag was the result of an impairment that\nprevents ADHD children's private speech from gaining efficient mastery over behavior. First, when we\nincreased the difficulty of academic work, the private speech of impulsive children became disorganized;\nrather than increasing (like that of normal controls), it decreased and consisted of more irrelevant\nremarks (Berk & Landau, 1997). Second, private speech failed to predict improved attention and\nacademic performance for ADHD and impulsive children, whereas clear prediction of these indicators of\nself-regulation emerged for normal controls (Berk & Landau, 1993, 1997; Berk & Potts, 1991). Finally,\nwhen we observed ADHD children while they were both taking and not taking stimulant drug medication\n(known to augment neurological functioning), medication sharply increased the maturity of private\nspeech and its association with focused attention and control of motor activity (sitting quietly rather\nthan fidgeting) during academic problem solving (Berk & Potts, 1991).\nTaken together, findings on deaf children and children with ADHD underscore diverse paths to deficits in\nself-regulation. In the case of deaf children, whose basic neurological system is intact but whose hearing\nparents lack the \"mental tools\" (fluent sign language) to promote language development in their child,\nsocial experience accounts entirely for self-regulatory difficulties. In the case of children with ADHD, a\nbiologically based deficit in response inhibition seems to interfere both with access to adult supportive\ninteraction (see Landau, 1999, for a review) and with the ability of private speech to realize its self-\nregulating function. Our results suggest a need for intervention research that focuses on the\ncomplementary goals of reducing ADHD children's impulsivity and assisting them in making more\nstrategic use of the high rates of private speech they do display.\nThe work I have described on children with attention and impulse-control difficulties illustrates\nproductive links being forged between developmental and clinical theory and research. The fruits are\nnew insights into the multiple origins of serious learning and behavior problems and hope of improved\ntreatments.\nFuture Directions\nResearch emanating from the sociocultural perspective has contributed significantly to current revisions\nin our understanding of human development, especially to recent conceptions of diversity in\ndevelopmental pathways. The sociocultural perspective has been a major force in reminding the field\nthat unique combinations of biological and environment forces at multiple levels lead to both\nsimilarities and differences in trajectories of change.\nThe most significant contribution of the sociocultural perspective is a more sophisticated and detailed\nconception of the environment--specifically, the social and cultural environment at the very seam of\norganism-environment interaction. In its fine-grained examination of social collaboration within the 237\nzone of proximal development, Vygotsky-inspired research has given us a much deeper understanding\nof the everyday processes by which children become enculturated into their communities. This evidence\nis among current sources that have profoundly challenged researchers' and practitioners' tendency to\nthink in terms of broad, homogeneous classifications of individuals, such as \"socioeconomic status,\"\n\"ethnic minority,\" or (in the case of individuals with deficits and disabilities) undifferentiated labels such\nas \"low achiever\" or \"children with attention deficits.\" A careful look inside such groups--at life histories,\ncurrent experiences, and cultural and subcultural values and practices--uncovers wide individual\nvariation.\nUnderstanding and predicting change is the sine qua non of the field of human development, which\nassumes in all its activities that the past and present can inform us about the future. This principle is just\nas applicable to the sociocultural framework and the field of development as a whole as it is to the\ndeveloping person. I forecast a strengthening of the following ongoing directions within sociocultural\nresearch:\n\u2022 Stronger links with other research traditions in the domain of cognitive development. The\nsociocultural perspective has largely forged a body of evidence distinct from other\ncontemporary literatures in cognitive development, including neo-Piagetian and information-\nprocessing work and research on such capacities as perception, memory, representation, and\nproblem solving. In current reviews of the status of research on these topics, sociocultural forces\nare now acknowledged, but they are granted far less attention than such intraindividual forces\nas practice of task-relevant skills, expansion of the knowledge base, and biological maturation\n(see Kuhn & Siegler, 1998).\nIn a recent review, Rogoff (1998) predicted that the future would bring greater attention to\nsociocultural aspects of the cognitive phenomena just mentioned. Yet to attain this goal,\nsociocultural research must reach out to embrace and build on other methods and findings as\nmuch as it encourages other researchers to attend to the sociocultural perspective. The result is\nlikely to soften the strong Vygotskian claim that all higher cognitive processes develop through\nsocial interaction. Indeed, several research programs within other traditions stress the role of\nmechanisms within the person--experimentation with the physical world, quiet-time reflection,\nlogical reasoning, and multiple opportunities to test the efficacy of cognitive operations--for\ncapacities as diverse as children's understanding of their mental worlds; strategy use in\nmemorizing and in acquiring basic academic skills; and scientific problem solving (Flavell, Green,\n& Flavell, 1995; Kuhn, Garcia-Mila, Zohar, & Andersen, 1995; Siegler, 1996).\nAssessing the status of research on cognitive development at the end of the twentieth century,\nFlavell (1992) expressed pessimism about the lasting value of \"contextualist approaches\" (p.\n1003). This pessimism, which he left unexplained, might have stemmed from the observation\nthat the sociocultural tradition has proceeded largely in its own direction, without much\nattention to others. The message of history is that any explanation emerging within a single\ntradition has limits; a complete account of human change must ultimately attend to evidence\nand ideas in other traditions as well. As sociocultural investigators apply their belief in an\nintersubjective meeting of minds to their own research endeavors, we are likely to see the\nprocesses of social appropriation and individual discovery melded into a more comprehensive\ntheoretical systemtone that clarifies when each is most beneficial and how each supports the\nother. 238\n\u2022 Stronger integration of cognition with other domains of functioning. The sociocultural\nperspective has largely been applied to research on cognitive development. Yet its emphasis on\ncollaboration with expert partners as a source of development is applicable to other domains of\nfunctioning. Self-regulation is not solely the province of cognition; a growing literature on the\ndevelopment of emotional self-regulation reveals the importance of a diverse array of social\nexperiences, including sensitive face-to-face communication in infancy, parental modeling of\neffective strategies, conversations about emotions, and language-based techniques for gaining\ncontrol over emotional arousal (Saarni, 1997; Thompson, 1990). In the domain of social skills,\nresearch shows that parents of socially competent preschoolers arrange informal peer play\nactivities and offer advice, guidance, and examples of how to act toward others (Ladd, LeSieur,\n& Profilet, 1993). Such parents also gradually grant the older child and adolescent autonomy in\naccord with their readiness to assume itta support system akin to scaffolding (Collins, Harris, &\nSusman, 1995; Holmbeck, Paikoff, & Brooks-Gunn, 1995). In the realm of morality, parental\nwarmth, sensitivity, and explanations; peer discussions of moral issues; and the child's efforts to\nmake sense of social conflicts in which others' rights have been violated foster moral\nunderstanding (Turiel, 1998; Walker & Taylor, 1991).\nAlthough the parallels are striking, these literatures and Vygotsky-inspired cognitive research\nhave hardly touched shoulders. Efforts to integrate them promise to help us discern which social\nexperiences promote development broadly and which ones are unique to specific domains of\nfunctioning. Moreover, emotional and social skills are vital for children to collaborate in the\nzone of proximal development, and cognitive development supports many emotional and social\nskills. Consequently, bringing the sociocultural perspective to bear on the emotional and social\ndomains should greatly enrich these strands of inquiry while extending and refining the\nsociocultural approach.\n\u2022 Greater attention to the natural, or biological, line of development. Vygotsky stated that the\nnatural and social lines of development join, forming a single developmental pathway. Yet in\nfocusing on the social line, he said little about the natural (biological line). Investigators in the\nsociocultural tradition continue to pay less attention to the biological substrate of development\nthan do researchers of other theoretical persuasions. (An exception is the literature reviewed\nearlier on the private speech of children with attention and impulse-control problems.) Yet\ncurrent evidence suggests that neurological changes--from brain growth spurts to lateralization\nof the cerebral cortex--are profoundly influenced by experience (Fisher & Bidell, 1998;\nGreenough et al., 1993; Neville, 1991). In addition, accumulating research shows that children's\ncompetence is best promoted when parenting and teaching strategies are in tune with\nchildren's biologically based dispositions (Kagan, 1998; Pellegrini & Horvat, 1995).\nAs they attend to the biological side through contact and collaboration with investigators\nspecializing in psychophysiological methods and brain-behavior relationships, sociocultural\nresearchers will have much to contribute to our understanding of the interface between biology\nand environment. A particularly valuable contribution is likely to be a stronger cultural\nperspective in the study of temperament, behavior disorders, sensory deficits, and learning\ndisabilities. Already we know that parents and teachers view shyness, sociability, and\ndifficultness quite differently, depending on cultural context--attitudes that affect children's\nadjustment (see, for example, Chen, Rubin, & Li, 1995; Weisz et al., 1995). The sociocultural\nperspective is well suited for building on these understandings. We may soon see, as a result,\nthat many biology-environment interactions are culture-specific. 239\n\u2022 Expansion of longitudinal research to include microgenetic investigations. To fully understand\nperson-environment interactions that lead to development, researchers will need more than the\nsnapshots of change offered by the widely spaced observations of traditional longitudinal\nresearch. More studies are likely to be microgenetic--moving in close to track change as\nindividuals master a novel or everyday task (see Kuhn, 1995; Siegler & Crowley, 1991, for\nanalyses of the strengths and limitations of this method).\nWithin the sociocultural tradition, the microgenetic method has offered valuable glimpses into\nthe flow of interaction between experts and novices and into children's internalization of private\nspeech. Adherents of other cognitive perspectives have used the method even more vigorously,\ngreatly enriching our understanding of how children participate in their own development by\nexperimenting with strategies as they acquire new skills (see, for example, Schauble, 1996;\nSiegler, 1996). As microgenetic evidence expands, researchers may be in a more favorable\nposition to tackle the formidable problem of how to meld this microcosmic view of change with\nthe macrocosmic view provided by other longitudinal studies. These efforts should also inform\nus about an issue raised earlierthow socially and personally based mechanisms of change work\ntogether.\n\u2022 Increased influence on practice. Sociocultural theory has already had a profound impact on\npractice, and it will undoubtedly continue in that vein. Its core assumptions, that higher mental\nfunctions first emerge socially, within the zone of proximal development, and only later\npsychologically, are likely to inspire many new teaching experiments and educational reforms.\nThese include refinements in collaborative learning; grouping arrangements that bring novices\nand experts into closer proximity; and contextual modifications--activity centers, small class\nsizes, and culturally sensitive teaching strategies that foster the dialogues so vital, in the\nsociocultural view, for spurring development. At the institutional level, alternatives to grade or\nage placements may arise, in response to the realization that not all classmates and agemates\nfunction within the same zone of proximal development. Within school administrative\nstructures, cultures of cooperation may become more widespread, in recognition that creating\nzones of proximal development at higher levels helps ensure that they will emerge within\nclassrooms.\nIn early childhood education, where tensions persist between child-centered and teacher-\ndirected philosophies, the sociocultural perspective offers a potential resolution, in advocating\nadult responsiveness to children's capacities in ways that lead development forward. Within this\ndebate, play continues to struggle for legitimacy as teacher-controlled goals threaten to\ndominate it, justified by the need to prepare young children for academic learning (Hart et al., in\npress; Stipek & Byler, 1997). Sociocultural research grants renewed validity to play as the\nsupreme educational activity of the early years, and it should spark new play-based curricula.\nIn the field of developmental psychopathology, the sociocultural approach may inspire\ninnovative therapies for children with self-regulatory difficulties. Play therapy, at one time a\nmajor psychoanalytic tool, may return in new forms, as a promising approach in which impulsive\nand ADHD children can transcend their present level of development and become better able to\nmanage their own behavior. Perhaps therapeutic procedures will also capitalize on adult-child\nand child-child dialogues within the zone of proximal development, drawing on such\ninterventions as reciprocal teaching to ameliorate academic and social difficulties (Diaz & Berk,\n1995). 240\nAs Vygotsky-based educational and therapeutic practices gain wider acceptance, assessment\nprocedures are likely to change, from traditional tests that emphasize already attained\ncompetencies to dynamic assessments that uncover what the developing person can acquire\nwith the assistance of a more knowledgeable partner. Although a variety of dynamic assessment\nsystems currently exist (see Lidz, 1991; Luther, Cole, & Gamlin, 1996), they have not yet caught\nhold broadly. Yet education and therapy grounded in Vygotsky's zone of proximal development\nwill require philosophically compatible assessments aimed at identifying potential to learntthe\nripening capacities of today or tomorrow rather than those of yesterday.\n\u2022 Enhanced knowledge of culture, collaboration, and development. Sociocultural theory is\nresponsible for a greatly expanded knowledge base on cultural variations in expert-novice\ninteraction. As this work continues, it is likely to encompass a wider range of cultures (especially\nnon-Western) and situations, including everyday (nonschool) activities, about which we have\nrelatively little information (Rogoff, 1998). Furthermore, sociocultural research has largely\nfocused on dyads--a teacher, a parent, or a peer interacting with a child--in part because of the\ngreater prevalence of dyadic interchanges in U.S. middle-class than in other cultures (Rogoff et\nal., 1993). In many homes, neighborhoods, and classrooms, communication often takes place in\ngroups, the dynamics of which have rarely been examined from a sociocultural perspective.\nCultural variations in collaboration extend to people with whom we communicate at a distance,\nincluding the internalized voices of influential texts, former teachers, and members of previous\ngenerations. These communicative partners have been addressed in a small literature extending\ninto adulthood (see, for example, John-Steiner, 1992; Wertsch, 1991). They merit considerably\nmore research for a full appreciation of human shared endeavors. Furthermore, innovation in\ntechnological societies has yielded a wide range of tools for bridging time and space in\ncommunicationtamong them, telephones, fax machines, electronic e-mail, and the internet.\nStudies of how people of different ages and within different settings use these devices, along\nwith their impact on face-to-face interaction, are underway and likely to increase (Crook, 1994;\nWindschitl, 1998). This avenue of research is expanding our definition of community and our\nunderstanding of the impact of culture on social participation and development.\nWhat do the next 15 years hold for developmental psychology as a whole? The trends identified at the\nbeginning of this chapter will undoubtedly proceed apace. Interconnections with other subfields of\npsychology and other disciplines will become increasingly important for understanding biology-\nenvironment interactions and developmental processes at the psychological, immediate social-setting,\ncommunity, and cultural levels. More research groups will need to combine expertise in genetics and\nneurology with in-depth knowledge of the contexts in which human beings move through life to grant\ngreater clarity to a theme threaded throughout this chaptertpluralism of developmental pathways.\nConsequently, the study of development is likely to become less localized in an identifiable assembly of\nexperts and increasingly distributed among various disciplines.\nIn his day, Vygotsky regarded fragmentation in the field as a crisis. He argued that there was a need to\nwork toward a theoretical framework that would unify diverse observations (Wertsch, 1985). It is\ndoubtful that the field will soon reach consensus on a single theoretical perspective. At the same time, it\nseems to be moving toward broader agreement that the various systems views (e.g., ecological systems\ntheory, dynamic systems theory, family systems theory, the lifespan perspective) carry important\nlessons for a wide range of phenomena. These approaches have in common an emphasis on the\ndynamic relation between the individual and multilevel contexts as necessary to explain development.\nThey also recognize that a synthesis of perspectives is needed to advance knowledge. 241\nA vital message that Vygotsky's sociocultural theory offers--to itself and to the larger field of\ndevelopment--is the power that collaborative endeavors hold for creating zones of proximal\ndevelopment that move theory and research forward. As more interdisciplinary and researcher-\npractitioner partnerships form, longitudinal research will be enriched by the methodologies of diverse\ndisciplines. As a result, developmental inquiry is likely to include not just traditional quantitative\nprocedures, but qualitative approaches that better reflect the developing organism in context as a\ncomplex, functioning whole. Because of their longer tradition of conducting research within the ecology\nof people's lives, education and sociology are ahead of developmental psychology in enlarging their\narsenals of methods (Walsh, Tobin, & Grau, 1993; Peshkin, 1993). As the field of development follows\nsuit, the returns will be great for both scientific and practical knowledge.\nHow individuals just beginning their careers best prepare themselves to participate in the endeavors just\ndescribed? More than ever before, developmental researchers of the twenty-first century will need\ninterdisciplinary preparation. They will also benefit from immersion in the world of practice for at least a\nperiod of their careerstas teachers, clinicians, nurses, physicians, practicing psychologists, social workers\nor, if not practitioners, participant observers who become thoroughly familiar with the proximal and\ndistal environments of the organism they wish to study.\nResearchers of the future will also need collaborative skills, and nurturing those skills will need to be far\nmore central to their education than it is today. New trends in the field may prompt substantial changes\nin way developmentalists are trained. Instead of research being performed by a solitary student under\nthe supervision of a single mentor, the master's and doctoral dissertations of the twenty-first century\nmay involve peer collaborations with interdisciplinary teams of mentorstlearning environments that\nmirror the research environments that the next generation of scholars must create to advance the field.\nIn conclusion, like the persons and contexts they study, great diversity is likely to characterize the\ndevelopment of future developmental researchers, who will access the field from a much wider range of\nbackgrounds and perspectives. If their endeavors truly become, in the sociocultural sense, a\ncollaborative processtthe work of communities of scholarstthen exciting gains await us in knowledge of\ndevelopment and in interventions that enhance well-being throughout life.\nReferences\nAbbotts, B., & Osborne, L.

Huss\nCreighton University\nAspiring psychology students are often drawn to psychology and law by exciting media portrayals of\nviolent crimes, expert testimony in a publicized case such as the O. J. Simpson trial, or sensational movie\ndepictions of criminal profilers \"catching the bad guys.\" Although the study of criminal behavior and\ntheories of crime may have provided a significant contribution and even historical impetus for the field\n(Grisso, 1991; Hess, 1996; Loh, 1981), the intersection of psychology and the law has grown into a broad\nand increasingly sophisticated subdiscipline of psychology (Melton, Huss, & Tomkins, 1998; Wiener,\n1997). This chapter's examination of the full expanse of this emerging field is not meant to discourage\nthe student initially drawn to the more sensational aspects of psychology and law. In fact, it is intended\nto encourage students to explore all that is exciting about this budding area. Though psychology and law\nis comparatively young, it is in a position to make a unique contribution to society and science both\nbecause of its interdisciplinary nature and its ability to answer applied question\nThis chapter first describes what is meant by terms like psychology and law and forensic psychology.\nBecause of the relative youth of the field, I will briefly discuss earlier research efforts in two broad areas\n(i.e., general psychology and law and forensic psychology) and some of the hottest topics in these areas.\nFurthermore, a specific topic in forensic psychology that is of the most interest to me, risk assessment,\nwill be examined in more depth both by examining the current state of the area and the future\ndirections researchers are likely to pursue. I will then examine the future of the general field of\npsychology and law. Finally, I will offer some advice for students interested in pursuing a career in\npsychology and law.\nWhat is Psychology and Law?\nSimply put, anything that falls within the intersection of psychology and the legal system can be\nconsidered within the scope of psychology and the law. The imprecision of this definition allows for a\nvery broad and ever expanding field that is only limited by the imagination and the continually evolving\nlegal system (Bartol & Bartol, 1994). Because research in psychology and law is shaped by the legal\nsystem, the basic and applied nature of psycholegal scholarship are equally important. Traditional\npsychological research often seeks to address basic principles of human behavior. Legal and forensic\npsychologists are forced to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the courtroom by the very nature\nof the applied topic they study. This statement is not meant to minimize the contribution of basic\npsychological research to psychology and law. There are numerous tenants of cognitive, developmental,\nsocial, and clinical psychology at work in psycholegal research. However, psychology and law offers a\nsomewhat special and direct application of its principles to a real world laboratory, the legal system,\nthat few other areas of psychology are able to do.\nThe real world application of psychology and the law has been identified at least since Hugo\nMunsterberg (1908) made grand claims regarding the promise that psychology held for the legal system\nnearly a century ago in his pioneering book On the Witness Stand. Some of the early research was 255\ninspired by the real world events like the kidnaping of Charles Lindbergh's young child and subsequent\ntrial of the alleged perpetrators (McGehee, 1937). Early psycholegal research also was used before the\nUnited States Supreme Court's finding that public school segregation was unconstitutional (Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 1954). One of the more publicized cases involving the use of psychological expertise\nin the courtroom occurred during the Harrisburg Seven trial in the early 70's. In this politically charged\ncase, Phillip Berrigan and seven other men were on trial for a number of antiwar activities. A group of\nsocial scientists joined the defense team to offer their expertise to select a jury favorable to the\ndefendants. The team of experts sought to identify a number of demographic characteristics (e.g.,\nreligion, age, gender, education) that were be related to a bias for convicting the defendants (Schulman,\nShaver, Colman Emrich, & Christie, 1973).\nFrom these early ventures into the courtroom, psychology and the law has experienced tremendous and\nrapid growth during the past 20 years (Ogloff, Tomkins, & Bersoff, 1996; Melton, 1992). The growth of\nthe field is marked by the establishment of specialized journals (e.g., Behavioral Sciences and the\nLaw, Criminal Justice and Behavior, Law and Human Behavior, and Psychology, Public Policy, and the\nLaw), increasing use of psychological testimony and the examination of psycholegal research in court\ncases (e.g., Lockhart v. McCree, 1986), the establishment of professional organizations (e.g., American\nAssociation for Correctional Psychology; American Board of Forensic Psychologists; American\nPsychology-Law Society), and the creation of graduate training programs specifically in psychology and\nlaw (see generally, Bersoff, Goodman-Delahunty, Grisso, Hans, Poythress, & Roesch, 1997; Hess, 1996;\nMelton et al., 1998; Ogloff et al., 1996; Otto, Heilbrun, & Grisso, 1990, Tomkins & Ogloff, 1990). The\nexpansion of psycholegal research and the field's increasing promise to society as a whole is remarkable\n(Melton, 1992).\nThe subdiscipline of psychology concerned with the legal system has been referred to as psychology and\nlaw, forensic psychology, psycholegal studies, correctional psychology, etc., and its identity has been\ndebated almost since it inception (Hess, 1996; Grisso, 1991). The diverse focus of the field has fueled\nmuch of the debate.\nTraditionally, psychology and law is divided into a few discrete, but related areas (Bersoff et al., 1997).\nThe more clinical aspects of psychology and law, forensic psychology, tend to cover areas such as\npsychological assessment, prediction and reduction of future dangerousness, and interventions\ndesigned to rehabilitate criminal offenders. More experimental topics in psychology and law are most\noften based in the social, personality, cognitive, or developmental, areas of psychology. Examples of\nthese areas include jury decision making, eyewitness identification, the impact of expert witnesses, and\nthe role of children in the courtroom. Another area of psychology and law that is achieving prominence\nexamines the impact of court decisions, legislative action, and administrative conclusions on the beliefs\nand behavior of society. Many individuals believe these policy issues may hold the greatest promise for\npsychology and law to make a meaningful contribution to society (Melton, 1992). However, policy\naspects of the field are often reflected in the forensic or general psychology and law research and will\nnot be described separately.\nThe diverse nature of psychology and law is apparent in the articles published in Law and Human\nBehavior, the official journal of the American Psychology-Law Society/Division 41 of the American\nPsychological Association, in one calendar year (i.e., 2000). The journal included a range of topics: the\nnature of coerced confessions, polygraph procedures, alternative trial procedures, the impact of pretrial\npublicity, the influence of appointed and retained counsel on capital cases, and recidivism rates among\nsex offenders to name but a few. Though the journal focused on experimental or psycholegal topics in 256\nthe past (Wiener, 1997), of a total of 37 topical articles or research notes in the past year, 12 (32%) were\nforensic in focus, 19 (51%) focused on the more experimental areas of psychology and law, and 6 (16%)\nwere policy oriented. Of course, these categories are not mutually exclusive and this crude comparison\nis only meant to be descriptive of the field. Other psychology and law journals such as Behavioral\nSciences and the Law, Criminal Justice and Behavior, and Legal and Criminological\nPsychology, Psychology, Crime and Law, Psychology, Public Policy, and the Law have their own\norientations toward psychology and law. These journals all reflect the diverse and broadening nature of\npsychology and law.\nThe breadth of psychology and law makes it impossible to identify and summarize all of the compelling\nresearch issues in the area. However, a cursory examination of several major topics in psychology and\nlaw provide a good starting point for students interested in the field as well as established professionals\nunfamiliar with the literature. This examination of general psychology and law research will focus\nprimarily on jury selection and decision making, and eyewitness identification. Discussion of forensic\nresearch will deal with traditional clinical concepts of treatment and assessment within the legal\ncontext. It should become evident that psychology and law is distinctive in its direct application.\nResearch can assist in the imprisonment of individuals, in putting them to death, in suggesting when\nsome should be released, and in setting some free. The effects can be very real and very profound.\nJury Selection and Juror Decision Making Methodologies Employed by Legal Psychologists\nA predominant methodology in psychology and law research has been the use of mock jurors to\nrepresent the functioning of actual jury members as they behave during the trial process (i.e., jury\nsimulations). Jury simulations usually consist of participants being exposed to the facts of a case either in\nthe form of a brief scenario, a lengthy trial transcript, or a videotaped reenactment. These mock jurors\nare then asked to render a verdict and/or sentence as if they were actual jurors in the case. Jury\nsimulations may be conducted with individual mock jurors or in groups ranging anywhere from 6-12.\nIndividuals may discuss or deliberate as jurors normally do in criminal and civil cases or simply come to\nindividual decisions.\nResearchers in the field have long been critical of this methodology for its lack of generalizability to\nactual jurors (Vidmar, 1979; Weiten & Diamond, 1979). Jury simulations are criticized because of their\nuse of college students as the majority of participants, brief trial summaries to represent hours of actual\ntrial testimony, the lack of deliberation among jury members, and inappropriate dependent measures\n(e.g., confidence, degree of responsibility etc.) that are not options in real trials where jurors simply vote\nguilty or not guilty (Weiten & Diamond, 1979). Diamond (1997) revisited the methodological concerns\nshe and Weiten raised almost 20 years ago and concluded that some have been addressed whereas\nothers have largely been ignored. Diamond (1997) and others have called for researchers to continue to\nimprove jury simulations to address the concerns raised by the courts when evaluating the applicability\nand usefulness of the research.\nThe body of literature focusing on jury decision making has fallen into identifiable areas (Penrod &\nCutler, 1987). Much of the initial research focused on individual characteristics including demographic,\nattitudinal, and personality factors. More recent research examined jury decision making from\nevidentiary and procedural perspectives.\nPredictors of Mock Juror Verdicts and Scientific Jury Selection 257\nThe focus on individual differences in juror decision making was primarily an outgrowth of psychological\ninterest in scientific jury selection (Schulman, et al., 1973). Scientific jury selection held that individual\ndifferences among jurors would influence the final verdict. Individual differences included demographic\ndifferences (e.g., sex or age) or attitudinal and personality differences (e.g., pro-death penalty or\nauthoritarianism). For example, psychologists and legal actors wanted to know whether a white, middle-\naged man would be more prone to decide a particular case in one direction compared to a elderly,\nHispanic woman. They were also interested whether a female attorney would be more persuasive in a\nparticular case or an African-American judge would impact the outcome. It should become apparent\nhow valuable such information could be to parties on either side of an issue. However, reviews of the\njuror literature found largely inconsistent results and concluded that most individual differences are not\nstrong predictors of final verdict choices (Penrod & Cutler, 1987; Penrod & Fulero, 1990). More recent\nresearch may provide better contextual answers to the earlier conclusions (e.g., Narby, Cutler, & Moran,\n1993) and suggest greater promise for the predictive power of these variables.\nDemographic variables such as sex, age, income, education, religion, and race have shown minimal\npredictive power in regard to ultimate verdict decisions (Goodman, Loftus, & Greene, 1990; Updike &\nShaw, 1995). Race and sex have produced more robust outcomes when the case facts are specifically\nfocused on issues seemingly more relevant, as in cases of sexual assault, domestic violence, or a\nminority group defendant (Crowley, O'Callaghan, & Ball, 1994; Gowan & Zimmerman, 1996; Greenwald,\nTomkins, Kenning, & Zavodny, 1990; Pfeifer & Ogloff, 1991). Though some inconsistency still exists in\nregard to the juror demographics, increasing evidence is suggests that sex and racial characteristics of\nthe important legal actors (judge, attorney, and defendant) may also play a prominent role in juror\ndecision making (Goodman, Loftus, Miller, & Greene, 1991; Gordon, 1990).\nStudies assessing attitudes and personality also report mixed results. Researchers have not found a\nconsistent relationship between aspects of personality such as belief in a just world, locus of control,\nsocialization, and conviction-proneness (Mills & Bohannon, 1980; Moran & Comfort, 1982, 1986). Two\nexceptions appear to be attitudes toward the death penalty and authoritarianism. Though the Supreme\nCourt has refused to recognize the conclusions in regard to juror attitudes toward the death penalty\n(Lockhart v. McCree, 1986), results of a number of studies suggest a tendency to convict by those who\nare pro-death penalty (e.g., Cowan, Thompson, & Ellsworth, 1984; Fitzerald & Ellsworth, 1984;\nEllsworth, Bukaty, Cowan, & Thompson, 1984). Authoritarianism also has demonstrated greater\nconsistency than the other attitudinal and personality characteristics while a review suggests that\nauthoritarianism, especially legal authoritarianism, correlates strongly with the verdict decision (Narby\net al., 1993). Legal authoritarianism is the specific belief in the authority and just power of the legal\nsystem and its actors.\nEffects of Courtroom Procedure on Mock Juror Verdicts\nAlthough individual differences, primarily among jurors but also the other legal actors, have resulted in\nmodest relationships with trial outcome, the juror literature focusing on evidentiary and procedural\naspects of the legal system appear to have resulted in greater insights (Penrod & Cutler, 1987).\nProcedural aspects of psychology and law research, focus on the methods and processes by which\nindividuals (e.g., defendants, victims, judges, jurors, attorneys) move through the legal system, primarily\nthose procedures occurring during criminal and civil trials. A number of Supreme Court decisions have\nresulted in important procedural changes that spurred psychologists into new areas of investigation\n(e.g., Batson v. Kentucky, 1986; Wainright v. Witt, 1985). Our legal system is constantly striving for\njustice and psycholegal research often is able to offer answers into procedural changes that the courts 258\nare contemplating or have already taken action upon. Investigations of trial procedures have focused on\nthe size of the jury, the specific instructions given to the jury prior to deliberation, the unanimity of jury\ndecision rules, and pre-trial publicity, juror note taking among others.\nSeveral Supreme Court decisions during the 1970s concluded that juries smaller than the standard 12\nperson jury did not violate constitutional due process requirements (Ballew v. Georgia, 1978; Colgrove v.\nBattin, 1973, Williams v. Florida, 1970). However, concern was expressed that a reduction in the actual\nsize of the jury could impact the quality of the deliberation, the reliability of the jury's fact-finding, the\nratio of non-guilty to guilty verdicts, individual ability to resist majority pressure, and community\nrepresentation of the jury (see Williams v. Florida, 1970). A recent quantitative review (i.e., meta-\nanalysis) of the literature revealed larger juries are more likely to contain minority group members,\ndeliberate longer, become deadlocked more often, and demonstrate greater accuracy in recall of the\ntrial testimony (Saks & Marti, 1997). Saks and Marti (1997) concluded the results suggest that the courts\nshould re-examine their prior rulings in regard to the appropriateness of juries of less than 12 members.\nJurors' comprehension of the instructions they receive from the court prior to beginning their\ndeliberation has been thoroughly investigated. Studies have examined juror comprehension of death\npenalty instructions (Haney & Lynch, 1997), insanity instruction (Ogloff, 1991), and cases involving\nbattered women who kill (Terrance, Matheson, & Spanos, 2000). This research generally reveals that\njurors have difficulty understanding and applying judicial instructions. Though efforts have been\nundertaken to suggest modifications of jury instructions (Lind & Patridge, 1982), few alterations have\nbeen successful in improving juror comprehension (e.g., Haney & Lynch, 1997).\nStudies have shown that other legal and extra-legal procedural factors can also impact verdict outcome.\nFor example, U. S. Supreme Court decisions allowing trial courts to use less than unanimous verdicts\nhave prompted researchers to find that simple majority opinions may provide less opportunity for\nmembers to dissent but that these juries may demonstrate better recall of the trial testimony (Saks,\n1977). Several studies also revealed that pretrial publicity has a tremendous impact upon verdict\noutcome and suggested that extensive steps should be taken to reduce or eliminate any resulting bias\n(e.g., Moran & Cutler, 1997; Ogloff & Vidmar, 1994; Studebaker & Penrod, 1997; Studebaker,\nRobbennolt, Pathal-Sharma, & Penrod, 2000). Other studies have revealed the advantages and\ndisadvantages of jurors taking notes during testimony (Heuer & Penrod, 1989, 1994), allowing jurors to\nask questions (Heuer & Penrod, 1988), judicial instructions to deadlocked juries (Smith & Kassin, 1993),\nprivately retained versus court appointed attorneys (Beck & Shumsky, 1997), and improvement in the\npretrial questioning of perspective jurors (Middendorf & Luginbuhl, 1995).\nThe Impact of Evidentiary Psycholegal Research\nA number of researchers have also investigated evidentiary aspects of the legal process. Many times the\npresentation of a piece of evidence in a particular manner or at a particular point in the trial may have\nprofound impact upon the ultimate decision of the jurors. Researchers have examined the impact of\nexpert witnesses across a broad range of case specific facts, the impact of out of court statements\nregarding a fact in question (i.e., hearsay), the presentation of information on coerced confessions,\nevidence on statistical probabilities, and a number of mediums for the presentation of evidence (e.g.,\ncomputer animation). Attorneys want to know how they can best persuade a jury to believe in their\nclient's innocence in a criminal trial or that their client has been wronged civilly. Psycholegal research is\noften able to lend some assistance with regard to the persuasiveness or impact of particular types of\nevidence. 259\nThe largest body of evidentiary psycholegal research has focused on the use of expert witnesses. These\nresearch efforts are largely the result of the increasing demand for psychologists to testify on issues\nranging from battered women syndrome to eyewitness memory. The presentation of expert testimony\ncan be an opportunity to reeducate the jurors about particular psychological phenomena that are\nbeyond the everyday knowledge of the juror (Blackman & Brickman, 1984).\nMuch of the initial research centered on the impact of expert testimony to explain the relevant factors\nthat influence eyewitness identification such as the relationship between eyewitness confidence and\nrecall accuracy, the suggestibility of their memory, the presence of a weapon, and the impact of\ndifferent police line-up procedures (see Cutler & Penrod, 1995). Additional efforts have examined the\nimpact of expert testimony evidence focusing on battered woman syndrome (Schuller, Smith, & Olson,\n1994), a defendant's insanity plea (Rogers, Bagby, Crouch, & Cutler, 1990), child sexual abuse (Crowley\net al., 1994), rape trauma syndrome (Frazier & Borgida, 1992), and possible age discrimination (Raitz,\nGreene, Goodman, & Loftus, 1990). Though some studies appear to suggest that the introduction of\nexpert testimony is not always effective in specific cases (compare Kasian, Spanos, Terrance, & Peebles,\n1993, with Schuller & Hastings, 1996), studies have largely concluded that expert testimony can have a\nsignificant impact on the manner which jurors process the trial related information and their ultimate\nverdicts (e.g., Penrod & Cutler, 1987).\nThe literature has continued to develop by not simply focusing on the impact of the introduction expert\ntestimony in a variety of cases but by also examining more contextual issues (e.g., Kovera, Gresham,\nBorgida, & Gray, 1997). Studies have examined the impact that the strength of the expert's credentials\nhave upon juror decision making (Cooper & Neuhaus, 2000), judicial limiting instructions (Schuller,\n1995), complex presentations of expert evidence (Diamond & Casper, 1992), and the extent to which\nexperts are allowed to issue testify (Fulero & Finkel, 1991). This research further identified the\ncircumstances under which expert testimony is most likely to have an impact on the decision making\nprocess and when it is likely to inform the jury (Kovera et al., 1997). Given that expert testimony is\nincreasingly being used in our court systems and that the courts have been increasing the scrutiny with\nwhich they examine such evidence (Landsman, 1995), it would appear that being able to identify those\nfactors that make an expert's testimony more meaningful to judges and juries would hold real promise\nfor making a difference in the judicial process.\nThe examination of evidentiary factors in psychology and law research extended beyond expert\ntestimony to a number of legally relevant and innovative issues. For example, Kassin and Neumann\n(1997) examined the impact of admission of the defendant's confession at trial compared to eyewitness\nidentification, character testimony, or none of these. Results suggest that confessions are significantly\nmore powerful than other types of evidence (Kassin & Neumann, 1997). Kassin and Sukel (1997)\ndemonstrated that coerced confessions increased conviction rates even when jurors see them as less\nvoluntary and believe they have less impact on the decision than a more voluntary confession. Studies\nalso found that hearsay testimony, testimony given by a victim witness out of court, has a powerful\nimpact upon juror decision making (Golding, Sanchez, & Sego, 1997; Schuller, 1995). The impact of\nstatistical or probability evidence (e.g., evidence in DNA cases) has a significant impact on jurors'\ndecisions, even though jurors do not use it in a perfectly appropriate manner (Smith, Penrod, Otto, &\nPark, 1996). Studies have examined the mediums by which we display evidence such as graphic\nphotographs (Douglas, Lyon, & Ogloff, 1997) and computer-animated displays (Kassin & Dunn, 1997).\nThey generally find that the more elaborate displays of evidence have greater impact on verdict\ndecisions and that jurors may even deny that they had a greater impact on their decision making (see 260\nDouglas et al., 1997).\nIt should be understood from this brief review of the literature that psycholegal research is not simply\nconducted within a vacuum. This research is used in arguments before the United States Supreme Court,\nby attorneys in specific trials and even conducted in anticipation of a particular trial in order for one side\nto better prepare their case. Alterations in the types of people serving on a jury, the size of the jury, the\ntype of expert testimony that is offered, or whether a confession is coerced out of a defendant can have\na profound impact on real people. Innocent people can go to prison and guilty people can be acquitted\nbecause of a failure to pay attention to psycholegal research or even on the basis of it.\nEyewitness Identification and Recall\nOne of the most substantial bodies of research in psychology and law focuses on eyewitness memory or\neyewitness identification. The scientific study of eyewitness memory has largely remained within the\ndomain of psychology and the general study of memory has been integral to the development of\npsychology as a science (Wells, 1995). Eyewitness research primarily has focused on the victims of crime\n(i.e., eyewitnesses) and the factors that influence eyewitness performance. However, the issues\nimportant to eyewitness researchers have not strictly focused on memory constructs but also on other\ncognitive as well as social processes (Ross, Read, & Toglia, 1994; Wells, 1995). Many psycholegal\nresearchers argue that the quantity of research focusing on eyewitness identification is a direct result of\nthe magnitude of the problem of wrongful convictions based on false eyewitness reports (Loftus, 1993).\nCutler and Penrod (1995) further conclude in their extensive examination of the literature that the\naccuracy of eyewitness identification is clearly impacted by a host of variables and that identification\nerrors are not infrequent, though their frequency can not be conclusively determined by the\npsychological literature at this time.\nVariables Influencing Eyewitness Identification\nOne area of eyewitness research has focused on variables specific to the witness that influence later\nidentification. Static or stable characteristics include sex, race, intelligence, age, and general facial\nrecognition ability. Studies have found that such stable variables are not especially predictive of\nidentification accuracy (Cutler & Penrod, 1995). Results focusing on dynamic or more malleable witness\nfactors are mixed. For example, store cashiers are often told to pay special attention to a would be\nrobber's face so that they can accurately identify them. Shapiro and Penrod (1986) made a quantitative\nexamination (i.e., meta analysis) of several studies looking at differences among participants who either\nexpected future identification or did not. Their results suggest that future expectations do not improve\nlater identification accuracy (Shapiro & Penrod, 1986). Shapiro and Penrod (1986) also found that\ntraining participants in facial recognition to better remember perpetrator faces did not significantly\nimprove their identification accuracy. However, they did find that training programs focusing on\nelaboration techniques where the participant is trained to make inferential personality judgments based\non facial characteristics improve later identification accuracy (Shapiro & Penrod, 1986). These results\nseem to suggest that there may be particular witness variables that are beneficial in improving\neyewitness identification accuracy.\nThe effect of a number of variables concerning the target characteristics of the witnesses identification\nhave also been investigated. Shapiro and Penrod's (1986) meta-analysis once again only found\nsignificant predictive relationships between the distinctiveness of the target's appearance and later\naccuracy. Target sex and race alone were not found to consistently impact the accuracy of the witnesses 261\nidentification across the entire literature (Shapiro & Penrod, 1986). Studies have found that changes in\nfacial characteristics (e.g., hair style, eye glasses, facial hair) and the use of disguises significantly alter\nparticipants' in later identification of the witness (e.g., Cutler, Penrod, & Martens, 1987a, 1987b;\nPatterson & Baddeley, 1977). The literature thereby indicates that specific target characteristics may\nhold some promise in regard to their influence on the accuracy of witness identification.\nThe environment in which both the original event occurred and the post event information/setting took\nplace are very often also significant factors in the accuracy of witness identification. Important research\nquestions in this area include: What are the situational factors associated with eyewitness accuracy?\nDuration of the target exposure? Presence of a weapon? The seriousness of the crime? The general level\nof arousal experienced by the eyewitness? Cross-race identification and cross-gender identification of\nthe witness and the target. All of these factors have been linked to the later accuracy of witness\nidentification to varying degrees (Cutler & Penrod, 1995). For example, though witness and target race\ndo not impact witness accuracy independently, when examined together own race recognitions are\nmore accurate than other race recognitions (Anthony, Cooper, and Mullen, 1992). Post event factors\nsuch as the interval between the original witnessing of the event and the later identification, the\nmanner in which the target is displayed (e.g., mugshots, lineup characteristics), and the recreation of the\noriginal witness context have all been found to alter accuracy of later identification (Cutler & Penrod,\n1995).\nEyewitness research primarily has focused on the influence of visual cues, mainly facial recognition, to\nthe exclusion of the recollection of auditory information (Melara, DeWitt-Rickards, & O'Brien, 1989).\nHowever, auditory information may be the only evidence in some cases and a less developed line of\nresearch has centered around earwitness identification. Situations may occur in which a witness needs\nto identify a voice on the telephone, the direction of a gun shot, or source of a scream. Clifford (1980)\nreports that many of the basic flaws and assumptions of eyewitness identification have counterparts in\nearwitness identification. Earwitness researchers focus on many of the same questions. What effect\ndoes stress or arousal have upon the accuracy of recall? Does the gender or age of the speaker or the\nlistener impact the accuracy of the witness? Are their certain interviewing and lineup procedures that\ncan be used to better assist the witness in their identification or even bias them in one direction? Early\nefforts at testing this claim have found similar parallels between the eyewitness and earwitness\nliteratures (e.g., Huss & Weaver, 1996; McAllister, Dale, & Keay, 1993; Yarmey, 1995).\nRelated Eyewitness Areas\nSeparate from the issues of eyewitness identification, researchers have also attempted to improve\neyewitness reporting by investigating techniques designed to more fully and more accurately elicit\ninformation from eyewitnesses (Fisher, 1995). An approach that has led to a number of encouraging\nresults is the use of the Cognitive Interview (see Fisher & Geiselman, 1992). This technique focuses on\ncognitive, social, and communication factors underlying eyewitness recall; it improves eyewitness\nrecollection (Fisher, 1995). Research also has been conducted on the impact of the construction and\nconduct of police lineups. A review of this literature points to four criteria that could reduce the number\nof false convictions: (a) inform the eyewitness that the defendant may not be in the lineup, (b) construct\nthe lineup so the suspect does not stand out, (c) the person administering the lineup should be blind as\nto the identity of the suspect, and (d) the certainty of the witness should be assessed before it can be\ncontaminated by future interactions with the suspect (Wells & Seelau, 1995).\nA controversial topic in the eyewitness literature becoming increasingly important because of recent\ncourt cases is that of repressed or recovered memories (Lindsay & Read, 1995). The debate over 262\nrepressed memories focuses on the scientific existence of childhood memories remaining hidden or out\nof the conscious awareness of an individual, only to return years later. Many researchers have expressed\nconcern over the prevalence of child abuse and its damaging effects on the victims but have questioned\nthe existence and prevalence of so called repressed memories (e.g., Loftus, 1997; Loftus & Ketcham,\n1994). However, others have been equally vehement in their beliefs that millions of child sexual abuse\nvictims carry hidden memories of these events into adulthood (e.g., Bass & Davis, 1994). Cases in which\nadult victims of child sexual abuse pursue legal action against their abusers 10, 20, or even 30 years later\npose special problems for the legal system on a number of different levels (e.g., statute of limitation in\ncriminal cases, admissibility of repressed memory testimony, legal need for additional substantiated\ntestimony) and therefore hold great promise for psycholegal research to offer important information on\nthe possible formation and prevalence of repressed memories (Lindsay & Read, 1995). In addition, the\nissues of childhood memory/witnessing go well beyond the arguments regarding the existence,\nprevalence, or possible induction of recovered memories. There is a large body of literature focusing on\nspecific problems with questioning child witnesses and how to address those problems effectively\nwhether the issue is childhood abuse or not (Perry & Wrightsman, 1991).\nResearch in the Treatment of Forensic and Correctional Offenders\nResearch in forensic psychology is often separate and distinct from the broad field of psychology and\nlaw. The American Board of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society (1995) define\nforensic psychology as:\nthe professional practice by psychologists within the areas of clinical psychology, counseling psychology,\nneuropsychology, and school psychology, when they are engaged regularly as experts and represents\nthemselves as such, in an activity primarily intended to provide professional psychological expertise to\nthe judicial system (p. 6).\nSuch a definition focuses the field on the mental health aspects of psychology and the law and away\nfrom the more experimental areas of jury selection and eyewitness identification. Issues in forensic\npsychology typically include appropriate interventions for criminal offenders, prediction of future\ndangerousness, issues surrounding competency and insanity, the feigning of mental illness (i.e.,\nmalingering), civil commitment, juvenile delinquency, child abuse, and neglect among others. Due to\nspace limitations there are a number of issues relevant to clinical psychology that will not be examined\nunder the framework of forensic psychology. In general most forensic research, as is true in most\nresearch in clinical psychology, can be divided into that focusing on treatment and assessment.\nThe criminal justice system attempts to balance its treatment of offenders between two primary\nobjectives: punishment for prior bad acts and prevention of future bad acts (Harvard Law Review, 1996).\nConcern over increasing crime rates has polarized policy makers with some individuals proposing to\nreduce criminal recidivism through harsher criminal sanctions (e.g., McCorkle, 1993) and other persons\ncalling for the use of mental health interventions to decrease criminal behavior (e.g., Gendreau & Ross,\n1987). Researcher want to be able to answer a number of questions. Is it possible to effectively treat\ncriminal offenders? If so, what treatments are most likely to be effective? Are these treatments equally\neffective for all criminals?\nThe early theories of criminal behavior that were spawned by a belief in rehabilitative efforts offered a\npreliminary foundation from which later interventions and treatment approaches were derived for\ncriminal offenders (e.g., Yochelson & Samenow, 1976). As evaluations of offender treatment were\nproduced (e.g., Kassenbaum, Ward, & Wilner, 1971), pessimism grew that the psychological 263\ninterventions were not effective in rehabilitating criminal offenders (Martinson, 1974). However, more\nrecent qualitative and quantitative reviews of the vast body of offender treatment literature are more\noptimistic and specific about what interventions are effective (Andrews, et al., 1990; Gendreau, 1996).\nMental health interventions have often meet with mixed success among offender and antisocial\npopulations (Stone, 1993); however, increasing attention is being focused on the cognitive correlates of\ncriminal behavior and related treatment strategies (Andrews & Bonta, 1994). For example, one of the\nkey elements in the treatment of sex offenders has been a focus on their cognitive distortions (Murphy,\n1990). Some of the interest on cognitive correlates of criminal behavior can be traced back to the work\nof Yochelson and Samenow (1976) whose cognitive interpretation of criminal behavior identified a\nnumber of cognitive distortions that are characteristic of the criminal personality. Several researchers\nhave since suggested that programs focusing on cognitive functioning are most likely to produce positive\ntreatment outcomes (Izzo & Ross, 1990; Ross, Fabrino & Ewles, 1988).\nA number of researchers have identified and described a special segment of the offender population\nthat appears to be the most dangerous, most resistant to intervention, and more likely to drop out of\ntreatment (Hare, 1996). These individuals are often referred to as psychopaths and pose a special\nproblems for forensic psychologists. Cleckley (1976) originally identified a number of traits associated\nwith the psychopath including: (a) superficial charm and \"good\" intelligence, (b) absence of delusions\nand other signs of irrational thinking, (c) absence of nervousness\" or psychoneurotic manifestations, (d)\nunreliability, (e) untruthfulness and insincerity, (f) lack of remorse or shame, (g) inadequately motivated\nantisocial behavior, (h) poor judgment and failure to learn by experience, (i) general poverty in major\naffective reactions, (j) specific loss of insight, (k) unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations, (l)\nfantastic and uninviting behavior with drink and sometimes without, (m) sex life, impersonal, trivial, and\npoorly integrated, and (n) failure to follow any life plan.\nPsychopaths are estimated to be 15-30% of the total correctional population and differ from other\ncriminal offenders along a number of important dimensions (Harris, Rice, & Cormier, 1991). These\noffenders are more likely to commit violent crimes and exhibit higher rates of violent recidivism than\nnon psychopaths (Harris et al., 1991; Williamson, Hare, & Wong, 1987). Psychopaths also are more likely\nto victimize strangers than non psychopaths (Hare, McPherson, & Forth, 1988). In addition, research\nindicates that insight-oriented therapies are not highly successful with psychopaths and may even result\nin greater recidivism rates among treated psychopaths (Rice, Harris, & Cormier, 1992). Newman and\nWallace (1993) have further proposed a response modulation hypothesis that focuses on the cognitive\ndeficits of the psychopath that may provide additional implications for the treatment of even these most\nserious criminal offenders.\nAreas of Special Interest in Forensic Assessment\nA second major area of research interest in forensic psychology has been forensic assessment. The\ncourts often call on clinical psychologists to provide their psychological expertise in a matter before the\ncourt (e.g., insanity, competency to stand trial, likelihood of future dangerousness at the time of\nsentencing). Though there has been much debate among legal and psychological commentators as to\nthe appropriate role of clinical psychologists in these matters, research and practice continue to focus\non the area (see Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slobogin, 1997).\nCompetency\nOne of the assessment issues most often faced by forensic psychologists is that of competency (Melton 264\net al., 1997). The general premise of the law is that a individual defendant must demonstrate particular\nminimum requirements in regard to their understanding of legal procedures and the possible\nconsequences of any legal decision (see Dusky v. United States, 1960) if the interests of the individual\nand society are to be appropriately served by the law (Reisner & Slobogin, 1990). Much of the research\non competency asks whether we are consistent and valid in our assessments and what measures are the\nmost helpful. Furthermore, what variables are likely to be associated with competency? Competency\nmay arise throughout the legal system in regard to standing trial, entering a plea, entering into a\ncontract, and ability to consent to medical treatment (Melton et al., 1997). Though there are separate\nand distinct areas of competency, courts have ruled that defendants are required to exhibit similar\nabilities across different issues of competency (Godinez v. Moran, 1993).\nThough competency is a very broad legal term that takes on a number of different forms both in civil\nand criminal cases, competency to stand trial is by far the most prevalent issue a forensic psychologist\nmust face and occurs in 10-15% of criminal cases (Poythress, Bonnie, Hoge, Monahan, & Oberlander,\n1994). Of those individuals actually referred for competency evaluations, an average of 30% are initially\nfound incompetent (Roesch & Golding, 1980). Early studies suggested that most of those individuals\nfound incompetent to stand trial have marginal education, few ties to the community, have never been\nmarried, and have long histories of criminal justice and mental health involvement (Steadman, 1979).\nHowever, more recent research has found no differences between incompetent defendants and control\ngroups in terms of education and mean number of arrests (Hoge, et al., 1997). Hoge et al. (1997) found\nthat incompetent defendants differ from other defendants in regard to their history of hospitalization\nand outpatient mental health treatment, IQ, psychoticism, and depression.\nThough studies have found competency evaluations to be consistent across clinicians, examinations of\nthe validity of these assessments have found that clinicians who are well trained can also achieve high\nvalidity (Nicholson & Kugler, 1991). Attainment of high reliability and validity figures have at least been\ndue in part to the development of structured evaluations formats such as the Competency Screening\nTest, the Competency Screening Instrument, the Interdisciplinary Fitness Interview, and the Georgia\nCourt Competency Test. Nonetheless, these instruments have been criticized for their limited focus on\nthe issue of competency and lack of standardized administration (Grisso, 1986; Roesch & Golding, 1987;\nRoesch, Ogloff, & Golding, 1993). Recent development of the MacArthur Competence Research\nInstruments was intended to eliminate many of these criticisms (Appelbaum & Grisso, 1995; Hoge et al.,\n1997).\nInsanity\nA number of misconceptions surround another area of forensic psychology, the defendant's mental\nstate at the time of the offense or insanity. Although the general public believes a large number of\ncriminal defendants use the insanity defense, an eight-state study conducted by Callahan, Steadman,\nMcGreevy, and Robbins (1991) found the insanity defense was used in only 1% of all felony cases. The\npublic also believes that most defendants who use the insanity defense are acquitted. Again, in the\nCallahan et al. (1991) study, they found that defendants were successful in only one-quarter of those\ncases in which it was used. A later study by Silver, Cirincione and Steadman (1995) confirms these\nfindings. People also express concern that defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity are released\nback to society shortly after their trials. Steadman and Braff (1983) found that the average hospital stay\nwas three and one-half years and the length appeared to be increasing over time. They also found\nlonger stays for criminals who committed more serious crimes. Studies also show no difference in 265\nrecidivism rates or slightly lower recidivism rates for defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity\ncompared to guilty defendants (Cohen, Spodak, Silver, & Williams, 1988).\nResearchers focusing on insanity attempt to address many of the same questions as those focusing on\nincompetency do. What characteristics are associated with someone being insane? How can I reliably\nassess insanity and what psychological tools will be the most effective? However, research on the\nreliability and validity of insanity assessment is largely absent and those that have been conducted\nemploy a number of dissimilar methodologies (Melton et al., 1997). Studies assessing the validity of\ninsanity evaluations also are rare and suffer from the same methodological shortcomings from which\ncompetency studies suffer (Melton et al., 1997). Formal assessments of insanity are rare compared to\ncompetency evaluations. In fact, only the Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scale has been\ndeveloped to assess insanity in a systematic manner; it has demonstrated acceptable preliminary\npsychometric properties (Rogers, Dolmetsch, & Cavanaugh, 1981).\nThough insanity standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and have changed over time, all\nstandards require the presence of a mental illness. Research suggests that defendants exhibiting\npsychotic characteristics are most likely to be found not guilty by reason of insanity (Melton et al.,\n1997). Because the presence of a mental illness is necessary for the insanity defense, there is an obvious\nincentive to feign mental illness. As a result, feigning mental illness or malingering is a concern in\ninsanity evaluations as well as most forensic evaluations.\nMalingering\nThough it is difficult to determine conclusively whether an individual is feigning mental illness, there are\na number of mechanisms by which forensic psychologists can assess the probability of malingering. The\nMMPI has been used to determine malingering and has shown some ability to differentiate between\nhonest responders and malingerers (Rogers, Sewell, & Salekin, 1994). Responses on psychological\nmeasures that even the most severely impaired person would be likely to succeed on, failure to take\ninto account the difficulty of items where one would assume that \"normals\" do better on the easier\nitems and poorer on the more difficult items, making approximate answers (i.e., near misses), scores\nbelow chance, inconsistent or atypical presentation, and especially marked variations in performance on\nseveral similar tests are all characteristic of malingering (Binder, 1992; Rogers, Harrell, & Liff, 1993).\nMoreover, Rogers and colleagues have developed a structured interview, the Structured Interview of\nReported Symptoms (SIRS), as method to detect malingering and found it has the ability to detect\nmalingering (Rogers et al., 1991; Rogers, Gillis, Dickens, & Bagby, 1991; Rogers, Kropp, Bagby, Dickens,\n1992).\nRisk Assessment\nMy own interests lie primarily in one of the most pervasive and increasingly important areas of forensic\nresearch both in terms of clinical practice and the law, risk assessment. I remember beginning my\nstudies of psychology and wondering how one person could commit such horrific violence while other\npeople could perform completely altruistic and self sacrificing acts. This led me to become interested in\nthe scientific prediction of violence or risk. I wanted to be able to predict with some accuracy who the\n\"bad boys\" were going to be and what they were going to do. What were the situations that were more\nlikely for them to become violent? What types of factors were likely to reduce their risk? Today risk\nassessment or risk management is one of the hottest topics in forensic psychology. 266\nForensic psychologists are routinely called on to make assessments of an individual's risk to commit\ndangerous acts in sentencing, civil commitment, juvenile transfer, and insanity decisions (Heilbrun,\n1997). Assessments in these matters may have far reaching impact and at least in part determine\nwhether a person receives jail time, if they are institutionalized in a mental hospital, the length of their\ncriminal sentence, if they are to be released from a mental hospital or prison, and even whether they\nare to be executed. Early efforts at risk assessment and dangerousness prediction, often referred to\nas first generation studies, were criticized because of clinicians' marked inability to accurately predict\nfuture violence with any certainty at above chance levels (Monahan, 1981). It was often said that one\ncould flip a coin and predict as well as the \"experts\" at the time. These efforts were criticized because\nmost of the high risk offenders used as participants were never released from the institution,\npredictions were not based on clinical assessments but administrative decisions, and researchers' use of\npoor outcome measures of violence (Monahan, 1981). However, recent reviews have been much more\noptimistic about the scientific basis for making risk assessments (see Grisso & Tomkins, 1996; Monahan\n& Steadman, 1994).\nSecond and third generation studies have demonstrated that forensic psychologists are able to predict\nviolence at higher than chance levels in at least some circumstances (e.g., Harris, Rice, & Quinsey, 1993;\nLidz, Mulvey, & Gardner, 1993; Mossman, 1994). Researchers have begun to focus on both male and\nfemale participants, short-term hospitalizations and predictions, and multiple criterion measures\n(Monahan, 1996). The improvements in risk assessment can be largely attributed to constructive efforts\nat critiquing the body of research (e.g., Monahan, 1981, Otto, 1992) and the move away from clinical\ndecision making and toward actuarial or empirically based decision making (e.g., Hare, 1991; Webster,\nHarris, Rice, Cormier, & Quinsey, 1994). Moreover, continued legal use of dangerousness predictions,\ndespite their scientific shortcomings (e.g., Barefoot v. Estelle, 1983), provides an impetus for forensic\npsychologists to improve their reliability and validity.\nThe use of actuarial or structured approaches, scales or psychological batteries mark a significant step\nforward for the practice and research of forensic psychology. Though the specific names of these\ntechniques may not be of great importance to you, the identification of a growing list of measures\nattempting to quantity or objectively measure particularly subjective constructs in forensic psychology is\nof great importance. These structured approaches provide evidence of significant improvement in the\nforensic decision making process over simple clinical judgment.\nOne of the earliest measures used for risk assessment is the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL; Hare, 1980).\nThe revised version of the PCL, the PCL-R, consists of 20 items that are scored on a 0-2 point scale and\nassessed via both a semi-structured clinical interview and collateral review of psychiatric and\ncorrectional records (Hare, 1991). Though the PCL was not intended to be a measure of risk assessment,\npsychopathy has been identified as the single best predictor in the assessment of future violence (Rice &\nHarris, 1995; Serin, 1996). Moreover, the PCL and PCL-R have demonstrated acceptable reliability and\nvalidity (e.g., Harpur, Hare, & Hakstian, 1989; Kosson, Smith, & Newman, 1990; Newman & Kosson,\n1986; Smith & Newman, 1990).\nMeasures intended solely for the prediction of dangerousness have also been developed, many of which\nhave incorporated psychopathy as a factor (e.g., Violence Risk Assessment Guide and the HCR-20). The\nViolence Risk Assessment Guide (VRAG) is a 12-item measure that was empirically derived from a\nsample of patients at a maximum security hospital (Harris et al., 1993). The items include scores on the\nPCL-R, elementary school maladjustment, marital status, age at index offense, victim injury index, male\nvictim index offense, history of alcohol abuse, diagnosis of personality disorders and schizophrenia, 267\nseparation from parents under the age of 16, failure on a conditional release, and history of property\noffenses. Further studies have shown that the VRAG performs equally well on forensic and prison\npopulations, at shorter and longer intervals, and for different operationalizations of violence (see Rice,\n1997). The HCR-20 is a 20-item measure to assess risk for future violence in offender and psychiatric\npopulations with a scoring system similar to that of the PCL. The HCR-20 focuses on the historical,\nclinical, and risk variables believed to be the most relevant to predictions of future violence (Webster &\nPolvi, 1995). Though the evidence is limited at this time, independent raters appear to be able to code\nthe HCR-20 reliably while it also demonstrates acceptable validity (Douglas & Webster, 1999). In\naddition, preliminary evidence indicates that the HCR-20 may be a better predictor than the PCL, largely\ndue to the PCL:SV being an item within the HCR-20 (Douglas, Ogloff, Nicholls, & Grant, 1999).\nOne of the major difficulties with earlier efforts at risk assessment was the use of solely forensic and\noffender populations. However, research has begun to focus on additional populations such as sex\noffenders, psychiatric inpatients, and community samples (Borum, 1996). Quinsey, Rice, and Harris\n(1995) developed an instrument for use on sex offenders and studies found that identification as a\npsychopath is associated with sex offending (e.g., Barbaree, Seto, Serin, Amos, & Preston, 1994). McNiel\nand Binder (1991) conducted research on the risk factors for inpatient violence. They developed an\nactuarial instrument for inpatient populations that outperformed most studies of clinical judgment and\nincludes history of attacks, absence of suicidal behavior, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or mania, gender,\nand marital status as important variables (McNiel & Binder, 1994). Research was conducted on\ncommunity samples (e.g., Gardner, Lidz, Mulvey, & Shaw, 1996). Gardner et al. (1996) compared their\nactuarial procedure with clinician's predictions of community violence for a sample of patients with\nmental illnesses. The actuarial methods were more accurate than the clinical predictions (Gardner et al.,\n1996).\nThe Future of Risk Assessment and Dangerousness Prediction Research\nNot only am I excited about how far the risk assessment literature has come but the future for my area\nof specialization appears even brighter. Though research on the prediction of dangerousness has been\nseverely criticized over the last 20 years (e.g., Monahan, 1981), current efforts reflect tremendous\nimprovement over the early attempts at risk assessment (e.g., Mossman, 1994). However, there are a\nnumber of ways in which future research could advance (e.g., Monahan & Steadman, 1994). Such\nadvances will be in terms of methodology, policy considerations, and front-line use by practitioners.\nThe most important trend that must continue is the use of actuarial or structured methods of violence\nprediction. Much of the improvement in our ability to predict dangerousness can be traced to our\nimprovement in actuarial methods such as the PCL, VRAG, or methodologies employed by McNiel and\nBinder (1994) and Gardner et al., (1996). The next generation of research will extend these measures\ninto specific subsamples as described before. The Spousal Risk Assessment Guide (Kropp, Hart, Webster,\n& Eaves, 1994), which focuses on perpetrators of domestic violence, is a structured approach in the\nearly stages of development. The next generation of actuarial tools will be designed for similar specific\npopulations. Although a measure such as the PCL-R may well be useful beyond the general offender\npopulations, preliminary research on risk factors in specific areas such as domestic violence already\nsuggests deviations from the predictive models associated with the first generation of actuarial tools\n(Saunders, 1995).\nAlthough broad-based actuarial methods may offer a significant advancement, they fail to account for\nthe specific context in which the violence occurs (see Monahan & Steadman, 1994 for the importance of\ncontext). A particular personality disorder or age of the victim may well predict the probability of 268\nviolence within a serious offender population, however, these variables are unlikely to generalize to\nperpetrators of domestic violence in the same manner. Moreover, context should not be viewed as a\nstatic variable but a dynamic one that is continually reassessed (Steadman et al., 1993). Currently, risk\nassessment is usually a one time event used to predict a single future event. The idea of an ongoing risk\nassessment naturally lends itself to the continuing management of risk assessment (Heilbrun, 1997).\nThe issue of context should not only apply to the context in which the violence occurs but also the legal\ncontext in which the assessment is taken (Heilbrun, 1997). Many clinicians assume that the\ndangerousness they attempt to communicate in a civil commitment is parallel to dangerousness in the\nsentencing phase of a murder trial. However, it has been argued that clinicians need to take into\naccount this legal context in their communication of dangerousness predictions (Schopp, 1996). It seems\nintuitive that a forensic psychologist also needs to take the legal context into account when formulating\nthe actuarial tools used in the risk assessment. Future research will likely focus on the legal context as\nwell as the context in which the dangerous behavior takes place.\nThe statistical analysis used to communicate risk is methodological issue of great relevance to future\nresearch. Much of the dangerousness research has presented the results in terms 2 x 2 contingency\ntables in which yes/no decisions are easily communicated and depend on violence base rates (Hart,\nWebster, & Menzies, 1993). However, the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) is a technique\nindependent of base rates that may more accurately describe and communicate the true probability of\nrisk (Gardner et al., 1996; Mossman, 1994; Rice & Harris, 1995). ROC techniques have been borrowed\nfrom the psychophysiological literature examining signal detection theory. ROC techniques allow the\ndecision maker to identify the point on a curve at which the most accurate decision can be made while\nbeing aware of the possibility of a false alarm. Mossman (1994) reports that in reanalyzing data from 44\nprior risk assessment studies that ROC results strongly suggest predictions stronger than chance. Though\na description of the intricacies of ROC is beyond the purpose of the current chapter, results of the above\nstudies as well as its theoretical advantages over prior methods of analyses suggest that it offers a very\nuseful tool for future violence research, especially those populations in which base rates are far lower\nthan criminal populations.\nThe clinical utility of these methods of risk assessment to individual practitioners or community agencies\nis another issue of potential relevance. Though many of the most recent actuarial methods provide for\ngreater predictive accuracy, they have limitations for small scale assessments. A forensic psychologist\nperforming an evaluation assessing the dangerousness of an individual acquitted of murder may find a\nlengthy interview and review of defendant's records too time consuming (e.g., PCL-R). A psychologist on\na forensic unit may not have the resources to administer a lengthy measure or review records that are\nnot immediately available. Although it may also be the duty of the staff psychologist to design a system\nin which such information is available, researchers should also keep in mind that the usefulness of a\nmeasure can vary tremendously given the resources available (Elbogen, Calkins, Tomkins, & Scalora, in\npress).\nBeing able to predict and control human behavior is basic tenant of the discipline of psychology. Risk\nassessment attempts to do exactly that. I am personally very encouraged about the future of risk\nassessment. Forensic psychologists have come a long way in the last twenty years and have a fairly clear\nideas of where they need to be in the next twenty years. However, it is not an easy task to predict\nhuman behavior with so many external factors at work all interacting to increase and decrease the\nprobability of a particular individual acting out violently. The promise of this field and the willingness of\nresearchers to learn from their past efforts excite and motivate me to be a part of it all. 269\nFuture of Psychology and Law Research\nMany of the issues likely to be important in regard to risk assessment are not unique to forensic\npsychology but also apply to the broader field of psychology and the law. For example, the importance\nof context also extends to much of the jury simulation research. Early efforts examined the impact of\njuror sex or personality differences but future research will continue to emphasize legally relevant\nevidentiary and procedural aspects. Psychology and law topics have long been criticized for being\npsychologically interesting while failing to exploit the legal relevance to its utmost. It may be\npsychologically fruitful to examine the effect of a particular procedural manipulation on the legal\noutcome; however, if the law is unlikely to adopt such a change because of legal precedent or legal\nutility, it is unlikely that this research will be legally meaningful. Research in psychology and law must\nstrive to not only be interesting to the psychological researcher but also the legal community.\nAs investigators in psychology and law attempt to improve the legal relevance of their research, they will\nneed to pay greater attention to the court cases that shape their laboratory. For example, a United\nStates Supreme Court case (Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1993) clarified the previous\nstandard for the admission of scientific evidence, the Frye Standard. Many individuals argue this case\nhad real world implications concerning the type of evidence psychologists may testify to in court (see\nFaigman, 1995). The implications may also extend to the rigorousness of the research, the particular\nmethodology employed, and to the types of evidence that are generally allowed (Faigman, 1995;\nFaigman, Porter & Saks, 1994; Penrod, Fulero, & Cutler, 1995). Though Daubert may be especially\nsignificant in terms of its broad impact, case law increasingly drives the research psychology (e.g., Neil v.\nBiggers, 1972). Future researchers will have to pay increasing attention to the developing case law to\nassure the legal relevance of their labors.\nMuch of the psychology research focuses on issues of significance to criminal law. Perhaps researchers\nfind these issues personally appealing, however, there are other areas of the law which also hold\npromise for psychology and law researchers. For example, a study by Stolle and Slain (1997) represents\none of the few studies designed to examine the impact of contract law on our daily lives. We enter into\nsuch contracts whenever we purchase a movie ticket, check our coat, sign for repairs on a home\nappliance, and so on. Stolle and Slain (1997) found that individuals rarely understand the legal\nsignificance of these documents. Examination of the psychological principles at work in less popular\nareas of the law such as administrative law, estate law, and tax law also are under represented. An\nappropriate metaphor might be found between psychology's avoidance of most areas of the law and\nfrontier wilderness of early 19th century United States. To realize the full impact of psychology, these\nunexamined areas of the law must be explored.\nThe absence of overarching theoretical frameworks of paradigms to offer cohesion and direction to the\nfield also have attracted criticism. However, there are some examples of paradigmatic efforts to\norganize the field. Monahan and Walker (1993) have categorized social science research in order to\nbetter assist legal decision makers. They propose that research which attempts to change the law be\nidentified as social authority, research specific to a particular case be termed social fact, and research\nused in combination of these two be identified as social framework. They further argue some of this\nresearch should be treated as legal precedents, not as facts before the court (Monahan & Walker, 1988).\nThe result would allow for greater access to psychology and law research and greater impact within the\nlegal system (Monahan & Walker, 1993). 270\nTherapeutic jurisprudence has also been offered as a paradigm for psychology and the law research (see\nWexler & Winick, 1996). Therapeutic jurisprudence examines the role of the law as a therapeutic agent\nand intends to produce research that is more relevant to legal reform. The intent is to uncover how\npsychology can shape the development of the law or the degree to which the law encourages the\npsychological and physical well being of individuals with which it comes into contact (Slobogin, 1996).\nTopics may include how the legal system influences the treatment of perpetrators of domestic violence\n(Simon, 1995), how the legal limitation of client-patient privilege impacts the therapeutic potential\n(Klotz, 1991), how fault-based compensation improves the recovery from personal injuries (Shuman,\n1994), the impact of a normative focus on sexual predators (Schopp, 1995), and improvement in legal\ncounseling (Patry, Wexler, Stolle, & Tomkins, 1998). The intent is to bring together social science\nresearch that may be seemingly unrelated and promote programs of research that focus on the\ntherapeutic impact of the law (Wexler & Winick, 1996).\nResearchers in psychology and law have also called for an increase in comparative scholarship examining\nthe discipline from an international perspective (Carson & Tomkins, 1997). They point to the dearth of\nresearch initiated by those outside of the United States (examples of international scholarship include\nAllan & Louw, 1997; Freckleton, 1997; Fulero & Turner, 1997) especially compared to other fields such\nas medicine (see Carson & Tomkins, 1997). A heightened awareness of research in other countries is\nespecially relevant to psychology and law because the impetus for many of our research agendas are\nderived from the legal system; a system that is far from universal. Outside of the \"Commonwealth\"\ncountries (e.g., Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) adversarial legal systems are\nreplaced by the European notion of truth seeking. The fundamentally different systems of justice may\nrender comparative examinations of psychology and the law difficult; however, the infusion of new\nideas, methodologies, and alternative approaches to address psychological aspects of the law are likely\nto open the discipline to a host of ideas and greatly enhance the field for future investigators (Carson &\nTomkins, 1997).\nBeginning Research in Psychology and the Law\nThe comparative youth and development of the field and its relevance to real world problems make\npsychology and the law increasingly attractive to students. This popularity lead to a national conference\nintended to evaluate the training that students at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels\nreceive and to propose more effective models (see Bersoff et al., 1997). Conference participants\ngenerally endorsed five areas they found to be integral to training in psychology and law: they identified\na core knowledge in the basic areas of psychology, firm knowledge of research design and statistics,\nlegal knowledge, foundational courses in legal psychology, and participating in original research and\nscholarship as fundamental to sound training in law and psychology (Bersoff et al., 1997). These basic\nareas provide a useful framework for beginning researchers in law and psychology. It is clear that a basic\nknowledge in psychological principles and methodology is imperative. Moreover, knowledge in\npsychology and law along with the law specifically is critical. However, the conference did not specify\nthe method by which such training should take place.\nThe most obvious manner in which one can receive training in psychology and the law is through\nspecifically designed programs. Such opportunities include psychology programs that offer the\nopportunity to specialize in psychology and law as well as specifically designed joint-degree programs\noffering degrees in both psychology and the law. There are a number of universities that offer specialty\ntraining in psychology and law culminating solely in the PhD (e.g., University of Alabama, University of\nBritish Columbia, Florida International University, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Kansas, 271\nUniversity of Nevada-Reno, Queen's University, Simon Fraser University, St. Louis University, University\nof Texas at El Paso, and the University of Virginia). There are also programs that offer a terminal\nMaster's degree (e.g., Castleton State College, John Jay College, University of Denver). In addition, there\nare several universities that formally offer joint JD/PhD training (e.g., Allegheny University of the Health\nSciences-Villanova University, University of Arizona, and University of Nebraska); one PsyD/JD Program\n(Widener University) (Bersoff et al., 1997; Ogloff et al., 1996). The University of Nebraska and Stanford\nUniversity also offer abbreviated legal training culminating in the Masters' in Legal Studies (MLS) and a\nPhD.\nBoth the specialty options and the joint-degree programs offer advantages and disadvantages. A joint\ndegree offers a broader exposure to areas of the law that are under-represented, the special credentials\nmay assist a student in obtaining certain employment opportunities, and many individuals argue there is\nsomething special about the simultaneous exposure to training in the law and psychology (Hafemeister,\nOgloff, & Small, 1990). The joint-degree programs usually take longer because of the additional degree\nand require additional motivation from the student, increase the cost to the student, and particular\ncareer opportunities may eliminated by obtaining the joint degree (see Melton et al., 1998, for a fuller\nexplanation).\nWhatever reasons a student pursues either joint-degree training or specialized training, it is clear that a\nsolid foundation in basic methodology, statistics, and courses in psychology are important before\npursuing graduate training and while pursing graduate training in law and psychology (Bersoff et al.,\n1997). Many undergraduate institutions offers specific courses on psychology and law. Students should\nbe encouraged to enroll in these courses but not feel that they are at a distinct disadvantage if their\nuniversity does not offer a course in psychology and law or forensic psychology. If such a course is not\noffered at your particular institution, students should approach a professor and request a special\nreadings course in psychology and law. In addition, undergraduate students should be encouraged to\nget involved in psycholegal research with a faculty sponsor. Though any research experience is\ninvaluable for admission to graduate school, exposure to a particular area of the literature that may\nhave only been briefly summarized here can be important for a number of reasons. It gives the student\nexposure to the most current research in a particular psycholegal area, allows him/her to evaluate\nwhere their psycholegal interests actually may lie, and gives them first hand exposure to the\nmethodologies that may be specific to psycholegal research and their implementation in a particular\nproject. Student should also be encouraged to join professional organization such as the American\nPsychology-Law Society (AP-LS) where they can receive a subscription to Law and Human Behavior with\ntheir membership. AP-LS has established at web page (http:www.unl.edu/ap-ls) that contains\nmembership information and additional details on law and psychology. AP-LS holds a biennial\nconference offers any interested students a broad exposure to the field that can be invaluable in terms\nof sparking interest or focusing it.\nConclusion\nIt was my intent to touch on some of the important topics of research in psychology and law as well as\nidentify important issues for researchers in the next century. The breadth and richness of the questions\nthat remain unexamined in this area of psychology are remarkable. Students intent on pursuing a career\nin the more experimentally focused areas of research or the more applied areas of the field such as\nforensic assessment are likely to have a rewarding future ahead of them. Now is a time both when\npsychology is beginning to realize the impact it can have on the law and society; and the law is beginning\nto realize that psychology may have something to offer it. 272\nReferences\nAmerican Board of Forensic Psychology and American Psychology-Law Society (1995).

Halgin\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst\nAt a social gathering of fellow graduate students in the early 1970's a heated debate erupted about the\ncause of mental illness. On one side of the argument were my antagonists who insisted that all\nbehavior results from learning, and that it is reasonable to conclude that psychiatric disturbances result\nfrom unfortunate life experiences. With an air of disbelief, I challenged my colleagues with pointed\nquestions. Do people learn the symptoms of schizophrenia? If so, how and why? Are the euphoric\nepisodes of mania conditioned responses? It just didn't make sense to me to view all mental disorders in\nterms of behavior theory. Although I didn't realize it at the time, this friendly disagreement would serve\nas a foundation block upon which I would build a career devoted to understanding the causes of mental\ndisorder and the treatment of people with various forms of disturbance. During this past quarter\ncentury I believe that I have expanded my knowledge about mental disorders and treatments. Yet, as I\nprepare to venture into the new century I realize that I still have so much more to learn. I also realize\nthat many of the seemingly brilliant research findings of earlier decades now seem unsophisticated and\nat times erroneous. I wonder where the fields of psychopathology and intervention will be twenty five\nyears from now.\nAs any good soothsayer will attest, predicting the future is not an easy task. People who are proficient at\nspeculation are usually those who have a good grasp of the present and an astute understanding of the\npast. In this chapter, I will attempt to venture some educated guesses about the future of\npsychopathology by considering the current state of the field, while also being sensitive to theories and\nhypotheses that were viewed as tenable in the recent past. I find it helpful to take a critical look at\nbeliefs that once seemed reasonable but are now regarded as facetious. For example,\npsychopathologists of the 1970s delineated psychotic mental disorders as either 'functional' or 'organic.'\nIn DSM-II (American Psychiatric Association, 1968), schizophrenia was listed in a section entitled\n'Psychoses Not Attributed to Physical Conditions.' Although the authors of DSM-II did not offer\netiological hypotheses regarding the cause of disorders such as schizophrenia, the notion was widely\nheld at the time that people could develop this disorder from being raised by a 'schizophrenogenic\nmother.' In fact, in the debate with my friend, he pointed to this notion in support of his premise that\nlife experiences are sufficient for explaining the development of even the most severe forms of\ndisturbance. I wish that I could revisit that debate now that thousands of research studies have led\npsychopathologists to replace such ill-founded theories with hypotheses that give biology a central role\nin many etiological explanations.\nTheoretical Perspectives\nPsychopathology research is presently at an interesting turning point, with the emergence of biology as\none of the defining factors in the etiology of many disorders. However, as we will see, biology rarely tells\nthe whole story; rather, most disorders arise from a complex set of factors. Integrative approaches that\nbring together biological, psychological, and social influences are emerging as the tools with which\npsychopathologists are constructing tenable theories and clinicians are developing effective treatments\nfor the new millennium. The term 'biopsychosocial' aptly captures the essence of this integrative\nperspective. 287\nThe diathesis-stress model is an important foundation block upon which biopsychosocial approaches are\nbuilt. This model proposes that people have a predisposition, or diathesis, that places them at risk for\ndeveloping a mental disorder. Presumably this vulnerability is genetic, although some theorists have\nproposed that the vulnerability may also be acquired very early in life as the result of certain life events,\nsuch as traumas, diseases, or birth complications (Zubin & Spring, 1977).\nIn order to appreciate the complexity of this integrative perspective, it is helpful to take a look at the\nmultifaceted state of the contributing subfields. In the following sections, I will discuss the current views\nof biologists, psychologists, and other social scientists regarding the causes and treatments of mental\ndisorders.\nThe Biological Perspective\nStudents in psychopathology courses are usually able to understand the connection between aberrant\nbodily and emotional functioning by considering the connection in their own experience between\ncertain psychological phenomena and physical events in the body. For example, they know that going\nwithout food or sleep for extended periods can cause emotional havoc; a high fever can evoke\nhallucinations; ingested substances can provoke psychotic-like symptoms. During the past decade\nadvances in biological psychiatry have opened many doors to understanding the ways in which\npsychological functioning is affected by the nervous system, the endocrine system, and genetics.\nIn the realm of nervous system research, promising clues to understanding mental disorders have\nemerged from studies of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid,\ndopamine, norepinephrine, enkephalins, and serotonin. For example, during the past decade, special\nattention has been given to serotonin, which researchers now realize is involved in a variety of disorders\nincluding obsessive-compulsive disorder, mood disorders, and eating disorders. In the decade to come,\nresearchers will certainly intensify their efforts to understand some of the ways in which\nneurotransmitters cause people to act, think, and feel in ways that others regard as abnormal.\nResearchers will also expand their inquiry into the role of the endocrine system in causing mental\ndisorders. In what ways do hormones cause people to act and feel abnormally? Astute clinicians\nrecognize the importance of conducting assessments that are sensitive to this question. For example,\nresearchers have proposed that certain 'stress' hormones become activated in cases involving\nmelancholic depression, leading to the experience of anxiety and fearfulness (Schulkin, 1994). Experts\nalso know that many people with mood disorders have abnormal levels of thyroid hormones, leading\nthem to speculate about the relationship between rate of metabolism and the occurrence of manic or\ndepressive symptoms (Sokolov, Kutcher, & Joffe, 1994). As we venture toward the next century, an\nincreasing number of disorders will be explained in terms of endocrinological dysfunction. It is\nconceivable that clinicians will be able to use hormonal testing to predict the onset of some\npsychological problems months or years before the emergence of symptoms.\nGenetic make-up is yet another biological determinant of mental disorder. Polygenic models of genetic\ninheritance have been proposed to explain the ways in which many genes participate in the process of\ndetermining behavioral characteristics. Scientists have developed sophisticated procedures for\nestimating heritability in their efforts to assess the extent of genetic influence on various characteristics.\nEven though genetic influences have been shown to play a prominent role in the determination of\nseveral disorders, such as schizophrenia and mood disorder, experts realize that these genetics do not\ntell the entire etiological story. Using a diathesis-stress approach, researchers have begun to make 288\nquantitative estimates of the relative contributions of genes and the environment to the development\nof a mental disorder (Buchsbaum, 1994). As genetic research becomes more sophisticated in the years\nto come, clinicians may be able to make predictions, perhaps prenatally, about the statistical likelihood\nof an individual becoming psychologically disordered.\nAs biological research continues to advance, and more precise modes of predicting the development of\nmental disorders emerge, experts in the fields of psychopathology and intervention will face many\nprofound ethical and social dilemmas. Should we tell the 18-year-old young woman that she is destined\nto develop major depressive disorder twenty years from now? Should we inform the 50-year-old man\nthat a decade hence he will be suffering from Alzheimer's Disease? Moving beyond the issues of\npredicting and informing, researchers in the field will be driven to formulate preventive measures so\nthat the 18-year-old woman and the 50-year-old man can go through their lives unburdened by the\nfrightening scenarios that would otherwise be portrayed. Perhaps medications or psychosurgical\nprocedures will be developed that can change the course of bodily development for people carrying\nbiological predispositions for mental disorders.\nThe Psychological Perspective\nIn recent decades psychopathologists have moved away from reliance on narrow theories to explain the\netiology and treatment of psychological disorders, and have moved toward integrative models that tap\nthe empirically validated contributions of divergent schools of thought. Tapping various models,\nincluding psychodynamic, behavioral, humanistic, and family systems, astute clinicians develop\nformulations and treatment plans from a multitheoretical perspective (Halgin, 1989).\nA few decades ago there were many psychotherapists who spoke ardently about the effectiveness of\nparticular clinical techniques, while discrediting the benefits of other approaches. Behaviorists and\npsychoanalysts commonly demeaned the efforts of each other, and humanistic therapists ridiculed the\ntechniques of both these models. During the second half of the20th century, thousands of research\nstudies have failed to demonstrate conclusively the superiority of any single model. In fact, in a meta-\nanalysis of outcome psychotherapy studies, Wampold and his colleagues (1997) concluded that the\nefficacy of bona fide treatments is roughly equivalent. Perhaps this growing realization has been\ninfluential in the choice of increasing numbers of therapists to explain and treat mental disorders by\nturning to the tenets and techniques of more than one model. As Norcross (1997) noted, 'informed\npluralism and psychotherapy integration are the Zeitgeist of the new millennium' (p. 86).\nIn order to understand the psychological aspects of mental illness, we turn to the major theoretical\nmodels that have been influential during the past several decades including psychodynamic, behavioral,\nand family systems. Although relatively less influential in the recent past, humanistic approaches have\nadded a valuable dimension as well.\nPsychodynamic Contributions\nPsychoanalysis has been broadened and reformulated in recent decades to such an extent that\nadherents are more likely to use the label psychodynamic and to include a wide range of concepts to\nexplain and treat mental disorders. Particularly prominent among the contributions of psychodynamic\nadherents is the emergence of object relations theory and technique. Object relations theorists have\nproposed that various mental disorders arise from an individual's failure to form an integrated self early 289\nin life because of disturbed or inadequate relations with a primary caregiver. Researchers adapted the\nconcept of infant attachment style to understand the ways that individuals relate as adults to significant\nothers in their lives (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Hazan & Shaver, 1994). Such investigations opened\ndoors to understanding emotional problems that involve pathological interpersonal styles in adulthood\n(Sable, 1997). Experts also applied attachment theory to psychotherapy by incorporating the tenets of\nthis approach into clinical interventions with various kinds of clients suchas disturbed families, bereaved\nindividuals, and distressed children (Biringen, 1994). When working with an especially hostile client, for\nexample, an object relations clinician would give particular attention to the client's early experiences\nwith caregivers in an effort to understand how the individual developed such a distancing interpersonal\nstyle.\nRecognizing that the traditional techniques of long-term psychoanalysis are not viable in the\ncontemporary clinical world, clinicians have adapted some psychodynamic tenets in the development of\nshort-term models of intervention. Binder, Strupp and Henry (1995) formulated time-limited dynamic\npsychotherapy (TLDP) in which the psychotherapeutic process is viewed as a set of interpersonal\ntransactions in which 'the therapist uses the relationship with the patient as the primary medium for\nbringing about change' (p. 53). In TLDP change comes about through the 'recognition of patterns of\ninteractions with others that continuously reinforce maladaptive attitudes and feelings about oneself\nand others' (p. 54).\nBehavioral and Cognitive Contributions\nBehaviorally based models of understanding and treating mental disorders generated considerable\nexcitement as theorists moved beyond the narrow behaviorism of the first half of the 20th century and\nformulated innovative approaches, such as social learning, cognitive-behaviorism, and behavioral\nmedicine, during the latter decades of the century. Social learning theorists demonstrated the ways in\nwhich maladaptive behaviors are learned through observing other people being reinforced for engaging\nin those behaviors. For example, children raised by violent parents are likely to model violent behavior\nwhen they are frustrated. Social learning principles, such as those pertaining to modeling, can be applied\nin situations in which the observation of healthy and appropriate behavior is particularly important. For\nexample, children can be taught to manage stressful situations by observing others dealing effectively\nwith potentially upsetting circumstances.\nWithin cognitively based approaches, theorists emphasized the central role that thought processes play\nin the acquisition and treatment of various disorders. During the 1980s and 1990s many behaviorists\nredefined their approach as cognitive-behavioral or simply 'cognitive' (Craighead, Craighead, Kazdin, &\nMahoney, 1994), thereby emphasizing the thoughts and unobservable processes that determine\nbehavior. The cognitive approach developed most comprehensively with efforts to understand and treat\ndepression (e.g., Beck, 1991; Ellis, 1998), but impressive advances were also achieved in the realm of\nanxiety disorders (Barlow & Brown, 1998; Steketee, 1998). What is particularly exciting about the work\nof cognitive-behaviorists is the notion that many symptoms, previously viewed as uncontrollable by the\npatient, have been brought under control by teaching individuals ways to change their thoughts and\nthereby change maladaptive emotions. As a result of the efforts of cognitive behaviorists, clinicians can\nlook beyond antianxiety and antidepressant medications in formulating treatments for various\nconditions. For example, Barlow and Brown (1998) comment that the psychosocial treatment of panic\ndisorder is one of our profession's success stories. The refinement of cognitively based approaches in\nthe years ahead should add to the excitement generated by those professionals who have\ndemonstrated ways of using the powers of the mind to resolve emotional and behavioral dysfunction. 290\nBehavioral medicine is an approach in which clinicians combine behavioral, cognitive, and physiological\ntechniques in the treatment of many medical conditions. As the line that divides medical and\npsychological intervention becomes increasingly blurred, the benefits of behavioral medicine will\nbecome even more evident. For example, experts recognize the fact that many physical conditions, such\nas heart problems, respiratory difficulties, pain conditions, and even cancer can be exacerbated by stress\nand alleviated by behavioral and cognitive-behavioral methods. The emerging field of\npsychoneuroimmunology has focused attention on the connections among psychological stress, nervous\nsystem functioning, and the immune system. Although it is a common response to turn to medication\nfor the relief of medical problems, in the years ahead investigators will strive to tap the inner curative\npowers that play such an important role in personal health.\nFamily Systems Contributions\nThe family perspective developed in the late 1960s within the emerging framework of systems theory\n(Haley, 1976). The underlying premise of this perspective is that the individual's personality is\ninseparable from the pattern of interactions and relationships within the family. Within this view,\ndisturbance may arise from disturbed communication patterns in the family, problematic family\nstructure, or dysfunction in the family system. For example, a man's alcoholism may be understood, not\njust as his problem, but rather as a problem in which all the family members play a role in maintaining\n(Rohrbaugh, Shoham, Spungen, & Steinglass, 1995). Adherents of this approach support interventions\nthat involve all those in the system; so rather than treating just the individual, they involve all the\nmembers of the family.\nParticularly challenging for family systems theorists is the changing definition of the American family. As\nwe approach the next millennium, clinicians will be confronted with challenges of understanding and\ntreating problems within the contexts of families that differ from previous family structures involving\ntwo biological parents. Single-parent households are becoming more common, especially among some\ngroups such as African Americans (Heaton & Jacobson, 1994). It is also more common to find children\nbeing raised by gay couples, grandparents, or others with the responsibilities once held almost\nexclusively by two biological parents. Divorce has become so common in American society that the\nblended family comprised of children from two or more marital relationships is becoming commonplace.\nFamily researchers and clinicians will devote increasing attention to the impact of new family structures\non psychological development as they strive to develop interventions that are responsive to a changing\nAmerican family.\nHumanistic Contributions\nAlthough few psychopathologists would suggest that humanistic psychology plays a central role in\ncontemporary approaches to understanding and treating psychological disorders, the client-centered\ntechniques of Rogers and the self-actualization theory of Maslow have had a lasting impact on the work\nof many clinicians. For example, Hans Strupp (1997), one of the most prominent psychotherapy\nresearchers of the century notes that 'irrespective of its theoretical underpinnings, psychotherapy is\nanchored in, and fundamentally inseparable from, a human relationship' (p. 92). Effective clinicians\nrecognize that techniques per se are meaningless unless there is a working alliance between the helper\nand the client.\nAs I think about the ways in which psychological theorists have contributed to the understanding and\ntreatment of people with mental disorders, I am reminded of why I chose to pursue a career in clinical 291\npsychology rather than medicine. I have always been drawn to the curative powers of the human\nrelationship. As I noted above, I recognize that biological contributions play an important roles in\nhelping clinicians understand and treat mental disorders; at the same time, it is my belief that the most\npowerful medications in the world are limited in efficacy unless accompanied by a therapeutic\nrelationship. In the years to come, I hope to continue to investigate the curative powers of the working\nalliance between client and clinician, with more focused attention to the specific aspects of a clinician's\ninterpersonal style that are most important in helping clients derive therapeutic benefit.\nThe Sociocultural Perspective\nThe racial demographics of American society have changed drastically over the past several decades,\nand psychopathologists are recognizing the importance of viewing mental disorder through lenses that\nare sensitive to cultural differences. As the fabric of society changes, so also must definitions of mental\ndisorder and interventions that are culturally sensitive. In a diverse society, experienced clinicians know\nthat they must be broad in their understanding of ethnic and cultural contributions to mental disorder.\nThere is considerable potential for bias in the assessment and treatment of people from groups who\nhave not been members of the majority in society. For example, in the realm of psychological testing\nand assessment, experts have exhorted mental health professionals to develop '...more culturally\nsensitive ways of assessing individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds' (Suzuki, Meller, &\nPonterotto, 1995, p. 680).\nWhen diagnosing people from minority groups, it is imperative that clinicians attend to issues of cultural\nidentity. DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) provides a systematic outline for attending to\ncultural issues in the diagnostic and treatment process. This approach prompts clinicians to consider the\ndegree of involvement with the client's culture of origin, possible cultural explanations for the problem,\nand the ways in which the problem may be explained or interpreted within the individual's cultural\nframework.\nAlthough advances have been made in sensitizing clinicians to the importance of attending to cultural\nissues in assessment and diagnosis, Casas (1995) contends that much more work is needed in the\nintervention realm. He points out that efforts have been made to revise traditional theories in order to\nincrease their effectiveness with racial/ethnic minority groups, but many of these efforts have lacked a\nconnection to theory or validation by means of controlled experimentation. In the decades to come,\nresearchers and clinicians must sharpen their focus on these complex issues in order to respond to a\nsociety whose complexion, language, and cultural heritage will continue to change.\nUnderstanding and Treating Mental Disorders\nIn addition to broad theoretical advances and refinements, we can also expect specific developments in\nhow particular mental disorders are understood and treated. In this section I focus on several major\ndiagnostic categories and offer some hypotheses about future directions that are informed by emerging\ntrends.\nPersonality Disorders\nPersonality disorders involve long-lasting patterns of inner experience and behavior in which\nmaladaptation is evidenced by disturbance in at least two of the following realms: (a) cognition, (b) 292\naffectivity, (c) interpersonal functioning, and (d) impulse control. This pattern is a rigid aspect of the\nindividual and is pervasive in most situations of a person's life. People with these disorders are likely to\nsuffer from intense inner distress or problems in most aspects of their life.\nThis group of disorders is comprised of a range of maladaptive personality patterns including paranoid,\nschizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-\ncompulsive personality disorder. What factors distinguish these various conditions? This question is\nactually a central concern to researchers who study people with personality disorders. One of the most\nfrustrating aspects of research on the topic of personality disorders is the lack of sharp distinctions\nwithin this group. In other words, diagnostic reliability and validity are problematic, leading to wide\nranges of estimates of prevalence for several of these disorders. In the past, researchers have used\nvarious criteria in defining personality disorders and have relied on imprecise assessment instruments.\nConsequently, there is considerable diagnostic overlap among the disorders.\nResponding to the fuzzy diagnostic situation of the recent past, some researchers have embarked on an\nambitious journey to redefine the field by focusing on the relationship between personality disorders\nand what are referred to as the Big Five factors of personality. The Big Five consists of five broad factors\nof personality ' extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to\nexperience. As Dyce (1997) noted in his review of relevant studies, interest in this approach has\nintensified of late, even though the Big Five have been identified for nearly half a century. Instead of\nplacing individuals into artificial discrete categories, proponents suggest a dimensional approach in\nwhich personality characteristics are viewed along a continuum ranging from normal to abnormal. A\npersonality disorder would represent an extension of a set of normal personality traits that have\nexceeded an empirically determined level (Livesley, Schroeder, Jackson, & Jang, 1994; Millon, 1994;\nWidiger, & Ford-Black, 1994).\nIn the decades to come, investigators will strive to capture the essence of personality disorders as they\nmove away from simplistic categories on which we have relied to capture a complex set of intrapersonal\nand interpersonal characteristics. Dyce (1997) contended that researchers will augment the Big Five with\nattention to nonpersonality factors, such as cognitive distortions, dysfunctional beliefs, and personal\nevaluations.\nPsychopathologists will also intensify efforts to understand how and why people develop these\nmaladaptive patterns. Central to such investigations will be exploration of spectrum models in which\ncertain maladaptive patterns will be linked to other clinical conditions currently beyond the boundaries\nof the personality disorders category. For example, the hypothesized link between schizotypal\npersonality disorder and schizophrenia may become clearer, as will the relationship between borderline\npersonality disorder and mood disorder.\nBiology is certain to provide a prominent clue to solving the puzzle of personality disorders. Researchers\nwill determine with greater precision some of the ways in which the brain of a personality disordered\nindividual differs from that of a person without this maladaptive pattern. For example, for decades\ntheorists have been convinced that the brain of a person with antisocial personality disorder is\nsomehow different from the norm. It has been presumed that these individuals have certain\nneuropsychological deficits that are reflected in abnormal patterns of learning and attention. But what\nare the differences, and what are their causes? Studies of family inheritance patterns have provided\npreliminary evidence in support of the heritability of criminality and psychopathy (Nigg & Goldsmith,\n1994). 293\nThe study of early life experiences has also yielded clues to understanding the development of\npersonality disorders. Of particular importance has been the effect of abuse and trauma on the\nemergence of a disturbed personality in adulthood (Millon, 1998). As the horrors of childhood abuse\ncontinue to come to light, we are more capable, sadly enough, of understanding what might lead so\nmany people to lives of inner torment and interpersonal dissatisfaction. Even though a cause and effect\nrelationship seems apparent, caution is imperative when drawing conclusions. As Paris (1997) asserts,\n'Life events are rarely the cause of any mental disorder. At best, they are risk factors for\npsychopathology.' (p. 34) He points out that reliance on retrospective designs is a limitation of all studies\nof trauma in personality disordered patients. He urges researchers to examine the impact of trauma in a\nmultidimensional framework.\nIn addition to the biological and interpersonal contributors to personality disorder, it will be important\nto consider societal influences. Millon (1998) attributes the increased prevalence of conditions such as\nborderline personality disorder to 'broad and pervasive sociocultural forces' (p. 19). He contends that\nwhen society's values and practices are fluid and inconsistent, as he regards them to be in contemporary\nWestern culture, people are more likely to develop deficits in psychic solidity and stability.\nWithin the biopsychosocial framework, researchers will attempt to refine the understanding of\npersonality disorders by zeroing in on the fabric and functioning of the nervous system, the role of early\nlife experiences, and the impact of societal change. Clinicians treating personality-disordered individuals\nwill turn to the findings of these researchers in their attempts to provide sound treatment.\nAnxiety Disorders\nAnxiety, a normal part of human experience, becomes a source of clinical concern when it reaches such\nan intense level that it interferes with a person's ability to function in daily life. Intense, irrational, and\nincapacitating experiences form the basis of anxiety disorders. Included in this group are the conditions\nof panic disorder, agoraphobia, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder,\nand generalized anxiety disorder.\nAlthough this category shares the common feature of inordinate anxiety, the group is oddly\nheterogeneous when it comes to etiology. For example, it is a widely held notion that certain anxiety\ndisorders, such as panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, are genetically loaded conditions\nwith measurable physiological correlates (Pini, Goldstein, Wickramaratne, & Weissman, 1994). On the\nother hand, post-traumatic stress disorder is by definition a reactive condition in which an individual\nexperiences an incapacitating response to a stressful life event (Meichenbaum, 1998).\nAlthough the causes of the anxiety might differ, its manifestation in the various anxiety disorders is both\nphysiological and emotional. In other words, people suffering a panic attack experience intense physical\ndiscomfort associated with shortness of breath, hyperventilation, dizziness, choking, heart palpitations,\ntrembling, sweating, stomach distress, and so on. Researchers have long suspected that changes in the\nbody trigger the sensation of panic. These changes may be the result of an underlying biochemical\nabnormality that may be inherited. For example, certain individuals with panic disorder seem to have\nhigher levels of brain lactate, a normal bodily chemical whose production can be stimulated by such\nbehaviors as aerobic exercise. And, Papp and his colleagues (1997) demonstrated that patients with\npanic disorder are abnormally sensitive to the anxiety producing effects of CO2 inhalation. 294\nEven though the role of biology in understanding and treating anxiety disorders has been a central focus\nof some researchers, it would be naive to conclude that we could solve the puzzle of anxiety disorders\nby looking solely at body chemistry. During the past two decades David Barlow and his colleagues have\nchanged the way mental health professionals understand what goes on in the whole organism of a\nperson tormented by anxiety. Barlow and Brown (1998) have gone beyond the biochemistry of anxiety\nand have focused on the cognitions of a person with an anxiety disorder. Recognizing the fact that panic\nattacks represent brain or biochemical dysfunction, which can be activated by CO2 inhalation or\ninjection of sodium lactate, Barlow and his colleagues focused on the individual's response to these\nsubstances as influenced mainly by psychological factors. As a result of extensive research, Barlow\nconcluded that 'strong evidence exists that anxiety focused on future panic and the sensations\nassociated with panic combine as a strong force in maintaining panic disorder' (p. 51).\nA multitheoretical approach also makes sense for the other anxiety disorders. For example, physiological\ncorrelates of obsessive-compulsive disorder have been evident for years. Since the 1800s it has been\nknown that obsessions and compulsions exist in people with neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and\nParkinson's disease. Nearly a decade ago Judith Rapoport (1989) noted the connection between\nneurological conditions involving the basal ganglia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and she has\nfocused on the relationship between serotonin and OCD symptoms. More recently other researchers\n(Robinson et al., 1995) have found anatomical differences in brain structure that suggest malfunctioning\ncircuitry in the connections between the subcortical and cortical motor control centers. At the same\ntime that advances have been made in understanding the biology of OCD, other researchers have\nprogressed in their understanding of the psychology of the condition. Steketee (1998) has developed\nbehavioral interventions involving exposure to feared obsessions and prevention of rituals that\naccompany the obsessions, and she has demonstrated impressive effectiveness of these psychological\ntechniques. In fact, she notes that she would only bring in serotonergic medications prior to behavioral\ntreatment with 'clients who have difficulty engaging in exposure treatment because their anxiety or\ndepressed mood is extremely high' (p. 69). Steketee's work highlights the fact that for some conditions,\ntherapeutic change can be achieved by helping clients use their own behavior-changing resources.\nDissociative Disorders\nThe category of dissociative disorders is comprised of dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue,\ndepersonalization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. These disorders involve anxiety or conflict\nso extreme that part of the individual's personality becomes separated from the rest of conscious\nfunctioning. The person with a dissociative disorder experiences a temporary alteration in consciousness\ninvolving a loss of personal identity or decreased awareness of immediate surroundings. These\nconditions have fascinated mental health professionals for most of the 20th century and have generated\nconsiderable debate among those who study and treat people with dissociative disorders.\nThe phenomenon of dissociation, especially in the form of dissociative identity disorder, has been at the\nheart of tremendous controversy in recent years (Waller & Ross, 1997). Experts have debated the\nvalidity of the diagnosis. Prior to DSM-IV this condition was called multiple personality disorder. The\nlabel was changed to dispel some of the misunderstandings associated with the term 'multiple\npersonality' (Hacking, 1995). Once considered an extremely rare clinical condition, diagnosis of this\ndisorder became commonplace during the final few decades of the century. In the 50 years prior to\n1970 only a handful of cases had been reported, but since 1970 there have been thousands of reports.\nSome experts maintain that the increase in reported prevalence of multiple personality is due to more\naccurate diagnosis of the disorder. On the other side of the debate are individuals who maintain that the 295\nincrease in diagnosis can be attributed to the notoriety of several popular first-person characterizations\nand media attention. Spanos (1994) asserted that this condition had become a way for some people to\nunderstand and express their failures and frustrations, and a tactic for manipulating others for some\nattention and concern.\nThe debate over the validity of dissociative identity disorder intensifies when the topic of its relationship\nwith childhood abuse is brought into the discussion. Researchers have noted that most clients with\ndissociative identity disorder report experiences of having been physically or sexually abused as\nchildren. Compounding the issue, however, are questions about the reliability of some recollections of\nchildhood abuse. The most intense controversy in recent years has focused on the phenomenon of\nrecovered memories, especially those that emerge during the course of psychotherapy (Bowers &\nFarvolden, 1996). Alarm has been expressed about the potential that some psychotherapists\ninadvertently plant the suggestion that an individual might have been exploited as a child. As Bowers\nand Farvolden (1996) note, 'we know now that suggestions of various kinds can powerfully alter belief,\nbehavior, and memory' (p. 375). Just as clients may be led to believe that unremembered traumatic\nevents actually occurred, they may also be led to believe that they have more than one personality.\nOn the other side of the debate are experts, such as Richard Kluft, who endorse the increased\nprevalence of dissociative identity disorder, but define the diagnosis much more broadly than the classic\ndefinition. Kluft (1998) contends that most individuals with dissociative identity disorder have\ndissociative experiences that are not evident to others; only a very small percentage show dramatic\nbehaviors that would be symptoms of disturbance obvious to other people.\nLooking toward future research on this diagnosis, Waller and Ross (1997) assert that the overinclusive\nuse of the term dissociation has hampered efforts to understand the etiology and course of the\ndissociative disorders. They believe that 'progress in dissociation research will accrue much faster after\ninvestigators distinguish between normative and pathological dissociative states' (p. 508). Also needed is\nadditional study of the processes of memory and the residual effects of early trauma.\nSexual Disorders\nThe category of sexual disorders is comprised of sexual dysfunctions, paraphilias, and gender identity\ndisorders. During the 20th century psychologists made significant advances in understanding and\ntreating sexual dysfunctions through the pioneering efforts of Masters and Johnson, and Helen Singer\nKaplan. Particularly impressive have been integrative efforts in which clinicians blend divergent\ntechniques in the treatment of people with sexual dysfunctions. For example, Kaplan (1998) brought\ntogether psychodynamic and behavioral work in the interventions she recommended. She also\npromoted a refreshing perspective on sexual problems, viewing neither person in a partnership as the\npatient; rather she believed that when conducting sex or marital therapy it is important to realize that it\nis their 'relationship that is ailing and needs to be healed' (p. 141).\nAs we approach the 21st century, there is less concern with the treatment of sexual dysfunction than\nthere was two decades ago, but much greater attention to the paraphilias which involve the\nvictimization of other people. There is no behavior in contemporary society considered more troubling\nthan pedophilia. The sexual assault of any person, especially a child, is considered an extreme deviation\nfrom the standards of acceptable behavior in our society, and vigorous investigative efforts are under\nway to understand what leads people to engage in such exploitation. 296\nWith increasingly sophisticated understanding of the causes of sexual aggression, experts face the\ndaunting task of developing intervention programs that alter the behavior of aggressors. Hall, Shondrick,\nand Hirschman (1993) promote differential treatments geared to the type of aggressor. For example,\nthey contend that some individuals should be treated with physiological interventions, such as\ncastration, hormonal treatments, and aversion therapy, while others would benefit from cognitive\ninterventions such as victim empathy training.\nEssential to the discussion of how society should respond to pedophiles is the issue of incarceration\nversus treatment. In American society, imprisonment is almost universally mandated, both because of\nthe legal violations involved, and the revulsion of society to the behavior of the perpetrator.\nUnfortunately, no compelling evidence has emerged to support the notion that time in jail reduces the\nlikelihood of sexually deviant behavior. As ineffective as incarceration may be, efforts to define effective\ntherapeutic interventions have been limited in success.\nSome medical interventions proposed for the treatment of pedophiles and other sexual perpetrators\nhave created controversy which must be resolved in the years to come. Castration was a widely used\ntreatment for sex offenders in the 1960s in European countries, but rarely used in the United States.\nAnother invasive surgical intervention has involved psychosurgery in the form of hypothalamotomy, or\ndestruction of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. This procedure is intended to change the\nindividual's sexual arousal patterns by targeting the source of these patterns in the central nervous\nsystem. In most places surgery has been replaced by other alternatives, such as medication (Berlin,\n1997; Marshall, Jones, Ward, Johnston, & Barbaree, 1991).\nPrimary among the goals for dealing with sexual aggressors is the development of preventive strategies\nthat reduce, ideally eradicate, this form of unacceptable behavior. Perhaps risk factors can be delineated\nsuch that parents, educators, and mental health professionals might accurately predict which young\npeople are at greatest risk of moving toward this paraphilia in adolescence and adulthood. In the best of\nall worlds, corrective measures could be introduced before the problem emerges.\nIn reality, prevention will be only partially successful, and society will face the challenging questions of\nhow to respond to people who are so intrusive in the lives of those less powerful. Mental health experts\nmay be called upon to develop biological alterations for paraphilias that are far more extreme and long-\nlasting than any somatic interventions currently in use today.\nMood Disorders\nMood disturbance is a clinical condition with which every person can relate. At some time or other every\nperson feels depressed, and many people experience symptoms to a degree sufficient to meet the\ncriteria of major depressive disorder. Out of every 100 people, approximately 13 men and 21 women\ndevelop this disorder at some point in life (Kessler et al., 1994). Bipolar disorder is much less common\nthan major depressive disorder; only 1.6 percent of Americans developing this condition at some point\nin life. Nevertheless, the lives of these individuals are thrown into chaos that warrants serious clinical\nattention.\nThe study of mood disorder etiology has yielded some of the most compelling findings about the role of\ngenetics. The observation that mood disorders run in families is now well-established (Klein et al., 1995;\nWinokur, Coryell, Keller, Endicott, & Leon, 1995). Even in the case of suicide, genetic make-up seems to 297\nplay a powerful role, as demonstrated by some carefully conducted twin research studies (Roy, Segal, &\nSarchiapone, 1995).\nResearch on the biochemistry of mood disorder is still in a developmental stage, as investigators\ncontinue to sort out the role of various neurotransmitters. Focus has broadened beyond concern about\ncatecholamines such as norepineprhine and dopamine to include attention to indolamines such as\nserotonin. Researchers are also looking at neuroanatomical differences, such as blood flow within the\nbrain, in people with mood disorders such as depression (Bench, Frackowiak, & Dolan, 1995).\nWith all the excitement surrounding findings about the biological causes of depression, there is a risk\nthat the importance of psychological and social factors will be underestimated. Attention has been\ndrawn away from the fact that many people become seriously depressed in reaction to upsetting life\nevents. Cognitive theorists, such as Aaron Beck, Donald Meichenbaum, and Albert Ellis, have been\ninfluential in emphasizing the role of disturbed thinking processes in the development and maintenance\nof depression. In the words of Ellis (1998), '...people largely depress themselves by taking their strong\ndesires for success and relationships and irrationally raising them to absolute musts and demands' (p.\n175). Ellis has taken an interesting integrative stance in which he acknowledges the possible causative\nrole of biology in determining depression; however, he goes a step further by pointing out that people\nwith endogenously caused depression may 'denigrate themselves for being depressed' (p. 176) and\nconsequently develop low frustration tolerance.\nSeveral researchers have focused on the powerful impact of disturbed interpersonal relationships in the\nlives of depressed people. Interpersonal theorists (Weissman & Markowitz, 1994) developed a model of\nunderstanding mood disorders that integrates several components. They take into consideration early\nlife experiences that set the stage for intimacy and personal happiness later in life. Connecting the ideas\nof psychoanalytic theorists with behavioral and cognitive theorists, they look at the ways in which\nchildhood failure to develop satisfying intimate relationships may lead to adult experiences of despair,\nisolation, and resulting depression.\nTurning to the topic of therapeutic intervention for mood disorders, an increasing number of mental\nhealth professionals have turned to somatic interventions as components of a treatment plan. Although\na minority of practitioners relies exclusively on medication to treat patients with serious depression or\nbipolar disorder, most recognize the importance of attending to interpersonal and emotional issues in\ntreatment.\nIn the realm of medication, the advent of selective serotonin erupt inhibitors (SSRI's), such as Prozac,\nhas revolutionalized the treatment of depression and several other disorders. In his 1993 book, Listening\nto Prozac, Peter Kramer caught the attention of millions of readers with his suggestion that Prozac need\nnot be reserved for people diagnosed with depression. According to Kramer, Prozac (and similar\nmedications) can quickly and easily help people with other conditions, such as low self-esteem or\nsensitivity to depression. Americans are apparently heeding this advice, as evidenced by annual sales of\nProzac in excess of 700 million dollars (Standard & Poor's Industry Survey, 1995). The implications of\nsuch widespread prescription of this 'miracle drug' are difficult to assess, but there seems little question\nabout the fact that countless numbers of people are seeking psychological changes and are finding that\nmedications help them make life more pleasant. Will the daily SSRI dose become as commonplace as the\nmorning vitamin? 298\nIn this pursuit of a panacea substance, Americans have also turned to herbs. Receiving special attention\nof late is the herb hypericum perforatum, more commonly known as St. John's Wort (Wills, 1996). In\nGermany St. John's Wort is prescribed much more widely than Prozac, and European researchers have\nfound it to be more effective than placebo and as effective as mainstream antidepressants with fewer\nside effects (Klaus et al., 1996). With such promising results, we are led to wonder whether future\ntreatment for mood disturbance will be found in one's garden or pantry.\nIn addition to the medical use of prescriptive substances, some practitioners are relying more and more\non the incorporation of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of mood disorders. For several\ndecades this intervention was used only in the most extreme cases because of negative public attitudes\nand images of ECT. That has changed considerably during the 1990s, such that some practitioners\nactually recommend 'maintenance' ECT in which the treatment is administered over a period of several\nmonths to prevent recurrence of depressive symptoms (Steibel, 1995). For several years, practitioners\nwere especially concerned about the possibility that long-lasting adverse effects might result from\nrepeated administration of ECT; however, recent research reports have not provided grounds for such\nconcern (Barnes, Hussein, Anderson, & Powell, 1997). Of continuing concern, however, for many\npractitioners and patients is the fact that the mechanism of the antidepressant action of ECT remains\nunknown, although vigorous investigative efforts have been undertaken to explain what happens in the\nbrain as a result of this treatment (Werstiuk, Coote, Griffith, Shannon, & Steiner, 1996).\nIn the decades to come, the greatest promise for finding a widely accepted treatment for mood disorder\nwould seem to lie in those interventions that can be self-generated efforts to change biological bases of\nmood. As evidence emerges in support of the therapeutic benefits of diet and exercise, people may take\nincreasing control over their own emotions through behavioral changes that influence the biochemistry\nof the brain.\nSchizophrenia\nA profoundly disturbing and complex mental disorder, schizophrenia is a form of psychosis that causes\nhavoc in the lives of people who suffer from this disorder and their family members. Between one and\ntwo percent of Americans have schizophrenia, but the resources needed to care for those whose lives\nare disrupted by this disorder are tremendous.\nOf central importance in professional discussions about this disorder are questions about the nature of\nschizophrenia. Like several other conditions we have already discussed, schizophrenia is coming to be\nunderstood dimensionally rather than categorically. The notable dimensions include positive-negative\nand process-reactive. The most striking symptoms of schizophrenia are the 'positive' symptoms, such as\ndelusions, hallucinations, disturbed speech, and disturbed behavior. However, experts have increased\ntheir attention to negative symptoms that involve functioning that is below that regarded as normal,\nsuch as emotional unresponsiveness, deficient communication, and loss of motivation. The process-\nreactive dimension differentiates schizophrenia according to how symptoms emerge ' either during a\ncourse of gradual deterioration or in reaction to stressors.\nImplicit in questions about the dimensions of schizophrenia are questions about the definition of this\ndisorder, a definition that has evolved considerably during the past century. Is schizophrenia a singular\ncondition with many facets or a set of different but related disorders? As mentioned above, current\nthought leans toward the notion of a schizophrenia spectrum, with the psychotic expression of 299\nschizophrenia being related to conditions, such as schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal\npersonality disorder.\nAfter many decades of research on the etiology of schizophrenia, investigators have more certainty\nabout the biological bases of this disorder than can be said about most other mental disorders. Experts\nare clear about the fact that the brains of people with schizophrenia differ from those of others, but\ninvestigators continue to lack certainty about the precise differences. As Stevens (1997) has noted, the\nsearch for an anatomy of schizophrenia has engendered an enormous mass of data, yet 'no\nmorphological or microscopic abnormality has been found that is either necessary or sufficient for the\ndiagnosis' (p. 373). In response to the heterogeneous biological picture of schizophrenia, experts are\nmoving away from trying to understand this disorder as a single condition, but rather they are focusing\ntheir attention on symptom complexes to guide future neuroanatomical investigations (Buchanan &\nCarpenter, 1997).\nAs they continue their pursuit for an accurate biological characterization of schizophrenia, investigators\nwill also try to pin down what causes the biological differences. Tremendous efforts have been made to\ndefine the genetics of schizophrenia transmission, yet thousands of questions remain. Family patterns of\nindividuals with schizophrenia provide convincing evidence for genetic determinants. The closer a\nrelative is to an individual with schizophrenia, the greater the concordance. For example, the highest\nconcordance rate, 48%, is found in identical twins. However, the fact that the rate is not 100% leads to\nthe conclusion that genetic influences cannot tell the whole story. In the years to come, researchers will\ntry to understand what protects slightly more than half of the twin-siblings from developing the\npsychosis of their identical twin. By means of complex family studies involving efforts to separate out\nthe role of biology from environment, investigators will continue their inquiry. Through such methods as\nthe assessment of biological markers and genetic mapping, they will try to understand what goes on in\nthe mind and the body of a person who develops this disturbing disorder. In other words, what is the\ndiathesis and what are the stressors? It seems reasonable to expect that within a decade experts will be\nable to predict with a fair amount of certainty the odds of developing schizophrenia. They should also\nhave a good grasp of what might increase an individual's vulnerability and what protective steps might\nbe taken to reduce this vulnerability.\nThe realm of intervention for schizophrenia presents many challenges as well. Excitement has grown\nsince the advent of such new antipsychotic medications as clozapine, a serotonin blocker that works on\nthe neurotransmitter systems but has a different biochemical mode than traditional neuroleptics. The\nuse of clozapine has increased substantially since the Food and Drug Administration approved it in 1990\nand has been enthusiastically welcomed by the 10 to 20 percent of people with schizophrenia whose\nsymptoms were unaffected by the other antipsychotic medications. Because major medical risks have\nbeen associated with clozapine use, pharmaceutical companies have worked diligently to develop\nsimilar medications that involve less risk. In the years to come, experts will continue to refine the\nformula for pharmacological interventions that are effective in quieting the tormenting symptoms of\nthis disorder.\nEven with the most effective of pharmacological interventions, experts recognize that psychological\ninterventions will also be needed. At the very least, people who have been emotionally and behaviorally\ndisturbed for years will need help readjusting to life once their symptoms are reduced or eradicated. In\naddition to social and family interventions, some therapists are promoting 'personal therapy.' In this\napproach, promoted by Gerard Hogarty and his colleagues, therapists strive to help schizophrenic\nindividuals notice their physical and emotional reactions to stress, so they can learn strategies for coping 300\nwith stress and relaxing in social situations. Research reports regarding the benefits of personal therapy\nhave been startling (Hogarty et al., 1997). This kind of success serves as an important reminder to\nclinicians working with schizophrenic individuals that medication provides symptom relief, but not cure.\nPeople with schizophrenia need a more comprehensive intervention that returns them to and retains\nthem in the mainstream of society.\nDevelopment-Related Disorders\nThe category comprising development-related disorders is large and diverse, consisting of conditions,\nsuch as mental retardation, autistic disorder, and learning disorders. Perhaps more than any other\ndevelopment-related disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has received the most\nresearch attention. This condition affects between 3% and 5% of the population and approximately 50%\nof clinical child populations (Cantwell, 1996). Children with ADHD are particularly intriguing to clinicians\nand educators both because of their deficits as well as their capacities. Some ADHD children are\nremarkably bright and charming; however, their lives are unhappy because they lack control over their\nown behaviors. The components of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity lead to a childhood or\nadolescence characterized by unhappiness and impaired functioning. Barkley and Edwards (1998)\ndescribe ADHD as a 'developmental disorder of self-regulation and future-directed behavior that\nadversely affects an individual's self-discipline, social effectiveness, and general adaptive functioning' (p.\n232).\nResearchers have worked earnestly to understand the biology of this disorder, with special attention to\nthe role of genetics. During the past decade there has been increasing evidence in support of a genetic\nmechanism underlying ADHD, although researchers have questioned the extent to which the condition\nis categorical or dimensional (i.e., clearly delineated vs. behavior along a continuum). Levy and her\ncolleagues (1997) support the notion that ADHD has an exceptionally high heritability compared with\nother behavior disorders; they contend that 'ADHD is best viewed as the extreme of a behavior that\nvaries genetically throughout the entire population rather than as a disorder with discrete determinants'\n(p. 737).\nIn the years to come, experts will more precisely define the factors that cause ADHD. To date, they have\nfocused attention on neurological deficits, genetics, birth complications, acquired brain damage,\nexposure to toxic substances, and infectious diseases. In addition to biological factors, they will attempt\nto understand the psychological contributors, such as the fact that individuals with ADHD are more likely\nto have grown up in a disturbed family environment (Biederman et al., 1995).\nControversy has emerged in recent years regarding the prescription of Ritalin (methylphenidate), a\nmedication that has been demonstrated as effective in treating ADHD symptoms. Giving young children\nmedication engenders mixed feelings in most parents, yet experts have demonstrated that most\nindividuals with ADHD experience therapeutic benefits from these medications in which symptoms are\nreduced and overall adjustment is improved.\nGreatest progress has been made in multifaceted treatments that involve work with the family,\neducators, and the child using behavior modification programs that are maintained for long periods,\npossibly years (Barkley & Edwards, 1998). Combining directive therapeutic interventions with\nmedication as needed has been shown to be the most effective way of bringing order to the lives of\nchildren who feel out of control. Challenges in the decade ahead pertain to the early diagnosis of ADHD 301\nand the introduction of educative strategies directed toward caregivers during the earliest stages of\nostensible ADHD behavior.\nAddictive Behaviors\nIt is no secret that the abuse of substances has reached crisis proportions in contemporary society.\nFindings from the National Comorbidity Study have revealed that Americans between the ages of 15 and\n54 are more affected by dependence on psychoactive substances than by any other psychiatric\ndisturbance (Anthony, Warner, & Kessler, 1994). Over one-quarter of the U.S. population have abused\nor been dependent on substances at some point in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 1994).\nMillions of dollars are being spent to determine why people abuse substances and how they should be\ntreated. The biopsychosocial model (Zucker, Howard, & Boyd, 1994) has been particularly valuable in\nexplaining the determinants of alcoholism. This model originated in part from longitudinal studies in\nwhich researchers followed individuals from childhood or adolescence to adulthood. The individuals\nmost likely to become alcohol dependent had a history of antisocial behavior, including aggressive and\nsadistic behavior, trouble with the law, rebelliousness, lower achievement in school, completion of\nfewer years of school, and more truancy. They also showed a variety of behaviors possibly indicative of\nsome type of early neural dysfunction, including nervousness and fretfulness as infants, hyperactivity as\nchildren, and poor coordination. These characteristics may reflect a genetically based vulnerability that,\nwhen combined with environmental stresses, leads to the development of alcohol dependence.\nChildren of alcoholic parents are likely to start their pattern of alcohol and drug use early in life, and by\nthe age of 12, about one-fifth show negative consequences of substance abuse or symptoms of\ndependency (Chassin, Pillow, Curran, Molina, & Barrera, 1993). In addition to the fact that early alcohol\nuse increases the likelihood of subsequent drug abuse, a person can develop a pattern of alcohol\ndependence by the early to mid-twenties that becomes fully established within two years\n(Langenbucher & Chung, 1995).\nMoving beyond the notion of biological vulnerability, researchers have also focused attention on\npsychological processes involved in the transition from social drinking to dependence (Stacy, Widaman,\n& Marlatt, 1990). According to the expectancy model, people acquire the belief that alcohol will reduce\nstress; will make them feel more competent socially, physically, and sexually; and will give them feelings\nof pleasure. Young people are understandably drawn to want such experiences. In one longitudinal\nstudy of young teens, researchers found those individuals with the highest expectancies for the\nfacilitating effects of alcohol began to drink earliest and heaviest, increasing their rate of drinking faster\nthan teens who did not have strong alcohol expectancies (Smith, Goldman, Greenbaum, & Christiansen,\n1995). This finding serves as a interesting segue into the social determinants of drinking behavior.\nAdvertisers know that effective marketing of alcohol involves highlighting the social desirability of\ndrinking. Drinkers are characterized as having fun, being relaxed, and being sexy, and are thus idealized\nas role models, especially for individuals who have only minimal experience of such pleasant feelings in\ntheir lives. As the social crisis regarding substance abuse continues to escalate, society will have to come\nto terms with the importance of finding less destructive pathways than psychoactive substances for\nachieving personal happiness and relieving inner psychological distress.\nCorresponding to the integrative approach to understanding the causes of substance abuse, clinicians\nhave recognized the importance of taking an integrative approach to the treatment of this problem.\nComplicating the treatment picture, however, is the fact that many individuals with a history of 302\nsubstance abuse also suffer from other mental and physical disorders. Schuckit (1998) highlights the\ncomplications that arise in the realm of dually diagnosed patients. He notes that 'one in three alcohol- or\ndrug-dependent people present for care with temporary symptoms that resemble other Axis I major\npsychiatric disorders' (p. 262). Schuckit emphasizes the importance of careful diagnosis in which a time\nline is established in which the clinician considers issues of symptom onset. He also points out the fact\nthat substance abusers are likely to suffer from one or more serious health problems that lead to the\nshortening of life from heart disease, cancers, suicide, and accidents.\nIn the realm of biological treatment of alcoholism, some clinicians have recommended the prescription\nof medications that are intended to alleviate symptoms of depression or anxiety. Schuckit (1998)\ncontends that for the average alcohol-dependent individual not suffering from clearly documented\nindependent depressive episodes, antidepressants are not particularly helpful. As for other medications,\nhe believes that at the present time efficacy reports are preliminary. Antabuse (disulfiram) is a\nmedication that is intended to produce a strongly aversive physiological reaction when a person drinks.\nUnfortunately, research on this medication has failed to demonstrate its widespread efficacy. Schuckit\nsees greater promise in the use of naltrexone (Trexan), an opiate antagonist. Clearly, much more\nresearch will be needed in the near future to determine which pharmacological agents are effective in\nreducing craving in people who are intensely addicted.\nThe greatest hope for effective intervention has been found in self-help contexts with Alcoholics\nAnonymous serving as a model for helping people who have lost control of their lives because of\nsubstance abuse. The 12 steps to recovery form the heart of AA's philosophy. The emphasis on honesty,\nconfrontation, and storytelling are seen as essential elements of the 12-step program (Khantzian &\nMack, 1994). Other important components of AA are the constant availability of people who can provide\nsupport during times of crisis and the spiritual element upon which the approach rests (Smith, 1994). It\nis difficult to generate data from controlled studies that self-help groups, such as AA, improve recovery\nrates, but clinical impressions certainly lead to such a conclusion (Schuckit, 1998).\nIn addition to the personal impact on the substance abuser of programs such as AA, supplementary\ninterventions that focus on the individual's family and social circle have evolved. For example, Al-Anon\nprovides support for people who are close to alcoholic individuals and who need help to cope with the\nproblems that alcoholism has caused in their lives. Al-A-Teen is specifically designed for teenagers\nwhose lives have been affected by alcoholism in the family.\nEven though biological, psychological, and social interventions show promise for ameliorating the\nterrible emotional and medical crises in the lives of substance abusers, these efforts have had minimal\nimpact on resolving the drug problem in society. The most important task for experts in the area of\nsubstance abuse pertains to the challenge of prevention. During the 1980s and 1990s federal, state, and\nlocal governments have poured millions of dollars into education and prevention programs directed at\nelementary and secondary school students. The DARE Program, the most widely tapped of these efforts,\nhas failed to bring about a reduction in the drug problem. In fact, researchers have been dismayed by\nthe finding that young people, who participated in this program a decade ago while in elementary\nschool, are using illicit substances at alarming rates (Murray, 1997). Researchers, clinicians, and\neducators are desperately looking for ways to bring about long-lasting attitude change in young people\nso that they will have the wisdom to avoid falling into the catastrophic danger zone of drug abuse.\nOther Psychopathological Conditions 303\nIn this chapter I focused on some of the major disorders that are of concern to researchers and clinicians\nin the field of psychopathology. Because of space limitations, it is not possible to discuss all the major\nconditions in the field despite the fact that tremendous advances are taking place in the way that\ncertain disorders are understood and treated. Brief mention of some significant trends is warranted.\nIn the category of cognitive disorders, psychologists are giving increasing attention to research\nendeavors on conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease. All signs are pointing toward the likelihood that in\nthe beginning years of the new millennium researchers will finally grasp the causes for this debilitating\ndisorder of the brain. Methods are likely to be found that will suspend the deterioration that takes place\nand possibly even recover some of the capacities that are lost. Other forms of dementia will also be\nbetter understood. It is possible that the vigorous research efforts on various forms of dementia, such as\nthat commonly found in people with AIDS, will lead to greater understanding of various forms of\ncognitive impairment. For the time being many clinicians working with patients suffering from dementia\nare focusing efforts to alleviate the emotional burden borne by caregivers who tend to loved ones\nafflicted by severe cognitive disabilities (Zarit & Zarit, 1998).\nThe category of eating disorders presents yet another challenge for researchers and clinicians. An\nalarming number of young people, mostly girls, have become entangled in patterns of eating\ndisturbance with devastating, often fatal, consequences. Biopsychosocial approaches will serve as the\nmeans for deriving an explanation for what takes place in the body, mind, and social world of people\nwho become caught up in a life characterized by dangerously self-destructive behaviors associated with\neating. Experts in this area will continue their efforts to demonstrate how interventions such as\ncognitive-behavioral techniques can bring about demonstrable improvement in individuals whose lives\nhave been ravaged by eating disorders (Agras & Apple, 1998).\nAdvice to Aspiring Psychopathologists\nEach semester when I teach undergraduate courses in abnormal psychology students turn to me for\nrecommendations about possible career paths related to the study of people with mental disorders.\nThese students ask for pragmatic advice ranging from the kind of graduate study to pursue to the\nspecific undergraduate courses they should take. My suggestions are rooted in the integrative approach\nthat I have used to discuss the mental disorders in this chapter.\nOf special importance to the aspiring psychopathologist is a sophisticated understanding of the human\nbody. Beginning with the brain, it is essential to know the structure and functioning of the control center\nof human functioning. Advanced study of neuroscience provides tremendously important tools for\nunderstanding human behavior. In addition to focused study of the brain, the wise student studies all\nother major systems of the body. For example, knowledge of the endocrine system is essential for an\ninvestigator studying certain forms of mood disturbance. An appreciation for the emotional correlates of\nmedical conditions, such as diabetes, allergies, and circulatory disease, can alert a researcher or clinician\nto the multifaceted causes of problems that might seem emotionally caused.\nIn recent years, psychologists have been debating the issue of whether they should have prescription\nprivileges. This debate has been intense with proponents arguing that the prescription of medication\nwill be an essential function in the work of a clinician. On the other side are those who are committed to\nmaintaining the field of clinical psychology as one that focuses on cognitive, emotional, and\npsychological phenomena rather than biological and medical functions. In my view, these latter\narguments are naive. As we come to grips with the fact that biological and psychological phenomena are 304\ninseparable, clinicians must be prepared to intervene somatically. Aspiring psychologists should be\nprepared for these modes of intervention and should be trained in procedures that involve the\nintegration of somatic and psychotherapeutic interventions. If I were starting out today, I would still\nchoose clinical psychology over medicine, but I would be certain to learn the most current information\nin the fields of physiology and psychopharmacology.\nIn addition to a strong foundation in the study of biological aspects of mental disorder, clinicians need to\nhave sound training in the major psychological perspectives. This goal can be achieved by means of\ncareful study of the history of psychology in which students develop a grasp of the tenets of the major\nschools of thought, with special attention to the contributions of the psychodynamic, behavioral, family\nsystems, and interpersonal approaches. However, they will need more than academic study. The\naspiring clinician needs hands-on experience working with different kinds of clients, using a variety of\ntherapeutic techniques, in a diversity of settings. Those who are committed to working exclusively with\nadult clients in individual therapy should be certain to have training experiences involving the treatment\nof children, couples, and families. Those committed to working within a behavioral paradigm should look\nfor opportunities to obtain supervision within a more exploratory framework. Through such broad\nexposure, they will gradually develop their own personal style, and in the process, learn the kind of\nclinical approach that works for their clients and that provides a sense of personal satisfaction for\nthemselves.\nIn the decade ahead, I will continue to conduct research that I have recently initiated that focuses on\nhelping trainees assess 'clinical style,' the qualities of personality and interpersonal interaction that\nenhance or impede their work with clients. This research begins by having the trainee characterize his or\nher therapeutic style along various dimensions (e.g., directive vs. evocative, educative vs. interpretive,\nconfrontative vs. supportive). In addition to self-characterization, data about the trainee's clinical style\nare collected from supervisors and clients, as well as outcome measures, such as ratings of client\nsatisfaction and clinical benefit. In this research, we will strive to help clinicians develop a greater\nunderstanding of the relationship between clinical style and effectiveness in general, as well as\neffectiveness with certain kinds of clients. My advice to aspiring clinicians is that they begin the process\nof self-assessment well before entering the field. In addition to intensive personal reflection, they may\nbenefit from a personal therapy in which they explore their motivation for pursuing this career and give\nconsideration to personal attributes that may enhance or impede their clinical work.\nMy research on clinical style takes place within a changing psychotherapeutic climate that is being\ndefined by changes in the marketplace associated with the expansion of managed care health systems.\nIncreasing emphasis is being placed on effectiveness and efficiency of interventions. For example,\ninsurance companies are calling upon clinicians to use only empirically supported treatments in their\npractice. In response to such calls, leaders in the field of psychology have been working to formulate\ntreatment recommendations called 'practice guidelines' (Nathan, 1998). Not surprisingly, these efforts\nhave unleashed a storm of controversy, primarily because much of the research upon which these\nguidelines were formulated took place in laboratory rather than realistic clinical contexts. As the debate\ncontinues, educators are struggling with decisions about the content and techniques of psychotherapy\ntraining curricula. What is overlooked in many of these discussions is the personality and style of those\nproviding clinical services. As we approach the new millennium, the onus will be on the educators of\naspiring clinicians to respond to the challenges imposed by exciting new scientific findings about mental\nillness, inspiring data about innovative interventions, and powerful changes within health care delivery\nsystems (Halgin, in press). At the same time we must realize that the clinician and his or her personal 305\nstyle will continue to be central factors in the equation. Imaginative research will be needed to\nunderstand the nature of this fascinating equation.\nFinally, as we approach the 21st century, psychopathologists and clinicians need to understand our\nsociety and the forces and pressures that affect people adversely. The fields of sociology, and\nanthropology for that matter, provide important clues for solving pressing problems in the field. For\nexample, researchers in the field of eating disorders know that they must attend to societal pressures on\nteenage girls in developing theories and interventions. In a multicultural society, clinicians are\nrepeatedly called upon to explain phenomena and treat people within social contexts about which they\nhave limited understanding. As the fabric of society changes, so also must the training and sensitivity of\nprofessionals. Those entering the field must make a determined effort to become educated about\npeople whose backgrounds differ from their own. I urge my students to look for opportunities to meet\nand learn about people from other religious, ethnic, cultural, or socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition\nto social and educational pursuits, they should look for work contexts within which to expand their\nunderstanding about people.\nWhen students ask me if I would follow the same career path if I had to do it over, I tell them that I am\ncertain that I would. I have been fascinated over the past quarter century by my work with hundreds of\nclients whose lives I have tried to change for the better. In addition to facilitating changes in their lives, I\nhave experienced change in my own life as a result of my work with these clients. I have developed a\ngreater appreciation of the complexities of human nature. I have refined my clinical style so that I now\nhave a better sense of what is helpful to my clients and with which kinds of clients I am most effective.\nAnd I have come to understand myself a great deal more ' my strengths, my limitations, my biases, and\nmy sensitivities. I urge those beginning their careers to prepare for an exciting but arduous journey on\nwhich they will encounter an explosion of knowledge about human nature and abnormal behavior. On\nthis journey they are certain also to learn a great deal about themselves. I urge them to engage in the\nkind of debates that excited me early in my career and to open themselves to evolving areas of\ninvestigation.\nReferences\nAgras, W. S., & Apple, R. F. (1998).

Purdy, Southwestern University and\nMichael Domjan, University of Texas at Austin\nPeople have an abiding fascination with animals. Zoos and animals trained for entertainment have been\npopular for centuries. More recently, nature shows dealing with animal behavior can be seen on TV\nvirtually any time of day, and pet ownership is at an all-time high. Animals can be fun, interesting, and\nemotionally satisfying. They can also provide important information about learning and cognition and\nthe evolution of behavior. This kind of information can, in turn, provide important insights into what it\nmeans to be human. Scientists who have a personal fascination with animals can translate that interest\ninto studying comparative psychology and animal learning and end up knowing more about the human\nanimal as a result.\nA Personal Odyssey\nI (JEP) have been interested in science and nature most of my life. In high school I told my biology\nteacher I wanted to become a marine biologist and study the behavior of marine mammals. The teacher\ninformed me that career opportunities in marine biology were nonexistent and suggested I become a\nphysical oceanographer instead. After my first physics course in college, however, I decided to major in\npsychology. I discovered my passion in two courses, Experimental Psychology and the Psychology of\nLearning. I enjoyed designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data and I enjoyed thinking about\nthe various theories of learning and how they might be tested. The instructor in Experimental\nPsychology was Dr. Henry A. Cross who conducted experiments with animals. Dr. Cross was a learning\ntheorist who worked with rats at the time but had also conducted experiments with monkeys under the\ndirection of Harry Harlow. What could be better, I thought, than to study animal learning and behavior\nin a controlled experimental setting?\nI volunteered to work in Cross's laboratory and was delighted when he agreed. I was fascinated with the\nlaboratory. In one study we examined the frustration effect; in another experiment we examined\nwhether frustrative nonreward would stimulate alcohol intake. I worked in Cross's laboratory for three\nyears before enrolling in graduate school. I counted myself lucky when Dr. Cross accepted me into his\nPhD program at Colorado State University.\nSince becoming a faculty member at Southwestern University, I have been able to combine my interests\nin animal learning, animal behavior, comparative psychology, marine environments, and marine life.\nSince 1981, I have conducted experiments with a variety of aquatic animals including bass, bettas, carp,\ncichlids, crabs, cuttlefish, goldfish, koi, minnows, paddlefish, salmon, and shrimp,. The experiments have\ndealt with predator/prey interactions, basic learning phenomena including behavioral contrast and\nappetitive and aversive sign tracking, and problems in optimal foraging theory. I have also taken\nstudents to Northern Vancouver Island where we have observed killer whales and recorded their\nvocalizations related to foraging. During the summer of 1999, at the Bamfield Marine Station on\nVancouver Island, British Columbia, we played back those sounds and others to salmon to determine\ntheir effects on salmon behavior. Plans are being made to extend the work in the summer of 2001.\nI have come full circle since high school. I am not a marine biologist studying the behavior of marine\nanimals, but I am a psychologist doing virtually the same thing. I am able to teach and conduct research 313\nin a laboratory, and when necessary for my personal sense of well being I am able to get away for 'field\nresearch.' A couple of months on an uninhabited island observing killer whales is good therapy. If you\nvalue nature, constantly wonder how things work, and are interested in questions about the brain and\nintelligence, comparative psychology may be for you. It also helps to have an abiding love and\nappreciation for nonhuman animals.\nRemarkable Anecdotes\nAs one watches animals, it doesn't take long before one sees things that appear to reflect highly\n'intelligent' behavior. In a lecture presented at Southwest Texas State University a number of years ago,\nDr. Roger Fouts described the following conversation between a lab assistant and a chimpanzee that\nhad learned sign language: As the lab assistant entered the chimp's living quarters, the chimp signed\n\"Bring me orange.\" At this request, the assistant went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and\ndiscovered that there were no oranges. She returned to the chimp and signed \"No orange.\" The chimp\nimmediately signed with increased vigor, \"Bring me orange.\" The lab assistant signed \"No orange.\" The\nchimp, becoming agitated, signed again for an orange. The assistant, near despair, went to the\nrefrigerator, opened it, looked at the chimpanzee and signed \"No oranges.\" At this point, the\nchimpanzee signed, \"You drive, bring me orange.\"\nAlthough most of us have not conversed with chimpanzees, we have all observed or heard about\nepisodes that appear to show remarkable intelligence in animals. Aristotle may have been the first to\nuse anecdotes to argue for intelligence in nonhuman animals. In the History of Animals, he wrote: \"In\nthe neighborhood of Lake Marotis, it is said, wolves act in concert with the fishermen, and, if the\nfishermen decline to share with them, they tear the nets to pieces as they lie drying on the shores of the\nlake\" (Barnes, 1984).\nAnecdotes like these are fascinating, but what do they tell us about the cognitive abilities of nonhuman\nanimals? Unfortunately, very little. Anecdotes provide captivating descriptions of behavior but the\nconclusions they imply are without proof. The wolves in Aristotle's story may have torn up the fishing\nnets for a number of reasons having little to do with revenge. Perhaps they were attracted by the smell\nof fish on the nets and chewed on the nets after a poor catch left them hungry. Only systematic\nexperimentation with control groups can tell us why animals do the interesting things they do. The\nanecdotal method cannot accomplish that.\nThis chapter examines the approaches taken by scientists interested in comparative psychology and\nanimal learning. Since both disciplines are rooted in Darwin's ideas about the evolution of morphological\nand psychological traits, we begin with a discussion of evolutionary theory and early considerations of\nthe evolution of intelligence. We also describe the influence of ethology and Tinbergen's four questions.\nIn the second part of the paper, we consider the current status of work in comparative psychology and\nanimal learning. In the third and final section, we comment on where research on comparative\npsychology and animal learning are headed. Included in the last section is a bit of practical advice to\nstudents who are interested in going into comparative psychology and animal learning.\nHistorical Antecedents\nFrom Charles Darwin to C. Lloyd Morgan\nModern studies of comparative psychology and animal learning have their origins in the work of Darwin\nand Romanes in the late nineteenth century (see Bornstein, 1980; Gottleib, 1979). Both Darwin and\nRomanes rejected the assumption that human mental life was unique and argued instead for continuity 314\namong animal species. Darwin became convinced that nonhuman animals had the same emotions and\nmental abilities as people (see Darwin's The Descent of Man and Expression of Emotions in Man\nAnimals). He proposed that the difference was quantitative not qualitative. Humans had more powerful\nintellects and a greater capacity for emotional restraint.\nRomanes, who coined the term 'comparative psychology,' foresaw a field of psychological inquiry that\ncompared the mental life of animals with human mental life (Romanes, 1884). Romanes saw a great\nfuture for comparative psychology. He believed that every known species of animal possessed intellect,\nand he argued that the actions of primitive species, in parallel with the homologues of biological\nstructures, had their counterparts in the intelligent behaviors of more complex species, most notably in\nhumans.\nRomanes, and others before him, made liberal use of anecdotal evidence to support their claims.\nUnfortunately, the informality of anecdotes, and their inaccessibility to verification, makes them of little\nscientific value. Indeed, after the publication of Romanes's book Mental Evolution in Man, the use of the\nanecdotal method was seriously discredited (Waters, 1934). Guided by 'Morgan's Canon,' comparative\npsychologists adopted more rigorous empirical methods.\nMorgan highlighted the dangers inherent in attempting to think about animals using anthropomorphic\nhuman terms. He pointed out that in comparisons between human and animal mental life, there was a\ntendency to ascribe to animals mental abilities that animals may not possess. He proposed a guiding\nprinciple to avoid this mistake: 'In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of\na higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands\nlower in the psychological scale' (Morgan, 1901, p. 53). Morgan's Cannon is one of the fundamental\naxioms of modern comparative psychology.\nThe Influence of Experimental Psychology\nOne of the major issues that interested early comparative psychologists was the evolution of\nintelligence. However, before they could study the evolution of intelligence, they had to decide what\nconstitutes intelligence in animals. The definition early comparative psychologists settled on provided\nthe impetus for the study of animal learning (see Domjan, 1987). Intelligence was defined in terms of\nbehavioral plasticity and the ability to learn or to benefit from one's experiences. Armed with this\ndefinition, investigators began to study the evolution of intelligence by examining learning in nonhuman\nanimals.\nE. L. Thorndike was one of the first to apply a rigorous scientific methodology to the study of learning.\nFor his doctoral dissertation, he invented the puzzle box technique, which allowed him to track the\nprogress of learning by measuring changes in the latency of his subjects to escape from a box. Thorndike\nstudied learning in cats, chickens, dogs, fish, and monkeys. In interpreting his findings, he rejected\nanthropomorphic concepts and formulated the Law of Effect, which explained learning in terms of the\nacquisition of S-R associations (Thorndike, 1911). Thorndike was one of the giants of early comparative\npsychology. The apparatus he developed for the study of learning (the puzzle box experiments), his strict\nmethodology, and the negative conclusions he drew regarding the presence in animals of ideas,\nreasoning, and imitation learning all served to legitimize comparative psychology as science (Waters,\n1934).\nThe Influence of Ethology 315\nWith research on learning, comparative psychology gained a predominantly experimental and\nlaboratory flavor. However, comparative psychology also was heavily influenced by ethology (Jaynes,\n1969). The term 'ethology' was coined in 1859 by Isidore Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, who advocated studying\nthe behavior of animals in their natural habitats (Jaynes, 1969). This led ethologists to focus on\nnaturalistic observations. The approach was systematized by Konrad Lorenz, Karl von Frisch, and Niko\nTinbergen, who later shared the Nobel Prize for their efforts. Tinbergen (1951, 1963), in particular,\nspelled out the agenda that guides much of the contemporary research in comparative psychology.\nThe Ethogram. Tinbergen argued that the scientific study of animal behavior must begin with careful\nobservation and description. We cannot explain why an animal acts in some fashion until we know the\nanimal's ordinary activities. For Tinbergen, the description of behavior was a serious business. Its\nultimate aim was 'an accurate picture of the patterns of muscle action' (Tinbergen, 1951, p. 7).\nTinbergen championed the use of still and motion pictures, as well as careful study of the muscles\ninvolved in a particular behavior. In describing social interactions, he advocated concentrating on those\nbehaviors in one animal that caused behavioral reactions in the other animal.\nIdeally, description results in a complete inventory of the behavior patterns of a species. This is called\nan ethogram. The ethogram can then be used to formulate questions about the causes of behavior.\nHowever, Tinbergen cautioned against moving to causal issues before a complete ethogram had been\nobtained. A study by Baerends (1941) illustrates the strategy. Baerends observed that digger wasps dig a\nhole in the ground, kill or paralyze a caterpillar, place the caterpillar in the hole, and lay an egg on the\ncaterpillar. Having laid an egg in one nest, the wasp repeats the entire sequence with other nests. After\nseveral nests have been set up, the wasp returns to her first nest where the larva has hatched and brings\nthe larva additional caterpillars. The wasp then moves on to the second nest, and so on. Finally, the\nwasp returns again to the first nest and this time provides six or seven additional caterpillars. She then\ncovers the nest and leaves it forever. The entire sequence is played out over an eight-day period, with\nthe wasp keeping up with as many as five different nests.\nHow does the wasp know how much food to bring to each nest? Baerends changed the number of\ncaterpillars in the nest by either adding or removing some and found that the number of caterpillars the\nwasp saw on her first visit of the day to a particular nest determined how many caterpillars she brought\nto that nest that day. If Baerends removed some of the caterpillars before the first visit, the wasp would\nbring extra ones; if Baerends added caterpillars, the wasp would bring fewer than the usual number.\nChanging the number of caterpillars after the first visit of the day did not influence the wasp's behavior.\nThis study attracted considerable attention because it showed that a wasp could remember what it saw\non the first visit to a nest for at least 15 hours. This was remarkable because people at the time thought\neven orangutans could not remember things for more than about 5 minutes (Maier & Schneirla, 1935).\nTinbergen was fond of the wasp study because it showed that with careful observations, and by studying\nan animal in its own habitat, one can discover remarkable mental abilities, even in the lowly wasp.\nAfter observation and description of an animal's behavior under natural circumstances, one can begin to\nexamine the causes of the behavior. Tinbergen (1951, 1963) pointed out that the causes of behavior can\nbe approached from four different perspectives. These have come to be known asTinbergen's four\nquestions: 1) How does the behavior develop during the animal's life time, or what is the ontogeny of\nthe behavior? 2) How does the animal's immediate environment activate the physiological mechanisms\nthat generate the behavior, or what are the proximal mechanisms of the behavior? 3) How does the\nbehavior contribute to survival and reproductive success, or what is the adaptive significance of the\nbehavior? 4) What is the evolutionary history or phylogeny of the behavior? 316\nBehavioral Ontogeny. The ontogeny question focuses on how behavior is determined or 'caused' by the\nprogression of events that occur during an animal's life. Tinbergen considered three primary causal\nfactors in this category: maturation, practice, and learning. Maturation refers to growth processes, in\nreceptors, effectors, and the nervous system. Maturation can lead to the emergence of new forms of\nbehavior without specific practice. In contrast, practice effects refer to improvements in an existing\nbehavior brought about by mere repetition of that behavior (or of similar activities).\nLearning involves a relatively permanent change in behavioral patterns that occurs as a result of\nexperience. How learning phenomena interact with maturational and other processes was of particular\ninterest to ethologists. Tinbergen (1951) reported, for example, that parent gulls will accept any chick\nthat enters the nest during the first 5 days after their chicks hatch. After that, however, the parents will\nneglect chicks that were not in the nest earlier, and may even kill them. Evidently, parent gulls learn the\nidentity of their offspring during the first 5 days after their chicks hatch.\nAnalogous individual recognition learning does not seem to occur during incubation. Although gull eggs\ndiffer in color, size, and speckling pattern, incubating hens will accept strange eggs with impunity.\nLearning during the incubation period seems to be focused on information identifying the spatial\nlocation of the nest. If an experimenter removes the eggs from an established nest and places them a\nfew feet away, the gull may continue to sit on the empty nest in full view of the displaced eggs.\nThe fact that gulls learn about the spatial cues of their nest but not the identity of their eggs makes\nsense in terms of their natural habitat. During the incubation phase, the hen leaves the nest periodically\nto obtain food or to scare off or decoy predators, after which she has to be able to find her way back.\nOrdinarily the location of the eggs and the nest does not change. On the other hand, once the chicks\nhatch, they soon become mobile. Therefore, the hen has to be able to distinguish her chicks from those\nof neighboring hens. These differences in what the gulls learn about at different stages of their\nreproductive cycle illustrate what Tinbergen called special 'dispositions to learn' (Tinbergen, 1951, p.\n145). Such specializations in learning remain of considerable contemporary interest (e.g., Domjan,\n1997).\nProximate Mechanisms or Immediate Causation. The second question posed by Tinbergen concerns\nimmediate causation or the proximate mechanisms of a behavior. To identify immediate causes, it is\nimportant to know what external and internal stimuli are available to the animal. Weakly electric fish,\nfor example, are able to produce and perceive slight changes in an electrical field. These animals use\nchanges in electrical fields to detect prey, conspecifics, and mates, and to regulatetheir dominance\nhierarchies (Hopkins, 1977). Most other organisms, including humans, cannot perceive these subtle\nchanges in electric fields. Given the contrasting sensory worlds of diverse species, Tinbergen (1951)\nnoted that investigations of sensation and perception are critical to the study of immediate causation.\nNumerous investigations have addressed the external causes of behavior. Tinbergen referred to one\nclass of stimuli that cause behavioral patterns to be emitted as sign stimuli or releasing stimuli. Such\nstimuli release species typical response patterns. For example, Gallup (1974) examined tonic immobility,\nwhich appears to be an innate response that evolved as a defense against predation (Ratner, 1967).\nDuring a period of tonic immobility, or death feign, the animal becomes immobile in response to some\naspect of the predator. Gallup and his co-workers were able to show that the death feign response in\nchickens was released primarily by visual presentation of the eyes of a predator. Even artificial eyes\nmounted on wooden dowels and directed at young chickens produced the tonic immobility response\n(Gallup, Nash, & Ellison, 1971). The eyes of a chicken hawk, the red breast of a robin, the red belly of a\nstickleback fish are all examples of external stimuli that elicit certain behaviors. 317\nAdaptive Function. Tinbergen viewed organisms as living in an extremely unstable state and advised\nscientists to examine how particular behavior patterns aid survival. This question is not as easy as it\nseems at first glance. Different species solve problems related to survival in different ways. For example,\npigeons drink water by sucking whereas most other birds drink water by scooping. Both behaviors are\nadaptive, and one is no better than the other in an absolute sense. The difference between them is best\nexplained by the evolutionary history of the species involved. Sucking and scooping are convergent\nsolutions based on different evolutionary histories. Tinbergen (1951) suggested that the 'study of\nconvergences helps to show up adaptiveness.'\nTinbergen (1963) distinguished between questions of adaptive significance and immediate causation in\nthe following manner. Immediate causation examines the preceding events that contribute to a\nbehavior. In studying immediate causation, the researcher looks 'back in time' to determine why an\nanimal behaves in a particular fashion. In contrast, in studying adaptive function, the researcher looks\n'forward in time' to determine how a particular behavior contributes to the animal's survival or\nreproductive success. Questions of adaptive significance are more difficult to answer because the\nresearcher has to compare how one behavior, structure, or learned event actually increases\nreproductive success or survival over another behavior, structure, or learned event.\nEvolutionary History. Tinbergen (1951) noted that studies of the evolution of behavior have lagged far\nbehind studies of the evolution of morphological traits. This is probably because describing behavior is\nmore difficult than describing morphology. Distinguishing between innate differences in behavior versus\nacquired differences is often also difficult, and behavior is not well represented in the fossil record.\nHowever, studying fossilized animal tracks (Seilacher, 1967), examining the structure and type of\nenvironment in which the fossil was found, and identifying fossilized bones found in the stomachs of\nfossilized animals can tell us much about the behavior patterns of ancient organisms.\nThe evolutionary origins of a behavior also may be uncovered by studying behavioral homologies.\nTinbergen advocated comparing behaviors in one species with corresponding behaviors in another\nspecies, and then determining whether the similarities reflect a common genetic background or\nconvergent evolution. Lorenz provided careful descriptions of behavior in birds and showed how such\ndescriptions could be used to develop classification systems (Lorenz, 1971). Other approaches to\nuncovering the evolutionary origins of a behavior involve studying behavior genetics, relations between\nmutations and behavior, and the formation of new species (speciation) and behavior.\nCurrent Status\nWhere have these historical antecedents led the study of comparative psychology and animal learning?\nIf we were to ask particular investigators, the answers we would get would be colored by their individual\nperspectives and biases. A more even-handed description might emerge from a content analysis of what\nis being published in comparative psychology and animal learning. We elected that approach and\nexamined the articles that appeared from 1990 to 2000 in a prominent journal that contains primarily\nresearch on comparative psychology (the Journal of Comparative Psychology or JCP) and a journal that\ncontains primarily research on animal learning (the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior\nProcesses or JEP:ABP). Both of these journals are published by the American Psychological Association\nand have a long and distinguished history that goes back more than a hundred years. Although they are\nnot the only journals in which research relevant to comparative psychology and animal learning may be\nfound, JCP and JEP:ABP publish primarily the work of psychologists (rather than zoologists or biologists)\nand therefore provide a good window on the activities of psychologists in these fields. 318\nPerusing current research in comparative psychology and animal learning, one is immediately struck by\nthe wide range of issues that are addressed. There are virtually no limits to what aspect of behavior a\nparticular scientist may choose to study. As a starting point for our content analysis, we were guided by\nTinbergen's questions of ontogeny, immediate causation, adaptive function, and evolutionary history.\nHowever, we deviated a bit from his definition of these categories to be more consistent with current\nusage. In contemporary thinking, studies of learning are considered to involve questions of immediate\ncausation rather than ontogeny. We followed this convention and categorized studies of learning as\nrelevant to immediate causation unless an explicit developmental issue was being addressed.\nTable 1 summarizes the proportion of the papers published in JCP and JEP:ABP that were devoted to\nquestions of ontogeny, immediate causation, adaptive function, and evolutionary history. Modern\nstudies of comparative psychology focused primarily on behavioral ontogeny and immediate causation.\nOnly 4% of the papers in JCP addressed the adaptive function question, or how a particular behavior\ncontributes to survival and reproductive fitness. Nearly three times as many papers (11%) address the\nquestion of evolutionary history. In contrast, studies of animal learning, as exemplified by the research\npublished in JEP:ABP, dealt primarily with questions of immediate causation. Ontogenetic investigations\nand studies with a focus on adaptive function or evolutionary history hardly ever appeared. Overall,\ncomparative psychologists examined a wider range of activities than students of animal learning and\nwere more concerned with the ontogenetic and phylogenetic context of behavior. In contrast, students\nof animal learning concentrated on how a behavior is controlled by recently experienced events.\nSpecific Issues and Examples\nOntogeny. In JCP, most of the studies of behavioral ontogeny focused on either cognition (30%) or social\nbehavior (51%). Interestingly, 70% of the studies of cognitive development involved primates (apes,\nhumans, or monkeys). Investigators reported on issues of cognitive development raised by Piaget, such\nas ontogeny of sensorimotor intelligence, object permanence, and conservation. Research on the\nontogeny of social behavior addressed issues of agonistic behavior in mice, maternity (maternal\nattachment, parental care by the mother, and maternal aggression) and communication within a social\ncontext (song development in birds, affiliative vocalizations in birds and monkeys, grunt communication\nin humans, and whistle contour development in dolphins).\nOne of the studies of ontogeny published in JCP characterized the development of tool use in infant\nchimpanzees (Inoue-Nakamura & Matsuzawa, 1997). These investigators observed chimpanzees in the\nfield at Bossou, Guinea, from 1992 to 1995. On 692 occasions they saw an infant manipulate a nut with a\nstone. They also recorded 150 episodes of an infant observing an adult manipulate a nut with a stone.\nThe results showed that the wild chimpanzees began to use hammer and anvil stones to crack open oil-\npalm nuts at three and a half years of age. The infant chimps demonstrated mastery of all the basic\nactions necessary for nut cracking by two and a half years of age, but they did not combine the\nresponses in an appropriate sequence until they were a year older.\nIn another study of behavioral ontogeny, Hanson and Coss (1997) examined age differences in the\nresponse of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) to predators. California ground squirrels\nencounter a variety of predators including snakes, mammals (badgers, dogs, coyotes), and birds (hawks\nand eagles). The degree of danger presented by these predators differs depending on age. For example,\nadult ground squirrels are in less danger from snakes than infants due to their ability to physically\nretaliate and their strong resistance to rattlesnake venom. 319\nHanson and Coss (1997) asked whether the antipredator responses to bird and mammal predators\nwould differ according to age. Juvenile and adult ground squirrels were videotaped responding to a brief\npresentation of a live dog or a model of a red-tailed hawk in simulated flight. The juveniles did not\ndifferentiate between the bird and mammal predators and responded to both as dangerous. In contrast,\nthe adults treated the hawk as of more immediate danger than the dog. In a second experiment,\njuveniles and adults were presented models of red-tailed hawks, nonthreatening turkey vultures, and\ncrows. At neither age did the ground squirrels discriminate among the bird predators, though adults\ntreated the aerial predators as more dangerous than the juveniles. The authors concluded that learning\nmight play a role in the anti-predatory behavior of California ground squirrels.\nImmediate Causation. The second question proposed by Tinbergen concerned immediate causation.\nMore of the articles we looked at dealt with immediate causation than with any of the other four\ncategories of research questions. However, the emphasis on studies of immediate causation was greater\nin JEP:ABP than in JCP.\nImmediate causal mechanisms can be examined for any behavior. Indeed, the studies of immediate\ncausation covered a remarkably large range of behavioral phenomena.\nA list of the topics and the number of papers relevant to each topic that we encountered in studies of\nimmediate causation in JCP and JEP:ABP are presented in Table 2. Both comparative and learning\npsychologists studied perception/attention, memory mechanisms, basic learning processes, and\ncomplex cognition. However, there were differences in emphasis. As might be expected, learning and\nmemory phenomena were addressed in much greater detail in JEP:ABP than in JCP. In addition, studies\nin JEP:ABP dealt with forms of learning (such as drug conditioning and conditioned changes in pain\nsensitivity) that were not examined by comparative psychologists. In contrast, comparative\npsychologists examined a much wider range of behaviors. These included various aspects of\nreproductive behavior, social behavior, foraging, as well as defensive behavior and aggression.\nAnother interesting point of contrast between comparative psychologists and investigators of animal\nlearning is that comparative psychologists were more likely to tackle forms of cognition that have been\nprimarily associated with human beings. These included topics such as perspective taking, theory of\nknowledge, and imitation. An important task in studies of these and other forms of animal cognition is\nto isolate the factors that control the animal's behavior. Only if the immediate causes of the behavior\nare clearly identified can one decide whether the observed behavior reflects complex cognitive\nprocesses or simpler associative and perceptual mechanisms. Studies of imitation clearly illustrate this\nproblem.\nIn 1949, Fisher and Hinde reported on birds (blue tits) that had been robbing cream from milk bottles\ndelivered to the doors of English homes. Observers speculated that a single blue tit had discovered,\nprobably quite by accident, how to peck through a bottle cap and consume the rich cream that floated\non top of the milk. The occurrence of milk theft then gradually spread throughout the whole of England\nand into Europe through some form of social learning.\nFisher and Hinde argued that animals can acquire information through social interaction and that\nacquisition of such information may prove to be adaptive. The question is what exactly is being\ntransmitted? Is information about stimuli being transmitted or are the animals learning about\nresponses? Did the first bird to open a milk bottle transmit information about the stimulus (milk bottles\nare predictive of food) or about the response required to open the bottle (when you encounter these\ntypes of objects, open the bottle in the following manner)? 320\nSocial learning that occurs because of increased attention to particular stimuli is called 'local\nenhancement.' Local enhancement was defined by Thorpe (1956) as 'an apparent imitation that resulted\nin one animal directing another animal's attention to a particular object or to a particular part of the\nenvironment' (p. 134). The cream theft behavior exhibited by blue tits may have been an instance of\nlocal enhancement in that the behavior of one blue tit served to direct the attention of a naive bird to\nthe milk bottle. Once drawn to the milk bottle, the naive bird may have learned to open it without\npaying attention to how another bird did that.\nLocal enhancement is difficult to rule out in studies of imitative learning because the imitated response\nusually occurs in the context of distinctive cues that may attract more attention when the demonstrator\nperforms its prescribed response. A particularly effective procedure for controlling local enhancement\neffects is called the 'two-action method'. In the two-action method, different demonstrators respond to\na stimulus in distinctive ways. In a recent study, for example, Akins and Zentall (1996) trained\ndomesticated quail to manipulate a small platform (3.8 cm square) by either pecking it or stepping on it.\nOnce the demonstrators learned to either peck or step on the treadle, one group of observers was\nallowed to watch a demonstrator peck the treadle, and a second group was allowed to watch a\ndemonstrator step on the treadle. The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether observers\nacquired the specific response they saw their demonstrator perform.\nThe two-action method assumes that local enhancement will occur with either demonstrated response.\nIn the Akins and Zentall study, pecking the treadle and stepping on it should have drawn attention to the\ntreadle equally. Thus, if seeing the demonstrators manipulate the treadle produced local enhancement,\nit should not have mattered whether the demonstrators pecked or stepped on the treadle. Contrary to\nthat prediction, however, the response of the observers matched the response form they had seen their\ndemonstrator perform. Quail that observed demonstrators peck the treadle were more likely to peck\nthan to step on the treadle, and quail that observed demonstrators stepping on the treadle were more\nlikely to do that than to peck. This shows that imitative learning can occur independent of local\nenhancement.\nAdaptive Function. Psychologists rarely examined the question of adaptive function - how a particular\nbehavior increased an animal's chances of survival and reproductive fitness. Only 20 papers in JCP\nfocused on this issue and none examined adaptive significance in JEP:ABP. In JCP, the majority of the\npapers on adaptive function examined reproductive fitness. Investigations addressed paternity\nadvantages accrued from conditioned stimuli, preference for phenotypical variation in mates, acoustic\nbehaviors related to increased survivability and mating success, the strange-male effect, and unusual\npatterns of copulatory behavior. Other papers examined investigation behavior in snakes, predatory and\nanti-predatory behavior in snakes and mice, and cues used to increase foraging efficiency in monkeys\nwho forage at night.\nIn one of the most dramatic studies of reproductive behavior, Karen Hollis and her undergraduate\nstudents at Mount Holyoke College asked whether stimuli that reliably predict events of biological\nsignificance (classically conditioned stimuli) lead to greater survival or reproductive success (Hollis,\nPharr, Dumas, Britton, & Field, 1997). They worked with blue gouramis (Trichogaster trichopterus), a\nfreshwater fish that lives in the tropics. Male blue gourami are territorial and aggressively defend their\nnest sites. Often this aggressiveness interferes with their ability to attract females and mate because\nmales chase off females as well as males. To determine whether classically conditioned stimuli could\nhave adaptive value in this situation, Hollis presented male blue gourami with a signal followed by\npresentation of a receptive female fish. Subjects in a second group also received presentations of the\nstimulus and a receptive female, but these were unpaired. 321\nFollowing a short training phase, the males were given an opportunity to mate. For one group, the\narrival of a female was signaled by presentation of the classically conditioned stimulus. For the other\ngroup, the arrival of the female was not signaled. Signaling the arrival of the female had multiple effects.\nFirst, males that received the Pavlovian signal showed less aggression towards the females compared to\nthe males in the control group. Second, the classically conditioned males spawned with the females\nsooner, clasped the females more often, and most importantly, produced far more young than did\nmales in the control group. This experiment provided the first direct demonstration that classically\nconditioned stimuli can significantly contribute to reproductive success and supported Hollis's\ncontention that classical conditioned stimuli have adaptive value.\nEvolutionary History. Perhaps the most difficult of Tinbergen's questions to get evidence for concerns\nthe evolutionary history of a behavior. The evolution of behavior is rarely addressed by any single\nresearch report. Rather evolutionary issues are discussed in papers that attempt to integrate the results\nof studies with various species. As Table 1 indicates, such papers appeared primarily in JCP. Of the 53\npapers in JCP concerned with ultimate causation, 32 dealt with laterality or handedness and were\nconducted with primates. Other papers concerned the heritability of behavior, the evolutionary history\nof tool use, evolution of foraging and defense behavior, and evolution of communication signals.\nWhat is the point of studying laterality in primates? Comparative psychologists study handedness in an\neffort to obtain information about the evolution and development of complex cognition. Annett (1985)\nreported that approximately 90% of the human population is right-handed. Because movements of the\nright hand are controlled by the left side of the brain, right-handedness reflects a left hemisphere\nspecialization for manual control. Language is also controlled by the left side of the brain. These\nobservations have been used to argue that left-hemispheric specialization for manual control played an\nimportant role in the evolution of language and other cognitive functions (Calvin, 1994). The possible\nconnection between handedness and complex cognition has encouraged comparative psychologists to\nstudy the extent and the nature of handedness in animals and to use that information to answer\nquestions related to the evolution of intelligence.\nWestergaard and Suomi (1996) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nexamined hand preference in tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).\nPlastic tubes lined with food were presented to the monkeys. To get the food, the monkeys had to hold\nthe plastic tube with one hand and dig out the food with the other. The tests showed a population-level\nbias toward use of the right hand in rhesus monkeys but not in capuchin monkeys. In addition, the\ncapuchin monkeys showed greater hand preference on an individual basis than did the rhesus monkeys.\nFinally, for capuchins, but not for rhesus monkeys, the hand preference was greater for adults than for\nimmature animals.\nIn a recent follow up, Westergaard, Kuhn, and Suomi (1998) studied the influence of bipedal posture on\nhand preference in humans and rhesus monkeys. Humans and rhesus monkeys were observed reaching\nfor objects from either a quadrapedal or bipedal posture. Human participants demonstrated a right-\nhand population-level preference for the right hand regardless of whether they reached from a\nquadrapedal or bipedal posture. Rhesus macaques showed a left hand population-level preference\nwhen reaching from the quadrapedal posture, but a significant shift toward the right hand when\nreaching from the bipedal posture. When the authors examined preferences for 10 primate species,\nthey discovered that right hand preferences appear to be correlated with bipedal reaching. The authors\nconclude with the interesting idea that bipedalism 'may have facilitated species-typical right-\nhandedness in humans.' 322\nSpecies Diversity\nIn 1951 Tinbergen denounced comparative psychology as being too narrow in its focus on learning and\nin its use of a small number of laboratory species (see also Beach, 1950). He was not amused by the fact\nthat Tolman dedicated his famous 1932 book Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men to the albino rat.\nTinbergen commented that 'in spite of the high respect deserved by the interesting work done with rats,\none should be a little skeptical of the laboratory rat as a representative of the whole animal kingdom'\n(Tinbergen, 1951, p. 11.).\nTinbergen's criticism was justified at the time but does not apply to contemporary work in comparative\npsychology. Between 1990 and 2000, articles in JCP involved research with 132 different species. Each\nyear, an average of 33 different species served in comparative experiments. The most frequently used\nspecies were rats (Rattus norvegicus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodyte), humans (Homo sapiens), rhesus\nmacaques (Macaca mulata), capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), pigeons (Columba livia), and honeybees\n(Apis mellifera). Primates (humans, apes, and monkeys) were the subjects of investigation in 36% of the\npapers published in JCP. Studies with birds (23%) and rodents (22%) constituted the next most popular\nchoices. The diversity of species employed was remarkable. From earthworms(Lumbricus terristris) and\ncuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to bonobos chimpanzees (Pan paniscus), comparative psychologists are using\nmany different kinds of animals.\nThe diversity of species that we found in JCP did not carry over to JEP:ABP. In JEP:ABP, primates\n(including humans) were the subject of 11% of the research reports. In contrast, rats and pigeons\naccounted for 78% of the papers. However, since 1990 JEP:ABP has also included studies with zebra\nfinches, dolphins, Clark's nutcrackers, chickadees, ferrets, gerbils, honey bees, humming birds, junkos,\nscrub jays, starlings, and quail.\nThe Future of Comparative Psychology and Animal Learning\nComing Back Together\nAlthough comparative psychology and animal learning had common origins in the writings of Darwin\nand Romanes, the two areas subsequently developed in different directions. Animal learning came to\nfocus on the mechanisms of behavior and invested much of its energy in detailed exploration of a\nlimited number of species and a small number of experimental preparations. In contrast, comparative\npsychology was moved by the influence of ethologists to consider a broad range of behaviors and\nspecies, using a variety of experimental techniques. However, investigators of both comparative\npsychology and animal learning have preferred the laboratory to the field. Between 1990 and 2000, only\nnine papers in JCP and none in JEP:ABP focused on field observations. Interestingly, of the nine papers,\nseven were from 1998 and four of these papers were published in 2000. Perhaps we are seeing the\nbeginning of a trend toward greater use of field observation in comparative psychology.\nWe predict that the future will see comparative psychology and animal learning come back together\nagain. Investigators of animal learning will increasingly turn their attention to the wide range of\nbehaviors that comparative psychologists have been studying. This will lead to more studies of how\nlearning is involved in various forms of social behavior, such as sexual behavior, maternal and paternal\ncare, kin selection, dominance hierarchies, territorial behavior, and predator/prey interactions.\nBoth comparative psychology and animal learning will continue to be concerned with issues of\nbehavioral evolution. In particular, studies of behavioral evolution should get a special boost from\ntechnological advances in biology such as gene splicing and DNA fingerprinting. In addition, we hope 323\nthat studies of animal learning will include a broader range of species, and species specifically selected\nto highlight adaptive specializations and evolutionary influences on learning.\nIt will continue to be important for investigators in comparative psychology and animal learning to be\nsensitive to how their laboratory paradigms are related to the ecology of their species. As Tinbergen\n(1951, 1963) pointed out, it is important to know the behavioral patterns of the species being studied.\nNaturalistic observation can inform investigators of what aspects of behavior can profitably be\ninvestigated to address questions related to learning and cognition. Naturalistic observation is also a rich\nsource of hypotheses for later laboratory investigations.\nOne of the dramatic findings from our content analysis was the relatively little effort being devoted to\nstudies of how certain behaviors or behavioral mechanisms promote survival and reproductive fitness\n(see Table 1). We hope that studies of the adaptive functions of behavior will attract more of the\nattention of both comparative psychologists and students of animal learning in the coming years.\nTinbergen's four questions were proposed nearly half a century ago and all of them have become well\naccepted as necessary for a comprehensive account of the causes of a behavior. It may be time to put\nthese sentiments more fully into practice by devoting more effort to studying the functional significance\nof the behaviors that attract our attention.\nSome of the trends we are predicting are already underway. Contemporary interest in mechanisms of\nmemory and other forms of animal cognition are evident in recent issues of JEP:ABP. This represents a\nshift away from associationistic problems to broader issues of comparative cognition. Some\ninvestigators of learning are also starting to move away from the simple lights and tones that were\ncommonly used in traditional studies of learning to more complex, and presumably more ecologically\nvalid, stimuli (Cook, Cavoto, Katz, & Cavoto, 1997; Fetterman, 1996; Spetch, 1995).\nAnother trend that will be evident in comparative psychology and animal learning is greater interest in\nthe physiological mechanisms of behavior. This in turn will lead to more interdisciplinary research.\nTraditional boundaries between different fields of science (chemistry, biology, physics) are eroding, and\nthis is accompanied by greater interest in investigating phenomena at multiple levels of analysis.\nPsychological phenomena like cognition and learning can be described at the level of behavior, or at the\nlevel of neural structures and networks, neurotransmitter systems, or cellular mechanisms. In the past,\nindividual investigators worked primarily at one or another level of analysis. It is now time to put all the\nparts and levels back together. We need to know how events occurring at the cellular level influence the\noperation of neural systems and how neural networks determine observable behavioral actions.\nIncreasingly investigators will be working in interdisciplinary teams to create an integrated model of\nanimal learning and behavior.\nTwo Nagging Unresolved (Unresolvable?) Problems\nThe evolution of cognition and learning has been difficult to study because as one traces back an\nevolutionary lineage, at some point one has to demonstrate the absence of a phenomenon or skill.\nHowever, the failure to find a particular cognitive skill may say more about the ineptitude of the\nexperimenter than the ineptitude of the animal being studied. As experimenters have become more\nskillful in examining the behavioral potentials of animals, the documented skills of the animals havealso\nincreased. For example, early comparisons of pigeons and monkeys suggested that pigeons cannot learn\na generalized same-different concept but monkeys can. However, with subsequent improvements in\nbehavioral technology, pigeons have been shown to be perfectly capable of the task (e.g., Wright, Cook, 324\nRivera, Sands, & Delius, 1988). Thus, as the experimenters have become smarter in examining the\ncognitive capacities of pigeons, they have found pigeons to seem smarter as well.\nInterpretation of the evolutionary lineage of a particular cognitive or learning capacity also has been\nhampered, ironically, by increases in theoretical sophistication. In some cases, seemingly 'intelligent'\nbehavior has turned out to be mediated by fairly elementary associative mechanisms. Recent analyses\nof the phenomenon of transitive interference illustrate this type of development.\nTransitive inference involves forming a mental representation of a sequence of stimuli based on training\nwith only two of the stimuli at a time. Consider for example, five stimuli, which we could label A, B, C, D,\nand E. During training trials, subjects are exposed to one pair of stimuli at a time. The training pairs are\nA-B, B-C, C-D, and D-E. Which stimulus is presented on the right or the left in the stimulus display is\nvaried randomly across trials. With each stimulus pair, the subject is reinforced (with food, for example)\nfor selecting the stimulus that is closer to the beginning of the alphabet. Thus, in a choice between A\nand B, the subject is reinforced for choosing A, but in a choice of B and C, the subject is reinforced for\nchoosing B.\nWith this kind of training, stimuli (B, C, and D) appear equally often as reinforced and non reinforced\nstimuli. The main point of the experiment is to determine how the subjects will respond during a test\ntrial when they encounter a novel pair of stimuli, B vs. D for example. Based on how often stimuli B and\nD were reinforced during training, there should be no basis for selecting between them. However, if the\nsubject learned that the stimuli form a linear sequence A \u00ae E, it should select B over D. Such a choice is\nconsidered to be evidence of 'transitive inference' and is presumably based on the subject having\nextracted the entire stimulus sequence A\u00ae E from its experience with the stimulus pairs during training.\nTransitive inference was first documented in chimpanzees and people and was interpreted as\ndemonstrating a complex cognitive skill. More recently, however, transitive inference has been\ndemonstrated in pigeons as well, and this work showed that such seemingly complex cognitive\nperformance can in fact be explained by the fairly elementary associative mechanism of value transfer\n(Couvillon & Bitterman, 1992; von Fersen, Wynne, Delius, & Staddon, 1991; Zentall & Sherburne, 1994).\nAccording to value transfer, a non reinforced stimulus gains some 'value' or associative strength by\nstimulus generalization if it occurs in combination with another cue that is reinforced. This mechanism\npredicts that subjects will select B over D following training with adjacent stimulus pairs in a transitive\ninference procedure because the training pairs permit more transfer or generalization of associative\nvalue to stimulus B than to stimulus D.\nThe history of research on transitive inference illustrates how pigeons have become more capable as\nexperimenters have become more sophisticated in the design of their experiments. This history also\nillustrates that a phenomenon that appears to reflect the operation of a fairly complex cognitive process\n(transitive inference) may in fact be produced by simple associative mechanisms once those associative\nmechanisms are successfully identified. Clever Hans was an early example of cleverness that upon\nfurther analysis turned out to be not so clever (see Pfungst, 1965). The future will no doubt continue to\nchallenge us with examples of complex cognition that turn out to be not so complex.\nKeeping the Torch Burning\nComparative psychology and animal learning originated as areas of pure research. Some of the findings\nhave formed the basis for applications to education and behavior therapy, but comparative psychology\nand animal learning continue primarily as scholarly and intellectual endeavors. Students seeking a career\nin these areas are pretty much restricted to positions at colleges, universities, and research institutes. 325\nUnfortunately, not many positions explicitly calling for someone in comparative psychology or animal\nlearning become available each year. Students are more likely to succeed in obtaining employment if\nthey also have strong skills in experimental design, statistics, and various laboratory procedures so that\nthey can fulfill the requirements for positions in general experimental psychology.\nExperimentation in comparative psychology and animal learning is expensive and most of it is funded by\ngovernment agencies. Because of this, future investigators are well advised to hone their writing skills,\nlearn as much as they can about potential sources of funding, and gain experience in writing grant\napplications.\nWhether young or old, all investigators have to justify their work to be successful. One approach to\njustifying comparative psychology and animal learning is to argue that knowledge in these areas is\nessential for other important lines of inquiry. For example, one cannot begin to examine the\nphysiological basis of a behavior without first studying the behavior itself. This requires determining how\nto measure various aspects of the behavior and figuring out how these behavioral parameters are\ngoverned by procedural and stimulus variables. Comparative psychology and animal learning provide\nthe behavioral technology that is the foundation for physiological investigations of brain-behavior\nrelationships. Behavioral work with animals is also essential for the development and testing of\npsychopharmacological agents, for understanding how commonly abused drugs affect behavior, and for\nresearch on the psychological effects of toxins in the environment and in food.\nResearch in comparative psychology and animal learning is also easy to justify for its own sake. Insight\ninto comparative psychology does not lead to wealth, but it leads to wisdom. The comparative method\nis essential for our understanding of just about everything. One cannot appreciate the size of the Earth\nwithout comparing it to other planets. One cannot appreciate the warmth of a sunny day except in\ncomparison to the cold of a winter day. And, most importantly in the present context, one cannot\ncomprehend what it is to be human without understanding nonhuman animal life. Just as astronomy is\nessential for us to appreciate how special planet earth is in the greater scheme of celestial objects, solar\nsystems, and galaxies, so too comparative psychology is essential for us to understand the place of\nhumanity in the broader context of animal life and living things in general. As long as we want to know\nabout ourselves, we will have to continue learning about other animals as well.\nReferences\nAkins, C. K., & Zentall, T. R. (1996).

S. in general - experimental\npsychology in 1976 and my PhD in 1978 from Colorado State University. I\ngraduated with an emphasis in comparative psychology and my areas of\nspecialization included animal learning and animal behavior. I am currently\nBrown Distinguished Research Pofessor and chair of the Department of\nPsychology at Southwestern University where I have been since 1978.\nI direct an active research program that involves undergraduate students\nexclusively. With the help of these students I have authored and co-authored\nover 30 articles and made over 40 professional presentations. In November 2000 Wadsworth published\na textbook in learning and memory that I wrote with Markham, Schwartz, and Gordon. My research is\nprimarily carried out at Southwestern University's Aquatic Animal Research Laboratory a facility that\nhouses both fresh water and salt water organisms. Since arriving at Southwestern University I have\nspent summers conducting research at the University of Hawaii (Bekesy Laboratory for Neurobiology),\nNational Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle, Washington, University of Texas Marine Science Institute in\nPort Aransas, TX, the National Resource Center for Cephalopods in Galveston, TX and the Bamfield\nMarine Station on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.\nMy research program focuses on basic animal learning processes in aquatic animals where I continue to\nexplore the mechanisms and the adaptive role of learning involved in aquatic animals. I am also\ninterested in questions relating to optimal foraging in aquatic animals, defensive behaviors in aquatic 333\nanimals, and predator-prey interactions. The research with cuttlefish has been highlighted on the\nDiscovery Channel's World of Wonder. Currently I am involved in a project examining anti-predator\nresponses by salmon to sights and sounds of killer whales. To obtain the sounds of killer whales my\nstudents and I traveled to Telegraph Cove, Vancouver Island, British Columbia where from a 15-foot\ninflatable raft we observed and recorded sounds from the northern resident pod of Orcinus orca.\nI am active in several professional organizations including the Southwestern Comparative Psychology\nAssociation, the Southwestern Psychological Association, and Psi Chi. I served on the board of directors\nfor SCPA and I served as President-elect, President, and Past President of SWPA. I am also active in Psi\nChi, the National Honor Society in Psychology. Nationally, I served as the Southwestern Regional Vice\nPresident from 1994 - 1997 and I was critically involved in developing Psi Chi's undergraduate small\nresearch grants program. I was elected National President-elect of Psi Chi in 1999 and I currently serve\nas National President.\nThe author may be reached at purdy@southwestern.edu\nJesse E.

My formal encounter with psychology\nbegan with a summer science program for high school students sponsored by the\nNational Science Foundation (NSF). This sparked my interest sufficiently to take\nadditional psychology courses while still in high school and then major in\npsychology as an undergraduate at Grinnell College. I enjoyed the experimental\nrigor and conceptual clarity of conditioning approaches to the analysis of behavior.\nI also enjoyed the satisfactions of tinkering in the laboratory. This combination,\ntogether with the camaraderie and friendships that develop among people working in a laboratory, has\nkept me in the profession ever since.\nI obtained my Ph.D. under the supervision of Shepard Siegel at McMaster University, and in 1973 I was\nhired as an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin with an annual salary of $11,500. I\nhave been at Texas ever since, but thankfully neither my title nor my salary have remained the same.\nCurrently, I am Professor and Chairman of the Department of Psychology.\nWhile in graduate school, I became interested in taste aversion learning and the generality of the laws of\nlearning. Since 1985, I have been exploring questions about the generality of the laws of learning\nthrough studies of sexual conditioning. My research on sexual conditioning has been generously\nsupported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and has\nearned me a Golden Fleece Award from Senator Proxmire, a MERIT Award from NIH, and the G. Stanley\nHall Lectureship from the American Psychological Association. Along the way, I managed to write the 334\nPrinciples of Learning and Behavior, which is now in its fourth edition, and the Essentials of Conditioning\nand Learning, which is now in its second edition. I also managed to serve as Editor of the Journal of\nExperimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes from 1985 to 1991, and as President of the\nDivision of Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology of the American Psychological\nAssociation in 2000. My work has been a major source of satisfaction. Through it all, I have also been\nsustained by my three wonderful children and by my graduate students who have contributed as much\nto my life as I have tried to contribute to theirs.\nThe author may be reached at domjan@psy.utexas.edu 335\nAbout the Editors\nJane S. Halonen began her academic career in 1981 at Alverno College, a\nsmall private college for women in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, renowned for its\nperformance-based curriculum and educational innovations.
