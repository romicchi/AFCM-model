Most introductory analysis courses focus initially on the Riemann in-\ntegral, with other definitions discussed later (if at all). The paradigm being proposed\nis that the Riemann integral and the \u201cgeneralized Riemann integral\u201d should be con-\nsidered simultaneously, not separately \u2013 in the same manner as uniform continuity\nand continuity. (Indeed, if it were not for historical and practical impediments, the\nterm uniform integrability would be preferable to Riemann integrability.) One defi-\nnition is not superior to the other. Riemann integrability is simply a special case of\nintegrability, with particular properties that are worth noting.\nThis point of view has implications for the treatment of other topics. Because the\ndefinition of the integral is stated in terms of gauges, it makes sense to translate this\nperspective to continuity and differentiability as well. Besides creating a smoother\ntransition between chapters, this approach mitigates some longstanding pedagogical\ndifficulties. For example, the manner in which uniform continuity is typically ex-\nplained can be unnecessarily confusing. For someone unfamiliar with the relevant\nproperties, the statements \u201cfor every x, for every \u03b5, there exists a \u03b4 such that ...\u201d and\n\u201cfor every \u03b5, there exists a \u03b4 such that ... for every x\u201d may be difficult to distinguish.\nEven though the difference is semantic, it seems more natural to ask whether a gauge 2\n(a function that assumes only positive values) can be taken to be constant. The\ntext also emphasizes the concept of uniform differentiability, which rarely receives\nmuch attention. This property has important implications to the continuity of the\nderivative, which is one of the major themes of Chapter 3.\nBecause of the initial emphasis on continuity, differentiability, and integrability,\nmostofthematerialrelatingtosequencesandserieshasbeendeferreduntilChapter5.\nThetreatmentofsequencesinChapter1focusesonafewessentialtopics, particularly\nthe Cauchy Criterion. The proof of the Cauchy Criterion is somewhat different from\nwhat appears in most textbooks, in that it does not rely on subsequences and the\nBolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem. Removing this \u201cefficiency\u201d allows for an argument\nthat deals more directly with the core concepts.\nAlthough it is largely independent of the issues discussed above, it is worth noting\nthat Chapter 3 includes several concrete examples of functions with discontinuous\nderivative. Inmanybooks,h(t) = t2sin(1/t)istheonlysuchfunctionthatisexplicitly\nmentioned. Despite its historical significance, this example may be perceived as a\ndeus ex machina, particularly if the trigonometric functions have not been formally\nintroduced. To understand the consequences of Darboux\u2019s Theorem, it is important\nto develop a solid intuition about the behavior of the functions to which it pertains.\nChapter 5 consists primarily of standard results relating to sequences and series,\nwith two substantial additions. First of all, Raabe\u2019s Test is discussed in more detail\nthan in other texts, with an emphasis on its connection to p-series. Secondly, Section\n5.5 is devoted entirely to the subject of Cesa`ro convergence. To the best of my\nknowledge, this is the first textbook to include a proof of Schep\u2019s Inequality (Theorem\n5.36). 3\nRemarks to new mathematicians\nEverymathematicianmustmakethetransitionatsomepointfromcomputationally-\noriented mathematics (e.g., calculus, differential equations, linear algebra) to proof-\nbased mathematics (e.g., real analysis, abstract algebra, topology). I often describe\nthis process as the evolution from a student of mathematics to a mathematician. The\ndistinction is that a student\u2019s main objective is to \u201cfind an answer,\u201d while the primary\nresponsibility of a mathematician is to understand and construct proofs.\nThis transition can take place in the context of any branch of mathematics, al-\nthough it is particularly common for real analysis to serve as the point of entry. In\naddition to its intrinsic importance, real analysis directly relates to material most stu-\ndents have encountered before (continuity, derivatives, integrals, and series). While\nmastery of calculus is no guarantee of success in analysis, familiarity with the basic\nconcepts is certainly helpful.\nMathematics is not a spectator sport. The exercises at the end of each chapter\nprovideanopportunitytoengageactivelywiththematerial. Ifpossible, takethetime\nto complete them all. Exercises marked with an asterisk are particularly important\nto the overall exposition and should not be skipped.\nWhen completing the exercises, the objective is not simply to \u201cfind a proof that\nworks.\u201d Mathematics that has not been clearly communicated has not been fully un-\nderstood. A large part of becoming a mathematician consists of learning to write\nmathematics clearly and effectively. I would recommend keeping the following guide-\nlines in mind:\n(1) Write in complete sentences. Use proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, and\nsyntax. Do not use needless abbreviations (such as \u201cb/c\u201d or \u201cw/o\u201d). 4\n(2) Employ mathematical notation wisely. Avoid symbols when words would work\nequally well. Incorporate your notation into your sentence structure. Treat\nlengthy equations as you would a lengthy quotation.\n(a) Apieceofsymbolicnotationshouldalwaysrepresenteitheraspecificobject\nor a complete phrase, and should not be used simply as an abbreviation.\nFor example, never write \u201cWhenever x \u2264 all of the elements in our set, ...\u201d\n(b) Never begin a sentence with a piece of symbolic notation. Never juxtapose\ntwo distinct pieces of notation without putting some verbiage between\nthem. For example, never write \u201cIf x \u2208 X, x \u2265 1.\u201d\n(3) Always make sure it is completely clear what you are trying to do. If you are\nattempting to prove a particular proposition, state the claim explicitly. If you\nare trying to give a counterexample to a certain hypothesis, explain exactly\nwhat it is you would like to show.\n(4) Edit your mathematical writing for style, correctness, and content.\n(5) Have a specific audience in mind when you are writing. Envision your reader\nas a mathematician at the appropriate level, but one who has not worked the\nexercises you are presenting. Think about what details you would need to see\nin order to understand a particular argument.\nI have done my best to follow these principles while composing this text. For anyone\ninterested in a further discussion of mathematical writing, I particularly recommend\nan article by Paul Halmos [30].\nNewer mathematicians may be surprised by the number of exercises that ask the\nreader to construct a particular example. Some of these examples are fairly straight- 5\nforward, while others require more ingenuity. Never underestimate the importance\nof an example, even a seemingly trivial one. An example can be just as powerful as\na theorem, as it can demonstrate the falseness of an assertion. An example can also\nbe a precursor to a theorem, providing specific evidence that leads to a more general\nobservation.\nThere is a brief set of historical notes following every chapter. While this text\ndoes not purport to be an historical treatise, it is important to consider the context\nin which the theory was developed. Readers are encouraged to learn more about\nhistorical questions they find interesting, either by perusing the references listed in\nthe bibliography or by conducting their own research. 6\nChapter 0\nCommon Notions\nKa\u00a8 t(cid:228) (cid:237)lon to(cid:220) m\u0141rous me(cid:216)zon.\n\u2013 Euclid, Stoiqe(cid:216)a (c. 300 BC)\n0.1 Sets\nThe building block of modern mathematics is the set. While the concept can be\ndescribed in a more technical manner, we will think of a set as being a well-defined\ncollection of distinct objects. The elements, or items within a set, may be numbers,\nNote to the reader. The material in this chapter, while essential to the study of real analysis, is\nnot specific to this branch of mathematics. You may have encountered many of these concepts in\nanother context, particularly if you have already studied a subject such as abstract algebra. You\nshould feel free to read quickly through topics with which you are already familiar, coming back\nlater if you need to remind yourself about any details. 7\nletters, functions, abstract symbols, or any other sort of object. For example,\n{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19} and {\u2663,\u2666,\u2665,\u2660}\nare both sets. We frequently use braces to demarcate a set and commas to distinguish\nits elements; the symbols \u201c{\u201d and \u201c}\u201d and \u201c,\u201d should not themselves be interpreted\nas elements of the set. We often assign a name to a set, typically a capital letter.\nThe symbol \u2208 indicates that a particular object belongs to a set, whereas \u2208/ means\nthe opposite. For example, if\nA = {\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3,\u03b4,\u03b5},\nthen \u03b3 \u2208 A and \u03b6 \u2208/ A.\nSeveral sets are so important that they have especially reserved symbols:\nN Natural numbers\nZ Integers\nQ Rational numbers .\nR Real numbers\nC Complex numbers\nAt this point, we will assume that most readers are intuitively familiar with each of\nthese sets. Throughout the text, we will take N to be the set of positive integers.\n(Unlike some authors, we do not view 0 as a natural number.) Every rational number\nr may be written\nm\nr = ,\nn\nwhere m belongs to Z and n belongs to N. Chapter 1 will provide a more formal\ntreatment of the set R, but we will make use of the standard algebraic properties 8\nof the real numbers whenever necessary. We will not explicitly consider the set C,\nalthough much of our work will be relevant in that context as well.\nFor a natural number n, we write [n] to denote the set {1,2,...,n}. A set con-\nsisting of a single element is often called a singleton set. The empty set, denoted \u2205, is\ndefined to be the set consisting of no elements. The similarity between the symbols\n\u2205 and 0 can sometimes lead to confusion. Note that {0} represents the singleton set\nconsisting of the number 0, while \u2205 signifies a set without any elements. It might be\nclearer to write {} instead of \u2205, but that notation is not commonly employed.\nRather than listing all the elements of a set explicitly, we will often use what is\ncalled set-builder notation to describe the elements in terms of some rule or relation.\nFor example, {k \u2208 Z : k \u2265 1} indicates the set of all integers that are greater than\nor equal to 1 (which would be another way of denoting N). Similarly, for any natural\nnumber n, we could write [n] as {k \u2208 N : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n}. Despite its superficial\nappearance, it is possible for a set defined in this fashion to be empty; for example,\n{s \u2208 R : s2 < 0} contains no elements.\nOne of our major points of interest will be the relationship between sets. We say\nthat a set A is a subset of a set B if every element of A also belongs to B. A subset\nA of B is called a proper subset if there is an element of B that does not belong to A.\nFor example, N is a proper subset of Z, since every natural number is an integer and\nthere is at least one integer that is not a natural number. We often use the notation\nA \u2286 B to indicate that A is a subset of B, writing A \u2282 B when we know that A is\na proper subset of B. (Readers should be aware that older texts sometimes use the\nsymbol \u2282 to denote a subset, with (cid:40) or (cid:36) signifying a proper subset.)\nFor a pair of sets A and B, we say that A = B whenever both A \u2286 B and B \u2286 A; 9\nthat is, A and B contain exactly the same elements. This principle, often known as\nmutual inclusion, is not only the definition for two sets being equal, but the standard\nmethod of proof as well. (See, for example, the proof of Proposition 0.1.)\nFor a pair of sets A and B, we define the intersection A\u2229B to be the set consisting\nof all elements that belong both to A and to B. The union A\u222aB is the set consisting\nof all elements belonging either to A or to B (or possibly both). In every instance,\n(A\u2229B) \u2286 A \u2286 (A\u222aB)\nand\n(A\u2229B) \u2286 B \u2286 (A\u222aB).\nThe sets A and B are called disjoint if A\u2229B = \u2205.\nThe difference A \\ B is defined to be the set of all elements in A that do not\nbelong to B. In certain situations, there may be a concept of a universal set; that is,\nevery set being considered is a subset of a particular set U. In this context, we define\nthe complement Ac to be the difference U \\A. Note that A\\B = A\u2229Bc whenever\nA and B belong to the same universal set. Unless otherwise noted, we will take the\nuniversal set to be R, so that Ac = R\\A.\nAt this point, we will make a few observations relating to the complement of a\nset. Items (2) and (3) below are known as De Morgan\u2019s laws.\nProposition 0.1 Let A and B be sets belonging to the same universal set.\n(1) The set (Ac)c is equal to A.\n(2) The set (A\u2229B)c is equal to Ac \u222aBc.\n(3) The set (A\u222aB)c is equal to Ac \u2229Bc. 10\nProof. (1) Suppose x belongs to (Ac)c. Therefore x does not belong to Ac, which\nmeans that x does not belong to the set of elements that do not belong to A. Con-\nsequently x belongs to A, so (Ac)c \u2286 A. On the other hand, suppose that x belongs\nto A. In that case, x does not belong to the set of elements that do not belong to A,\nso x does not belong to Ac. Thus x belongs to (Ac)c, so we conclude that A \u2286 (Ac)c.\nBy mutual inclusion, the two sets must be equal.\n(2) Suppose x belongs to the set (A \u2229 B)c. In that case, x does not belong to\nA\u2229B, so x cannot belong both to A and to B. Hence x must either fail to belong\nto A, in which case x belongs to Ac, or x must fail to belong to B, in which case x\nbelongs to Bc. Therefore x belongs to Ac\u222aBc, so (A\u2229B)c \u2286 Ac\u222aBc. Suppose then\nthat x belongs to Ac \u222a Bc. In other words, x belongs either to Ac or to Bc, which\nmeans that either x does not belong to A or x does not belong to B. Hence x does\nnot belong both to A and to B, so x does not belongs to A \u2229 B. Consequently x\nbelongs to (A\u2229B)c, so Ac \u222aBc \u2286 (A\u2229B)c. Thus the two sets must be equal.\n(3) We could employ an argument similar to that used to prove (2), but it is more\nefficient to apply the results we have already established. Items (1) and (2) show that\n(Ac \u2229Bc)c = (Ac)c \u222a(Bc)c = A\u222aB.\nTherefore\n(A\u222aB)c = ((Ac \u2229Bc)c)c = Ac \u2229Bc,\nas we had hoped to demonstrate.\nIn many situations, we will need to consider the intersection or union of more\nthan a single pair of sets. Let \u039b be any nonempty set. Fix a universal set U and\nsuppose that, for each \u03bb in \u039b, there is a corresponding subset of U that is denoted 11\nA . In this context, we refer to \u039b as the index set for the collection {A : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b}.\n\u03bb \u03bb\n(cid:84)\nThe intersection A consists of all elements of U that belong to A for each \u03bb\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u03bb \u03bb\n(cid:83)\nin \u039b. The union A consists of all elements of U that belong to A for at least\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u03bb \u03bb\none \u03bb in \u039b. We say that {A : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} is pairwise disjoint if any two distinct sets in\n\u03bb\nthe collection are disjoint.\nExample 0.2 Take Z to be the universal set and, for any k in the index set N, define\nA = {\u2212k,k}. Consider the collection {A : k \u2208 N}. First of all, we claim that\nk k\n(cid:92)\nA = \u2205.\nk\nk\u2208N\nNote that the integer 0 belongs to none of the sets A . A positive integer n does\nk\nnot belong to A unless k = n. Likewise, a negative integer n does not belong to A\nk k\nunless k = \u2212n. Hence there are no integers that belong to A for every k in N.\nk\nOn the other hand, we claim that\n(cid:91)\nA = Z\\{0}.\nk\nk\u2208N\nSuppose that n belongs to Z\\{0}. If n is positive, n belongs to the set A ; if n is\nn\nnegative,nbelongstoA . Ineithercase,nbelongsto(cid:83) A ,soZ\\{0} \u2286 (cid:83) A .\n\u2212n k\u2208N k k\u2208N k\n(cid:83)\nSupposethenthatnbelongsto A . Inthatcase, nmustbelongtoA = {\u2212k,k}\nk\u2208N k k\nfor some k in N, which means that either n = k or n = \u2212k. Thus n must be either\npositive or negative, so n belongs to Z\\{0}. Consequently (cid:83) A \u2286 Z\\{0}, so the\nk\u2208N k\ntwo sets must be equal.\nWe will typically employ the following notation to indicate intersections with 12\nrespect to the index sets [n] and N:\nn\n(cid:92) (cid:92)\nA instead of A ,\nk k\nk=1 k\u2208[n]\n\u221e\n(cid:92) (cid:92)\nA instead of A .\nk k\nk=1 k\u2208N\nWe will use the analogous notation for unions.\nBeforeproceedingfurther, weneedtointroduceoneadditionaloperationinvolving\nsets. Consider two (possibly identical) sets A and B. The ordered pair (a,b), for a\nin A and b in B, is simply the list consisting of those two elements in a fixed order.\n(More formally, one can define (a,b) as the set {a,{a,b}}, but we will not require\nthat level of technicality.) Two ordered pairs (a ,b ) and (a ,b ) are identical if and\n1 1 2 2\nonly if a = a and b = b . The Cartesian product A\u00d7B is the set consisting of all\n1 2 1 2\nsuch ordered pairs:\nA\u00d7B = {(a,b) : a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B}.\nLikewise, theCartesianproductA\u00d7B\u00d7C consistsofallorderedtriples(a,b,c), where\na, b, and c belong to the sets A, B, and C respectively. In general, one can construct\nthe Cartesian product of any finite collection of sets. (If any of the individual sets is\nempty, we define the Cartesian product to be empty as well.)\n0.2 Natural Numbers and Mathematical Induction\nThis section will focus on a few distinctive properties of the set N. We begin with\nan observation that should already be familiar to most readers. Recall that an integer\ngreater than or equal to 2 is called prime if its only positive integer factors are 1 and\nitself. 13\nProposition 0.3 Any integer greater than or equal to 2 has a unique factorization\ninto a product of prime numbers. In other words, any such integer can be written\nuniquely as the product pk1pk2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pkn, where the numbers p ,p ,...,p are prime\n1 2 n 1 2 n\n(listed in increasing order) and each prime is raised to a natural number.\nWhile the proof of this result is not complicated, it is beyond the scope of our\npresent discussion. See Section 2 of [18] for more details. Although we will primarily\nemploy this property in Section 0.4, we will use it now to establish an important fact.\n\u221a\nProposition 0.4 If p is prime, p is an irrational number.\nProof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are natural numbers m and\nn such that\n\u221a m\np = .\nn\nConsequently\nn2p = m2. (0.1)\nBased on the prime factorization of m, we know that the prime factorization of\nm2 must contain only even powers of prime numbers. The same fact holds for the\nprime factorization of n2. On the other hand, equation (0.1) shows that the prime\nfactorization of either m2 or n2 must contain an odd power of p. Hence we have\nobtained a contradiction.\nTo be honest, what we have actually shown is that there is no rational number\nwhose square is p. To complete the proof, we still need to demonstrate that the\nequation t2 = p has a unique positive real solution. We will address this issue in\nlater chapters (see Exercise 1.14 and Corollary 2.20). For the time being, we will 14\nassume the existence of nth roots, for any natural number n, for all non-negative real\nnumbers.\nWe will now introduce another property of N, which many readers may not have\nencountered previously.\nProposition 0.5 (Well-Ordering Principle) Every nonempty subset A of N contains\na least element. In other words, there is an element m of A such that m \u2264 k for all\nk in A.\nWe will view this property as an axiomatic assumption, rather than a result that\nrequires a proof. (See also Exercise 1.10.) As we shall see, this principle has several\nindispensable consequences. First and foremost, it gives rise to a powerful tool for\nverifying results that are stated in terms of the natural numbers.\nProposition 0.6 (Principle of Mathematical Induction) Let P(k) denote a propo-\nsition stated in terms of a natural number k. Suppose that P(1) is true. If, for every\nnatural number k, we can show that P(k) being true implies that P(k +1) is true,\nthen P(k) is true for all k in N.\nThe main idea underlying this principle is that, if P(k) is not true for all k, then\nthe set\nA = {k \u2208 N : P(k) is false}\nis nonempty. Hence the Well-Ordering Principle dictates that A must have a least\nelement m. By assumption, we know that 1 does not belong to A, so m \u2265 2. Thus\nm\u22121 is a natural number which, based on the definition of m, cannot belong to A.\nTherefore P(m\u22121) is true, which implies that P(m) is also true. Hence m does not 15\nbelong to A, which is a contradiction. Therefore A must be empty, which means that\nP(k) must be true for every natural number k.\nAs this argument may seem somewhat abstract, we will provide several examples\nthat illustrate how mathematical induction tends to be applied in practice.\nExample 0.7 For any natural number k, we claim that the sum\n1+2+3+...+k (0.2)\nis equal to k(k + 1)/2. First of all, we need to check the proposition for k = 1. In\nthat case, the sum in (0.2) is equal to 1, as is the expression k(k+1)/2. Now suppose\nthe proposition holds for a natural number k. In other words,\nk(k +1)\n1+2+3+...+k = .\n2\nConsequently\nk(k +1)\n(1+2+3+...+k)+k +1 = +k +1\n2\nk2 +3k +2\n=\n2\n(k +1)(k +2)\n= ,\n2\nso the proposition also holds for the natural number k +1. Therefore the formula is\nvalid for every natural number k.\nExample 0.8 Let s and t be non-negative real numbers. We claim that (s+t)k \u2265\nsk+tk for any natural number k. First of all, note that this inequality holds trivially\nwhen k = 1. Now suppose the inequality holds for an arbitrary natural number k. 16\nObserve that\n(s+t)k+1 = (s+t)k(s+t)\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n\u2265 sk +tk (s+t)\n= sk+1 +skt+stk +tk+1\n\u2265 sk+1 +tk+1,\nso the inequality also holds for the natural number k + 1. Hence the inequality is\nvalid for every natural number k.\nLet u and v be a pair of non-negative real numbers, with u \u2265 v. Applying the\npreceding inequality to s = u\u2212v and t = v, we see that\n(cid:0) (u\u2212v)+v(cid:1)k\n\u2265 (u\u2212v)k +vk,\nand hence\nuk \u2212vk \u2265 (u\u2212v)k.\nThis version of the inequality will also be useful.\nExample 0.9 Consider any list (b ,b ,...,b ) consisting of k (not necessarily dis-\n1 2 k\ntinct) positive numbers. If\nb b \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7b = 1, (0.3)\n1 2 k\nwe claim that\nb +b +...+b \u2265 k.\n1 2 k\nOur assertion holds when k = 1, since the only way for the product in (0.3) to equal\n1 is for b to be 1. Now suppose the claim holds for an arbitrary natural number\n1\nk. Consider a list (b ,b ,...,b ) with b b \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7b = 1. The fact that this product\n1 2 k+1 1 2 k+1 17\nequals 1 makes it impossible for every term in the list to be greater than 1 or for\nevery term to be less than 1. Since the order of the terms is unimportant, we will\nassume that b \u2264 1 and b \u2265 1. Consequently (1\u2212b )(1\u2212b ) \u2264 0, and hence\n1 2 1 2\n1+b b \u2264 b +b .\n1 2 1 2\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nNote that the list (b b ),b ,...,b consists of k terms, with\n1 2 3 k+1\n(b b )b \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7b = 1.\n1 2 3 k+1\nTherefore\n(b +b )+b +...+b \u2265 (1+b b )+b +...+b\n1 2 3 k+1 1 2 3 k+1\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n= 1+ (b b )+b +...+b\n1 2 3 k+1\n\u2265 1+k,\nso our claim also holds for the natural number k+1. Therefore the assertion is valid\nfor a list of k positive numbers, for any natural number k.\nThis result has several important consequences. Let (a ,a ,...,a ) be any list of\n1 2 k\nk positive numbers and define b = a /(a a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a )1/k for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Observe that\nj j 1 2 k\na a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a a a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a\n1 2 k 1 2 k\nb b \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7b = = = 1.\n1 2 k ((a a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a )1/k)k a a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a\n1 2 k 1 2 k\nTherefore the result we just established shows that\na +a +...+a\n1 2 k\n= b +b +...+b \u2265 k,\n(a a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a )1/k 1 2 k\n1 2 k\nand hence\na +a +...+a\n1 2 k \u2265 (a a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a )1/k.

A function f: A \u2192 B is a rule that assigns\nto each element of A a particular element of B. In this context, A is referred to\nas the domain of the function and B as the codomain of the function. (There is a\nmore formal way of defining a function in terms of the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B,\nbut that discussion would be more appropriate in a different setting.) It is important\nto emphasize that the definition of a function has three components: the domain,\nthe codomain, and the rule. In lower-level courses, students are usually taught to\nview the rule as the defining feature of a function. Modifying either the domain or\ncodomain, however, gives rise to a different function. 19\nExample 0.10 Let [0,\u221e) denote the set {s \u2208 R : s \u2265 0}. Define f: N \u2192 N by the\nrule f(k) = k2. Define g: Z \u2192 Z by the rule g(k) = k2. Define h: [0,\u221e) \u2192 [0,\u221e)\nby the rule h(t) = t2. Define i: R \u2192 [0,\u221e) by the rule i(t) = t2. These functions are\nall distinct, even though they share the same rule. As we shall see momentarily, they\nbehave differently with regard to several fundamental properties.\nDefinition 0.11 A function f: A \u2192 B is injective if f(a ) = f(a ) implies that\n1 2\na = a . In other words, for every b in B, there is no more than one a in A such that\n1 2\nb = f(a).\nDefinition 0.12 A function f: A \u2192 B is surjective if, for every b in B, there is at\nleast one a in A such that b = f(a).\nDefinition 0.13 A function f: A \u2192 B is bijective if it is both injective and surjec-\ntive; that is, for every b in B, there is exactly one a in A such that b = f(a).\nThe terms injection, surjection, and bijection are used respectively to denote a\nfunction that is injective, surjective, and bijective. Many authors write one-to-one in\nplace of injective and onto in place of surjective. The term one-to-one correspondence\nis sometimes used to describe a bijection.\nInreferencetoExample0.10,thefunctionf: N \u2192 Nisinjectivebutnotsurjective;\ng: Z \u2192 Z is neither injective nor surjective; h: [0,\u221e) \u2192 [0,\u221e) is bijective; and\ni: R \u2192 [0,\u221e) is surjective but not injective. (See Exercise 0.16.) In other words,\ninjectivity and surjectivity depend on the domain and codomain of a function, just\nas much as they depend on the rule.\nConsider a function f: A \u2192 B. If A is a subset of the domain A, the image\n1 20\nf(A ) is defined to be the following subset of the codomain:\n1\nf(A ) = {b \u2208 B : b = f(a) for some a \u2208 A }.\n1 1\nIt should be apparent from this definition that f: A \u2192 B is surjective if and only if\nf(A) = B. For a subset B of the codomain B, the preimage f\u22121(B ) is defined to\n1 1\nbe the following subset of the domain:\nf\u22121(B ) = {a \u2208 A : f(a) \u2208 B }.\n1 1\nIt is possible for the preimage of a set to be empty. Taking f: N \u2192 N to be defined\nas in Example 0.10, we see that f\u22121({2,3}) = \u2205, since there is no natural number\nwhose square is either 2 or 3. On the other hand, considering i: R \u2192 [0,\u221e), we see\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\nthat i\u22121({2,3}) = {\u2212 3,\u2212 2, 2, 3}.\nFor a pair of functions f: A \u2192 B and g: B \u2192 C, the composition g \u25e6 f is the\nfunction with domain A and codomain C that is given by the rule\n(g \u25e6f)(a) = g(f(a)).\nIn other words, the function f takes an element a in A to the element f(a) in B; the\nfunction g then takes the element f(a) in B to the element g(f(a)) in C. Functional\ncomposition is associative, in that h\u25e6(g\u25e6f) = (h\u25e6g)\u25e6f for any function h: C \u2192 D.\nNot only does composition fail to be commutative, but f\u25e6g is not even defined unless\nA = C.\nFor a set A, the corresponding identity map is the function i : A \u2192 A given by\nA\nthe rule i (a) = a. A function f: A \u2192 B is said to be invertible if there is a function\nA\ng: B \u2192 A such that g \u25e6 f: A \u2192 A is the identity map on A and f \u25e6 g: B \u2192 B is\nthe identity map on B. In other words, the function g \u201cundoes\u201d the action of f and 21\nthe function f \u201cundoes\u201d the action of g. If f: A \u2192 B is invertible, the corresponding\nfunction g: B \u2192 A must be unique. If there were two such functions g and g , we\n1 2\nwould have\ng = g \u25e6i = g \u25e6(f \u25e6g ) = (g \u25e6f)\u25e6g = i \u25e6g = g .\n1 1 B 1 2 1 2 A 2 2\nIn this case, we refer to g as the inverse of f, often labeling it f\u22121. Note that\nf\u22121: B \u2192 A is also invertible, since f \u25e6f\u22121 = i and f\u22121 \u25e6f = i .\nB A\nAs it turns out, the property of invertibility can be restated in terms of another\nproperty we have already discussed.\nProposition 0.14 A function is invertible if and only if it is bijective.\nProof. Suppose f: A \u2192 B is bijective. In that case, for any b in B, there is a\nunique element a in A such that b = f(a). We will label this element of A as g(b),\nthus establishing a function g : B \u2192 A. Restating the definition of g, we see that\nb = f(g(b)) for all b in B, which means that f \u25e6 g: B \u2192 B is equal to i . Now\nB\nconsider the function g \u25e6f: A \u2192 A. For any a in A, observe that\nf(g(f(a))) = i (f(a)) = f(a).\nB\nSince f is injective, it follows that g(f(a)) = a. Consequently g \u25e6 f = i , so f is\nA\ninvertible.\nSuppose then that f: A \u2192 B is invertible, with inverse f\u22121: B \u2192 A. If a and\n1\na are elements of A such that f(a ) = f(a ), then\n2 1 2\na = f\u22121(f(a )) = f\u22121(f(a )) = a ,\n1 1 2 2\nwhich means that f is injective. For any b in B, note that f\u22121(b) is an element of A,\nwith\nf(f\u22121(b)) = b. 22\nTherefore f is also surjective, so f is a bijection.\nOneconsequenceofthisresultisthatiff: A \u2192 B isabijection, thenf\u22121: B \u2192 A\nis also a bijection. In other words, there is a bijection between A and B if and only\nif there is a bijection between B and A.\n0.4 Cardinality\nWe begin this section with a basic distinction relating to the number of elements\nin a set.\nDefinition 0.15 A set A is finite if either A = \u2205 or there is a bijection f: [n] \u2192 A\nfor some natural number n. Any set that is not finite is called infinite.\nWe will take it as self-evident that the set N, and any set containing N, is infinite.\nOn the other hand, a proper subset of N may be either finite or infinite.\nExample 0.16 Consider the set A = {2,4,8,16}. The function f: [4] \u2192 A given\nby the rule f(k) = 2k is a bijection, which means (as one would have expected) that\nthe set A is finite.\nExample 0.17 Let P denote the subset of N consisting of all prime numbers. We\nclaim that P is infinite. Suppose, to the contrary, that there is a bijection f: [n] \u2192 P\nfor some natural number n. In other words, every prime number can be uniquely\ndesignated f(k) = p for some k in [n]. Consider the natural number\nk\nq = p p \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7p +1.\n1 2 n\nBy assumption, the prime factorization of q must contain a positive power of at least\none p for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Any such p would be a factor of both q and p p \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7p , and\nk k 1 2 n 23\nhence also a factor of q \u2212p p \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7p = 1. Since that is impossible, we conclude that\n1 2 n\nP must be infinite.\nThe cardinality of a finite set A, which we denote |A|, is simply the number of\nelements in A. In other words, if there is a bijection f: [n] \u2192 A, we would say that\n|A| = n. Similarly, we take |\u2205| to be 0. The same concept applies to infinite sets,\nalthough there are certain technical considerations that must be taken into account.\nDefinition 0.18 Consider a pair of sets A and B.\n(1) We say that |A| = |B| if there is a bijection f: A \u2192 B.\n(2) We say that |A| \u2264 |B| if there is an injection g: A \u2192 B.\n(3) We say that |A| < |B| if there is an injection g: A \u2192 B, but no bijection\nf: A \u2192 B.\nFor these definitions to make sense, we would want to know that |A| = |B| when-\never both |A| \u2264 |B| and |B| \u2264 |A|; in other words, there is a bijection f: A \u2192 B\nwhenever there are injections g: A \u2192 B and h: B \u2192 A. This fact, known as the\nSchr\u00a8oder\u2013Bernstein Theorem, is actually true, although we will not attempt to pro-\nvide a proof. (See [1, p. 32] for an outline of the argument.) Theorem 0.25 can be\nviewed as a weaker version of this result.\nExample 0.19 Define the function g: N \u2192 Q by the rule g(n) = n. This function is\nclearly injective (but not surjective), so |N| \u2264 |Q|. Proposition 0.27 will demonstrate\nthat |N| = |Q|.\nExample 0.20 Define the function g: N \u2192 R by the rule g(n) = n. As above, the\ninjectivity of g shows that |N| \u2264 |R|. The question of whether |N| = |R| or |N| < |R|\nwill be addressed in Chapter 1. 24\nWhen we are working with infinite cardinalities, the set N provides a yardstick\nagainst which all other sets are measured.\nDefinition 0.21 A set A is countably infinite if there is a bijection f: N \u2192 A. An\ninfinite set that is not countably infinite is called uncountable or uncountably infinite.\nIn other words, A is countably infinite if and only if |N| = |A|. The term countable\nis often used to describe a set that is either finite or countably infinite. Some authors,\nhowever, take countable to refer only to countably infinite sets, so we will refrain from\nusing this term to avoid ambiguity.\nExample 0.22 Let 2N denote the set of all even natural numbers. Define the\nfunction f: N \u2192 2N by the rule f(k) = 2k. It is easy to verify that this function is\na bijection, which means that N and 2N have the same cardinality. In particular, 2N\nis countably infinite.\nWhile the preceding example is fairly straightforward, it may seem paradoxical\nthat a proper subset of N can have the same cardinality as N. Although such a\nsituation cannot occur in the context of finite sets, it is entirely typical for infinite\nsets.\nExample 0.23 The set Z, consisting of all integers, is countably infinite. Define the\nfunction f: N \u2192 Z by the rule\n\uf8f1\n1\u2212k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 , k odd\n\uf8f2\n2\nf(k) = .\n\uf8f4k\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3 , k even\n2\nThe easiest way to verify that f is bijective is to produce an inverse (see Proposition 25\n0.14). Consider the function g: Z \u2192 N given by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f41\u22122m, m \u2264 0\n\uf8f2\ng(m) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f32m, m \u2265 1\nWe leave it to the reader to verify that g \u25e6 f: N \u2192 N and f \u25e6 g: Z \u2192 Z are the\nidentity maps on their respective sets.\nWhile the argument above is sufficient from a technical perspective, it may be\nhelpful to visualize the bijection more concretely. Writing out the first few terms in\nthe correspondence, we see that\nN: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...\n(cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) ,\nZ: 0 1 \u22121 2 \u22122 3 \u22123 ...\nfrom which the general pattern should be evident.\nIn a sense, we may view any countably infinite set as being a copy of the natural\nnumbers. For such a set A, a bijection f: N \u2192 A can be represented as the list\n(f(1),f(2),f(3),...), which is called an enumeration of A. An enumeration is never\nunique, although in some cases there is a particularly natural way to list the elements\nof A. Examples 0.22 and 0.23, for instance, yield the enumerations (2,4,6,8,10,...)\nfor 2N and (0,1,\u22121,2,\u22122,...) for Z. For other sets, although we know an enumera-\ntion exists, there may be no concrete pattern that is readily apparent.\nThe next two propositions will be useful for demonstrating that a set is countably\ninfinite, particularly when it is difficult to identify a bijection explicitly.\nProposition 0.24 Any infinite subset of N must be countably infinite. 26\nProof. LetAbeaninfinitesubsetofN. Ourgoalistoconstructabijectionf: N \u2192 A.\nSince A consists of positive integers, the Well-Ordering Principle dictates that A\nmust have a smallest element. Let f(1) denote the smallest element of A. Now\nconsider the set A \\ {f(1)}. This set must also have a smallest element, which we\ncall f(2). In general, for k \u2265 1, define f(k +1) to be the smallest element of the set\nA\\{f(1),f(2),...,f(k)}. Since A is infinite, this process never terminates and thus\nthe function f is defined for all k in N.\nThis construction guarantees that f(j) < f(k) whenever j < k, so the function\nf: N \u2192 Aisinjective. ForanarbitraryelementmofA, theremustbeafinitenumber\nof elements of A that are less than m. In particular, if there are k elements in A less\nthan m, then f(k +1) = m. Consequently f: N \u2192 A is also surjective.\nThis result dictates, for example, that the set of prime numbers is countably\ninfinite (see Example 0.17). Moreover, Proposition 0.24 leads to another pair of\ncriteria for showing that a set is countably infinite.\nTheorem 0.25 Let A be an infinite set.\n(1) If there exists an injection g: A \u2192 N, then A is countably infinite.\n(2) If there exists a surjection h: N \u2192 A, then A is countably infinite.\nProof. (1) Suppose g: A \u2192 N is injective and consider the image g(A) \u2286 N. Since g\nis injective, the function g: A \u2192 g(A) is a bijection. Since A is infinite, g(A) is an\ninfinite subset of N with the same cardinality as A. Proposition 0.24 shows that g(A)\nmust be countably infinite, which means that A must also be countably infinite.\n(2) Suppose h: N \u2192 A is surjective. In other words, for an arbitrary element\na of A, there is at least one natural number k such that h(k) = a. There may be 27\nmore than one such k in N for any particular a in A, so define g(a) to be the smallest\nnatural number that is taken by h to a. Thus we have defined a function g: A \u2192 N.\nMoreover, if there are a and b in A such that g(a) = g(b), the definition of g shows\nthat\na = h(g(a)) = h(g(b)) = b.\nTherefore g: A \u2192 N is injective, so part (1) shows that A is countably infinite.\nIn other words, rather than constructing a bijection between A and N, it suffices\nto find either an injection or a surjection (with the appropriate choice of domain and\ncodomain). We will apply this observation to obtain a number of important results.\nProposition 0.26 The Cartesian product N\u00d7N is countably infinite.\nProof. Define the function g: N \u00d7 N \u2192 N by the rule g(j,k) = 2j3k. We simply\nneed to verify that g is an injection. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that\ng(j,k) = g(m,n) for two distinct ordered pairs (j,k) and (m,n) in N \u00d7 N. Hence\n2j3k = 2m3n, which means that some integer greater than or equal to 2 has two\ndistinct prime factorizations. Consequently g must be an injection. Since N \u00d7 N is\nan infinite set, Theorem 0.25 shows that N\u00d7N is countably infinite.\nThe same basic idea allows us to prove a result that will be essential to much of\nour later work.\nProposition 0.27 The set Q of rational numbers is countably infinite.\nProof. Define the function g: Q \u2192 N in the following manner. Any nonzero rational\nnumber r can be written uniquely in the form\n(\u22121)km\nr = ,\nn 28\nwhere m and n are positive integers with no common prime factors and k is either 0\nor 1. Take g(r) = 2k3m5n for r (cid:54)= 0 and g(0) = 203051 = 5. As before, it follows from\nProposition 0.3 that g: Q \u2192 N is injective. Since Q is an infinite set, Theorem 0.25\nshows that Q is countably infinite.\nThe are numerous proofs of Proposition 0.27. While the one we have presented is\ncomparatively straightforward, it does not immediately yield a concrete enumeration\nof Q. Calkin and Wilf [12] discovered a particularly appealing enumeration of the set\nof positive rational numbers. Exercise 0.33 presents another such enumeration.\nOnce again, Propositions 0.26 and 0.27 may seem counterintuitive to someone\nencountering this material for the first time. The Cartesian product N \u00d7 N seems\nsomehow to have a \u201chigher dimension\u201d than N itself. Likewise, Q appears to be more\n\u201cwidely dispersed\u201d than the natural numbers (an assertion that will be made more\nprecise by Theorem 1.7). In many instances, our untutored intuition may need to be\nrefined when we are dealing with issues relating to infinite sets.\nThe cardinality of a collection of sets {A : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} simply refers to the cardinality\n\u03bb\nof the index set \u039b. For example, the collection {A : \u03bb \u2208 {2,4,8,16}} has cardinality\n\u03bb\n4 and the collection {B : k \u2208 Q} has countably infinite cardinality. Since there is\nk\na bijection between any finite set and a set [n], every finite collection of sets can be\nrewritten in terms of an index set [n]. Likewise, every countably infinite collection\nof sets can be reindexed in terms of N. Unless otherwise stated, we will assume that\nany finite collection of sets has the form\n{A : k \u2208 [n]} = {A : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n} = {A ,A ,...,A }\nk k 1 2 n 29\nand that any countably infinite collection of sets has the form\n{A : k \u2208 N} = {A ,A ,A ,...}.\nk 1 2 3\nTheorem 0.25 and Proposition 0.26 allow us to establish an important result relating\nto countably infinite collections of sets.\nProposition 0.28 Let {A ,A ,A ,...} be a countably infinite collection of sets,\n1 2 3\neach of which is countably infinite. The union\n\u221e\n(cid:91)\nA = A\nk\nk=1\nis also countably infinite.\nProof. Since every set A is countably infinite, for each k in N there is a bijection\nk\nf : N \u2192 A . Define the function f: N\u00d7N \u2192 A by the rule\nk k\nf(j,k) = f (j).\nk\nSinceeveryelementofAbelongstoatleastoneofthesetsA andeachf issurjective,\nk k\nthe function f must be a surjection. Proposition 0.26 shows that there must be a\nbijection g: N \u2192 N\u00d7N. Define the function h: N \u2192 A by the rule h = f \u25e6g. Since\ng and f are both surjective, so too is h (see Exercise 0.19). Because A is an infinite\nset, Theorem 0.25 shows that A is countably infinite.\nAt this point, for lack of evidence to the contrary, a reader might wonder whether\nevery infinite set is countably infinite. We conclude this chapter with an example of\nan uncountable set.\nExample 0.29 Let F denote the set of all functions f: N \u2192 {0,1}. To show that F\nis uncountable, we will assume there is a bijection h: N \u2192 F. In other words, every 30\nfunction in F can be uniquely designated h(k) = f for some natural number k. To\nk\nobtain a contradiction, we will construct a function g: N \u2192 {0,1} that is different\nfrom each function f . To that end, define\nk\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f40, whenever f (k) = 1\n\uf8f2 k\ng(k) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f31, whenever f (k) = 0\nk\nInotherwords, g differsfromeachfunctionf inatleastthevalueatthenaturalnum-\nk\nber k. Since g (cid:54)= f for any k, the function h: N \u2192 F is not surjective. Consequently\nk\nF must be uncountable.\nWhile this example may seem somewhat esoteric, the underlying argument is\nextremely versatile. We will encounter other examples of uncountable sets in Chapter\n1, although we will employ a different strategy for determining their cardinality.\nHistorical Notes\n(1) Theterm\u201ccommonnotion\u201d(koina\u00a8\u0152nnoiai)isborrowedfromEuclid\u2019sElements\n(Stoiqe(cid:216)a), where it refers to a particular set of axiomatic assumptions. One of\nthese principles, quoted at the beginning of this chapter, asserts that\nThe whole is greater than the part.\nThis statement can be construed as saying that every set has a greater cardi-\nnality than any of its proper subsets, which is not true for infinite sets.\n(2) De Morgan\u2019s laws are named after Augustus De Morgan (1806\u20131871), although\nseveral earlier writers had stated similar results. For example, William of Ock- 31\nham (c. 1285\u20131347) made an analogous pair of observations in his Summa Log-\nicae, written around 1323.\n\u221a\n(3) While the irrationality of 2 may have been known as early as the 6th century\nBC, the oldest extant hint of a proof appears in the Prior Analytics of Aristotle\n(384\u2013322 BC).\n(4) FrancescoMaurolico(1494\u20131575),alsoknownasFranciscusMaurolycus,isoften\ncredited as being the first person to employ mathematical induction. In his\nArithmeticorum libri duo, written in 1557, he proved a statement similar to\npart a. of Exercise 0.12.\n(5) There are numerous proofs of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality,\nincluding a famous one given by Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789\u20131857) in 1821.\nThe argument presented in Example 0.9, which was published in 1954, is due\nto a remarkably inconspicuous mathematician named Georg Ehlers.\n(6) Bernoulli\u2019s Inequality, presented in Exercise 0.13, appeared in a treatise by\nJacob Bernoulli (1654\u20131705) in 1689. A version of this result had previously\nbeen stated by Isaac Barrow (1630\u20131677) in 1670.\n(7) A proof of the infinitude of the primes, similar to that presented in Example\n0.17, appears in Book IX of Euclid\u2019s Elements.\n(8) The concept of cardinality in the context of infinite sets was almost single-\nhandedly introduced by Georg Cantor (1845\u20131918). For anyone unfamiliar with\nthis topic, Chapters 11 and 12 of [20] provide an accessible overview. 32\n(9) Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) discussed the example presented in Exercise 0.23 in\nhis Two New Sciences in 1638, using it as justification for rejecting a precise\nnotion of infinite cardinality. Many other authors, beginning with Aristotle,\nhad made similar arguments.\n(10) The Schro\u00a8der\u2013Bernstein Theorem is named after Ernst Schr\u00a8oder (1841\u20131902)\nand Felix Bernstein (1878\u20131956), who both independently proved the result in\nthe 1890s. It is sometimes known as the Cantor\u2013Schr\u00a8oder\u2013Bernstein Theorem,\nor some variant thereof.\nExercises\n*Exercise 0.1 If A \u2286 B, show that A\u2229B = A and A\u222aB = B.

The set R, along with\nthe operations of addition and multiplication, constitutes a field. In other words, it\nsatisfies the following conditions: 43\n(f1) Associativity: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) and (ab)c = a(bc) for all a, b, and c in R.\n(f2) Commutativity: a+b = b+a and ab = ba for all a and b in R.\n(f3) Distributivity: a(b+c) = ab+ac for all a, b, and c in R.\n(f4) Identities: There exist distinct elements 0 and 1 in R such that a+0 = a and\na\u00b71 = a for all a in R.\n(f5) Additive inverse: For every a in R, there exists an element \u2212a in R such that\na+(\u2212a) = 0.\n(f6) Multiplicative inverse: For every nonzero a in R, there exists an element a\u22121 in\nR such that a\u00b7a\u22121 = 1.\nMoreover, the following properties hold with regard to the standard order relation:\n(o1) For any pair of elements a and b in R, either a \u2264 b or b \u2264 a (or possibly both).\n(o2) If a \u2264 b and b \u2264 a, then a = b.\n(o3) If a \u2264 b and b \u2264 c, then a \u2264 c.\n(o4) If a \u2264 b, then a+c \u2264 b+c.\n(o5) If a \u2265 0 and b \u2265 0, then ab \u2265 0.\nWe describe R, together with the appropriate operations and order relation, as an\nordered field. The reader would be correct to observe that the set Q of rational\nnumbers, with the same operations and order relation, also constitutes an ordered\nfield. What sets R apart is its behavior with regard to upper and lower bounds. 44\nDefinition 1.1 A nonempty subset A of R is bounded above if there is a real number\nM such that t \u2264 M for all t in A. In this situation, M is called an upper bound for\nA. Likewise, A is bounded below if there is a real number m such that m \u2264 t for all\nt in A, in which case m is called a lower bound for A. A set that is both bounded\nabove and bounded below is called bounded.\nDefinition 1.2 A real number M is called a supremum or least upper bound for a\nnonempty subset A of R if it satisfies two conditions:\n\u2022 The number M is an upper bound for A.\n\u2022 If M(cid:48) is another upper bound for A, then M \u2264 M(cid:48).\nLikewise, a real number m is called an infimum or greatest lower bound for A if:\n\u2022 The number m is a lower bound for A.\n\u2022 If m(cid:48) is another lower bound for A, then m(cid:48) \u2264 m.\nDefinition 1.2 implies that the supremum and infimum of a nonempty set, if they\nexist, are both unique. Suppose that M and M are both suprema for the same\n1 2\nset A. Viewing M as a supremum and M an upper bound, we see that M \u2264 M .\n1 2 1 2\nReversing the roles of M and M , we see that M \u2264 M . An analogous argument\n1 2 2 1\nguarantees the uniqueness of the infimum. We will use the notation supA and infA\nto denote respectively the supremum and infimum of A.\nThere are certainly nonempty subsets of R (including R itself) that have neither\na supremum nor an infimum. Nevertheless, any bounded set must possess both.\nTheorem 1.3 (Supremum Property) Any nonempty subset of R that is bounded\nabove has a supremum in R. 45\nIn the context of this definition, the supremum of a set A must belong to R, but\nnot necessarily to A itself. This property is not an intuitive assumption, but a guiding\nprinciple in the construction of the real numbers (which is beyond the scope of our\npresent discussion). While this condition is typically stated in terms of suprema, it\ncould equivalently be phrased in terms of infima (see Exercise 1.1).\nThe reason analysis is conducted in the context of the real numbers, rather than\nthe rationals, is that Q does not satisfy the Supremum Property. For example, con-\nsider the set\nA = {r \u2208 Q : r2 \u2264 2}.\nNote that A is a nonempty subset of Q that is bounded above (for example, by the\nrational number 2). Nevertheless, it is not difficult to show that A has no supremum\n\u221a\nin Q. Intuitively, the only possible supremum would be 2, which does not belong\nto Q. This issue is treated more formally in Exercise 1.13. Even though they are not\nour primary object of study, the rational numbers will still play an important role in\nour investigation (see Theorem 1.7).\nAs we just mentioned, the supremum of a subset A of R may or may not belong\nto A itself. For example, sup(0,1) and sup[0,1] both equal 1, yet 1 belongs to [0,1]\nbut not to (0,1). In the situation where the supremum of A belongs to A, we refer\nto the supremum as the maximum of A, denoted maxA. Similarly, if the infimum of\na set A belongs to A, we refer to the infimum as the minimum of A, denoted minA.\nAny nonempty finite subset of R must have both a maximum and a minimum (see\nExercise 1.11). The following proposition is helpful in understanding the behavior of\nthe supremum when it is not a maximum. 46\nProposition 1.4 Let M be an upper bound for a nonempty subset A of R. The\nnumber M is the supremum of A if and only if, for every positive number \u03b5, there is\nan element a in A with M \u2212\u03b5 < a \u2264 M.\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that M is the supremum of A. Since M \u2212 \u03b5 < M, the\nnumber M \u2212\u03b5 cannot be an upper bound for A. Hence, by definition, there is some\nelement a in A with M \u2212 \u03b5 < a. Since M is an upper bound for A, we know that\na \u2264 M.\nSuppose then, for everypositive number\u03b5, thereis anainAwithM\u2212\u03b5 < a \u2264 M.\nIn that case, no number less than M can be an upper bound for A. Therefore M is\nless than or equal to every upper bound for A, so M = supA.\nIn other words, even if supA does not belong to A, there is an element of A that\nis arbitrarily close to supA. As one would expect, an analogous result also holds for\ninfima (see Exercise 1.4).\nMany of the fundamental properties of R can be deduced from the Supremum\nProperty. The first would be believable as an axiomatic assumption, although we will\nprovide an explicit proof.\nTheorem 1.5 (ArchimedeanProperty) Foranypositivenumberx, thereisanatural\nnumber n such that 1/n < x < n.\nProof. We will begin by verifying the upper bound for x. Suppose, for the sake of\ncontradiction, that there is a positive number x such that k \u2264 x for all k in N. In\nthat case, x would be an upper bound for the set N. Hence the Supremum Property\ndictates that there is a real number M = supN. Since M \u2212 1 < M, the number\nM \u22121 cannot also be an upper bound for N. Hence there is a natural number k such 47\nthat M \u22121 < k. Therefore M < k+1, which contradicts the assertion that M is the\nsupremum of N. In other words, for any positive x, there must be a natural number\nn such that x < n.\nNow consider the lower bound. First of all, suppose that x \u2265 1, in which case\n1/x \u2264 x. We already know there is a natural number n such that x < n, from which\nit follows that\n1 1\n< \u2264 x < n.\nn x\nOn the other hand, suppose that 0 < x < 1, which means that x < 1/x. There is a\nnatural number n such that 1/x < n, and thus\n1 1\n< x < < n.\nn x\nIn either situation, our initial claim holds.\nAs we are being especially meticulous, we will state the following corollary explic-\nitly.\nCorollary 1.6 For any real number x, there is an integer n such that n\u22121 \u2264 x < n.\nProof. First of all, suppose that x is positive. Define the set A = {k \u2208 N : x < k}.\nBy definition, A is bounded below by x. The Archimedean Property shows that A\nis nonempty, which means that A has an infimum n. We would like to show that\nn\u22121 \u2264 x < n. Since n\u22121 < n, the integer n\u22121 cannot belong to A, which means\nthat n\u22121 \u2264 x. On the other hand, if n itself did not belong to A, then n+1 would\nbe a greater lower bound for A, which is not the case. Hence we conclude that x < n.\nNow consider the situation where x is non-positive. If x is an integer, the result\nholds automatically. If x is not an integer, \u2212x is positive and hence there is a 48\nnatural number m such that m \u2212 1 < \u2212x < m. Setting n = \u2212m + 1, we see that\nn\u22121 < x < n.\nWearenowinapositiontodescribeanessentialaspectoftherelationshipbetween\nQ and R.\nTheorem 1.7 (Density of the Rationals) For any pair of real numbers a and b, with\na < b, there is a rational number r with a < r < b.\nProof. We will begin by determining the denominator for such a rational number r.\nSince b \u2212 a is positive, the Archimedean Property dictates that there is a natural\nnumber n such that\n1\n< b\u2212a. (1.1)\nn\nThe number n will serve as the denominator for r. Note that (1.1) may be rewritten\na < b\u22121/n.\nNow consider the real number na. Corollary 1.6 dictates that there is an integer\nm such that m\u22121 \u2264 na < m. Define the rational number r = m/n. Since na < m\nand n is positive, it follows that a < m/n = r. On the other hand,\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1\nm \u2264 na+1 < n b\u2212 +1 = nb.\nn\nConsequently r = m/n < b.\nAnyone who has not previously encountered this result has, at the very least, been\nexposed to similar concepts. The notion of a decimal approximation, for example,\npresupposes that one can find a rational number that is arbitrarily close to a given\nreal number. The term density has a more technical definition, which we will not\npresently consider. For the moment, it suffices to say that a subset A is dense in R 49\nif there is an element of A between any two distinct real numbers. It is important to\nnote that the set Qc of irrational numbers is also dense in R (see Exercise 1.16).\n1.2 Properties of the Absolute Value\nFor a real number t, the absolute value |t| is defined by the following piecewise\nfunction:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4t, t \u2265 0\n\uf8f2\n|t| = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3\u2212t, t < 0\nIn some settings, |t| is also referred to as the modulus of t. It may seem odd to devote\nan entire section to such a simple concept, but there are several important facts we\nneed to state explicitly. The first relates to multiplication.\nProposition 1.8 If s and t are real numbers, then |st| = |s||t|.\nThis identity can easily be verified by considering a number of separate cases (see\nExercise 1.17). The analogous result for sums is slightly more subtle.\nProposition 1.9 (Triangle Inequality) If s and t are real numbers, then |s + t| \u2264\n|s|+|t|.\nProof. Notethats \u2264 |s|andt \u2264 |t|. Sinces2 = |s|2 andt2 = |t|2 and(s+t)2 = |s+t|2,\nit follows that\n(cid:0) |s|+|t|(cid:1)2\n|s+t|2 = (s+t)2 = s2 +2st+t2 \u2264 |s|2 +2|s||t|+|t|2 = .\nConsequently |s+t| \u2264 |s|+|t|.\nThe triangle inequality gives rise to another inequality, which proves to be equally\nuseful. 50\nProposition 1.10 (Reverse Triangle Inequality) If s and t are real numbers, then\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)|s|\u2212|t|(cid:12) \u2264 |s\u2212t|.\nProof. The reverse triangle inequality should really be viewed as a pair of closely\nrelated inequalities:\n|s|\u2212|t| \u2264 |s\u2212t| (1.2)\nand\n|t|\u2212|s| \u2264 |s\u2212t|. (1.3)\nBoth can be deduced directly from the triangle inequality. In particular, let u = s\u2212t\nand v = t. Since |u+v| \u2264 |u|+|v|, we see that\n|s| \u2264 |s\u2212t|+|t|,\nwhich is equivalent to (1.2). If we take u = t\u2212s and v = s, we obtain\n|t| \u2264 |t\u2212s|+|s|,\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\nwhich is equivalent to (1.3). Since (cid:12)|s|\u2212|t|(cid:12) is simply the larger of |s|\u2212|t| and |t|\u2212|s|,\nwe obtain the desired result.\nIn practice, we will often use either (1.2) or (1.3), rather than the \u201cofficial\u201d version\nof the reverse triangle inequality. Even though the underlying concept is quite simple,\nthe inequalities we have just established are indispensable to the study of analysis.\n1.3 Intervals\nThroughoutthistext, wewillusethesymbolI todenoteanondegenerate interval;\nthat is, a set with any of the following forms:\n(a,b), (a,b], [a,b), [a,b], (a,\u221e), [a,\u221e), (\u2212\u221e,b), (\u2212\u221e,b], (\u2212\u221e,\u221e), 51\nwhere a < b, if applicable. An interval of the form [a,a] is simply the singleton set\n{a}, which we call a degenerate interval. Note that the term interval may refer to a\nray, or even to the entire real line. We describe an interval with two real endpoints\nas bounded, with the length of a bounded interval being the difference between its\nendpoints.\nWe begin with a technical observation relating to the two most important types\nof bounded intervals: (a,b) = {s \u2208 R : a < s < b} and [a,b] = {s \u2208 R : a \u2264 s \u2264 b}.\nProposition 1.11 Let a and b be real numbers, with a < b, and let c = (a+b)/2.\n(1) A real number s belongs to the interval (a,b) if and only if |s\u2212c| < (b\u2212a)/2.\nMoreover, if s and t both belong to (a,b), then |s\u2212t| < b\u2212a.\n(2) A real number s belongs to the interval [a,b] if and only if |s\u2212c| \u2264 (b\u2212a)/2.\nMoreover, if s and t both belong to [a,b], then |s\u2212t| \u2264 b\u2212a.\nProof. (1) Suppose, first of all, that s belongs to the interval (a,b). Thus a < s < b,\nwhich means that a\u2212s < 0 < s\u2212a and s\u2212b < 0 < b\u2212s. Consequently\na+b s\u2212a s\u2212b s\u2212a b\u2212s b\u2212a\ns\u2212 = + < + =\n2 2 2 2 2 2\nand\na+b a\u2212s b\u2212s s\u2212a b\u2212s b\u2212a\n\u2212s = + < + = ,\n2 2 2 2 2 2\nfrom which it follows that |s\u2212c| < (b\u2212a)/2.\nNow suppose that |s \u2212 c| < (b \u2212 a)/2, which is equivalent to saying that both\ns\u2212c < (b\u2212a)/2 and c\u2212s < (b\u2212a)/2. The inequality s\u2212c < (b\u2212a)/2 implies that\na+b b\u2212a\ns < + = b,\n2 2 52\nwhile the inequality c\u2212s < (b\u2212a)/2 shows that\na+b b\u2212a\ns > \u2212 = a.\n2 2\nIn other words, s belongs to the interval (a,b).\nFinally, suppose that s and t both belong to the interval (a,b). Since |s \u2212 c| <\n(b\u2212a)/2 and |t\u2212c| < (b\u2212a)/2, the triangle inequality shows that\n(cid:12) (cid:12) b\u2212a b\u2212a\n|s\u2212t| = (cid:12)(s\u2212c)+(c\u2212t)(cid:12) \u2264 |s\u2212c|+|t\u2212c| < + = b\u2212a,\n2 2\nas we had asserted.\n(2) The proof for an interval of the form [a,b] is identical to the proof for (a,b),\nwith \u201c\u2264\u201d written in place of \u201c<.\u201d Note that this portion of the proposition is still\nvalid when a = b.\nWe will focus much of our attention on intervals of the form [a,b], which we\nrefer to as compact intervals. The topological property of compactness has a much\nmore general definition, but for the moment we will limit ourselves to a few essential\nobservations.\nTheorem 1.12 (Nested Interval Property) If {I : k \u2208 N} is a countably infinite\nk\ncollection of compact intervals, with\nI \u2287 I \u2287 I \u2287 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,\n1 2 3\n(cid:84)\u221e\nthen I is nonempty.\nk=1 k\nProof. Consider a collection of intervals of the form I = [a ,b ], where I \u2287 I for\nk k k k k+1\nall k. The set {a : k \u2208 N} is bounded above by b (and indeed by any right endpoint\nk 1\nb ), so the Supremum Property dictates that {a : k \u2208 N} has a supremum M. Since\nk k 53\nit is an upper bound for {a : k \u2208 N}, we see that a \u2264 M for all k; since it is less\nk k\nthan or equal to every other upper bound for {a : k \u2208 N}, it follows that M \u2264 b\nk k\nfor all k. Consequently M belongs to every interval I = [a ,b ], so the intersection\nk k k\n(cid:84)\u221e\nI is nonempty.\nk=1 k\nThe Nested Interval Property has numerous applications, two of which we will\nnow discuss.\nTheorem 1.13 Any nondegenerate interval I \u2286 R is uncountable.\nProof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a bijection f: N \u2192 I. In\nother words, every point in I can be written uniquely as f(k) for some k in N. Let\nI be a nondegenerate compact subinterval of I that does not contain f(1). (If one\n1\ndoubts whether such a subinterval exists, pick four distinct points a < b < c < d in\nI; the point f(1) cannot belong to both of the subintervals [a,b] and [c,d].) Likewise,\nlet I be a nondegenerate compact subinterval of I that does not contain f(2). In\n2 1\ngeneral, let I be a nondegenerate compact subinterval of I that does not contain\nk k\u22121\nf(k).\nThe Nested Interval Property guarantees that there is a point x in the intersection\n(cid:84)\u221e\nI . Since x belongs to each subinterval I , by definition x (cid:54)= f(k) for any k in\nk=1 k k\nN. Consequently the function f: N \u2192 I is not surjective, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore the interval I is uncountable.\nMuch of our work throughout the text will relate to the concept of a neighborhood,\nanother term for an interval of the form (a,b). In particular, for a real number t and\na positive number \u03b4, we will write V(t,\u03b4) to denote the interval (t\u2212\u03b4,t+\u03b4), which\nwe will call the neighborhood of radius \u03b4 (or length 2\u03b4) centered at t. Proposition 54\n1.11 shows that\nV(t,\u03b4) = {s \u2208 R : |s\u2212t| < \u03b4}.\nIn other words, V(t,\u03b4) is the set of all real numbers whose distance from t is less\nthan \u03b4.\nLet A be a subset of R. A collection of neighborhoods {V(t ,\u03b4 ) : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} is said\n\u03bb \u03bb\nto cover A (or to be a cover for A) if\n(cid:91)\nA \u2286 V(t ,\u03b4 ).\n\u03bb \u03bb\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n(cid:8) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:9)\nIn some cases, there exists a finite subcollection V t ,\u03b4 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n such that\n\u03bb \u03bb\nk k\nn\n(cid:91) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nA \u2286 V t ,\u03b4 ,\n\u03bb \u03bb\nk k\nk=1\n(cid:8) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:9)\nin which case we call V t ,\u03b4 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n a finite subcover of the original cover.\n\u03bb \u03bb\nk k\nThis definition leads to another fundamental property of compact intervals.\nTheorem 1.14 (Heine\u2013Borel Property) Any collection of neighborhoods {V(t ,\u03b4 ) :\n\u03bb \u03bb\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b} that covers a compact interval [a,b] can be reduced to a finite subcover\n(cid:8) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:9)\nV t ,\u03b4 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n .\n\u03bb \u03bb\nk k\nProof. The result clearly holds when a = b, so take a < b. Suppose, for the sake of\ncontradiction, that some interval [a,b] has a cover {V(t ,\u03b4 ) : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} that cannot\n\u03bb \u03bb\nbe reduced to a finite subcover. Let c denote the midpoint (a + b)/2 and consider\nthe subintervals [a,c] and [c,b]. The collection {V(t ,\u03b4 ) : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} covers both\n\u03bb \u03bb\nsubintervals, and for at least one of the two subintervals cannot be reduced to a\nfinite subcover. (If both subintervals had finite subcovers, then so would the original\ninterval [a,b].) Choose such a subinterval without a finite subcover and label it I .\n1\nNote that the length of I is (b\u2212a)/2.\n1 55\nIn a similar manner, one can construct a collection of intervals\n[a,b] \u2283 I \u2283 I \u2283 I \u2283 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,\n1 2 3\nwhere each compact interval I has the property that the cover {V(t ,\u03b4 ) : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b}\nk \u03bb \u03bb\ncannot be reduced to a finite subcover and where the length of I is (b\u2212a)/2k. The\nk\n(cid:84)\u221e\nNested Interval Property guarantees that there is a number x in I . Since x\nk=1 k\nbelongs to [a,b], there is some neighborhood V(t ,\u03b4 ) that contains x.\n\u03bb \u03bb\nLet \u03b4 = \u03b4 \u2212 |x \u2212 t |, which is positive since |x \u2212 t | < \u03b4 . The Archimedean\n\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb\nProperty guarantees that there is a natural number m such that (b\u2212a)/\u03b4 < m, and\nhence\nb\u2212a b\u2212a\n< < \u03b4.\n2m m\nSince x belongs to the corresponding subinterval I , Proposition 1.11 shows that\nm\n|s\u2212x| < \u03b4 for any s in I . Moreover,\nm\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n|s\u2212t | = (cid:12)(s\u2212x)+(x\u2212t )(cid:12) \u2264 |s\u2212x|+|x\u2212t | < \u03b4 +|x\u2212t | = \u03b4\n\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb\nfor all s in I , so I \u2286 V(t ,\u03b4 ). This observation contradicts the fact that no subin-\nm m \u03bb \u03bb\nterval I can be covered by finitely many neighborhoods in the collection {V(t ,\u03b4 ) :\nk \u03bb \u03bb\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b}. Consequently the original cover {V(t ,\u03b4 ) : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} must, in fact, be\n\u03bb \u03bb\nreducible to a finite subcover of [a,b].\nIt is important to note that neither the Nested Interval Property nor the Heine\u2013\nBorel Property holds for non-compact intervals (see Exercises 1.24 and 1.25). 56\n1.4 Sequences and the Cauchy Criterion\nWhile it is often conceptualized in a different manner, a sequence of real numbers\nis simply a function f: N \u2192 R. We usually envision a sequence as a (countably)\ninfinite list, denoting it as (a ) or (a ,a ,a ,...), where a = f(k) for k in N. We are\nk 1 2 3 k\ntypically interested in the long-term behavior of a as k grows larger.\nk\nIn this context, {a : k \u2208 N} constitutes the set of all values attained by the\nk\nsequence (a ); in terms of the function f: N \u2192 R, this set is simply the image f(N).\nk\nWhile (a ) and {a : k \u2208 N} are closely related, there are two primary differences\nk k\nbetween them. First of all, the terms in a sequence have a specified order, while\nthe elements of a set do not. Secondly, a sequence counts repeated instances of the\nsame value as distinct terms, while a set does not. Although (a ) always consists of\nk\n(countably) infinitely many terms, the set {a : k \u2208 N} may actually be finite. Much\nk\nof our discussion will focus on the relationship between (a ) and {a : k \u2208 N}.\nk k\nWe will begin with perhaps the most important definition relating to sequences.\nDefinition 1.15 A sequence (a ) converges to a number x if, for every positive\nk\nnumber \u03b5, there is a natural number K such that |a \u2212x| < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K. If\nk\n(a ) does not converge to any number x, we say that the sequence diverges.\nk\nBefore proceeding further, we need to establish a basic fact.\nProposition 1.16 If a sequence converges, it must converge to a unique number.\nProof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that (a ) converges to two distinct\nk\nnumbersx andx . Considerthepositivenumber\u03b5 = |x \u2212x |/2. Bydefinition, there\n1 2 1 2\nis a natural number K such that |a \u2212x | < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K . Likewise, there is a\n1 k 1 1 57\nnatural number K such that |a \u2212x | < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K . Let K = max{K ,K },\n2 k 2 2 1 2\nso that both properties hold simultaneously. Observe that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n|x \u2212x | = (cid:12)(x \u2212a )+(a \u2212x )(cid:12)\n1 2 1 K K 2\n\u2264 |a \u2212x |+|a \u2212x |\nK 1 K 2\n< \u03b5+\u03b5 = |x \u2212x |,\n1 2\nwhich is impossible. Hence we conclude that (a ) cannot converge to two distinct\nk\nnumbers.\nIn view of this result, it makes sense to refer to the (unique) number to which a\nsequence converges as its limit. We will use the notation lim a to denote the limit\nk\nk\u2192\u221e\nof a sequence (a ).\nk\nExample 1.17 Suppose that (a ) is a constant sequence; that is, (a ) = (\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1,...)\nk k\nfor some constant \u03b1.

For the sake of efficiency, we will defer the proof until\nChapter 5.\nTheorem 5.1 (Algebraic Limit Theorem) If the sequences (a ) and (b ) converge\nk k\nto the numbers a and b respectively, then:\n(1) The sequence (a +b ) converges to a+b.\nk k\n(2) For any constant c, the sequence (ca ) converges to ca.\nk\n(3) The sequence (a b ) converges to ab.\nk k\n(4) The sequence (a /b ) converges to a/b, as long as b (cid:54)= 0 for all k in N and\nk k k\nb (cid:54)= 0.\nAlthoughwecouldspendquiteawhilediscussingDefinition1.15anditsconsequences,\nit is appropriate to move on to our next major concept. 59\nDefinition 1.19 A sequence (a ) is Cauchy if, for every positive number \u03b5, there is\nk\na natural number K such that |a \u2212a | < \u03b5 whenever j \u2265 K and k \u2265 K.\nj k\nThe principal objective of this section is to understand the relationship between\nconvergent sequences and Cauchy sequences. We begin with a fairly straightforward\nobservation.\nProposition 1.20 Every convergent sequence is Cauchy.\nProof. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. If (a ) converges to x, there must be\nk\na natural number K such that |a \u2212x| < \u03b5/2 whenever k \u2265 K. Consequently\nk\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n|a \u2212a | = (cid:12)(a \u2212x)+(x\u2212a )(cid:12)\nj k j k\n\u2264 |a \u2212x|+|a \u2212x|\nj k\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5\n2 2\nwhenever j and k are both greater than or equal to K. In other words, the sequence\n(a ) is Cauchy.\nk\nIt is often simpler to show that a sequence is divergent by demonstrating that it\nis not Cauchy, rather than by appealing directly to Definition 1.15.\nExample 1.21 Consider the sequence (a ) given by the formula\nk\n1+(\u22121)k\u22121\na = .\nk\n2\nIn other words, a = 1 when k is odd and a = 0 when k is even. Note that\nk k\n|a \u2212a | = 1 for any natural number K. Hence, for \u03b5 = 1, there is no K such that\nK+1 K\n|a \u2212a | < \u03b5 whenever j and k are both greater than or equal to K. Consequently\nj k\n(a ) is not Cauchy, so the sequence is divergent.\nk 60\nSpeaking informally, we could describe a sequence as being convergent if its terms\neventually become arbitrarily close to a fixed value. Similarly, a sequence is Cauchy\nif its terms eventually become arbitrarily close to each other. In an intuitive sense,\nwe would expect a Cauchy sequence to converge, as long as there is not a \u201cmissing\nvalue\u201d where its limit should be. There is one more property we need to introduce\nbefore dealing with this issue definitively.\nDefinition 1.22 A sequence (a ) is bounded if there exists a positive constant M\nk\nsuch that |a | \u2264 M for all k in N.\nk\nThis condition is equivalent to there being a pair of real numbers m and M such\nthat m \u2264 a \u2264 M for all k in N. While we often consider this property in terms\nk\nof sequences, it is important to recognize that (a ) being bounded (as a sequence) is\nk\nequivalent to {a : k \u2208 N} being bounded (as a set). This perspective will be helpful\nk\nin understanding the relationship between bounded sequences, convergent sequences,\nand Cauchy sequences. The following result is the first step in an extended argument.\nProposition 1.23 Every Cauchy sequence is bounded.\nProof. Suppose the sequence (a ) is Cauchy. For \u03b5 = 1, there is a natural number K\nk\nsuch that |a \u2212a | < \u03b5 = 1 whenever k \u2265 K and j \u2265 K. In particular, |a \u2212a | < 1\nj k k K\nwhenever k \u2265 K. The reverse triangle inequality shows that\n|a |\u2212|a | \u2264 |a \u2212a | < 1,\nk K k K\nand hence |a | < |a |+1, whenever k \u2265 K.\nk K\nLet M = max{|a |,|a |,...,|a |,|a |+1}. By definition, |a | \u2264 M for 1 \u2264 k \u2264\n1 2 K\u22121 K k\nK \u2212 1. The preceding paragraph shows that |a | < M for k \u2265 K. In other words,\nk\nthe sequence (a ) is bounded.\nk 61\nCorollary 1.24 Every convergent sequence is bounded.\nProof. Proposition 1.20 dictates that every convergent sequence is Cauchy. Proposi-\ntion 1.23 shows that every Cauchy sequence is bounded.\nExample 1.21 demonstrates that not every bounded sequence is either Cauchy or\nconvergent. This issue is slightly more subtle than one might anticipate, as we will\nsee in Chapter 5.\nOur next observation is somewhat technical, although intuitively plausible.\nLemma 1.25 Let A be a nonempty bounded subset of R. If L is a positive constant,\nthen |s\u2212t| \u2264 L for all s and t in A if and only if supA\u2212infA \u2264 L.\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that |s \u2212 t| \u2264 L for all s and t in A. For any positive\nnumber \u03b5, Proposition 1.4 dictates that there is an element a in A with supA\u2212\u03b5/2 <\n1\na . Likewise, Exercise 1.4 shows that there is an a in A with a < infA + \u03b5/2.\n1 2 2\nTherefore\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nsupA\u2212infA < a +\u03b5/2 \u2212 a \u2212\u03b5/2\n1 2\n= a \u2212a +\u03b5\n1 2\n\u2264 |a \u2212a |+\u03b5\n1 2\n\u2264 L+\u03b5.\nSince this inequality holds for every positive number \u03b5, we conclude that supA \u2212\ninfA \u2264 L (see Exercise 1.5).\nOn the other hand, suppose that supA\u2212infA \u2264 L. If s and t belong to A, then\nboth points belong to the interval [infA,supA]. Thus Proposition 1.11 shows that\n|s\u2212t| \u2264 supA\u2212infA \u2264 L. 62\nThe result of Lemma 1.25 no longer holds if we replace both inequalities with\nstrict inequalities (see Exercise 1.22). While not a major impediment, this fact will\ncause a slight complication in the proof of Proposition 1.26.\nRecall that a sequence (a ) is bounded if and only if {a : k \u2208 N} is a bounded\nk k\nset; in other words, {a : k \u2208 N} has both a finite supremum and a finite infimum.\nk\nBuilding on this observation, we will define a collection of subsets of {a : k \u2208 N} and\nk\nexamine the behavior of their suprema and infima. For a natural number m, define\nA = {a : k \u2265 m}, so that A = {a : k \u2208 N} and\nm k 1 k\nA \u2287 A \u2287 A \u2287 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\n1 2 3\nIt is possible to reframe the Cauchy condition in terms of these sets.\nProposition 1.26 Asequence(a )isCauchyifandonlyif,foreverypositivenumber\nk\n\u03b5, there is a natural number K such that supA \u2212infA < \u03b5.\nK K\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that (a ) is Cauchy. Hence, for any positive \u03b5, there is a\nk\nK such that |a \u2212a | < \u03b5/2 whenever j and k are both greater than or equal to K.\nj k\nIn other words, |s\u2212t| < \u03b5/2 for all s and t in A = {a : k \u2265 K}. Thus Lemma 1.25\nK k\ndictates that supA \u2212infA \u2264 \u03b5/2 < \u03b5.\nK K\nOn the other hand, let \u03b5 be a positive number and suppose there is a natural\nnumber K such that supA \u2212infA < \u03b5/2. In that case, Lemma 1.25 shows that\nK K\n|s\u2212t| \u2264 \u03b5/2 < \u03b5 for all s and t in A = {a : k \u2265 K}. Consequently |a \u2212a | < \u03b5\nK k j k\nwhenever j and k are both greater than or equal to K, which means the sequence\n(a ) is Cauchy.\nk\nA reasonable interpretation of Proposition 1.26 is that the property of being 63\nCauchy is a stronger version of boundedness. This observation leads directly to the\nmain result of the section.\nTheorem 1.27 (Cauchy Criterion) A sequence (a ) in R is convergent if and only\nk\nif it is Cauchy.\nProof. We already know from Proposition 1.20 that every convergent sequence is\nCauchy, so suppose that (a ) is Cauchy. For any natural number m, consider the\nk\ncompact interval\nI = [infA ,supA ],\nm m m\nwhere A = {a : k \u2265 m}. Since A \u2287 A for all k, it follows that I \u2287 I\nm k m m+1 m m+1\n(see Exercise 1.2). Hence the Nested Interval Property guarantees that there is an\n(cid:84)\u221e\nelement x in I .\nm=1 m\nWe would like to show that the sequence (a ) converges to x, which will also guar-\nk\nantee that the point x is unique. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Proposition\n1.26 shows that there is a natural number K such that supA \u2212infA < \u03b5. Since\nK K\nx belongs to I = [infA ,supA ], Proposition 1.11 shows that\nK K K\n|s\u2212x| \u2264 supA \u2212infA < \u03b5\nK K\nfor any s in I , and hence for any s in A . Consequently |a \u2212 x| < \u03b5 for k \u2265 K,\nK K k\nwhich means that the sequence (a ) converges to x.\nk\nThefactthattheNestedIntervalPropertyappearsinthisproofisnotanaccident.\nThe Cauchy Criterion does not hold unless we assume some version of the Supremum\nProperty. Indeed, a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers need not converge in Q\n(see Exercise 1.37). 64\n1.5 A Few Remarks on Series\nThe purpose of Section 1.4 was to introduce the basic concept of a sequence and\nto establish the Cauchy Criterion. In no way does it constitute a thorough treatment\nof the material. Chapter 5 will be largely devoted to exploring further properties of\nsequences, including additional conditions that guarantee convergence.\nOne of the principal topics covered in Chapter 5 will be the notion of a series, a\nrigorous method for defining an infinite sum. By its nature, an arithmetic operation\nsuch as addition can only be repeated finitely many times. Sequences provide a\nvehicle for extending such operations to an infinite process. In particular, if we wish\nto evaluate an infinite sum\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\na = a +a +a +...,\nk 1 2 3\nk=1\nwe consider the sequence (s ) of partial sums:\nm\ns = a ,\n1 1\ns = a +a ,\n2 1 2\ns = a +a +a ,\n3 1 2 3\n.\n.\n.\ns = a +a +a +...+a .\nm 1 2 3 m\nEach term s is only a finite sum, and hence is defined in the usual manner. The\nm\nnovelty of a series is that we examine the long-term behavior of the sequence (s ) to\nm\ndetermine the value of the corresponding infinite sum.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nDefinition 1.28 A series a converges to a value L if the corresponding sequence\nk\nk=1 65\nof partial sums (s ) converges to L. If the sequence (s ) diverges, we say that the\nm m\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nseries a diverges.\nk\nk=1\nWe will frequently write\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\na = L\nk\nk=1\nwhen a series converges to L, with the understanding that the equals sign represents a\nlimiting process, rather than an arithmetic identity. We will explore the implications\nof this definition in Chapter 5. For the moment, we will confine ourselves to two\nspecific examples, both of which will figure prominently in Chapter 4.\nExample 1.29 Consider the series\n\u221e\n(cid:88) 1 1 1 1\n= + + +....\n2k 2 4 8\nk=1\nIn this case, any partial sum s may be written\nm\n1 1 1 1\ns = + + +...+ , (1.4)\nm 2 4 8 2m\nso that\n1 1 1\n2s = 1+ + +...+ . (1.5)\nm 2 4 2m\u22121\nSubtracting (1.4) from (1.5), we see that\n1\ns = 1\u2212\nm 2m\nfor any natural number m.\nWe claim that the series converges to 1. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number\nand take M to be a natural number greater than 1/\u03b5. Note that\n1 1 1\n|s \u22121| = < \u2264 < \u03b5\nm 2m m M 66\nwhenever m \u2265 M. In other words, the sequence (s ) converges to 1, so the series\nm\nconverges to 1 as well.\nA similar argument shows that\n\u221e\n(cid:88) \u03b1\n= \u03b1\n2k\nk=1\nfor any constant \u03b1, as the reader should verify.\nWhat makes the series in Example 1.29 so tractable is that there is a particularly\nsimple representation for the partial sums s . In general, we will need to be a bit\nm\nmore resourceful.\nExample 1.30 Consider the series\n\u221e\n(cid:88) 1 1 1\n= 1+ + +...,\nk 2 3\nk=1\nwhich is known as the harmonic series. While it is impractical to find an explicit\nrepresentation for each partial sum s , it is possible to obtain a sufficiently accurate\nm\nestimate.\nRather than examining every partial sum s , we will consider s for each natural\nm 2n\nnumber n. Note that\n1 3\ns = 1+ =\n21\n2 2\nand\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1\ns = 1+ + + > 1+ + + = 2\n22\n2 3 4 2 4 4\nand\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\ns = 1+ + + + + + +\n23\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5\n> 1+ + + + + + + = .\n2 4 4 8 8 8 8 2 67\nIn general,\n1 1 1 1 1 n+2\ns \u2265 1+ +2\u00b7 +4\u00b7 +...+2n\u22121 \u00b7 = 1+n\u00b7 = .\n2n\n2 4 8 2n 2 2\nThereforethesequence(s )isunbounded, soitcannotbeconvergent. Inotherwords,\nm\nthe harmonic series diverges.\nHistorical Notes\n(1) The first known reference to a concept similar to a supremum appears in a\ntreatise by Bernard Bolzano (1781\u20131848), in the passage quoted at the start of\nthis chapter:\nIf a property M does not apply to all values of a variable quantity x\nbut does apply to all values smaller than a certain u, then there is\nalways a quantity U which is the greatest of those of which it can be\nasserted that all smaller x possess the property M.\nRather than the supremum of a set, this construction yields the infimum of the\ncomplement (see Exercise 1.9). Bolzano explicitly noted the distinction between\nthis quantity and a maximum:\nIn the past this false proposition has often been used instead: If a\nproperty M holds, not for all x, but for all x smaller than a certain\nvalue, then there is always some greatest x to which the property M\napplies. This I say is false, as a consequence of the theorem just\nproved. 68\nIn the same treatise, Bolzano stated (and attempted to prove) what is now\ncalled the Cauchy Criterion:\nIf a series of quantities\n1 2 3 n n+r\nFx,Fx,Fx,...,Fx,..., F x,...\nn\nhas the property that the difference between its nth term Fx and\nn+r\nevery later one F x, however far this latter term may be from the\nformer, remains smaller than any given quantity if n has been taken\nlarge enough, then there is always a certain constant quantity, and\nindeed only one, which the terms of this series approach and to which\ntheycancomeasnearaswepleaseiftheseriesiscontinuedfarenough.\nA similar condition was introduced by Augustin-Louis Cauchy in his Cours\nd\u2019analyse, four years after Bolzano\u2019s treatment was published. Unfortunately,\nduetohisgeographicalisolation,Bolzano\u2019scontributionsdidnotinitiallyreceive\nas much attention as they deserved. His work was rediscovered around 1870,\nby which point it was largely a matter of historical interest. (The quotations of\nBolzano\u2019s work, here and elsewhere in the text, come from Russ\u2019s translation\n[50].)\n(2) The uncountabilityofRwasfirstestablishedbyGeorgCantorin1874, although\nhis famous \u201cdiagonalization argument\u201d (similar to that presented in Example\n0.29) did not appear until 1891.\n\u00b4\n(3) The Heine\u2013Borel Property was stated by Emile Borel (1871\u20131956) in his doc-\ntoral thesis, published in 1895. Borel later served in both the French Chamber 69\nof Deputies and the French Resistance. The connection between this result and\nEduard Heine (1821\u20131881) is somewhat more tenuous, having been established\nretroactively. The original proof appears to have been given by Peter Gustav\nLejeune Dirichlet (1805\u20131859), although the relevant work was not published\nuntil 1904. See [19] and [46] for more details.\n(4) Example 1.29 could be viewed as a resolution of Zeno\u2019s infamous dichotomy\nparadox (see [52, pp. 366\u2013375]). The argument given in Example 1.30 was\ndiscovered by the French bishop Nicole Oresme (c. 1320\u20131382), making it one\nof the more venerable proofs presented in this text.\nExercises\n*Exercise 1.1 ForanonemptysubsetAofR, definetheset\u2212A = {t \u2208 R : \u2212t \u2208 A}.\nShow that A is bounded above if and only if \u2212A is bounded below, with inf(\u2212A) =\n\u2212supA.

The treatment in this text\nwill be slightly different. We begin with a remarkably simple definition, which will\ntie together the main concepts presented in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.\nDefinition 2.1 Let A be a subset of R. A function \u03b4(t): A \u2192 R is called a gauge\non A if \u03b4(t) > 0 for all t in A. 77\nThere are no additional conditions imposed on such a function; it simply assigns a\npositive number to each point in A. We will include the argument t for notational\nclarity, except when a gauge is constant. A gauge provides a convenient vehicle for\ndiscussing the behavior of a function over an entire set.\nRecall that we are using the symbol I to denote an arbitrary nondegenerate\ninterval. Unless otherwise noted, we will assume henceforth that the term interval\nrefers only to a nondegenerate interval.\nDefinition 2.2 A function f: I \u2192 R is continuous on a subset A of I if, for every\npositive number \u03b5, there is a gauge \u03b4(t) on A such that\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5\nwhenever the point s belongs to I, the point t belongs to A, and |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t).\nAlthough we will rarely mention this fact explicitly, to avoid a triviality we will\ngenerally assume that A is nonempty.\nDefinition 2.3 A functionf: I \u2192 Rthat is continuous onA \u2286 I is calleduniformly\ncontinuous on A if, for every positive number \u03b5, the corresponding gauge \u03b4(t) can be\ntaken to be a constant function.\nSuppose I is a subinterval of I. While it is a subtle distinction, saying that a\n0\nfunction f: I \u2192 R is continuous on I is different from saying that f: I \u2192 R is\n0 0\ncontinuous on I . In the first case, we only need to consider s when |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t) and\n0\ns belongs to I ; in the second, we need to consider s when |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t) and s belongs\n0\nto I. Thus it is possible for f: I \u2192 R to be continuous on I but for f: I \u2192 R not\n0 0\nto be continuous on I (see Exercise 2.1). The analogous distinction also holds for\n0\nuniform continuity. 78\nIt should be apparent from Definition 2.2 that f: I \u2192 R is continuous on A \u2286 I\nif and only if f is continuous on the singleton set {t} for each t in A (see Exercise 2.2).\nIn general, we say that f: I \u2192 R is continuous at a point t in I if f is continuous on\n{t}. If f is not continuous on {t}, we say that f is discontinuous at t. We define the\nset of continuity C to consist of all points in I at which f is continuous. In essence,\nf\nC is the largest subset A of I that satisfies Definition 2.2 (see Exercise 2.3).\nf\nWhenever we are applying these definitions, we will tacitly assume that s belongs\nto I and t belongs to A. The condition on which we will focus is the proximity of the\ntwo points: in other words, whether |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). In certain instances, particularly\nwhen working with rational functions, we may need to consider a function defined on\nthe union of finitely many intervals I ,I ,...,I (which we can take to be pairwise\n1 2 n\ndisjoint). In such a situation, for a subset A of the domain, we will consider the\ncontinuity of f separately on every set A\u2229I ,A\u2229I ,...,A\u2229I that is nonempty.\n1 2 n\nWe will now consider several concrete examples.\nExample 2.4 It should come as no surprise that a constant function f: I \u2192 R is\ncontinuous on any interval I. Indeed, if f(t) = \u03b1 for all t in I, we see that\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| = |\u03b1\u2212\u03b1| = 0 < \u03b5\nfor any positive number \u03b5, regardless of the gauge \u03b4(t). In particular, any such\nfunction is uniformly continuous on I.\nExample 2.5 For an interval I, consider the function g: I \u2192 I given by the rule\ng(t) = t. For any positive number \u03b5, observe that\n|g(s)\u2212g(t)| = |s\u2212t| < \u03b5 79\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 = \u03b5. In other words, g is uniformly continuous on I.\nExample 2.6 Consider the function h: R \u2192 R given by the rule h(t) = t2. Let \u03b5\nbe an arbitrary positive number and define the gauge\n(cid:26) (cid:27)\n\u03b5\n\u03b4(t) = min ,1 . (2.1)\n2|t|+1\nIf |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), it follows that |s\u2212t| < 1 and |s| < |t|+1. Consequently\n|h(s)\u2212h(t)| = |s2 \u2212t2|\n= |s\u2212t||s+t|\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n\u2264 |s\u2212t| |s|+|t|\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n< \u03b4(t)\u00b7 (|t|+1)+|t|\n\u03b5\n\u2264 \u00b7(2|t|+1) = \u03b5\n2|t|+1\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Hence h is continuous on R.\nObserve, however, that the gauge \u03b4(t) defined in (2.1) is not constant. Consider a\nbounded interval I; that is, I \u2286 [\u2212R,R] for some positive number R. Since |t| \u2264 R\nfor any t in I, it follows that\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n\u2264 .\n2R+1 2|t|+1\nHence we may replace \u03b4(t) with the constant function\n(cid:26) (cid:27)\n\u03b5\n\u03b4 = min ,1 ,\n2R+1\nwhich means that h is uniformly continuous on any bounded interval.\nFinally, wewillshowthathisnotuniformlycontinuousonanyunboundedinterval\nI. In this case, for any positive constant \u03b4, there is a t in I with\n1 \u03b4\n|t| \u2265 + .\n\u03b4 4 80\nDefine s = t\u2212\u03b4/2.

Thus h is not uniformly continuous on I.\nExample 2.7 Consider the function i: (0,1) \u2192 R defined by the rule i(t) = 1/t.\nFor an arbitrary positive number \u03b5, define the gauge\n(cid:26) t2\u03b5 t(cid:27)\n\u03b4(t) = min , .\n2 2\nIf |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), then |s\u2212t| < t/2 and hence s > t/2. Consequently\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)1 1(cid:12)\n|i(s)\u2212i(t)| = (cid:12) \u2212 (cid:12)\n(cid:12)s t(cid:12)\n|s\u2212t|\n=\nst\n2|s\u2212t|\n\u2264\nt2\n2\u03b4(t)\n<\nt2\n2 t2\u03b5\n\u2264 \u00b7 = \u03b5\nt2 2\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Therefore i is continuous on (0,1).\nWhile the gauge \u03b4(t) in Example 2.7 is clearly non-constant, it is not apparent\nwhether the function i is uniformly continuous on (0,1). Although we could provide 81\nan ad hoc answer to this question, it would be more efficient to hold out for a more\ngeneral result (see Proposition 2.15 below).\nIn each example we have encountered so far, every function has been continu-\nous (although not necessarily uniformly continuous) on its entire domain. The next\nexamples illustrate a different situation.\nExample 2.8 The Dirichlet function d: [0,1] \u2192 R is defined by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f41, t \u2208 Q\u2229[0,1]\n\uf8f2\nd(t) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, t \u2208 Qc \u2229[0,1]\nWe claim that d is discontinuous at every point in [0,1], so that C = \u2205. Let t be\nd\nan arbitrary point in [0,1] and consider any gauge \u03b4(t) on {t} (that is, any positive\nconstant\u03b4). Iftisrational,takestobeanirrationalnumberwitht < s < min{t+\u03b4,1}\n(or with max{t \u2212 \u03b4,0} < s < t, if t = 1); if t is irrational, take s to be a rational\nnumber with t < s < min{t+\u03b4,1}. In either case, |s\u2212t| < \u03b4, but\n|d(s)\u2212d(t)| = 1.\nHence, for \u03b5 = 1, there is no gauge \u03b4 on {t} such that |d(s) \u2212 d(t)| < \u03b5 whenever\n|s\u2212t| < \u03b4. In other words, d is not continuous at any point t in [0,1].\n2.2 Properties of Continuous Functions\nAs one might imagine, it would be tedious to use Definitions 2.2 and 2.3 to verify\ndirectly whether every function is continuous or uniformly continuous. The following\nresults provide a much-needed shortcut. 82\nProposition 2.9 If f: I \u2192 R and g: I \u2192 R are both continuous on A \u2286 I, then:\n(1) The function f+g is continuous on A. If f and g are both uniformly continuous\non A, then so is f +g.\n(2) The function \u03b1f is continuous on A for any constant \u03b1. If f is uniformly\ncontinuous on A, then so is \u03b1f.\nProof. (1) Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since f and g are both continuous\non A, there exist gauges \u03b4 (t) and \u03b4 (t) on A such that\n1 2\n\u03b5\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| <\n2\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t) and\n1\n\u03b5\n|g(s)\u2212g(t)| <\n2\nwhenever |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4 (t). Define the gauge \u03b4(t) = min{\u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t)}, so that both\n2 1 2\nproperties hold simultaneously. Observe that\n(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) f(s)+g(s) \u2212 f(t)+g(t) (cid:12) = (cid:12) f(s)\u2212f(t) + g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12)\n\u2264 |f(s)\u2212f(t)|+|g(s)\u2212g(t)|\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5\n2 2\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Consequently f +g is also continuous on A.\nIf both of the gauges \u03b4 (t) and \u03b4 (t) are constant on A, then so is the gauge\n1 2\n\u03b4(t) = min{\u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t)}. Therefore f+g is uniformly continuous on A whenever both\n1 2\nf and g are uniformly continuous.\n(2) Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since f is continuous on A, there exists\na gauge \u03b4(t) on A such that\n\u03b5\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| < (2.2)\n|\u03b1|+1 83\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Hence\n|\u03b1f(s)\u2212\u03b1f(t)| = |\u03b1||f(s)\u2212f(t)|\n\u03b5\n\u2264 |\u03b1|\u00b7 < \u03b5\n|\u03b1|+1\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Consequently \u03b1f is also continuous on A.\nIff isuniformlycontinuousonA, thenthegauge\u03b4(t)maybetakentobeconstant,\nwhich means that \u03b1f is also uniformly continuous on A.\nWe will frequently define a new gauge as being the minimum of a finite number\nof other gauges, as we did in the first part of this proof. This technique will generally\nallowustoconstructasinglegaugethatpossessestheattributesofeachoftheoriginal\ngauges. The attentive reader might wonder why we took the denominator in (2.2)\nto be |\u03b1| + 1, rather than just |\u03b1|. The \u201c+1\u201d is included to prevent division by 0,\nto avoid treating \u03b1 = 0 as a separate case. We will occasionally employ this type of\ntrick when it serves to simplify an argument.\nThenextresultissimilarinspirit, althoughtheproofisslightlymorecomplicated.\nProposition 2.10 If f: I \u2192 R and g: I \u2192 R are both continuous on A \u2286 I, then:\n(1) The function fg is continuous on A.\n(2) The function f/g is continuous on the set A\\Z, where Z = {s \u2208 A : g(s) = 0}.\nProof. (1) If fg is continuous on every singleton set {t}, for all t in A, then fg is\ncontinuous on A (see Exercise 2.2). Hence, for the purposes of this proof, we will\nsimply show that fg is continuous on a singleton set A = {t}.\nLet \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and define the positive number\n\u03b5\n\u03b5 = .\nt\n|f(t)|+|g(t)|+1 84\nSince f is continuous on A, there is a gauge \u03b4 on A = {t} such that\n1\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| < min{\u03b5 ,1}\nt\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 . Likewise, there is a gauge \u03b4 on {t} such that\n1 2\n|g(s)\u2212g(t)| < \u03b5\nt\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 . Define the gauge \u03b4 on {t} by setting \u03b4 = min{\u03b4 ,\u03b4 }. Observe\n2 1 2\nthat |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < 1 whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4, and thus |f(s)| < |f(t)|+1. Consequently\n(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:12)\n|f(s)g(s)\u2212f(t)g(t)| = (cid:12) f(s)g(s)\u2212f(s)g(t) + f(s)g(t)\u2212f(t)g(t) (cid:12)\n\u2264 |f(s)||g(s)\u2212g(t)|+|g(t)||f(s)\u2212f(t)|\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n\u2264 |f(t)|+1 |g(s)\u2212g(t)|+|g(t)||f(s)\u2212f(t)|\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n< |f(t)|+1 \u03b5 +|g(t)|\u03b5\nt t\n\u03b5\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n= |f(t)|+|g(t)|+1 \u00b7 = \u03b5\n|f(t)|+|g(t)|+1\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. Therefore the product fg is continuous on A = {t}.\n(2) We will simplify this argument somewhat by considering the function 1/g,\ninvoking part (1) to obtain the desired result for f/g. As in the previous case, we\nwill take A\\Z to be a singleton set {t}, with the stipulation that g(t) (cid:54)= 0. Let \u03b5 be\nan arbitrary positive number and define the positive number\n(cid:26) |g(t)|2\u03b5 |g(t)|(cid:27)\n\u03b5 = min , .\nt\n2 2\nSince g is continuous on A\\Z = {t}, there is a gauge \u03b4 on {t} such that\n|g(s)\u2212g(t)| < \u03b5\nt\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. Note that\n|g(t)|\n|g(s)\u2212g(t)| < \u03b5 \u2264\nt\n2 85\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4, and hence |g(s)| > |g(t)|/2. Thus g(s) (cid:54)= 0 and\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) 1 1 (cid:12) |g(s)\u2212g(t)|\n(cid:12) \u2212 (cid:12) =\n(cid:12)g(s) g(t)(cid:12) |g(s)g(t)|\n2|g(s)\u2212g(t)|\n\u2264\n|g(t)|2\n2\u03b5\nt\n<\n|g(t)|2\n2 |g(t)|2\u03b5\n\u2264 \u00b7 = \u03b5\n|g(t)|2 2\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. Consequently the reciprocal 1/g is continuous on A\\Z = {t},\nas is the quotient f/g.\nIt should not be surprising that the second half of this proof closely resembles the\nargument from Example 2.7. Since both portions of the proof focused on singleton\nsets, there is no indication whether f and g being uniformly continuous on a larger\nset would translate to fg or f/g. Exercises 2.14 to 2.17 explore the issue of uniform\ncontinuity for products and quotients.\nAn immediate consequence of Propositions 2.9 and 2.10, along with Examples\n2.4 and 2.5, is that any polynomial is continuous on R and any rational function is\ncontinuous on R\\Z, where Z denotes the finite set on which the denominator of the\nrational function is 0.\nOur next result allows us to combine continuous functions in a different manner.\nLemma 2.11 (Pasting Lemma) Suppose f: [a,b] \u2192 R is continuous on [a,b] and\ng: [b,c] \u2192 R is continuous on [b,c], where a < b < c. If f(b) = g(b), the function\nh: [a,c] \u2192 R given by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4f(t), a \u2264 t \u2264 b\n\uf8f2\nh(t) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3g(t), b < t \u2264 c 86\nis continuous on [a,c].\nProof. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since f is continuous on [a,b], there is\na gauge \u03b4 (t) on [a,b] such that |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5 whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t), for s and t\n1 1\nin [a,b]. Likewise, there is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on [b,c] such that |g(s)\u2212g(t)| < \u03b5 whenever\n2\n|s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t), for s and t in [b,c]. Define the gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,c] as follows:\n2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4min{\u03b4 (t),b\u2212t}, a \u2264 t < b\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b4(t) = .\nmin{\u03b4 (b),\u03b4 (b)}, t = b\n1 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3min{\u03b4 (t),t\u2212b}, b < t \u2264 c\n2\nSuppose, first of all, that t belongs to [a,b) and that |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Thus |s\u2212t| < b\u2212t,\nso s < b. Hence the fact that |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t) guarantees that\n1\n|h(s)\u2212h(t)| = |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5.\nLikewise, suppose that t belongs to (b,c] and that |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Hence |s\u2212t| < t\u2212b,\nso s > b. As before, the fact that |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t) guarantees that\n2\n|h(s)\u2212h(t)| = |g(s)\u2212g(t)| < \u03b5.\nFinally, consider the case where t = b. Suppose that |s\u2212b| < \u03b4(b). If s \u2264 b, the fact\nthat |s\u2212b| < \u03b4 (b) guarantees that\n1\n|h(s)\u2212h(b)| = |f(s)\u2212f(b)| < \u03b5.\nIf s > b, the fact that |s\u2212b| < \u03b4 (b) guarantees that\n2\n|h(s)\u2212h(b)| = |g(s)\u2212f(b)| = |g(s)\u2212g(b)| < \u03b5.\nIn any of these situations, |h(s)\u2212h(t)| < \u03b5 whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), so the function h\nis continuous on [a,c]. 87\nBased on the proof above, it is not obvious whether this \u201cpasting process\u201d yields a\nuniformly continuous function h: [a,c] \u2192 R whenever f: [a,b] \u2192 R and g: [a,b] \u2192 R\nare both uniformly continuous. This question will be answered in a somewhat more\ndirect manner by Theorem 2.16.\nThe Pasting Lemma can be applied multiple times, so that n continuous functions\nf : [x ,x ] \u2192 R,\n1 0 1\nf : [x ,x ] \u2192 R,\n2 1 2\n.\n.\n.\nf : [x ,x ] \u2192 R,\nn n\u22121 n\nwith f (x ) = f (x ) for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1, can be \u201cpasted together\u201d to form a\nk k k+1 k\ncontinuous function on [x ,x ].\n0 n\nExample 2.12 Consider the function f: [\u22121,5] \u2192 R given by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f43t2 \u221217, \u22121 \u2264 t \u2264 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nf(t) = .\n2t\u22129, 2 < t \u2264 4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f315\u2212t2, 4 < t \u2264 5\nWe may view f as consisting of three continuous functions,\nf : [\u22121,2] \u2192 R,\n1\nf : [2,4] \u2192 R,\n2\nf : [4,5] \u2192 R,\n3\nwith f (2) = f (2) and f (4) = f (4). Hence the Pasting Lemma dictates that f is\n1 2 2 3\ncontinuous on [\u22121,5]. 88\nThe reader should be aware, though, that \u201cpasting together\u201d infinitely many con-\ntinuous functions does not always result in a continuous function (see Example 2.21).\nThe final result of this section is not only useful for verifying continuity, but also\nfor demonstrating discontinuity.\nProposition 2.13 (Sequential Characterization of Continuity) Consider a function\nf: I \u2192 R. A point t in I belongs to the set of continuity C if and only if, for every\nf\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nsequence (s ) of points in I converging to t, the sequence f(s ) converges to f(t).\nk k\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that t belongs to C . Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive\nf\nnumber and consider a sequence (s ) converging to t. Since f is continuous on the\nk\nsingleton set {t}, there is a gauge \u03b4 on {t} such that |f(s) \u2212 f(t)| < \u03b5 whenever\n|s\u2212t| < \u03b4. By definition, there must be a natural number K such that |s \u2212t| < \u03b4\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Hence |f(s )\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K, so the sequence f(s )\nk k\nconverges to f(t).\nSuppose then that t does not belong to C . Hence, for some positive \u03b5, there is no\nf\ngauge \u03b4 on {t} for which the condition |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 guarantees that |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5.\nIn other words, for each gauge \u03b4 on {t}, there is some s in I for which |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4\nbut |f(s)\u2212f(t)| \u2265 \u03b5. For every natural number k, consider the gauge \u03b4 = 1/k on\nk\n{t}. As we just observed, there must be a point s in I with |s \u2212 t| < 1/k and\nk k\n|f(s )\u2212f(t)| \u2265 \u03b5. Viewing (s ) as a sequence, we see that (s ) converges to t, but\nk k k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nf(s ) does not converge to f(t).\nk\nExample 2.14 Consider the function g: [\u22121,1] \u2192 R defined by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4t, t \u2208 Q\u2229[\u22121,1]\n\uf8f2\ng(t) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3\u2212t, t \u2208 Qc \u2229[\u22121,1] 89\nWe claim that the set of continuity C is precisely {0}. Suppose, first of all, that t is a\ng\nnonzeronumberin[\u22121,1]. Exercise1.38showsthatthereisasequence(r )ofrational\nk\nnumbers in [\u22121,1] that converges to t and a sequence (q ) of irrational numbers in\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n[\u22121,1]thatconvergestot. Sinceg(r ) = r , thesequence g(r ) converges tot; since\nk k k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\ng(q ) = \u2212q , the sequence g(q ) converges to \u2212t. Consequently it is impossible for\nk k k\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\ng(r ) and g(q ) both to converge to g(t), so t does not belong to C .\nk k g\nNow consider the point 0. If a sequence (s ) converges to 0, Exercise 1.29 shows\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nthat |g(s )| = (|s |) converges to 0, as does the sequence g(s ) . Therefore 0\nk k k\nbelongs to C , so C = {0}.\ng g\n2.3 Continuity on Compact Intervals\nThis section presents some of the distinctive properties of a continuous function\non a compact interval [a,b]. Our first result actually pertains to all bounded intervals.\nProposition 2.15 If f: I \u2192 R is uniformly continuous on a bounded interval I,\nthen f is bounded on I.\nProof. Taking \u03b5 = 1, we know there is a constant gauge \u03b4 such that |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < 1,\nor equivalently\nf(t)\u22121 < f(s) < f(t)+1,\nwhenever |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4. Let a and b denote the endpoints of I, which may or may\nnot belong to I. Since the interval I is bounded, we may choose a finite set of\npoints {x ,x ,...,x } in I, such that x \u2212a < \u03b4 and b\u2212x < \u03b4 and x \u2212x < \u03b4\n1 2 n 1 n k k\u22121\nfor 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Thus every point in I lies within \u03b4 of at least one point x . Let\nk\nM = max{f(x ) : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n} and m = min{f(x ) : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n}. For any s in I,\nk k 90\nsince |s\u2212x | < \u03b4 for some k, we see that\nk\nm\u22121 \u2264 f(x )\u22121 < f(s) < f(x )+1 \u2264 M +1.\nk k\nConsequently f is bounded on I.\nIn particular, this result shows that the function i: (0,1) \u2192 R introduced in\nExample 2.7 is not uniformly continuous on (0,1).\nWhile uniform continuity is generally a stronger condition than continuity, in\none instance the two properties overlap. The following result reflects the distinctive\nnature of compact intervals, as exemplified by the Nested Interval Property and the\nHeine\u2013Borel Property.\nTheorem 2.16 Any function that is continuous on a compact interval [a,b] must\nbe uniformly continuous on [a,b].\nProof. Suppose f: [a,b] \u2192 R is continuous and let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number.\nThusthereisagauge\u03b4(t)on[a,b]suchthat|f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5/2whenever|s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t).\n(cid:8) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:9)\nConsider the collection of neighborhoods V t,\u03b4(t)/2 : t \u2208 [a,b] , which constitutes\nan open cover for [a,b]. The Heine\u2013Borel Property guarantees that there is a finite\n(cid:8) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:9)\nsubcollection V t ,\u03b4(t )/2 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n that covers [a,b]; that is, every t in [a,b]\nk k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nbelongs to at least one neighborhood V t ,\u03b4(t )/2 .\nk k\nLet \u03b4 = min{\u03b4(t )/2 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n} and suppose that |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. Since t belongs\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nto a neighborhood V t ,\u03b4(t )/2 , we know that |t\u2212t | < \u03b4(t )/2 for a particular k;\nk k k k 91\nsince s is within \u03b4 of t, it follows that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n|s\u2212t | = (cid:12)(s\u2212t)+(t\u2212t )(cid:12)\nk k\n\u2264 |s\u2212t|+|t\u2212t |\nk\n\u03b4(t ) \u03b4(t ) \u03b4(t )\nk k k\n< \u03b4 + \u2264 + = \u03b4(t ).\nk\n2 2 2\nHence both s and t lie within \u03b4(t ) of the same point t , so\nk k\n(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:12)\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| = (cid:12) f(s)\u2212f(t ) + f(t )\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\nk k\n\u2264 |f(s)\u2212f(t )|+|f(t)\u2212f(t )|\nk k\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5.\n2 2\nTherefore f is uniformly continuous on [a,b].\nWhile the equivalence of continuity and uniform continuity in this setting may\nseem somewhat technical, it has several important consequences. Our next result\nmay be considered one of the fundamental properties of continuous functions.\nTheorem 2.17 (Extreme Value Theorem) A continuous function f: [a,b] \u2192 R must\nattain both a minimum and maximum on [a,b]. In other words, there is a pair of\npoints x and x in [a,b] with f(x ) \u2264 f(t) \u2264 f(x ) for all t in [a,b].\n1 2 1 2\nProof. Proposition 2.15 and Theorem 2.16 guarantee that the set f([a,b]) is bounded.\nLet m and M denote respectively the infimum and supremum of f([a,b]). Suppose,\nfor the sake of contradiction, that f does not attain the value m; that is, there is no\nx in [a,b] such that f(x ) = m. Hence the quantity f(t)\u2212m is positive for all t in\n1 1\n[a,b], so Propositions 2.9 and 2.10 dictate that g: [a,b] \u2192 R given by the rule\n1\ng(t) =\nf(t)\u2212m 92\nis continuous on [a,b]. Thus Theorem 2.16 dictates that g is uniformly continuous\non [a,b], so Proposition 2.15 guarantees that g is bounded above by some positive\nconstant C. Consequently\n1\nf(t) \u2265 m+\nC\nfor all t in [a,b], which contradicts the fact that m is the infimum of f([a,b]). In other\nwords, f(x ) must equal m for some x in [a,b], so m is the minimum value of f on\n1 1\nthe interval [a,b].\nWe can apply an analogous argument to show that f attains the maximum value\nM at a point x in [a,b], or simply note that the continuous function \u2212f attains the\n2\nminimum value \u2212M at a point in [a,b].\nWe conclude this section with a result that clarifies the connection between con-\ntinuous functions defined on a bounded interval and continuous functions defined on\na compact interval.\nTheorem 2.18 Acontinuousfunctionf: (a,b) \u2192 Rcanbeextendedtoacontinuous\nfunction f: [a,b] \u2192 R if and only if f is uniformly continuous on (a,b).\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that f: (a,b) \u2192 R can be extended to a continuous\nfunctiononf: [a,b] \u2192 R. Theorem2.16dictatesthatf: [a,b] \u2192 Rmustbeuniformly\ncontinuous on [a,b]. Since a constant gauge on [a,b] is also a constant gauge on (a,b),\nthe original function f: (a,b) \u2192 R must be uniformly continuous on (a,b).\nSuppose then that f: (a,b) \u2192 R is uniformly continuous on (a,b). Our task is to\ndefine the values of f(a) and f(b), and to demonstrate that the resulting function is\ncontinuous on the larger interval.\nLet (s ) be a sequence of points in (a,b) that converges to the endpoint a and let\nk\n\u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since f is uniformly continuous on (a,b), there is 93\na constant gauge (that is, a positive number) \u03b4 such that |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5 for s and\nt in (a,b), whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. Since the sequence (s ) converges, it is also Cauchy.\nk\nHence there is a natural number K such that |s \u2212 s | < \u03b4 whenever j and k are\nj k\nboth greater than or equal to K. Consequently |f(s )\u2212f(s )| < \u03b5 whenever j and k\nj k\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nare both greater than K, so the sequence f(s ) is also Cauchy. Thus f(s ) must\nk k\nconverge to some real number, which we will call f(a).\nBefore proceeding further, we need to demonstrate that the value of f(a) is well-\ndefined. In other words, if (t ) is another sequence of points in (a,b) that converges to\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\na, the sequence f(t ) also converges to f(a). Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number.\nk\nAs above, there is a constant gauge \u03b4 such that |f(s)\u2212f(t)| < \u03b5 whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4.\nSince the sequence (s \u2212t ) converges to 0, there is a natural number K such that\nk k\n|s \u2212 t | < \u03b4 whenever k \u2265 K; hence |f(s ) \u2212 f(t )| < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K. Since\nk k k k\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nf(s ) converges to f(a), it follows from Exercise 1.30 that f(t ) also converges\nk k\nto f(a).\nWe use an analogous argument to determine the value of f(b). All that remains\nto be demonstrated is that f: [a,b] \u2192 R is continuous on [a,b]. By construction, any\nsequence (s ) of points in (a,b) that converges either to a or b has the property that\nk\n(cid:0) f(s )(cid:1) converges to f(a) or f(b) respectively. Since f: (a,b) \u2192 R is continuous,\nk\nProposition 2.13 guarantees that any sequence (s ) of points in (a,b) that converges\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nto t in (a,b) has the property that f(s ) converges to f(t). None of these facts will\nk\nchange if we allow the sequence (s ) also to include terms belonging to the set {a,b}.\nk\nTherefore Proposition 2.13 dictates that f: [a,b] \u2192 R is continuous on [a,b]. 94\n2.4 The Intermediate Value Property\nStudentsareoftenintroducedtotheconceptofcontinuitywiththeintuitive(albeit\nnot entirely accurate) explanation that one can sketch the graph without \u201ctaking the\nchalk off the blackboard.\u201d Our next result provides a somewhat more precise version\nof that statement.\nTheorem 2.19 (Intermediate Value Theorem) Suppose f: I \u2192 R is continuous\non I. Let c and d be points in I, with c < d. If either f(c) < L < f(d) or\nf(c) > L > f(d), then there is a point x in the interval (c,d) with f(x) = L.\nProof. We will begin by considering a special case. Suppose g: I \u2192 R is a continuous\nfunction with g(c) < 0 < g(d). We would like to find a point x in (c,d) for which\ng(x) = 0. To that end, consider the set N = {t \u2208 [c,d] : g(t) < 0}, which is nonempty\n(containing c) and bounded above (by d). Let x denote the supremum of N. Our\ngoal is to show that g(x) = 0.\nSuppose, to the contrary, that g(x) < 0. In that case, \u03b5 = \u2212g(x)/2 is a positive\nnumber, so there is a gauge \u03b4(t) on I such that |g(s) \u2212 g(t)| < \u2212g(x)/2 whenever\n|s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). It follows that\ng(x) g(x)\ng(s) < g(x)\u2212 = < 0\n2 2\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nwhenever x\u2212\u03b4(x) < s < x+\u03b4(x). In particular, g x+\u03b4(x)/2 < 0, so x is not an\nupper bound for the set N.\nSuppose then that g(x) > 0. Hence \u03b5 = g(x)/2 is a positive number, so there is\na corresponding gauge \u03b4(t) such that |g(s)\u2212g(t)| < g(x)/2 whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t).\nConsequently\ng(x) g(x)\ng(s) > g(x)\u2212 = > 0\n2 2 95\nwhenever x\u2212\u03b4(x) < s < x+\u03b4(x). In other words, any number greater than x\u2212\u03b4(x)\ndoes not belong to the set N, so x\u2212\u03b4(x) is a lesser upper bound for N than x.\nFrom the arguments above, we conclude that g(x) must be 0, which implies that\nc < x < d. We may obtain the general result by taking g(t) = f(t) \u2212 L when\nf(c) < L < f(d) or g(t) = L\u2212f(t) when f(c) > L > f(d).\nThe Intermediate Value Theorem has many applications, one of which we have\npreviously mentioned.\nCorollary 2.20 Let x be a non-negative real number. For any natural number n,\nthere is a unique non-negative number y such that yn = x.\nProof. Wewillbeginbydemonstratingtheexistenceofsuchanumbery. Since0n = 0\nand 1n = 1, we may assume that x does not belong to the set {0,1}. Suppose that\n0 < x < 1 and consider the polynomial f: R \u2192 R given by the rule f(t) = tn \u2212 x.\nNote that f(0) = \u2212x < 0 and f(1) = 1 \u2212 x > 0. Since f is continuous on R, the\nIntermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there is a point y in (0,1) such that\nf(y) = yn \u2212x = 0, which means that yn = x.\nIf x > 1, we may apply the preceding argument to the number 1/x to obtain a\npoint w in (0,1) such that wn = 1/x. If we take y = 1/w, it follows that 1/y > 1 and\nyn = x.\nWe will now verify the uniqueness of y. Suppose there are two non-negative\nnumbers y and y , with y \u2264 y , such that yn = yn = x. In that case, Example\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n0.8 shows that yn \u2212 yn \u2265 (y \u2212 y )n. Therefore 0 \u2265 (y \u2212 y )n \u2265 0, from which we\n2 1 2 1 2 1\nconclude that y = y .\n1 2\n\u221a\nThis unique number y, denoted either n x or x1/n, is referred to as the nth root of 96\nx. A similar argument demonstrates the existence of nth roots of negative numbers,\nas long as n is odd (see Exercise 2.25). Let r = m/n be a rational number, where\nthe integer m and the natural number n have no common prime factors; we take\nxr = (x1/n)m for any values of x for which x1/n is defined, excluding x = 0 if m is\nnegative.\nIt would be tempting to conjecture that the converse of the Intermediate Value\nTheorem holds as well. To be precise, we say that a function f: I \u2192 R satisfies the\nintermediate value property on I if, for any points c and and d in I with c < d, there\nis an x in (c,d) with f(x) = L whenever f(c) < L < f(d) or f(c) > L > f(d). Our\nintuition might suggest that this property is a defining characteristic of continuous\nfunctions, but that would actually be incorrect. In fact, there are many functions\nwhich satisfy this property that are not continuous on I.\nExample 2.21 Define the function h: [0,1] \u2192 R as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f43kt\u22121, 1/3k < t \u2264 2/3k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nh(t) = 3\u22123kt, 2/3k < t \u2264 1/3k\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, t = 0\nfor all k in N. For any subinterval [1/3k,1/3k\u22121], this function attains the minimum\nvalue 0 at both endpoints and the maximum value 1 at the midpoint. The Pasting\nLemma shows that h: [1/3k,1/3k\u22121] \u2192 R is continuous on [1/3k,1/3k\u22121] for any k,\nand hence that h: [1/3m,1] \u2192 R is continuous on [1/3m,1] = (cid:83)m [1/3k,1/3k\u22121] for\nk=1\nanynaturalnumberm. Thush: [0,1] \u2192 Riscontinuousontheset(0,1](seeExercise\n2.27). Proposition 2.13 shows, however, that h: [0,1] \u2192 R is not continuous on [0,1].\nIn particular, the sequence (2/3k) converges to 0, but h(2/3k) = 1 for all k; hence the 97\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nsequence h(2/3k) converges to 1, which is not the value of h(0). In other words,\nC = (0,1].\nh\n1\n1 1 2 1 2\n1\n27 9 9 3 3\nFigure 2.1: The function h from Example 2.21.\nNevertheless, we claim that h satisfies the intermediate value property on [0,1].\nLet c and d be points in [0,1] with c < d and h(c) (cid:54)= h(d). If c is positive, the desired\nresult follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem, along with the observation that\nh: [0,1] \u2192 R is continuous on (0,1]. The only case to consider separately is when\nc = 0.\nTake c = 0 and suppose that h(c) < L < h(d). Note that h(c) = 0 and h(d) \u2264 1,\nso 0 < L < 1. Choose a natural number m so that 0 < (L+1)/3m < d. Observe that\n1 L+1 2\n< < ,\n3m 3m 3m\nso it follows from the definition of h that\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nL+1 L+1\nh = 3m \u00b7 \u22121 = L.\n3m 3m 98\nIn other words, the function h: [0,1] \u2192 R satisfies the intermediate value property\non [0,1].\nThere are many other functions that are not continuous on [a,b] but which still\nsatisfy the intermediate value property (see Exercises 2.29 and 2.30). While these ex-\namples vary considerably, they all demonstrate some sort of wild oscillation. Proposi-\ntion 2.24 will make this observation more precise. Before stating that result, we need\nto provide a few additional definitions.\nDefinition 2.22 A function f: I \u2192 R is called non-decreasing if f(s) \u2264 f(t) for all\ns and t in I with s < t. Similarly, f: I \u2192 R is called non-increasing if f(s) \u2265 f(t) for\nall s and t in I with s < t. A function that is either non-decreasing or non-increasing\nis called monotonic.\nDefinition 2.23 A function f: I \u2192 R is called increasing if f(s) < f(t) for all s\nand t in I with s < t. Similarly, f: I \u2192 R is called decreasing if f(s) > f(t) for all\ns and t in I with s < t.\nSome authors employ the terms increasing and decreasing to mean non-decreasing\nand non-increasing, in which case one would use strictly increasing and strictly de-\ncreasing to indicate the properties described in Definition 2.23.\nProposition 2.24 Any monotonic function f: [a,b] \u2192 R that satisfies the interme-\ndiate value property on [a,b] must be continuous on [a,b].\nProof. Consider the case where f is non-decreasing. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive\nnumber. We will construct a gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b] by initially defining a pair of gauges\n\u03b4 (t) and \u03b4 (t). First of all, consider a point t in (a,b]. It is possible that f(t) \u2212\n1 2 99\n\u03b5/2 \u2264 f(a), in which case we take \u03b4 (t) = t \u2212 a. If f(a) < f(t) \u2212 \u03b5/2 < f(t), the\n1\nintermediate value property guarantees there is a point x , with a < x < t, such that\nt t\nf(x ) = f(t)\u2212\u03b5/2. In that case, take \u03b4 (t) = t\u2212x . In either situation, the fact that\nt 1 t\nf is non-decreasing guarantees that f(t)\u2212\u03b5/2 \u2264 f(s) whenever t\u2212\u03b4 (t) < s \u2264 b.\n1\nNow consider t in [a,b). It is possible that f(b) \u2264 f(t)+\u03b5/2, in which case we take\n\u03b4 (t) = b\u2212t. If f(t) < f(t)+\u03b5/2 < f(b), the intermediate value property guarantees\n2\nthere is a point y , with t < y < b, such that f(y ) = f(t)+\u03b5/2. In that case, take\nt t t\n\u03b4 (t) = y \u2212t. The fact that f is non-decreasing guarantees that f(s) \u2264 f(t)+\u03b5/2\n2 t\nwhenever a \u2264 s < t+\u03b4 (t).\n2\nDefine the gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b] as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\u03b4 (a), t = a\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b4(t) = .\nmin{\u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t)}, a < t < b\n1 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3\u03b4 (b), t = b\n1\nBased on our work above, we see that\n\u03b5 \u03b5\nf(t)\u2212\u03b5 < f(t)\u2212 \u2264 f(s) \u2264 f(t)+ < f(t)+\u03b5\n2 2\nwhenever t \u2212 \u03b4(t) < s < t + \u03b4(t). In other words, |f(s) \u2212 f(t)| < \u03b5 whenever\n|s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), so f is continuous on [a,b].\nWe may apply a similar argument when f is non-increasing, or simply note that\nthe function \u2212f is non-decreasing and hence continuous.\nCombined with the Pasting Lemma, this result shows that any function which\nsatisfies the intermediate value property on [a,b] and which \u201cchanges direction\u201d (i.e.,\ngoes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa) a finite number of times over the 100\ninterval must be continuous on [a,b]. In other words, a discontinuous function that\nsatisfies the intermediate value property on [a,b] must \u201cchange direction\u201d infinitely\nmany times over the interval, as in the case of Example 2.21.\nAs we will observe in the next chapter, the intermediate value property is inextri-\ncably associated with derivatives.\nHistorical Notes\n(1) Although there had been precursors throughout the 18th century, the modern\nformulation of continuity began to emerge in the early 19th century. As in the\ncase of suprema and Cauchy sequences, Bolzano\u2019s 1817 treatise represented the\nfirst substantial progress towards a rigorous definition:\nAccording to a correct definition, the expression that a function fx\nvaries according to the law of continuity for all values of x inside\nor outside certain limits means only that, if x is any such value, the\ndifference f(x+\u03c9)\u2212fx can be made smaller than any given quantity,\nprovided \u03c9 can be taken as small as we please.\nOnce again, this perspective was popularized and refined by other mathemati-\ncians, particularly Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass (1815\u20131897).\n(2) The special case of the Intermediate Value Theorem for L = 0 is sometimes\ncalled Bolzano\u2019s Theorem. In fact, the (rather lengthy) title of the aforemen-\ntioned treatise from 1817 may be translated as Purely Analytic Proof of the\nTheorem that between any two Values, which give Results of Opposite Sign, 101\nthere lies at least one real Root of the Equation. Bolzano actually stated a more\ngeneral result:\nIf two functions of x, fx and \u03d5x, vary according to the law of conti-\nnuity either for all values of x or for all those lying between \u03b1 and\n\u03b2, and furthermore if f\u03b1 < \u03d5\u03b1 and f\u03b2 > \u03d5\u03b2, then there is always a\ncertain value of x between \u03b1 and \u03b2 for which fx = \u03d5x.\nThis theorem (and its application to polynomials) was Bolzano\u2019s primary mo-\ntivation for developing what we now consider to be many of the fundamental\nconcepts in analysis.\n(3) The property of uniform continuity took longer to develop. Although the con-\ncept was foreshadowed by other mathematicians, the formal definition did not\nappear in print until 1870 (in a paper by Eduard Heine). Likewise, while\nBolzano and Dirichlet were both aware of the result of Theorem 2.16, the proof\nwas first published in 1872 (also in a paper by Heine). See [19] and [49] for\nmore details.\n(4) The criterion introduced in Exercise 2.23, which could be called the Sequential\nCharacterization of Uniform Continuity, was stated by David Burton and John\nColeman in 2010.\n(5) The Extreme Value Theorem was known to Bolzano in the 1830s, although the\nrelevant manuscript was not published until 1930. The result first appeared in\n1870, in a paper by Georg Cantor, where it was attributed to the lectures of his\nadvisor Weierstrass (who had rediscovered the result around 1860). 102\nExercises\n*Exercise 2.1 Consider the function f: [0,2] \u2192 R defined as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f43, 0 \u2264 t < 1\n\uf8f2\nf(t) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f37, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 2\nShow that the function f: [1,2] \u2192 R is continuous on [1,2], while the function\nf: [0,2] \u2192 R is not continuous on [1,2].\n*Exercise 2.2 Recall the concepts of continuity and uniform continuity, as stated\nin Definitions 2.2 and 2.3.\na.

The following definitions incorporate these concepts\ninto the framework we have already established.\nDefinition 3.1 A function f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on a subset A of I if there\nexists a function g: A \u2192 R such that, for every positive number \u03b5, there is a gauge\n\u03b4(t) on A for which\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g(t)(cid:12) < \u03b5 (3.1)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) 109\nwhenever s belongs to I, the point t belongs to A, and 0 < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4(t). In this\nsituation, the function g is known as a derivative of f.\nDefinition 3.2 A function f: I \u2192 R that is differentiable on A \u2286 I is called\nuniformly differentiable on A if, for every positive number \u03b5, the corresponding gauge\n\u03b4(t) can be taken to be a constant function.\nNote the stipulation that 0 < |s \u2212 t|, which is not present in the definitions of\ncontinuity and uniform continuity. This condition simply guarantees that s (cid:54)= t, so\nthe quotient in (3.1) is not undefined.\nAs in Chapter 2, we observe that f is differentiable on A \u2286 I if and only if f\nis differentiable on the singleton set {t} for each t in A. We say that f: I \u2192 R is\ndifferentiable at a point t in I if f is differentiable on {t}. If f is not differentiable\non {t}, we say that f is non-differentiable at t. We define the set of differentiability\nD to consist of all points in I at which f is differentiable. As before, D can be\nf f\ndescribed as the largest subset A of I that satisfies Definition 3.1.\nAs in the case of continuity, we may occasionally need to consider a function\ndefined on the union of finitely many pairwise disjoint intervals I ,I ,...,I . In that\n1 2 n\nsituation, for a subset A of the domain, we will consider the differentiability of f\nseparately on each nonempty set A\u2229I ,A\u2229I ,...,A\u2229I .\n1 2 n\nWe begin with a fundamental observation.\nProposition 3.3 If f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on A \u2286 I, the function f has a unique\nderivative on A.\nProof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that f has two derivatives g : A \u2192 R\n1\nand g : A \u2192 R. Let x be a point in A at which g and g differ and consider the\n2 1 2 110\npositive number \u03b5 = |g (x)\u2212g (x)|/2. By assumption, there must be a gauge \u03b4 (t)\n1 2 1\non A such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g (t)(cid:12) < \u03b5\n1\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t). Likewise, there is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on A such that\n1 2\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g (t)(cid:12) < \u03b5\n2\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nwhenever 0 < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4 (t). Define \u03b4(t) = min{\u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t)}. Taking s such that\n2 1 2\n0 < |s\u2212x| < \u03b4(x), we see that\n(cid:12)(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) f(s)\u2212f(x) f(s)\u2212f(x) (cid:12)\n|g (x)\u2212g (x)| = (cid:12) g (x)\u2212 + \u2212g (x) (cid:12)\n1 2 1 2\n(cid:12) s\u2212x s\u2212x (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(x) (cid:12) (cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(x) (cid:12)\n\u2264 (cid:12) \u2212g (x)(cid:12)+(cid:12) \u2212g (x)(cid:12)\n1 2\n(cid:12) s\u2212x (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212x (cid:12)\n< \u03b5+\u03b5 = |g (x)\u2212g (x)|,\n1 2\nwhich is a contradiction. Hence we conclude that g and g must be identical.\n1 2\nIn light of this result, we will use the standard notation f(cid:48) or df(t) to denote the\ndt\n(unique) derivative of f on A. Although we will not typically use Definition 3.1 to\nevaluate the derivative directly, we will consider a few illustrative examples.\nExample 3.4 For an interval I, consider the functions f: I \u2192 R and g: I \u2192 R\ngiven by the rules f(t) = \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a constant, and g(t) = t. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary\npositive number. Observe that\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)\u03b1\u2212\u03b1 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u22120(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u22120(cid:12) = 0 < \u03b5\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nand\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u22121(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u22121(cid:12) = 0 < \u03b5\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12)s\u2212t (cid:12) 111\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), regardless of the gauge \u03b4(t). Consequently f is differen-\ntiable on I, with f(cid:48)(t) = 0, and g is differentiable on I, with g(cid:48)(t) = 1. The gauge\n\u03b4(t) may be taken to be constant in both instances, so f and g are both uniformly\ndifferentiable on I.\nExample 3.5 For an interval I, consider the function h: I \u2192 R given by the rule\nh(t) = t2. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and take \u03b4 = \u03b5. Observe that\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)h(s)\u2212h(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)s2 \u2212t2 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u22122t(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u22122t(cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(s\u2212t)(s+t) (cid:12)\n= (cid:12) \u22122t(cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n= (cid:12)(s+t)\u22122t(cid:12)\n= |s\u2212t| < \u03b5\nwhenever 0 < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4. Since the gauge \u03b4 is constant on I, the function h is\nuniformly differentiable on I.\nExample 3.6 Consider the function f: R \u2192 R given by the rule f(t) = t3. For an\narbitrary positive number \u03b5, define the gauge\n(cid:26) (cid:27)\n\u03b5\n\u03b4(t) = min ,1 .\n3|t|+1 112\nIf |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), it follows that |s\u2212t| < 1 and |s| < |t|+1. Consequently\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)s3 \u2212t3 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u22123t2 (cid:12) = (cid:12) \u22123t2 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(s\u2212t)(s2 +st+t2)\n(cid:12)\n= (cid:12) \u22123t2 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n= (cid:12)(s2 +st+t2)\u22123t2 (cid:12)\n= |s2 +st\u22122t2|\n= |s\u2212t||s+2t|\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n\u2264 |s\u2212t| |s|+|2t|\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n< \u03b4(t)\u00b7 (|t|+1)+2|t|\n\u03b5\n\u2264 \u00b7(3|t|+1) = \u03b5\n3|t|+1\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Therefore f is differentiable on R, with f(cid:48)(t) = 3t2. Our\nchoice of \u03b4(t) suggests that f may not be uniformly differentiable on R, a fact that\nwill become apparent once we have proved Proposition 3.10.\nExample 3.7 Consider the function i: (0,\u221e) \u2192 R defined by the rule i(t) = 1/t.\nFor an arbitrary positive number \u03b5, define the gauge\n(cid:26) t3\u03b5 t(cid:27)\n\u03b4(t) = min , .\n2 2 113\nIf |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), then |s\u2212t| < t/2 and hence s > t/2. Consequently\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)i(s)\u2212i(t) 1(cid:12) (cid:12)1/s\u22121/t 1(cid:12)\n(cid:12) + (cid:12) = (cid:12) + (cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t t2(cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t t2(cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(t2 \u2212st)+(s2 \u2212st)(cid:12)\n= (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (s\u2212t)st2 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(s\u2212t)2\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n= (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(s\u2212t)st2(cid:12)\n|s\u2212t|\n=\nst2\n2|s\u2212t|\n<\nt3\n2\u03b4(t)\n<\nt3\n2 t3\u03b5\n\u2264 \u00b7 = \u03b5\nt3 2\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Therefore i is differentiable on (0,\u221e), with i(cid:48)(t) = \u22121/t2.\nAs in the preceding example, Proposition 3.10 will show that i is not uniformly\ndifferentiable on (0,\u221e).\nOur final example of this section is differentiable on a proper subset of its domain.\nExample 3.8 Consider the function g: R \u2192 R defined by the rule g(t) = |t|. We\nclaim that the set D is precisely R\\{0}. To show that g is differentiable on R\\{0},\ng\nlet \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and consider the gauge \u03b4(t) = |t| on R\\{0}. If\n|s\u2212t| < |t|, then s and t must have the same sign. In other words, if 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t),\nthen\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)\u2212s+t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) +1(cid:12) = (cid:12) +1(cid:12) = 0 < \u03b5\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nwhenever s and t are both negative and\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u22121(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u22121(cid:12) = 0 < \u03b5\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12)s\u2212t (cid:12) 114\nwhenever s and t are both positive. Consequently g is differentiable on R\\{0}, with\ng(cid:48): R\\{0} \u2192 R given by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\u22121, t < 0\n\uf8f2\ng(cid:48)(t) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f31, t > 0\nTo see that g is not differentiable on the set {0}, suppose that g(cid:48)(0) does exist. By\nassumption, there is a gauge \u03b4 on {0} such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(0) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(0)(cid:12) < 1\n(cid:12) s\u22120 (cid:12)\nwhenever 0 < |s\u22120| < \u03b4. If \u2212\u03b4 < s < 0, then\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(0) (cid:12) (cid:12)\u2212s\u22120 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(0)(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(0)(cid:12) = |\u22121\u2212g(cid:48)(0)| = |1+g(cid:48)(0)|. (3.2)\n(cid:12) s\u22120 (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u22120 (cid:12)\nIf 0 < s < \u03b4, then\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(0) (cid:12) (cid:12)s\u22120 (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(0)(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(0)(cid:12) = |1\u2212g(cid:48)(0)|. (3.3)\n(cid:12) s\u22120 (cid:12) (cid:12)s\u22120 (cid:12)\nMoreover, both (3.2) and (3.3) must be less than 1. Consequently\n(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:12)\n2 = (cid:12) 1+g(0) + 1\u2212g(0) (cid:12) \u2264 |1+g(0)|+|1\u2212g(0)| < 1+1 = 2,\nwhich is a contradiction. Therefore g is not differentiable on {0}, so D = R\\{0}.\ng\nFor the sake of contrast, it is easy to demonstrate (for example, by appealing to\nExample 2.5 and Exercise 2.9) that C = R.\ng\nOne of the major issues we will be considering in this chapter is the relationship\nbetween continuity and differentiability. The first result along these lines is fairly\nstraightforward. 115\nProposition 3.9 If f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on A \u2286 I, then f is also continuous\non A.\nProof. Since f is differentiable on A, there is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on A such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) < 1\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t), from which it follows that\n1\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| < |f(cid:48)(t)|+1 |s\u2212t|.\nLet \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and define the gauge\n(cid:26) (cid:27)\n\u03b5\n\u03b4(t) = min \u03b4 (t), .\n1 |f(cid:48)(t)|+1\nIf 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t), then\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| < |f(cid:48)(t)|+1 |s\u2212t|\n\u03b5\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n< |f(cid:48)(t)|+1 \u00b7 = \u03b5.\n|f(cid:48)(t)|+1\nThe same inequality holds trivially when |s\u2212t| = 0, so we conclude that f is contin-\nuous on A.\nIn other words, D \u2286 C . Example 3.8 demonstrates that this inclusion may be\nf f\nproper.\nProposition 3.9 dictates that every differentiable function f must be continuous.\nA more delicate question is whether the resulting derivative f(cid:48) must be continuous.\nWhile we will devote a large portion of the chapter to investigating this question, we\ncan state a partial result immediately. 116\nProposition 3.10 If f: I \u2192 R is uniformly differentiable on I, the derivative f(cid:48) is\nuniformly continuous on I.\nProof. Suppose f is uniformly differentiable on I and let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive\nnumber. By assumption, there is a constant gauge \u03b4 such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) < (3.4)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) 2\nwhenever 0 < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4. Because of the uniformity condition, (3.4) holds if we\ninterchange the roles of s and t. Thus\n(cid:12)(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) f(s)\u2212f(t) f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n|f(cid:48)(s)\u2212f(cid:48)(t)| = (cid:12) f(cid:48)(s)\u2212 + \u2212f(cid:48)(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(t)\u2212f(s) (cid:12) (cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n\u2264 (cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(s)(cid:12)+(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) t\u2212s (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + +\u03b5\n2 2\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. (The same inequality holds trivially when |s\u2212t| = 0.) In\nother words, f(cid:48) is uniformly continuous on I.\nIn particular, earlier results relating to uniform continuity show that the functions\ndefined in Examples 3.6 and 3.7 are not uniformly differentiable on their respective\ndomains. In Section 3.4, we will demonstrate that the converse of Proposition 3.10\nholds as well. The situation can be more complicated when f is not uniformly differ-\nentiable, as we shall see in Section 3.3.\n3.2 Properties of the Derivative\nAt this point, it will be helpful to establish many of the (presumably familiar)\nshortcuts for determining the derivative of a function. We begin with a straightfor-\nward pair of observations. 117\nProposition 3.11 (Linearity of the Derivative) If f: I \u2192 R and g: I \u2192 R are both\ndifferentiable on A \u2286 I, then:\n(1) The function f +g is differentiable on A, with (f +g)(cid:48) = f(cid:48)+g(cid:48). If f and g are\nboth uniformly differentiable on A, then so is f +g.\n(2) The function \u03b1f is differentiable on A for any constant \u03b1, with (\u03b1f)(cid:48) = \u03b1f(cid:48). If\nf is uniformly differentiable on A, then so is \u03b1f.\nProof. (1) Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since f is differentiable on A, there\nis a gauge \u03b4 (t) on A such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) <\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) 2\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t). Likewise, there is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on A such that\n1 2\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) <\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) 2\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 (t). Define the gauge \u03b4(t) = min{\u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t)}. Observe that\n2 1 2\n(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) f(s)+g(s) \u2212 f(t)+g(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n(cid:12) \u2212 f(cid:48)(t)+g(cid:48)(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) f(s)\u2212f(t) g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12)\n= (cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t) + \u2212g(cid:48)(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t s\u2212t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12)\n\u2264 (cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12)+(cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(t)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5\n2 2\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Thus f +g is differentiable on A, with (f +g)(cid:48) = f(cid:48)+g(cid:48).\nIf both of the gauges \u03b4 (t) and \u03b4 (t) are constant on A, then so is the gauge\n1 2\n\u03b4(t) = min{\u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t)}. Therefore f + g is uniformly differentiable on A whenever\n1 2\nboth f and g are uniformly differentiable. 118\n(2) Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since f is differentiable on A, there is\na gauge \u03b4(t) on A such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) <\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) |\u03b1|+1\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Hence\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)\u03b1f(s)\u2212\u03b1f(t) (cid:12) (cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212\u03b1f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) = |\u03b1|(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) (cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\n\u03b5\n\u2264 |\u03b1|\u00b7 < \u03b5\n|\u03b1|+1\nwhenever0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4(t). Therefore\u03b1f isdifferentiableonA, with (\u03b1f)(cid:48) = \u03b1f(cid:48).\nIf f is uniformly differentiable on A, then the gauge \u03b4(t) may be taken to be\nconstant, which means that \u03b1f is uniformly differentiable on A.\nAs the reader is probably aware, the situation is somewhat more complicated for\nproducts.\nProposition 3.12 (ProductRule) Iff: I \u2192 Randg: I \u2192 Rarebothdifferentiable\non A \u2286 I, the function fg is differentiable on A, with (fg)(cid:48) = fg(cid:48) +gf(cid:48).\nProof. We will show that fg is differentiable on a singleton set A = {t}, with the\nappropriate derivative, from which the result will follow for an arbitrary set A.\nLet \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and define\n\u03b5\n\u03b5 = .\nt |f(t)|+|g(t)|+|g(cid:48)(t)|+1\nSince f and g are both differentiable on A = {t}, there is a gauge \u03b4 on {t} such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) < \u03b5\nt\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) 119\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 and a gauge \u03b4 on {t} such that\n1 2\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)g(s)\u2212g(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212g(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) < \u03b5\nt\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nwhenever 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4 .

Therefore the product fg is differentiable on A = {t}, with\n(fg)(cid:48) = fg(cid:48) +gf(cid:48). 120\nBecause the proof is constructed relative to {t}, this argument does not provide\nany insight as to whether fg might be uniformly differentiable on a larger set. The\nanswer to that question depends at least partially on the properties of the interval I\n(see Exercises 3.16 and 3.17).\nOnce we have established the product rule, it is easy to verify one of the more\nrecognizable results from calculus.\nCorollary 3.13 (Power Rule) For any non-negative integer n, the function f: R \u2192\nR given by the rule f(t) = tn is differentiable on R, with f(cid:48)(t) = ntn\u22121.\nBefore proving this result, we should clarify that the expressions t0 and 0\u00b7t\u22121 should\nbe interpreted as the constant functions 1 and 0 respectively, even when t = 0.\nProof. We will prove this assertion using mathematical induction. Example 3.4 shows\nthat the claim holds for n = 0 and n = 1. Now suppose the claim holds for a natural\nnumber n. The product rule dictates that f(t) = tn+1 = t\u00b7tn is differentiable, with\nd d\nf(cid:48)(t) = t\u00b7 tn +tn \u00b7 t\ndt dt\n= t\u00b7ntn\u22121 +tn \u00b71\n= ntn +tn = (n+1)tn.\nThus the claim also holds for the natural number n + 1, so the formula is valid for\nevery natural number n.\nWith a bit of work, this result can be extended to a function given by the rule\ng(t) = tr for any rational exponent r (see Exercise 3.2).\nWe still need to verify one other familiar rule of differentiation, whose proof turns\nout to be somewhat more delicate. 121\nProposition 3.14 (Chain Rule) Consider a pair of functions f: I \u2192 I and\n1 2\ng: I \u2192 R, so that the composition g \u25e6 f: I \u2192 R is defined.

Once again, we will demonstrate this assertion in the context of a singleton\nset A = {t}, which will yield the desired result for an arbitrary set.\nDefine the function f : I \u2192 R as follows:\ne 1\n\uf8f1\nf(s)\u2212f(t)\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 \u2212f(cid:48)(t), s (cid:54)= t\n\uf8f2\ns\u2212t\nf (s) = .\ne\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, s = t\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nObserve that f (s) + f(cid:48)(t) (s \u2212 t) = f(s) \u2212 f(t) for all s in I , even when s = t.\ne 1\nLikewise, define g : I \u2192 R by the rule\ne 2\n\uf8f1\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4g(u)\u2212g f(t) \u2212g(cid:48)(cid:0) f(t)(cid:1) , u (cid:54)= f(t)\n\uf8f2\nu\u2212f(t)\ng (u) = ,\ne\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f40, u = f(t)\n\uf8f3\n(cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nso that g (u)+g(cid:48) f(t) u\u2212f(t) = g(u)\u2212g f(t) .

The\npurpose of this section is to demonstrate that it is, in fact, possible for a function to\nbe differentiable on an interval but for its derivative not to be continuous. The fol-\nlowing example relies entirely on results we have already proved, with one exception.\nWe will need to appeal to the fact that a differentiable function is non-decreasing on a\nparticular interval whenever its derivative on that interval is non-negative (Corollary\n3.20). While we will establish that result in the next section, it is helpful to introduce\nthis example before proceeding further.\nFor every natural number k, consider the function g : [1/3k,1/3k\u22121] \u2192 R defined\nk\nby the rule\n4 5\n(cid:0) 3kt\u22122(cid:1)3k\ng (t) = + , (3.6)\nk 9k 9k\nso that\n4(cid:0) 3kt\u22122(cid:1)3k\u22121\ng(cid:48)(t) = .\nk\nObserve that\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1\ng = = g\nk+1 3k 9k k 3k\nand\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1\ng(cid:48) = 4 = g(cid:48)\nk+1 3k k 3k\nfor all k. Now define the function g: [0,1] \u2192 R as follows:\n\uf8f1\n4 5\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 (cid:0) 3kt\u22122(cid:1)3k + , 1/3k < t \u2264 1/3k\u22121\n\uf8f2\n9k 9k\ng(t) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, t = 0 125\nfor all k in N.

Therefore (0,1] \u2286 D (see Exercise 3.4), with\ng\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1\ng = , g(cid:48) = 4, (3.7)\n3k 9k 3k\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n2 5 2\ng = , g(cid:48) = 0, (3.8)\n3k 9k 3k\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1\ng = , g(cid:48) = 4 (3.9)\n3k\u22121 9k\u22121 3k\u22121\nfor all k in N.\nWe will now consider the question of differentiability at the point 0. For a partic-\nular s in (0,1], let k be the natural number such that 1/3k < s \u2264 1/3k\u22121. Since the\nderivative g(cid:48) is non-negative on [1/3k,1/3k\u22121], we know that 1/9k \u2264 g(s) \u2264 1/9k\u22121\n(see Corollary 3.20 below).

Thefunctiong didnotspringex nihilo fromanyone\u2019smind, butwasreverse-\nengineered to satisfy conditions (3.7) to (3.9). The main idea is that g coincides with\nthe function f(t) = t2 at each point 1/3k\u22121, while having a fixed positive value for\nthe derivative at every such point. In this regard, it is necessary for the exponent\nof 3kt \u2212 2 in (3.6) to be odd, which is one reason it is helpful to work on intervals\nbounded by multiples of 1/3. The outline of this construction, albeit in a rather\ndifferent form, appears in a short paper by Peterson [44]. This particular example\nwas introduced in [31].\nThe reader should note that the derivative g(cid:48), while not continuous on [0,1], still 127\n4\n1 1 2 1 2\n1\n27 9 9 3 3\nFigure 3.2: The function g(cid:48).\nsatisfies the intermediate value property on that interval (see Exercise 2.29). As it\nturns out, this situation is not a coincidental feature of this one example, but an\ninherent attribute of all derivatives. The corresponding result (Theorem 3.25) will be\none of the major accomplishments of this chapter.\n3.4 Mean and Intermediate Values\nWe begin this section with a moderately technical observation.\nProposition 3.16 Suppose f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on A \u2286 I.\n(1) Suppose f attains a minimum on I at a point x in A. If x is not a left endpoint 128\nfor I, then f(cid:48)(x) \u2264 0.\n(2) Supposef attainsaminimumonI atapointxinA. Ifxisnota right endpoint\nfor I, then f(cid:48)(x) \u2265 0.\n(3) Suppose f attains a maximum on I at a point x in A. If x is not a left endpoint\nfor I, then f(cid:48)(x) \u2265 0.\n(4) Suppose f attains a maximum on I at a point x in A. If x is not a right\nendpoint for I, then f(cid:48)(x) \u2264 0.\nProof. (1) Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that f(cid:48)(x) > 0. For the positive\nnumber \u03b5 = f(cid:48)(x), there must be a gauge \u03b4(t) on A such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) < \u03b5,\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nor equivalently\nf(s)\u2212f(t) f(s)\u2212f(t)\n\u2212f(cid:48)(x) < f(cid:48)(t) < +f(cid:48)(x), (3.10)\ns\u2212t s\u2212t\nwhenever 0 < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4(t). Since x is not a left endpoint for I, there must be a\npoint s in I with\n1\nx\u2212\u03b4(x) < s < x.\n1\nSince f(x) is the minimum value for f on I, we know that f(s )\u2212f(x) \u2265 0. Conse-\n1\nquently\nf(s )\u2212f(x)\n1\n\u2264 0.\ns \u2212x\n1\nSubstituting x and s into (3.10), we see that\n1\nf(s )\u2212f(x)\nf(cid:48)(x) < 1 +f(cid:48)(x) \u2264 f(cid:48)(x),\ns \u2212x\n1 129\nwhich is impossible. Hence we conclude that f(cid:48)(x) \u2264 0.\n(2) We could obtain this case by a similar argument, taking \u03b5 = \u2212f(cid:48)(x). Alter-\nnatively, let \u2212I = {t \u2208 R : \u2212t \u2208 I} and consider the function g: \u2212 I \u2192 R given\nby the rule g(t) = f(\u2212t). The chain rule dictates that g is differentiable on the set\n\u2212A = {t \u2208 R : \u2212t \u2208 A}, with g(cid:48)(\u2212t) = \u2212f(cid:48)(\u2212t). If f attains a minimum at a point\nx that is not a right endpoint for I, then g attains a minimum at \u2212x, which is not a\nleft endpoint for \u2212I. Consequently g(cid:48)(\u2212x) \u2264 0, which means that f(cid:48)(x) \u2265 0.\nCases (3) and (4) may be handled in a similar fashion, or we could simply note\nthat the function \u2212f attains a minimum at x.\nThis result immediately gives rise to another familiar tool from calculus.\nTheorem 3.17 (Fermat\u2019s Theorem) Suppose f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on A \u2286 I\nand that f attains either a minimum or maximum on I at a point x in A. If x is not\nan endpoint for I, then f(cid:48)(x) = 0.\nProof. If x is neither a left endpoint nor a right endpoint for I, Proposition 3.16\ndictates that f(cid:48)(x) \u2264 0 and f(cid:48)(x) \u2265 0.\nWhile this result is frequently used to solve concrete problems, we will view it\nprimarily as a mechanism for proving both the Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 3.19)\nand Darboux\u2019s Theorem (Theorem 3.25). Our next result, while a named theorem\nfor historical reasons, should be viewed as a special case of the Mean Value Theorem.\nTheorem 3.18 (Rolle\u2019s Theorem) Suppose g: [a,b] \u2192 R is continuous on [a,b], with\n(a,b) \u2286 D . If g(a) = g(b), there is at least one point c in (a,b) with g(cid:48)(c) = 0.\ng\nProof. The Extreme Value Theorem dictates that g attains both a minimum and\nmaximum on [a,b]. If both the minimum and maximum are attained at the endpoints 130\na and b, then the fact that g(a) = g(b) guarantees that g is constant on [a,b]. In\nthat case, Example 3.4 shows that g(cid:48)(t) = 0 for all t in [a,b]. On the other hand,\nif g attains either a minimum or maximum at a point c in (a,b), Fermat\u2019s Theorem\nshows that g(cid:48)(c) = 0.\nThe proof above is surprisingly simple. What is more remarkable is that it con-\nstitutes the crux of the proof for the Mean Value Theorem, one of the fundamental\nfacts pertaining to derivatives (see also Exercises 3.23 to 3.25).\nTheorem 3.19 (Mean Value Theorem) Suppose f: [a,b] \u2192 R is continuous on [a,b],\nwith (a,b) \u2286 D . There is at least one point c in (a,b) with\nf\nf(b)\u2212f(a)\nf(cid:48)(c) = .\nb\u2212a\nProof. Define the function g: [a,b] \u2192 R by the following rule:\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nf(b)\u2212f(a)\ng(t) = f(t)\u2212 (t\u2212a).\nb\u2212a\nObserve that g(a) = f(a) and g(b) = f(a). Hence we may apply Rolle\u2019s Theorem,\nalong with Propositions 2.9 and 3.11, to see that there is a point c in (a,b) with\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nf(b)\u2212f(a)\n0 = g(cid:48)(c) = f(cid:48)(c)\u2212 ,\nb\u2212a\nwhich is exactly what we had hoped to show.\nAsweshallsee, theMeanValueTheoremisoneoftheprimaryvehiclesforrelating\na function to its derivative. In many cases, it allows us to verify some of the intuitive\nnotions we may have acquired through studying calculus.\nCorollary 3.20 If f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on I, with f(cid:48)(t) \u2265 0 for all t in I, then\nf is non-decreasing on I. Likewise, if f(cid:48)(t) \u2264 0 for all t in I, then f is non-increasing\non I. 131\nProof. Suppose f is differentiable on I and let s and t be any pair of points in I with\ns < t. Since f is continuous on [s,t] \u2282 I, the Mean Value Theorem dictates that\nthere is a point c in (s,t) with\nf(s)\u2212f(t)\nf(cid:48)(c) = .\ns\u2212t\nIf f(cid:48)(t) \u2265 0 for all t in I, so that f(cid:48)(c) is guaranteed to be non-negative, then\nf(s) \u2264 f(t) and hence f is non-decreasing on I. Similarly, if f(cid:48)(t) \u2264 0 for all t in I,\nwe conclude that f(s) \u2265 f(t) and hence f is non-increasing on I.\nCorollary 3.21 If f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on I, with f(cid:48)(t) = 0 for all t in I, then\nf is constant on I.\nProof. If f(cid:48)(t) = 0 for all t in I, it follows from Corollary 3.20 that f is both non-\ndecreasing and non-increasing on I. Consequently f must be constant on I.\nCorollary 3.22 If f: I \u2192 R and g: I \u2192 R are both differentiable on I, with\nf(cid:48)(t) = g(cid:48)(t) for all t \u2208 I, there is a constant C such that f(t) = g(t) + C for all t\nin I.\nProof. If f(cid:48)(t) = g(cid:48)(t) for all t in I, then the function f \u2212 g has derivative 0 on I.\nHence Corollary 3.21 dictates that f \u2212g is constant on I.\nThe Mean Value Theorem also allows us to demonstrate the converse of Proposi-\ntion 3.10.\nTheorem 3.23 Suppose f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on I. The derivative f(cid:48) is\nuniformly continuous on I if and only if f is uniformly differentiable on I.\nProof. We already know that any uniformly differentiable function on I must have a\nuniformly continuous derivative on I. Suppose then that f(cid:48) is uniformly continuous 132\non I. In other words, for any positive number \u03b5, there is a constant gauge \u03b4 on I\nsuch that |f(cid:48)(s)\u2212f(cid:48)(t)| < \u03b5 whenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. If 0 < |s\u2212t| < \u03b4, the Mean Value\nTheorem guarantees there is a c between s and t such that\nf(s)\u2212f(t)\n= f(cid:48)(c).\ns\u2212t\nTherefore\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)f(s)\u2212f(t) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) \u2212f(cid:48)(t)(cid:12) = |f(cid:48)(c)\u2212f(cid:48)(t)|,\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12)\nwhich is less than \u03b5 because |c \u2212 t| < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4. In other words, f is uniformly\ndifferentiable on I.\nBefore proceeding to the final result of the chapter, we will take a moment to\ndisabuse ourselves of a common misconception.\nExample 3.24 Consider the function f: [0,1] \u2192 R defined by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4(4k2 \u22121)(cid:0) (2k +1)t\u22121(cid:1)2(cid:0) (2k \u22121)t\u22121(cid:1)2 , 1/(2k +1) < t \u2264 1/(2k \u22121)\n\uf8f2\nf(t) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, t = 0\nfor all k in N. An argument similar to that employed in Section 3.3 shows that f is\ndifferentiable on [0,1], with f(cid:48)(0) = 0. (The reader is asked to verify this assertion\nas Exercise 3.9.) Define the function g: [0,1] \u2192 R by setting g(t) = f(t)+t/2. Note\nthat g(cid:48)(0) = 1/2, yet\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1\ng = 0+ = ,\n2k +1 2(2k +1) 2(2k +1)\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n2k 1 k k +1\ng = + = ,\n4k2 \u22121 4k2 \u22121 4k2 \u22121 4k2 \u22121\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1\ng = 0+ =\n2k \u22121 2(2k \u22121) 2(2k \u22121) 133\nfor all k in N. In particular,\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 2k 1 k +1 1\ng \u2212g = \u2212 = \u2212 < 0.\n2k \u22121 4k2 \u22121 2(2k \u22121) 4k2 \u22121 2(4k2 \u22121)\nIn other words, g fails to be non-decreasing on any interval [0,s] for 0 < s \u2264 1, even\nthough g(cid:48)(0) > 0. The lesson here is that there is no alternate version of Corollary\n3.20 for which the sign of the derivative at a single point dictates the behavior of the\nfunction over an entire interval.\n2\n3\n1\n2\n1\n6\n1\n10\n1 1 1 4 1 2\n1\n9 7 5 15 3 3\nFigure 3.3: The function g from Example 3.24.\nAs a side note, we should mention that g(cid:48): [0,1] \u2192 R cannot be continuous on\n[0,1]. For every natural number k, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees there is a\npoint c between 2k/(4k2 \u22121) and 1/(2k \u22121) with\nk\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 2k 1\ng \u2212g \u2212\n2k \u22121 4k2 \u22121 2(4k2 \u22121) 1\ng(cid:48)(c ) = = = \u2212 .\nk 1 2k 1 2\n\u2212\n2k \u22121 4k2 \u22121 4k2 \u22121 134\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nObservethatthesequence(c )convergesto0, while g(cid:48)(c ) convergesto\u22121/2. Since\nk k\ng(cid:48)(0) = 1/2, Proposition 2.13 shows that 0 does not belong to C .\ng(cid:48)\nWe conclude this chapter with a fundamental observation about derivatives. Even\nthough they need not be continuous, they must still satisfy the intermediate value\nproperty.\nTheorem 3.25 (Darboux\u2019s Theorem) Suppose f: I \u2192 R is differentiable on I. Let\nc and d be points in I, with c < d. If either f(cid:48)(c) < L < f(cid:48)(d) or f(cid:48)(c) > L > f(cid:48)(d),\nthen there is a point x in the interval (c,d) with f(cid:48)(x) = L.\nProof. The proof is similar in spirit to that of the Mean Value Theorem. We will\nbegin with the special case where g: I \u2192 R is a differentiable function with g(cid:48)(c) <\n0 < g(cid:48)(d). Since g is continuous on the compact interval [c,d], the Extreme Value\nTheoremdictatesthatg mustattainaminimumon[c,d]. Case(2)ofProposition3.16\nshows that the minimum cannot occur at c, while case (1) shows that the minimum\ncannot occur at d. Therefore g must attain a minimum at a point x in the interval\n(c,d). Moreover, Fermat\u2019s Theorem dictates that g(cid:48)(x) = 0.\nWemayobtainthegeneralresultbytakingg(t) = f(t)\u2212Ltwhenf(cid:48)(c) < L < f(cid:48)(d)\nor g(t) = Lt\u2212f(t) when f(cid:48)(c) > L > f(cid:48)(d).\nHistorical Notes\n(1) The history of the derivative, which spans several centuries, is too complicated\nto discuss in detail. Isaac Newton (1642\u20131726) devised the concept of a flux-\nion in 1665. Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736\u20131813) introduced the term derived 135\nfunction (\u201cfonction d\u00b4eriv\u00b4ee\u201d) in 1797. Augustin-Louis Cauchy presented a con-\ncept similar to the modern definition of the derivative in his Cours d\u2019analyse,\npublished in 1821.\n(2) Edward Charles Titchmarsh (1899\u20131963) may have been the first person to\nuse the term uniformly differentiable, although he did not provide an explicit\ndefinition (see [53, p. 76]). Walter Rudin (1921\u20132010) introduced the concept as\npart of an exercise relating to the result of Theorem 3.23 (see [48, pp. 114\u2013115]).\n(3) Fermat\u2019s Theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat (1607\u20131665), who popular-\nized a related technique for finding maxima and minima. The result presented\ninthischaptershouldnotbeconfusedwithFermat\u2019sLittleTheoremorFermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem, both of which pertain to number theory.\n(4) MichelRolle(1652\u20131719)publishedaproofofRolle\u2019sTheoremin1691,although\nthe original version was limited to polynomials.\n(5) The Mean Value Theorem is often attributed to Lagrange, and is sometimes\ncalled either Lagrange\u2019s Mean Value Theorem or simply Lagrange\u2019s Theorem.\nWhile his treatment of the derivative was rather different from the modern\napproach, Lagrange did employ techniques comparable to the Mean Value The-\norem. Cauchy proved a more standard form of the Mean Value Theorem in a\ntreatise published in 1823, at which point he also introduced the Generalized\nMean Value Theorem (see Exercise 3.23). Cauchy\u2019s proofs required the un-\nstated hypothesis that f(cid:48) is continuous on [a,b]. Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932)\nestablished his version of the Mean Value Theorem (see Exercise 3.24) in 1884. 136\n(6) Darboux\u2019s Theorem is named after Gaston Darboux (1842\u20131917), who pub-\nlished the result in 1875. His initial example of a function with discontinuous\nderivative is presented in Exercise 3.8.\nExercises\nExercise 3.1 Consider the function h: R \u2192 R given by the rule h(t) = t4. Use the\ntechnique demonstrated in Example 3.6 to show that h is differentiable on R, with\nh(cid:48)(t) = 4t3.\nExercise 3.2 Corollary 3.13 shows that f: R \u2192 R, given by the rule f(t) = tn for\nany non-negative integer n, is differentiable on R, with f(cid:48)(t) = ntn\u22121. We would like\nto show that g: (0,\u221e) \u2192 R, given by the rule g(t) = tr for r in Q, is differentiable on\n(0,\u221e), with g(cid:48)(t) = rtr\u22121. We will refer to this result as the power rule for rational\nexponents. (For many values of r, the function g could be defined on a larger domain,\nin which case the power rule would still hold. We will disregard this issue to avoid\ndealing with a multiplicity of special cases.)\na.

As a starting point, we need to define a few basic terms.\nDefinition4.1 Apartition ofaninterval[a,b]isafinitesetofpointsP = {x ,x ,...,x }\n0 1 n\nin [a,b], with a = x < x < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < x = b.\n0 1 n\nAlthough a partition technically consists of n+1 points, we will tend to view it as\nbeing made up of the n corresponding subintervals [x ,x ]. Our next definition is\nk\u22121 k\nan extension of this idea. 144\nDefinition 4.2 A tagged partition of an interval [a,b] consists of a partition P =\n{x ,x ,...,x }, along with a set of tag points {t ,t ,...,t }, with t in [x ,x ] for\n0 1 n 1 2 n k k\u22121 k\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n.\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nWewilltypicallywrite P,{t } torepresentataggedpartition. Insituationswhereit\nk\n\u2022\nis not necessary to note the tag points explicitly, we will use the alternate notation P.\nOne of the major issues underlying the theory of integration is the length of each\nsubinterval [x ,x ] for a certain (tagged) partition. We will use a gauge on [a,b] to\nk\u22121 k\ndescribe this issue precisely.\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nDefinition 4.3 Let\u03b4(t)beagaugeontheinterval[a,b]. Ataggedpartition P,{t }\nk\nof [a,b] is called \u03b4(t)-fine if x \u2212x < \u03b4(t ) for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n.\nk k\u22121 k\nIf the gauge is a constant function on [a,b], the choice of tag points {t } will not\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\naffect whether P,{t } is \u03b4-fine. In this situation, we will often refer to a partition\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nP as being \u03b4-fine, rather than a tagged partition P,{t } .\nk\nDefinition 4.4 For a function f: [a,b] \u2192 R and a tagged partition (cid:0) P,{t }(cid:1) of [a,b],\nk\nthe corresponding Riemann sum is defined\nn\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:88)\nR f,P,{t } = f(t )(x \u2212x ).\nk k k k\u22121\nk=1\n(cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nWhen it will not cause confusion, we will write R f,P in place of R f,P,{t } .\nk\nDefinition 4.5 A function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable on [a,b] (with integral S) if,\nfor every positive number \u03b5, there is a gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b] such that\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212S(cid:12) < \u03b5\n\u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P is \u03b4(t)-fine. 145\nDefinition 4.6 An integrable function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is called Riemann integrable on\n[a,b] if, for every positive number \u03b5, the corresponding gauge \u03b4(t) can be taken to be\na constant function.\nInviewofDefinitions2.3and3.2, itwouldmakesensetousetermuniform integra-\nbility in place of Riemann integrability. Unfortunately, the term uniform integrability\nis already used to refer to a different property, albeit one that pertains to a collection\nof functions rather than an individual function (see [47, p. 93]). More importantly,\nthe term Riemann integrability has an important historical context and is, at this\npoint, entirely universal. Nevertheless, it makes sense to view Riemann integrability\nas the direct analog of uniform continuity and uniform differentiability.\nUnlike the definitions of continuity and differentiability, integrability requires the\nunderlying interval to be compact. This stipulation has nothing to do with the\nendpoints per se, but with the fundamental properties of compact intervals. In par-\nticular, we need the following result, which can be viewed as an alternate version of\nthe Heine\u2013Borel Property.\nLemma 4.7 (Cousin\u2019s Lemma) For every gauge \u03b4(t) on a compact interval [a,b],\n\u2022 (cid:0) (cid:1)\nthere is a tagged partition P = P,{t } that is \u03b4(t)-fine.\nk\nItisfairlystraightforwardtocomposeaself-containedargumentthatessentiallyrepli-\ncates our proof of the Heine\u2013Borel Property (see Exercise 4.1). In the interest of\navoiding redundancy, we will construct a proof that appeals to that property directly.\nProof. Let \u03b4(t) be a gauge on [a,b]. For each t in [a,b], consider the neighborhood\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nV t,\u03b4(t)/2 . The collection {V t,\u03b4(t)/2 : t \u2208 [a,b]} covers [a,b], so the Heine\u2013Borel\n(cid:8) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:9)\nProperty guarantees that there is a finite subcollection V t ,\u03b4(t )/2 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n\nk k 146\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nthat also covers [a,b]. We can assume that none of the sets V t ,\u03b4(t )/2 \u2229 [a,b]\nk k\nis contained within any other such set; if there were such a redundancy, it could be\neliminated without affecting the subcover. Without loss of generality, assume that\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nt < t < ... < t . To simplify notation, we will write V to denote V t ,\u03b4(t )/2 .\n1 2 n k k k\nNote that any two consecutive neighborhoods V and V must overlap.\nk k+1\nNow we shall construct the tagged partition of [a,b], consisting of n subintervals,\nthat is \u03b4(t)-fine. First of all, take {t : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n} to be the tag points. For the\nk\npartition points themselves, let x = a and x = b; for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1, take x be\n0 n k\nany point in V \u2229V that is between t and t . By construction, t \u2208 [x ,x ]\nk k+1 k k+1 k k\u22121 k\nand [x ,x ] \u2282 V for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Hence the length of each subinterval [x ,x ] is\nk\u22121 k k k\u22121 k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nless than the length of V , which is \u03b4(t ), and thus the tagged partition P,{t } is\nk k k\n\u03b4(t)-fine.\nExercise 4.2 asks the reader to demonstrate that the result of Cousin\u2019s Lemma\ndoes not hold for other types of intervals. Definition 4.5 would be meaningless in\nsuch a context, as every function would be integrable (in a vacuous sense), with the\nintegral being equal to any value.\nThere is still one more basic result we need to prove.\nProposition 4.8 If a function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable, its integral has a unique\nvalue.\nProof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are two distinct values S\n1\nand S that satisfy Definition 4.5. Let \u03b5 = |S \u2212 S |/2. By assumption, there is a\n2 1 2\ngauge \u03b4 (t) on [a,b] such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212S (cid:12) < \u03b5\n1 147\n\u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P is \u03b4 (t)-fine. Likewise, there is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on [a,b]\n1 2\nsuch that\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212S (cid:12) < \u03b5\n2\n\u2022 (cid:8) (cid:9)\nwhenever P is \u03b4 (t)-fine. Consider the gauge \u03b4(t) = min \u03b4 (t),\u03b4 (t) . By Cousin\u2019s\n2 1 2\n\u2022\nLemma, there is a tagged partition P that is \u03b4(t)-fine, which is therefore both \u03b4 (t)-\n1\nfine and \u03b4 (t)-fine. For such a tagged partition, we see that\n2\n(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:12)\n|S \u2212S | = (cid:12) S \u2212R f,P + R f,P \u2212S (cid:12)\n1 2 1 2\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12)\n\u2264 (cid:12)R f,P \u2212S (cid:12)+(cid:12)R f,P \u2212S (cid:12)\n1 2\n< \u03b5+\u03b5 = |S \u2212S |,\n1 2\nwhich is a contradiction.\n(cid:82)b\nIn view of this fact, we will use the standard notation f to refer to the (unique)\na\nintegral of f over the interval [a,b].\nEven though we will not typically use Definition 4.5 to evaluate integrals directly,\nwe will conclude this section with a few concrete examples.\nExample 4.9 Consider a constant function f(t) = \u03b1, defined on an interval [a,b].\nObserve that\nn n\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:88) (cid:88)\nR f,P,{t } = f(t )(x \u2212x ) = \u03b1 (x \u2212x ) = \u03b1(b\u2212a)\nk k k k\u22121 k k\u22121\nk=1 k=1\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nfor any tagged partition P,{t } . Thus, for any positive \u03b5, we see that\nk\n(cid:12) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)R f,P,{t } \u2212\u03b1(b\u2212a)(cid:12) < \u03b5\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nwhenever P,{t } is \u03b4(t)-fine, regardless of the gauge \u03b4(t). Consequently\nk\n(cid:90) b\nf = \u03b1(b\u2212a).\na 148\nAs we may choose the gauge to be a constant function, f is Riemann integrable.\nExample 4.10 Consider the function g: [a,b] \u2192 R defined by the rule g(t) = t. Let\n\u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and define the constant gauge \u03b4 = 2\u03b5/(b\u2212a). Let\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nP,{t } be a tagged partition that is \u03b4-fine; that is, every subinterval has length less\nk\nthan \u03b4.

(4.1)\nk k k\u22121\n(cid:12) 2 (cid:12)\nk=1\nSince (x +x )/2 is the midpoint of the subinterval [x ,x ], the distance between\nk k\u22121 k\u22121 k\nt and (x +x )/2 is less than or equal to half the length of the subinterval.

In this situation, the function f\nj\nis Riemann integrable on [a,b].\nProposition 4.20 Suppose f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable on [a,b]. If g: [a,b] \u2192 R is\nidentical to f except on a set E that is either finite or countably infinite, then g is\n(cid:82)b (cid:82)b\nintegrable on [a,b] and g = f. Moreover, if f is Riemann integrable and E is\na a\nfinite, then g is Riemann integrable on [a,b].\nProof. As in the proof of Proposition 4.16, define the function h = g \u2212 f. Since h\nis equal to 0 except on the set E, Proposition 4.19 dictates that h is integrable and\n(cid:82)b (cid:82)b (cid:82)b (cid:82)b (cid:82)b\nthat h = 0. Thus g = f +h is also integrable, with g = f + h = f.\na a a a a\nIf the set E is finite, then h = g \u2212f is Riemann integrable. If f is also Riemann\nintegrable, then so is the function g = f +h. 160\nExercises4.5and4.16bothrelatetothequestionofwhetherRiemannintegrability\nis preserved when E is countably infinite. Although beyond the scope of our present\ndiscussion, there are stronger versions of the statements relating to integrability, for\nwhich the set E could potentially be uncountable (see Question 4.45 below).\nThe final result of this section pertains solely to Riemann integrability.\nProposition 4.21 A function f: [a,b] \u2192 R that is Riemann integrable must be\nbounded on [a,b].\nProof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is an unbounded function\nf: [a,b] \u2192 R that is Riemann integrable, with the value of the integral being S.\nTaking \u03b5 = 1, we know there is a constant gauge \u03b4 such that\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212S(cid:12) < 1,\nwhenever the partition P is \u03b4-fine.\nLet P be a partition of [a,b], consisting of n subintervals of length less than\n\u03b4. There must be at least one subinterval [x ,x ] on which the function f is\nm\u22121 m\nunbounded. Choose any set of tag points {t ,...,t ,t ,...,t } for each of the\n1 m\u22121 m+1 n\nother n\u22121 subintervals.

The assumption of Riemann integrability allows us to choose the subintervals\nfirst, followed by the tag points, whereas the assumption of integrability requires that\nboth be chosen simultaneously.\n4.3 A Non-Integrable Function\nAt this point, we will step aside from our methodical treatment of this material\nto provide a much-needed example: a function that is not integrable on a particular\ninterval. Consider g: [0,1] \u2192 R defined by the rule\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 , 0 < t \u2264 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2t\ng(t) = .

Be-\nfore proceeding further, we will need to introduce a definition, a lemma, and some\nadditional notation. 162\nDefinition 4.22 A partition Q of [a,b] is called a refinement of a partition P if\nP \u2286 Q; that is, if every partition point of P is also a partition point of Q.\nLemma 4.23 (\u201cSecond Cousin\u2019s Lemma\u201d) Let P be a partition of [a,b]. For every\n\u2022\ngauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b], there is a tagged partition Q that is \u03b4(t)-fine, where Q is a\nrefinement of P.\nProof. LetP = {x ,x ,...,x }. ApplyCousin\u2019sLemmatoeachsubinterval[x ,x ]\n0 1 n k\u22121 k\nto obtain a tagged partition of the subinterval that is \u03b4(t)-fine, where the gauge \u03b4(t)\nacts only on [x ,x ]. Combining the partition points and tags associated with each\nk\u22121 k\n\u2022\nsubinterval, we obtain a tagged partition Q of [a,b] with the desired properties.\nFinally, consider a partition P = {x ,x ,...,x } of an interval [a,b]. If a function\n0 1 n\nf: [a,b] \u2192 R is bounded on a subinterval [x ,x ], define\nk\u22121 k\n(cid:96) [f,P] = inf{f(t) : t \u2208 [x ,x ]}\nk k\u22121 k\nand\nu [f,P] = sup{f(t) : t \u2208 [x ,x ]}.\nk k\u22121 k\nWewillonlymakeuseoftheexpression(cid:96) [g,P]inthisexample,althoughthisnotation\nk\nwill figure prominently in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.\nWe are now in a position to show that the function g, as defined in (4.3), is not\n(cid:82)1\nintegrable on [0,1]. Suppose, to the contrary, that g is integrable and that g = S.\n0\n(Proposition 4.15 dictates that S must be non-negative.) Taking \u03b5 = 1, we know\nthere is a gauge \u03b4(t) on [0,1] such that\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)R g,P \u2212S(cid:12) < 1 163\n\u2022 (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) \u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P is \u03b4(t)-fine. Hence R g,P < S +1 whenever P is\n\u03b4(t)-fine. For a natural number n, consider the partition\n(cid:8) (cid:9)\nP = 0, 1, 1 ,..., 1,1 ,\nn n n\u22121 2\nso that x = 0 and x = 1/(n\u2212k +1) for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n.

The following theorem\nprovides such a characterization.\nTheorem 4.24 (Cauchy Criterion for Integrability) A function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is\nintegrable if and only if, for every positive number \u03b5, there is a gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b]\nsuch that\n(cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1)(cid:12)\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212R f,Q (cid:12) < \u03b5 (4.4)\n\u2022 \u2022\nwhenever P \u2286 Q and both the tagged partitions P and Q are \u03b4(t)-fine.\nProof.

In fact, only\none partition is needed to guarantee Riemann integrability. The following proof is\nsomewhat technical, but the result is definitely worthwhile.\nProposition 4.27 A bounded function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is Riemann integrable on [a,b]\nif, for every positive number \u03b5, there is a partition P of [a,b] such that\nU(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) < \u03b5.\nProof. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number and let P = {x ,x ,...,x } be a par-\n0 1 n\ntition of [a,b] with the property that\n\u03b5\nU(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) < .\n3\nLet n denote the number of subintervals in P and let M be an upper bound for |f|.\nTake \u03b4 = \u03b5/(9Mn).

Note that (cid:96) [f,P] is a lower bound for f on all of\nk\u22121 k k\nthese subintervals and that u [f,P] is an upper bound. Let \u03b3 denote the length of\nk k 170\nthe portion of [x ,x ] that is not covered by such a subinterval in Q, which for\nk\u22121 k\neach k must be less than 2\u03b4.

This criterion, or the similar one described in\nExercise4.15, isoftentakentobethefundamentaldefinitionofRiemannintegrability.\n4.5 Additional Properties of the Integral\nThis section presents several additional properties of the integral, whose proofs\nrequire either the Cauchy or Darboux Criterion. We begin with a result that should\nbe familiar to every former student of calculus.\nTheorem 4.29 A function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable on [a,b] if and only if, for any\na < c < b, the function is integrable on both [a,c] and [c,b]. Moreover,\n(cid:90) b (cid:90) c (cid:90) b\nf = f + f (4.6)\na a c 174\nwhenever these integrals exist.\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that f is integrable on both [a,c] and [c,b]. Let \u03b5 be an\narbitrary positive number. There is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on [a,c] such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022 (cid:1) (cid:90) c (cid:12) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212 f(cid:12) <\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12) 2\na\n\u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P of [a,c] is \u03b4 (t)-fine. Likewise, there is a gauge \u03b4 (t)\n1 1 2\non [c,b] such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022 (cid:1) (cid:90) c (cid:12) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212 f(cid:12) <\n2\n(cid:12) (cid:12) 2\na\n\u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P of [c,b] is \u03b4 (t)-fine. Define the gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b]\n2 2\nin the following manner:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4min{\u03b4 (t),c\u2212t}, a \u2264 t < c\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b4(t) = .

Consider a subinterval [x ,x ]\nm\u22121 m\nthatcontainsthepointc. Thecorrespondingtagpointt mustbec; ifnot, thelength\nm\nof the subinterval would be less than |c \u2212 t |, which would make it impossible for\nm\nt and c to belong to the same subinterval. It is possible that c is the tag point\nm\nfor two adjacent subintervals. If that is not the case, we can make it so by breaking\n[x ,x ] into [x ,c] and [c,x ]. Observe that\nm\u22121 m m\u22121 m\nf(c)(x \u2212x ) = f(c)(x \u2212c)+f(c)(c\u2212x ),\nm m\u22121 m m\u22121\n(cid:0) \u2022(cid:1)\nso the additional subinterval does not affect the value of R f,P . Having made this\n\u2022 \u2022\nslight modification to P, we define P to be the tagged partition of [a,c] consisting\n1 175\n\u2022\nof all partition points and tag points of P that belong to [a,c]. Define the tagged\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\npartition P of [c,b] analogously.

Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive num-\nber and take \u03b4(t) to be a corresponding gauge on [a,b] guaranteed by the Cauchy\n\u2022 \u2022\nCriterion. Consider \u03b4(t) acting on the subinterval [a,c]. Let P and Q be tagged\n1 1\n\u2022\npartitions of [a,c] that are \u03b4(t)-fine. Let P be a tagged partition of [c,b] that is\n2\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u03b4(t)-fine. Let P \u222aP denote the tagged partition of [a,b] created by combining the\n1 2\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\npartition points and tag points of P and P .

A similar argument shows that f is also inte-\ngrable on [c,b]. Equation (4.6) therefore follows from the first half of the proof. 176\nIn this instance, Theorem 4.29 cannot be adapted to Riemann integrability simply\nbytakingallthegaugestobeconstant. Indeed,thegaugedefinedinexpression(4.7)is\nfundamentally nonconstant. The corresponding result still holds, though, for slightly\ndifferent reasons.\nTheorem 4.30 A function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is Riemann integrable on [a,b] if and only\nif, for any a < c < b, the function is Riemann integrable on both [a,c] and [c,b].\nProof. The second half of the proof of Theorem 4.29, where we assume that f is\nintegrable on [a,b], can be directly adapted to this situation by taking the gauge \u03b4(t)\nto be constant.\nSuppose then that f is Riemann integrable on both [a,c] and [c,b]. Although we\ncould modify the relevant portion of the proof of Theorem 4.29, making use of the\nfact that f is bounded on [a,b], it is simpler to use the Darboux Criterion. Let \u03b5 be\nan arbitrary positive number. There must be a partition P of [a,c] such that\n1\n\u03b5\nU(f,P )\u2212L(f,P ) <\n1 1\n2\nand a partition P of [c,b] such that\n2\n\u03b5\nU(f,P )\u2212L(f,P ) < .\n2 2\n2\nObserve that P = P \u222aP is a partition of [a,b], with\n1 2\nL(f,P) = L(f,P )+L(f,P )\n1 2\nand\nU(f,P) = U(f,P )+U(f,P ).\n1 2 177\nTherefore\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\nU(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) = U(f,P )\u2212L(f,P ) + U(f,P )\u2212L(f,P )\n1 1 2 2\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5,\n2 2\nso f is Riemann integrable on [a,b].\nThe importance of Theorems 4.29 and 4.30 should not be underestimated. These\nresults are not simply computational tools, but a fundamental statement about the\nnature of integration. The following corollary is a direct consequence of these two\ntheorems.\nCorollary 4.31 Let P = {x ,x ,...,x } be a partition of [a,b]. A function\n0 1 n\nf: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable on [a,b] if and only if f is integrable on each subinter-\nval [x ,x ], in which case\nk\u22121 k\n(cid:90) b n (cid:90) x\n(cid:88) k\nf = f.\na x\nk=1 k\u22121\nLikewise, f is Riemann integrable on [a,b] if and only if f is Riemann integrable on\neach subinterval [x ,x ].\nk\u22121 k\nItmaybeoverkilltostateournextobservationexplicitly,butwewilldosoanyway.\nCorollary 4.32 Let P = {x ,x ,...,x } be a partition of [a,b]. A function\n0 1 n\nf: [a,b] \u2192 R that takes on a constant value \u03b1 on each open subinterval (x ,x ) is\nk k\u22121 k\nRiemann integrable on [a,b], with\n(cid:90) b n\n(cid:88)\nf = \u03b1 (x \u2212x ).\nk k k\u22121\na\nk=1\nProof. Proposition 4.20 shows that the behavior of f on the finite set of partition\npoints has no effect on the Riemann integrability of f or the value of the integral.\nThus the stated result follows from Example 4.9 and Corollary 4.31. 178\nThis corollary provides an easy verification of the result from Example 4.11. It\nalso allows for a slightly more direct treatment of the non-integrability of the function\ng: [0,1] \u2192 R described in Section 4.3 (see Exercise 4.19).\nThe remainder of this section will focus on properties pertaining to Riemann\nintegrability. For f: [a,b] \u2192 R, define the functions f+ and f\u2212 on [a,b] as follows:\nf+(t) = max{f(t),0}\nand\nf\u2212(t) = max{\u2212f(t),0}.\nObserve that f = f+\u2212f\u2212 and |f| = f++f\u2212. Moreover, we have the following result.\nProposition 4.33 If f: [a,b] \u2192 R is Riemann integrable, then so are the functions\nf+, f\u2212, and |f|.\nProof. Let \u03b5 an arbitrary positive number. Since f is Riemann integrable, there is a\npartition P such that\nU(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) < \u03b5.\nFor a particular subinterval [x ,x ], consider the relationship between the differ-\nk\u22121 k\nences u [f+,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f+,P] and u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P]. There are three possible cases:\nk k k k\n\u2022 If f is non-negative on the entire subinterval, then u [f+,P] = u [f,P] and\nk k\n(cid:96) [f+,P] = (cid:96) [f,P].\nk k\n\u2022 If f is negative on the entire subinterval, then u [f+,P] = (cid:96) [f+,P] = 0.\nk k\n\u2022 If f attains both non-negative and negative values on the subinterval, then\nu [f+,P] = u [f,P] and (cid:96) [f+,P] = 0.\nk k k 179\nIn any of these situations, we have\nu [f+,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f+,P] \u2264 u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P].\nk k k k\nConsequently\nn\n(cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\nU(f+,P)\u2212L(f+,P) = u [f+,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f+,P] (x \u2212x )\nk k k k\u22121\nk=1\nn\n(cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\n\u2264 u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P] (x \u2212x )\nk k k k\u22121\nk=1\n= U(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) < \u03b5.\nTherefore f+ is also Riemann integrable.\nSince f and f+ are both Riemann integrable, Proposition 4.14 dictates that the\nfunction f\u2212 = f+\u2212f is Riemann integrable. Likewise, |f| = f++f\u2212 is also Riemann\nintegrable.\nAs we mentioned in Section 4.2, omitting the hypothesis of Riemann integrability\nallows for the possibility that f is integrable while |f| is not (see Example 4.39).\nThe Darboux Criterion also allows us to demonstrate that several important\nclasses of functions are Riemann integrable. The next two results, while not sur-\nprising to most readers, should still be rather satisfying.\nCorollary 4.34 Any continuous function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is Riemann integrable.\nProof. Theorem 2.16 guarantees that any continuous function f is uniformly contin-\nuous on the compact interval [a,b], which also means that f is bounded on [a,b].\nHence, for any positive \u03b5, there is a constant gauge \u03b4 on [a,b] such that\n\u03b5\n|f(s)\u2212f(t)| <\n2(b\u2212a) 180\nwhenever |s\u2212t| < \u03b4. Let P be any partition of [a,b] that is \u03b4-fine. Since the length of\neverysubinterval[x ,x ]islessthan\u03b4, itfollowsthatu [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P] \u2264 \u03b5/2(b\u2212a)\nk\u22121 k k k\nfor all k. Consequently\nn\n(cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\nU(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) = u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P] (x \u2212x )\nk k k k\u22121\nk=1\nn\n\u03b5 (cid:88)\n\u2264 (x \u2212x )\nk k\u22121\n2(b\u2212a)\nk=1\n\u03b5\n= \u00b7(b\u2212a) < \u03b5,\n2(b\u2212a)\nso f is Riemann integrable on [a,b].\nCorollary 4.35 Any monotonic function f: [a,b] \u2192 R is Riemann integrable.\nProof. Consider the case where f is non-decreasing. First of all, note that f(a) \u2264\nf(t) \u2264 f(b) for a \u2264 t \u2264 b, so the function f is bounded on [a,b]. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary\npositive number and take\n\u03b5\n\u03b4 = .\nf(b)\u2212f(a)\n(We may safely assume that f is not constant, so the denominator is nonzero.) Let P\nbe any partition of [a,b] that is \u03b4-fine. Observe that (cid:96) [f,P], the infimum on the first\n1\nsubinterval, equals f(a); likewise, u [f,P], the supremum on the final subinterval,\nn\nequals f(b). Moreover, u [f,P] = (cid:96) [f,P] for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Consequently\nk\u22121 k\nn\n(cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\nU(f,P)\u2212L(f,P) = u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P] (x \u2212x )\nk k k k\u22121\nk=1\nn\n\u03b5 (cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\n< u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P]\nk k\nf(b)\u2212f(a)\nk=1\n(cid:32) (cid:33)\nn\n\u03b5 (cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\n= u [f,P]\u2212(cid:96) [f,P] \u2212(cid:96) [f,P]+u [f,P]\nk\u22121 k 1 n\nf(b)\u2212f(a)\nk=2\n\u03b5\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\n= \u00b7 f(b)\u2212f(a) = \u03b5.\nf(b)\u2212f(a) 181\nWe may apply a similar argument when f is non-increasing (see Exercise 4.20), or\nsimply note that \u2212f is non-decreasing and hence Riemann integrable.\n4.6 Fundamental Theorems\nAs anyone reading this chapter is probably aware, there is a fundamental connec-\ntion between integration and differentiation. The following result is perhaps the most\nfamiliar manifestation of this principle.\nTheorem 4.36 Suppose a function F: [a,b] \u2192 R is differentiable on [a,b], with\nF(cid:48) = f. The function f is integrable on [a,b], with\n(cid:90) b\nf = F(b)\u2212F(a).\na\nProof. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since F is differentiable on [a,b], there\nis a gauge \u03b4(t) on [a,b] such that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)F(s)\u2212F(t) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12) \u2212f(t)(cid:12) < (4.8)\n(cid:12) s\u2212t (cid:12) b\u2212a\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nwhenever 0 < |s \u2212 t| < \u03b4(t). Let P,{t } be a tagged partition of [a,b] that is\nk\n\u03b4(t)-fine.\nConsider a particular subinterval [x ,x ]. Observe that\nk\u22121 k\n(cid:12) (cid:0) (cid:1)(cid:12) |s\u2212t k|\u03b5\n(cid:12)f(t )(s\u2212t )\u2212 F(s)\u2212F(t ) (cid:12) < (4.9)\nk k k\nb\u2212a\nfor any s in [x ,x ], as long as s (cid:54)= t .

(If F is uniformly differentiable, one can take\nthe gauge \u03b4(t) associated with expression (4.8) to be constant.) This fact could also\nbe deduced simply by combining the results of Theorem 3.23 and Corollary 4.34.\nThe ideas underlying Theorem 4.36 can sometimes be applied in a more general\nsetting, as illustrated in the following example. 183\nExample 4.37 Consider the function h: [0,1] \u2192 R introduced in Example 4.13:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4\u221a , 0 < t \u2264 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 t\nh(t) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f40, t = 0\n\uf8f3\nWewillmodifytheproofofTheorem4.36toprovideamorestraightforwardtreatment\nof this example.\n\u221a\nConsider the function H: [0,1] \u2192 R defined by the rule H(t) = 2 t.

While not every function obtained by integration is\ndifferentiable at every point, we are able to make the following observations.\nTheorem 4.40 Suppose f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable and let c be a point in [a,b]. For\nany t in [a,b], define\n(cid:90) t\nF(t) = f.\nc\nThe function F: [a,b] \u2192 R has the following properties:\n(1) The function F is uniformly continuous on [a,b].\n(2) The function F is differentiable at any point t for which f is continuous, with\nF(cid:48)(t) = f(t). 189\nProof. First of all, Corollary 4.31 shows that f is integrable on [c,t] whenever c <\nt \u2264 b, which means that F(t) is defined. If a \u2264 t \u2264 c, simply take\n(cid:90) t (cid:90) c\nF(t) = f = \u2212 f,\nc t\nwhich is also defined. According to this convention, the value of F(c) must be 0. We\nwill now consider the main components of the theorem.\n(1) This assertion is fairly easy to prove when f is bounded on [a,b] (see Exercise\n4.24), but is more difficult to demonstrate in general. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive\nnumber. Since f is integrable on [a,b], there is a gauge \u03b4 (t) on [a,b] such that\n0\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022(cid:1) (cid:90) b (cid:12) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212 f(cid:12) <\n(cid:12) (cid:12) 6\na\n\u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P of [a,b] is \u03b4 (t)-fine.

We will divide [a,b]\ninto (at most) three subintervals: [a,t], [t,s], and [s,b]. (We ignore any subinterval\nthat only consists of a single point.) Corollary 4.31 dictates that f is integrable on\nall three subintervals, with\n(cid:90) b (cid:90) t (cid:90) s (cid:90) b\nf = f + f + f.\na a t s\nSince f is integrable on [a,t], there is a gauge \u03b4 (u) on [a,t] such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) \u2022 (cid:1) (cid:90) t (cid:12) (cid:12) \u03b5\n(cid:12)R f,P \u2212 f(cid:12) <\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12) 6\na 190\n\u2022\nwhenever the tagged partition P of [a,t] is \u03b4 (u)-fine.

A similar argument yields the same result when t\u2212\u03b4(t) <\ns < t, so we conclude that F is continuous on [a,b]. Theorem 2.16 dictates that F\nmust, in fact, be uniformly continuous on [a,b].\n(2) Suppose f is continuous at a point t in [a,b] and let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive\nnumber.

A similar argument yields the same result when t\u2212\u03b4 < s < t.\nConsequently F is differentiable at t, with F(cid:48)(t) = f(t).\nIn terms of the notation introduced in Chapters 2 and 3, the second part of this\ntheorem says that C \u2286 D . One can make a stronger statement about the size of\nf F\nthe set D , but such a result requires a degree of technical proficiency beyond what\nF\nwe currently possess (see Question 4.47 below).\nExample 4.41 Consider g: [0,5] \u2192 R given by the rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f47, 0 \u2264 t < 3\n\uf8f2\ng(t) = ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3\u22122, 3 \u2264 t \u2264 5\nwhich was introduced in Example 4.11.

Let 0 < a < 1 < b and consider the function\nf: [a,b] \u2192 R given by the rule f(u) = 1/u. Define log: [a,b] \u2192 R by taking\n(cid:90) t\nlogt = f.\n1\nSincef iscontinuouson[a,b], Theorem4.40dictatesthatlog isdifferentiableon[a,b],\nwith (log)(cid:48)(t) = 1/t. By choosing appropriate values for a and b, we may define the\nnatural logarithm for any positive value of t. Exercise 4.26 asks the reader to verify\nsome of the more important properties of this function.\n4.7 Unresolved Questions\nWhile the treatment of integration in this chapter was quite comprehensive, there\nare still several important questions that remain unresolved. Some of the following\nissues were mentioned explicitly in this chapter, while others may have occurred to\nthe attentive reader.\nQuestion 4.43 Is there a bounded function f: [a,b] \u2192 R that is not integrable?\nThe answer to this question is affirmative, although the construction depends on the\nexistence of a non-measurable set. This concept is beyond the scope of this text, but 194\nthe basic idea is that we would need to identify a subset of [a,b] that cannot have\neither positive length or length 0 (see [47, p. 48]).\nQuestion 4.44 In reference to Example 4.39 and Exercise 4.8, is there a function\nf: [a,b] \u2192 R such that |f| is integrable on [a,b], but f is not? The answer is\nonce again affirmative, with the construction depending on the existence of a non-\nmeasurable set.\nQuestion 4.45 Suppose f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable. In reference to Propositions\n4.19 and 4.20, how do we describe a possibly uncountable set E such that, whenever\ng differs from f on E, the function g is guaranteed to be integrable on [a,b] and\n(cid:82)b (cid:82)b\ng = f?\na a\nQuestion 4.46 In reference to Question 4.45, can Theorem 4.38 be extended to\nallow the set E to be uncountable? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer turns out to be\nnegative.\nQuestion 4.47 In reference to Theorem 4.40, if f: [a,b] \u2192 R is integrable, how do\nwe precisely describe the set D on which the function\nF\n(cid:90) t\nF(t) = f\nc\nis differentiable? The answer again relates to the concept of a set with measure zero.\nHistorical Notes\n(1) As in the case of the derivative, the integral has a long and complicated his-\ntory. While there were foreshadowings of the integral in classical antiquity, the\n(cid:82)\nmodern concept began to emerge in the 17th century. The symbol , standing 195\nfor summa, was first used by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) in 1675.\nThe term integral appeared in print for the first time in 1690, in the writings\nof Jacob Bernoulli.\n(2) The formulation of the integral presented in this text is often referred to as\nthe Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral, the generalized Riemann integral, or the gauge\nintegral. We have eschewed all those names, to emphasize the primacy of this\ndefinition. While there had been several precursors, the majority of the relevant\ntheory was developed by Ralph Henstock (1923\u20132007) and Jaroslav Kurzweil\n(1926\u20132022), beginning in the mid-1950s.\n(3) Bernhard Riemann (1826\u20131866) introduced his definition of the integral in late\n1853,althoughitwasnotpublisheduntil1868. Riemann\u2019sversionoftheintegral\nhasbecomeubiquitousattheundergraduatelevel, althoughitisoftenpresented\nin a manner more consistent with Darboux\u2019s treatment (e.g., Theorem 4.28).\n(4) Cousin\u2019s Lemma is derived from a result proved by Pierre Cousin (1867\u20131933)\nin 1895. Cousin\u2019s work did not explicitly refer to gauges, although it did relate\nto the Heine\u2013Borel Property.\n(5) Theorem 4.28 was established by Gaston Darboux in 1875, in the same paper in\nwhich he proved his eponymous theorem. (See Exercise 4.15, which also relates\nto Darboux\u2019s characterization of integrability.) The lower sum L(f,P) and the\nupper sum U(f,P), introduced in Section 4.4, are often called Darboux sums.\n(6) It would be impossible to attribute the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to\nany single mathematician.

H. Hardy, Divergent Series (1949)\n5.1 Properties of Sequences\nThe purpose of this section is the establish a number of fundamental facts relat-\ning to sequences.

A point x in I belongs to the set of continuity C if and only if, for every\nf\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nsequence (a ) of points in I converging to x, the sequence f(a ) converges to f(x).\nk k\nWhileweoftenusethisresulttodeterminewhetheraparticularfunctioniscontin-\nuous, it also allows us to obtain information about sequences. For example, Exercise\n2.6 shows that any function g: [0,\u221e) \u2192 R, given by the rule g(t) = t1/n for a natural\nnumber n \u2265 2, is continuous on [0,\u221e). Hence, for any sequence (a ) of non-negative\nk\n(cid:0) a1/n(cid:1)\nnumbers converging to a limit a, the sequence converges to a1/n. The following\nk\ntheorem, first mentioned in Chapter 1, builds on this observation.\nTheorem 5.1 (Algebraic Limit Theorem) If the sequences (a ) and (b ) converge\nk k\nto the numbers a and b respectively, then:\n(1) The sequence (a +b ) converges to a+b.\nk k\n(2) For any constant c, the sequence (ca ) converges to ca.\nk\n(3) The sequence (a b ) converges to ab.\nk k\n(4) The sequence (a /b ) converges to a/b, as long as b (cid:54)= 0 for all k in N and\nk k k\nb (cid:54)= 0.\nProof. (1) Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since (a ) converges to a and\nk\n(b ) converges to b, there are natural numbers K and K such that |a \u2212 a| < \u03b5/2\nk 1 2 k\nwhenever k \u2265 K and |b \u2212 b| < \u03b5/2 whenever k \u2265 K . Take K = max{K ,K }.\n1 k 2 1 2 207\nObserve that\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(a +b )\u2212(a+b)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(a \u2212a)+(b \u2212b)(cid:12)\nk k k k\n\u2264 |a \u2212a|+|b \u2212b|\nk k\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5\n2 2\nwhenever k \u2265 K, so we conclude that (a +b ) converges to a+b.\nk k\n(2) The function f: R \u2192 R given by the rule f(t) = ct is continuous on R, so this\nresult follows from Proposition 2.13.\n(3) Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since (a ) converges to a, there is a\nk\nnatural number K such that |a \u2212 a| < \u03b5/(2|b| + 1) whenever k \u2265 K . Moreover,\n1 k 1\nsince any convergent sequence is bounded, there is a positive number M such that\n|a | \u2264 M for all k in N. Since (b ) converges to b, there is a natural number K such\nk k 2\nthat |b \u2212b| < \u03b5/(2M) whenever k \u2265 K . Take K = max{K ,K }. Observe that\nk 2 1 2\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n|a b \u2212ab| = (cid:12)(a b \u2212a b)+(a b\u2212ab)(cid:12)\nk k k k k k\n\u2264 |a ||b \u2212b|+|a \u2212a||b|\nk k k\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< M \u00b7 +|b|\u00b7 < \u03b5\n2M 2|b|+1\nwhenever k \u2265 K.

The more general\nk\nassertion follows from part (3).\nThe Algebraic Limit Theorem leads to another important, albeit somewhat pre-\ndictable result. 208\nTheorem 5.2 (Order Limit Theorem) Suppose the sequences (a ) and (b ) converge\nk k\nto the numbers a and b respectively. If there is a natural number K such that a \u2264 b\nk k\nwhenever k \u2265 K, then a \u2264 b.\nProof. The Algebraic Limit Theorem dictates that the sequence (a \u2212b ) converges to\nk k\nthe number a\u2212b. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that a > b. Since a\u2212b > 0,\nthere must be a natural number K such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(a \u2212b )\u2212(a\u2212b)(cid:12) < a\u2212b\nk k\nwhenever k \u2265 K . In other words,\n1\n0 < a \u2212b < 2(a\u2212b)\nk k\nfor k \u2265 K . This observation contradicts the assumption that a \u2212b \u2264 0 whenever\n1 k k\nk \u2265 K, so we conclude that a \u2264 b.\nThis theorem often manifests itself in a somewhat simpler form.\nCorollary 5.3 Suppose a sequence (a ) converges to a. If there is a natural number\nk\nK such that a \u2264 x whenever k \u2265 K, then a \u2264 x. If there is a natural number K\nk\nsuch that y \u2264 a whenever k \u2265 K, then y \u2264 a.\nk\nProof. Simply apply the Order Limit Theorem, with one of the two sequences being\nconstant.\nBefore stating our next result, we will need to adapt the terminology introduced\nin Definitions 2.22 and 2.23.\nDefinition 5.4 A sequence (a ) is called non-decreasing if a \u2264 a for all k in N.\nk k k+1\nSimilarly, (a ) is called non-increasing if a \u2265 a for all k in N. A sequence that is\nk k k+1\neither non-decreasing or non-increasing is called monotonic. 209\nDefinition 5.5 A sequence (a ) is called increasing if a < a for all k in N.\nk k k+1\nSimilarly, (a ) is called decreasing if a > a for all k in N.\nk k k+1\nTheorem 5.6 (Monotone Convergence Theorem) A monotonic sequence is conver-\ngent if and only if it is bounded.\nProof. Corollary 1.24 dictates that any convergent sequence is bounded, regardless\nof whether it is monotonic. Suppose then that (a ) is a bounded, non-decreasing\nk\nsequence. Hence {a : k \u2208 N} is bounded, so the set must have a supremum M. For\nk\nanarbitrarypositivenumber\u03b5, Proposition1.4dictatesthatthereis an elementa in\nK\n{a : k \u2208 N} such that M \u2212\u03b5 < a \u2264 M. Since the sequence (a ) is non-decreasing,\nk K k\nit follows that\nM \u2212\u03b5 < a \u2264 a \u2264 M < M +\u03b5\nK k\nfor k \u2265 K. Consequently |a \u2212 M| < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K, so the sequence (a )\nk k\nconverges to M.\nA similar argument holds when (a ) is bounded and non-increasing, or we may\nk\nsimply consider the non-decreasing sequence (\u2212a ).\nk\nFor the purpose of applying the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it is helpful to\nnote that a non-decreasing sequence is bounded if and only if it is bounded above.\nLikewise, a non-increasing sequence is bounded if and only if it is bounded below.

If we let S be the\nk 1\nset of all odd natural numbers, the corresponding subsequence would be\n(a ) = (a ,a ,a ,a ,...) = (1,9,25,49,...).\n2j\u22121 1 3 5 7\nLikewise, if S is the set of all even natural numbers, the corresponding subsequence\n2\nis\n(a ) = (a ,a ,a ,a ,...) = (4,16,36,64,...).\n2j 2 4 6 8\nIn this case, note that (2j \u2212 1) = (1,3,5,7,...) and (2j) = (2,4,6,8,...) are the\nincreasing sequences consisting of all the elements of S and S respectively.\n1 2\nIn this setting, there is a clear connection between the convergence of a sequence\nand the convergence of any of its subsequences.\nProposition 5.7 If a sequence (a ) converges to a number x, any subsequence (a )\nk kj\nalso converges to x.\nProof. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. If (a ) converges to x, there must be a\nk\nnatural number K such that |a \u2212x| < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K. Since (k ) is an increasing\nk j\nsequence of natural numbers, it follows that k \u2265 j for all j in N. Consequently\nj\n|a \u2212x| < \u03b5 whenever j \u2265 K, so (a ) also converges to x.\nkj kj\nProposition 5.7 provides a simple criterion for showing that a sequence diverges.\nIf two subsequences of (a ) converge to different values, the original sequence must\nk\ndiverge. Consider the sequence (1,0,1,0,...), introduced in Example 1.21. In this 211\ncase,thesubsequence(a ) = (1,1,1,1,...)convergesto1,whereasthesubsequence\n2j\u22121\n(a ) = (0,0,0,0,...) converges to 0. Consequently the sequence (a ) cannot be\n2j k\nconvergent.\nTogether with the other results of this section, Proposition 5.7 also proves to be\nquite helpful in determining the limits of certain sequences.\nExample 5.8 For a fixed number b, with 0 \u2264 b < 1, consider the sequence (bk) =\n(b,b2,b3,b4,...). Observe that this sequence is non-increasing and bounded below by\n0. Hence the Monotone Convergence Theorem dictates that (bk) converges to a limit\nx. Proposition 5.7 shows that the subsequence (b2k) = (b2,b4,b6,b8,...) converges to\nthe same limit x. Therefore the Algebraic Limit Theorem dictates that\n(cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:16) (cid:17)\nx2 = lim bk lim bk = lim b2k = x.\nk\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e\nTherefore x must either be 0 or 1. Since every term in the sequence (bk) is less\nthan or equal to b, which is less than 1, the Order Limit Theorem guarantees that\n(bk) converges to 0. It follows from Exercise 1.29 that the same result holds when\n\u22121 < b < 0.\nRemark. In situations where one is employing an argument similar to that from Ex-\nample 5.8, it is essential to verify that the sequence (a ) converges. As a caution-\nk\nary example, consider the divergent sequence (a ) = (1,0,1,0,...). Observe that\nk\n(a ) = (0,1,0,1,...). If we assume that (a ) converges to x, then (a ) also\nk+1 k k+1\nconverges to x. Since a a = 0 for all k in N, it would follow that\nk k+1\n(cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:16) (cid:17)\nx2 = lim a lim a = lim a a = 0,\nk k+1 k k+1\nk\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e\nfrom which we would erroneously conclude that the sequence converges to 0. 212\nExample 5.9 Let c be a fixed positive number. Define the sequence (a ) recursively,\nk\nwith a = c and\n1\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 c\na = a + (5.1)\nk+1 k\n2 a\nk\n\u221a\nfor k \u2265 1. We claim that this sequence converges to c.\nFirst of all, note that\n(cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:19)2\n1 c\na2 \u2212c = a + \u2212c\nk+1 2 k a\nk\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1\n= a2 +2c+ \u2212c\n4 k a2\nk\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1\n= a2 \u22122c+\n4 k a2\nk\n(cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:19)2\n1 c\n= a \u2212 \u2265 0\nk\n2 a\nk\nfor k \u2265 1, which means that a2 \u2265 c whenever k \u2265 2. Since a is positive and every\nk 1\nsubsequent term in the sequence is obtained by adding, multiplying, and dividing by\npositive numbers, each a must also be positive.\nk\nObserve that\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 c\na \u2212a = a \u2212 a +\nk k+1 k k\n2 a\nk\n1 c a2 \u2212c\n= a \u2212 = k ,\nk\n2 2a 2a\nk k\nwhich is non-negative for each k \u2265 2, since a is positive and a2 \u2265 c. In other words,\nk k\nthe sequence (a ) is non-increasing (at least for k \u2265 2). Since the sequence is bounded\nk\nbelow by 0, the Monotone Convergence Theorem guarantees that (a ) converges to\nk\nsomenumberx. Proposition5.7dictatesthatthesubsequence(a ) = (a ,a ,a ,...)\nk+1 2 3 4\nalso converges to x. Applying the Algebraic Limit Theorem to equation (5.1), we see\nthat\n1 (cid:16) c(cid:17)\nx = x+ ,\n2 x 213\n\u221a \u221a\nand hence x2 = c. Therefore x is either equal to c or \u2212 c. Since each term in the\n\u221a\nsequence is positive, the Order Limit Theorem shows that x cannot be \u2212 c, so we\n\u221a\nconclude that (a ) converges to c.\nk\nProposition 5.7 shows that the convergence of a sequence guarantees the conver-\ngenceofanysubsequence. Ontheotherhand,theconvergenceofcertainsubsequences\nwill also guarantee the convergence of a sequence. While we could prove a much more\ngeneral result, the following lemma will be extremely useful throughout the rest of\nthis chapter.\nLemma5.10 Forasequence(a ),ifthesubsequences(a )and(a )bothconverge\nk 2j\u22121 2j\nto the same number x, then (a ) also converges to x.\nk\nProof. Suppose that both (a ) = (a ,a ,a ,...) and (a ) = (a ,a ,a ,...) con-\n2j\u22121 1 3 5 2j 2 4 6\nverge to x. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since (a ) converges to x, there\n2j\u22121\nis a natural number J such that |a \u2212x| < \u03b5 whenever j \u2265 J . Likewise, there is a\n1 2j\u22121 1\nnaturalnumberJ suchthat|a \u2212x| < \u03b5wheneverj \u2265 J . LetK = max{2J \u22121,2J }\n2 2j 2 1 2\nand suppose that k \u2265 K. If k = 2j\u22121 is odd, then j = (k+1)/2 \u2265 (K +1)/2 \u2265 J ,\n1\nand hence\n|a \u2212L| = |a \u2212x| < \u03b5.\nk 2j\u22121\nIf k = 2j is even, then j = k/2 \u2265 K/2 \u2265 J , and hence\n2\n|a \u2212L| = |a \u2212x| < \u03b5.\nk 2j\nIn either case, |a \u2212 x| < \u03b5 whenever k \u2265 K, so we conclude that (a ) converges\nk k\nto x 214\nWe already know that every convergent sequence must be bounded, but not every\nbounded sequence is convergent. It turns out that boundedness does imply conver-\ngence, but only for a subsequence of the original sequence.\nTheorem 5.11 (Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem) Any bounded sequence must have\na convergent subsequence.\nProof. ThestandardproofofthisresultissimilartothatoftheHeine\u2013BorelProperty.\nLet us consider a sequence (a ), viewing a and a as distinct terms whenever j (cid:54)= k,\nk j k\neven if a = a . Suppose there is a positive number M such that each term a belongs\nj k k\nto the interval [\u2212M,M]. At least one of the subintervals [\u2212M,0] and [0,M] must\ncontain infinitely many terms of (a ). Choose such a subinterval and label it I . Take\nk 1\na to be any element of (a ) that belongs to I . Likewise, divide I into two compact\nk1 k 1 1\nsubintervals of equal length. At least one of these subintervals, which we label I ,\n2\nmust contain infinitely many terms of (a ). Take a to be any element of (a ) that\nk k2 k\nbelongs to I , with the additional stipulation that k > k .\n2 2 1\nIn this manner, one can construct a collection of intervals\n[\u2212M,M] \u2283 I \u2283 I \u2283 I \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,\n1 2 3\nwhere each interval contains infinitely many terms of (a ) and the length of I is\nk j\nM/2j\u22121. Moreover, we define the subsequence (a ) by taking a to be a term\nkj kj\nbelonging to the interval I , with k > k for j \u2265 2. The Nested Interval Property\nj j j\u22121\n(cid:84)\u221e\nguarantees that there must be an element x belonging to I . Since a and x\nk=1 k kj\nboth belong to the subinterval I , we see that\nj\nM\n|a \u2212x| \u2264\nkj 2j\u22121 215\nfor every j in N. Consequently the subsequence (a ) converges to x (see Exercise\nkj\n5.4).\n5.2 Properties of Series\nRecall from Section 1.5 that the standard method for describing the behavior of\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\na series a is to consider the sequence (s ) of partial sums, where\nk m\nk=1\ns = a +a +...+a .\nm 1 2 m\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nIf the sequence (s ) converges to a value L, we say the series a converges to L.\nm k\nk=1\nIf the sequence (s ) diverges, the series diverges. At this point, we are in a position\nm\nto expand on the two examples we initially considered in Chapter 1.\nExample 5.12 Example 1.29 introduced the series\n\u221e\n(cid:88) 1 1 1 1\n= + + +...,\n2k 2 4 8\nk=1\nwhich converges to 1. More generally, any series of the form\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nark\u22121 = a+ar+ar2 +..., (5.2)\nk=1\nfor real numbers a and r, with a (cid:54)= 0, is known as a geometric series. As in Example\n1.29, we can find a simple expression for the partial sum s . Note that\nm\ns = a+ar+ar2 +...+arm\u22121,\nm\nso that\nrs = ar+ar2 +ar3 +...+arm.\nm 216\nSubtracting the second expression from the first, we see that\ns \u2212rs = a\u2212arm,\nm m\nand hence\ns (1\u2212r) = a(1\u2212rm).\nm\nAs long as r (cid:54)= 1, we obtain\na(1\u2212rm)\ns = .\nm\n1\u2212r\nTake \u22121 < r < 1. The Algebraic Limit Theorem, along with Example 5.8, shows\nthat the sequence (s ) converges to a/(1\u2212r). In other words, a series defined as in\nm\n(5.2) converges to a/(1\u2212r) whenever \u22121 < r < 1. It is not difficult to show that such\na series diverges for other values of r. The situation when r = \u22121 is still somewhat\ninteresting, though, as we shall see in Section 5.5.\nExample 5.13 Example 1.30 demonstrated that the harmonic series\n\u221e\n(cid:88) 1 1 1\n= 1+ + +...\nk 2 3\nk=1\ndiverges. We will broaden our perspective to examine any series of the form\n\u221e\n(cid:88) 1 1 1\n= 1+ + +...\nkp 2p 3p\nk=1\nfor a rational number p. (The same results will hold when p is irrational, although we\nhave not formally defined what it means to raise a number to an irrational power.)\nFirst of all, consider the case where 0 < p < 1. For any natural number m, define\nthe function f : [1,m+1] \u2192 R by the rule\nm\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f41/kp, k \u2264 t < k +1\n\uf8f2\nf (t) =\nm\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, t = m+1 217\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m. Corollary 4.32 shows that f is Riemann integrable, with\nm\n(cid:90) m+1 (cid:88)m 1\nf = ,\nm kp\n1\nk=1\nwhich is simply the partial sum s of the series we are investigating. Defining\nm\ng : [1,m + 1] \u2192 R by the rule g (t) = 1/tp, we see that g (t) \u2264 f (t) for all t\nm m m m\nin [1,m+1]. Consequently Proposition 4.16, along with Theorem 4.36, shows that\n(m+1)1\u2212p \u22121 (cid:90) m+1 (cid:90) m+1\n= g \u2264 f = s (5.3)\nm m m\n1\u2212p\n1 1\nfor any m in N. Since 1 \u2212 p is positive, (5.3) shows that the sequence (s ) is un-\nm\nbounded. Therefore the sequence of partial sums diverges, which is equivalent to\nsaying that the series diverges.\nNow take p > 1. In this situation, we define h : [0,m] \u2192 R by the rule\nm\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 \uf8f41/kp, k \u22121 \u2264 t < k\n\uf8f2\nh (t) =\nm\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f30, t = m\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m. As above, Corollary 4.32 shows that\n(cid:90) m (cid:88)m 1\nh = = s .\nm kp m\n0\nk=1\nDefine the function i : [0,m] \u2192 R by the rule\nm\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f41, 0 \u2264 t < 1\n\uf8f2\ni (t) = .\nm\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f31/tp, 1 < t \u2264 m\nNote that h (t) \u2264 i (t) for all t in [0,m]. Theorem 4.29 shows that\nm m\n(cid:90) m (cid:90) 1 (cid:90) m m1\u2212p \u22121 p\u2212m1\u2212p\ni = i + i = 1+ = .\nm m m\n1\u2212p p\u22121\n0 0 1 218\nSince p\u22121 is positive, we see that\n(cid:90) m (cid:90) m p\u2212m1\u2212p p\ns = h \u2264 i = < .\nm m m\np\u22121 p\u22121\n0 0\nIn other words, the sequence (s ) is bounded above. Since\nm\n1\ns \u2212s = > 0,\nm+1 m (m+1)p\nthe sequence (s ) is also increasing. Hence the Monotone Convergence Theorem\nm\ndictates that the sequence of partial sums, and thus the series itself, is convergent.\nThe argument we have just employed is essentially an application of the integral\ntest, which many readers will have encountered while studying calculus. This tech-\nnique does not provide the exact value to which the series converges when p > 1,\nalthough that value must lie between 1 and p/(p\u22121).\nWhile not an especially interesting case in its own right, Corollary 5.15 will show\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nthat 1/kp diverges whenever p \u2264 0.\nk=1\nThe preceding examples made use of the Algebraic Limit Theorem and the Mono-\ntone Convergence Theorem, as well as a variety of other results relating to sequences.\nIn principle, any fact pertaining to sequences can be adapted to series. For example,\nthe Cauchy Criterion (Theorem 1.27) can be interpreted in the following manner.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nTheorem 5.14 (Cauchy Criterion for Series) A series a converges if and only\nk\nk=1\nif, for every positive number \u03b5, there is a natural number K such that\n|a +a +...+a | < \u03b5 (5.4)\nj+1 j+2 k\nwhenever k > j \u2265 K.\nProof. The Cauchy Criterion dictates that the sequence (s ) converges if and only if\nm\nit is Cauchy; that is, for any positive number \u03b5, there is a natural number K such that 219\n|s \u2212s | < \u03b5 whenever j \u2265 K and k \u2265 K. If j = k, this condition is automatically\nj k\nsatisfied. Hence, without loss of generality, we can take j < k. Observe that\n|s \u2212s | = |(a +a +...+a )\u2212(a +a +...+a )| = |a +a +...+a |,\nj k 1 2 j 1 2 k j+1 j+2 k\nso the condition |s \u2212s | < \u03b5 can be restated as in (5.4).\nj k\nTheorem5.14hasmanyimportantconsequences, thefirstofwhichisoftenapplied\nas a test for divergence.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nCorollary 5.15 If a series a is convergent, the sequence of terms (a ) must\nk k\nk=1\nconverge to 0.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nProof.

Taking k = j +1, we see that\n|a \u22120| = |a | < \u03b5\nk k\nwhenever k \u2265 K +1. Consequently the sequence (a ) converges to 0.\nk\nFor example, a series such as\n\u221e\n(cid:88) k\nk +1\nk=1\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nmust diverge, because the sequence k/(k + 1) converges to 1.

For example,\n(cid:88)\u221e (\u22121)k\u22121 1 1 1\n= 1\u2212 + \u2212 +...\nk2 4 9 16\nk=1\nis absolutely convergent, whereas\n(cid:88)\u221e (\u22121)k\u22121 1 1 1\n= 1\u2212 + \u2212 +...,\nk 2 3 4\nk=1\nis conditionally convergent. (Note that a series consisting of non-negative terms is\nabsolutely convergent if and only if it is convergent.) We will explore the differences\nbetween these two types of convergence in Section 5.4.\n5.3 The Alternating Harmonic Series\nAt this point, we will take a brief digression to consider a particularly interesting\nseries:\n(cid:88)\u221e (\u22121)k\u22121 1 1 1\n= 1\u2212 + \u2212 +...,\nk 2 3 4\nk=1\nknown as the alternating harmonic series. We have already demonstrated that this\nseries converges. What is perhaps more interesting is that we can determine the exact\nvalue to which it converges. The technique we will employ is somewhat circuitous,\nand is not readily generalizable to other examples.\nFor any natural number k, define\n1 1 1\n\u03b3 = 1+ + +...+ \u2212log(k +1).\nk\n2 3 k 224\nOur first objective is to show that the sequence (\u03b3 ) converges. Observe that\nk\n1\n\u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 = \u2212log(k +2)+log(k +1)\nk+1 k\nk +1\n1 (cid:90) k+2 (cid:90) k+1\n= \u2212 f + f\nk +1\n1 1\n1 (cid:90) k+2\n= \u2212 f,\nk +1\nk+1\nwhere f(u) = 1/u. Proposition 4.17 shows that\n1 (cid:90) k+2 1\n\u2264 f \u2264 ,\nk +2 k +1\nk+1\nso we conclude that\n1 1\n0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 \u2264 \u2212\nk+1 k\nk +1 k +2\nfor all k in N. Consequently the sequence (\u03b3 ) is non-decreasing. Moreover,\nk\n\u03b3 = \u03b3 +(\u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 )+(\u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 )+...+(\u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 )\nk 1 2 1 3 2 k k\u22121\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\u2264 \u03b3 + \u2212 + \u2212 +...+ \u2212\n1\n2 3 3 4 k k +1\n1 1\n= \u03b3 + \u2212\n1\n2 k +1\n1 3\n< \u03b3 + = \u2212log2\n1\n2 2\nfor all k in N, so the sequence (\u03b3 ) is bounded above. Therefore (\u03b3 ) converges, to a\nk k\nnumber we shall call \u03b3.\nThenumber\u03b3 wehavejustintroduced,whosevalueisapproximately0.5772156649,\nis known either as Euler\u2019s constant or the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. While it is not\nrelevant to our current discussion, the question of whether \u03b3 is rational or irrational\nremains beguilingly unresolved.\nWe will now use the number \u03b3 to determine the value to which the alternating\nharmonic series converges. Let (s ) denote the sequence of partial sums for this\nm 225\nseries, which we already know to be convergent. For any natural number j, observe\nthat\n1 1 1 1 1\ns = 1\u2212 + \u2212 +...+ \u2212\n2j\n2 3 4 2j \u22121 2j\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n= 1+ + + +...+ + \u22122 + ...+\n2 3 4 2j \u22121 2j 2 4 2j\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n= 1+ + +...+ \u2212 1+ + ...+\n2 3 2j 2 3 j\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\n= \u03b3 +log(2j +1) \u2212 \u03b3 +log(j +1)\n2j j\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n2j +1\n= \u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 +log .\n2j j\nj +1\nProposition 5.7 shows that (\u03b3 ) converges to \u03b3. Applying Proposition 2.13 and the\n2j\nAlgebraic Limit Theorem, we see that (s ) converges to\n2j\n\u03b3 \u2212\u03b3 +log2 = log2.\nSince (s ) must converge to the same limit as (s ), we conclude that (s ) converges\n2j m m\nto log2. In other words, the alternating harmonic series converges to the value log2.\n5.4 Absolute and Conditional Convergence\nWe begin by establishing a test that is commonly used to determine absolute\nconvergence.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nTheorem 5.19 (Ratio Test) Suppose a is a series consisting of nonzero terms,\nk\nk=1\nfor which\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nr = lim (cid:12) (cid:12)\nk\u2192\u221e(cid:12) a (cid:12)\nk\nexists. If 0 \u2264 r < 1, the series converges absolutely. If r > 1, the series diverges. 226\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that 0 \u2264 r < 1. Since (1 \u2212 r)/2 is a positive number,\nthere is a natural number K such that\n(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12) (cid:12) 1\u2212r\n(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)\u2212r(cid:12) < ,\n(cid:12)(cid:12) a (cid:12) (cid:12) 2\nk\nand hence\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12) 1\u2212r 1+r\n(cid:12) (cid:12) < r+ = ,\n(cid:12) a (cid:12) 2 2\nk\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Let r = (1+r)/2, which is also less than 1. Note that\n1\n|a | < |a |r < |a |r2 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < |a |rk\nK+k K+k\u22121 1 K+k\u22122 1 K 1\nfor any natural number k. Since the geometric series\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\n|a |rk\u22121 = |a |+|a |r +|a |r2 +|a |r3 +...\nK 1 K K 1 K 1 K 1\nk=1\nconverges, the Comparison Test dictates that\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\n|a | = |a |+|a |+|a |+|a |+...\nK+k\u22121 K K+1 K+2 K+3\nk=1\nconverges as well. Thus the result of Exercise 5.13, applied K \u22121 times, shows that\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\n|a | converges. In other words, the series a converges absolutely.\nk k\nk=1 k=1\nSuppose then that r > 1. Since\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)1/a k+1(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) 1\nlim (cid:12) (cid:12) = lim (cid:12) (cid:12) = < 1,\nk\u2192\u221e(cid:12) 1/a (cid:12) k\u2192\u221e(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12) r\nk\nthe series\n\u221e\n(cid:88) 1\na\nk\nk=1\nis absolutely convergent. Hence the sequence (1/a ) converges to 0, so (a ) must be\nk k\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\ndivergent (see Exercise 5.2). Thus Corollary 5.15 dictates that a diverges.\nk\nk=1 227\nThe Ratio Test is inconclusive when r = 1, in that no possible outcome can\nbe excluded (see Exercise 5.14). There are numerous extensions of the Ratio Test,\nwhich can be used to determine the behavior of certain series for which r = 1. The\nfollowing test, while fairly well known, should probably be given more attention than\nit typically receives.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nTheorem 5.20 (Raabe\u2019sTest) Suppose a isaseriesconsistingofnonzeroterms,\nk\nk=1\nfor which\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\np = lim k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nexists. If p > 1, the series converges absolutely. If 0 \u2264 p < 1, the series is either\nconditionally convergent or divergent. If p < 0, the series diverges.\nProof. Suppose, first of all, that p > 1. Since (p\u22121)/2 is a positive number, there is\na natural number K such that\n(cid:12) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) p\u22121\n(cid:12)k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 \u2212p(cid:12) < ,\n(cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12) 2\nk+1\nand hence\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12) p\u22121 p+1\nk (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 > p\u2212 = ,\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) 2 2\nk+1\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Let p = (p+1)/2, which is also greater than 1. Observe that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\nk(cid:12) (cid:12) > p +k\n1\n(cid:12)a (cid:12)\nk+1\nand thus\nk|a | > (p +k)|a |\nk 1 k+1\nfor k \u2265 K, from which we see that\nk|a |\u2212(k +1)|a | > (p \u22121)|a |. (5.5)\nk k+1 1 k+1 228\nSince p \u22121 is positive, it follows that\n1\nk|a | > (k +1)|a |\nk k+1\nfor k \u2265 K. Since every term k|a | is positive, the Monotone Convergence Theorem\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nguarantees that the sequence k|a | converges to some limit x. Consider the series\nk\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\nb = k|a |\u2212(k +1)|a | .\nk k k+1\nk=1 k=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nNote that the mth partial sum of b is equal to\nk\nk=1\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\n|a |\u22122|a | + |2a |\u22123|a | + |3a |\u22124|a | +...+ m|a |\u2212(m+1)|a |\n1 2 2 3 3 4 m m\n= |a |\u2212(m+1)|a |,\n1 m+1\nso the series converges to |a |\u2212x. Therefore the Comparison Test, along with (5.5),\n1\nshows that\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\n(p \u22121)|a |\n1 k+1\nk=1\nis convergent, as is\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) 1 (cid:88)\n|a | = (p \u22121)|a |.\nk+1 1 k+1\np \u22121\n1\nk=1 k=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nConsequently the series a converges absolutely.\nk\nk=1\nNow suppose that 0 \u2264 p < 1. Since (1 \u2212 p)/2 is a positive number, there is a\nnatural number K such that\n(cid:12) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) 1\u2212p\n(cid:12)k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 \u2212p(cid:12) < ,\n(cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12) 2\nk+1\nand hence\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12) 1\u2212p 1+p\nk (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 < p+ = ,\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) 2 2\nk+1 229\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Therefore\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12) 1+p p\u22121\nk(cid:12) (cid:12)\u2212(k +1) < \u22121 = < 0\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) 2 2\nk+1\nfor k \u2265 K. Consequently\nk|a | < (k +1)|a |\nk k+1\nfor k \u2265 K, which means that K|a | \u2264 k|a | whenever k \u2265 K. Taking M = K|a |,\nK k K\nwe see that\nM\n\u2264 |a |\nk\nk\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Thus |a | is divergent, so the series a is either conditionally\nk k\nk=1 k=1\nconvergent or divergent.\nFinally, suppose that p < 0. Since \u2212p is a positive number, there is a natural\nnumber K such that\n(cid:12) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 \u2212p(cid:12) < \u2212p,\n(cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12)\nk+1\nand hence\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\nk (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 < p\u2212p = 0,\n(cid:12)a (cid:12)\nk+1\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Consequently\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 < 0\n(cid:12)a (cid:12)\nk+1\nfor k \u2265 K, which means that |a | < |a | whenever k \u2265 K. Therefore the sequence\nk k+1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\n(a ) does not converge to 0, so the series a is divergent.\nk k\nk=1\nExercise 5.5 shows that the quantity\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\np = lim k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12) 230\nfrom Raabe\u2019s Test cannot exist unless\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\nlim (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 = 0.\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nTherefore the quantity\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nr = lim (cid:12) (cid:12)\nk\u2192\u221e(cid:12) a (cid:12)\nk\nfrom the Ratio Test must exist and be equal to 1. In other words, Raabe\u2019s Test\npresupposes the inconclusiveness of the Ratio Test.\nAs in the case of the Ratio Test, Raabe\u2019s Test yields no information when p = 1.\nFor 0 \u2264 p < 1, there are examples for which the series converges conditionally and\nexamples for which the series diverges. (See Exercise 5.17.) In general, it can be\ndifficult to determine the behavior of a series when 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1, although the following\nresults are rather helpful.\nProposition 5.21 Suppose (a ) is a sequence consisting of nonzero numbers, for\nk\nwhich\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\np = lim k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nexists. If p > 0, the sequence (a ) converges to 0.\nk\nProof. Since p/2 is a positive number, there is a natural number K such that\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) p\n(cid:12)k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 \u2212p(cid:12) < ,\n(cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12) 2\nk+1\nand hence\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12) p p\nk (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 > p\u2212 = > 0, (5.6)\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) 2 2\nk+1\nwhenever k \u2265 K . Consequently\n1\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 > 0\n(cid:12)a (cid:12)\nk+1 231\nfor k \u2265 K , so |a | > |a | whenever k \u2265 K . The Monotone Convergence Theorem\n1 k k+1 1\nguarantees that (|a |) converges to a non-negative number x. We simply need to show\nk\nthat x is equal to 0.\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that x > 0. Since x/2 is positive, there is\na natural number K such that\n2\n(cid:12) (cid:12) x\n(cid:12)|a |\u2212x(cid:12) < ,\nk\n2\nand hence\nx x\n|a | > x\u2212 = , (5.7)\nk\n2 2\nwhenever k \u2265 K . Let K = max{K ,K \u2212 1}. Combining (5.6) and (5.7), we see\n2 1 2\nthat\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n2k(|a k|\u2212|a k+1|) |a k|\u2212|a k+1| (cid:12) a k (cid:12) p\n> k = k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 >\nx |a | (cid:12)a (cid:12) 2\nk+1 k+1\nwhen k \u2265 K, which means that\npx\n|a |\u2212|a | > .\nk k+1\n4k\nIt follows that\n|a |\u2212|a | = (|a |\u2212|a |)+(|a |\u2212|a |)+(|a |\u2212|a |)+...+(|a |\u2212|a |)\nj k j j+1 j+1 j+2 j+2 j+3 k\u22121 k\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\npx 1 1 1 1\n> + + +...+\n4 j j +1 j +2 k \u22121\nwhenever k > j \u2265 K. Thus we have obtained a contradiction, since (|a |) is a\nk\nCauchy sequence but the sequence of partial sums corresponding to the harmonic\nseries diverges. Hence we conclude that x must be 0.\nCorollary 5.22 (Raabe\u2019s Alternating Series Test) Suppose (a ) is a sequence con-\nk\nsisting of positive numbers, for which\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\na\nk\np = lim k \u22121\nk\u2192\u221e a k+1 232\nexists.

In addition to showing that (a ) converges to 0, the proof of Proposition 5.21\nk\nshows that there is a natural number K such that a > a for k \u2265 K . Hence the\n1 k k+1 1\nAlternatingSeriesTestguaranteesthatbothoftheseriesstatedaboveareconvergent.\nIf 0 < p < 1, Raabe\u2019s Test shows that both series must, in fact, be conditionally\nconvergent.\nIt is helpful to view both the Ratio Test and Raabe\u2019s Test as constituting a sort\nof implicit comparison. For a geometric series\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\na = ark\u22121\nk\nk=1 k=1\nwith r > 0, it is not difficult to see that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nlim (cid:12) (cid:12) = r.\nk\u2192\u221e(cid:12) a (cid:12)\nk\nSimilarly, if\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88) 1\na = ,\nk kp\nk=1 k=1\none can show (see Exercise 5.15) that\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\nlim k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 = p.\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12) 233\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nIn other words, the Ratio Test tells us when a series |a | \u201cbehaves like\u201d a geo-\nk\nk=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nmetric series with a certain value of r. Likewise, Raabe\u2019s Test indicates when |a |\nk\nk=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\n\u201cbehaves like\u201d 1/kp for a particular p. The only exceptions are the borderline\nk=1\ncases: r = 1 for the Ratio Test and p = 0 and p = 1 for Raabe\u2019s Test.\nThe following observation is consistent with this interpretation of Raabe\u2019s Test.\nProposition 5.23 Suppose (a ) and (b ) are sequences consisting of nonzero num-\nk k\nbers, for which\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12)\np = lim k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nand\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) b k (cid:12)\nq = lim k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)b k+1(cid:12)\nboth exist.

Furthermore, for any real number n, the expression\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12)n (cid:19)\nlim k (cid:12) (cid:12) \u22121\nk\u2192\u221e (cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nexists and is equal to np.\nProof. First of all, note that\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a kb k (cid:12) |a kb k+1| |a kb k|\u2212|a kb k+1|\nk (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 = k + \u22121\n(cid:12)a b (cid:12) |a b | |a b |\nk+1 k+1 k+1 k+1 k+1 k+1\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) |b k|\u2212|b k+1|\n= k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121+(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) |b |\nk+1 k+1 k+1\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19)\n(cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) b k (cid:12)\n= k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 +(cid:12) (cid:12)k (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 .\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12)b (cid:12)\nk+1 k+1 k+1 234\nSince\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a k+1(cid:12)\nlim (cid:12) (cid:12) = 1,\nk\u2192\u221e(cid:12) a (cid:12)\nk\nour first assertion follows from the Algebraic Limit Theorem.\nTo prove the second assertion, consider the continuous function\n\uf8f1\ntn \u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 , t (cid:54)= 1\n\uf8f2\nt\u22121\ng(t) = .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3n, t = 1\nObserve that\n(cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12)n (cid:19) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:19) (cid:18)(cid:12) (cid:12) a k (cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:19)\nk (cid:12) (cid:12) \u22121 = n (cid:12) (cid:12)\u22121 g (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12) (cid:12)a (cid:12)\nk+1 k+1 k+1\nfor all n. Since |a /a | is converging to 1, the expression above converges to the\nk k+1\nproduct of p and n.\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nIn other words, if a and b correspond to the values p and q with respect\nk k\nk=1 k=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nto Raabe\u2019s Test, the series a b corresponds to the value p+q. Likewise, whenever\nk k\nk=1\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nit is defined, the series an corresponds to the value np. (In particular, 1/a\nk k\nk=1 k=1\ncorresponds to the value \u2212p.) Besides making sense conceptually, these observations\ncan be quite useful from a computational perspective.\nThe distinction between absolute and conditional convergence is far more than a\ntechnical nicety. The following example, presented somewhat informally, illustrates\none of the fundamental properties of a conditionally convergent series.\nExample 5.24 We have already shown that the alternating harmonic series\n(cid:88)\u221e (\u22121)k\u22121 1 1 1\n= 1\u2212 + \u2212 +...\nk 2 3 4\nk=1 235\nconverges conditionally to the value log2. Consider the same series, but with the\nterms in a different order:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1\u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 +.... (5.8)\n2 4 3 6 8 5 10 12\nIn other words, the series has been rearranged into blocks of three terms, where the\njth block has the form\n1 1 1\n\u2212 \u2212 .\n2j \u22121 4j \u22122 4j\nCombining the positive term with the first of the two negative terms, we obtain\n1 1\n\u2212 .\n4j \u22122 4j\nHence (5.8) can be rewritten\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212 +... = 1\u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212 +... , (5.9)\n2 4 6 8 10 12 2 2 3 4 5 6\nwhich converges to (1/2)log2. While this result may seem like a paradox or a sleight\nofhand,theconclusioniscompletelycorrect. Rearrangingthetermsinthealternating\nharmonic series can, in fact, affect the value to which the series converges.\nBefore proceeding further, we will pause to address a slight imprecision in the\nargument above. If (s ) denotes the sequence of partial sums for (5.8), expression\nm\n(5.9) represents the series with partial sums\n(s ,s ,s ,s ,s ,s ,...).\n2 3 5 6 8 9\nIt is actually this subsequence of (s ) that we have shown converges to (1/2)log2.\nm\nNote that each of the missing terms s can be rewritten\n3j\u22122\n1\ns + ,\n3j\u22121\n4j \u22122\nso it is not difficult to prove that the entire sequence (s ) converges to (1/2)log2.\nm 236\nThe preceding example is entirely typical of the situation for conditionally conver-\ngent series. Not only can such a series be reordered to converge to a different value,\nbut it can be reordered to converge to any value. Although we will not provide a for-\nmal proof of this result, we will give a brief explanation as to why this phenomenon\noccurs.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nConsider a series a . Adapting notation introduced in Section 4.5, we define\nk\nk=1\na+ = max{a ,0}\nk k\nand\na\u2212 = max{\u2212a ,0}.\nk k\nObserve that a = a+ \u2212a\u2212 and |a | = a+ +a\u2212 for all k in N, from which it follows\nk k k k k k\nthat\n|a |+a\na+ = k k (5.10)\nk 2\nand\n|a |\u2212a\na\u2212 = k k . (5.11)\nk 2\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nIf a is absolutely convergent, equations (5.10) and (5.11) show that both of the\nk\nk=1\n\u221e \u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88)\nseries a+ and a\u2212 are convergent. On the other hand, if a is conditionally\nk k k\nk=1 k=1 k=1\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nconvergent, both a+ and a\u2212 must be divergent; moreover, since the terms a+\nk k k\nk=1 k=1\nand a\u2212 are non-negative, the sequences of partial sums corresponding to each of these\nk\nseries must be unbounded.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nSuppose we would like to rearrange a conditionally convergent series a to\nk\nk=1\nconverge to a particular value L. (To avoid notational difficulty, we will assume that 237\nall the terms a are nonzero.) Beginning with the first nonzero term a+, add consec-\nk k\nutive nonzero terms from the sequence (a+) until the value becomes greater than L;\nk\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nwe know this objective is attainable because the series a+ diverges. Decrease this\nk\nk=1\nvalue by subtracting consecutive nonzero terms belonging to (a\u2212), starting with the\nk\nfirst nonzero term a\u2212, until the total is less than L. Repeat this process indefinitely,\nk\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nmaking sure not to skip over any nonzero terms a+ or a\u2212. Since the series a con-\nk k k\nk=1\nverges, the sequences (a+) and (a\u2212) must both be converging to 0. Consequently the\nk k\namount by which this procedure overshoots or undershoots L can be made less than\nany positive \u03b5 by taking k sufficiently large. Hence the resulting series, consisting of\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nterms of the form a+ and \u2212a\u2212, is a rearrangement of the original series a that\nk k k\nk=1\nconverges to L.\nThe opposite situation occurs with absolutely convergent series, as we shall now\ndemonstrate. Beforestatingtherelevant result, weshouldbeabitmore preciseabout\nwhat we mean by a rearrangement of a series.\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nDefinition 5.25 A series b is a rearrangement of a if there is a bijection\nk k\nk=1 k=1\nf: N \u2192 N such that b = a for all k in N.\nk f(k)\nTheorem 5.26 If a series is absolutely convergent, any rearrangement will converge\nto the same value.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nProof. Suppose that a converges absolutely to a value L and consider a rear-\nk\nk=1\n\u221e \u221e\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nrangement b = a . Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. First of all,\nk f(k)\nk=1 k=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nsince |a | converges, Theorem 5.14 dictates that there is a natural number K\nk 1\nk=1\nsuch that\n\u03b5\n|a |+|a |+...+|a | <\nj+1 j+2 k\n2 238\nwhenever k > j \u2265 K .\n1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nLet (s ) denote the sequence of partial sums for the original series a and (t )\nm k n\nk=1\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\ndenote the sequence of partial sums for the rearranged series b . By assumption,\nk\nk=1\nthere is a natural number K such that\n2\n\u03b5\n|s \u2212L| <\nm\n2\nwhenever m \u2265 K . Take K = max{K ,K } and consider the partial sum\n2 1 2\ns = a +a +...+a .\nK 1 2 K\nDefine N = max{f\u22121(k) : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 K}, so that every term in the list (a ,a ,...,a )\n1 2 K\nappears in the list (b ,b ,...,b ) whenever n \u2265 N. Therefore\n1 2 n\n|t \u2212s | \u2264 |a |+|a |+...+|a | (5.12)\nn K K+1 K+2 j\nwhenever n \u2265 N, where j = max{f(k) : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n}. Since N must be greater than\nor equal to K, we conclude that (5.12) must be less than \u03b5/2. Consequently\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n|t \u2212L| = (cid:12)(t \u2212s )+(s \u2212L)(cid:12)\nn n K K\n\u2264 |t \u2212s |+|s \u2212L|\nn K K\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n< + = \u03b5\n2 2\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nwhenever n \u2265 N. In other words, the rearranged series b also converges to L.\nk\nk=1\n5.5 Ces`aro Convergence\nWhile the standard definitions for convergence of a sequence or series are quite\nversatile, there are circumstances in which it is helpful to broaden our perspective. 239\nAs with many other concepts in mathematics, there are alternative definitions that\ncan profitably be used to extend our notion of convergence.\nDefinition 5.27 For a sequence (a ), define the Ces`aro mean C(a ) by the rule\nk k\na +a +...+a\n1 2 k\nC(a ) = .\nk\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nIfthesequence C(a ) convergestoanumberx,wesaythat(a )isCes`aro convergent\nk k\nto x.\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nProposition 5.28 If (a ) converges to a number x, the sequence C(a ) also con-\nk k\nverges to x.\nProof. Let \u03b5 be an arbitrary positive number. Since (a ) converges to x, there is a\nk\nnatural number K such that\n\u03b5\n|a \u2212x| <\nk\n2\nwhenever k \u2265 K. Observe that\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)a 1 +a 2 +...+a k kx(cid:12)\n(cid:12)C(a )\u2212x(cid:12) = (cid:12) \u2212 (cid:12)\nk\n(cid:12) k k (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(a \u2212x)+(a \u2212x)+...+(a \u2212x)(cid:12)\n1 2 k\n= (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) k (cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)(a \u2212x)+...+(a \u2212x)(cid:12) (cid:12)(a \u2212x)+...+(a \u2212x)(cid:12)\n1 K\u22121 K k\n\u2264 (cid:12) (cid:12)+(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) k (cid:12) (cid:12) k (cid:12)\n|(a \u2212x)+...+(a \u2212x)| |a \u2212x| |a \u2212x|\n1 K\u22121 K k\n\u2264 + +...+\nk k k\nfor k \u2265 K. Let M = |(a \u2212x)+...+(a \u2212x)|, which is just a fixed finite value. Let\n1 K\u22121\nK be a natural number greater than 2M/\u03b5, so that M/k < \u03b5/2 whenever k \u2265 K .\n1 1 240\nTaking K = max{K,K }, we see that\n2 1\n(cid:12) (cid:12) M |a K \u2212x| |a K+1 \u2212x| |a k \u2212x|\n(cid:12)C(a )\u2212x(cid:12) \u2264 + + +...+\nk\nk k k k\n\u03b5 \u03b5/2 \u03b5/2 \u03b5/2\n< + + +...+\n2 k k k\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nk\u2212K+1times\n\u03b5 \u03b5(k \u2212K +1) \u03b5 \u03b5\n= + \u2264 + = \u03b5.\n2 2k 2 2\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nwhenever k \u2265 K . Consequently the sequence C(a ) also converges to x.\n2 k\nIn other words, any sequence that is convergent to a number x is also Cesa`ro\nconvergent to x. On the other hand, many sequences that are not convergent in the\nstandard sense behave differently with respect to Cesa`ro convergence.\nExample 5.29 Let a = 1/2+(\u22121)k\u22121(1/2), so that\nk\n(a ) = (1,0,1,0,...).\nk\nIf k = 2j \u2212 1 is odd, the finite list (a ,a ,...,a ) consists of j terms equal to 1\n1 2 2j\u22121\nand j \u22121 terms equal to 0; hence\nj\nC(a ) = .\n2j\u22121\n2j \u22121\nIf k = 2j is even, the finite list (a ,a ,...,a ) consists of j terms equal to 1 and\n1 2 2j\nj terms equal to 0, so C(a ) = 1/2. Thus Lemma 5.10 shows that the sequence\n2j\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nC(a ) converges to 1/2, so the sequence (a ) is Cesa`ro convergent to 1/2.\nk k\nExample 5.30 Suppose (b ) = (a,b,a,b,...) for two (possibly distinct) numbers a\nk\nand b. Referring to the sequence (a ) from Example 5.29, we see that\nk\nb = b+(a\u2212b)a\nk k 241\nfor all k in N. It is easy to verify that\nC(b ) = b+(a\u2212b)C(a ),\nk k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nso the sequence C(b ) converges to b+(a\u2212b)/2 = (a+b)/2.\nk\nExamples 5.29 and 5.30 both illustrate a more general principle: if (a ) is Cesa`ro\nk\nconvergent to a and (b ) is Cesa`ro convergent to b, the sequence (a ,b ,a ,b ,...) is\nk 1 1 2 2\nCesa`ro convergent to (a + b)/2 (see Exercise 5.27). Based on these examples, one\nmight hope that every bounded sequence is Cesa`ro convergent. Unfortunately, that\nturns out not to be the case.\nExample 5.31 Define a sequence (a ) in the following manner. Let a = 1 and\nk 1\na = a = 0, so that\n2 3\n1+0+0 1\nC(a ) = = .\n3\n3 3\nTake a = a = a = 1, so that\n4 5 6\n(1+0+0)+(1+1+1) 2\nC(a ) = = .\n6\n6 3\nNow take a = a = ... = a = 0, so that\n7 8 12\n(1+0+0)+(1+1+1)+(0+0+0+0+0+0) 1\nC(a ) = = .\n12\n12 3\nContinuing this pattern, we take the next 12 terms of (a ) to be 1, then the next 24\nk\nterms to be 0, and so on.\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nIt is not difficult to see that the sequence C(a ) oscillates between the val-\nk\nues 1/3 and 2/3. In this case, C(a ) represents the proportion of terms in the list\nk\n(a ,a ,...,a ) that are equal to 1. If the first m terms of (a ) have been defined,\n1 2 k k\none third of which are equal to 1, then adding m terms equal to 1 means that two 242\nthirds of the resulting 2m terms are equal to 1. The analogous fact holds if we switch\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nthe roles of 0 and 1. Hence the sequence C(a ) diverges, even though the original\nk\nsequence (a ) is bounded.\nk\nWhile any convergent sequence must be bounded, it is possible for an unbounded\nsequence to be Ces`aro convergent.\nExample 5.32 Define\n\uf8f1(cid:114)\nk +1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 , k odd\n\uf8f2\n2\nb = ,\nk (cid:114)\n\uf8f4 k\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3\u2212 , k even\n2\nso that\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n(b ) = (1,\u22121, 2,\u2212 2, 3,\u2212 3,...).\nk\nNote that C(b ) = 0 when k is even and\nk\n(cid:114) (cid:114)\nk +1 k +k\n(cid:114)\n2 2 1\nC(b ) = \u2264 =\nk\nk k k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nwhen k is odd.

Suppose that C(a ) converges, which means that C(a ) must be a Cauchy\nk k\nsequence.

Hence\nk k\nthe desired result follows from Exercise 5.1.\nThe reader may have noticed that every sequence (a ) we have encountered that\nk\nis Cesa`ro convergent, but not convergent in the standard sense, oscillates between\nthe conditions a < a and a > a . This phenomenon is not an accident, but a\nk k+1 k k+1\nmanifestation of a more general principle.\nTheorem 5.35 If (a ) is monotonic, the following three conditions are equivalent:\nk\n(1) The sequence (a ) is bounded.\nk\n(2) The sequence (a ) is convergent.\nk\n(3) The sequence (a ) is Ces`aro convergent.\nk\nProof. The Monotone Convergence Theorem shows that conditions (1) and (2) are\nequivalent. Proposition 5.28 shows that condition (2) implies condition (3). We\nwill now demonstrate that condition (3) implies condition (2), by showing that any\nmonotonic sequence that is not convergent (in the standard sense) is also not Ces`aro\nconvergent.\nLet (a ) be a sequence that is divergent and non-decreasing. Suppose, for the sake\nk\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nof contradiction, that C(a ) converges to a number x. The Monotone Convergence\nk\nTheorem dictates that (a ) must be unbounded, so there is a natural number K such\nk\nthat a > x+1 whenever k \u2265 K. Applying Corollary 5.34 a total of K\u22121 times, we\nk 245\nobtain a sequence (b ) that is also Cesa`ro convergent to x, but with b > x+1 for all\nk k\nk in N. Since\nb +b +...+b k(x+1)\n1 2 k\nC(b ) = > = x+1\nk\nk k\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nfor any k, it is impossible for the sequence C(b ) to converge to x. Thus we have\nk\nobtained a contradiction, so the sequence (a ) cannot be Ces`aro convergent.\nk\nA similar argument holds when (a ) is non-increasing, or we may simply observe\nk\nthat the sequence (\u2212a ) is non-decreasing.\nk\nWhile there are many benefits to working with Ces`aro means, this perspective\ninvalidates several properties that hold with respect to the standard definition of con-\nvergence. For example, the sequence (1,0,1,0,...) is Cesa`ro convergent to 1/2, but\nthe subsequence (1,1,1,1,...) is Ces`aro convergent to 1. In other words, Proposi-\ntion 5.7 no longer holds in the context of Cesa`ro convergence. Similarly, if we take\n(a ) = (1,3,1,3,...) and (b ) = (3,1,3,1,...), Example 5.30 shows that lim C(a ) =\nk k k\nk\u2192\u221e\nlim C(b ) = 2. Since (a b ) = (3,3,3,3,...), we see that\nk k k\nk\u2192\u221e\nlim C(a b ) = 3 (cid:54)= 4 = lim C(a )C(b ).\nk k k k\nk\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e\nTherefore part (3) of the Algebraic Limit Theorem fails to hold for Ces`aro conver-\ngence. Likewise, Example 5.32 demonstrates the peculiar property that both (b ) and\nk\n(1/b ) are Cesa`ro convergent to 0. These observations do not represent a defect in\nk\nour definition of Cesa`ro convergence, but an inevitable consequence of any method\nthat allows us to evaluate such limits. In some instances, one can identify a partial\nsubstitute for a result that has been superseded.\nTheorem 5.36 (Schep\u2019s Inequality) Suppose (a ) and (b ) are both Cesa`ro conver-\nk k\ngent, with a \u2265 0 and b \u2265 0 for all k in N. If the sequence (a b ) is convergent (in\nk k k k 246\nthe standard sense), then lim a b \u2264 lim C(a )\u00b7 lim C(b ).\nk k k k\nk\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e\nProof. If lim a b = 0, the desired inequality holds trivially. Suppose then that\nk k\nk\u2192\u221e\nlim a b > 0. This assumption implies that only finitely many terms a and b equal\nk k k k\nk\u2192\u221e\n0, since otherwise there would be a subsequence of (a b ) converging to 0. Hence we\nk k\nmay apply Corollary 5.34 as many times as necessary to eliminate all the terms that\nequal 0, so we may assume that each a and b is nonzero.\nk k\nThe crux of this argument is the relationship between the harmonic mean and the\narithmetic mean of any finite list (a ,a ,...,a ).

For example, consider the series\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\n(\u22121)k\u22121 = 1\u22121+1\u22121+.... (5.14)\nk=1\nThe corresponding sequence (s ) of partial sums is (1,0,1,0,...). This sequence\nk\ndiverges according to the standard definition, but is Cesa`ro convergent to 1/2. Hence\nwe can describe the series in (5.14) as being Ces`aro convergent (or Ces`aro summable)\nto 1/2.\nProposition 5.33 has a particularly satisfying interpretation in this context.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nCorollary 5.37 If a series a is Cesa`ro convergent, the sequence of terms (a )\nk k\nk=1\nmust be Cesa`ro convergent to 0.\nProof. A series being Ces`aro convergent is equivalent to its sequence of partial sums\n(s ) being Cesa`ro convergent. In that case, Proposition 5.33 shows that\nk\ns a +a +...+a\nk 1 2 k\nlim = lim = 0.\nk\u2192\u221e k k\u2192\u221e k 249\n(cid:0) (cid:1)\nIn other words, the sequence C(a ) converges to 0.\nk\nThis observation should be regarded as the \u201cCes`aro analog\u201d of Corollary 5.15. For\nexample, Corollary 5.37 shows that the series\n\u221e\n(cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\n1+4(\u22121)k\u22121 = 5\u22123+5\u22123+...\nk=1\nis not Cesa`ro convergent, since the sequence (5,\u22123,5,\u22123,...) is Cesa`ro convergent\nto 1.\nTheorem 5.35, which pertains to monotonic sequences, is also applicable to series.\nCorollary 5.38 A series consisting of non-negative terms is Ces`aro convergent if\nand only if it is convergent in the standard sense.\nProof. If the terms of a series are non-negative, the corresponding sequence (s ) of\nk\npartial sums is non-decreasing. Therefore (s ) is Cesa`ro convergent if and only if (s )\nk k\nis convergent.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nFor example, a series of the form 1/kp is Cesa`ro convergent if and only ifp > 1.\nk=1\nSimilarly, the concept of absolute convergence is not affected by considering Cesa`ro\nconvergence. Nevertheless, if we allow the terms of a series to assume both positive\nand negative values, Ces`aro convergence can enlarge the collection of series we may\nview as being convergent (see Exercise 5.31). The following result gives some sense\nof the degree to which this perspective can extend our notion of convergence.\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nProposition 5.39 Suppose a is a series consisting of nonzero terms that is\nk\nk=1\nCesa`ro convergent, but not convergent in the standard sense.

He\nk=1\ndescribed the result as a paradox, noting that the partial sums do not approach\nthe sum of the series.\n(11) The Hahn\u2013Banach Theorem, mentioned briefly at the end of the chapter, was\ndiscovered independently in the 1920s by Hans Hahn (1879\u20131934) and Stefan\nBanach (1892\u20131945).\nExercises\n*Exercise 5.1 Suppose (a ) and (b ) are sequences such that (a \u2212b ) converges to\nk k k k\n0.
