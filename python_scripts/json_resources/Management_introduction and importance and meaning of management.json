It makes human effects more productive and brings better technology, products\nand services to our society. It is a crucial economic resource and a life giving element in business.\nWithout proper management, the resources of production ( men, machines and materials,\nmoney ) can not be converted into production. Thus management is a vital function concerned\nwith all aspects of the working of an organization.\nManagement is a must to accomplish desired goals through group action. It is essential to\nconvert the disorganized resources of men, machines, materials and methods into a useful and\neffective enterprise.\nThus management is the function of getting things done through people and directing the\nefforts of individuals towards a common objective.\n1.2 Meaning and Definitions of Management :\nManagement is the art of maximizing efficiency, as a social process, a method of getting\nthings done through others a plan of action and its direction by a co-operative group moving towards\na common goal. Effective utilisation of available resources to achieve same objective is\nmanagement.\nManagement is a comprehensive function of Planning, Organising, Forecasting Co-\nordinating, Leading, Controlling, Motivating the efforts of others to achieve specific objectives.\nManagement can precisely be called the rule \u2013 making and rule \u2013 enforcing body.\nDefinitions :\nAccording to Harold Koontz \u201c Management is the art of getting things done through and\nwith formally organized groups \u201c.\nAccording to Peter F. Drucker. \u201c A Multipurpose organ that manages a business and\nmanages managers and manages workers and works \u201c.\nAccording to J.Lundy \u201c Management is what management does. It is the task of planning\nexecuting and controlling \u201c.\nAccording to Lawrence Appley \u201c Management is the development of people and not the\ndirection of things \u201c. Principles of Management 1.3 Introduction, Meaning and .....\nAccording to F.W. Tylor \u201c Management is the art of knowing what you want to do in the best\nand cheapest way \u201c.\nMeaning of Management\nManagement It is an art it is the art Deep co-ordination\nis what of taking and science of of human resources\nA manager work done decision making and and factors of\ndoes through others leader ship production\nFig 1.1\nFig 1.2 Centre for Distance Education 1.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nIn nut shell it can be said that management as such is a science of managing men,\nmachines, money materials and methods. It embrasses all duties and functions that pertains to\nthe initiation of an enterprise, its financing, the establishment of all major policies the provisions of\nall necessary equipment, the entailing of general form of orgauisation, under which enterprise is to\noperate and the selection of the principal officers.\n1.3 Characteristics of Management :\n1.3.1 Management is a group activity :\nIt is a group activity. Nobody can satisfy all his desires himself. Therefore he unites which\nhis fellow- beings and works in an organized group to achieve what he cannot achieve individually.\nMassie has rightly called management as a \u201c Co-operative group \u201c.\n1.3.2 Management is Goal - oriented :\nAccording to Theo Haiman \u201c Effective management is always management by objectives.\"\nGroup efforts are directed towards the achievements of some predetermined goals. Mangement\nis concerned with establishment and accomplishment of these objectives.\n1.3.3 Management is a factor of Production :\nManagement is not an end in itself. It is a means to achieve the group objectives. It is a\nfactor of production that is required the co-ordinate with the other factors of production for the\naccomplishment of predetermined goals and objectives.\n1.3.4 It is a Universal Character :\nManagement is essential in all types of concerns. It somewhere there is some human\nactivity, management is must there. The basic principles of management are universal. These\ncan be applied in all types of concerns i.e. business, social, religious, cultural, sports, educational\na International technology.\n1.3.5 Management is needed at all levels of the enterprise :\nOn the basis of the nature of work or target and the scope of authority, management is\nneeded at all levels of the organisations e.g., top level, middle level and supervisor level.\n1.3.6 It is a distinct function :\nManagement is a distinct function performed to fix and achieve stated objectives by the\nuse of manpower and other factors of production. Different from the activities, techniques and\nprocedures, the process of management consists of such functions as planning, organizing,\nstaffing, directing, coordinating, motivating and controlling.\n1.3.7 It is a Social Process :\nManagement is taken as a social process. It has a social responsibility to make reasonable\nuse of scarce resources keeping in view the benefit of the community as a whole.\n1.3.8 System of Authority : Principles of Management 1.5 Introduction, Meaning and .....\nAuthority is the power to compel men to work in a specific manner. Management cannot\nwork in the absence of authority. There is a chain of authority and responsibility among people\nworking at different levels of the organization. There cannot be an efficient management without\nwell defined lives of command a superior subordinate relationship at the every levels of decision\nmaking.\nFig 1.3 : Management as a System\n1.3.9. It is a dynamic function :\nManagement has to be performed continuously, in a rapidly every changing business\nenvironment. It is constantly engaged in the moulding of the enterprise. It is also concerned about\nthe change of environment itself so as to ensure the success of enterprise. Hence it is on-going\nfunction.\n1.3.10 Management is Intangible :\nIt can be seen in the form of results and could not be actually seen. For ex: when we are\nnot able to produce desired quantity, we say it is the result of poor management.\n1.3.11 It is Art as well as Science :\nManagement is a science since its principles have universal application. Management is\nan art as the results of management depends upon the personal skill of managers. The art of the Centre for Distance Education 1.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nmanager is essential to make the best use of management science. Thus management is both\nscience and art.\n1.3.12 It is a Profession :\nIt has systematic and specialized body of knowledge consisting of principles, techniques,\nrules and laws. It can be taught as a specialized subject.\n1.4 Significance of Management :\nManagement plays a unique role modern society. Peter F.Drucker has summarised the\nessence of management as \u201c under developed countries are under managed, it denotes the multi-\ndimensional significance of management. The significance of management can be broadly\nclassified into the groups.\n1. Advantages to the organization.\n2. Advantages to the society.\n14.1 Advantages to the Organisation :\n(i) Determination of Objectives :\nThe success of various operations of an organisation mainly depends on the\nidentification of its objectives. Objectives are identified and laid down by the\nmanagement.They should be the writing and communicated to all others in the\nmanagement.\n(ii) Achieving of objectives :\nIt is the management which directs the group effort towards the achievement of\nvarious objectives. It brings the human and non- human resources together.\n( iii )Meeting challenges :\nAll the policy decisions of an enterprise are taken by the management. It keeps in\ntouch with the current environment and predicts what is going to happen in future.\nThrough better planning and control, management steers a concern to meet the\ndemands of the changing environment.\n( iv) Provides innovation :\nManagement infuses an enterprise with new ideals, imaginations and vision.\n( v) Smooth running of business :\nManagement helps in smooth running of business through better planning and\ncontrol.\n1.4.2 Advantages to the Society :\n(i) Optimum utilisation of Resources : Principles of Management 1.7 Introduction, Meaning and .....\nIt is the management which makes optimum utilisation of various resources such\nas land, labour, capital and enterprise. \u201c No ideology, no ism, no political theory can\nwin greater output with less efforts, only sound management\u201d, says Urwick and\nBrech.\n( ii) Social Benifits:\nManagement raises the standared of living of the people by providing good quality\nproducts at the lowest prices. It also promotes peace and prosperity in the society\nthrough optimum use of scarce resources.\n( iii ) Role in national economic development :\n\u201cManagement is the crucial factor in economic and social development\u201d, says Peter\nF.Druker. The development of a nation mainly depends on the quality of management\nof its resources. It is all the more true in a developing country like India, where\nproductivity is low and the resources are limited.\n( iv ) Employment :\nThe expansion and diversification activites of the managers in organisations create\nmore employement to the society. This is very essential for our country.\n1.5 Importance of Management :\nManagement is overall the most important factor because no business runs on itself, even\nno momentum. Every business needs repeated stimulus which can only be provided by\nmanagement. Thus, management is dynamic, life giving element without which the \u201c factors of\nproduction \u201c will remain as were factors not become \u201c Production \u201c.\nThe following points bring out the importance of management.\n1. Accomplishment of group goals.\n2. Efficient operations of business.\n3. Sound organization structure.\n1.5.1 Accomplishment of group goals :\nSuccess of a business enterprise depends on three important factors, viz\n( a ) how economically and efficiently the organization has used its man power and\nphysical resources.\n( b ) how effectively it has adapted the enterprise to the prevailing business environment\ne.g. needs and expectations of the customers, policies of rivals and\n( c ) how far the existing business policies have succeeded in realising the goals\nand objectives of the organisations. Centre for Distance Education 1.8 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nThis ensures efficiency the every sphere of activity and also enables quick modifications\nor alteration of a specific strategy or programme if any deficiency is noticed any where.\n1.5.2 Efficient operation of business :\nEfficient of an organisation depends on ability, experience, skills, co-operation zeal and\nenthusiasm to its employees. This, inturn, depends on proper motivation of there employee which\ncan be accomplished only by an inspiring leadership provided by management. Management makes\nsure that the workers know their jobs, helps them in improving their skills and abilities in doing their\njobs.\n15.3 Sound organisation structure :\nManagement establishes a sound organisation that is in accordance with the desired\nobjectives and goals and the weak to be done of accomplish them. Management establishes a\nsystem of authority and responsibility relationships, who will command whom, who will be\nresponsible for what, and who shall be accountable to whom.\nFig 1.4\n1.6 Management Vs Administration :\nAdministration is a thinking function and where as management is a doing function. Principles of Management 1.9 Introduction, Meaning and .....\nSheldon opines, \"Administration is concerned with determination of the corporate policy,\nthe coordination of finance, production and distribution the settlement of the compass of the\norganisation and the ultimate control of executive \".\nAdministration is generally regarded as a top level activity which is mainly concerned with\nlaying down broad goals and objectives. Management on the other hand, is concerned with the\naccomplishment of those goals and policies.\nOn the other hand, management, is concerned with the execution of policy, within the\nlimits set up by the administration and the employment of the organization for the particular object\nset before it. It is shown in the following figure.\nWorkers ( Core group)\nFig 1.5 Levels of Organisation Centre for Distance Education 1.10 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nSeveral authors have raised controversies between management and administrations.\nNow let us see the basic differences between Management and Administration.\nDistinction between Administration and Management\nAdministration Management\n1. It is concerned with the formation of 1. It means getting things done through and\nwith objectives, plans and policies. people.\n2. It is a thinking function. 2. It is a doing function\n3. It is a top- level management function. 3. It is a lower \u2013level management functions.\n4. It makes major policy decisions. 4. It makes decisions with the frame work of\nadministration.\n5. Decisions are influenced by external 5. Decisions are influenced by internal factors\nfactors such as social, political, legal etc. such as values, beliefs, and opinions.\n6. Administration is often associated with 6. Management is widely used in the business.\ngovernment policies. world\n1.7 Managerial Skills :\nA skill is an acquired and learned ability to translate knowledge into performance. It is the\ncompetency of a person that allows his performance to be superior. All managers need to possess\nvarious skills which are necessary to carry at their jobs successfully.\n(i) Technical skills : Technical skills are necessary to accomplish or understand the\nspecific kind of working done in an organisation. The persons who are working with\ntools and techniques are needed such skill. Ex: Engineers, Scientists , Computer\nprogrammers etc. Technical skills are essential for first line managers who spend their\ntime in training their subordinates and clear their doubts regarding were.\n(ii) Human skills : Human skill is the ability to work with other people in a cooperative\nmanner. Human skill are essential to hence effective team work in the organisation. It\ninvolves patience, understanding trust and genuine involvement in interpersonal\nrelationship.\n(iii)Analytical skills : These skills are essential to identify key factors and to understand\nthe interrelate roles they play in a given situation. Analytical skills help a manager to\nestablish cause and effect relationship. These skills also help a manager for problem\nidentifying, solving and decisicu making.\n(iv)Conceptual skills : Such skills are essential to the managers to understand the overall\nworking of the organisation and harmonise the working of the sub- systems for reaching\nthe organisational objectives.\n(v) Communication skills : Communication skills are an important element of interpersonal\nskills. Communication is essential for proper implementation of orders. The best ideas Principles of Management 1.11 Introduction, Meaning and .....\nof manager may not be of any use if these are not properly communicated to\nsubordinates.\n(vi)Decision-making skills : Decision making is the process of reaching a point. It is\nchoosing the best alternative of doing a thing from various choices available. Manager\nmay make use of various techniques available for taking decisions.\n1.8 Managerial Roles :\nThe more complex the organization, the more crucial his role. The success of and\norganisation will depend upon the caliber of a manager to achieve its objectives.\nHenry Mintzberg\u2019s opines every manager, plays roles in three areas.\n1.8.1 Inter personal Relationships :\n(a) As a Figure head.\n(b) Leadership role.\n(c) Liason officer.\n1.8.2 Information processing :\n(a) Monitoring Information\n(b) Disseminating Information.\n(c) Organisations Spokesman.\n1.8.3 Decision Making :\n(a) As an Entrepreneur\n(b) As a Conflict Handler\n(c) As a Resource Allocate\n(d) As a Negotiator\n1.9 Universality of Management :\nUniversality of management means transmission of management knowledge from are\norganisation to a different organisation. From one country to another country and from are manager\nto incumbents through training and development. Management principles have universal application\nbecause management is a universal process. Universality of management principles also mean\nthat managers are transferable from one country to another country. This concept has come into\nlime light ever since management was recognised as science, because science and scientific\nprinciples have universal application. But management is regarded as inexact science, its universal Centre for Distance Education 1.12 Acharya Nagarjuna University\napplication is questioned. Some authors have favoured it, where as other negated. We can observe\ntheir arguments as follows.\n1.9.1 Arguments for universality :\n(i) Management process is universal : The management process is similar among\nmanagers. In the words of Fayol. There is a universal science of management\napplicable alike to commerce, industry, politics, religion war or philanthrophy.\n(ii) Management knowledge is universal :\n(a) Management is culture - bound : Culture consists of attitudes, beliefs,\nand values of a society. As management is people oriented there is always\na possibility that application of management principles will be affected by\nculture. Ground rules under which a manager operates are different in\ndifferent cultures then common strategies of management will not be\npossible.\n(b) Different objectives : The objectives of an enterprise determine the type\nof management required. Different enterprises have different objectives.\nSo these managerial needs are linked to these objectives.\n(c) Differences in Philosophies : Philosophies of one organization vary from\nthe other. Philosophies refer to those general concepts and integrated\nattitudes that are basic to an enterprise. Managers operate with a specific\nphilosophy in a particular enterprise. This philosophy can be different even\nin the same type of enterprise.\n(iii) Management skills and principles are transferable : Management skills and\nprinciples are transferable from are person to another, from are organisation to\nanother, from one country to another. When skills and principles can be transferred\nthen it has universal applicability.\n1.9.2 Arguments against universality :\nSome exports feel that management principles and knowledge do not have universal\napplication due to cross- culture differences. They are also of the view that same management\nskills can not be applied in all situations and fields and the skills are not transferable. Peter Drucker,\nstates that \u201c The skill, the competence, the experience of management cannot, as such be\ntransferred and applied to the organisation and running of other institutions . A career in management\nis, by itself, not a preparation for major political office or for leadership in the armed forces, the\nchurch or a university \u2019\u2019.\nIt can be concluded that basic principles and functions of management are universal in\nnature. These can be applied in every type of organisation and in every country. The application of\nthese principles, however may vary from person to person. The art and practice of management\nalways varies from situations to situations and it is culture bound. Principles of Management 1.13 Introduction, Meaning and .....\n1.10 The Management Challenges :\nThe management is facing challenges from within and outside the organisation. The\ncomplexities of managerial environment in the country would require a complete overhaul of\nmanagement functions, roles and skills coping with the future challenges.\nChallenges facing the management of tomorrow are :\n(a) Internationalization of Business.\n(b) Technological changes.\n(c) Transition from Industrial to knowledge based society.\n(d) Changes in work force.\n(e) Decision making process.\n(f) Ethical and Social Responsibility.\n1.11 Summary :\nIn this chapter attempt is made to explain meaning and definitions of management.\nManagement can be defined as an economic resource, as a group, as a subject of study and as\na process. It also explained management Vs administration and concluded basically they are\nsimilar. It also needs an attempt to explain levels of management, and management principles are\nuniversally applicable subject to environmental modification.\n1.12 Key words :\nManagement : Art of getting things done through others\nAdministration : Administration is concerned with the determination of overall objectives\nand policies of an enterprise.\nManagerial skill : A Skill is an acquired and learned ability to translate knowledge into\nperformance.\nTechnical skill : Skill required to accomplish or understand the specific kind of work\ndone in an organisation.\nConceptual skill : Skill required to understand the overall working of the organisation.\nObjectives : End to a specific course of action.\nOrganisation : It is a group of people formed to achieve prescribed goal.\nUniversality : It refers to application of knowledge and skills through out the world.\n1.13 Self - Assessment Questions :\n1.

The basic\nobjective to this approach is to transform all aspects of management phenomenon into the domain\nof standardised processes of decision making so that some of the available and tested decision\nmaking techniques can be utilised in solving some of the problems. In that respect the tools of\nmanagement science are used to diagnose and analyse the problem and to find the best solution\nvia the analysis of the possible consequences of different solutions. Centre for Distance Education 2.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n2.2 Historical Development :\nManagement science is also referred to by other names such as quantitative analysis,\ndecision sciences, systems analysis etc. Even though the application of scientific methods to\nmanagement problems is comparatively more recent, some of the underlying principles were\ndeveloped many centuries ago. For example, the probability theory was developed by Pascal and\nCalculus by Newton sometime in the 17th century. The dawn of the 20th century saw some early\ndevelopments in the area of inventory control by Ford Harris and R.H. Wilson, some dynamic\nmodels developed by Markov and an analysis of queuing theory by A.K. Erlang. However,\nmanagement science as a field of study began during world war II in Britain by a group of scientists\nunder professor P.M.S. Blackelt. Commissioned by the army to analyse and solve some complex\narmy operational decision problems. The group was known as army operational research group\nthat was involved in finding solutions to highly complex and strategic situations such as convoy\nrouting searching of submarines, optimum depth for detonating anti submarine charges, selecting\noptimum gun sites, planning defense tactics against suicides attacks etc. This was the birth of the\noperations research fields, which has since been successfully applied in solving problems in a\nvariety of areas including resource allocation where the resources are scarce and exhaustible,\ninventory, control problems, maintenance and replacement, game theory, waiting line problems,\nrouting etc.\nFollowing the war, the applications of operations research techniques extended into industry\nspecially large size industries such as oil refineries, steel and paper mills. The decades of 1950\u2019s\nand 1960\u2019s saw a dramatic development and refinement of these solutions to many complex\nindustrial, business and military problems and these solutions were further aided by the development\nand extensive use of fast computers which handled large quantities of data and calculated various\nrelationships of a large number of variables in a short period of time.\n2.3 Management Science \u2013 Four Distinguishing Aspects :\nAccording to Paul Loomba, management science is both a body of knowledge as well as\nan analytical approach to solving problems. As a body of knowledge, it consists of various\nmanagement theories, models tools and techniques including theories dealing with individual,\ngroup and organizational behaviour, planning scheduling and control. This knowledge also develops\nan attitude with which the management scientists view and approach management problems and\nmanagerial situations. As an analytical approach to solving specific problems the management\nscience models and techniques have been used extensively in various situations relating to\nadministrative as well as operational problems.\nManagement science has four distinguishing aspects. These are :\n1. Use of scientific method\n2. A systems orientation.\n3. An inter \u2013 disciplinary team approach\n4. The use of models. Principles of Management 2.3 Management An Inter - Disciplinary\n2.4 Use of Scientific Method :\nThe Scientific Method is a logical, formalized and systematic observation of the phenomenon\nin order to establish a behavior of the system containing the problem, formulation of the hypothesis\ndescribing the interaction of the factors involved, verification of this hypothesis and implementation\nof the results. These steps are as follows:\nStep one \u2013 observation :\nAfter the problem has been identified and isolated, all relevant information about the problem\nis gathered and objectively recorded and refined.\nStep two \u2013 Formulation of hypothesis :\nA Hypothesis is what the manager believes will occur, based upon the information so\ngathered. Based upon this belief a course of action can be established.\nStep three \u2013 Testing and verification of Hypothesis :\nIn this stage, a course of action is adopted and the investigator verifies the correctness of\nthe hypothesis by observing the results of the decision.\nStep Four \u2013 Implementation, monitoring and control :\nWhen a course of action is accepted and is succeful, the decision is implemented. This\ncontrol process should be imbedded in the system so that continuous feedback is automatically\nmeasured and if there are any changes in any aspects or parameters of them, these can be\nquickly detected and rectified.\n2.5 The systems orientation :\nThe systems approach promotes the idea that the organization is an open system where\nthe parts and all the sub-systems interact with each other as well as with the external environment.\n2.6 Management is an inter \u2013 disciplinary and Multi \u2013 disciplinary\napproach :\nInter disciplinary :\nThe discipline of management science is primarily used to solve highly complex problems\nwith a multitude of inter - related variables, with multi dimensional aspects, so that views of various\nspecialists from diversified back grounds must be integrated, so that this diversity produces a\nsynergistic effect. The inter \u2013 disciplinary approach becomes highly useful for many management\nproblems which have physical, psychological, biological, sociological, technical and economic\naspects. When specialists from various disciplines are called upon, some new and advanced\napproaches to old problems are often obtained. Centre for Distance Education 2.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nThe Army operational research group formed under Prof. Blackett in 1940 included\nPhysicists, Mathematical Physicists, Astrophysicists, Mathematicians, Physiologists, Surveyors\netc. Accordingly, this approach analysis the problem from various angles and aspects through the\npooling of specialized talents and skills so that all ramifications of the problems can be considered.\nMulti \u2013 Disciplinary approach :\nManagement uses concepts, ideas, generalizations and principles of other disciplines to\nshow better results. To enhance the quality of decisions, use of statistical devices and mathematical\ntools has become a style of the manager. Similarly, use of knowledge of economics, psychology\nsociology and anthropology for understanding human behaviour and analyzing the market forces\nhas become a regular feature.\n2.7 The use of Models :\nThis is the most effective and most often used tool of management science for solving\nintense and complex problems. A model is simply a representation of a system or an object or a\nrealistic situation in some form, formuted to explain the behaviour of the entity itself. It simplifies\nthe real life situation which it reflects. For example, an organisation chart is a form of a model\nrepresenting the structure of the organisation. A model is constructed in such a manner that it\napproximates those aspects of reality that are being investigated so that the system can be analysed\nand better decisions can be made.\n2.8 Summary :\nManagement science is both a body of knowledge as well as and analytical approach to\nsolving problems. As a body of knowledge, it consists of various management theories, models,\ntools and techniques including theories dealing with individual, group and organisational behaviour,\nplanning scheduling and control.\nManagement science has four distinguishing aspects. These are.,\n1. Use of Scientific method.\n2. A systems orientation\n3. An inter \u2013 disciplinary team approach.\n4. The use of models.\nThese aspects are slowing specifi problems with in the organisation.\n2.9 Technical Terms :\n1. Inter \u2013 disciplinary : Mutual relations\n2. Orientation : Habitual\n3.

It is necessary to understand the real nature\nof management. The learning of art involves its continuous practice while learning of science\ninvolves assimilation of principles. The earlier captains of industry and managers used intvition,\ncommonsense, hunches and experience in man1aging organizations. They were brilliant and hard\nworking but still were not professionally trained managers. This was the main reason of controversy\nabout the management.\n3.2 Management as an Art :\nAn art is often regarded as the systematic application of skill or knowledge in effecting\naccomplishment of results. It represents the methods or ways of doing specific things and indicates\nhow an objective is to be achieved. The function of art is to effect change and accomplish results\nthrough deliberate efforts. Art is a personalised process and every artist has his own style. It is\npractice \u2013 based and perfection in it requires continuous practice over a long period of time.\n3.2.1 The main elements of Art are :\n( a ) Personal Skill.\n( b ) Practical Knowledge.\n( c ) Result \u2013 oriented approach.\n( d ) Regular Practice.\n( e ) Creativity.\n3.2.1 ( a ) Personal Skill :\nLike any other artist, a manager also uses his knowledge and skill in co \u2013 ordinating the\nactivities of people in the organisation. Management is an art of dealing with people to accomplish\ndesired results.\n3.2.1 ( b ) Practical Knowledge :\nManagement is concerned with the application of knowledge and skill, unless managerial\nprinciples are used for making the things effective and better, these will not be covered in art.\n3.2.1 ( c) Result \u2013 oriented approach :\nManagement is result oriented because it is concerned with accomplishment of objectives.\nIt aims at achieving maximum productivity at lowest costs.\n3.2.1 ( d ) Regular Practice :\nLike an artist, management always tries to attain higher and higher goals in order to reach\nthe state of absolute perfection. This efficiency and effectiveness is attained through regular practice. Principles of Management 3.3 Management an Art or Science\n3.2.1 ( e ) Creativity :\nEvery art has an element of creativity and in this sense also management is one of the\nmost creative art as it is concerned with getting work done through others by motivating them to\nwork and co-ordinating their activities.\n3.3 Management As a Science :\nThe word science literally means knowledge. It is a systematised body of knowledge\nacquired by mankind through observation and experimentation and which is capable of verification.\nThe basic difference between Art and Science is that Art implies knowing, how the application,\nwhere as Science is concerned with knowing why? In the words of Keynes \u201c Science is a\nsystematised body of knowledge which establishes relationship between cause and effect \u201c.\nThe essential features of Science :\n1. It is a systemalised body of knowledge that uses scientific methods for\nobservation.\n2. The Principles are evolved on the basis of continued observation.\n3. The principles are exact and have universal applicability without any limitation.\n4. The principles establish a cause and effect relationship between various factors.\n5. The validity of scientific principles can be verified and they provide a reliable\nbasis for predicting future events.\nLet us now apply these features of science to management to determine whether it qualifies\nas science ?\n3.3.1 Systematized Body of Knowledge :\nManagement is viewed as a science as it is an organised body of knowledge built up by\nmanagement practioners, thinkers and philosophers over a period of time. \u201c Management science\nis body of systematised knowledge accumulated and accepted with reference to the understanding\nof general truths concerning management \u201c.\nThe principles of management make use of scientific methods for observation. Frederick\nW. Taylor, the Father of Scientific Management applied scientific techniques to studies of planning,\norganising, staffing, motivating etc.\n3.3.2 Continued Observation :\nAs applied to management, the principles of management have been developed after\ncontinued observation. The knowledge of management has been acquired through continuous\nand vigorous effects of many theorists and practitioners over a period of years.\n3.3.3 Universal Application:\nIn the field of management, this knowledge has been accumulated and accepted with\nreference to general truths. There are certain fundamental principles of management which can Centre for Distance Education 3.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nbe universally approved. In the words of Taylor \u201c The fundamental principles of management are\napplicable to all human activities from our simplest individual acts to the working of our great\ncorporations \u201c.\n3.3.4 Cause and effect Relation ship :\nScientific principles establish cause and effect relationship between various factors. When\n1\napplied to management the principles of management also establish cause and effect relationship.\ne.g. : Poor planning and plant layout cause low productivity.\n3.3.5 Validity and predictability :\nMore knowledge or collection of facts is not science. It is only when the knowledge so\ngathered can be verified, it becomes science. The principles of management also be verified for\ntheir validity. The principles of management have been put to several tests and found to be valid.\nFor Ex: a subordinate put under one boss will show better results, than a subordinate who has to\nfollow two or more bosses. Further, the principles of management by finding cause and effect\nrelationship can serve reliable basis for predicting further events.\n3.4 Management As An InExact or a A Social Science :\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that management is a science. But it must be noted\nthat unlike physics, chemistry and Biology, It is not exact or accurate science. The principles of\nmanagement cannot be considered as fundamental truths. At times, they may not bring desired\nresults and may not have universal application. The main reason for the inexact of the science of\nmanagement is that it deals with human beings whose behaviour cannot be predicted. Thus we\ncan say that management is a \u201c Soft Science\u201d or \u201c behavioural science \u201c and it belongs to a group\nof social Sciences like Sociology, Political Science.\n3.5 Management as a pure Science suffers from the following\nlimitations :\n1. It does not consist of fundamental truths only.\n2. The Principles of management do not always have a universal application.\n3. Behaviour of human beings cannot be predicted.\n4. Management lacks certainty about results.\n3.6 Management \u2013 A Science as well as an Art :\nFrom the above we can say that management has elements of both art and science. It\nmay not be proper to term it as pure science or pure art. In fact, it is a science as well as an art\nbecause science and art are both complementary to each other. As Cossa has said \u201c Science\nrequires art, art requires science, each being complementary to each other \u201c. It may be concluded\nthat there is no hard and fast line between art and science of management . The Science has to\nsolve problems and establish principles which might be applied with a benefit to the art. Principles of Management 3.5 Management an Art or Science\nIn the words of Dean Stanely F. Teele, \u201c Management is a mixture of art and science.\nThe present ratio is about 90% art and 10% science. Though a very great deal of developments\nare presently increasing that proportion which can properly be called science. I am willing to venture\na guess that by the end of another generation the ratio will be 80% Art and perhaps 20%. Science\n\u201d .\n3.7 Management \u2013 As a profession :\nA profession is an \u201c occupation backed by organized knowledge and training and to which\nentry is regulated by a representative body \u201c.\nThus, all professions are occupations in the sense that they provide means of livelihood.\nHowever, all occupations are not professions because some of them lack certain features\nof a profession.\nFeatures of Profession :\n(i) Organised body of knowledge, principles and techniques.\n(ii) Formal training and education.\n(iii) Restriction on entrance.\n(iv) Existence of a representative body.\n(v) Prevalence of a code of conduct.\n(vi) Spirit of service to the society.\nApplication of the features to the management :\n(i) Organised body of knowledge :\nManagement has its own body of systemalised knowledge which contains the\nprinciples and techniques. These principles established cause and effect relationships\nand are capable of universal application. A.P.M. Fleming has rightly remarked that\nmanagement has \u201d. a technique quite a part from the technology of the particular works\nconcerned.\n( ii) Formal training and Education :\nManagement is not merely theory. Here the person is prepared to take practical\ndecision in business. To import management education and training, there are a large\nnumber of formal institutes in various countries, including India. Several tools of management\nsuch as business, Psychology, Business law, Statistics, Data- processing, operations\nresearch and cost accounting etc. have been developed. The business houses today prefer\nto employ those managerial personal who have obtained a professional degree in\nmanagement from some recognised institutes. Centre for Distance Education 3.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n(iii) Restriction on Entrance :\nEntrance into a profession is restricted by standards established by it. But management\ndoes not restrict the entry of people into managerial jobs with only a special academic\ndegree.\n(iv) Existence of an organisation :\n1\nVarious management organisations have come into existence in India to guide the managers\nin\n(i) To regulate the behaviours of members.\n(ii) To create a code of conduct for guiding the activities of the Profession.\n(iii) To promote and build up the image of management as a Profession.\nIn India, All India Management Association and Indian Association for Management\nDevelopment were established to train the managers.\nFunction of Association is to manage and co- ordinate the research work in the various\nareas of management. It is, however, true that norms of managerial behaviour have not yet been\nestablished and we do not have uniform methods of entry.\n( v) Prevalence of a Code of Conduct :\nEvery profession formulates its own ethical codes for the conduct of its members. But\nthere is no uniform code of conduct for the practicing managers. In spite of it, managers are\nsocially responsible. They have to protect the interest of the owners, workers, suppliers, consumers\nand the government\n(vi) Spirit of Service to the Society :\nThough professionals charge fee for the service rendered, they give priority to service over\nthe desire for monetary reward.\nFor Ex: a doctor earns his livelihood from his profession of medicine but service to society\nis upper most in his mind. As managers enjoy the respect of society, they should also fulfill their\nsocial obligation.\n3.8 Conclusion :\nManagement does not fulfill all the requirements of a profession. But it is moving in the\ndirection of a profession on account of the\na. Support of a well defined body of knowledge.\nb. Growing emphasis on formal training of managers.\nc. Growing emphasis on the ethical conduct of management personal and their\nsocial responsibility. Principles of Management 3.7 Management an Art or Science\nManagement Process :\nManagement was defined as a Process . Process means a series of operations or actions\nnecessary to achieve certain results. It is a human and social process directed at individuals to\nget things done by them. It consists of many actions or activities or functions which are to be\ncarried out in a logical sequence. Management is a continuous process because it has no definable\nend and steps or elements involved in it are to be performed in a continuous cycle. The elements\nor activities which are performed in this process are known as functions of management.\nBrech states \u201c Management is a social process entailing responsibility for the effective\nand economical planning and regulation of the operation of an enterprise \u201c.\nManagement functions varies from are another to another.\nAccording to Henry Fayol :\nFunctions of management are classified into five categories.\n(i) Forecasting and Planning.\n(ii) Organising\n(iii) Commanding\n(iv) Co-ordinating and\n(v) Controlling\nAccording to Lyndall Urwick\nHe classified the management functions into six categories.\n(i) Forecasting\n(ii) Planning\n(iii) Organising\n(iv) Command\n(v) Co-ordination and\n(vi) Control\nAccording to L . Gullick :\nHe explained the functions of management by a keyword \u201c POSDCORB \u201d.

Plan Achieve\nmodification\nAppraise\nOn the basis of the classification of managerial functions made by various famous advocates and\nauthors, we can conclude that the following comprehensive classification of managerial functions.\nManagerial Functions Principles of Management 3.9 Management an Art or Science\nPlanning :\nPlanning is the basic managerial function. Planning helps in determining the course of\naction to be followed for achieving various organisational objectives. It is a decision taken in advance,\nwhat to do, when to do, how to do, and who will do a particular task. Planning is a process which\ninvolves \u201c thinking before doing \u201c. Planning is concerned with the mental state of the manager.\nHence planning is regarded as a thinking function than a doing functions. Other functions of\nmanagement such as Planning, Organising, Directing and Controlling are also undertaken after\nplanning. It is a continuous process that takes place at all levels of management.\nIt involves the selection of organizational objectives and developing policies, procedures,\nprograms, budgets and strategies. Thus a detailed planning is done in the beginning but the actual\nperformance is reviewed and suitable changes are made in plans when actual execution is done.\nOrganising :\nOrganising is to arrange, guide, co-ordinate direct and control the activities of other factors\nof production viz, men, material, money and machines. So as to accomplish the objectives of the\nenterprise.\nSteps in organising :\n(i) To identify the work to be performed\n(ii) To Classify the work\n(iii) To assign these groups of work to individuals\n(iv) To delegate authority and ascertain the responsibility.\n(v) To co-ordinate these authority responsibility relationships of various activities.\nA Sound organisation contributes greatly to the continuity and success of an organisation.\nHow ever, an organisation is not an end in itself. Therefore organisation structure should be flexible.\nThus organisation provides the necessary frame work with in which people associate for the\nattainment of business objectives.\nStaffing :\nAccording to O\u2019Donnel, Staffing is \u201c filling, and keeping filled position in the organisation\nstructure through defining work force requirements, appraising, selecting, compensating and training\n\u201c.\nThe function involves manning the positions created by organisation process. It is concerned\nwith human resources of an organisation. Centre for Distance Education 3.10 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n1\nStaffing consists of the following :\n(i) man power planning i.e. assessing manpower requirements in terms of quantity\nand quality\n(ii) recruitment, selection and training\n(iii) placement of man power.\n(iv) development, promotion transfer and appraisal\n(v) determination of employee remuneration.\nEvery manager in an organisation has to perform the staffing function in are form or the\nother, in order to get things done through others. But it is decidedly a difficult managerial function\nas it concerns human beings whose behaviour and actions cannot be predicted, and that is why it\nhas become a distrint and specialised branch of management.\nDirecting :\n\u201c Direction is moving to action and supplying simulative power to the group \u201c-says R.Terry.\nAfter planning, organizing, and staffing the manager has to guide and supervise in which a manager\ninfluences the actions of subordinates. It is the final action of the manager in getting others to act\nafter all preparations have been completed. Directing is a continuous functions and is performed\nat all levels of management.\nThe main activities involved in direction are as follows :\n(a) Leading\n(b) Communication\n(c) Motivation\n(d) Supervision Principles of Management 3.11 Management an Art or Science\n(a) Leadership :\nA manager has to issue orders and instructions to his subordinates. He has to guide his\nsubordinates in their work in order to improve their performance and achieve enterprise objectives.\nIt is the process by which an executive imaginatively directs and influences the work of others in\nchoosing and attaining specified goals by mediating between the individual and organisation. In\nsuch a manner that both will get satisfaction at maximum. It is the ability to build up confidence and\nzeal among working groups and to create an urge in them, to be led.\nIn order to be a successful leader, a manager must possess the qualities of foresight ,\ndrive, initiative, self \u2013confidence and personal integrity. Different situations demand different type\nof leadership, such as autocratic leadership, democratic leadership and free rein leadership.\n(b) Communication :\nCommunication means sharing of ideas in common. The essence of communication is\ngetting the receiver and the sender tuned together for a particular message. It refers to the exchange\nof ideas, feelings, emotions and knowledge and informations between two or more persons. Nothing\nhappens in the management till communication takes place.\nCommunication is a two \u2013 way process as it involves both information and understanding.\nIt may be written, oral, gastural communication flows downward from a superior to subordinates\nand upward from a superior to subordinates and upward from subordinates to a superior. It also\nflows between two or more persons operating at the same level of authority\nCommunication is essential at all levels of management for decision making and planning.\nIt increases managerial capacity and facilitates control. It has been rightly said that good managers\nare good communicators and poor managers are poor communicators.\n(c) Motivation :\nMotivation is the psychological process of creating urge among the subordinates do certain\nthings or behave in the desired manner. A manager has to provide some personal incentive to the\nsubordinates to motivate, persuade and inspire them for contributing their best towards the\nachievement of enterprise objectives . A sound motivational system must be productive, competitive\ncomprehensive and flexible and it must consider the psychological, social, safety, ego and economic\nneeds of the workers.\n(d) Supervision :\nSupervision is an important directing functions of management. After issuing instructions,\nthe manager or the supervisor to the job is required to see subordinates at work to ensure maximum\nutilisation of resources, to get the required and directed was done and to correct the subordinate\nwhenever they go wrong. Though supervision is performed at all levels of management, the major\nresponsibility for it lies with the first line of management.\nCo-ordination :\nCo-ordination is essential to channelise the activities of various individuals in the organisation\nfor the achievement of common goals. The management has to see that the work of different\nsegments is going according to predetermined targets and corrective measures have to be taken\nif there is any deviation. Co \u2013ordination creates a team spirit and helps in achieving goals through Centre for Distance Education 3.12 Acharya Nagarjuna University\ncollective efforts. It is the orderly arrangement of group effort to provide unity of action in the pursuit\nof common objectives.\nControlling :\nControlling is the process of ensuring that the organization is moving in the desired\ndirection and that progress is being made towards the achievement of goals.\n1\nSteps in controlling :\n(a) establishing standards for measuring work performance.\n(b) measurement of actual performance and comparing it with the standards.\n(c) finding variances between the two and the reasons therefore, and.\n(d) taking corrective action for correcting deviations so as to ensure attainment of\nobjectives.\nThe management process mentioned above is Universal to all the managers irrespective\nof levels and organisations with little deviations. It is never ended process, because after controlling\nis completed, it gives the basis for planning and again planning starts. That is why management\nprocess is represented like a circle as follows.\n3.9 SUMMARY :\nIn this chapter an attempt is made to explain management as science or art, and stated\nthat it has the characteristics of both the areas. Attempt is also made to explain management as\na profession. The lesson bring out the concepts and formulation of the managerial functions, such\nas planning, organising , Staffing, Directing and Controlling. They form as a continuous process of\nmanagerial performance in the organisation. Principles of Management 3.13 Management an Art or Science\n3.10 KEY WORDS :\n1.

However, the study of how managers\nachieve results in predominantly a twentieth century phenomenon. The rich history of the\nmanagement made it resourceful, varied and multi-dimensional. Management is transient from\ntime depending on the prevalent philosophies. Industrial Revolution brought out the necessity of\ndeveloping a theory of management. Hence, a large variety of concepts emanated in the field of\nmanagement from classical to neo-classical to modern. The chronological contributions of\nmanagement thinkers is known as Evolution of Management thought which have formulated\nmanagement theory. For the purpose of study it is divided into three stages, each covering different\nperiod and ideology of the contributors.\na. Bureaucratic model \u2013 Max Webber \u2013 1900\nb. Scientific Management \u2013 F.W. Taylor- 1910\nc. Process Management \u2013 Henry Fayol \u2013 1910 Centre for Distance Education 4.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nThe Neo- Classical Theory :\nIt consists of two streams of thought\na. Human Relation Movement \u2013 Elton Mayo and Roethlisberger \u2013 1930\nb. Behavioural Sciences Movement \u2013 Maslow, Mc Gregor \u2013 1940\nThe Modern Management Theories\nIt comprises three streams of thought\na. Quantitative Approach \u2013 Taylor \u2013 1950\nb. Systems Approach \u2013 Boulding, Johnson \u2013 1950\nc. Contingency Approach \u2013 Lorsch, Lawrence\n4.2 APPROACHES TO MANAGEMENT THOUGHT :\nThe initial efforts towards management principles could be traced from the organisational\npractices of Roman Catholic church, military organisations and the cameralists who proposed\ncertain principles like scalar chain, specialisation, line of command, selection of subordinates and\ntheir training and unity of doctrine etc., later on certain valuable contributions pertaining to mostly\nthe field of human resources and relations come from James Walt, Robert Owen, Charles Babbage\nand Henry Poor. However, the real development of management thought has started with the\nScientific Management by F.W.Taylor.\n4.2.1 Scientific Management by F.W. Taylor :\nFrederick Winslow Taylor has made the major attempt to systematize the management\ntheory through the publication of \u201c The Principles of Scientific Management \u201c in 1911. Eventually,\nhe is known as the Father of Scientific Management. He wrote Scientific Management with his\nlong experience as an engineer at various levels of functioning from an apprentice to the Chief\nEngineer of a steel company. His philosophy is also known as Taylorism.\nAccording to F.W.Taylor, it is not proper to find just a way for doing something, a manager\nhas to find the one right way. His major concern was to increase efficiency in production, it includes\nnot only to lower costs and raise profits, but also to increase pay for workers through their higher\nproductivity. Further he emphasized that managers should be responsible for analysis and planning\nof work in advance, whereas workers should be responsible for the performance of the work as\nper plans.\nPrinciples of Scientific Management :\nTaylor has endeavored to introduce scientific approach in business and management and\nwanted to make it as exact as possible. The basic principles are stated as follows.\na. Replacing rules of thump with science.\nb. Harmony in group action than discord. Principles of Management 4.3 Evolution of Management Thought\nc. Cooperation than individualism.\nd. Working for maximum output than restricted output.\ne. Developing workers to the fullest extent.\nElements of Scientific Management :\nF.W.Taylor opined \u2018 Management is the art of knowing exactly what you want men to do and\nseeing that they do it in the best and cheapest way. He advocated the following elements of Scientific\nManagement.\nWork Study :\nWork Study is related to analyzing work to be performed by eliminating unnecessary\noperations and finding out the quicker way of doing it. Works study eliminates wasteful and\nunnecessary operations, and increases production through scientific principles such as.\n1. Time study : To determine the time required performing the job in the best possible\nway.\n2. Method Study : To keep the cost of production at the minimum level.\n3. Motion Study : Objects of motion study are.\ni. Studying the movements of operations and machines.\nii. Identifying and eliminating unnecessary and wasteful motions.\n4. Fatigue study : The object of this study is to examine how long a person can perform\nthe standard task without causing any adverse effect on his health and efficiency.\n4.4.3 STANDARDISATION OF TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT :\nAccording to this principle proper tools and equipment are essential for increasing the\nspeed of work.\n4.4.4 SCIENTIFIC SELECTION, PLACEMENT AND TRAINING :\nTaylor wanted a radical change in the methods and procedures of selecting workers. Workers\nshould be selected by considering their education, experience and attitude towards work. The\nplacement of workers should be such that only the most suitable persons are assigned the work.\nPlacement should be on the basis of merit rating. Workers should be given training to make them\nsuitable for the jobs.\nIntroduction of Functional Foremanship :\nTaylor advocated the concept of functional foremanship. He felt that workers and factory\nexecutives should be freed from the burden of \u2018 Planning and Designing \u2019. He suggested eight\nfunctional Specialists, the first four attached with planning work and the next four for the shop\nwork. Centre for Distance Education 4.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\na. Route clerk lay down the sequence of operations.\nb. Instruction card clerk prepares an expert method of doing a work.\nc. Time and cost clerk is to keep records of time spent by different workers on different\njobs.\nd. Shop disciplinarian deals with cases of breach of discipline and absenteeism.\ne. Gang boss is to assemble and set up various equipment and tools.\nf. Speed boss ensures that machinery are run at optimum desired speed.\ng. Repair boss ensures regular cleaning, servicing and repair of machines.\nh. Inspector is to ensure that the workers perform their work as per requirements or\nnot.\nBy dividing the work in this way Taylor wanted to streamline the working of production\ndepartment.\nIntroducing Costing System :\nAs a tool of Scientific Management cost accounting serves the following purposes.\n1. Cost reduction and cost control.\n2. Estimation of costs and preparation of budgets. Principles of Management 4.5 Evolution of Management Thought\n3. Increase efficiency and reduce wastage.\n4. Channelise production on right lines.\nMental Revolution :\nTaylor\u2019s basic idea was to bring change in the mental attitude of workers and management\ntowards each other through scientific approach. Workers were feeling that management was\nexploiting them, getting heavy work and paying meager amounts, whereas management had the\nmisgiving that workers always grumbled about the load of work, follow go- slow policy etc. Mutual\nunderstanding and co-operation between management and workers was an essential aspect\nadvocated by Taylor. It can be achieved through mental revolution.\nAdvantages of Scientific Management :\n1. Wastage can be reduced\n2. Workers abilities are utilized through training\n3. Activities are specialized.\n4. Establishes performance standards\n5. Use of monetary and other incentives for increasing the productivity of worker\u2019s\nCriticism on Scientific Management :\nScientific Management has been criticized due to the following factors :\n1. Taylor\u2019s expectation of efficiency was not possible in an average worker. The standards\nset for workers under time and motion studies were too high.\n2. His emphasis on efficiency at all costs turned workers into mere machines.\n3. The incentives to workers were not commensurate with the increase in productivity.\n4. This approach ignores the average worker, because of tough competition.\n5. Specialisation makes the work repetitive and monotonous.\n6. Taylor concentrated more on problems of factory management and did not touch upon\nthe general management like planning, coordinating and controlling etc.,\nInspite of criticism Taylor\u2019s theory and principles have considerable influence on modern\nmanagement thought.\n4.2.2 OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT THEORY- HENRY FAYOL ( 1841-1925) :\nHenry Fayol started his career as a junior engineer in a coal mine company in France and\nbecame itsGeneral Manager in 1880. He wrote a book titled on \u201c General and IndustrialManagement\n\u201c in 1916 which was published in English in 1949.\nThe contributions of Taylor and others are aimed mostly at workshop level and did not\nconcentrate on the development of overall organisation structure. At about the same time, the real Centre for Distance Education 4.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\ncontributions to the promotion of management at the organization level are given by Fayol that is\nwhy he is known as Father of Modern Operational Management.\nHenry Fayol observed that management was an activity common to all human undertakings\nwhether in the home, business, Government. He divided all activities of a business enterprise into\nsix categories.\na. Technical activities \u2013 production.\nb. Commercial activities \u2013 buying, selling.\nc. Financial activities \u2013 search for and optimum use of capital.\nd. Security activities \u2013 protection of property and persons.\ne. Accounting activities \u2013 including statistics.\nf. Managerial activities.\nFunctions of Management :\nFayol used the term 'administration' instead of 'management' . He divided the key functions\nof administration into five sub groups such as \u2013\nPlanning - to forecast and provide means for the future.\nOrganising \u2013 provides everything useful to its functioning.\nCo-ordinating \u2013 binding together, unifying and harmonizing all activities.\nCommanding \u2013 leads the personnel in a better way.\nControlling \u2013 ensuring every thing goes as per plans.\nGeneral Principles of Management\nFayol has provided fourteen principles to manage the organisation successfully and to\nbuild up an effective organisational structure. They are enumerated as follows \u2013\n1. The Division of work \u2013 The work is divided into parts, and one person does only\none things rather than doing every thing himself. It is to be adopted to take advantages\nof specialization. It gives maximum productivity and efficiency.\n2. Parity between Authority and Responsibility \u2013 Authority and responsibility go side\nby side and should be commensurate to each other.\n3. Discipline \u2013 Discipline is in essence. It refers to respect for agreements which are\ndirected at achievements, obedience, energy and respect.\n4. Unity of Command \u2013 One person should receive order from one superior only. There\nshould not be multiple bosses to one subordinate because it will lead to division of\nresponsibility and escapism.\n5. Unity of Direction \u2013 Fayol observed without unity of direction, unity of action, Co-\nordination of strength and focusing of effort cannot be achieved. According to this Principles of Management 4.7 Evolution of Management Thought\nprinciple, each group of activities with the same objective must have one head and\none plan.\n6. Subordination of Individual interest to general interest \u2013 Management should\nmake efforts to reconcile individual interests with common interests must be sacrificed\nto common interest, if there is a conflict between these two.\n7. Fair remuneration \u2013 Fayol wanted the remuneration to be paid to employees to be\nfair and equitable to provide the maximum possible satisfaction to employees and\nemployer.\n8. Centralisation - It refers to concentration of authority in the hands of few i.e., top\nmanagement. There must be good balance between centralization and\ndecentralization of authority.\n9. Scalar Chain \u2013 Fayol was of the opinion that a hierarchie channel called scalar chain\nis necessary to ensure unity of command and effective communication. Scalar chain\nis a chain of superiors and subordinates from the highest ranks to the lowest ranks.\nCommand and Communication must go through this chain.\n10. Order \u2013 It means the right man in the right job and right material in the right place.\n11. Equity - Fayol was of the opinion that to encourage workers to fulfil their duties with\ndevotion and loyalty, management should deal with workers with equity- based on\nkindness and justice.\n12. Stability of tenure \u2013 It means the long term existence of people in the organisation.\nFayol felt that instability of personnel is both the cause and effect of bad management\nso these should be a stability in tenure.\n13. Initivative \u2013 Initiative is regarded as thinking out and execution of a plan. Employees\nshould be given the chance and opportunity in taking initiative in deciding and\nimplementing the plans.\n14. Esprit do corps \u2013 It refers to harmony and mutual understanding among the members\nof the organization.\nAccording to Fayol, manager should require the following qualities \u2013\nI. Physical health\nII. Vigour\nIII. Mental ability\nIV. Moral energy\nV. Firmness\nVI. Willingness to accept responsibility.\nVII. Educational qualifications.\nVIII. Technical qualifications.\nIX. Experience. Centre for Distance Education 4.8 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nHe recongnized the need for principles of management, techniques, managerial ability for\nefficient management. Management theory has universal validity even though management\npractices may vary according to socio - economic environment and culture. So Fayol\u2019s principles\nof management have universal applicability.\n4.2.3 BARNARD AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS THEORY :\nThe contributions of Chester Barnard to the management are over whelming. His book \u201c\nThe Functions of the Executive \u201c is regarded as the most influential book on the management\nduring the pre- modern management era. His analysis of management is truly a social systems\napproach. In determining the tasks of executives, he has analysed the nature of cooperative social\nsystems, as he found non- logical factors also influencing human behaviour in the organisation.\nThe major contributions of Barnard can be presented as follows :\n1. Concept of Organisation : Barnard suggests that classical concept of organization\ndoes not fully explain the features of an organization. He has defined formal organization,\nas a system consciously coordinated activities or courses of two or more persons. He\nopined organization, exists in the following conditions -\ni. There are persons able to communicate with each other.\nii. They are willing to contribute to the action.\nii. They attempt to accomplish a common purpose.\n2. Formal and informal Organisations - Bernard suggested that executives should\nencourage the development of informal organisation, to serve as a means of\ncommunication, to bring cohesion in the organisation, and to protect the individuals\nfrom dominance and on slaught of the organization. Both the formal and the informal\norganisations, depend on each other and there is continuous interaction between the\ntwo. Therefore in managing an organization, managers should take into account both\ntypes of organisation.\n3. Elements of Organisation \u2013 According to Barnard, there are four elements of a formal\norganisation they are \u2013\n1. a system of functionalisation so that people can specialize.\n2. a system of effective and efficient incentives to induce people to contribute\nto group action.\n3. a system of power which will lead group members to accept the decisions\nof the executives and.\n4. a system of logical decision making.\n4. Authority \u2013 Barnard does not agree with the classical view that authority transcends\nfrom the top to bottom. He has given a new concept of authority known as \u201c acceptance\ntheory of authority \u201c or \u201c bottom \u2013up authority \u201c. In his opinion, a person does not obey\nan order because it has been given by a superior but he will accept a communication\nas being authoritative. Principles of Management 4.9 Evolution of Management Thought\n5. Functions of the executive \u2013 Barnard has identified three types of functions which\nan executive performs in a formal organisation.\nThese are \u2013\ni. maintenance or organizational communication through formal interactions.\nii. the securing of essential services from individuals to achieve organizational\npurpose.\niii. the formulation and definition of organizational purpose.\n6. Motivation - Apart from financial incentives Barnard has suggested a number of non\n- financial techniques for motivating people these are \u2013.\ni. Opportunity of power and distinction.\nii. Pride of workmanship.\niii. Pleasant organization.\niv. Mutual supporting and personal attitudes.\nv. Feeling of belongingness.\n7. Executive Effectiveness - High order of responsible leadership makes the executive\neffective. Executive leadership demands high caliber, technological competence, and\ntechnical and social skills.\n8. Organisational Equilibrium - Organisational equilibrium refers to the matching of\nindividual efforts and organisational efforts to satisfy individuals. This equilibrium is not\nstatic but dynamic. The equilibrium of the organization, depends on the individuals\nworking is, in it, other organizations and the changes in the society. Thus Barnard\ncontribution show how he was concerned for the development of the organization through\nsocial systems.\n4.2.4 CONTRIBUTION OF PETER F. DRUCKER :\nAmong the contemporary management thinkers, peters F. Drucker was legend in the field\nof management. He has made may outstanding contributions to the development of management\nprinciples. Following are some of his views on management.\n1. Nature of Management : According to Durcker the basic objective of management is\nto lead towards innovation. He advocates that management is creative and innovative\nin nature rather than bureaucratic. Because managers practice their activities in an\never changing environment, they always deal with the human beings whose behaviour\nis complex and unpredictable. He was warned that too much professionalisation of\nmanagement is dangerous. He has also emphasized that managers should not only\nhave skills and techniques but should have right perspective putting the things into\npractice. Centre for Distance Education 4.10 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n2. Management By Objectives : ( MBO) Mangement By Objectives is regarded as one\nof the most important contributions of Drucker to the discipline of management. He\nintroduced this concept in 1954. It is regarded to be his remarkable contribution to the\nmanagement thought. It consists of environmental scanning, identification of key result\nareas, setting objectives for departments as well as to subrondinates, motivation and\nperformance appraisal. He opines that MBO is a management Philosophy rather than\na management technique.\n3. Management Functions : According to Drucker, management is the organ of its\ninstitution. He sees management through its tasks. Drucker has attached great\nimportance to the objective setting function and has specified eight areas where clear\nobjective setting is remained. These are market standing, innovation, productivity,\nphysical and financial resources, profitability, managerial performance and development,\nworker performance and attitude and public responsibility.\n4. Organisation Structure : Drucker always advocates for the parallel growth of second\nline managers because whenever the existing managers vacate their offices,\norganizations should not suffer form the non- availability of experienced managers, if\nthere is gap, it is determental to the performance of the organization.\n5. Organisation Changes : Futher Drucker has forecasted that organizations face many\nchanges because of rapid social and technological changes. Hence dynamic\norganization structures are essential than static and bureaucratic structures.\n6. Federalism : Federalism means centralization of control and decision making in\ndecentralized structure. Drucker has felt the need for close links between the decisions\nadopted by the top management on the one hand and by autonomous unit on the other\nhand.\n7. Activity Analysis, Decision Analysis and Relation Analysis : In the words of Drucker,\norganization is a means to the end of business performance and business results.The\nfirst question that every manager must ask himself is what is our business and what it\nshould be? Then the organization should be designed to attain the objectives of the\nbusiness.\nThe contributions of Drucker, especially his futurism, objective - orientedness and perception\nof changes stood as hall - marks in the management evolution.\n4.3 SUMMARY :\nThus Taylor\u2019s principles laid emphasis on improving production through control of work\nsituations with the help of scientific techniques such as work study, time study, motion study,\nfatigue study and functional foreman ship etc., Fayol\u2019s principles related to the overall administration\nof the enterprise. Fayol generalized his experience into developing a theory of administration.\nBernard divided organization into two types \u2013 formal, informal. Drucker\u2019s contributing have made\ntremendous impact on the management practices.

According to him, objectives are the ends\nand means of an enterprise, all the activities must be framed and directed to perform objectives\nand no deviations from the achievement of objectives is permitted. There should be a great concern\nand commitment towards objectives throughout the organisations at any level, then only\norganisations can survive. It means organisations are to be managed in such a way to achieve the\nobjectives. Hence this concept has gained immense popularity all over the world. In India also, in\nmany organisations, MBO has become the way of management process.\n5.2 CONCEPT :\nMBO is both a philosophy and approach of management. It is a process where by superiors\nand subordinates jointly identify the common objectives, set the results that should be achieved by Centre for Distance Education 5.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nthe subordinates assess the contribution of each individual, and integrate individuals with the\norganisation so as to make best use of organisational resources.\n\u2018 Koontz \u2019 defined MBO as \u2013 \u201c MBO is a comprehensive managerial system that\nintegrates many key managerial activities in a systematic manner consciously directed towards\nthe effective and efficient achievement of organisational objectives \u201c. It emphasizes the importance\nand operation of MBO .\n\u2018S.K. Chakra borthy \u2019 opined \u2013 \u201c MBO is a result- centered, non specialist operational\nmanagerial process for the effective utilisation of material, physical, and human resources of the\norganisation by integrating the individual with the organisation and organisation with the environment.\n5.3 FEATURES OF MBO :\nBased on the definitions of MBO its features can listed out as follows :\na) MBO is an approach and philosophy to management and not merely a technique. It is\nlikely to affect every management practice in the organisation. It employs several\ntechniques but it is not merely the sum total of all these techniques. Thus it is a\nparticular way of thinking about management.\nb) MBO provides the stimulus for the introductions of new techniques of management\nand enhances the relevance and utility of the existing ones.\nc) MBO is the joint application of a number of principles and techniques, and works as\nintegrating device.\nd) The basic emphasis of MBO is on objectives, it tries to match objectives and resources.\ne) This process clarifies the role very sharply in terms of what one is expected to achieve.\nf) Periodic review of performance is an important feature of MBO.\ng) Objectives in MBO provide guidelines for appropriate systems and procedures For\ninstance resource allocation, delegation of authority etc., are determined on the basis\nof objectives.\n5.4 PROCESS OF MBO :\nThe process of management by objectives translates organisational objectives into individual\nobjectives with the commitment and participation of employees. It improves the clarity and balance\nof the objectives and makes rigorous analysis throughout the organisation. Following are the steps\nin MBO process.\na) Establishment of organisational objectives :\nThe first basic step in MBO is the definition of organisational purpose and objectives.\nBasically organisational objectives are to be formulated with the interaction of planning premises.\nPlanning premises refer to the environment in which future plans will operate. The manager has to Principles of Management 5.3 Management by Objectives\nassume the future environment and should set the objectives accordingly. The objectives must be\nmade clear as long term and short term objectives, and corporate and departmental objectives.\nb) Identification of Key Result Areas ( KRAs ) :\nKey result areas refer to departments or divisions or elements or functions of an enterprise\nwhich play a vital role in the achievement of stated objectives. They are to be identified keeping in\nview planning premises and corporate objectives. For example KRAs applicable to most of the\nbusiness organisations are\n\u00d8 Profitability\n\u00d8 Market Standing\n\u00d8 Innovation\n\u00d8 Productivity\n\u00d8 Worker performance\n\u00d8 Resources\n\u00d8 Research & Development\nThe KRAs are not constant, they vary periodically according to changing conditions and demands.\nThey also change from organisation to organisation, depending on its philosophies and\ncharacteristics.\nc) Determination of Subordinates objectives :\nThe organisational objectives are achieved through individuals. Therefore, each individual\nmanager must know in advance what he is expected to achieve. Objectives are to be transluated\ninto superior'sobjectives after designing an appropriate organisation with required authority and\nresponsibility. Then superior attempts to decide subordinates objectives with the participation of\nconcerned subordinate. Because the basic concepts of MBO are interaction and mutual\nacceptance, which increase commitment towards, achievement of objectives.\nd) Matching Resources with Objectives :\nWhen objectives are set carefully, they also indicate the resource requirement. In fact,\nresources availability becomes an important aspect of objective setting, because it is the proper\napplication of resources which ensures objectives achievement. Therefore there should be\nmatching between resources and objectives.\ne) Performance Evaluation :\nAfter establishing the goals of subordinates, their performance can be reviewed periodically\nby the superiors, and necessary corrective measures and assistance may be provided by the\nsuperiors, like the suggestions, quality maintenance, etc., Further, new inputs like training and\ndevelopment, incentives, additional facilities and infrastructure can be furnished in order to see\nthat the final performance must match the objective standards. Centre for Distance Education 5.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nf) Recycling :\nThough appraisal is the last aspect of MBO process, it is used as an input for recycling\nobjectives and other actions. In the MBO process, since all the stages are inter- related, the outcome\nof appraisal at one level is recycled to the higher level to see that objectives are to be performed.\nFor instance when subordinate\u2019s objectives are changed after the consultation, then superior\u2019s\nobjectives are to be redrafted. i.e., either increased or decreased to match subordinates objectives,\nor the organisation structure is to be changed.\nFollowing figure shows the steps in the process of MBO .\n5.5 Benefits or Merits of MBO :\n1. Better Managing :\nMBO helps in better managing the organisational resources and activities. Resources and\nactivities are put in such a way that they result into better performance. MBO tries to improve\nperformance in the five ways.\na. The relationship between clarity of objectives and imporvemnt of performance\nis the cornerstone of MBO Philosophy. Principles of Management 5.5 Management by Objectives\nb. Clarity of roles, including the areas of authority and responsibility, leads to\nimproved performance.\nc. Periodic review provides opportunities for taking stock of the situation and\nplanning future course of action.\nd. Participation by managers in the management process is expected to ensure\nachievement of objectives.\ne. MBO provides a base for the philosophy that there is always scope for improved\nperformance.\nAll these factors for performance improvement are generated if MBO is followed properly.\n2. Clarity in organisational Action :\nMBO tends to provide the key result areas where organisational efforts are needed. For\ninstance A key factor in objective setting is the external environment in which the organisation\noperates. Therefore any change in environmental factors is taken care of at the level of objective\nsetting itself. Thus it provides basis for long range planning in the organisation.\n3. Personnel Satisfaction:\nMBO Provides greatest opportunity for personnel satisfaction. This is possible because of\ntwo closely related phenomena :\ni. Participation in objective setting.\nii. Rational performance appraisal.\nIn fact in many organisations, people do not perform to the level of their potential because\nof absence of there positive factors and often there is high rate of managerial turnover.\n4. Basis for organisational change :\nMBO stimulates organizational change and provides a frame work and guidelines for planned\nchange, enabling the top management to initiate, plan, direct and control the direction and speed\nof change.\n5.6 Problems and Limitations of MBO :\nSome of the common problems of MBO are as follows :\n1. Time & Cost :\nIt is a process which requires large amount of the most scarce resource in the organisation\nand time of the senior managers. Sometimes managers get frustrated and feel overburdened.\n2. Failure to teach MBO Philosophy :\nManagers often fail to understand and appreciate this new approach. MBO demands rigorous\nanalysis as an integral element of the management process but the organisation may not be used\nto rigour. Centre for Distance Education 5.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n3. Problems in Objective Setting :\nSetting of verifiable objectives is difficult atleast in some areas. Objectives are more in the\nform of statement rather than in quantitative form.\n4. Emphasis on short - term objectives :\nSome times , in order to be more precise there is a tendency to emphasise on short-term\nobjectives usually for a year or even less. There is a danger in emphasizing short - term objectives\nat the cost of long terms objectives.\n5. Inflexibility :\nIn a dynamic environment, a particular objective may not be valid for even, in the context of\nrevised objectives, changed premises, it is useless to follow the old objectives. Thus inflexibility\ncreated by applying MBO may cause harms.\n6. Frustration :\nSometimes MBO creates frustration among managers, because it tends to arouse high\nexpectations for rapid change, particularly among the young and junior managers.\nInspite of these obstacles MBO continues to be a way of managing the organisation.\nProblems of MBO can be over come by implementing it properly.\n5.7 PREREQUISITES FOR INSTALLING MBO PROGRAMME :\nSome of the prerequisites for installation of MBO programme are.-\n1. Purpose of MBO should be clearly defined.\n2. Top management support for using objectives to plan and to control is essential.\n3. Systematic training is required in the organisation for disseminating the concepts and\nphilosophy underlying MBO.\n4. Success with MBO requires a commitment on the past of each individual involved in\nthis type of system.\n5. Feedback is an essential ingredient in sustained learning and improvement in situations.\n6. It must be carried all the way down to the first line of the organization .\n5.8 SUMMARY :\nIn this lesson it is attempted to elucidate the process of Managent By Objectives. It is a\nmeans rather than an end. It has to achieve certain things in the organisation, it has to solve some\nproblems.\n5.9 KEY WORDS :\nFlexibility : Ability to change according to changing conditions.\nPeriodic review : Review of work from time to time.

These words are used by different people and often by the some person as it\nthey were all synonymous\nOrganisation is the process so combining the work which individuals or groups have to\nperform with the facilities necessary for its execution that the duties, so formed provide the best\nchannels for the efficient, systematic, positive and co- ordinated application of the available\neffort. Further organisation is a mechanism through which people concerned are made to work\nto achieve the set goals of that enterprise together.\n6.2 ROLE OF MANAGEMENT :\nManagement is a process concerned with planning executing and controlling the activities\nof an enterprise. Managerial behaviour must be goal - directed which results in a succession of\nactivities and events by which the organisation work proceeds. Management is concerned with\nevolving workable plans which are there put into action resulting in certain consequences which\nhave to be observed and evoluated and constantly comparad with the objectives prescribed in the\nplan. This cyclical process can be described as the management process. It is basically concerned\nwith interrelationship of people at work although it has its base in nonhuman elements , such as\nmachinery technology and physical property. Centre for Distance Education 6.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n6.3 THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS:\nThinking of Management as a process indicates that it is concerned more with directing perfor-\nmance rather than with doing or working directly on products or services, that is, performing non-\nmanagerial work activity must be delegated to non- manager. This should not mean that every\nmanager performs only managerial activities. In actual practice, the manager performs two types\nof work, namely, the doing aspect or non - managerial work and the managing part of his duties .\nFor example, many managers perform he work of interviewing candidates which is a non-\nmanagerial activity. However, from doing to managing often presents an enormous gap.\n6.4 CONCEPT OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION :\nA business undertaking is an institutional arrangement to conduct any type old business activ-\nity. The undertaking may be run by one person or association of persons. It may be based on\nformal or informal agreement among persons who undertake to run the concern. According to\nWheeler, a business undertaking is a concern, company or enterprise which buys and sells, is\nowned by one person or a group of persons and is managed under specific set of operating\npolicies. The persons join to gather and pool their resources and conduct the activities of the\nundertaking for the benefit of all.\n6.5 ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION:\n1. Social Responsibility : The only and one aim of business undertakings is not to increase\nprofits. They own some responsibility to the society also. The society expects business undertak-\ning to provide cheap and better quality goods to consumer. They are also expected to contribute\ntowards social amenities by opening schools, hospitals, parks etc, not only for the employees but\nalso for people lining in those facilities\n2. Profit Motives: All business undertakings are run to earn profits. An undertaking started for\nsocial service will not be called business undertaking because the aim is not earn profit. The\nincentive of earning profit keeps undertaking going. The aim is to get back more than what has\nbeen invested\n3. Dealing in Goods and Services : All business undertakings deal in goods and services. The\ngoods, may be consumer goods or producer`s goods. The consumers goods are those which are\npurchased by them for consumption or day to day use.\n4. Continuity of Transactions : The Trasactions is a business undertaking are continous or\nregular. They are engaged in a series of successive transactions over time and space.\n5.Risk and uncertainity : Every business undertaking is exposed to risks and uncertainties.\nBusiness is influenced by further events and further is always uncertain. There are chances of\nprice fluctuations, demand charges, consumer likings and dislikings etc. There may be fire,\nearthquake, strike by workers etc,. All these factors make a business undertaking risky and uncer-\ntain.\n6.6 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CHOICE OF SUITABLE FORM OF\nORGANISATION:\n1. Nature of business activities: The nature of business is an important factor affecting a Principles of Management 6.3 Role of Management ...\ndecision about the firm or organisation. If a concern deals with local market, a seasonal product\nor perishable goods, then sole-trade business will be suitable. The capital requirements of such\nconcerns will be less and scale of operation will be low.\n2. Relationship between ownership and management: There is a direct relationship between\nownership and management in sole-trade concern and partnership firms. In company form of\norganisation, management and ownership are in two different hands. The owners(Shareholders)\nare spread all over the country and they do not take active interest in the working of the enter-\nprise. Therefore only sole- trade and partnership forms are suitable for above relationship.\n3. Managerial Needs : Managerial and administrative requirements also affect the decision about\nform of organisation. When the concern is small and it caters to local needs only then one person\nwill be enough to manage the business. Sole - proprietorship form of organisation will be suitable\nfor such a business. If business caters to more areas, then more persons will be needed to look\nafter various business functions. When a business is run on a large - scale basis, it will require the\nservices of specialists to manage various departments. The company form of organisation will be\nsuitable for such concerns.\n4. Tax Liability : A joint stock company has more tax liability as compared to a sole - trade\nbusiness and a partnership firm. A company faces double taxation liability. A company is taxed\nas an individual first and the profit distributed to shareholders are again liable for tax as income of\nthe recipients. A partnership concern and a sole-trade business are not separately taxed. A small-\nscale concern will be able to avoid higher tax liability.\n5. Continuity : This is another factor influencing a decision about the form of ownership. If the\nconcern is stable and there is no fear of discontinuity it will attract more investment. The trained\nand qualified persons will like to join the concern. The only company form of organisation is the\nonly form which ensure stability and continuity.\n6. Capital Requirement : The need for capital will depend upon the nature of business and scale\nof operators. A manufacturing concern may require more capital or compared to a retai shop . On\nthe other hand, if scale of operations is large then, capital requirements will also be more. After\ndetermining the capital needs the form of organisation should be selected.\n7.Flexibility : A good form of organisation should also provide for flexibility in its operations.\n8. Easy in formation : The nature and extent of formalities required at the time establishing a\nconcern also influence a decision about the form of organisation.\n9. Liability : In sole - trade and partnership business, the liability of owners is unlimited. In case of\ncompanies the liability of shareholders is limited to the value of shares they have purchased.\n6.7 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF MANAGEMENT:\n1.Planning for Future : Every management thinks and plans about future. The current as well as\nfuture planning go together. The activities to be undertaken in future will be planned at present. No\nconcern can survive if it does not plan for future. The likely business trends, future global trends,\nlikely business laws, changing consumer preferences, impact of social changes are the factors\nwhich will be taken into account while planning for future. Centre for Distance Education 6.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n2.Better Quality Goods : The consumer has become quality conscious now. He will go to for only\nthose products which are of good quality and satisfy his needs. At present, the survival of a unit\nis linked to the quality to products it produces. The objective of the management is to bring out\nquality products so that they are accepted by the market. It will require introduction of quality\nstandards in the business. Management should make efforts to plan production process in such\na way that only quality products are produced and marketed.\n3. Proper utilisation of Resources: Every management aims to utilise enterprise resources\nproperly and economically. The proper use of men, materials and machinary will ensure reason-\nable cost and adequate profits. It is not only the management which will look towards business\nprofits but other interest groups such as employees, shareholders, customer, government will\nalso be affected by its quantum. The efforts of the management should be to make optimum use\nof available resources in order to achieve better results.\n4.Growth and Development of Business: Managerial efforts to be expand and diversity the busi-\nness. It there is a scope to expand the existing business then efforts should be made to develop it\nbut avenues to enter new avenues should also be explored. It will give stability and strength to the\nbusiness.\n5.Mobilising best talent : The management should try to employ proper persons in various\nfields so that better results are possible. The employment of specialists in various fields will be\nincreasing the efficiency of various factors of production. There should be proper environment\nwhich should encourage good person`s to join the enterprise. Better pay, scales, proper ameni-\nties, future growth potentialities will attract more people in joining the concern.\n6.Promotion of Research : The greatest drawback in India business is its lack luster approach\ntowards research. Management give hardly any importance to research activities. It restrict\ntheir strength and capacity to compete in the market. There is a need to keep ourself aware of\nwhat is going on in the market and prepare to face it. The promotion of research is the only\nanswer at present. Management should always try to get benefits of latest technological changes\nand ready to face the future with conference and zeal.\n7.Minimising risk element: Every business at present is facing global competition. The prod-\nucts from developed countries are flooding markets in India. There is a need to improve overall\nworking for staying in such a competition. The management should plan the activities in such a\nway that business is able to survive, under uncertain conditions. There is a need to minimising\nrisk element and also to explore newer and better avenues.\n6.8 MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES :\nFrom the goals at management , it is clear that management consists of getting things done\nthrough others by directing their efforts in an integrated and co-ordinated manner in order to\nattain business activities. It consists of resources. It consists of all organisational activities that\ninvolve goal formation and accomplishment, performance appraisal and the development of an\noperating philosophy that ensures organisational survival. An analysis of the above things the\nmanagement indicates the following activities.\n1.Management is an activity: It is a process of organisational activity which is concerned with\nthe efficient use of resources of production. Resources include material, money and people in the\norganisation. Principles of Management 6.5 Role of Management ...\n2.It is a purposeful activity: It is a concerned with the achievement of an objectivity through its\nfunctions such as planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling. Objectives may be ex-\nplicitly defined or implicit.\n3.It co-ordinates all activities and resources: It is concerned with the co-ordination of all\nactivities and resources through its various functions to attain the state objectives.\n4.It is a universal activity : Managers, irrespective of the enterprise in which they are working\nand their place in the organisation structure, make use of the management principles. It means\nthat the techniques and tools of management are universally applicable.\n8.It is an integrating activity: It integrates men, machines and material for carrying out the\noperations of an enterprise and for achieving the stated objectives. It is said that the task of\nbusiness management is the responsibility for welding into a single working force the three\nfactors men \u2013men, method and machinery.\n9.It is a profession : Gradually, it is becoming a profession because there are established prin-\nciples of management which are being applied in practice.\n6.9 SUMMARY:\n1. The concept of management has become universal and no organisation can survive without\nit. Management consists of getting things done through other by directing their efforts in an\nintegrated and co-ordinated manner for achieving the business objectives.\n2.

Not only\nshould this information be made available, but it must be made available quickly. The right\ninformation at the right time reduces the risk of wrong decisions. The proper collection, handling\nand providing the necessary information to the right manager as soon as possible could be a\ntremendous boon to the control function.\n8.17 FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION RESOURCE MANAGER:\nThe information resource manager has been performing the following functions in an\nenterprise\n1.

This information will be used for decision making. Even though,\nwill this information center, the managers themselves sort out the facts in order to formulate\ninformation , as against the information being given to them by their subordinates, the basic\nphilosophy of MIS remains the same.\n8.18 SUMMARY:\nA manager\u2019s job is highly crucial to the success of any organisation.

Planning\nis the first management function. Before any action is taken place, it is essential to think about\nplanning and design the future course of action, otherwise functioning would be ambiguous and\nperformance of the organisation could not be upto the level of desired standards.\n9.2 MEANING OF PLANNING :\nEvery human activity undertaken with a view to achieve something must be proceded by\nplanning. For instance, a student desirous of securing a good grade in the examination has to\nplan his study. A person intending to set up a business cannot do so unless he has done a lot of\nprevious thinking. He has to plan within the available resources, the location, the products to be\nsold, customers to be approached or the markets to be entered.\nManagerial operations must be based on suitable and sufficient planning. It has to plan\nnot only in the beginning but throughout the operations.\nDefinitions :\n\u201c Planning is deciding in advance what is to be done\u201d\n\u201cPlanning bridges the gap between where we are to where we want to go\u201d.\n\u201cPlanning will involve deciding a course of action from amongst a number of alternative courses\nwhich would help the enterprise to achieve its objectives most expeditiously and economically.\n\u201cPlanning ensures proper application of resources for the attainment of desired ends\u201d Centre for Distance Education 9.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n9.3 CONCEPT OF PLANNING :\nPlanning is not only the first function of management, it is an integral part of it.\nP- Planning\nO- Organisng\nS- Staffing\nD- Directing\nC- Controlling\nTo plan is to look ahead and chart out the future course of operations. It is the determinant of a\ncourse of action to achieve a desired result. It is one of the corner stones upon which success-\nful enterprise depends. Planning is meant for the following\n1. For the analysis of a problem\n2. Thinking out the forward solutions to that problem\n3. outlining the steps that must be taken to reach the objectives.\nA planner has to think about the following aspects.\na. What is to be done ?\nb. How it is to be done ?\nc. When it is to be done?\nd. By Whom is it to be done?\ne.

Stages in Planning\n9.4 PRINCIPLES OF PLANNING:\n(A) Principle of contribution to objectives : Both major and derivative plans are prepared to\ncontribute to the objectives of the enterprise. Planning is used as a means to reach the goals.\n(B) Principle of Primacy of Planning : This principle states that planning is first or primary\nfunction of every manager. Other managerial functions are organised to reach the objectives\nset in planning.\n(C) Principle of Planning Premises :This principle lays emphasis on properly analysing the\nsituation which is going to Practise in future. In order to make planning effective, some pre-\nsumptions have to be made on the basis of which planning has to be undertaken.\n(D) Principle of Alternatives : Planning process involves developing of many alternatives and\nthen selecting one which will help in achieving desired business goals . Principles of Management 9.3 Planning\n(E) Principle of Timing : Planning premises and policies are useful with proper timing\n(F) Principle of Flexibility : This principle suggests flexibility in plans if some contingencies\narise. The plans should be adjusted to incorporate new situations.\n(G) Principle of Commitment : There should be a time frame for meeting the commitments\nmade. This will ensure achieving of targets in time.\n(H) Principle of Competitive Strategies : while formulating own plans a manager should\nkeep in mind the plans of competitors. The plans should be framed by thinking of what the\ncompetitors will do in similar situations.\n9.5 PLANNING PROCESS:\nPlanning can be accomplished in a series of steps, it is called as planning process. It\nstarts from perception of opportunities to realisation of opportunities. It determines the future\ncourse of action for utilizing resources in the best possible manner to get optimum possible\nresults. The various steps in planning process are described below.\nAwareness of Opportunities Evaluating Alternatives\nEstablishing Objectives Selecting appropriate\nalternative\nConsidering Planning Premises\nFormulating\nDerivative Plans\nIdentifying Alternatives\nBudgeting\nFigure 9.2: Steps in Planning\nSTEPS IN PLANNING PROCESS:\ni) Awareness of opportunities : while planning basically managers are needed to know the\navailability of opportunities to the organisation. Opportunities are available from environment. The\nnew project can be had from changing needs of customers, technological changes, competitors\nweaknesses and innovative patterns of the organisation. Awareness of opportunities involves\npreliminary understanding and estimation of opportunities and analysing them in the light of\nstrengths and weakness of the organisation for the purpose of assuming them. When the manag-\ners are utilising the opportunities, they should be free from threats.\nii)Establishing Objectives : The second step in planning is to setup objectives for the enterprise\nas a whole, and for the departments and individuals. Objectives are to be set for the long run as\nwell as for the short run. These are the end points for managerial course of action and they are\nthe destination for all the activities. Objectives specify the expected results and show how the\ndestination is to be achieved and where emphasis is to be placed. Centre for Distance Education 9.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nObjectives of enterprise are to be translated into departmental objectives, and depart-\nmental objectives are to be converted into individual goals. Then only overall objectives for which\nthe organisation is established can be achieved. Enterprise objectives give direction to major\nplans, in turn they are used to setup objectives for lower levels. Objectives appear in different\nforms, they are mission, overall objectives, divisional objectives, departmental objectives and indi-\nvidual objectives etc.\niii) Planning Premises : Once the objectives are determined the next step is establishing the\nplanning premises. planning premises refer to the environmental conditions or surrounding cir-\ncumstances in which plans work. Plans will operate in future, hence it is appropriate to expect\nfuture conditions and should plan accordingly.\niv) Identifying the Alternatives : In order to achieve the objectives under expected conditions\nmanagers first must identify various alternative courses of action. For instance, to achieve the\nobjectives of securing desired profits, necessary plant and machinery should be established in the\norganisation. The machinery can be of different types like -\nmanual plant\nsemi automatic plant,\ncomplete automatic plant.\nThese are known as alternatives. While developing the alternatives, organisational frame\nwork like constraint of capital, manpower and philosophies may be taken into account.\nv) Evaluating the Alternatives : After identifying the alternatives, the following stage is to evalu-\nate their advantages and disadvantages. Their evaluation should be done in the light of the enter-\nprise objectives.\nvi) Selecting a Course of Action : Choice of a particular alternative is the next step after\nevolution. Evaluation explains the merits and demerits. Selection is the real point of decision mak-\ning. At any time, it is confirmed that selection of two or more alternatives is better than choosing\nonly one alternative. Hence managers should plan in such a manner to select right combination.\nvii) Formulating Derivative Plans :The departmental plans are known as Derivative plans. For\ninstance, in order to generate desired profits for the organisation, production department should\nhave production plans regarding number and quality of units to be produced.\nviii) Budgeting : A budget is forecasted statement of revenue and expenditure, it is a numberised\nplan. It allocates the various resources to the required activities keeping in view of objectives.The\norganisation and each department working in it can have their own budget. Hence, budgeting is\nthe last stage of planning which puts the plan into action.\nThe planning sequence discussed above, is almost similar to all the managers but may\ndiffer according to the complexity and time duration of plans like some steps may be prolonged\nand some stages may be shortened. Future plans must be cost-effective. Thus, proper planning\nshould be done keeping in view the circumstance, the need, the magnitude and the level of\ncommitment.\n9.6 TECHNIQUES OF PLANNING :\nPlanning will be useful only when it is effectively implemented. The following techniques makes\nthe planning effective.\n1.Consciousness for Planning : Planning will be effective only when there is a proper climate\nfor it. The superiors should try to set objectives, review various goals and redraft them as is\nrequired for their effective implantation. The hurdles in the ways of planning should be removed.\nEvery body should extend willing and co-operation for making the plans successful.\n2. Initiative at top level: The initiative and support of top level management is essential for Principles of Management 9.5 Planning\nmaking the plans effective. The involvement of lower level management is also essential be-\ncause execution will be more at these levels.\n3. Proper communication : Communication among different levels in the organisation is very\nessential. If plans are not properly understood by those who are to implement them then these\nmay not achieve the desired results. Communication provides a channel for the exchange of\ninformation among various persons. Without a proper communication system planning is bound\nto fail.\n4. Participation in planning : The method and extent of participation will depend upon the type of\norganisation participation of persons at different levels may help in proper implementation of\nplans.\n5. Emphasis on planning : Both long term and short term plans should get proper emphasis. For\neffective implementation of planning both long- term and short-term plans should be given on\nequal weightage.\n6. Timing : Since the planning process is complex of any major and derivative plans and since\nplans are necessarily related to one another, it is important that they fit together, not only in\nterms of content and action, but also in terms of timings.\n9.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF PLANNING :\n1. Minimises uncertainity : Planning certainly minimises future uncertainties by basing its deci-\nsions on past experiences and present situations.\n2. Better utilisation of resources : All the resources are first identified and then operations are\nplanned. All resources are put to best possible uses.\n3. Economy in operation : The operations selected being better among possible alternatives,\nthere is an economy in operations.\n4. Better co-ordination: Planning will lead to better co-ordination in the organisation which will\nultimately lead to better results.\n5.Encourage innovation : Planning helps innovative and creative thinking among managers be-\ncause they will think of many new things while planning.\n6. Planning makes control possible : Control cannot be exercised without planning. With the\nhelp of planning the actual output can be compared the desired one, difference is acquired and\nreasons are located to get necessary action towards unfavaurable differences .\n7. Planning helps motivation : The manager cannot only verify but can encourage workers to\nattain the targets. When tangible goals are insight it is easier to encourage the workers to reach\nthose levels.\n8. Planning ensures against failures and setbacks: Planning is based on estimates. It is an\neffort to visualise the future and attain goals through present action.\n9. Management by exception possible : Planning fixes objectives of the organisation and all\nefforts should be made to achieve these objectives. Management should interfere in other as-\npects only when things are not going well. Thus by the introduction of management by exception,\nmanagers are given more time for planning. The objectives rather than wasting their time in\ndirecting day-to-day work.\n9.8 LIMITATIONS OF PLANNING:\nDespite of many advantages of planning there may be some obstacles and limitations in\nthis process. The follow are some of the limitations of planning.\n1. Lack of Reliable data: Planning is based on various facts and figures supplied to the planners,\nwhich are difficult to procure absence of accurate data will upset the plan. Centre for Distance Education 9.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n2. Expensive: Planning is an expensive process. The gathering of information and testing of\nvarious courses of action, setting up the planning machinery, require huge amount of money.\nSmall companies can not afford to prepare plans.\n3. Time consuming exercise: As planning involves a number of steps, a lot of time has to be\ndevoted to plan before actual operations start.\n4. Lack of workers initiatives : Under planning exercise worker has to act only mechanically.\nIt robs him of his interest in the work .\n5. External factors may reduce utility : Besides internal factors, there are external factors to\nwhich adversely affect planning. These factors may be economic, social, political, technological or\nlegal.\n6.Psychological hurdle : Human psychology also to an extent, places some hurdles in the suc-\ncess of planning. There is a certain degree of conservatism in people which implies resistance\nto change.\n7. Sudden emergencies : In case certain emergencies arise then the need of the hour is quick\naction and not advance planning. These situations may not be anticipated.\n9.9 SUMMARY :\nThus in the context of management, planning is the function of forecasting, framing of the\nobjectives, policies, procedures, schedules, budgets etc,. It involves the consideration of all\nanticipated problems and a future course of action. Planning basically makes a choice from a\nnumber of alternative courses of action.\n9.10 SELF- ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS :\n1. Define planning, what are the Principles of Planning ?\n2.

The probelm before management is to obtain\ngreatest possible orderly functioning with the help of people, who have diverse qualifications. This\nwill help to build a coordinated and integrated approach to the objectives. The aims of organisation\nare optimum use of human skills and efforts, coordination of human effort, defining individual roles in\nthe enterprise, to achieve orderly and smooth functioning. These aims are achieved through the\nprinciples of organisation.\n11.2 DEFINITION OF ORGANISING\nAlmost any business managers will affirm that sound organisation is highly important to business\nsuccess. Many will characterise organisation as the foundation upon which the whole structure of\nmanagement is built. Organisation is understood as a dynamic process and a managerial activity\nwhich is necessary for bringing people together and trying them together in the pursuit of common\nobjectives.\nOrganisation also refers to the structure of relationships among positions and jobs which is built up\nfor the realisation of common objectives. In this, the static sense of the term, organising is the vehicle\nthrough which goals are sought to be attained. The organisation structure is viewed differently by\nvarious authors. Centre for Distance Education 11.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n* Some regard it \u201cas a network of relationships, a blue-print of how the management will like the\nvarious functions and activities to be assigned and connected together\u201d.\n* Some others look upon it \u201cas a social system, consisting of the human relationships existing among\npeople performing different activities\u201d.\n* Some other authors say \u201can organisation is a system with inputs and processes through which\nthese are converted into outputs.\n* Organisation can be defined \u201cas the process of identifying and grouping the work to be performed,\ndefining and delegating responsibility and authority and establishing relationships for the purpose of\nenabling people to work most effectively together in accomplishing objectives.\n* \u2018Wheeler\u2019 defined organisation as \u201cInternal organisation is the structural framework of duties and\nresponsibilities required of personal in performing various functions within the company. It is essentially\na blue print for action resulting in a mechanism for carrying out functions to achieve the goals setup\nby company management\u201d.\n\u2018Koontz and O \u2019Donnell\u2019 opined - \u201corganising involves the establishment of an intentional structure\nof roles through determination of the activities required to achieve the goals of an enterprise and\neach part of it, the grouping of these activities, the assignment of such groups of activities to a\nmanager. The delegation of authority to carry them out, and provision for co-ordination of authority\nand informal relationships horizontally and vertically in the organisation structure\u201d.\n11.3 CONCEPT OF ORGANISATION\nIt is the purpose of an organisation to make common men do uncommon things\u201d - this phrasing is\nLord Beveridge\u2019s. It is the test of an organisation that it make ordinary human beings perform better\nthan they are capable of, that it bring out whatever strength there is in its members and use it to make\nall the other members perform more and better. It is the test of an organisation that it neutralize the\nweaknesses of its members. In this concept following factors help to the management.\n1) Division of labour: The total work considered necessary for the realisation of common objectives\nis divided into activities and functions. Such division is essential because the work is too much for\nany single individual. In a business organisation the work is divided according to functions like -\n* Production\n* Marketing\n* Finance\n* Personnel etc.,\n2) Co-ordination: The divided work for purposes of realising common goals, it becomes necessary\nto link up the various divisions, or activities so that all of them are unified and harmonised.\n3) Accomplishment of goals or objectives: An organisation structure is built up around certain\nclear cut goals or objectives, because it is the ideal way of making a rational pursuit of objectives. Centre for Distance Education 11.3 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n4) Authority & Responsibility: An organisation structure consists of various positions arranged in a\nhierarchy with a clear definition of the authority and responsibility associated with each of these.\n11.4 ORGANISATION STRUCTURE\nThe following diagram shows both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the organisation structure.\nIt gives the levels of management and the line executives in descending order.\n&\no r\nct\ne\nDir\ngin g er\na\nTop Level Management M a n a M a n g\nal\ner\nn\ne\nG\nDevelopmental Heads\nMiddle Level Management\n&\nsuperintendents\nLower Level Management Fore mens\n&\nFirst line\nsupervisors\n- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -W - -o r -k -e -r s - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- --\nFig. 11.1 Organisation structure\n11.4.1 Principles of Organisation structure\nOrganisation theorists developed certain principles of organisation as guides to thinking in organising.\nThese principles are intended for universal application to all enterprises and cooperative efforts in\ndifferent fields. The most important of these principles can be listed under the following heads.\n(i) Division of Labour or Specialisation: F.W. Taylor applied Division of Labour principle at the\noperation level and displayed how efficiency could be increased by breaking down jobs into single\nrepetitive tasks performed on specialised tools.\n(ii) Consideration of Objectives: Objectives are helpful in determining the activities and the structure\nitself. Once objectives are clearly defined, the organiser can conveniently proceed to group activities,\ndelegate authority to individuals to whom activities have been assigned, and coordinate their efforts\nfor better results.\n(iii) The Scalar Principle: The vertical dimension of organisation structure consists of levels of\nauthroity arranged in a hierarchy from the chief executive at the top to the first line supervisor at the Centre for Distance Education 11.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nbottom. Existance of the levels is always the characteristic of organised and coordinated group\nefforts. The scalar principle hold that organisation consists of two or more levels of authority. In\norganisations, the levels represent graduations of distributed authority.\n(iv) The Principle of Departmentation: Logical grasping of related jobs and fucntions is quite natural\nin developing the organisation structure. Departmentation requires analysing everything that has to\nbe done and determining the grouping in which it can be placed without violating the principle of\nhomogeneity. Departmentation is desirable because individuals vary considerably in the range of\nactivities which their ability will permit they to perform effectively.\n(v) The Principle of Unity of Command: A business organisation must have a single head in whom\nall authority and responsibility is concentrated, but this has to be blended with the efforts of the\norganised people below. Unity of efforts, consistency of direction, high morale, and effectiveness of\ncoordination depend upon one executive as the locus of ultimate responsibility.\n(vi) The Principle of Span of Control: The idea of span of control is related to the horizontal dimension\nof an organisation structure. Span of control refers to the number of subordinates reporting directly to\nthe executive, the more difficult it tends to be for him to supervise and coordiante them effectively.\n(vii) The Principle of Flexibility: Organisation is created to accomplish certain goals. Both the\nenvironment and the individuals comprising the organisation are constantly in flux. To cope with\nthese changes and yet reach its objectives, an organisation must be designed with sufficient amount\nof flexibility.\n(viii) The Principle of Balance: This principle implies that each area and function of an enterprise\nshould operate with equal effectiveness in making its allotted contribution to total purpose. The idea\nof balance applies to organisation structures as well as to functions and process.\n(ix) The Principle of Exception: This principle implies that only problem involving unusual matters\nshould be reffered to upward and decided by higher level executives, and that routine problems\nshould be passed on to lower levels and resolved there itself. Exception principle is also the principle\nunderlying delegation of authrotiy.\n(x) The Princple of Decentralisation: One important implication of decentralisation is delegation of\nbroad authority and decisions making power to the semi-autonomous units.\n(xi) The Principle of Simplicity: Simplicity is an appealing objective because it implies economy of\nefforts. It is desirable to consider simplicity of structure in development of an organisation, aiming for\nas clear-cut structure as will permit doing the necessary work efficiently.\n(xii) Combination of Line and Staff Functions: Organisation structures are usually of line, staff\nand function types. Line strcuture is part of every organisation. The staff and functional types are\nmodifications of the line structure. Staff and Functional structures never exist apart from a combination\nwith line strucutre.\nThe above principles are used as guides while designing the organisation structure. Centre for Distance Education 11.5 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n11.5 PROCESS OF ORGANISATION\nThe process of an organisation may be described as the managerial function of organising. The\nmanagerial function of organising consists in making a rational division of work into groups of activities\nand tying together the positions representing grouping of activities so as to achieve well co-ordinatated\nstructure for the accomplishment of work. Following are the various steps involved in this process.\n1. Determination of objectives: The first step of determination of objectives consist in deciding as\nto way the proposed organisation is to be setup and therefore, what will be the nature of the work to\nbe accomplished through the organisation.\n2. Enumeration of activities: The work of an industrial concern may be divided into the following\nmajor functions such as - production, finance, purchases, sales and personnel.\n3. Classification of activities: In the third step activities are classified according to similarities and\ncommon purposes and functions and taking the human and material resources into account.\nFor instance - the various activities connected with production, may be grouped and classified as\nproduction department.\n4. Fitting individuals into Functions: Each person in the group will be given a specific part of the\njob to do and will be made responsible for it. For instance - appointment of workers, foremen,\nsupervisors etc.\n5. Assignment of Authority for action: The manager will have to pass on studied either by a\nresearcher from outside or by someone within the organisation working as a researcher.\n11.6 SIGNIFICANCE\nAn organisation is not merely a chart or a lifeless structure. It comprises people and is the agency\nthrough which management performs the important functions of direction, co-ordination, motivation\nand control and implements the function of planning. Both as a process and as a structure, is important\nas without it no manager can get work done through people. Following are some of the advantages\nof a good organisation.\n1. Helps in optimum utilisation of Technological Innovations: The technological improvements\nare taking place every time and management is required to make use of them to exist in competitive\nworld. The organisation should be flexible to incorporate all new-requirements. There may be also be\na need to delegate new powers for making best utilisation of technological changes.\n2. Helps in administration: A good organisation is an asset to the management. It helps in achieving\norganisation goals through the exercise of effective controls, organisation provides a channel for\nbetter management.\n3. Promotes growth and diversification: Area and activities of a business grow if it has a well knit\norganisation. There will be a need for employing more persons whenever expansion and diversification\ntakes place. A flexible organisational structure will enable the employment of more persons without\ndisturbing the working. Centre for Distance Education 11.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n4. Easy coordination: Every enterprise has a number of departments and sections. There are\nassigned different duties for achieving business objectives. A good organisation will bring an automatic\nco-ordination in the business and obtains team work among the personnel.\n5. Training and Development of Personnel: A clearly defined authority provides a scope for the\nuse of talent. There will be a sufficient scope to try new ideas in improving the working of the\norganisation. A well designed organisational system will provide a sufficient opportunity for the training\nof new trainees and development of existing staff.\n6. Encourages initiative: In a good organisation persons are allowed to try new ideas for improving\nupon their work. Clearly defined work of every person allows them to grow in that sphere.\n7. Better Human Relations: A clearly defined work, authority, responsibility, accountability will enable\nindividuals to work in a free atmosphere. This will give job satisfaction to employees.\n11.7 PROBLEMS OR OBSTACLES IN ORGANISING\n1. Failure to plan properly: It is not unusual to find an enterprise continuing a traditional organisation\nstructure long after its objectives, plans and external environment have changes. Certain managers\nhave not grown with the company or do not fit to current needs. Personnel have a way of coming and\ngoing in an enterprise -through retirement, resignation, promotion or death - which makes organisation\naround them risky and hard to fill adequately. Such mistakes occur when an enterprise fails to plan\nproperly.\n2. Failure to clarify relationships: The failure to clarify organisational relationships, probably more\nthan any other mistakes, accounts for friction, politics and inefficiencies. Since the authority and the\nresponsibility for actions are critical in organisation, lack of clarity or knowledge of the part members\nare to play on an enterprise team. This implies lack of team work.\n3. Failure to delegate Authority: A common complaint in organisation life is that managers are\nreluctant to push decision making down into the organisation.\nUnderdevelopment of managerial experience in the lower levels of organisation give evidence that\nfailing to delegate authority to the proper extent is usually a decided mistake.\n4. Failure to Balance Delegation: Another mistake made in organising is failure to maintain balanced\ndelegation. Some managers in their zeal for decentralization, may take literally the organisational\nbromide to push decision making down in the organisation as far as it will go. Obviously it develops\na system of independent organisation satellites. Managers must not forget that there is some authority\nthey should not delegate.\n5. Confusion of lines of Authority and Information: The problems and costs of levels of organisation\ncan be reduced by opening wide the channels of information.\n6. Authority without Responsibility: A significant cause of mis management is the granting of\nauthority, without exacting responsibility. All those to whom authority is delegated must be willing to\nbe held responsible for their actions. Centre for Distance Education 11.7 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n7. Responsibility without Authority: A common complaint of subordinates is that superiors hold\nthem responsible for results without giving them the authority to accomplish them. It happens where\norganisation lines and duties have been not clearly set forth, and where an organised structure of\nroles is unclear or confused.\n8. Careless application of the staff device: There are many valid reasons for using a staff assistant\nor staff specialist and even building entire advisory departments. However, there is danger that staff\npeople will be used to undermine the authority of the managers they are intended merely to advise.\nThere is an ever-present danger that top managers may surround themselves.\n9. Misuse of Functional Authority: Perhaps even more perilous to good managing are the dangers\nin undefined and unrestricted delegation of functional authority. Functional authority over activities in\nother parts of the organisation.\n10. Multiple subordination: The principal danger of too great proliteration of functional authority\ndelegations is the breakdown of unity of command. Multiple subordination results also from faulty\norganisation structure and from instances of plural executives. It tends to cause confusion undermine\nthe definiteners and effectiveness of authority, and thereaten organisational stability.\n11. Misuse of service Departments: People in line departments, regard a service department as\nrelatively unnecessary, unimportant, and therefore something to be ignored when possible. The\ngreatest misuse of service departments is summed up in the words \u201cefficient inefficiency\u201d. When\nmanagers establish service departments, looking more to their cost savings than to the efficiency of\nthe entire enterprise, a highly \u201cefficient\u201d service may do an inefficient job of serving.\n12. Overorganisation: Over organisation usually results from failure to put into practice the concept\nthat the activity - authority structure of the enterprise is merely a system for efficient performance of\npeople.\n11.9 SUMMARY\nTo conclude, organisation as a process refers to the act while organisation structure refers to the\naccomplished act. It is the process of creating a structure by grouping the activities of an enterprise\nand establishing authority, responsibility and relationship among the specialists for the attainment of\ndefined objectives. It stimulates independent, creative thinking and initiative through well - defined\nareas of work.\n11.10 KEY WORDS\nAuthority : Right or command thought\nResponsibility : Accountability\nDelegation : Empowering to act for another\nBromide : Tiresome person Centre for Distance Education 11.8 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n11.11 SELF ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1) Define organisation and discuss the principles of organisation structure.\n2) Describe the process of organisation\n3) Explain significance and problems of organisation\n11.12 REFERENCE BOOKS\n1) Industrial Organisation & Management - R.K.

The informal organisation refers\nlargely to what people do because they are human personalities - to their actions in terms of needs,\nemotions attitudes not in terms of procedures and regulations. In the Informal Organisation people\nwork together because of their personal likes and dislikes.\n12.2 ORGANISATION\nOrganisation is the activity-authority structure of the enterprise. It is the particular system of\narrangements, the pattern of network of relations, between the various positions in a business\nenterprise. The management determines the structure which they fill, will best serve company needs.\nSound organisational structure is essential to any business because of the following reasons.\n1. The administration of the enterprise is facilitated.\n2. The areas of work for the employees are well-defined, leading to elimination of the over lapping\nand duplication of activities.\n3. Communication between the management and employees becomes easier.\n4. Growth, expansion and diversification become possible with the help of optimum use of\ntechnological improvements through specialisation. The success of an organisation can be ensured better by the following principles.\n1. The objective of the enterprise should be established for determining the activities and the\nstructure itself.\n2. Every part of the organisation should be geared to the achievement of the objectives.\n3. The objectives should be attained at the minimum cost.\n4. An executive should be asked to supervise a reasonable number of subordinates, say six. This\nis known as span of management or control.\n5. The principle of division of work should be followed.\n6. The establishment of responsibility - authority relationship will help in avoiding confusion and\noverlapping.\n7. The line of authority from the chief executive at the top to the first line supervisor at the bottom\nmust be clearly defined [Scalar Principle].\n8. As the management at the higher level, has limited time, only exceptionally complex problems\nshould be referred to them and the routine matters should be dealt with by executives at lower\nlevel [Exception Principle].\n9. Each subordinate should have only one superior.\n10. The authority delegated to subordinates should be adequate to assure their ability to accomplish\nresults expected of them.\nThese main factors should be kept in mind in creating an organization structure. They are -\n1. Unity of Objective: The organisation structure must contribute to the attainment of the goals of\nthe enterprise.\n2. Principle of efficiency: The principle of efficiency demands that the organisation structure should\nhelp the people to meet the objectives with minimum of unsought consequences.\n3. Individual and group satisfaction: The organisation should provide individual and group\nsatisfaction.\n12.3 ORGANISATION - TYPES\nOrganisation structures are two types. They are -\n1. Formal Organisation\n2. Informal Organisation\n12.3.1. Formal Organisation: The position, authority, responsibility and accountability of each level\nare clearly defined in the case of a formal organisation. It prescribes the relationship which exist\namongst the people working in the organisation. This relationship is defined by rules, policies and\nother regulations of the organisation very consciously to enable the people of the enterprise to work\nmost effectively together in accomplishing their objectives.\nThe formal organisation is a more or less arbitrary structure to which the individual must adjust. It\ntells him to do certain things in a specified manner, to obey orders from designated individuals, and\nto work co-operatively with others. Definite limits for the activities of people are set by the formal organisation. Defined responsibilities\nand authority provide relatively fixed fences within which people can develop their own work areas to\nthe maximum without encroaching on the work of others.\nFeatures of Formal Organisation:\n1. Consciously brought into existence for predetermined objectives.\n2. Authority and responsibility are defined.\n3. The line of communication is also formalised.\n4. The relationship of the superior and the subordinates is fixed.\n5. It exists in a written form, and facilitates the determination of objectives and policies according to\ndivision of work.\n12.3.2 Informal Organisation: Informal Organisation arises from the social interaction of people in\nthe organisation. The people cut across formal channels and communicate amongst each other. It is\ndue to friendship, mutual regard, intimacy and closed contact formed with relationship. Thus the\ninformal organisation has no place in the formal organisation chart. It is formed to meet personal\nneeds of the group and acts as an agency of social control. Informal organisation is not established\nby managers formally but arises spontaneously and naturally. For instance the members of a group\nmay start recognising a person as their leader because of his age. Seniority, job-knowledge, information\npersonality strength or skill etc., Thus informal organisation is earned not delegated. It is all-pervasive\nand is found in every enterprise at all levels of the managerial hierarchy.\nIt is very difficult to find a completely formal or a completely informal organisation. The formal managers\nshould try to make use of informal managers for the achievement of goals of the enterprise.\nFeatures of Informal Organisations:\nInformal organizations are characterised by the following features.\n1. It develops spontaneously and is not established by formal managers.\n2. It is based as informal authority attached to the person, and not the position. Informal authority\nis earned and not delegated. This authority under informal organisation largely flows upward\nor horizontally.\n3. Informal organisation represents human tendency to cut across formal channels and\ncommunicate informally with other parts of the enterprise.\n4. People in the informal organisation are influenced by leaders without any formal authortiy.\n5. It is all-pervasive and exists in every enterprise.\n6. Informal organisation is not always destructive though at time it can make the job of managing\nmore difficult. Because of its powerful influence on productivity and job satisfaction, formal\nmanagement will do well to derive benefit from the study of informal organisation.\n7. Informal organisation cannot altogether be abolished. Informal organisation is not created at\nthe will of the formal managers; not the latter can do away with all the social conventions and\ngroup norms. Merits of Informal Organisation:\n1. Informal organisation blend with formal systems to make a workable system for getting work\ndone. Many requirements which cannot be met with formal organisation can be met better by\ninformal relations.\n2. An informal organisation lightens the workload of the formal manager. If the employee know\nthat their manager has the support of the existing informal organisation, they are more likely\nto respond to his ideas, to be motivated to work efficiently.\n3. A significant benefit of informal organisation is that it gives satisfaction and stability to work\ngroup. It is the means by which workers achieve a sense of belongingness and security.\n4. It is a useful channel of employee Communication. Management often depends on informal\nsystem to convey certain types of information.\n5. Presence of informal organisation encourages a manager to plan and act more carefully than\nhe would otherwise.\nDrawbacks:\nInformal organisations create a major danger or difficulty which require careful attention on the part\nof management.\n1. Resistance to Change: With the persistence of certain culture, these develops a tendency to\nperpetuate the \u2018status quo\u2019 and oppose change.\n2. Role Conflict: What is good for the employee is not always good for his employer. Hence a role\nconflict occurs.\n3. Rumour: Communication leads to rumour. Rumour is a dangerous disease that sweeps through\nan organization as fast as wild fire, and usually with as much damage.\n4. Conformity: Social control exerts strong pressures for conformity under formal organisation. But\nconformity is caused as much by informal organisation.\nControl of Informal Organisation:\nOrganisation should be viewed as a positive force. Informal organisation lightens the burden of\nformal managers. It helps to fill in the gaps in formal orders and managers abilities, provides for\nsatisfaction and stability to the workmen. However, benefits of informal organisation will accrue only\nwhen it is properly controlled and its potential power properly channelised. the significant aspects of\nmanager\u2019s duty in this connection are:\n1. He should recognise and reconcile himself to the existence of informal organisation.\n2. He should influence the informal organization, so that its role is positive and the negative\naspect is minimised.\n3. He should integrate informal organisation, with formal organisation, in such a way that the\nformer also contributes to the accomplishment of enterprise objectives.\n4. He should make informal organisation, secondary to formal organisation. 12.4 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL\nORGANISATIONS\nThe formal and informal groups differ considerably and the major differences can be analysed as\nfollows.\nFormal Organisation Informal Organisation\n1.

Therefore, they\npurpose is served the groups are can not be abolished by management action\nabolished by hte organisational action. though such groups may affect the\norganisational functions adversely.\n12.5 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL\nORGANISATIONS\nFormal and Informal organisations are the parts of the total organisation and therefore, it can be said\nthat they are two sides of the same coin. The following points shows the relationship between these\ntwo groups. 1. It is difficult to find a completely formal or a completely informal organisation.\n2. The managerial functions are performed in both-formal and informal organisations.\n3. If fact many times the informal organisation can prove to be important mechanism of proper\neffective functioning of formal organisation.\n4. The formal organisation may facilitate informal association in several ways such as people\nwork close to each other.\n12.6 SUMMARY\nThus, in the case of formal organisation the position, authority, responsibility and accountability of\neach level are clearly defined. It prescribes the relationship which exist amongst the people working\nin the organization. On the other hand, informal organization arises from the social interaction of\npeople in the organization. The two types of organizations differ in some aspects and have relationship\nis some other aspects. Infact informal organization is a supplement to the formal organization.\n12.7 KEY WORDS\nOrganisation : Designing the roles\nSpan of Management : The number of Subordinates required under the control of a Manager.\n12.8 SELF ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1.

Further, focussed on departmentation types of departmentation, advantages\nand disadvantages of departmentation.\nStructure\n13.1 Introduction\n13.2 Organisational Design\n13.3 Factors of Organisational Design\n13.4 Organisational Processes\n13.5 Organisational Structure\n13.6 Departmentation - Definitions - Scope and Importance\n13.7 Types of Departmentation - Advantages and Disadvantages\n13.8 Summary\n13.9 Technical Terms\n13.10 Self Assessment Questions\n13.11 Reference Books\n13.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe classical design has been in existence since the earliest management days and has been\nsupported by such stalwarts as Henri Fayol, Fredrick Taylor and Lyndall Urwick. The classical\ndesign is highly structured in a hierarchial system of superior and subordinates in the form of a\npyramid. It is a system of complex mechanisms, rules, regulations, and procedures that are highly\ndisciplinary in nature and the responsibilities of personnel are exploined by their positions in the\nhierarchy. Moreover, the departmentation is the process of grouping various activities into separate\nunits of departments. A department is a distinct section of the business establishment concerned\nwith a particular group of business activities of like nature.\n13.2 ORGANISATIONAL DESIGN\nThe classical organisation design has been in existence since the earliest management days and\nhas been supported by such stalwarts at Henri Fayol, Fredrick Taylor, Lyndall Urwick. The classical\ndesign is highly structured in a hierarchial system of superior and subordinates in the form of a\npyramid. It is a system of complex mechanisms, rules, regulations, and procedures that are highly\ndisciplinary in nature and the responsibilities of personnel are explained by their positions in the\nhierarchy. Approaches: This approach has been critically attacked by the exponents of behavioural sciences\nas being overly mechanical and ignores the human aspects. The proponents of this approach like\nElton Mayo, Mary Parker Follet, Chester Barnard, Douglas Mc Gregor etc. suggest that there\nshould be less emphasis on hierarchy and more participation of lower ranks in the decision making\nprocess. The structure should be less formal and more democratic.\nIn recent years a new type of organisation is coming into focus, which is much more informal\nin nature with a minimum of formal division of duties and is known as the \u201corganic structure\u201d. It\ndeemphasizes authority and concentrates on problem solving.\n13.3 FACTORS OF ORGANISATIONAL DESIGN\nSome of the factors to be considered in designing an operational and effective organisation are:\n(a) Environment: The external environment is an important strategic factor affecting the organisational\ndesign in relation to relation stability or unpredictable rapid changes. This would consider the impact\nof customers, suppliers, competitors, legal and political changes, and economic conditions. A more\nuncertain environment will have less predictable elements requiring the use of more specialised\nexperts who are trained to deal with the problems created by an ever changing situation. A stable\nenvironment can go for a more mechanistic structure.\n(b) Technology: Technology is a combination of tools, techniques and know how and has a major\ninfluence on organisational structure. The design of the organisational structure would depend upon\nwhether the technology is simple and routine requiring few repetitive tasks, where as mechanistic\nstructure is beneficial or complex, intensive technology where there is a high interdependence among\nmembers of the work-force, an organic structure will be operationally more effective.\n13.4 ORGANISATIONAL PROCESSES\nJoan Woodward studied the relationships between technology and organisational structure in the\nearly 1960\u2019s among some english manufacturing firms. She observed and concluded that technology\nis a major influence on organisational structure.She observed three types of production processes\nand their corresponding structures and concluded that the right combination of structure and technology\nwas highly critical. These three processes are:\n1. Small batch production: This involves specilised custom made products which requires special\nequipment and individual attention. An example would be making large stained glass windows.\n2. Mass Production: This is an assembly-line type of production in which a standardised item is\nproduced in large numbers with reasonably sophisticated equipment and the work units depend\nupon each other in a sequential manner. This is also known as long link technology. An example\nwould be the manufacture of air conditioners or cars.\n3. Continuous Process Technology: This system is highly sophisticated and automated and requires\nthe use of complex technology, as in the case of automated chemical plants. In such situations the\nuse of robotics and cybernetics is very common with continuous feeding of raw materials and self-\ncontrolling and self-correcting provision. In small batch as well as, continuous process, where\ntechnology is complex in terms of problem - solving requirements with a high interdependance among\nmembers of the work-force, the organic structure brings out the optimal results. 13.5 ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nOrganisation structure is the established pattern of relationships among components or parts of the\norganisation. It prescribe the relationships among various positions and activities in business.\nWhile developing an organisation structure,the two variables i.e. basic structure and operating\nmechanism are to be taken into consideration. The basic structure involves issues such as how the\nwork of the organisation is to be divided and assigned among positions, groups, departments, divisions\netc. and how to bring the required coordination for achieving organisational goals. The operating\nmechanism includes factors like information system, control procedures and application of\norganisational principles and practices.\nAn organisation structure serves various functions of the business. It is designed to serve specific\nmotives. There should also be efforts to match organisation structure with changing needs. A good\nstructure not only facilitates communication but also brings efficiency in different segments.\n13.6 DEPARTMENTATION DEFINITIONS, SCOPE, AND IMPORTANCE\nDepartmentation involves grouping of people or activities with similar characteristics into a single\ndepartment or unit. This facilitates communication, coordination and control, thus contributing to\norganisational success. It creates semi-autonomous units with independent responsibilities, providing\nsatisfaction to the managers which is turn improves efficiency and effectiveness.\nDefinitions:\nAccording to Knootz and O\u2019Donnell define a department as designating - \u201ca distinct area, division,\nor branch of an enterprise over which a manager has authority for the performance of specified\nactivities\u201d.\nScope and Importance:\nMost enterprises are involved in producing a product or a service for the benefit of others. The latter\naspect requires marketing or distribution so that the persons for whom the product or service is\nintended accept it. These activities require money or sufficient capital or finance. Thus for every\norganisation or enterprise there are three fundamental activities or functions to be performed, namely\n1. Production, 2. Marketing and 3. Finance. Thus functional departmentation consists of grouping of\ncommon activities to form an organisational unit. In short, units are formed around common functions.\nThe term functional departmentation is often used at the higher organisational levels. In addition to\nthe functional departmentation on the basis of production, marketing an finance, it is possible to\nattempt departmentation in different ways such as by product, by territory, by customer, by process\nand by task-force. Top management is at liberty to use any means of departmentation while forming\nan organisation structure. Usually for the top and bottom organisation levels, functional\ndepartmentationollowed and for the intervening organisation orgnaisational levels other means of\ndepartmentation are used. The selection of the media of departmentation will be determined on the\nbasis of the extent to which it is likely to achieve the objective. 13.8 TYPES OF DEPARTMENTATION, ADVANTAGES AND\nDISADVANTAGES\nDepartmentation can be in the following seven ways, namely -\n1. by function\n2. by product\n3. by territory, region or geographical area\n4. by customer\n5. by process\n6. by task force and\n7. by appropriate combination of these types\n(i) Departmentation by function\nThe simplest and the commonest type of departmentation is the functional type of structure which\nconsists of grouping all similar activities of the business into major departments or divisions under an\nexecutive reporting to the chief executive such as the managing director. The activities are here\ngrouped on the basis of functions to be performed like in marketing into product planning, marketing\nresearch, advertising and sales. This is the simplest and most common type of orgnaisation structure\nand is depicted in the following chart.\nOrganisational Structure\nShare Holders\nBoard of Directors\nManaging Director\nFinancial Marketing Production Personnel\nManager Manager Manager Manager\nMarketing Research Product Planning\nManager Manager\nSales Promotion Advertising Sales\nManager Manager Manager It will be noticed that below the Managing Director are four managers in charge of separate functions,\nnamely, finance, marketing, production and personnel. In the marketing set-up, described in greater\ndetail in this chart, under the marketing manager, separate managers are delegated functions such\nas marketing research, product planning, sales, advertising and sales promotion. In this way, similar\nactivities are grouped together into major departments and place under an executive who report to\nthe higher executive. The chart shows a more detailed functional basis. This type of departmentation\nor structure is quite suitable for small and medium sized business where the chief executive can\neasily co-ordinate his functional specialists.\nThe advantages of this type of structure are\n1. benefits of occupational specialisation;\n2. easier inter-departmental co-ordination; and\n3. logical and simple, easy-to-understand structure;\nThe disadvantages of the Functional Departmentation\n1. excessive centralisation;\n2. unsuitability where geographical centralisation is required.\n3. unsuitability where emphasis on product lines is called for; and\n4. Lower potency for developing managers for promotion.\n2. Department by product\nThe arrangement emphasizes the use of specialised knowledge and encourages a reasonable degree\nof specialisation. For example, the departmentation of department store is on the basis of types of\nproducts. A type of organised departmentation which has gained favour in recent years with large\norganisations with distinct types of products is the product type of organisation structure. In this type,\nthe product lines are segregated and special product executives placed in charge of each line. In this\ntype of structure, the marketing director may have a number of marketing manager under him, each\nlooking after a different group of products. Each marketing manager will then have under him his own\norganisation looking after the sales etc., of that particular product or line of products. The marketing\ndirector has under him three sales managers looking after different groups of products, namely,\nbatteries, points, radios and industrial products.\nThus in case of companies which are smaller than giant corporations with separate divisions, the\npopular form of structure is to assign to product or brand managers (some times even called sales\nmanagers) the responsibility for marketing decisions of particular products or groups of products.\nThe product manager here becomes like a little marketing manager. Advertising, sales promotion,\nmarketing research, etc., can be a centralised staff actively.\nThe following are some of the advantages of the product type of structure or departmentation\n1. Where it is extended right down to the salesman\u2019s level, it results in better customer service as\nthe salesman has deeper product knowledge.\n2. It simplifies determination of the profitability of each product line. 3. A new division can be added without interrupting the existing operation by merely extending the\nline and having another marketing manager and staff for that new product line or group of\nproducts.\n4. Top management secures more detailed and intimate information regarding the markets in relation\nto specific products.\n5. It is extremely suitable where product lines are complex and diverse and require specialised\nknowledge for selling and marketing as well as salesmen with specialised knowledge.\nDisadvantages\n1. It may cause customer annoyance and confusion as a number of salesman from the same\ncompany may pester him for different products.\n2. It involves extra costs of maintaining separate sales forces for each product group.\n3. There is a duplication of costs such as travelling expenses.\n3. Territorial Geographical Departmentation\nWhen several activities of an enterprise are geographically dispersed in different locations, territorial\nor geographical departmentation may be adopted. All activities relating to a particular area or zone\nmay be grouped together under one zonal manager or head. there may be further sub-division of\nactivities under one zonal manager as illustrated here.\nChief Executive\nManager Manager Manager Manager\nNorth Zone South Zone East Zone West Zone\nProduction Marketing Accounts\nDepartment Department Department\nAdvantages:\nThe territorial departmentation offers the following advantages.\n1. It enables an enterprise to cater to the needs of local people in a satisfactory manner.\n2. It enables a concern to make use of locational advantages.\n3. It facilitates effective control.\n4. It facilitates effective co-ordination of activities within an area.\n5. It assists in the development of all-round managerial talent.\nDisadvantages\n1. It is an expensive method of creating departments and over head costs are also increased. 2. It leads to duplication of activities which creates confusion and involves costs.\n3. Co-ordination among various territorial divisions may become difficult.\n4. By Customer\nA business house may be divided into a number of departments on the basis of customers it serves\nviz., large and small customers, industrial and ultimate buyers; government and other customers etc.\nThe peculiar advantage of customerwise departmentation is that it ensures full attention to different\ntypes of customers and their different needs, tastes and requirements can be met effectively. However\nit may not be possible to group all activities of an enterprise on the basis of cusotmers. In fact, sales\nactivities may be classified or grouped on such basis. But there may be problems of co-ordination\nwith others departments. There may not be enough work, at times, in case of certain types of customers.\nThis may lead to idle capacity.\n5. Equipmentwise departmentation (by task force)\nAn enterprise where production is carried through different processes may adopt process-wise\ndepartmentation to enable continuous flow of production. Similarly, where work is carried on machines\nwhich are common, departments may be created on the basis of equipments, such as milling\ndepartments, grinding departments, lathe department etc. The main advantage of this method is that\nit avoids duplication of equipment invarious activities. Moreover, specialised people can be engaged\nto work on specialised equipments and departments.\n6. By Task Force:\nUnder this system the responsibility for the completion of work rests upon an entire task - team and\nnormally one individual acts as the leader of the task force. Every member of the task-force identifies\nthe objectives and fully comprehends them. This type of departmentation is also termed \u201cproject\norganisation\u201d and is a refinement of advanced planning and controlling techniques such as PERT.\nThis system helps build an organisation unit aimed at completing a series of events utilising the best\navailable talent. After the project is completed, the organisation is disbanded with the personnel and\nphysical resources becoming available for personnel, since each members is objective minded and\nthanks always of achieving the good.\nAdvantages:\n1. The possibility of developing manager\u2019s who can use different types of resources and\n2. the specialised complete team setup for performing the task results in greater concentration and\nmore production results.\nDisadvantages:\n1. The fostering of a feeling of frustration caused by being a separate unit and not a part of the\nwhole team with chances of promotion to the highest positions being less.\nI. Departmentation by a combination of types\nHuge corporations often combine the advantages of both the functional and the product divisional\ntypes of organisations where such a combination is maintained, the central office product manager\nexercise his authority on the decentralised staff personnel indirectly through the division executive. A\nclear distinction has to be made between the line and functional authority. The divisional manager will have line authority overall executives who report to him and over sales and thus has the right and\nresponsibility to develop sales policy and methods. The functional specialists report to the chief\nexecutive having no line authority but merely functional authority.\n13.8 SUMMARY\nIn this lesson organisational design, factors of organisational design, organisational processes, and\norganisational structure, is explained in detail. The classical design has been in existence since the\nearliest management days. Moreover, most enterprises are involved in producing a product or a\nservice for the benefit of others. Therefore, departmentation involves grouping of people or activities\nwith similar characteristics in to a single department or unit. Thus, the selection of the media of\ndepartmentation will be determined on the basis of the extent to which it is likely to achieve the\nobjective. As such departmentation can be classified into seven types. viz. (1) by function, 2. by\nproduct, 3. by territory, 4. by customer, 5. by process, 6. by task force and 7. by appropriate combination\nof these types.\n13.9 TECHNICAL TERMS\nDesign - Prepare a design for plan, intend\nProcesses - a series of action to achieve an event\nStructure - the way a thing is contructed\nDepartment - a section of an organisation with a special function\n13.10 SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1.

The\nfollowing are the features of a good organisation structure.\n1. There should be a clear line of authority from top to the bottom.\n2. Delegation of authority must be commensurate with the responsibility assigned.\n3. As par as possible minimum levels of management may be created.\n4. Span of control: This refers to the number of people a manager can directly superwise. A person\nshould superwise only that number of subordinates to whom he can directly keep under contract.\n14.2 MEANING, SCOPE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPAN OF CONTROL\nThe span of control has been defined as the number of subordinates under one manager. It is also\nknown as \u201cspan of management\u201d. In a wider span of control, a manager has many subordinates who\nreport to him. In a narrow span of control, a manager has fewer subordinates. Obviously, the number\nof subordinates that can be effectively, managed for supervision and delegation of authority would\ndepend upon a number of factors. 14.3 THEORIES OF SPAN OF CONTROL\n(A) Hamilton\u2019s Theory\nPerhaps the first person to bring the principles of span of control to public attention was a soldier - the\nlate General Sir Ian Humilton. The following statement of his, although it reflects his military\nassociation, has great application to any other type organisation -\nThe average human brain finds its effective scope in handling from three to six other brains. If a man\ndivides the whole of his into two branches and delegates his possibility, freely and properly, to two\nexperienced heads of branches he will not have enough to do. The occasions when they would refer\nto him would be too few to keep him fully occupied. If he delegates to three heads he will be kept fairly\nbusy whilst six heads of branches will give most bosses a ten hours day. Those data are the results\nof centuries of the experience of soldiers, which are greater, where organisation is in question, than\nthose of politicians, businessmen or any other class of men.\nOf all the ways of waste there is none so vicious as that of your clever politician trying to run a\nbusiness concern without having any notion of self-organisation. One of them who took over munitions\nfor a time had so little idea of organising his own every that he nearly died of overwork through\nholding up the work of others; i.e., by delegating responsibility coupled with direct access to himself\nto seven sub-chiefs! Now it will be understood why a Baltalion has four companies (and not seventeen):\nwhy a Brigade has three or four battalions (and not seventeen)\nThe nearer we approach the supreme head of the whole organisation, the more we ought to work\ntowards groups of six.\n(B) Graicunar Formula\nThe French management consultant V.A. Graicunar, after analysing subordinates - superior\nrelationships, developed a mathematical formula. His theory identifies developed a mathematical\nformula. His theory identifies three types of subordinates - superior relationships, namely:\n1. direct single relationships\n2. direct group relationships, and\n3. cross relationships\nHe felt that direct single relationships were easily understood and recognised but one should not\nforget the relationships with different groups of subordinates and the cross relationships between all\nthe subordinates. These relationships vary considerably with the size of the subordinates groups.\nWhile the suervisor\u2019s own direct relationships with individuals increase in proportion to the addition of\nsubordinates, the group and corss relationships increase much more than proportionately.\n14.4 LIMITED SPAN OF CONTROL\nThere are both benefits and criticisms of the adivce to have a limited span of control. The advantages\nof a narrow span are -\n1. tighter controdl and closer supervision 2. case of managing fewer and more specilised people and activities; and\n3. availability of time to think and plan for the feature.\nAs against this criticisms levied against the span include\n1. the additional costs of having more managers with their respective staff.\n2. added complexity introduced inconnection with communications by having more levels; and\n3. Prevention of democratic participation within the organisation.\nCritics of the narrow span advocate a more flat set up or organisation structure which reduce the\nlevels and administrative distance, thus generating initiative and group cohesiveness.\nIt is interesting to note that a study conducted by the American Management Association indicated\nthat in case of over 50 per cent of the sample, the chief executives span was 9 or more subordinates.\nOne third of them had 11 or more subordinates.\nWhat can be agreed is that as one travels higher up the hierarchical structure of management, there\nwill be a decrease in the span of management of the number of persons who can be effectively\nsupervised. The limitation inherent in the span of control makes delegation of authority necessary\nand reveals the importance of adequate organisation to attain the objectives.\nIt is possible to reduce the burden of the manager and expand his psan on control by means of\nadequate delegation coupled with clear planning. The span of control can be increased by the ability\nto cummunicate plans and instructions concisely and clearly.\n14.5 FACTORS DETERMINING THE SPAN\nA. Similarity of functions: If the subordinates are involved in the same or similar activities, then\nit is possible for the manager to supervise more subordinates, since the problems that may arise\nwould be similar in nature, these would be easier to handle. Conversely, if these subordinates are\ndoing diversified operations, the situation would be more complex and hence the span of control\nshould be narrow.\nB. Complexity of functions: If the operations that the employees are performing are sophisticated\nand complex and require constant supervision, then it would be more difficult for the manager to\nmanage too many employees.\nC. Geographical closeness of employees: The closer the subordinates are in a physical location,\nthe easier it will be for the supervisor to manage more employees.\nD. Direction and Co-ordination: The span of control would also be determined by the degree of\ncoordination required, both within the unit and with other units of other divisions.\nIf the unit needs continuous directions and extra time of the manager in coordinating the activities\nthen fewer subordinates will be better supervised.\nE. Capacity of Subordinates: Subordinates who are trained, developed and experienced, need\nlittle supervision in discharging their duties. In such situations, more subordinates can be effectively\nsupervised. These subordinates can further be assisted by providing them with \u201cstanding plans\u201d\nwhich are applicable in repetitive actions and recurring problems, requiring less direct supervisory\nassistance. F. The working staff of the manager: If the manager has supporting staff that is equally skilled\nin handling situations then it would be possible to manage a wider span of control because the\nresponsibilities of supervision would be shared.\nG. Planning: The effectiveness of supervision would also depend upon how much time manager\nspend upon planning activities. If the managers spend too much time in systems planning then they\nwill not have time to supervise the activities of too many subordinates.\n14.6 SUMMARY\nThe term \u2018span\u2019 literally means the space between two supports of a structure e.g., the space between\ntwo pillars of a bridge. The space between the two pillars should neither be too large nor too small. If\nit is too large, the bridge may collapse; and if it too small, it will enhance its costs. The ideal number\nmay be different under different situations depending upon the time, knowledge, energy and abilities\nof the supervisor.\n14.7 TECHNICAL TERMS\nSpan : Something\u2019s extent them end to end, the distance.\nDelegation : to grant or confer authority\n14.8 SELF - ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1.

The main purpose of delegation is to make organisation possible. Further, decentralisation\nof authority as a position where the ultimate authority to command or control as well as the ultimate\nresponsibility for results is placed as far down in the organisation as in consonance with the efficient\nmanagement of the enterprise. Thus delegation and decentralisation are related concepts.\n15.2 NATURE OF DELEGATION\nIn Management, the term delegation is generally used to mean the granting of right and approval to\nothers to function within prescribed limits. In short, delegation enables the subordinate to receive from his superior authority to accomplish takes assigned to him, and the superior and at the same\ntime retains his original authority. The delegation of authority takes place when organisational power\nis given to a subordinate by a superior. A manager cannot delegate authority which he himself does\nnot possess. The entire process of delegation of authority starts with an assigning of the tasks.\nThus, the delegation process consists of three facts namely -\n(1) an assignment of the task or duty creating an obligation or responsibility.\n(2) a granting of the necessary authority, approval, right or power, and\n(3) the creation of accountability for failure to perform the task so assigned.\nThe first step of assigning duties and responsibilities forces the executives to consider how best the\nwork can be sub-divided into responsibilities to be assigned and selection of those who are best fitted\nto discharge such responsibilities.\nDelegation of authority can be specific or general, written or unwritten and it must be accompanied\nby certain kinds of assignment of duties. It is always better to delegate the authority specifically in\nwriting to avoid conflicts and overlapping.\n15.4 DELEGATION WITHOUT ABDICATION (fail to fulfil)\nThe grantor can always recover the authority which he had delegated. In short, the original possessor\ndoes not permanently relieve himself of the power of recovery of authority be merely delegating it.\nTherefore a manager may recover all the formerly delegated authority and redelegate it partly or\ncompletely to another person as the situation in the organisation may require.\n15.5 BENEFITS OF DELEGATION\n1. Relieving top Executives: Top executives cannot perform and supervise each and every work.\nMoreover, they are required to undertake important tasks of planning and controlling. Delegation\nhelps executives in delegating their work to subordinate officers.\n2. Improved functioning: In the absence of delegation some persons may be burdened with more\ntasks while others may not have sufficient work to do. Delegation helps in rationalising the functioning\nof an organisation. Work is divided among various persons in such a way that it is done in an efficient\nway. Nobody is unduly burdened and no work is left unattended.\n3. Use of specialists: Delegation enables the use of specialists for taking up different functions.A\nproduction manager will be assigned the task of production, a sales manager will look after sales\ndepartment, a lawer will look after legal matters and so on. The use of specialists for different functions\nwill improve the quality of work.\n4. Helps in Employee Development: Delegation of authority is a very important step in the\ndevelopment of subordinates. The benefits of participation in various executive training programmes,\nseminars and workshops may not be substantial of delegation of authority is neglected.\n5. Provides Motivation: Adequate delegation, resulting in development of subordinates, encourages\nthe subordinates to look forward to promotions in the future. This motivates them to better and more\neffective efforts on their respective jobs. 15.6 THE PROBLEMS OF DELEGATION\nDespite the benefits of delegation, in practice there are many problems. There are :\n1. Over confidence of Superior: The feeling in a superior that only he can do certain work effectively\nthan others is the main difficulty in delegation.\n2. Lack of confidence in subordinates: The superior may be of the view that subordinates are not\ncompetent to carry out certain things of their own. He may lack of confidence in his subordinates.\nUnder these circumstances superior will hesitate to delegate authority.\n3. Lack of ability in superior: A superior may lack the ability to delegate authority to subordinates.\nThe manager may not be able to identify the areas where delegation is required. He may not even be\nable to identify the areas where delegation is required. He may not even be able to chalk out the\nproper process of delegation. The lack of competence on the part of superior restricts the delegation\nof authority.\n15.7 OBSTACLES TO DELEGATION\nThe following are some of the reasons for an executives reluctance to delegate to his subordinates -\n1. The dominance desire: The desire to dominate, which is very strong in certain executives,\nunconsciously restricts such executives ability to delegate.\n2. Fear of Incompetency: The subconscious fear that subordinate will prove superior to the executive\nhimself prevents such an executive from delegating.\n3. Lack of confidence: A third possible reason is lack of confidence in the subordinate which may be\nsubjective and almost unconscious. This is a result of acceptance of the \u201cindispenble man\u201d theory.\n4. Intolerance towards Ambiguity: The executive may be handicapped by a temperamental aversion\nto taking a chance.\n15.8 TEN COMMANDMENTS OF EFFECTIVE DELEGATION\nThe following principles may be considered as essentials for effective delegation of authoirty -\n1. Delegate by Results expected: The assignments should be defined and authority must be\ndelegated in light of results desire.\n2. Select appropriate subordinate for delegation: The subordinate should be selected in the light\nof the work to be achieved. The delegation will be influenced by the qualifications of persons. This is\nthe purpose of the managerial function of staffing and must be carefully considered.\n3. Maintain parity of authority and responsibility: Authority should be delegated commensurate\nwith responsibility. This is on the assumption that where subordinates are held responsible for\nperformance of certain duties.\n4. Ensure unity of command: This is one of the common principles of organisation advocated by\nHenry Fayol which stresses that each subordinate should have only one boss to whom he should be accountable to avoid consfusion and friction. Of course, in practice, it is not always possible to follow\nthis princple.\n5. Maintain adequate communication: There should be free and continuous flow of information\nbetween the superior and the subordinate with a view to furnish the subordinate with relevant\ninformation to help him make decisions and also to interpret properly the authority delegated to him.\nPlans may change and decisions have to be taken in the light of the changed conditions.\n6. Establish proper control: Since the manager is primarily accountable to his superiors, it is\nnecessary to make sure that the authority delegated is properly utilised.\n7. Reward Effective Delegation: Effective delegation and successful assumption of authority must\nbe rewarded. This will provide a proper environmental climate for fuller delegation and effective\nassumption of authority.\n8. Establish a climate of confidence: The subordinate to whom authority is delegated, must mentally\nfell free from fear and have a feeling of confidence that delegation will not result in punishment but is\nan opportunity for his own self - development and growth.\n9. Establish a strong belife in delegation: For delegation to be sucessful the manager who delegates\nmust himself be convinced of the need and benefits of delegation. He must also be willing to allow his\nsubordinates to make mistakes although he can be stricter when the same mistake is repeated.\n10. Help the subordinate: The executive who delegates must watch the subordinate, not as a\npoliceman, but as a friend or helper. Whenver assistance is required, it should be readily forthcoming.\n15.9 NATURE OF DECENTRALISATION\nDefinition: The decentralisation of authority may e defined as a position where the ultimate authority\nto command or control as well as the ultimate responsibility for result is placed as far down in the\norganisation as in congonance with the efficient management of the enterprise.\nNature: In organising, a highly important concept related to the question of delegation is the extent\nof centralisation or decentalisation of authority in a particular organisational structure. Centralisation\nin this context refers to concentration of authority whilst decentralisation expresses greater dispersion\nof authority in actual practice, there is some decentralisation of authority in very organisation as other\nwise there cannot be a structure with management hierarchical levels.\n15.11 CENTRALISATION Vs DECENTRALISATION\nConsiderable debate has taken place over the years over the issue of \u2018centralisation\u2019 which means\nthat the authority for most decisions is concentrated at the top of the managerial hierarchy versus\n\u2018decentralisation\u2019. which requires such authority to be dispersed by extension and delegation throughout\nall levels of management. There are advantages and disadvantages of both types of structure and\npure form centralisation is not practical except in small companies and pure form of decentralisation\nalmost never exists. However, the organisational structure would determine the degree of centralisation\nor the degree of decentralisation. As the organisations grow bigger by expansion, mergers of acquisitions, decentralisation becomes\nboth necessary and practical. If an automobile manufacturing company acquires a company which\nmakes refrigerators, then decentralisation would be the natural outcome since policies and decisions\nin these two areas may not be similar.\n15.11 BENEFITS OF DECENTRALISATION\nDecentralisation and centralisation both enjob certain benefits and corresponding defects. Some of\nthe advantages of decentralisation are as follows.\n1. Relieves Higher Executives: A decentralised organisation structure reqires delegation of authoirty\nwhich relieves the top managers of their routine work. This is an answer to the problem of expanding\nthe size of a business. Top executives can concentrate more on important decisions relating to\nplanning for the future whilst delegating the operating decisions to self-contained units with competent\nmanagers in charge of each such unit.\n2. Facilitates Managerial Development: It encourages the development of generalists, facilitating\nsuccession into the position of general managers. Expansion of business requires the production of\nthe generalist type of managers who can co-ordinate the several activities and perform the managerial\nfunction of planning, organising, staffing, motivating and controlling.\n3. Fasters co-ordination: It results in the promotion of intimate personalities and relationships which\nresult in greater employee co-ordination and enthusiasm. here greater co-ordination is secured at\ndivisional levels where all the activities necessary are grouped.\n4. Facilitates Control: The profit centre concept can be used for controlling divisional operations by\nmeasuring performance against the standard of profits generated by such divisions. The divisional\nmanager\u2019s efficiency can be evaluated in terms of the returns on investment concept. In this way,\ncompetition can be fastered among the divisions.\n5. Encourages greater Efficiency: The competitive atmosphere inculcated by the profit center concept\nincreases the efficiency of the divisions. Besides, trouble spots can be located and remedied more\neasily, which also results in an increase of efficiency.\n6. Infuses Maximum Motivation: By placing greater decision making power on managers down the\nline, initiative is promoted and the managers are motivated to higher performance.\n15.12 PROBLEMS AND DISADVANTAGES OF DECENTRALISATION\nThe following are some of the limitations and problems faced by decentralisation.\n1. Increased Costs: Unless the business size is large enough, the overhead costs of decentralisation\nwould be relatively too heavy as each division has to be a self-contained unit with all the service\nfunction available within the division. This naturally results in duplication of functions with result\nuneconomic use of resource.\n2. Need for generalist manager: For success in decentralisation, it is necessary to have capable\nexecutives with general management ability as the decentralised organisation has to place great\nreliance on the divisonal manager\u2019s effectiveness. 3. Greater need for control at policy level: The independence generated by decentralisation requires\nadequate establishment of policies at the centralised level. Too much of such control may result in\nless decentralisation. Inadequacy of controls have forced certain organisations to recentralize the\noperations.\n15.13 FACTORS DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF DECENTRALISATION\nThe following are, therefore, the important factors which determine the extent of decentralisation of\nauthority which is considered desirable for a particular organisation.\n1. Size and complexity of the organisation: Large organisations with diverse product line and\nconglomerates with companies involved in different fields would find centralisation to be more effective\ndue to limitations in managerial expertise as well as increased executive work load.\n2. High costs of decisions: The more expensive or costly the action to be decided upon, the chances\nare that it will be decided at the higher levels of management. Thus the decision of whether to have\nanother factory or not would be taken at the top levels, whilst the question of purchasing of stationary\nwould be taken at an extremely low level.\n3. Highly differentiated product lines: where the product lines in a company are very different the\nextreme case being of industrial and consumer products both existing in the same company -\ndecentralisation or divisionalisation becomes very important.\n4. Availability of Managerial Manpower: Decentralisation of authority requires the availability of\ncompetent managers. The organisation must provide adequate training and development facilities\nfor managers and decentralisation is one of the good methods of encouraging such development. A\nlarge firm can even decentralise with the objective of developing managers.\n5. Top level Management Philosophy: A subordinate generally copies his boss. Thus the whole\norganisation is often moulded round the character of the top management. The management\nphilosophy of top management determines to a large extent how much the several managers in the\norganisation are willing to retain authority or delegate it down the line.\n6. Environmental influences: The contingency theory of organisation stresses that an organisation\u2019s\nstructure and functioning are dependent on its interface with the external environment. The external\nfactors relate to dealing with labour unions, community officials, lobbying in the government or matters\nrelating to defence contracts etc. These factors necessitate centralisation.\n15.14 SUMMARY\nDelegation is an administrative process of getting things done by others by giving them responsibility.\nAll important decisions are taken at top level by Board of Directors. The exectuion is entrusted to\nChief Executive. The chief executive assigns the work to deparmtental managers who in turn delegate\nthe authority to their subordinates. Further, decentralisation of authority as a position where the\nultimate authority to command or control as well as the ultimate responsibility for results in placed as\nfar down in the organisation. Thus delegation and decentralisation are related concepts. 15.15 SELF - ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\nEssay Type\n1. What are the elements of delegation. Explain its advantages and disadvantages.\n2.

It represents hierarchical arrangement of various positions in the organisation.\nThe following are some of the important forms or types of organisation:\nA. Line Organisation.\nB. Staff or Functional Organisation\nC. Line and Staff Organisation\nD. Committee form of Organisation\n16.3 LINE ORGANISATION\nLine organisation is the basic framework for whole organisation. It represents a direct vertical\nrelationship through which authority flows. This is the simplest and oldest, know as chain of command\nor scalar principles. The authority flows from top to the lower levels.\nIn words of J.M Lundy, \u201cIt is characterised by direct lines of authority flowing from the top to the\nbottom of the organisational hierarchy and lines of responsibility flowing in an opposite but equally\ndirect manner.\nThis form of organisation is followed in military establishments. The commander-in-chief is at the top\nwith various other officers at the lower levels. The officers at downward positions drive authority from\ntop. The modern military organisations do not entirely rely on line organisation. They have staff wings\nlike intelligence, medinal and so on.\n16.4 TYPES OF LINE ORGANISATION\nThe Line organisation is of two types:\n(a) Pure Line Organisation\n(b) Departmental Line Organisation\na) Pure Line Organisation: In pure line organisation all persons at a given level perform the same\ntype of work. The divisions are solely for the purpose of control and direction.\nThe following figure gives an idea of pure line organisation.\nProduction Manager\nForeman \u2018A\u2019 Foreman \u2018B\u2019 Foreman \u2018C\u2019\nworkers\nworkers workers\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\n(Group A) (Group B) (Group C) B. Departmental Line Organisation: This type of line organisation divides the enterprise into different\ndepartments which are convenient for control purposes. There is a unity on control and line of authority\nflows from top to the bottom. The whole organisation is put under the overall control of chief executive\nwho may be called by the name of General Manager.\nDifferent departments are put under the control of departmental managers. Departmental managers\nget orders directly from the General Manager. The managers are nto dependent upon each other.\nEvery department has its own line of organisation.\n16.5 MERITS OF LINE ORGANISATION\n(A) Simplicity: Line organisation is simple to establish and can be easily understood by the employees.\nEverybody knows his work and also to whom he is responsible. So it be operated simply and clearly.\n(B) Quick Decisions: Only one person is incharge of a department or divisions.\n(C) Clear-cut of authority and responsibility: Responsibility, authority and accountability are all\nclear-cut, easily assignable and traceable.\n(D) Effective Communication: Communication is fast and easy and feedback can be acted upon\nfaster.\n(E) Co-Ordination: The hierarchy in management helps in achieving effective co-ordination. The\ngeneral manager is incharge of all the departments and he can easily co-ordinate the work of various\ndepartments.\n(F) Flexibility: Since the manager has to take all important decisions, he can make changes if new\nsituation warrants. He can take a decision according to the requirements of the situation.\n(G) Unity of Command: In line organisation every person is under the command of one boss only.\nThe type of organisation is in accordance with the principle of scalar chain.\n16.6 DEMERITS OF LINE ORGANISATION\n(A) Rigid and inflexible: It is a rigid and inflexible form of organisation and there is a tendency for\nline authority to become dictatorial.\n(B) Instability: The business is dependent upon some key persons and the sudden disappearance\nof such persons from the scene may create instability in the business.\n(C) Favouritism: There is scope for favouritism in line organisation. The officers work according to\ntheir whims and preferences. They judge the performance of persons according to their own likings.\nThey judge the performance of persons according to their own yard sticks. There is a likelihood that\nsome persons may be given followers and deserving persons, on the other hand, may be ignored.\n(D) Lack of specialisation: The lack of managerial specialisation is the demerit of line organisation.\nThe line officers cannot be experts in every line of business. Therefore, the line officers will have to\ndepend heavily on subordinates for advice.\n16.7 STAFF ORGANISATION (FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATION)\nF.W. Taylor, Father of Scientific Management, developed the concept of functional organisation. He\nrecommended functional organisation even at the shop level where workers have to produce goods. He thought that one foreman could not manage all the aspects of production work for directing a\ngroup of employees as they could not have varied knowledge. He suggested the substitution of line\nauthority by functional foremanship at the lower levels of the organisation structure.\n16.8 TYPES OF STAFF ORGANISATION\nTaylor suggested the division of supervisory functions into two groups, viz., (1) office specialists and\n(2) shop specialists.\n1. Office Specialists: They are concerned with the design, scheduling, recording and planning of\nwork. The office staff consists of following persons: (a) Route clerk (b) Instruction card clerk\n(c) Time and cost clerk and (d) Disciplinarian.\n2. Shop specialists: They guide and supervise the work in the factory. The following are the shop\nspecialists: (a) Gang boss (b) Speed boss (c) Repair boss and (d) Inspector.\n16.9 ADVANTAGES OF STAFF ORGANISATION\nThe staff organisation has the following advantages:\n(A) Economy of operations: The use of specialists helps in controlling the waste of materials,\nmoney and time. The consolidation of activities leads to optimum use of facilities like office\naccommodation, plant and machinery, etc.\n(B) Relief to Top Executives: Top executives are not unnecessarily burdened or happens in line\norganisation. The line officer is supposed to be a jack of all trades and is burdened with all types of\nworks. On the contrary a specialist is a matter of his line and he has the expertise and capability of\ntaking his own decisions.\n(C) Better Supervision: Every superior is an expert in his own area and he will be successful in\nmaking proper planning and execution. The superiors being well acquanited with the work, they will\nbe able to improve the level of supervision.\n(D) Democratic control: This type of organisation eliminates one man control. There will be a joint\ncontrol and supervision in the organisation.\n(E) Scope for growth: The staff organsiation provides wide scope for growth and mass production.\nThe employment of specialists at various level of work enables the organisation to grow as per the\nneeds of the situation.\n(F) Flexibility: This organisation allows changes in organisation without disturbing the whole work.\nThe span of supervision can also be adjusted according to the requirement.\n16.10 DISADVANTAGES OF STAFF ORGANISATION\n(A) Group Rivalaries: The emergence of many persons of equal status encourage group rivalaries\namong executives. Persons connected with different fields try to create their groups and then rivalary\nstarts among these groups. Every group tries to dominate the order. The growth of the unit is adversely\naffected in a vicious atmosphere. (B) Lack of Co-ordination: The appointment of several specialists creates problems of co-ordination,\nespecially when the advice of more than one is needed for taking decisions. This created conflicts\namong specialists and co-ordination becomes a problem.\n(C) Conflict in Authoriy: The principles of \u2018unit of command\u2019 is violated in functional organisation. A\nsubordinate is answerable to many bosses. Every superior considers his work important and wants\nthe workers to give top priority to his assignment.\n(D) Poor Disipline: The division of authority creates problems of discipline. The workers have to\nobey many bosses, their loyalty becomes divided. Disicipline tends to break down not only among\nworkers but also among lower level supervisors.\n(E) Expensive: Multiplicity of experts increases overhead expenses of the organsiation. Therefore\nsmall units cannot afford to have functional organisation.\n16.11 LINE AND STAFF ORGANISATION\nBoth line and staff organisations suffer from same drawbacks. On the other hand, line organisation is\nautocratic and staff organisation, on the other hand, has loose control. Line and staff organisation\neliminates the drawbacks of both and also has the good points of them. It is a happy blending of line\nand staff organisations. Both line and staff personnel have important roles today. This organisation\nowes its birth to the army. A commander in the field is assisted by staff officers in planning and\nexecuting his strategies. He will like to know the position of his enemies so that he is able to plan his\nown placings. Staff officer helps the commander in all aspects of his job.\nA line manager is vested with executive authority. He is responsible for making important decisions\nand is also accountable for their implications. Line officers are responsible for the accomplishment of\nvarious objectives. The authority flows vertically from top to bottom. The staff organisation facilitates\nthe accomplishment of organisational objectives by making available valuable advice and expert\nknowledge. Staff officers may be asked to suggest solutions to various problems entrested by line\nofficers. They have no authority to command the line staff but have control within their own\norganisations.\n16.12 ADVANTAGES OF LINE AND STAFF ORGANISATION\nThis organisation has the following advantages.\n(A) Balanced and Prompt Decisions: The functional managers have the advantage of expert advice\nwhen taking important decisions. The staff can also be used to investigate and advice on inter-\ndepartmental relationships. The line officers can take balanced and quick decisions.\n(B) Quick Actions: The line officers will have sufficient time to take various decisions. Whenever\nthere is a need for certain decisions, they will be able to devote time and decide the things. This type\nof situation helps in solving many issues which would have created difficulties if timely decisions\nwould not have been taken.\n(C) Specialisation: Line and staff organisation introduced specialisation in a systematic manner.\nPerosns with specialised knowledge are pointed to help line officers. The planning part is generally\nundertaken by staff personnel and line officers are able to devote much time for execution. (D) Growth and Expansion: The line and staff organisation is quite suitable for growth and expansion.\nThe burden of line staff is eased by the appointment of specialists. Line officers will be able to devote\nmuch time for future planning. The present staff will enable the expansion and growth of unit.\n16.13 DISADVANTAGES OF LINE AND STAFF ORGANISATION\n(A) Expensive: This type of organisation is very expensive because a large number of specialists\nare appointed. The persons being experts in their fields, they demand higher emoluments. Therefore,\nsmall and medium concerns cannot afford line and staff organisation because of its expensive nature.\n(B) More dependence on staff: The line officers become habituated for advice on staff. They refer\neverying to staff for advice. Over-dependence on staff will make line officers less creative. They will\nnot give much thought to any activity since advice will be available from staff.\n(C) Ineffective Staff: The staff officers donot wield any power in the organisation. Without power\nthey will not get prestige in the organisation. They will fell unimportant and the quality of advice will\nalso be adversely affected.\n(D) Conflict between line and staff personnel: There is a possibility of conflict between line and\nstaff personnel. The responsibility for operations lies with line officers while staff officers only advice.\nThe staff officers feel ignored at the hands of line officers. The line officers, on the other hand,\ncomplain of interference by staff persons in the day-to-day working. The comflict between line and\nstaff officials adversely affects the work in the organisation.\n16.14 LINE AND STAFF CONFLICTS\nLine and Staff structure is based on the assumption that both will help and support each other. But\noften there are conflicty between the two and both accuse each other. There is a lack of understanding\nand both try to dominate each other.Some of the reasons of conflict between the two are as follows.\n(I) Line managers have the following complaints against staff\na) Staff officers claim credit for programmes which are successful but do not want to share responsibility\nfor their failure.\nb) Staff officers are more theoretical than practical.\nc) Staff officers do not remain contended by giving advice only. They try to persuade the line for\nimplementing whatever they have suggested. They trespass their field of activity and enter the\nareameant for line people.\nd) Though staff officers are well qualified and have good knowledge of their field but try dominate line\nofficers. They feel themselves superior to line officer.\nII. Staff personnel have the following complaints:\na) Line officers do not make proper use of expert knowledge of the staff.\nb) Staff people feel that their advice is not properly implemented by the line personnel.\nc) Line officers are not generally enthusiastic about the new ideas suggested by the staff. They resist\nnew things and insist on following the traditions. d) Staff officers do not have authority to implement thier ideas. They should be given authority like\nline officers in supervising the implementation of their suggestions.\n16.15 RESOLVING OF LINE STAFF CONFLICTS\nThe following are some of the ways in which conflicts between line and staff can be resolved or\nminimised.\n1. Remove the \u201cHalo\u201d effect: Both line and staff executives must understand their respective\nimportance and relationships. Overbearing attitudes on both sides should be removed.\n2. Adopt a more patient attitude: Staff men should avoid being impatient when the line does not\nseem to understand and line management should be more patient when it thinks that the staff is\nimpractical.\n3. Assume a helpful attitude: Staff men should gain the confidence of line executives by adoping a\nhelpful attitude and not an attitude of overbearance. They must see the problems as line men see\nthem. They must try and find out from the line managers what their problems are and then try to help\nsolve them without seeming superior.\n4. Avoid playing the expert: The staff person should playing the role of an expert. He must show\nsincere regard for the abilities of the line manager who may not posses the same academic background.\n5. Speak the language of the Hearer: Staff men who are experts often talk in their technical language\nwhich line men do not understand. This causes resentment and creates a mental barrier in the line\nmanager who through resentment febuses to understand the staff men. Every technical man has his\nown Jarson which must be played down while speaking to line management.\n6. Remove the Ecar complex: As some staff men are nearer top management than the line managers\nthey advice, line managers often feel frustrated and therefore resist staff suggestion. Thus staff men\nmust try to show that by helping line managers becoming more productive the line manager concerned\nwould get greater recognition or prominance.\nThus the resolving of conflicts between line and staff is really a question fo developing the right\nattitude in both line and staff executives.\n16.16 COMMITTEE FORM OF ORGANISATION\nThe committees are very common in the business world. The Board of Directors is an example of a\ncommittee. A number of persons may come together to take a decision, decide a course of action,\nadvise line officers on some matters, it is a committee form of organisation. It is a method of collective\nthinking, corporate judgement and common decision. But it is a method of attaching persons or\ngroups to line departments for advice and guidance in business planning and execution.\n16.17 NEED FOR COMMITTEES\nThe main reason for committees is to secure common judgement on administrative matters. The\ncommittees are set up for the following reasons. 1. The committees provide a forum for exchanging ideas among organisation members.\n2. The exchange of ideas among members may generate some suggestions and recommendations\nwhich may be useful for the organisation.\n3. There can be proper discussion on present problems and efforts are made to find solutions.\n4. The committees may also be needed in establishing and developing organisational policies.\n16.18 TYPES OF COMMITTEES\nDifferent committees may be formed with different ideas and purposes. Some committees may be\nonly advisory while some may perform managerial functions. There may be following types of\ncommittees.\n1. Formal and Informal Committees: If a committee is formed as a part of organisation structure\nand is delegated some duties and authority it is a formal committee. An informal committee may be\nformed to tackle some problems. the chief executive may call a meeting of departmental heads and\nsome experts to find out a solution. In this case it is a case of an informal organisation.\n2. Advisory Committees: These are the committees to advice line heads on certain issues. Line\nofficers may refer some problems or issues to a committee for advice. The committee will collect\ninformation about the problem and recommend solution for the same.\n3. Line Committees: There may be committees with managerial powers. Instead of giving work to\none person it may assigned to a number of executives. These committees also direct and control the\nactivities of employees for achieving organisational goals.\n16.19 ADVANTAGES OF COMMITTEE FORM ORGANISATION\n1.Executive training: Committees provide a good forum for training executives. They learn the\nvalue of intuaition, group dynamics and human relations. They are exposed to various view points\nand learn the are of reaching decisions and solving organisational problems.\n2. Better communication: It is a better form for discussing matters of mutual interest and reaching\ncertain conclusions. The members will transmit correct and authentic information and also convey\nthe background of taking these decisions.\n3. Motivation: The committees consist of managers as well as subordinates. The views of subordinates\nare given recognition and importance. It gives them encouragement and makes them feel as an\nintegral part of decision making process. Such committees boost the morale of subordinates and\nmotivate them to improve their performance.\n4. Better co-ordination: Committee form of organisation brings more co-ordination among different\nsegments of the organisation when representatives of different departments sit together.\n16.20 WEAKNESS OF COMMITTEE FORM OF ORGANISATION\n1. Lack of Effectiveness: The role of committees is not effective in all areas. The committees may\nbe useful where grievance redressal or inter personal departmental matters are concerned. Committees\nmay not be effective where policies are to be framed and quick decisions are required. 2. Domination by some members: Some members try to dominate in the committee meetings.\nThey try to thrust their view point on others. The aggressiveness of some members helps them to\ntake majority with them and minority view is ignored.\n3. Delay: The main drawback of committee form of organisation is delay in taking decisions. A\nnumber of persons express their view points in meetings and a lot of time is taken or reaching a\ndecision.\n4. No Accountability: No individual accountability can be fixed if these decisions are bad. Every\nmember of the committee tries to defend himself by saying that he suggested a different solution. If\naccountability is not fixed then it is the weakness of the organisation.\n16.21 HOW TO MAKE COMMITTEES EFFECTIVE\nThe defects of the committee system and the plural executive indicate that committees must be used\nappropriately. The following are suggestions for a more effective use of the committee system, namely.\n1. Choose an effective chairman: The chairman plays a very important role in committee meetings,\nas he can guide the members and ensure that each one is permitted to express his view point without\nfear or fallow.\n2. Select suitable subject matter: A plural executive is effective only in certain types of management\nfunctions. The subject matter for committees should, therefore, be limited to such areas. The subject\nmatter should also be communicated in advance along with the agenda as already mentioned.\n3. Clearly define the scope and authority of the committee: The members must know clearly\nwhat their authority is and the area in which they can arrive at decisions. They should also know\nwhether they have line or staff authority.\n4. Reasonable number: The number of members of committees should neither be too large nor too\nsmall. The number should be such which is essential for taking collective decisions. The number of\nmembers of committee with executive powers should not be more than 4 to 5 and advisory committees\nshould be limited to 7 to 8 members. The reasonable number of committees will help in taking\ndecisions quickly.\n16.22 SUMMARY\nLine organisation is the simplest type of organisation where the authority is embedded in the hierarchial\nstructure and it flows in a direct line from the top of the managerial hierarchy down to different levels\nof managers and subordinates and down to the operative level of workers. It clearly identifies authority,\nresponsibility and accountability at each level.\nLine type of organisation, the functional specialists are added to the line, giving the line the advantages\nof specialists. This type of organisationis most common in our business economy and specially\namong large enterprises. Staff is basically advisory in nature and usually does not posses any command\nauthority over line managers.\nLine and staff structure is based on the assumption that both will help and support each other. But\noften there are conflicts between the two and both accuse each other. There is a lack of understanding\nand both try to dominate each other.\nAll the complaints of both line and staff personnel are based on lack of understanding. These conflicts\nare not based on ideologies. Proper demarcation of their fields and mutual trust can help in improving\nthe efficiency of both line and staff personnel. While many organisations have been successful due to only one person at the top making decisions,\ncommittees and task forces have become more and more necessary as the organisation grows into\ncomplexity. Because of collective information and analysis, committees are more likely to come up\nwith solutions to complex problems.\nGroups and committees have become an integral part of most organisations operations. Some of the\ndisadvantages of committees can be eliminated and the committees can become more efficient and\neffective if some guidelines are established.\n16.23 SELF ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\nEssay type\n1.

Effective and successful leadership leads an\norganisation to achieve goals. Good leadership is essential for the success of a business because of\n(i) imperfect organisational structure\n(ii) occurrence of fast technical, economic and social changes,\n(iii) internal imbalances due to growth\n(iv) human nature and behaviour and\n(v) psychological reasons\n17.2 MEANING\nLeadership is the process of influencing the behaviour of the people. Leaders are the moving spirits\nand guiding starts of inspiration to their followers. A leader interprets the objectives of the business,\nsuggests course of actions and guides people to achieve the set objectives. He seeks active support\nand acceptance of the employees in the following the proposed course of action.

It is the human factor which binds a group together and motivates it towards goals\u201d.\nThus leadership is the process of influencing the activities of an individual or a group for goal\nachievement in a given situation.\nGeorge R. Terry \u201cLeadership is the activity of influencing people of strive willingly for group objectives\u201d.\nThis definition puts a direct emphasis on willingness on the part of the people led.\nKoonl z and O\u2019 Donnel have defined \u201cLeadership as influencing people to follow the achievement of\na common goal. It is the ability to exert interpersonal influence by means of communication towards\nachievement of a goal\u201d.\n17.3 NATURE OF LEADERSHIP\n(i) A leader must have followers. Lead whom? Leadership does not exist in vacuum. Leadership\ncannot exist without a group of followers.\n(ii) Leadership is a working relationship between the leader and his followers. This means that the\nleader must be an active participant in the activities of the group.\n(iii) The purpose of leadership is to achieve some common goal or goals. The process of influence\nand interaction is rational in the sense that it is goal - directed.\n(iv) A leader influences his followers willingly not try force or coercion. Leadership is not a bossism. A\nleader shows the way by his own example.\n(v) Leadership is a social interaction - influence process between the leader and his followers. It is an\ninterpersonal process of influencing behaviour. (vi) Leadership is a power relationship in which power and influence are unevenly distributed.\n(vii) Leadership is a continuous and dynamic process of influencing behaviour. It is also a psychological\nprocess.\n17.4 FUNCTIONS OF A LEADER\n17.4.1. Creation of objectives: He creates the objectives and policies to lead the attention and\nefforts of his group in purposeful direction.\n17.4.2. Establishment of organisation: He brings into existence the organisation to serve as the\nvehicle to accomplish the predetermined objectives and policies.\n17.4.3. Playing dominant role in action: He initiates the various activities to promote the interests\nof the enterprise.\n17.4.4. Directing and motivating the subordinates: He directs and stimulates his subordinates to\nwork for the accomplishment of the enterprise goals and objectives. By issuing clear, complete and\nconcise orders, he presents his followers with a challenge which they take pride in meeting effecitvely.\n17.4.5 Connection between management and workers: He interprets the management policies\nand programmes to his subordinates and represents the subordinates interest before the management.\nQualities of a good Leader\n(i) Must have a good physical and mental personality.\n(ii) Stability in his emotions.\n(iii) Thorough understanding and better judgement and far sightedness.\n(iv) Balanced approach and well behaved.\n(v) Ability to guide and motivate subordinates.\n(vi) Excellent communicating skill\n(vii) Must be social\n(viii) Technical superiority with sound general education and expertise.\n(ix) Sincere, honest and fair indealing.\n(x) Corrage to accept responsibility.\n17.5 IMPORTANCE OF LEADERSHIP\nMore failures of business concerns are attributable to poor leadership than any other cause. This\nemphasises the importance of leadership in achieving the organisational goals.\n17.5.1 Determination of goals: A leader carries out the creative function of laying down goals and\npolicies for the followers.\n17.5.2 Organisation of activities: A good leader divides organisational activities among the employees\nin a systematic way. It helps to reduce the chance of comflict between them.\n17.5.3 Accomplishment of coordination: A leader directs and unifies the efforts of the individuals\nof a group for the accomplishment of roganisational goals. 17.5.4 Providng guidance: A good leader guides the subordinates and is available for advice\nwhenever they face any problem.\n17.5.5 Building employees morale: A good leader builds employees morale which in turn ensures\nhigh productivity and stability in the organisation.\n17.5.6 Facilitating change: Dynamic leadership is the corner-stone of organisational change. A\ndynamic leader can facilitate change as he is able to overcome resistance to change on the part of\nthe employees.\n17.6 LEADERSHIP STYLES\nLeadership style refers to a leaders behaviour. Behaviour pattern which the leader reflects in his role\nas a leader is often described as the sytle of leadership. It is the result of the philosophy, personality\nand experience of the leader.\n17.6.1. Autocratic or Authoritarian Leaders: Under the autocratic leadership style (a) all decision\nmaking powers are centralised in the leader. (b) Leaders are dictators. (c) Leaders do not entertain\nany suggestions or initiative from subordinates. (d) They give orders and assign tasks without taking\nsubordinates into confidence. (e) Leaders generally attract the hospitality of the subordinates.\nAUTOCRATIC LEADER\nFollower Follower Follower\nA B C\nFig. 17.2 Leadership styles: Autocratic leader\nActually an autocratic leader is, no leader. He is merely the formal head of his organisation. Workers\nunder him feel harassed and disturbed and prepare themselves of offer resistance.\n17.6.2 Democratic leader: (a) The democratic leadership style favours decision - among by the\ngroup. (b) He can win the cooperation of his group. (c) He can motivate them effectively and positively.\n(d) number of complaints, employees\u2019 greivances, industrial unrest and strikes can be reduced.\n(e) The decisions of the democratic leader are not unilateral.\nB\nE A C\nD\nFig: 17.3 Partcipative Leadership Style Participation, consultation and agreement of the group members are important features of democratic\nleadership. Democratic functioning can at times be dilatory and subject to pulls and pressures from\ndifferent groups. But considering the advantages offerred by it, the weaknesses of the system are\nquite insignificant.\n17.6.3. Laiseez - Faire or Free - Rein Leader:\nA free rein leader does not lead, but leaves the group entirely to itself.\nleader allows maximum freedom to subordinates.\nThey are given a free hand in deciding their own policies and methods.\nThe leader acts as an empire and co-ordinator of information.\nThis type of leadership style is also known as the \u201cpermissive style of leadership, where there is least\nintervention by the leader.\nA\nB C\nD E\nFig: 17.4 Free rein Leadership style\nThis type of direction can produce good results if the suboridnates are highly educated. Free rein\nleadership style is considered better than the autoritarian style. But it is not so effective as the\ndemocratic style.\n17.6.4. Intellectual or functional leader: An intellectual or functional leader commands no authority\nin the formal sense of the term. But because of his technical knowledge and professional skills, many\npersons in the organisation look up to him for guidance and leadership.\nEx: Chemist, engineer, accoutnant, specialist in personnel matters can be regarded as intellectual or\nfunctional leaders.\n17.6.5 Institutional leader: An institutional leader is one who, because of the prestige or privileges\nassociated with his office, compels obedience from his subordinates. He may not be an expert in his\nfield of activity, but his subordinates have to carry out his wishes.\n17.6.6 Paternatistic leader: A paternalistic leader is one who because of his sentimental or emotional\napproach to things, is greatly concerned with the comfort and welfare of his subordinates. The thought\nof providing protection to them is uppermost in his mind. Though well - meaning and well - intentioned, such a leader may not be liked by his subordinates for\nthe simple reason that under him, their growth and advancement tend to get stifled. He is like that\ntree which gives protection to all about under which nothing can grow.\n17.7 THEORIES OF LEADERSHIP\n17.7.1 Trait Theory: This theory described by Kelly (1974) attempts to classify what personal\ncharactristics such as physical, personality and mental, are associated with leadership success. Trait\ntheory relies on research that relates various traits to the success of a leader. A lengthy list of traits\nhas been made to describe an effective leader in terms of certain characteristics.\nClassification of traits:\n1. Physical characteristics of the leader, such as age, height, weight.\n2. Background characteristics - education, social status, mobility and experinece.\n3. Intelligence - ability, judgement, knowledge.\n4. Personality - aggressiveness, alertness, dominance, decisiveness.\n5. Task oriented characteristics - achievement need, responsibility, initiative, persistence.\n6. Social characteristics, supervisory ability, cooperativeness, popularity, prestige, tact, diplomacy.\nStudies are researches prove that persons possessing above traits could became successful leaders.\nTrait theory suffers from the following weakness:\n1. It has not been possible to identify universal or specific traits common to all leaders.\n2. It does not make clear as to how much of any trait a person should have.\n3. It emphasises mainly the personal traits and does not consider environment.\n4. There cannot be generalisation of traits for a successful leader.\n5. Trait studies describe, but do not analyze, behaviour patterns.\n17.7.2 Behavioural Theory of Leadership: According to the behavioural approach, leadership is a\nfunction of effective role behaviour. An effective leader is are who performs those acts which help the\ngroup to achieve its objectives.Behavioural theory is based on three main models.\na. The Michigan Studies\nb. The Ohio State University studies\nc. Mouton\u2019s Managerial Grid.\nThe Michigan Studies: Michigan researchers identified two leadership styles i.e. employee centred\nleader and production centred leader. A supervisor is considered as employee-centred if he allows\nthe employees to handle most of the problems themselves. Production-oriented supervisor is\nconcerned more with the task than with the people who perform the task. Table 17.1\nEmployee-centred leader Production centred leader\n1. Treats employees as human beings 1. Treats employees as tools in the production\nprocess.\n2. Shows concern for the welfare of workers 2. Emphasises production targets and technical\naspects of the job\n3. Encourages and involves employees 3. Exercises close supervision and control.\nin decision making\nOhio State University Studies: This studies identified the leadership behaivour - consideration and\ninitiating structure. Consideration (C) refers to mutual trust, friendship and warmth between the leader\nand his staff. Initiating Structure (IS) implies the degree to which the activities of subordinates are\ndefined and work procedures are established. The researchers used a Leader Opinion Questionnaire\n(LOQ) to systematise leader\u2019s self-perception of the leadership style.

It is a positive exchange between the\nleader and followers in order achieve group objectives. It is a two-way influence relationship. It indicates\nthat subordinates affect leaders and their behaviours as much as leaders and their behaviours affect\nsubordinates.\nAccording to this leadership is an exchange process between the leader and followers.

Followers Characteristics: Important features to consider are the followers nature, his out look,\nneeds, expeirnece, goals, values etc.\nc. Characteristics of the situation: A leader should consider the complexity, cultural climate, time\npressure, social impact, practicality of style, and new changes in the outer enviornment. d.

It is unrealistic to expect a uniform leadership style. From this point of view, the Indian\norganisations can be classified into the following three categories.\n(a) Family - managed traditional organisations.\n(b) Professionally - managed Indian organisations and foreign-owned organisations.\n(c) Public sector organisations.\nAs all these organisations are of different in nature, they have some distinct leadership styles.\n(a) Family-managed Traditional Organisations\nIn these organisations the most prevalent style is autocratic. Sons and grandsons of the enterpreneurs\nare automatically promoted without any consideration to efficiency or overall suitability. Thus there is\nmanagement by inheritance or management by chromosomes.As a reuslt, these organisations\nbecomes highly centralised in their structure and remain authoritarian in their approach. (b) Professionally - managed Indian organisations and Foregin - owned organisations\nThere are many organisations in the private section owned by Indian or multinationals who have\nappreciable degree of participation like the democratic leadership.The reason is that multinationals\nbring not only thier technology but also the work culture which is more permissive and conducive for\nthe application of modern approach of management. As such the degree of participation is very high\nin such organisation.\n(c) Public sector organisations\nOwing to the work culture inherited by public sector managers, bureaucratic style is more prevalent\nin the public sector organisations. Initially, public sector organisations were manned by civil servants\nwho brought a lot of bureaucratic culture with them. The net result is that all of the organisational\nprocesses are governed by the bureaucratic model. Its implications are: status differentials, class\ndistinctions, and impersonal relationships which work against the participative style.\nMost Indian top managers are relatively authoritarian in their relationship with lower management\nand labour. They are also employee oriented on account of Indian cultural and religious pattern.\nThen, what is the right leadership style for Indian managers is something that is difficult to answer. It\nall depends on numerous variables such as superiors, subordinates, and the situation under which a\npartiuclar style is followed.\n17.9 SUMMARY\nLeadership refers to the quality of the behaviour of individuals, where by they guide people on their\nactivities in organised efforts. Leadership must have the \u201cDo as you say\u201d which requires motivating\neffects on the part of the leader. Competent leadership can help in integrating the human effort and\nthier utilisation for constructive purpose. Autocratic, Consultative and Free-Rein are the three basic\nleadership styles. In nutshell, it can be said that it is an inter-personal, social and continuous process\nwhich influences group of persons towards a desired god.\n17.10 KEY WORDS\n1. Leadership: Leadership is the process of directing and influencing the task related activities of the\ngroup members.\n2. Transformational Leaders: These leaders convert or change the positions of the followers. They\ntransform the status of subordinates from good to better and bad to good.\n3. Traits Approach: This approach seeks to distinguish leaders from non leaders, based on the\nqualities and traits of the individuals.\n4. Behavioural Appraoch: This live of thought on leadership opines that some behavioural patterns\nor styles do differnetiate leaders from non-leaders.\n5. Contingency Approach: This approach says that leadership is situational. Hence it differs from\nsituation to situation.\n17.11 SELF - ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1. Define leadership.

In the course of direction, the manager has\nto try to create in his subrdinates the willingness to pursue organisational goals.\nMotivation inspires the workforce and creates confidence among them. Motivation deals with actuating\nthe people to work for the accomplishment of enterprise goals.\n18.2 MEANING AND CONCEPT\nMotivation may be regarded as set of those wishes, desires, need and drives which stimulate or\nactivate individual to act. Man is said to be motivated when his concealed energy is directed towards\nthe accomplishment of certain goals. So from thus we can say motivation is the willingness of individuals\nto carry out plans more enthusiastically for achieving organisational goals.

Centre for Distance Education 18.3 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n18.4 IMPORTANCE OF MOTIVATION\nManagmeent has to create \u201cwill to work\u201d among the subordinates. Thus, every superior in the\norganisation should motivate his subordinates for right types of behaviour.\na. Helps in realising organisational goals: Motivated employees cooperate voluntarily with the\nmanagement and thus contribute their maximum towards the organisational goals.\nb. Helps in increasing productivity: Motivation brings about satisfaction to employees, they work\nwhole-heartedly. This results in increased productivity.\nc. Helps in reducing employees turnover and absenteeism: The rate of turnover and absenteeism\ncomes down an account of the attractive motivational schemes.\nd. Helps in maintaining good industiral relations: A proper system or motivation reduces friction\namong the employees and betwene the employees and the management. This results in good industrial\nrelations between the management and the employees.\ne. Helps in getting right personnel: Attractive motivational schemes help in attracting highly talented\nand competent persons from external sources.\nf. Helps in reducing employees grievances: Good motivational schemes also help in reducing the\nnumber of complaints and grievances.\ng. Motivation: Carrot and Stick Approach: Desired behavioural pattern in the individual can be\nobtained in a positive or negative manner. If the person responds to positive motivations like: rewards,\nself discipline, promotions, transfers etc. It is called motivation due to carrots. Similarly, if the needed\nbehaviour in the subordinate is brought about by negative measures like threats, force, compulsions,\nundue influence, punishments, coercion etdc. It is motivation due to strick approach. It is all situational\nand a combination of the two also may be a good strategy.\n18.5 HOW TO MOTIVATE\n* by recognising the individual differences\n* by matching the jobs with the people (or) vice-versa\n* by using goals individualising the rewards.\n* by linking rewards to performance\n* by formulating goods personnel policies.\n* by adopting decentralisation and delegation of authority where ever it is needed.\n* by maximising job satisfaction by job enrichment.\n* by following systems like MBO and MBWA.\n* by rewarding frankness and openess. Centre for Distance Education 18.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n* by encouraging creativity of the personnel.\n* by creating good organisational cutlrue,climate and health.\n* by improving employee morale etc.\n18.6 WHAT DOES DEMORALISE?\nSome times, motivational and morale aspects in an organisations are very poor due to some practices\nunwarranted.hence,it will be good, if they are avoided.\na. Under assignments to people capable of doing though and takes of responsibility and risk.\nb. Over assignemtns to people beyond the capacity and commettence.\nc. Buckmastership: It is a practice where some superiors avoid doing hard works, pass it on to the\nlower level people and pending fault with them. This practice erodes employee motivation.\nd. Managers must not be manipulative and cohesive in their attitudes.\n18.6.1. Motivation Vs. Demotivation: To motivate the subordinates and know the climate and\natmosphere in the campus of the organisations, this distinction is highly needed.\nWhen is one said to be motivated?\n* One comes ot work willingly\n* One gives the best of one\u2019s efforts at work.\n* One has sense of belongingness and pride in associating with the organisation job.\n* One is very much committed to work etc.\n18.6.2 Demotivation is underestood from\n* high rates of absenteeism and personnel turn - over\n* curtailed output / productivity\n* increased number of accidents\n* high wastages / defectives\n* heavy loss due to bad handling\n* rank indislipine\n* frustrated workforce\n* defiant and violent behaviour\n* frequent confrontation and arguments with supervisors etc.\nDemotivation causes variations in the behaviour of subordinates.

Vroom\u2019s Expectancy Thoery\n8. Alderfer\u2019s ERG Theory\n18.7.1 Maslow\u2019s Need Priority Model: Abraham Maslow\u2019s need-hierarchy theory is one of\nthe most popular and widely known theories of motivation. According to Maslow, people are motivated\nto satisfy five categories of needs. They are\nPsychological needs\nSafety needs\nSocial needs\nEsteem needs Centre for Distance Education 18.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nSelf-actualisation needs\nWhich is represented through the following diagram\nSelf - Actualisation Needs\nEco Needs\nSocial Needs\nSafety Needs\nPsychological Needs\nFig. 18.3 Maslow\u2019s Need Hierarchy\n(i) Psychological needs: includes the need for food, water air and sex.\n(ii) Safety needs: Includes the need for security and stability as well as freedom from fear or threat.\n(iii) Social needs: includes need for friendship, affection acceptance and interaction with othes.\n(iv) Esteem needs: includes both a need for personal feelings of achievement or self-esteem and a\nneed for recognition or respect from others.\n(v) Self-actualisation needs: includes feelings of self-fulfillment and the realisation of one\u2019s potential.\nMaslow contended that a \u201clower\u201d need must be realatively satisfied before the next \u201chigher\u201dneed can\nmotivate the person.\nFor Ex: A person\u2019s safety needs would have to be generally satisfied before the next level of need\ncan motivate his behaviour.\nMaslow believed that the drive to self actualise was universal, but that it is only rarely reached and\nnever fully fulfilled. Centre for Distance Education 18.7 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n18.7.1 (i) Merits or utility of Maslow\u2019s Classification of Needs\n(a) Maslow\u2019s theory suggested the priority and nature of needs.\n(b) This concept of needs is important for understanding the managerial task inrelation of human\nresources working in organisation.\n(c) Maslow\u2019s approach is direct, simple and practical.\n(d) He pointed out that this hierarchy of needs is not rigid and fixed in order and it is not the same for\nall individual.\n18.7.1 (ii) Weaknesses of Maslow\u2019s Theory:\nIt is a general expression not specific. The levels in the hierarchy are not rigidly fixed. The boundaries\nbetween them are hazy and overlapping.\nIt does not have any allowance for exceptions. This approach overlooks the interaction of needs.\n18.7.2 Frederick Herzberg\u2019s Two Factor Theory:\nThis is also another needs theory Herzberg concentrated on two factors to explain employees\nmotivation.\nManagers have viewed job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction as opposite ends. Herzberg suggested\nthat the opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction but simply \u201cno satisfaction:.\nTwo factors of Herzberg are:\n(i) Motivators i.e. factors that produced job satisfaction. It includes achievement, recognition,\nresponsibility, advancement and personal growth.\n(ii) Dissatisfiers led due to dissatisfaction in the job called as \u201cHygienes\u201d which includes company\npolicies and administration, supervision, working conditions pay and job security.\nHerzberg\u2019s two factor theory can be explained in the following figure.\nBased on this Herzberg concluded that only motivators produce job satisfaction, where as hygienes\nmerely prevent job dissatisfaction.

Rather today\u2019s employees are likely to be motivated by higher level needs such as\nesteem and self-actualisation.\nTable 18.2\nMaslow Vs Hergberg Models\nBasis Maslow Model Hergberg Model\nNature of Theory Descriptive Prescriptive\nUnsatisfied needs Satisfied needs\nProposition\nmotivate persons regulate behaviour\nAny need can be a\nMotivator Only higher needs act as\nmotivator,if it is not met\nmotivators\nApplicability It applies to all workers It applies upper\nmanagerial personnel\nCategories\nIt has five levels of needs It has two classes of\nfactors Centre for Distance Education 18.10 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n18.7.3 MC Gregor\u2019s Theory X and Theory Y: Mc Gregor developed \u201cTheory X\u201d and\n\u201cTheory Y\u201d to explain human behaviour. He made two sets of assumptions which are quite opposite\nto one another.\nThe first set of assumption he called as \u201cTheroy X\u201d considered to be traditional, autocratic and\nnegative in approach,\nWhile the second set of assumption better known as \u201ctheory y\u201d is based on accomplishment, self\nmotivation and is positive in approach.\n18.7.3 (i) Theory X Assumptions:\na. Workers have an aversion to work.\nb. Workers have an inherent dislike of work and will avoid it, if possible.\nc. Workers try to find a way to postpone the work of completion\nd. Workers may do the job half-heartedly.\ne. Fear of punishment can motivate the workers into action.\nf. Workers are not ready to accept responsibility.\ng. Most workers have little creativity.\nh. A workers prefers to be directed by others.\ni. A workers avoids taking decisions.\nj. Workers are normally passive, even resistent to organisational needs.\nThe assumptions regarding human nature that man is by nature lazy, lacks ambition, dislikes\nresponsibility prefers to be led and that he is self-centred, indifferent to organisational goals, resistive\nto change are negative assumptions. In order to achieve objectives, therefore, the managers must\nadopt coersive attitude, close supervision and tight control. People can be motivated by monetary\nincentives and threat of punishment. Theory X is regarded as the means to supervise and control the\nworkers.\n18.7.3 (ii) Theory Y Assumptions:\na. The average human being does not inherently dislike work. Human being has tendency to work.\nb. Work may be a source of satisfaction to the employee.\nc. Workers extend full co-operation for job completion.\nd. Workers has self-direction, self-motivation, self-discipline and self control.\ne. Workers are ready to accept extra responsibility.\nf. Workers has competence to work and can take right decisions.\ng. A work may exhibit his efficiency even for non monetary rewards. Centre for Distance Education 18.11 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nTheory Y thus assumes that people by nature are not lazy and unreliable. They enjoy work, are\nambitious and want to do work. They have potentials for development, capacity for assuming\nresponsibility and will do work. People are motivated by self-control and self-development. This theory\nis based on optimistic and dynamic nature of human behaviour.\nFrom the above, one can easily understand that superior should definitely be an autocratic manager\nto motivate the subordinates, in an autocratic manner as the mission of the management is achievement\nof organisational goals.\nTable 18.3\nComparision between Theory X and Theory Y\nTheory X Theory Y\n1. Inherent dislike for work 1. Work is natural like rest or play.\n2. Unambitious and prefer to be 2. Ambitious and capable of directing their\ndirected by others own behaviour.\n3. Avoid responsibility 3. Accept and seek responsibility under\nproper conditions.\n4. Lack creativity and resist change 4. Creativity widely spread.\n5. Focus on lower level needs to motivate 5. Both lower level and higher order needs\nworkers. are sources of motivation\n6. External control and close supervision 6. Self-direction and self control are\nrequired to achieve organisational objectives required to objectives.\n7. Autocratic Leadership 7. Democratic Leadership\n8. People lack self-motivation 8. People are self-motivated\n18.7.4 Theory Z: William Ouchi developed theory z after making comparitive study of Japanese\nand American management practices. It is an integrated model of motivation. Z type of organisations\nhas three major features. They are\na. Mutual trust between members of organisation reduces conflict and leads team work.\nb. Subtlety requires sensitivity towards others and it yields higher productivity.\nc. Intimacy implies concern, support and disciplined unselfishness.\nCriticism\n1. This theory based on Japanese management practices.This management may not be suitable to\nother organisations having different culture. Centre for Distance Education 18.12 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n2. Thereis lack of empirical research to confirm the practical utility of this theory.\n3. This theory does not provide guidelines as to at what point of time it may be applied in any\norganisation.\n4. There may be some operational problems in implementing Theory Z.\n18.7.5 Mc Clelland\u2019s need for achievement theory: This is another needs theory. He classified\nall human needs into three categories viz., need for power, need for affiliation, and need for\nachievement. His philosophy is that all these needs are of herculian importance to make the organised\nenterprise work well while saying that the need for achievement is of paramount significance.\n18.7.6 Adams Equity Theory: There are two main variables in this theory i.e. inputs and outcomes.\nInputs are the contributions which an individual perceives that he puts into his job.\nOutcomes are the rewards which the individual receives from the organisation and from his job.\nInputs and outcomes are thus important elements in the exchange relationship between the\norganisation and its members. When the individual feels that the outcomes he receives from the\norganisation are fair in terms of his inputs he is satisfied and motivated. The person compares his\ninput outcome ratio with the input-output ratio of other members of his level or status in the organisation.\nHe is likely to reduce/increase his input of effect to create equity.\nEquity = Persons outcomes/persons inputs = others outcomes / others inputs.\nThe main postulates of the equity theory:\n(a) Perceived inequity creates tension in the individual.\n(b) The amount of tension is proportional to the magnitude of the inequity.\n(c) The tension created in the individual motivates him to reduce it.\n(d) The degree of motivation is proportional to the perceived inequity.\n18.7.7 Vroom\u2019s Expectancy Theory: Victor H. Vroom is a psychologist. This theory is based on\nthe belief that people will act to maximise their rewards. In this theory motivation is determined by\na. Expectency: The belief that the effort will be rewarded.\nb. Valence: The value attached to specific needs.\nExpectency can be separated into two types.\nExpectency 1 is the belief that effort will lead to performance. An individual can perform well if efforts\nare made.\nExpectancy 2 is the belief that the performance will lead to rewards.\nValence the second factor of motivation, is the value based on a reward. It can be either positive or\nnegative. The more positive the value the person will be highly motivated.\nThe more the negative value, the less likely a person will be motivated. Centre for Distance Education 18.13 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nThe above theory can be explained diagramatically.\nPERFORMANCE WILL BE\nEFFORT WILL LEAD\nREWARDED\nTO PERFORMANCE\nEXPECTANCY 1 EXPECTANCY 2\nEFFORTS PERFORMANCE REWARDS\nFig. 18.6\nMerits\n1. In case of expectancy 1, that the employees fell that the expected performance is attainable, by\nsetting performance objectives.\n2. In case of expectancy 2, that the desired performance is clearly linked with rewards cause high\nmotivation.\nIn case of valence rewards are meaningful to employees, by understanding individual employee\nneeds, managers can match them to rewards for maximum motivation.\nCriticism\nEven though it is considered one better theories of motivation, it has certain its own limitations.\na. Expectancy theory is very complex in nature.\nb. Practical application is difficult.\nc. Attempt to calcualte expectancy 1. Expectancy 2 is doubtful.\nd. Valence estimates in making decisions are difficult.\ne. Complexity of expectancy theory also makes it difficult to test.\n18.7.8 Porter - Lawler - Expectancy Model: This model is an improvement over the valence.\nExepctancy model. Porter and Lawler applied this model to the study of the behaviour of managers\nand concluded that there exists a complex relationship between job attitudes and job performance.\nThis theory tried to explore the relationship between motivation, satisfaction and performance. This\ncan be explained through a diagram.

One must be motivated if he is willing to perform the assigned task.\n2. For this purpose he must have necessary skill and traits.\nHe must have an accurate knowledge of the job requirements.\n(i) Elements of Porter - Lawler Model: Satisfaction and performance are separate variables.\nEffort refers to amount of energy exerted by an individual on a given task.\nPerceived-reward probability refers to the individuals perception of the probability that different rewards\ndepend upon differential amount of effort.\nPerformance: Effort leads to performance but two are not equal.\nRewards are two kinds (i) Intrinsic rewards - such as a sense of self-actualisation and (ii) Extrinsic\nrewards. Such as working conditions and status.\nSatisfaction is derived from the extent to which the actual award falls short or meets or exceeds the\nperceived reward. Centre for Distance Education 18.15 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n(ii) Implication of the theory: Motivation is not a simple cause effect relationship rather is a complex\nphenomenon. Porter and Lawler suggested that managers should carefully assess their reward\nstructure through carefull planning and careful definition of role requirements, the effort performance\n- reward satisfaction system should be integrated into on overall system of managing.\n(iii) Elements of sound motivational system: While adopting a motivational system. The following\nimportant considerations should be kept in mind.\na. Adequateness: The motivational system should be adequate covering the entire workforce in an\norganisation and it should cover all the activities of the employees.\nb. Flexibility: The motivational system should be flexible enough to enable changes to be incorporated.\nc. Related to efforts: The motivational system should be directly related to efforts. There should be\npositive interconnection between efforts and rewards.\nd. Analysis of motives: A sound motivational system also analyses the factors which motivate the\nemployees in the prevailing organisational environment.\ne. Simplicity: The motivational system should be simple to be well understood by the employees as\nit is designed for them.\nf. Blending: A sound motivational system should be a fine blending of the requirements of the\nemployees, the objectives, and the philosophy of the organisation.\n18.8 TYPES OF INCENTIVES\nThe needs of individuals are varied and different. Some of them can be satisfied by money, while\nothers cannot be satisfied by money alone. On the basis of this, the incentives can be either in\nmonetary or in non-monetary form.\nIncentives\nFinancial Incentives Non - Financial Incentives\nIndividual Collective Individual Collective Institutional\nVarious premium 1.

It consists of\nwage payments, in excess of those paid to time rate workers, premiums, bonus, prizes and return on\ninvestments. Monetary incentives should have a relevance to the financial and social needs of the\nworkers.\n(ii) Non-Monetary Incentives: Non monetary incentives cannot be expressed in terms of money.\n(i) Individual Incentives:\n(a) Status: It is the ranking of positions, rights and duties in the organisation. Research indicated the\nfact that middle and higher level employees prefer escalations in status increments in pay.\n(b) Promotion: It is the vertical movement of a person in the organisation. Promotion are accompanied\nby increased responsibilities, enhanced prestige and power, usually since promotions depend on\ngood performance, most employees try to attain these if the organisation provides the opportunities.\n(c) Responsibility: People want to handle responsible and challenging jobs. If the job is responsible,\nit satisfied people in more than one way.\n(d) Recognition of work: Managerscan motivate people by using this in the ways. Show appreciation\nwhen an individual does an outstanding job; compliment individuals infront of others; compliment\nindividuals when the incident is still fresh in their mind. Recognition and appreciation will have a\n\u201ctonic\u201d effect on the psychology of employees.\n(e) Interesting work: Jobs that are varied, pleasant and enjoyable motivate people throughly. Such\njobs allow people to satisfy their natural mestincts. Work in such cases becomes as natural as play\na recreation and stimulates people to reach greater heights.\n(f) Job Security: People want to secure jobs. They want to be are about their future income and job\ncontinuity. For the same reason, people prefer government jobs to private jobs, where the security is\ngood but not the income.\n(ii) Collective incentives\n(i) Social importance of work: People want jobs of high social status. They are prepared to accept\nsuch jobs, even when the pay is comparatively less. High status jobs enhance the social status of an\nindividual in the society.\n(ii) Team Spirit: People prefer to work in well-knit groups. Those organisations that encourage their\nFig. 18.9 Relationship between morale and performance\nemployees to do the jobs in a cooperative manner, attract people automatically. When team spirit is\nencouraged among employees, they will put in their maximum in the service of the organisation.\n(iii) Healthy Competition: Promoting healthy competition among employees through carefully chosen\nreward schemes spurs people to work harder.\n(iii) Institutional Incentives:\n(a) Participation: People prefer organisations that offer them good opportunities to participate in the\ndecision making process. Participation enables people to offer valuable suggestions and concrete\nideas and see that these are actually translated into action. Centre for Distance Education 18.17 Acharya Nagarjuna University\n(b) Sound Human Relations: A positive work climate where people are treated as human beings is\nan important reward. It permits people to work with enthusiasm and spirit and contribute their best.\n(c) Morale: Morale refers to the atmosphere created by the attitude of the members of an organisation.\nPoor morale is an organisational malady. The warning signals to be noted here are in the form of\nabsenteeism, high turnover, strikes and sabotage, lack of pride in work etc.\n(d) Communication and Discipline: Proper communication and good disciplinary procedures enables\npeople to work with confidence and along the prescribed routes. The behaviour is consistent with\ngoals and the changes of meeting the goals are high.\n18.9 MORALE AND PERFORMANCE\nMorale and job performance go hand in hand. The higher the morale the better the performance and\nvice-versa. The workers with high morale do not skip work, show good team spirit and contribute\ntheir best to the attainment of the organisational objectives. But thus is not always true. Increase in\nmorale does not guarantee a proportianate increase in performance. It is quite possible to increase\nmorale with either favourable or infavourable shifts in performance as shown in the following figure.\ne\nc\nn\nonly erform a\ne P\nal\nh\nr g\no Hi\nM d elaroM\nan\nh\ng e\nHi oral\nM\nnly\nHigh m a n c e o\nHig h p e rf o r\nPerformance\n18.9.1 Morale and performance relationship\n(i) High morale and high performance\n(ii) High morale and low performance\n(iii) Low morale and low performance and\n(iv) Low morale and high performance\nIn the final analysis, a manager has to work for improving the morale of his employees. High morale\nmakes the work more pleasant and will go a long way in improving the work climate. It helps the work\ngroup to attain goals easily, smoothly and more importantly, in a highly cooperative manager.

It keeps the members of the organisation informed about internal\nand external happenings. Managers spend most of their working time in communicating with others.\nSo we can say good managers are good communicators and poor managers are poor communicators. 19.2 MEANING AND DEFINITION\nThe word \u2018communication\u2019 has been derived from the Latin word \u2018COMMUNIS\u2019, which means\n\u2018COMMONS\u2019. Communication, actually stands for the sharing of information, an idea or an attitude in\ncommon. Communication is a process of transmitting information from one person to another and a\nmeans by which organised activity is justified.\nCommunication is the transfer of infromation and understanding from one person to another. Thus,\ncommunication is an exchange of information between two or more persons, where information is\ndefined as any sign, symbol or signal used by one person to achieve the desired effect in the behaviour\nof another person.\nAccording to Keith Davis \u201cCommunication is the process of passing information and understanding\nfrom one person to another\u201d.\nCyrin Hudson says \u201cCommunication is its simplest form is a conveying of information from one\nperson to another\u201d.\nAccording to the American Management Association Communication is \u201cany behaviour that results\nin an exchange of menaing\u201d.\nAccording to Charles Redfield, \u201ccommunication is the broad field of human interchange of facts and\nopinions and not the technologies of telephone, telegraph, radio and the like\u201d.\n19.3 NATURE OF COMMUNICATION\n(i) It involves atleast two persons: Communication involves atleast two persons, a sender and a\nreceiver. The sender is called communication and the receiver of the message is known as\ncommunicateee. A person who speaks, writes or issues some instructions is the sender and the\nperson for whom the communication is meant or who receives the meassage is the receiver or\ncommunicatee.\n(ii) There must be a meassage: A meassage is the subject matter of communication, e.g the contents\nof letter or speech, order, instructions or the suggestions.A communication must convey some\nmessage.\n(iii) Message may be written or oral: Communication is generally understood as spoken or written\nwords. It includes everything that may be used to convey meanings from one person to another.\n(iv) It is a two way process: It involves both information and understanding. Communication is not\ncomplete unless the receiver has understood the message properly and his reaction or response is\nknown to the sender.\n(v) Primary purpose is to motivate a response: The primary purpose of communication is to\nmotivate a response or influence human behaviour.\n(vi) It may be formal or informal: Formal communication follows the formal channels provided in\nthe organisation structure. In formal communication, there is no direct communication between the\nmanaging director and the accounts clerks. Informal communication flows from informal channels of\ncommunication which are not provided in the organisation structure. Those channels develop among\nmembers because of personal contacts through working with each other. (vii) Flows top and down and also from side to side: Communication flows downward from a\nsuperior to subordinates and upward from subordinate to a superior. It also flows between two or\nmore persons operating at the same level of authority.\n(viii) An integrated part of the process of exchange: It refers to the exchange of ideas, feelings,\nemotions, and knowledge and informations between two or more persons.\n19.4 OBJECTIVES OF COMMUNICATION\na. Sending the correct and right message: Communication is meant for conveying the right message\nto the right person. The message conveyed should be well understood, accepted,and translated into\npractice as well.\nb. Co-ordination: Communication serves as a tool to co-ordinate the efforts of all who are involved\nin running a business. Without communication co-ordination is a remote possibility.\nc. Helathy industrial relations: Communication aims at healthy industrial relations.\nd. Development of managerial skills: Communication is a learning process. Facts, informations,\nideas etc., enriches the knowledge of the executive who tries to make use of the acquired knowledge\nwhich results into an increase in his wisdom and skill.\ne. Effectiveness of policies and programmes: Policies and programmes of the enterprise need\ncommunication to those who are to execute them. Effectiveness of the policies can be judged from\nits success which depends on effective communication system.\nf. Boosting the morale: Productivity goes up and the cost of production shows a declining trend if\nthe communication is effective and workers have understood its letter and spirit.\n19.5 PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION\nCommunication is a process, a concept of change rathers than that of static existence. The various\nelements involved in this process are shown in the following figure.\nCommunication -- Message -- Encoding -- Channel -- Receiver -- Decoding\nFeedback\nFig 9.1 The Communication Process\n(i) Communicator: Is a person who conveys the message.\n(ii) Message: The subject matter of the communication. Ex: It may be opinion, order, appeal, views,\nsuggestions etc. (iii) Encoding: Subject matter of the communication is abstract and intangible, its transmission\nrequires the use of certain symbols (words, signs etc). The conversionof the subject - matter into\nthese symbols is known as encoding.\n(iv) Channel: The medium (radio, telephone, air etc) used to transmit the message is known as the\ncommunication channel.\n(v) Receiver: Is a person for whom the message is meant.\n(vi) Decoding: Decoding is the process by which the receiver converts the symbols received from\nthe communicator to derive the meaning of message.\n(vii) Feedback: Feedback is the reversal of the communication process in which a reaction to the\ncommunicators message is expressed.\n19.6 IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION\nIn the words of Norbert Wiener, \u201cCommunication is the cement that makes organisation\u201d. No\norganisation can think of its existence without effective communication. \u201cThe first executive function\nis to develop and maintain a system of communication\u201d. The importance of communication can,\ntherefore, be judged from the following.\n1. Basis for decision making and planning: Communication is highly essential for planning and\ndecision making. It is an aid in the proper implementation of plans and policies of the management.\n2. Facilitates smooth working: Communication makes possible the smooth working of an\norganisation. Terry states that \u201cCommunication serves as the lubricant, fostering the smooth operations\nof the management process\u201d.\n3. Facilitates coordination: Modern large sale enterprises comprising a large number of workers\ncan attain thier goals only through coordination of various activities. But coordination can be achieved\nonly through effective communication.\n4. Promotes Industrial Peace: Effective communication promotes industrial peace as it helps develop\nunderstanding between the superiors and the subordinates.\n5. Facilitates control: Communication helps the control process by transmitting information about\nthe performance of the subordinates to the manager.\n6. Basis of Leadership: Communication is the basis for establishing effective leadership as it helps\nin bringing the leader and the led in close contact with each other.\n7. Motivation: Effective communication helps in motivating workers for accomplishing the\norganisational goals.\n8. Job Satisfaction: Since effective communication creates mutual trust and confidence between\nthe employer and employees, it gives a sense of job satisfaction.\n9. Public relations: Effective communication promotes public relations as it helps the management\nto present a good corporate image to the outside world. 19.7 ELEMENTS OF COMMUNICATION\na. A communicator: The person who speaks out a sends or transmitts a written message.\nb. Transmission: The act of saying, sending or issuing the message.\nc. Message: The information, order, appeal, observation, instruction report etc that is communicated.\nd. The Receiver: The receiver, addressee, respondent, or audience to whom the message is\ncommunicated.\ne. Reply: Response or reaction of the communicatee.\n19.8 FORMS OF COMMUNICATION\nCommunication may be classified into several categories on the following basis.\nCommunication\nOn the basis of channel On the basis of expression\nFormal Informal oral written Gestural\non the basis of Direction\nDownward Upward Horizontal\nCommunication Commmunication Communication\nFig: 19.2 Forms of Communication 19.8.1 Channels of Communication:- A channel of communication represents various linking points\nthat exist between different departments or individuals in the enterprise. It is the path through which\ninformation is transmitted throughout the enterprise. It may be either formal or informal.\n19.8.2 Formal Communication:- Formal communication is one which takes place in a formal\norganisation structure. It represents the flow of information along the lives of authority formally\nestablished in the organisation. It usually takes the form of written communication.\nMerits of formal communication\na. It helps in the fixation of responsibility.\nb. It helps in maintaining the authority relationship in the organisation.\nc. It ensures orderly flow of information.\nd. It facilitates control by supervisors by providing timely information.\nDemerits of formal communication\na. It is time consuming\nb. It obstructs free and uninterrupted flow of information\nc. It is usually conveyed in an impersonal manner.\n19.8.3 Informal Communication or Grapevine Communication:- Informal communication is based\non informal relationship between the two parties the sender and the receiver. Informal communication\nis also known as grapevine. It is the primary source of upward communication. It transmits information\nabout what people are doing. It feels towards a particular situation or thinks about the management.\nProf. Keith Davis has identified four different network for transmitting information via the grapevien.\nThey are\n(i) Single strand\n(ii) Gossip chain\n(iii) Probability chain\n(iv) Cluster chain\n(i) Single stand: In the single strand, are person communicates with only one person.\n(ii) Gossip chain: In Gossip chain, every member talks with every one else, usually about personal\nmatter.\n(iii) Probability chain: In this communication is random.\n(iv) Cluster chain: In it messages are transmitted selectively. Grapevine generally operates like a\ncluster chain. For ex: If a person tells something to four or five persons, only one or two of them will\npass on the information to more than one person. As the number grows larger and the information\nbecomes older, it gradually dies out, because those who know it do not repeat it. This process is\ncalled cluster chain because each link in the chain tends to inform a cluster of other people instead of only one person. In the cluster chain only a few persons are active communicators and such persons\nare known as liaison agents. The above mentioned network can be seen in the following figures.\nE\nJ P\nD\nE L niahC\nniahC\nC\nytilibaborP\nS elgniS\nF\nG\nB\nK\nA\nA\nH\nD\nFig. 19.3\nV\nW U\nT\nX\nS\nY\nZ\nFig. 19.4 Gossip Chain Y U\nX V\nZ T\nFig. 19.5 Cluster Chain\nMerits of informal communication:\na. It helps to improve managerial decision making.\nb. It satisfies the desire of the people.\nc. It serves to fill the possible gaps in the formal communication.\nd. Its speed is very fast as it is free from all barriers.\nDemerits of informal information\na. It carries inacurate information.\nb. It consists of facts, half truths, rumours and ditorted information.\nc. The responsibility of its origin cannot be fixed.\nd. It leads to the leakage of confidential information.\n19.8.4 Communication on the basis of Direction: On the basis of direction, communication is\neither vertical or horizontal. Vertical communication moves both downward and upwards. Horitzontal\ncommunication takes place between two subordinates under the same superior or between two\ndepartmental managers.\n(i) Downward Communication: Under this method, communication flows from the superiors to the\nsubordinates, orders, instructions, circulars and manual are instances of this type of communication.\nDownward communication is best suited to the line organisation.\n(ii) Upward Communication: Upward communication is the opposite of the downward communication.\nIn it communication flows from the bottom of the organisation upward to the top of the organisation\nthrough middle managers along with the line. Reports, suggestions, complaints and grievances are\ninstances of this type of communication. (iii) Lateral (Horizontal) Communication: It refers to the flow of information between departments\nor people of equal level in an organisational structure. It may be written or oral. The two departments\nmay be under the same superior or may have different heads. The main object of lateral communication\nis to co-ordinate the efforts of different departments or persons.\n19.8.5 Communication on the baiss of expression:\n(i) Oral Communication: Transmission with the help of spoken words is oral communication. In it\nboth parties of the process exchange their ideas through oral words either in face to face, situation or\nthrough any devices such as telephones, mobile or wireless. meetings, lectures, interviews, counselling,\npublic address system, conferences are some other media of communication.\n(ii) Written communication: When communication is transmitted into black and white, it is called\nwritten communication. This includes wirtten words, graphs, diagrams, pictures, etc. A written\ncommunication becomes essential where oral communication is not possible either due to a large\nnumber of communicatees or due to wide geographical distances of the sender and receiver of the\ncommunications.\n(iii) Gestural Communication: Communication through gestures or postures is known as gestural\ncommunication. It is often used to supplement the oral communication. It conveys feelings, emotions,\nand attitudes, reactions and responses. When a manager shakes hands with the subordinates a pats\non his back, it conveys something important to subordinates.\n19.9 MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNICATION\nEffectiveness of communication can be evaluated by systematic approach in terms of stated objectives.\nAny assessment of communication, therefore, requires the determination and fixation of norms oriented\nto the basic objectives of the process itself. The effectiveness of communication can be assessed\nthrough the evaluation of the following elements.\n* Clarity: The message msut be as clear as possible. No ambiguity should be creep into it.\n* Adequacy: The adequacy of communication should be understood in terms of both coverage and\nquantity of various types of messages. The adequacy of coverage can be measured through a\ncommunication audit.\n* Timing: The utility of any message to the receiver is dependent on its timeliness. Thus the\ncommunication should not only ensure that the message reaches the receiver but also ensure that it\nreaches on time.\n* Integrity: It should be as far as possible be based on the policy of integration of efforts in order to\navoid confusion and achieve better understanding.\n19.10 BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION\nThe barriers to communication in an organisation may be broadly categorized into\n* Physical Barriers\n* Personal or Socio-psychological Barriers * Organisational Bbarriers\n* Semantic Barriers\n* Mechanical Barriers\n19.10.1 Physical Barriers: There are environmental factors that obstruct or reduce the sending\nand receiving of communication such as physical distance,distracting noises and other interferences.\nAs the physical distance increases communication of message becomes difficult.\n19.10.2 Personal or socio-psychological Barriers:\n(i) Psychological distance: Personal barriers are from motives, attitudes, judgements, emotions\nand social values of people. These may create psychological distance similar to physical distance.\n(ii) Individual differences: Persons differ in their motives, attiutdes or sentiments. Interpersonal\nperceptions or inter-personal emotions may cause breakdown because each perceives the thing in\nthe light of his own experinece, prejudices and thinking.\n(iii) Difference in Interest: The interest of people differs and so is their attitude. The ideas, questions,\nattitudes, feelings etc., of other party may present an obstacle to ones own personal goal. In the\nabsence of adeuqate self-confidence or for fear of relaliation are restrains the expression of his true\nfeelings.\n(iv) Division of people: Division of people into classes, castes and communities also affects\ncommunication of ideas and viewpoints.\n(v) Difference of view points: View points may differ and so communication suffers. An executive\nmay be harsh enough not to hear and accept others view point, whether right or wrong.\n19.10.3 Orgnaisational Barriers:\n(i) Hierarchical distance: The possibility of filtering the information is there when the manager\ndecides to pass only a part of the information received from below or above. In this way he may\ndeprive people at the bottom of the wishes of the executive at the top. Similarly it may keep the top\nexeuctive in dark from the happenings at the lowest level.\n(ii) Diversion: Sometimes a manager diverts the information meant for one person or group to\nanother.\n(iii) Colouring: The manager may colour the information, sometimes intentionally with view to twist\nthe situation in his favour or sometimes out of situation.\n(iv) Status Barriers: Status is a barirer of communication in a formal organisation. An executive in\nthe middle of management hierarchy, may worry much about what his senior bosses are thinking and\npay minimum attention to the thoughts of his juniors or subordinates. The subordinates are reluctant\nto communicate anything which their boss does not like. This may have negative effect on their\nrelationship. (v) Poor Supervision: When a superior suspects his subordinates or acts as a self-appointed censor\nor listens his subordinates with closed minds, the communication is blocked or when he thinks that\nhis subordinates are less competent and capable, they do not adivce superiors.\n19.10.4 Semantic Barirers:\n(i) Inferences: Inference may given a wrong signal, therefore one should be aware of them and\nappraise them carefully. More feedback should be sought in case of any doubt.\n(ii) Symbols: Symbols may be classified as language, picture or action. Their effect as barriers is\nimmense.\n(iii) Language: In verbal as well as in nonverbal communication words are the principle communication\ninstrument of all employees. Most of the time of managers and other executives is spent in verbal\ncommunication. In a face to face verbal communication, a clarification may be sought if doubts exist\nabout a particular word. But it is difficult in non verbal communication. Consequently, effective\ncommunication are idea contened rather than word-centred.\n(iv) Picture: Sometimes a picture may create confusion in the mind of an observer. This can be done\naway if-pictures are supplemented with well chosen words and actions to tell the whole story.\n(v) Action: Whatever we do or not do it is an action and effective means of communication to the\nextent it is interpreted by others. To do or not to do both have meaning.\n(vi) Body Language: Body language supplements to nonverbal communication. In interpersonal\ninteraction people communicate meanings to others with their bodies. Body language means\ncommunicating the message with the movement of the whole body or a part of it.\n19.10.5 Mechanical Barriers: Mechanical Barriers include inadquate arrangement for transmission\nof news, facts and figures. Poor office layouts, defective procedures and practices and the use of\nwrong media lead to poor communication.\n19.11 IMPACT OF BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION\nThe above barriers in effective communication of message vitiate the message in several ways such\nas -\n* Distortion of message: It means changing the context of the message or the meaning of the\nmessage.\n* Filtering: It means reducing the message only to a few basic details.\n* Omission: It represents deletion of all or part of the message.\n19.12 WAYS TO AVOID BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION\nFollowing ways are recommended to minimise the chances of distortion of communication.\n* Clarity of information: The language used in communication should be clear, precise and simple\nso that people at all levels realise the full significance of communication. * Prompt Action: Information should be passed promptly to every one concerned so as to avoid\ndelay in action.\n* Creation of proper atmosphere: The management should take all necessary steps to create a\npeaceful atmosphere in the organisation so as to facilitate effective communication of instructions\nand suggestions.\n* Development of interpersonal relationships: As communication is an interpersonal process.\nThe development of interpersonal relationships based on mutual respect, trust and confidence is\nessential for its promotion.\n* Effective channels: There will be no room for rumours, lies, guesses and misconceptions, if the\ncommunication channel is well defined.\n* Feedback: Communication should be a two-way traffic. There should be some system by which the\nworkers should be able to convey their suggestions and grievances to the top management.\n19.13 BUILDING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION\nThe American Management Association has suggested the following ten commandments of good\ncommunication.\n* Clarifying an idea before communication\n* The purpose of communication\n* Understanding the physical and human environment of communication\n* Consulting others in planning communication\n* Contents and overtones of communication\n* Value of communication to the receiver\n* Follow-up action\n* Importance of communication\n* Action congruent with communication\n* Good listening\n19.14 COMMUNICATION NETWORKS\nCommunication network is a pattern of inter-connected lines. It is the system where the message\nmay flow in one direction or in several directions. As a pattern of contacts among the members of an\norganisation, communication network contains channels. If the netwrok is too long or round about\nthere will be delay in the flow of communication. If it is too narrow the message may get blocked.\nwhen the network contains several filtering points the message may get distorted. there are four\nmain communication networks as shown in the following figure. Circle\nChain Wheel Au channel\na Free flow\nFig. 19.6 Communication Networks\n(i) Circle Network: In case of circle network, the message moves in a circle, under it each person\ncan communicate with two others located on both of sides.\n(ii) Chain Network: Under this message flows in a direct verticle line along the scalar chain of\ncommand. All the subordinates receive order and instructions from one superior.\n(iii) Wheel Network: In this a number of subordinates report to one superior.It is called wheel because\nall communications pass through the centre person similar to the hub of a wheel.\n(iv) All channel Netowrk: It represents free flow of communication. Every member is allowed to\ncommunicate freely with all other members. It provides highest satisfaction.\n19.15 SUMMARY\nCommunication is an exchange of written or verbal information aiming at influencing the thinking,\nideas and behaviour of those with whom are is working as a team. For an effective communication\nfirst the messages are prepared, then they are send, after then they are received. The communications\nare to be channelised and codes should be prepared for better results. Efficiency and effectiveness\nof management depends upon effectiveness of communication. There is no management when\nthere is no proper communication.\n19.16 KEY WORDS\nCommunication: Simplest form of conveying of information from one person to another.\nHorizontal Communciation: Communication between people of equal status.\nFormal Communication: Communication passed through effectively recognised positions in the\norganisation chart.\nGrapevine Communication: It is an informal communication. It feels about a particular situation or\nthinks about the management.\nBarriers to Communication: Several causes for the ineffectiveness of communication. 19.17 SELF - ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1.

It is one of the two inseparable functions in\nmanagement being Planning and Controlling. These two functions are inseperable as planning\ndoesn\u2019t meet its purpose without controlling, while controlling can\u2019t achieve its goal without the\nassistance of planning and its components. So very significant managerial function is \u2018controlling\u2019\nthough it is the last one.\n* It is making a review\n* It is an investigation and audit\n* It is looking back once to checkup\n* It is making a comparison between two important aspects viz. actuals and standards, to find out\nwhether the actuals are at variance with standards (or) not.\n20.2 MEANING OF CONTROLLING\nThe executives instrument panel which guides progressive business to its target is managerial\ncontrol. The purpose of the control function is to examine the past and present activities so as to\nsearch out weaknesses which can be eliminated in the future and to ascertain the results. Centre for Distance Education 20.2 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nIn the words of Koontz and O\u2019Donnell \u201cControl is the measurement and correction of the\nperformance of subordinates in order to make sure that enterprise objectives and the plans devised\nto attain them are accomplished\u201d.\n20.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF CONTROLLING\nThe main characteristics of the controlling function are -\n(a) Controlling is a self corrective process: Controlling begins with planning. It can be exercised\nonly with reference to and on the basis of plans which establish the objectives. Actual performance\nis compared with the objectives established and deviations measured.\n(b) Controlling exercises at all levels: Controlling is exercised at all levels of management i.e.\ntop level, middle level and lower level.\n(c) Controlling is a continuous process: In the process of comparision of standards with\nactuals there will be a constant analysis of the validity of objectives, policies, procedures, positions,\nincentives and reports etc.\n(d) Controlling is forward looking: Another characteristic feature of controlling is that it always\nlooks forward. It relates to the future as a manager has no control on the happenings in the past.\nThey can only correct future action for further operations of work. Managers find it easy to reduce\nwastage, loss and deviation from standards in future from the knowledge which they have attained\nfrom previous experiences.\n(e) Controlling is a dynamic process: It is dynamic and flexible. It requires regular review and\ncheck up of standards and performances which leads to proper corrective action in plans according\nto the changing atmosphere, tests and needs of business.\n(f) Controlling is closely related to planing: Control makes impossible things possible which\nwould not otherwise happen. For this certain objectives are framed and are returned to as standards\nagainst which actual performance is checked.\nThus, although control is last function of the management, it is not least and enables again planning\nfunction.\nPlanning\nControlling\nOrganising\nDirecting\nStaffing Principles of Management 20.3 Controlling\n20.4 NATURE OF CONTROLLING\nnature of controlling function can be expanded in the following way.\n1. Planning is the basis of control:\nControl can be exercised only on the basis of plans. Effective control is possible only with the\nclear and effective planning of the organistion. Planning sets the course of action and control\nobserves deviations from the course of action.\n2. Action is the essence of control:\nControl is to correct a condition which is different from the one that is desired. To control, manager\nhas to initiate action which will guide the operations within the sphere of plans.\nFor instance \u2018Thermostat in a refrigerator works as the essence of control\u2019.\n3. Delegation is the key to control:\nControl is exercised by taking action and action may be taken within the authority delegated. An\nexecutive can performs the control function only if he enjoys the authority to take remedial action\nand is to be held accountable for results.\nExample:\nSuppose an executive is given the responsibility for maintaining the production level. he can really\nbe held accountable for this responsibility only if he has the authority to get the materials, equipment\nand take the action against reward the more efficient.\n4. Information is the guide to control:\nControl is exercised by a manager on the basis of the information and reports from those actually\ndoing the job. Such information and reports may be called the feed-back from the operations.\nFeed back enables the manager to determine how far the operations are proceeding in conformity\nwith plans and standards and where remedial action is called for accurate, adequate and timely\nfeed back information helps the management to take decisions in time. Too much information is\nas bad as too little.\n20.5 PROCESS OF CONTROLLING\nPlanning and controlling go together. These two are reciprocally related. Control seeks to compel\nevents to conform to plans. It is performed in the context of planning and aids planning in two\nways such as\n(a) it draws attention to sitautions where new planning is needed.\n(b) it provides some of the data upon which plans can be based.\nControlling is a step by step process. This process consists of the following steps.\n(1) Establishment of Control Standards: Every function in the organisation begins with plans\nwhich are goals, objectives, or targets to be achieved. In the light of these, standards are established Centre for Distance Education 20.4 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nwhich are criteria against which actual results are measured. For setting standards for control\npurposes, it is important to identify clearly and precisely the results which are desired. Standards\nmust be set and stated in tangible terms, such as in terms of output of goods, costs, profit, time,\nstaff etc. Standards can be set for many intangible items such as advertisement campaign,\nemployee morale etc.\n(2) Measurement of Performance: The second major step in control process is the\nmeasurement of performance. The step involves measuring the performance in respect of a\nwork in terms of control standards. The presence of standards implies a corresponding ability to\nobserve and comprehend the nature of existing conditions and to ascertain the degree of control\nbeing achieved.\nThe measurement of performance against standards should be on a future basis, so that deviations\nmay be detected in advance of their actual occurrence and avoided by appropriate actions. Appraisal\nof actual or expected performance becomes an easy task, if standards are properly determined.\nAccording to Peter F. Drucker, it is very much desirable to have clear and common measurements\nin all key areas of business. It is not necessary that measurements are rigidly quantitative. In his\nopinion, for measuring tangible and intangible performance, measurement must be -\na. clear, simple and rational\nb. relevant\nc. direct attention and efforts\nd. reliable, self announcing and understandable complicated interpretation or philosophical\ndiscussions.\n(3) Comparing actual and standard performance:\nThe third major step in control process is the comparison of actual and standard performance. It\ninvolves two steps -\ni. finding out the extent of deviations and\nii. identifying the causes of such deviations.\nWhen adequate standards are developed and actual performance is measured accurately,\nany variation will be clearly revealed. Management may have information relating to work\nperformance, data, charts, graphs and written reports, besides personal observation to keep\nitself informed about performance in different segments of the organisation. Such performance is\ncompared with the standard one to find out whether the various segements and individuals of the\norganisation are progressing in the right direction.\nWhen the standards are achieved, no further managerial action is necessary and control\nprocess is complete. However, standards may not be achieved in all cases and the extent of\nvariations may differ from case to case. Such variations depend upon the type of activity.\nWhen the deviation between standard and actual performacne is beyond the prescribed\nlimit, an analysis is made of the causes of such deviations. For controlling and planning purposes,\nascertaining the causes of variations along with computation of variations is important because\nsuch analysis helps management in taking up proper control action. The analysis will pinpoint the Principles of Management 20.5 Controlling\ncauses which are controllable by the person responsible. In such a case, person concerned will\ntake necessary corrective action. However, if the variation is caused by uncontrollable factors,\nthe person concerned cannot be held responsible and he cannot take any action.\n4. Correction of deviations: This is the last step in the control process which requires that\nactions should be taken to maintain the desired degree of control in the system or operation.\nSome actions are required to maintain the control.\nSuch control action may be -\ni) review of plans and goals and change therein on the basis of such review.\nii) change in the assignement of tasks\niii) change in existing techniques of direction\niv) change in organisation structure\nv) provision of new facilities etc.\nInf act, correction of deviation is the step in management control process which may involve\neither all or some of the managerial functions. Following this, decisions have to be taken for the\nfuture period.\nBriefly, the process is described best by the following figure.\nMeasurement of Comparison of\nStandards Taking remedial\nactual Actuals with\nEstablishment Action\nperformance performance\nFeed - Back\nFig. 20.1 : Controlling Process\n20.6 IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING\nThe main objective of control is to ensure a high degree of efficiency of the business. this very\nobjective helps the manager to attain the goals of the orgnaisation in a systematic and effective\nway. The following are the uses of controlling technique.\n1. Control helps to review operations and ensures high efficiency of the business.\n2. Control appraise results against performance, standards and policies.\n3. It helps to understand what had happened or is happening, why and by whom it happens.\n4. It helps to ensure effective and proper communication between the management and workers Centre for Distance Education 20.6 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nat all levels to achieve the objectives of the organisation.\n5. Control is essential to keep a proper check and control over direct and indirect expenses.\n6. Control helps to reframe organisational goals, policies and objectives.\n7. Control helps the management to find out the various deviations from the planned and proposed\ntargets and to take necessary corrective action.\n8. Control is essential to make sure that all the activities are performed according to the pre-\ndetermined plans.\n20.7 REQUISITES OF A GOOD CONTROLLING SYSTEM\n1. Suitability: The system should conform to the nature and needs of the activity or position\nsought to be controlled.\n2. Prompt Reporting: A good controlling system should be so devised as to report deviations\nfrom the plans and targets without loss of valuable time.\n3. Forward looking: A proper system of control should take into account the possibilities of the\nrecurrence of deviations from standards and should enable the manager concerned to think of\nand plan for future also.\n4. Focus on strategic points: A good control system is not only points out the deviations or\nexceptions but also pinpoints where they are important to this operations.\n5. Flexible: A sound control system should be flexible according to changes in plans.\n6. Objective: Control should be definite, determinable and verifiable.\n7. Reflection of organisation pattern: In enforcing control, the efficiency and the effectiveness\nof the organisation must be clearly brought out.\n8. Economical: A control system must be economical in the sense that the cost of its installation\nand maintenance should be justified by its benefits.\n9. Understandable: A control system should be easy to understand and follow by the managers.\n10.Suggestive of remedial action: An effective system should disclose where failures are\noccuring, who is responsible for them and what should be done about them.\n20.8 SUPERVISION\nSupervision is the function of keeping a watch on the working and performance of the workers. It\nis ultimate step of directing function. Literally it means the act of overseeing. (super : above or\nover, vision, sight, seeing) Supervisor supervises the subordinates at work to ensure maximum\nutilisation of resources, to get the required and directed work done and to correct the subordinates\nwhenever they go wrong. the major responsibility for supervision lies with the first line of\nmanagement. Following aspects makes the supervision effective.\n* Sound organisation setup\n* Effective Delegation\n* Human Approach\n* Effective Communication Principles of Management 20.7 Controlling\n* Management by Exception\nThe function of supervision has two broad aspects to it.\na. technical guidance and direction\nb. human relations and leadership\nSupervision is to be done at all levels of management. The top management supervises the work\nof middle management and the middle level management has to supervise the work of lower\nlevel management. The first line supervisors observe the work performance of the operating\npeople with whom they come into face to face contact.\nCharacteristics of Supervision: The main characteristics of a supervisor\u2019s job, i.e. supervision\nare:\n1. He is the executive head of some workers who actually perform i.e. operative workers.\n2. He works in close proximity of the actual performance.\n3. He plans operations for a very short period - a day or two or a week at the most.\n4. He instructs the workers at the actual work site.\n5. He operates in close proximity of the workers.\n6. He knows every individual worker\u2019s ability personally and can report on their performance.\n20.9 TYPES OF SUPERVISION\nSupervison is two types:\n(1) Direct supervision\n(2) Indirect supervision\nDirect Supervision: Direct supervision is the function of assuring that the work is being done in\naccordance with the plan and instruction. This involves intelligent watch and check of the work\nwhile it is in progress, to ensure that the instructions are understood properly and that the individual\nis really doing it as desired. It is the function of first line (bottom) management. Direct supervision\nhas the following merits.\n* Direct supervision boosts the morale of employees.\n* It increases their loyalty\n* It provides immediate feedback on the work of subordinates.\nIndirect Supervision: Managers at top level and middle level also watch work of bottom level\nwith sudden visits, periodically.Top level and middle level managers direct the organisation by\npassing rules, objectives programmes even to first line supervisors.\n20.10 MANAGEMENT BY EXCEPTION (MBE)\nThe principle of Management By Exception was first expressed as early as in 1919 by\nFrederick W. Taylor. Management by Exception means that \u201cevery body is given a target to be\nachieved and management need not supervise each and every thing\u201d. At higher levels of Centre for Distance Education 20.8 Acharya Nagarjuna University\nmanagement.Scientific Management consists in introducing this principle of management by\nexception. The main object of the principle is instead of overburdening the managers with all\nkinds of details about routine matters, only condensed reports must be sent to them. The routine\nmatter and details must be gone into by assistants and others at lower levels. this will give the\nmanagers ample opportunity to deal effectively with important policy matters which deserve\nthorough and complete consideration at their hands.\nObjectives of MBE:\n1. To make the management concentrate on significant and difficult things.\n2. Major deviations (standards - actuals) should be brought up for the managers attention.\n3. Non deviations from standards should not be brought to his notice.\n4. Fixation of targets of different individuals in the management.\n5. To enable management thorough consideration of objectives of management.\nBenefits of MBE:\n1. With the use of standard costing, the targets of different individuals are fixed.\n2. The attention of management is drawn only when actual performance is less than the budgeted\nperformance.\n3. No need of supervison of each and every thing.\n4. Every body tries to achieve his targets.\n5. Since things are going as per targets, management need not bother about each and every\nthing.\n6. Management can devote its time to other important things.\n20.11 KEY WORDS\nForward looking - Planning for future\n20.12 SELF ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS\n1. What is controlling? Discuss its nature.\n2.
