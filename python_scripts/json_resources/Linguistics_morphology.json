What is Learned (in this domain):\nWhat the words actually are.\nInnate bias for words\n\u2022 If it is true that words are not marked in the physical stream of speech, two questions: Morpheme: the minimal subpart of a word that expresses a meaning (or grammatical\nproperty)\n\u2022 Why did our brains in childhood (infancy) go to the trouble of working out\nhow to parse the speech stream into words? Example: dogs contains two morphemes:\ndogs = dog 'furry beast' + s 'plura\n\u2022 Why do our brains now go to the trouble of segmenting the speech stream\ndogs \u2260 d 'furry' + og 'beast' + s 'plural'\ninto words?\n\u2022 Why is the nature of the analysis so nearly identical across languages?\n2 How we learn words and morphemes\n\u2022 To question 1: One can give a functional explanation for the existence of words.\nRapidly!\n\u2022 It is advantageous to construct a flexible communication system out of a\nsmallish set of units, combined and recombined. \u2022 First words appear around age 1. (One-word stage.)\nKeeps memory use under control. Kids already know more than they say:\nAllows novel utterances. \u2022 In 11-month old, selective looking reveals preference for pauses that coincide\nwith word boundaries over pauses inserted between syllables of words.\n\u2022 But does this tell us how or why the baby acquires the words? Does she do \u2022 In 9-month old, no preference.\na little communication theory and decide that speech must contain words?\nProbably not. So what happened between 9 and 11?\nHow do you segment speech into words if you don't know the words?\n\u2022 Answer is an innate bias to perform some sort of analysis of speech No magic bullet, it seems! Part of the story must be a statistical analysis of input\n(explaining 1 and 2), and probably innate knowledge of what the product data carried out by the child \u2014 and there are explicit proposals about this.\nof this analysis will look like (explaining 3).\nBut a deeper question remains: Why does the baby perform this statistical analysis\nperformed, and why are the results saved in memory (ultimately, in the lexicon)?\nArbitrariness\n\u2022 But remember:\nAn approach to an answer:\nThe words themselves are not innately specified, or else they would not\nAn instinct for language acquistion.\ndiffer from speech community to speech community (arbitrariness).\nInnate knowledge coupled with environment-dependent learning.\n\u2022 Arbitratriness pervades language...\nEnglish dog, French chien, Russian sobaka...\n\u2022 ...even in \"onomatopoeia\" \u2014 how we represent animal sounds linguistically is fixed:1\n3 The knowledge underlying use of a complex word\ncow: Dutch boeh, Hungarian b\u00fa, Thai maw maw (with mid tone), Bengali hamba\ndog: Russian gav-gav, Catalan bup-bup, Indonesian gong-gong\n\u2022 Productivity of morphology:\n(1) industry, industrial, industrialize, industrialization., industrializational,\nindustrializationalize, industrializationalization, ...\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#Animal_sounds -2-\n\u2022 There is no termination to the process, except that the words become too long and their\nmeanings too complex to keep track of all the morphemes. Because the real poem truly is written in English (because its closed-class items are\nEnglish), the notion \"translating Jabberwocky\" into a foreign language is a meaningful\none, and lots of translations have been made.\n\u2022 An interesting difference between words and sentences: We have no problem parsing\nsentences with as many words as industrializationalization has morphemes (7 of\nthem!) -- compare even the process of turning a question about something else into a\nquestion about industrialization, which has the same meaning but 14 words! The\n\u2022 free vs. bound \u2260 open vs. closed class\nmulti-word phrase is much easier to understand than the multi-morpheme word. We\nare not as good at parsing words as we are at parsing sentences.\n\u2022 For example:\nThere are free closed-class morphemes (prepositions, pronouns, articles...)\nThere are bound open-class morphemes (un+kempt, sanit+ize)\n\u2022 Distinctions: bound morpheme vs. free morpheme / open-class vs. closed-class\nIndustry is a word on its own. free morpheme\n-ize, -al, and -ation are not. bound morpheme\n4 How to build a morphologically complex word: the rule Merge\n\u2022 The free morpheme industry belongs to an open class of lexical items, an extendible\nclass of items with a wide range of meanings. You can make up new ones, and are not You have to start somewhere!\nsurprised to learn new ones even in adulthood: screeve, Obama, cromulent.\nStep 0:\n\u2022 The opposite of \"open class\" is \"closed class\" (also known as \"function words\").\n\u2022 Take a morpheme from the lexicon whose lexical entry does not say \"I am a\nsuffix\" or \"I am a prefix\"... This starting point, which (as the textbook says)\nSince open class items can be coined at will (more or less), it is really the closed-class carries \"the main meaning of the sentence\", is the called root.\nitems that identify the language \u2014 that make English English, make French French etc.\nLewis Carroll's poem Jabberwocky contains lots of unfamiliar (\"nonsense\") open-class \u2022 Putting aside a special kind of complex word called a compound (to which\nitems, but all its closed-class items \u2014 all its function words \u2014 are English. Crazy though we return next week) \u2014 if there's a free morpheme in the word, it's the root.\nthe poem may sound, it is clearly a poem written in English!\nStep 1:\n\u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\n\u2022 A morphological rule that we can call \"Merge\" takes an appropriate\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nmorpheme from the lexicon and glues it to the root. (We return soon to\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\nwhat we mean by \"appropriate\".)\nCompare a version in which the open-class words are replaced with normal English, but \u2022 A non-root morpheme in a word is called an affix. So morphologically\ncomplex words are made up of a root and some number of affixes.\nthe function words are replaced with \"non-sense\". It no longer looks like English:\nGlorm cloudy, yurk lim noisy frogs\nRur croak yurk fidget uf lim lake;\nCaj nervous trid lim hunting dogs,\nYurk lim hungry cats lay awake.\nOr worse, replace both function words and open-class items with made-up words:\nGlorm brillig, yurk lim slithnit tovem\nRur gyre yurk gimble uf lim wabe;\nCaj mimsnit trid lim borogovem,\nYurk lim mome rathem nusgrabe. -3-\nThe lexical entry for each morpheme specifies \u2022 An argument against this: find a prefix that makes a noun (or adjective) into a verb!\n1. its sound The prefix en- (sometimes em-) forms verbs out of nouns (and adjectives):\n2. its meaning\n3. whether it is a root or affix body --> embody\n4. its part-of-speech (category): N, V, A... trance --> entrance\n5. if it is an affix, the part of speech it merges with: power --> empower\n6. if it is an affix, its place of attachment:\na. left edge (prefix) Now notice that these verbs can take the suffix -ment. Even though the morpheme next to\nb. right edge (suffix) -ment is not a verb morpheme, structurally -ment is being added to a verb.\n[c. after the first syllable, before the last syllable, before the main stress...\n(infix)]2\n6 \"Sound\" in more detail\nStep 2:\n\u2022 The output of step 2 can undergo Merge again. Another affix can be attached to it.\n\u2022 Whether a morpheme even has a sound is arbitrary.\n\u2022 The element to which an affix attaches (whether a root or a morphologically\ncomplex word) is called its base.\nIn English, the fact that a noun is singular is not represented by an overt morpheme\n\u2022 When an affix attaches to the root, the root is also its base. But when an affix (one can say there is a zero morpheme) \u2014 though plural is a morpheme with a sound\nattaches to a an already complex form, its base is not the root. of its own (dog vs. dog-s).\n\u2022 Some morphemes that do have a sound do not have a sound of their own. Their sound\n5 Trees\nis a copy of sounds already present in the base. This is called reduplication:\nExample 1: Lakhota (Siouan, S. Dakota)\n\u2022 A tree diagram can illustrate the internal structure of a word, and reflects how it was\nformed by one or more operations of Merge.\nsg inanimate pl\ng\u00ed gig\u00ed 'to be rusty brown'\n[see the textbook for lots of actual trees]\nsk\u00e1 skask\u00e1 'to be white'\n\u0283\u00e1 \u0283a\u0283\u00e1 'to be red'\n\u2022 Words really are trees (structures) -- not just strings of morphemes\nth\u00f3 thoth\u00f3 'to be blue or green'\n\u0292\u00ed \u0292i\u0292\u00ed 'to be yellow'\nFor example ...\nthe suffix -ment attaches to a verb and produces a noun:\nSound: Copy first CV of the base.\ngovern government\nExample 2: Ilocano (Austronesian, Phillippines)\nadjourn adjournment\nsg plural\ntreat treatment\np\u00ed\u014bgan pi\u014bp\u00ed\u014bgan 'dish'\namuse amusement\nt\u00e1lon talt\u00e1lon 'field'\nd\u00e1lon dald\u00e1lon 'road'\nbody \u2014X\u2192 *bodiment\nb\u00edag bib\u00edag 'lives'\ntrance \u2014X\u2192 *trancement\nnu\u00e1\u014b nunu\u00e1\u014b 'carabao'\npower \u2014X\u2192 *powerment\n\u00falo ul\u00falo 'head'\nm\u00fala mum\u00fala 'plant'\n\u2022 You might say: \"the morpheme next to -ment must be a verb\" as an alternative to \"the\nt\u00e1wa tawt\u00e1wa 'window'\nbase to which -ment attaches must be a verb\".\n2 Discussed below. -4-\nExample 3: Latin forms of the verb meaning 'love'\n\u2022 In the lexical entry for plural, under the heading \"sound\", it says not -ness, or un-, but:\npresent past future\n\"Copy first (C)V(C) of the base.\"\nyou (sg)... ama-s ama-ba-s ama-bi-s\n[C = consonant, V = vowel, parentheses = \"if present...\")\nshe/he/it... ama-t ama-ba-t ama-bi-t\n\u2022 Reduplication is extremely common in languages of the Austronesian group we... ama-mus ama-ba-mus ama-bi-mus\n(Phillipines, Malaysia, Indonesia)\nyou (pl.) ama-tis ama-ba-tis ama-bi-tis\nbut:\nI ... am-(a)-o ama-ba-m ama-b(i)-o\n7 Allomorphs\nthey ... ama-nt amaba-nt ama-bu-nt\n\u2022 Sometimes the sound of a morpheme depends on the base to which it is attached, but is The underlined bits are unexpected, and show allomorphs of the suffixes visible elsewhere\nnot a copy of that base. Such a morpheme will have different arbitrary (i.e. not in the chart.\ncopied) sounds depending on the base to which it attaches. These variants are called\nallomorphs.\n8 \"Place\" in more detail\nExample 1: English plural depends on the identity of the base to which it attaches.\ndog-s, cat-s, horse-s Point 1: The place of attachment must be listed in the lexicon, because it's arbitrary.\nbut...\nox-en \u2022 For example, whether a morpheme with a particular affix is a prefix or a suffix\nchild-ren varies across languages.\nsheep-\u00f8, deer-\u00f8\nExample 1: Russian vs. Bulgarian comparative and superlative affixes.\nNote that the -s plural is productive. It is the default plural marker which we\napply in the absence of special knowledge about an irregular plural marker. [I think I didn't do this one in class, but here it is anyway]\nWhat is the plural of wug? Bulgarian: sme\u0161na / po-sme\u0161na umna / po-umna\nRussian: sme\u0161na / sme\u0161n-ee umna / umn-ee3\nThe situation is more complicated still: the default affix is -z, which regular 'funny' / 'funnier' 'smart' / 'smarter'\nphonology changes to /s/ for reasons we will discuss later. But after -s, -z, -ch, -sh,\n-j we get a vowel as well. This is more allomorphy... Example 2: The affix meaning (roughly) -ness is a prefix in Kanuri, but a suffix (as in\nEnglish) in Kurdish. It's also worth noting that English -ness attaches only\nWhat is the plural of gruss? (mostly) to adjectives, while its Kurdish cousin also attaches to nouns\nSometimes the plural involves a change of vowel: mouse/mice, woman/women. Kanuri (Nilo-Saharan, Nigeria)\nExample 2: English past tense: gana 'small' n\u0259\u04d9mgana 'smallness'\nkura 'big' n\u0259\u04d9mkura 'bigness'\nDefault is -d, but here too we have vowel changes, and sometimes both: kurugu 'long' n\u0259\u04d9mkurugu 'length'\nkarite 'excellent' n\u0259\u04d9mkarite 'excellence'\nwalk/walked, industrialize/industrialized dibi 'bad' n\u0259\u04d9mdibi 'badness'\nrun/ran, sing/sang, lead/led, strive/strove\nsleep/slept\n3 Ignore for present purposes the -a of umna, which is a morpheme marking it as a\nfeminine adjective of a particular sort. -5-\nKurdish (Indo-Iranian, Iraq) (2) fuckin'-infixation\nInfix fuckin' to the left of the syllable that bears main stress.\naaqil 'wise' aaqilii 'forethought'\ndiz 'robber' dizii 'robbery' Thus:\ndrai\u0292 'long' drai\u0292ii 'length' (3) a. Massa-fuckin'-chusetts\nzaanaa 'wise' zaanaaii 'erudition' but not : b. *Massachu-fuckin's setts.\ngarm 'warm' garmii 'warmth'\n\u2014 because the syllable -chu- bears the main stress. Likewise:\nWe know: prefix (attach to left edge of base), suffix (attach to right edge of base)\n(4) a. Conn-fuckin'-ecticut\n[it helps to pause after the first syllable, or to draw it out]\n\u2022 Now: Infix! Attach inside the base, according to a rule that refers to the base's sound\nbut not: b. *Connect-fuckin'-icut.\nstructure.\nnor: c. *Connecti-fuckin'-cut.\nExample 1: Bontoc (Austronesian, Philippines)\n\u2022 This example shows that the rule does involve stress, and not counting syllables from\nThe infix -um- is positioned following the initial consonant of the base.\nthe end. since the stress in Connecticut falls on the third syllable from the end (the\n'he is becoming ...' antepenult), while the stress in Massachusetts falls on the next-to-last syllable (the\nfikas fumikas 'strong' penult), as we've seen.\nkilad kumilad 'red'\nbato bumato 'stone' (5) un-fuckin'-believable\nfusul fumusul 'enemy'\n\u2022 What is especially worth noting about the whole phenomenon is that it really is rule-\nExample 2: Samoan (Austronesian, Samoa) governed! We have clear intuitions about good vs. bad places to infix fuckin' within\nThis example is interesting because it is also reduplication: bases to which we have surely never heard this infixation rule applied.\n\"copy penultimate syllable and position it next to the original\"\n'he ...'
