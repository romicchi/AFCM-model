by jurvetsona cc by\na http://flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/397768296/\n1.1 Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should know the:\n\u2022 symbols used to represent atoms;\n\u2022 names of molecules commonly found in animal cells;\n\u2022 characteristics of ions and electrolytes;\n\u2022 basic structure of carbohydrates with examples;\n\u2022 carbohydrates can be divided into mono- di- and poly-saccharides;\n\u2022 basic structure of fats or lipids with examples;\n\u2022 basic structure of proteins with examples;\n\u2022 function of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins in the cell and animals\u2019 bodies;\n\u2022 foods which supply carbohydrates, lipids and proteins in animal diets.\n1.2 Elements And Atoms\nThe elements (simplest chemical substances) found in an animal\u2019s body are all made of\nbasic building blocks or atoms. The most common elements found in cells are given in the\ntable below with the symbol that is used to represent them.\nAtom Symbol\nCalcium Ca\nCarbon C\nChlorine Cl\nCopper Cu\nIodine I\nHydrogen H\nIron Fe\nMagnesium Mg\nNitrogen N\nOxygen O\nPhosphorous P\n3 Chemicals\nAtom Symbol\nPotassium K\nSodium Na\nSulfur S\nZinc Zn\n1.3 Compounds And Molecules\nA molecule is formed when two or more atoms join together. A compound is formed\nwhen two or than two different elements combine in a fixed ratio by mass. Note that some\natoms are never found alone. For example oxygen is always found as molecules of 2 oxygen\natoms (represented as O ).\n2\nThe table below gives some common compounds.\nCompound Symbol\nCalcium carbonate CaCO\n3\nCarbon dioxide CO\n2\nCopper sulfate CuSO\n4\nGlucose C H O\n6 12 6\nHydrochloric acid HCl\nSodium bicarbonate (baking soda) NaHCO\n3\nSodium chloride (table salt) NaCl\nSodium hydroxide NaOH\nWater H O\n2\n1.4 Chemical Reactions\nReactions occur when atoms combine or separate from other atoms. In the process new\nproducts with different chemical properties are formed.\nChemical reactions can be represented by chemical equations . The starting atoms or\ncompounds are usually put on the left-hand side of the equation and the products on the\nright-hand side.\nFor example\n\u2022 H O + CO gives H CO\n2 2 2 3\n\u2022 Water + Carbon dioxide gives Carbonic acid\n1.5 Ionization\nWhen some atoms dissolve in water they become charged particles called ions . Some\nbecome positively charged ions and others negatively charged. Ions may have one, two or\nsometimes three charges.\n4 Organic And Inorganic Compounds\nThe table below shows examples of positively and negatively charged ions with the number\nof their charges.\nPositive Ions Negative Ions\nH+ Hydrogen Cl- Chloride\nCa2+ Calcium OH- Hydroxyl\nNa+ Sodium HCO - Bicarbonate\n3\nK+ Potassium CO 2- Carbonate\n3\nMg2+ Magnesium SO 2- Sulfate\n4\nFe2+ Iron (ferrous) PO 3- Phosphate\n4\nFe3+ Iron (ferric) S2- Sulfide\nPositive and negative ions attract one another to hold compounds together.\nIons are important in cells because they conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Sub-\nstances that ionise in this way are known as electrolytes .\nThe molecules in an animal\u2019s body fall into two groups: inorganic compounds and\norganic compounds . The difference between these is that the first type does not contain\ncarbon and the second type does.\n1.6 Organic And Inorganic Compounds\nInorganic compounds include water, sodium chloride, potassium hydroxide and calcium\nphosphate.\nWater is the most abundant inorganic compound, making up over 60% of the volume of\ncells and over 90% of body fluids like blood. Many substances dissolve in water and all\nthe chemical reactions that take place in the body do so when dissolved in water. Other\ninorganic molecules help keep the acid/base balance ( pH ) and concentration of the\nblood and other body fluids stable (see Chapter 8).\nOrganic compounds include carbohydrates, proteins and fats . All organic molecules\ncontaincarbonatomsandtheytendtobelargerandmorecomplexmoleculesthaninorganic\nones. This is largely because each carbon atom can link with four other atoms. Organic\ncompounds can therefore consist of from one to many thousands of carbon atoms joined to\nform chains, branched chains and rings (see diagram below). All organic compounds also\ncontain hydrogen and they may also contain other elements.\nFigure 2\n1.7 Carbohydrates\nThename\u201ccarbohydrate\u201dtellsyousomethingaboutthecompositionofthese\u201chydratedcar-\nbon\u201d compounds. They contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and like water (H O), there\n2\n5 Chemicals\nare always twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms in each molecule. Carbohy-\ndrates are a large and diverse group that includes sugars, starches, glycogen and cellulose.\nCarbohydrates in the diet supply an animal with much of its energy and in the animal\u2019s\nbody, they transport and store energy.\nCarbohydratesaredividedintothreemajorgroupsbasedonsize: monosaccharides(single\nsugars), disaccharides (double sugars) and polysaccharides (multi sugars).\nMonosaccharidesarethesmallestcarbohydratemolecules. Themostimportantmonosac-\ncharide is glucose which supplies much of the energy in the cell. It consists of a ring of 6\ncarbon atoms with oxygen and hydrogen atoms attached.\nDisaccharides are formed when 2 monosaccharides join together. Sucrose (table sugar),\nmaltose, andlactose(milksugar), arethreeimportantdisaccharides. Theyarebrokendown\nto monosaccharides by digestive enzymes in the gut.\nPolysaccharides like starch, glycogen and cellulose are formed by tens or hundreds of\nmonosaccharides linking together. Unlike mono- and di-saccharides, polysaccharides are\nnot sweet to taste and most do not dissolve in water.\nUNKNOWN TEMPLATE multiple image\ncenterGlucoseLactoseGlucoseDisaccharide(Lactose)Alpha-D-Glucopyranose.svgLactose\nHaworth.svg 164 202\n\u2022 Starch is the main molecule in which plants store the energy gained from the sun. It is\nfound in grains like barley and roots like potatoes.\n\u2022 Glycogen , the polysaccharide used by animals to store energy, is found in the liver\nand the muscles that move the skeleton.\n\u2022 Cellulose forms the rigid cell walls of plants. Its structure is similar to glycogen, but\nit can\u2019t be digested by mammals. Cows and horses can eat cellulose with the help of\nbacteria which live in specialised parts of their gut.\nFigure 3\n6 Fats\n1.8 Fats\nFats or lipids are important in the plasma membrane around cells and form the insulating\nfat layer under the skin. They are also a highly concentrated source of energy, and when\neaten in the diet provide more than twice as much energy per gram as either carbohydrates\nor proteins.\nLike carbohydrates fats contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but unlike them, there is no\nparticular relationship between the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\nThe fats and oils animals eat in their diets are called triglycerides orneutral fats .\nThe building blocks of triglycerides are 3 fatty acids attached to a backbone of glycerol\n(glycerine ). When fats are eaten the digestive enzymes break down the molecules into\nseparate fatty acids and glycerol again.\nFatty acids are divided into two kinds: saturated and unsaturated fatty acids de-\npending on how much hydrogen they contain. The fat found in animals bodies and in dairy\nproducts contains mainly saturated fatty acids and tends to be solid at room temperature.\nFish and poultry fats and plant oils contain mostly unsaturated fatty acids and are more\nliquid at room temperature.\nPhospholipids are lipids that contain a phosphate group. They are important in the\nplasma membrane of the cell.\n7 Chemicals\nFigure 4\nFigure 5\n1.9 Proteins\nProteins are the third main group of organic compounds in the cell - in fact if you dried\nout a cell you would find that about 2/3 of the dry dust you were left with would consist of\nprotein. Like carbohydrates and fats, proteins contain C, H and O but they all also contain\nnitrogen . Many also contain sulphur and phosphorus.\nIn the cell, proteins are an important part of the plasma membrane of the cell, but their\nmost essential role is as enzymes . These are molecules that act as biological catalysts and\n8 Proteins\nare necessary for biochemical reactions to proceed. Protein is also found as keratin in the\nskin, feathers and hair, in muscles, as well as in antibodies and some hormones.\nProteins are built up of long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids . There are\n20 common types of amino acid and different numbers of these arranged in different orders\ncreate the multitude of individual proteins that exist in an animal\u2019s body.\nLongchainsofaminoacidsoftenlinkwithotheraminoacidchainsandtheresultingprotein\nmolecule may twist, spiral and fold up to make a complex 3-dimensional shape. As an\nexample, see the diagram of the protein lysozyme below. Believe it or not, this is a small\nand relatively simple protein.\nFigure 6\n9 Chemicals\nIt is this shape that determines how proteins behave in cells, particularly when they are\nacting as enzymes. If for any reason this shape is altered, the protein stops working. This\nis what happens if proteins are heated or put in a solution that is too acidic or alkaline.\nThink what happens to the \u201cwhite\u2019\u201d of an egg when it is cooked. The \u201cwhite\u201d contains\nthe protein albumin, which is changed or \u201cdenatured \u201d permanently by cooking. The\ncatastrophic effect that heat has on enzymes is one of the reasons animals die if exposed to\nhigh temperatures.\nIn the animal\u2019s diet, proteins are found in meat (muscle), dairy products, seeds, nuts and\nlegumes like soya. When the enzymes in the gut digest proteins they break them down into\nthe separate amino acids, which are small enough to be absorbed into the blood.\n1.10 Summary\n\u2022 Ions are charged particles, and electrolytes are solutions of ions in water.\n\u2022 Carbohydrates are made of carbon with hydrogen and oxygen (in the same ratio as\nwater) linked together. The cell mainly uses carbohydrates for energy.\n\u2022 Fats are also made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are a powerful energy source,\nand are also used for insulation.\n\u2022 Proteins are the building materials of the body, and as enzymes make cell reactions\nhappen. They contain nitrogen as well as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.\n1.11 Worksheet\nWorksheet on Chemicals in the Cell1\n1.12 Test Yourself\n1. What is the difference between an atom and a molecule?\n2.

It does this by describing, naming and\nplacing them in different groups. As veterinary nurses you are mainly concerned with\nthe Animal Kingdom but don\u2019t forget that animals rely on the Plant Kingdom for food\nto survive. Also many diseases that animals are affected by are members of the other\nKingdoms -- fungi, bacteria and single celled animals.\n2.2 Naming And Classifying Animals\nThere are more than 1.5 million different kinds of living organism on Earth ranging from\nsmall and simple bacteria to large, complex mammals. From the earliest time that humans\nhave studied the natural world they have named these living organisms and placed them in\ndifferent groups on the basis of their similarities and differences.\n2.3 Naming Animals\nOf course we know what a cat, a dog and a whale are but, in some situations using the\ncommon names for animals can be confusing. Problems arise because people in different\ncountries, and even sometimes in the same country, have different common names for the\nsame animals. For example a cat can be a chat, a Katze, gato, katt, or a moggie, depending\non which language you use. To add to the confusion sometimes the same name is used\nfor different animals. For example, the name \u2018gopher\u2019 is used for ground squirrels, rodents\n(pocket gophers), for moles and in the south-eastern United States for a turtle. This is\nthe reason why all animals have been given an official scientific or binomial name .\nUnfortunately these names are always in Latin. For example:\n\u2022 Common rat: Rattus rattus\n\u2022 Human: Homo sapiens\n\u2022 Domestic cat: Felis domesticus\n\u2022 Domestic dog: Canis familiaris\nAs you can see from the above there are certain rules about writing scientific names:\n\u2022 They always have 2 parts to them.\n\u2022 The first part is the genus name and is always written with a capital first letter.\n\u2022 The second name is the species name and is always written in lower case .\n\u2022 The name is always underlined or printed in italics .\n14 Classification Of Living Organisms\nThe first time you refer to an organism you should write the whole name in full. If you need\nto keep referring to the same organism you can then abbreviate the genus name to just the\ninitial. Thus \u201cCanis familiaris \u201d becomes \u201cC. familiaris \u201d the second and subsequent times\nyou refer to it.\n2.4 Classification Of Living Organisms\nTo make some sense of the multitude of living organisms they have been placed in different\ngroups. The method that has been agreed by biologists for doing this is called the classi-\nfication system . The system is based on the assumption that the process of evolution\nhas, over the millennia, brought about slow changes that have converted simple one-celled\norganisms to complex multi-celled ones and generated the earth\u2019s incredible diversity of life\nforms. The classification system attempts to reflect the evolutionary relationships between\norganisms.\nInitially this classification was based only on the appearance of the organism. However, the\ndevelopmentofnewtechniqueshasadvancedourscientificknowledge. Thelightmicroscope\nand later the electron microscope have enabled us to view the smallest structures, and now\ntechniques for comparing DNA have begun to clarify still further the relationships between\norganisms. In the light of the advances in knowledge the classification has undergone\nnumerous revisions over time.\nAt present most biologists divide the living world into 5 kingdoms, namely:\n\u2022 bacteria\n\u2022 protists\n\u2022 fungi\n\u2022 plants\n\u2022 animal\nWe are concerned here almost entirely with the Animal Kingdom . However, we must\nnot forget that bacteria, protists, and fungi cause many of the serious diseases that af-\nfect animals, and all animals rely either directly or indirectly on the plant world for their\nnourishment.\n2.5 The Animal Kingdom\nSo what are animals? If we were suddenly confronted with an animal we had never seen in\nour lives before, how would we know it was not a plant or even a fungus? We all intuitively\nknow part of the answer to this.\nAnimals:\n\u2022 eat organic material (plants or other animals)\n\u2022 move to find food\n\u2022 take the food into their bodies and then digest it\n\u2022 and most reproduce by fertilizing eggs by sperm\n15 Classification\nIf you were tempted to add that animals are furry, run around on four legs and give birth to\nyoungthattheyfeedonmilkyouwerethinkingonlyofmammalsandforgettingtemporarily\nthat frogs, snakes and crocodiles, birds as well as fish, are also animals.\nThese are all members of the group called the vertebrates (or animals with a backbone)\nand mammals make up only about 8% of this group. The diagram on the next page shows\nthe percentage of the different kinds of vertebrates.\nFigure 8\nHowever, the term animal includes much more than just the Vertebrates. In fact this group\nmakes up only a very small portion of all animals. Take a look at the diagram below, which\nshowsthesizeofthedifferentgroupsofanimalsintheAnimalKingdomasproportionsofthe\ntotal number of different animal species. Notice the small size of the segment representing\n16 The Classification Of Vertebrates\nvertebrates! All the other animals in the Animal Kingdom are animals with no backbone,\nor invertebrates . This includes the worms, sea anemones, starfish, snails, crabs, spiders\nand insects. As more than 90% of the invertebrates are insects, no wonder people worry\nthat insects may take over the world one day!\nFigure 9\n2.6 The Classification Of Vertebrates\nAs we have seen above the Vertebrates are divided into 5 groups or classes namely:\n\u2022 Fish\n\u2022 Amphibia (frogs and toads)\n\u2022 Reptiles (snakes and crocodiles)\n\u2022 Birds\n\u2022 Mammals\nTheseclassesareallbasedonsimilarities. Forinstanceallmammalshaveasimilarskeleton,\nhair on their bodies, are warm bodied and suckle their young.\nThe class Mammalia (the mammals) contains 3 subclasses :\n\u2022 Duck billed platypus and the spiny anteater\n\u2022 Marsupials (animals like the kangaroo with pouches)\n\u2022 True mammals (with a placenta)\nWithin the subclass containing the true mammals, there are groupings called orders that\ncontain mammals that are more closely similar or related, than others. Examples of six\nmammalian orders are given below:\n\u2022 Rodents (Rodentia) (rats and mice)\n\u2022 Carnivores (Carnivora) (cats, dogs, bears and seals)\n\u2022 Even-toed grazers (Artiodactyla) (pigs, sheep, cattle, antelopes)\n\u2022 Odd-toed grazers (Perissodactyla) (horses, donkeys, zebras)\n\u2022 Marine mammals (Cetacea) (whales, sea cows)\n\u2022 Primates (monkeys, apes, humans)\n17 Classification\nWithin each order there are various families . For example within the carnivore mammals\nare the families:\n\u2022 Canidae (dog-like carnivores)\n\u2022 Felidae (cat-like carnivores)\nEven at this point it is possible to find groupings that are more closely related than others.\nThese groups are called genera (singular genus). For instance within the cat family Felidae\nis the genus Felis containing the cats, as well as genera containing panthers, lynxes, and\nsabre toothed tigers!\nThe final groups within the system are the species . The definition of a species is a group\nof animals that can mate successfully and produce fertile offspring . This means\nthat all domestic cats belong to the species Felis domesticus , because all breeds of cat\nwhether Siamese, Manx or ordinary House hold cat can cross breed. However, domestic\ncats can not mate successfully with lions, tigers or jaguars, so these are placed in separate\nspecies, e.g. Felis leo, Felis tigris and Felis onca .\nEvenwithinthesamespecies,therecanbeanimalswithquitewidevariationsinappearance\nthat still breed successfully. We call these different breeds, races or varieties . For\nexample there are many different breeds of dogs from Dalmatian to Chihuahua and of\ncats, from Siamese to Manx and domestic short-hairs, but all can cross breed. Often these\nbreeds have been produced byselective breeding but varieties can arise in the wild when\ngroups of animals are separated by a mountain range or sea and have developed different\ncharacteristics over long periods of time.\nTo summarise, the classification system consists of:\nThe A nimal K ingdom which is divided into\nP hyla which are divided into\nC lasses which are divided into\nO rders which are divided into\nF amilies which are divided into\nG enera which are divided into\nS pecies.\n\u201cKings Play Cricket On Flat Green Surfaces \u201d OR \u201cKindly Professors Cannot\nOften Fail Good Students\u201darejusttwoofthephrasesstudentsusetoremindthemselves\nof the order of these categories - on the other hand you might like to invent your own.\n2.7 Summary\n\u2022 The scientific name of an animal has two parts, the genus and the species , and must\nbe written in italics or underlined .\n\u2022 Animals are divided into vertebrates and invertebrates .\n\u2022 The classification system has groupings called phyla , classes , orders , families ,\ngenera and species .\n18 Worksheet\n\u2022 Furry, milk-producing animals are all in the class Mammalia.\n\u2022 Members within a species can mate and produce fertile offspring.\n\u2022 Sub-groups within a species include breeds, races and varieties .\n2.8 Worksheet\nWorkthroughtheexercisesinthis ClassificationWorksheet1 tohelpyoulearnhowtowrite\nscientific names and classify different animals.\n2.9 Test Yourself\n1a) True or False.

Bacteria and the parasite that\ncauses malaria consist of single cells, while plants and animals are made up of trillions of\ncells. Most cells are spherical or cube shaped but some are a range of different shapes (see\ndiagram 3.1).\n22 The Cell\nMost cells are so small that a microscope is needed to see them, although a few cells, e.g.\nthe ostrich\u2019s egg, are so large that they could make a meal for several people.\nA normal cell is about 0.02 of a millimetre (0.02mm) in diameter. (Small distances like this\nare normally expressed in micrometres or microns (\u03bcm). Note there are 1000 \u03bcms in every\nmm).\nFigure 12 Diagram 3.2 : An animal cell\nWhen you look at a typical animal cell with a light microscope it seems quite simple with\nonly a few structures visible (see diagram 3.2).\nThree main parts can be seen:\n\u2022 an outer cell membrane (plasma membrane),\n\u2022 an inner region called the cytoplasm and\n\u2022 the nucleus\n23 The Cell\nFigure 13 Diagram 3.3 : An animal cell as seen with an electron microscope\nHowever, when you use an electron microscope to increase the magnification many thou-\nsands of times you see that these seemingly simple structures are incredibly complex, each\nwith its own specialized function. For example the plasma membrane is seen to be a dou-\nble layer and the cytoplasm contains many special structures called organelles (meaning\nlittle organs) which are described below. A drawing of the cell as seen with an electron\nmicroscope is shown in diagram 3.3.\n24 The Plasma Membrane\n3.3 The Plasma Membrane\nFigure 14 Diagram 3.4 : The structure of the plasma membrane\nThethinplasmamembranesurroundsthecell,separatingitscontentsfromthesurroundings\nand controlling what enters and leaves the cell. The plasma membrane is composed of\ntwo main molecules,phospholipids(fats) and proteins. The phospholipids are arranged in a\ndouble layer with the large protein molecules dotted about in the membrane (see diagram\n3.4). Some of the protein molecules form tiny channels in the membrane while others help\ntransport substances from one side of the membrane to the other.\n3.3.1 How substances move across the Plasma Membrane\nSubstances need to pass through the membrane to enter or leave the cell and they do so in\na number of ways. Some of these processes require no energy i.e. they are passive, while\nothers require energy i.e. they are active .\nPassive processes include: a) diffusion and b) osmosis, while active processes include: c)\nactive transport, d) phagocytosis, e) pinocytosis and f) exocytosis. These will be described\nbelow.\n25 The Cell\nFigure 15 Diagram 3.5 : Diffusion in a liquid\na) Diffusion\nAlthough you may not know it, you are already familiar with the process of diffusion. It is\ndiffusion that causes a smell (expensive perfume or smelly socks) in one part of the room\nto gradually move through the room so it can be smelt on the other side. Diffusion occurs\nin the air and in liquids.\nDiagram 3.5 shows what happens when a few crystals of a dark purple dye called potassium\npermanganate are dropped into a beaker of water. The dye molecules diffuse into the water\nmoving from high to low concentrations so they become evenly distributed throughout the\nbeaker.\nIn the body, diffusion causes molecules that are in a high concentration on one side of the\ncell membrane to move across the membrane until they are present in equal concentrations\non both sides. It takes place because all molecules have an in-built vibration that causes\nthem to move and collide until they are evenly distributed. It is an absolutely natural\nprocess that requires no added energy.\nSmall molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and ammonia as well as fats, diffuse\ndirectly through the double fat layer of the membrane. The small molecules named above\naswellasavarietyofchargedparticles(ions)alsodiffusethroughtheprotein-linedchannels.\nLarger molecules like glucose attach to a carrier molecule that aids their diffusion through\nthe membrane. This is called facilitated diffusion .\n26 The Plasma Membrane\nIn the animal\u2019s body diffusion is important for moving oxygen and carbon dioxide between\nthe lungs and the blood, for moving digested food molecules from the gut into the blood\nand for the removal of waste products from the cell.\nFigure 16 Diagram 3.6 : Osmosis\nb) Osmosis\nAlthough the word may be unfamiliar, you are almost certainly acquainted with the effects\nof osmosis. It is osmosis that plumps out dried fruit when you soak it before making a\nfruit cake or makes that wizened old carrot look almost like new when you soak it in water.\nOsmosis is in fact the diffusion of water across a membrane that allows water across but\nnot larger molecules. This kind of membrane is called a semi-permeable membrane .\nTake a look at side A of diagram 3.6. It shows a container divided into two parts by\nan artificial semi-permeable membrane. Water is poured into one part while a solution\ncontaining salt is poured into the other part. Water can cross the membrane but the salt\ncannot. Thewatercrossesthesemi-permeablemembranebydiffusionuntilthereisanequal\namount of water on both sides of the membrane. The effect of this would be to make the\nsalt solution more diluted and cause the level of the liquid in the right-hand side of the\ncontainer to rise so it looked like side B of diagram 3.6. This movement of water across the\nsemi-permeablemembraneiscalledosmosis. Itisacompletelynaturalprocessthatrequires\nno outside energy.\nAlthough it would be difficult to do in practice, imagine that you could now take a plunger\nand push down on the fluid in the right-hand side of container B so that it flowed back\nacross the semi-permeable membrane until the level of fluid on both sides was equal again.\nIf you could measure the pressure required to do this, this would be equal to the osmotic\n27 The Cell\npressure of the salt solution. (This is a rather advanced concept at this stage but you will\nmeet this term again when you study fluid balance later in the course).\nFigure 17 Diagram 3.7 : Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypotonic solution\nThe plasma membrane of cells acts as a semi-permeable membrane. If red blood cells, for\nexample, are placed in water, the water crosses the membrane to make the amount of water\non both sides of it equal (see diagram 3.7). This means that the water moves into the cell\ncausing it to swell. This can occur to such an extent that the cell actually bursts to release\nits contents. This bursting of red blood cells is called haemolysis . In a situation such as\nthis when the solution on one side of a semi-permeable membrane has a lower concentration\nthan that on the other side, the first solution is said to be hypotonic to the second.\nFigure 18 Diagram 3.8 : Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypertonic solution\nNow think what would happen if red blood cells were placed in a salt solution that has\na higher salt concentration than the solution within the cells (see diagram 3.8). Such a\nbathing solution is called a hypertonic solution. In this situation the \u201cconcentration\u201d of\nwater within the cells would be higher than that outside the cells. Osmosis (diffusion of\nwater) would then occur from the inside of the cells to the outside solution, causing the\ncells to shrink.\n28 The Plasma Membrane\nFigure 19 Diagram 3.9 : Red cells placed in an isotonic solution\nAsolutionthatcontains0.9%salthasthesameconcentrationasbodyfluidsandthesolution\nwithin red cells. Cells placed in such a solution would neither swell nor shrink (see diagram\n3.9). This solution is called an isotonic solution. This strength of salt solution is often\ncalled normal saline and is used when replacing an animal\u2019s body fluids or when cells like\nred blood cells have to be suspended in fluid.\nRemember - osmosis is a special kind of diffusion. It is the diffusion of water molecules\nacross a semi-permeable membrane. It is a completely passive process and requires no\nenergy.\nSometimes it is difficult to remember which way the water molecules move. Although it\nis not strictly true in a biological sense, many students use the phrase \u201cSALT SUCKS\u201d\nto help them remember which way water moves across the membrane when there are two\nsolutions of different salt concentrations on either side.\nAs we have seen water moves in and out of the cell by osmosis. All water movement from\nthe intestine into the blood system and between the blood capillaries and the fluid around\nthe cells (tissue or extra cellular fluid) takes place by osmosis. Osmosis is also important in\nthe production of concentrated urine by the kidney.\nc) Active transport\n29 The Cell\nWhenasubstanceistransportedfromalowconcentrationtoahighconcentrationi.e. uphill\nagainst the concentration gradient, energy has to be used. This is called active transport\n.\nActive transport is important in maintaining different concentrations of the ions sodium\nand potassium on either side of the nerve cell membrane. It is also important for removing\nvaluable molecules such as glucose, amino acids and sodium ions from the urine.\nFigure 20 Diagram 3.10 : Phagocytosis\nd) Phagocytosis\nPhagocytosis is sometimes called \u201ccell eating\u201d. It is a process that requires energy and is\nused by cells to move solid particles like bacteria across the plasma membrane. Finger-like\nprojections from the plasma membrane surround the bacteria and engulf them as shown\nin diagram 3.10. Once within the cell, enzymes produced by the lysosomes of the cell\n(described later) destroy the bacteria.\nThe destruction of bacteria and other foreign substance by white blood cells by the process\nof phagocytosis is a vital part of the defense mechanisms of the body.\ne) Pinocytosis\nPinocytosis or \u201ccell drinking\u201d is a very similar process to phagocytosis but is used by cells\nto move fluids across the plasma membrane. Most cells carry out pinocytosis (note the\npinocytotic vesicle in diagram 3.3).\nf) Exocytosis\n30 The Cytoplasm\nExocytosisistheprocessbymeansofwhichsubstancesformedinthecellaremovedthrough\nthe plasma membrane into the fluid outside the cell (or extra-cellular fluid). It occurs in\nall cells but is most important in secretory cells (e.g. cells that produce digestive enzymes)\nand nerve cells.\n3.4 The Cytoplasm\nWithin the plasma membrane is the cytoplasm . It consists of a clear jelly-like fluid called\nthe a) cytosol or intracellular fluid in which b) cell inclusions , c) organelles and d)\nmicrofilaments and microtubules are found.\n3.4.1 a) Cytosol\nThe cytosol consists mainly of water in which various molecules are dissolved or suspended.\nThese molecules include proteins, fats and carbohydrates as well as sodium, potassium,\ncalcium and chloride ions. Many of the reactions that take place in the cell occur in the\ncytosol.\n3.4.2 b) Cell inclusions\nThese are large particles of fat, glycogen and melanin that have been produced by the cell.\nThey are often large enough to be seen with the light microscope. For example the cells of\nadipose tissue (as in the insulating fat layer under the skin) contain fat that takes up most\nof the cell.\n3.4.3 c) Organelles\nOrganelles arethe\u201clittle organs\u201dofthe cell- liketheheart, kidney andliverare theorgans\nof the body. They are structures with characteristic appearances and specific \u201cjobs\u201d in the\ncell. Most can not be seen with the light microscope and so it was only when the electron\nmicroscopewasdevelopedthattheywerediscovered. Themainorganellesinthecellarethe\nribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, Golgi complexandlysosomes\n. Acellcontainingtheseorganellesasseenwiththeelectronmicroscopeisshownindiagram\n3.3.\nRibosomes\nFigure 21 Diagram 3.11 : Rough endoplasmic reticulum\nRibosomes are tiny spherical organelles that make proteins by joining amino acids to-\ngether. Many ribosomes are found free in the cytosol, while others are attached to the\nrough endoplasmic reticulum.\n31 The Cell\nEndoplasmic reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes that form channels\nthroughout the cytoplasm from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. Various molecules\nare made in the ER and transported around the cell in its channels. There are two types\nof ER: smooth ER and rough ER.\nSmooth ER is where the fats in the cell are made and in some cells, where chemicals\nlike alcohol, pesticides and carcinogenic molecules are inactivated.\nThe Rough ER has ribosomes attached to its surface. The function of the Rough ER is\ntherefore to make proteins that are modified stored and transported by the ER (Diagram\n3.11).\nMitochondria\nFigure 22 Diagram 3.12 : A mitochondrion\nMitochondria (singular mitochondrion) are oval or rod shaped organelles scattered\nthroughout the cytoplasm. They consist of two membranes, the inner one of which is\nfolded to increase its surface area. (Diagram 3.12)\nMitochondria are the \u201cpower stations\u201d of the cell. They make energy by \u201cburning\u201d food\nmolecules like glucose. This process is called cellular respiration . The reaction requires\noxygen and produces carbon dioxide which is a waste product. The process is very com-\nplex and takes place in a large number of steps but the overall word equation for cellular\nrespiration is-\nGlucose + oxygen = carbon dioxide + water + energy\nNote that cellular respiration is different from respiration or breathing. Breathing is the\nmeans by which air is drawn into and expelled from the lungs. Breathing is necessary to\nsupply the cells with the oxygen required by the mitochondria and to remove the carbon\ndioxide produced as a waste product of cellular respiration.\nActive cells like muscle, liver, kidney and sperm cells have large numbers of mitochondria.\nGolgi Apparatus\nFigure 23 Diagram 3.13 : A Golgi body\n32 The Nucleus\nThe Golgi bodies in a cell together make up the Golgi apparatus . Golgi bodies are\nfound near the nucleus and consist of flattened membranes stacked on top of each other\nrather like a pile of plates (see diagram 3.13). The Golgi apparatus modifies and sorts the\nproteins and fats made by the ER, then surrounds them in a membrane as vesicles so they\ncan be moved to other parts of the cell.\nLysosomes\nLysosomes are large vesicles that contain digestive enzymes. These break down bacteria\nand other substances that are brought into the cell by phagocytosis or pinocytosis. They\nalso digest worn-out or damaged organelles, the components of which can then be recycled\nby the cell to make new structures.\n3.4.4 d) Microfilaments And Microtubules\nSome cells can move and change shape and organelles and chemicals are moved around the\ncell. Threadlike structures called microfilaments and microtubules that can contract\nare responsible for this movement.\nThese structures also form the projections from the plasma membrane known as flagella\n(singular flagellum) as in the sperm tail, and cilia found lining the respiratory tract and\nused to remove mucus that has trapped dust particles (see chapter 4).\nMicrotubules also form the pair of cylindrical structures called centrioles found near the\nnucleus. These help organise the spindle used in cell division.\n3.5 The Nucleus\nFigure 24 Diagram 3.14 : A cell with an enlarged chromosome\n33 The Cell\nFigure 25 Diagram 3.15 : A full set of human chromosomes\nThe nucleus is the largest structure in a cell and can be seen with the light microscope.\nIt is a spherical or oval body that contains the chromosomes . The nucleus controls the\ndevelopment and activity of the cell. Most cells contain a nucleus although mature red\nblood cells have lost theirs during development and some muscle cells have several nuclei.\nA double membrane similar in structure to the plasma membrane surrounds the nucleus\n(now called the nuclear envelope). Pores in this nuclear membrane allow communication\nbetween the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\nWithin the nucleus one or more spherical bodies of darker material can be seen, even with\nthelightmicroscope. ThesearecallednucleoliandaremadeofRNA.Theirroleistomake\nnew ribosomes.\n34 Cell Division\n3.5.1 Chromosomes\nInside the nucleus are the chromosomes which:\n\u2022 contain DNA;\n\u2022 control the activity of the cell;\n\u2022 are transmitted from cell to cell when cells divide;\n\u2022 are passed to a new individual when sex cells fuse together in sexual reproduction.\nIn cells that are not dividing the chromosomes are very long and thin and appear as dark\ngrainy material. They become visible just before a cell divides when they shorten and\nthicken and can then be counted (see diagram 3.14).\nThe number of chromosomes in the cells of different species varies but is constant in the\ncells of any one species (e.g. horses have 64 chromosomes, cats have 38 and humans 46).\nChromosomes occur in pairs (i.e. 32 pairs in the horse nucleus and 19 in that of the cat).\nMembers of each pair are identical in length and shape and if you look carefully at diagram\n3.15, you may be able to see some of the pairs in the human set of chromosomes.\n3.6 Cell Division\nFigure 26 Diagram 3.16 : Division by mitosis results in 2 new cells identical to each\nother and to parent cell\n35 The Cell\nFigure 27 Diagram 3.17 : Division by meiosis results in 4 new cells that are\ngenetically different to each other\nCells divide when an animal grows, when its body repairs an injury and when it produces\nsperm and eggs (or ova). There are two types of cell division: Mitosis and meiosis .\nMitosis . This is the cell division that occurs when an animal grows and when tissues\nare repaired or replaced. It produces two new cells (daughter cells) each with a full set of\nchromosomes that are identical to each other and to the parent cell. All the cells of an\nanimal\u2019s body therefore contain identical DNA.\nMeiosis. This is the cell division that produces the ova and sperm necessary for sexual\nreproduction. It only occurs in the ovary and testis.\nThe most important function of meiosis it to halve the number of chromosomes so that\nwhen the sperm fertilises the ovum the normal number is regained. Body cells with the full\nset of chromosomes are called diploid cells, while gametes (sperm and ova) with half the\nchromosomes are called haploid cells.\nMeiosis is a more complex process than mitosis as it involves two divisions one after the\nother and the four cells produced are all genetically different from each other and from the\nparent cell.\nThis fact that the cells formed by meiosis are all genetically different from each other and\nfrom the parent cell can be seen in litters of kittens where all the members of the litter are\n36 The Cell As A Factory\ndifferent from each other as well as being different from the parents although they display\ncharacteristics of both.\n3.7 The Cell As A Factory\nTo make the function of the parts of the cell easier to understand and remember you can\ncompare them to a factory. For example:\n\u2022 The nucleus (1) is the managing director of the factory consulting the blueprint (the\nchromosomes) (2);\n\u2022 The mitochondria (3) supply the power\n\u2022 The ribosomes (4) make the products;\n\u2022 The chloroplasts of plant cells (5) supply the fuel (food)\n\u2022 The Golgi apparatus (6) packages the products ready for dispatch;\n\u2022 The ER (7) modifies, stores and transports the products around the factory;\n\u2022 The plasma membrane is the factory wall and the gates (8);\n\u2022 The lysosomes dispose of the waste and worn-out machinery.\nThe cell compared to a factory1\n3.8 Summary\n\u2022 Cells consist of three parts: the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus .\n\u2022 Substances pass through the plasma membrane by diffusion (gases, lipids), osmosis\n(water), active transport (glucose, ions), phagocytosis (particles), pinocytosis (flu-\nids) and exocytosis (particles and fluids).\n\u2022 Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane .

Also in this chapter, the\nimportant concept of homeostasis is defined. You are also introduced to those pesky things\n-- directional terms.\n4.1 Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should know:\n\u2022 the \u201cMrs Gren\u201d characteristics of living organisms\n\u2022 what a tissue is\n\u2022 four basic types of tissues, their general function and where they are found in the body\n\u2022 the basic organisation of the body of vertebrates including the main body cavities and\nthe location of the following major organs: thorax, heart, lungs, thymus, abdomen, liver,\nstomach, spleen, intestines, kidneys, sperm ducts, ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, urinary\nbladder\n\u2022 the 11 body systems\n\u2022 what homeostasis is\n\u2022 directional terms including dorsal, ventral, caudal, cranial, medial, lateral, proximal,\ndistal, rostral, palmar and plantar.

These seven characteristics are sometimes summarized by\nthe words \u201cMRS GREN\u201d. functions of:\nM ovement\nR espiration\nS ensitivity\nG rowth\nR eproduction\nE xcretion\nN utrition\nLiving organisms are made from cells which are organised into tissues and these are them-\nselves combined to form organs and systems.\nSkin cells, muscle cells, skeleton cells and nerve cells, for example. These different types\nof cells are not just scattered around randomly but similar cells that perform the same\nfunction are arranged in groups. These collections of similar cells are known as tissues .\nThere are four main types of tissues in animals. These are:\n44 The Organisation Of Animal Bodies\n\u2022 Epithelial tissues that form linings, coverings and glands,\n\u2022 Connective tissues for transport and support\n\u2022 Muscle tissues for movement and\n\u2022 Nervous tissues for carrying messages.\n4.2.1 Epithelial Tissues\nEpithelium (plural epithelia) is tissue that covers and lines. It covers an organ or lines a\ntube or space in the body. There are several different types of epithelium, distinguished by\nthe different shapes of the cells and whether they consist of only a single layer of cells or\nseveral layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelia - with a single layer of cells\nFigure 29 Diagram 4.1 : Squamous epithelium\nSquamous epithelium\nSquamous epithelium consists of a single layer of flattened cells that are shaped rather like\n\u2018crazy paving\u2019. It is found lining the heart, blood vessels, lung alveoli and body cavities\n(see diagram 4.1). Its thinness allows molecules to diffuse across readily.\n45 Body Organisation\nFigure 30 Diagram 4.2 : Cuboidal epithelium\nCuboidal epithelium\nCuboidal epithelium consists of a single layer of cube shaped cells. It is rare in the body\nbut is found lining kidney tubules (see diagram 4.2). Molecules pass across it by diffusion,\nosmosis and active transport.\n46 The Organisation Of Animal Bodies\nFigure 31 Diagram 4.3 : Columnar epithelium\nColumnar epithelium\nColumnar epithelium consists of column shaped cells. It is found lining the gut from the\nstomach to the anus (see diagram 4.3). Digested food products move across it into the\nblood stream.\nFigure 32 Diagram 4.4 : Columnar epithelium with cilia\nColumnar epithelium with cilia\nColumnar epithelium with cilia on the free surface (also known as the apical side of the\ncell) lines the respiratory tract, fallopian tubes and uterus (see diagram 4.4). The cilia beat\nrhythmically to transport particles.\n47 Body Organisation\nFigure 33 Diagram 4.5 : Transitional epithelium\nTransitional epithelium - with a variable number of layers\nThe cells in transitional epithelium can move over one another allowing it to stretch. It is\nfound in the wall of the bladder (see diagram 4.5).\nStratified epithelia - with several layers of cells\nFigure 34 Diagram 4.6 : Stratified squamous epithelium\nEpithelia with several layers of cells are found where toughness and resistance to abrasion\nare needed.\nStratified squamous epithelium\nStratified squamous epithelium has many layers of flattened cells. It is found lining the\nmouth, cervix and vagina. Cells at the base divide and push up the cells above them and\ncellsatthetoparewornorpushedoffthesurface(seediagram4.6). Thistypeofepithelium\nprotects underlying layers and repairs itself rapidly if damaged.\nKeratinised stratified squamous epithelium\nKeratinised stratified squamous epithelium has a tough waterproof protein called keratin\n48 The Organisation Of Animal Bodies\ndeposited in the cells. It forms the skin found covering the outer surface of mammals. (Skin\nwill be described in more detail in Chapter 5).\n4.2.2 Connective Tissues\nBlood, bone, tendons, cartilage, fibrous connective tissue and fat (adipose) tissue are all\nclassed as connective tissues. They are tissues that are used for supporting the body or\ntransporting substances around the body. They also consist of three parts: they all have\ncells suspended in a ground substance or matrix and most have fibres running through it.\nBlood\nBloodconsistsofamatrix-plasma, withseveraltypesofcellsandcellfragmentssuspended\nin it. The fibres are only evident in blood that has clotted. Blood will be described in detail\nin chapter 8.\nLymph\nLymph is similar in composition to blood plasma with various types of white blood cell\nfloating in it. It flows in lymphatic vessels.\nConnective tissue \u2018proper\u2019\nFigure 35 Diagram 4.7 : Loose connective tissue\nConnective tissue \u2019proper\u2019 consists of a jelly-like matrix with a dense network of collagen\nand elastic fibres and various cells embedded in it. There are various different forms of\n\u2018proper\u2019 connective tissue (see 1, 2 and 3 below).\nLoose connective tissue\nLoose connective tissue is a sticky whitish substance that fills the spaces between organs.\nIt is found in the dermis of the skin (see diagram 4.7).\nDense connective tissue\nDense connective tissue contains lots of thick fibres and is very strong. It forms tendons,\nligaments and heart valves and covers bones and organs like the kidney and liver.\nAdipose tissue\nAdipose tissue consists of cells filled with fat. It forms the fatty layer under the dermis of\nthe skin, around the kidneys and heart and the yellow marrow of the bones.\nFigure 36 Diagram 4.8 : Cartilage\n49 Body Organisation\nCartilage\nCartilage is the \u2018gristle\u2019 of the meat. It consists of a tough jelly-like matrix with cells\nsuspended in it. It may contain collagen and elastic fibres. It is a flexible but tough tissue\nand is found at the ends of bones, in the nose, ear and trachea and between the vertebrae\n(see diagram 4.8).\nBone\nBone consists of a solid matrix made of calcium salts that give it its hardness. Collagen\nfibres running through it give it its strength. Bone cells are found in spaces in the matrix.\nTwo types of bone are found in the skeleton namely spongy and compact bone . They\ndiffer in the way the cells and matrix are arranged. (See Chapter 6 for more details of\nbone).\n4.2.3 Muscle Tissues\nMuscle tissue is composed of cells that contract and move the body. There are three types\nof muscle tissue:\nFigure 37 Diagram 4.9 : Smooth muscle fibres\n50 The Organisation Of Animal Bodies\nSmooth muscle\nSmooth muscle consists of long and slender cells with a central nucleus (see diagram 4.9).\nIt is found in the walls of blood vessels, airways to the lungs and the gut. It changes the\nsizeofthebloodvesselsandhelpsmovefoodandfluidalong. Contractionofsmoothmuscle\nfibres occurs without the conscious control of the animal.\nFigure 38 Diagram 4.10 : Skeletal muscle fibres\nSkeletal muscle\nSkeletal muscle (sometimes called striated , striped or voluntary muscle ) has striped\nfibres with alternating light and dark bands. It is attached to bones and is under the\nvoluntary control of the animal (see diagram 4.10).\nFigure 39 Diagram 4.11 : Cardiac muscle fibres\n51 Body Organisation\nCardiac muscle\nCardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart where it produces the \u2018heart beat\u2019.\nCardiacmusclecellsarebranchedcylinderswithcentralnucleiandfaintstripes(seediagram\n4.11). Each fibre contracts automatically but the heart beat as a whole is controlled by the\npacemaker and the involuntary autonomic nervous system .\nFigure 40 Diagram 4.12 : A motor neuron\n4.2.4 Nervous Tissues\nNervous tissue forms the nerves, spinal cord and brain. Nerve cells or neurons consist of a\ncell body and a long thread or axon that carries the nerve impulse. An insulating sheath of\nfatty material (myelin ) usually surrounds the axon. Diagram 4.12 shows a typical motor\nneuron that sends messages to muscles to contract.\n4.3 Vertebrate Bodies\nWe are so familiar with animals with backbones (i.e. vertebrates) that it seems rather\nunnecessary to point out that the body is divided into three sections. There is a well-\ndefined head that contains the brain, the major sense organs and the mouth, a trunk\nthat contains the other organs and a well-developed tail . Other features of vertebrates\nmay be less apparent. For instance, vertebrates that live on the land have developed a\nflexible neck that is absent in fish where it would be in the way of the gills and interfere\nwith streamlining. Mammals but not other vertebrates have a sheet of muscle called the\ndiaphragm that divides the trunk into the chest region or thorax and the abdomen .\n52 Body Cavities\n4.4 Body Cavities\nFigure 41 Diagram 4.13 : The body cavities\nIn contrast to many primitive animals, vertebrates have spaces or body cavities that\ncontain the body organs. Most vertebrates have a single body cavity but in mammals the\ndiaphragm divides the main cavity into a thoracic and an abdominal cavity . In the\nthoracic cavity the heart and lungs are surrounded by their own membranes so that cavities\narecreatedaroundtheheart-thepericardial cavity, andaroundthelungs\u2013thepleural\ncavity (see diagram 4.13).\n4.5 Organs\nFigure 42 Diagram 4.14 : Cells, tissues and organs forming the digestive system\nJust as the various parts of the cell work together to perform the cell\u2019s functions and a\nlarge number of similar cells make up a tissue, so many different tissues can \u201ccooperate\u201d\nto form an organ that performs a particular function. For example, connective tissues,\nepithelial tissues, muscle tissue and nervous tissue combine to make the organ that we call\n53 Body Organisation\nthe stomach. In turn the stomach combines with other organs like the intestines, liver and\npancreas to form the digestive system (see diagram 4.14).\n4.6 Generalised Plan Of The Mammalian Body\nFigure 43 Diagram 4.15 : The main organs of the vertebrate body\nAt this point it would be a good idea to make yourself familiar with the major organs and\ntheirpositionsinthebodyofamammalliketherabbit. Diagram4.15showsthemainbody\norgans.\n54 Body Systems\n4.7 Body Systems\nOrgans do not work in isolation but function in cooperation with other organs and body\nstructures to bring about the MRS GREN functions necessary to keep an animal alive. For\nexamplethestomachcanonlyworkinconjunctionwiththemouthandoesophagus(gullet).\nThese provide it with the food it breaks down and digests. It then needs to pass the food\non to the intestines etc. for further digestion and absorption. The organs involved with the\ntaking of food into the body, the digestion and absorption of the food and elimination of\nwaste products are collectively known as the digestive system.\n4.7.1 The 11 body systems\n1. Skin\nThe skin covering the body consists of two layers, the epidermis and dermis .\nAssociatedwiththeselayersarehairs, feathers, claws, hoofs, glandsandsenseorgans\nof the skin.\n2. Skeletal System\nThis can be divided into the bones of the skeleton and the joints where the bones\nmove over each other.\n3. Muscular System\nThe muscles, in conjunction with the skeleton and joints, give the body the ability\nto move.\n4. Cardiovascular System\nThis is also known as the circulatory system. It consists of the heart, the blood\nvessels and the blood. It transports substances around the body.\n5. Lymphatic System\nThis system is responsible for collecting and \u201ccleaning\u201d the fluid that leaks out of\nthe blood vessels. This fluid is then returned to the blood system. The lymphatic\nsystem also makes antibodies that protect the body from invasion by bacteria etc.\nIt consists of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, the spleen and thymus glands.\n6. Respiratory System\nThisisthesysteminvolvedwithbringingoxygenintheairintothebodyandgetting\nrid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of processes that occur in the cell. It\nis made up of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, diaphragm, ribs and muscles\nthat move the ribs in breathing.\n7. Digestive System\nThis is also known as the gastrointestinal system , alimentary system or gut .\nIt consists of the digestive tube and glands like the liver and pancreas that produce\ndigestive secretions. It is concerned with breaking down the large molecules in foods\ninto smaller ones that can be absorbed into the blood and lymph. Waste material is\nalso eliminated by the digestive system.\n8. Urinary System\nThis is also known as the renal system . It removes waste products from the blood\nand is made up of the kidneys, ureters and bladder.\n9. Reproductive System\n55 Body Organisation\nThis is the system that keeps the species going by making new individuals. It is\nmade up of the ovaries, uterus, vagina and fallopian tubes in the female and the\ntestes with associated glands and ducts in the male.\n10. Nervous System\nThissystem coordinatesthe activities of thebody and responses tothe environment.\nIt consists of the sense organs (eye, ear, semicircular canals, and organs of taste and\nsmell), the nerves, brain and spinal cord.\n11. Endocrine System\nThis is the system that produces chemical messengers or hormones. It consists of\nvarious endocrine glands (ductless glands) that include the pituitary, adrenal,\nthyroid and pineal glands as well as the testes and ovary.\n4.8 Homeostasis\nAll the body systems, except the reproductive system, are involved with keeping the con-\nditions inside the animal more or less stable. This is called homeostasis . These constant\nconditions are essential for the survival and proper functioning of the cells, tissues and or-\ngans of the body. The skin, for example, has an important role in keeping the temperature\nof the body constant. The kidneys keep the concentration of salts in the blood within limits\nand the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas maintain the correct level of glucose in the\nblood through the hormone insulin. As long as the various body processes remain within\nnormal limits, the body functions properly and is healthy. Once homeostasis is disturbed\ndisease or death may result. (See Chapters 12 and16 for more on homeostasis).\n56 Directional Terms\n4.9 Directional Terms\nFigure 44 Diagram 4.16 : The directional terms used with animals\n57 Body Organisation\nFigure 45 Diagram 4.17 : Transverse and longitudinal sections of a mouse\nIn the following chapters the systems of the body in the list above will be covered one by\none. For each one the structure of the organs involved will be described and the way they\nfunction will be explained.\nIn order to describe structures in the body of an animal it is necessary to have a system for\ndescribing the position of parts of the body in relation to other parts. For example it may\nbe necessary to describe the position of the liver in relation to the diaphragm, or the heart\nin relation to the lungs. Certainly if you work further with animals, in a veterinary clinic\nfor example, it will be necessary to be able to accurately describe the position of an injury.\nThe terms used for this are called directional terms .\n58 Directional Terms\nThe most common directional terms are right and left . However, even these are not\ncompletely straightforward especially when looking at diagrams of animals. The convention\nis to show the left side of the animal or organ on the right side of the page. This is the\nview you would get looking down on an animal lying on its back during surgery or in a\npost-mortem. Sometimes it is useful to imagine \u2018getting inside\u2019 the animal (so to speak) to\ncheck which side is which. The other common and useful directional terms are listed below\nand shown in diagram 4.16.\nTerm Definition Example\nDorsal Nearer the back of the animal The backbone is dorsal to the\nthan belly\nVentral Nearer the belly of the animal The breastbone is ventral to\nthan the heart\nCranial (or ante- Nearer to the skull than The diaphragm is cranial to\nrior) the stomach\nCaudal (or poste- Nearer to the tail than The ribs are caudal to the\nrior) neck\nProximal Closer to the body than (only The shoulder is proximal to\nused for structures on limbs) the elbow\nDistal Further from the body than The ankle is distal to the\n(only used for structures on knee\nlimbs)\nMedial Nearer to the midline than The bladder is medial to the\nhips\nLateral Further from the midline than The ribs are lateral to the\nlungs\nRostral Towards the muzzle There are more grey hairs in\nthe rostral part of the head\nPalmar The \u201dwalking\u201d surface of the There is a small cut on the\nfront paw left palmar surface\nPlantar The \u201dwalking\u201d surface of the The pads are on the plantar\nhind paw side of the foot\nNote that we don\u2019t use the terms superior and inferior for animals. They are only used\nto describe the position of structures in the human body (and possibly apes) where the\nupright posture means some structures are above or superior to others.\nIn order to look at the structure of some of the parts or organs of the body it may be\nnecessary to cut them open or even make thin slices of them that they can be examined\nunder the microscope. The direction and position of slices or sections through an animal\u2019s\nbody have their own terminology.\nIf an animal or organ is sliced lengthwise this section is called a longitudinal or sagittal\nsection . This is sometimes abbreviated to LS.\nIf the section is sliced crosswise it is called a transverse or cross section . This is\nsometimes abbreviated to TS or XS (see diagram 4.17).\n59 Body Organisation\n4.10 Summary\n\u2022 The characteristics of living organisms can be summarised by the words \u201cMRS GREN\n.\u201d\n\u2022 There are 4 main types of tissue namely: epithelial, connective, muscle and nervous\ntissues .\n\u2022 Epithelial tissues form the skin and line the gut, respiratory tract, bladder etc.\n\u2022 Connective tissues form tendons, ligaments, adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone,\nand are found in the dermis of the skin.\n\u2022 Muscular tissues contract and consist of 3 types: smooth, skeletal and cardiac .\n\u2022 Vertebrate bodies have a head, trunk and tail . Body organs are located in body\ncavities . 11 body systems perform essential body functions most of which maintain a\nstable environment or homeostasis within the animal.\n\u2022 Directional terms describe the location of parts of the body in relation to other parts.\n4.11 Worksheets\nStudents often find it hard learning how to use directional terms correctly.

Each chapter from now on\nwill cover one body system.\nThe skin, sometimes known as the Integumentary System is, in fact, the largest organ of\nthebody. It hasa complex structure, beingcomposed of manydifferenttissues. It performs\nmany functions that are important in maintaining homeostasis in the body.

There is the dry warty skin of toads and\ncrocodiles, the wet slimy skin of fish and frogs, the hard shell of tortoises and the soft\n63 The Skin\nsupple skin of snakes and humans. Mammalian skin is covered with hair, that of birds with\nfeathers, and fish and reptiles have scales. Pigment in the skin, hairs or feathers can make\nthe outer surface almost any colour of the rainbow.\nSkin is one of the largest organs of the body, making up 6-8% of the total\nbody weight. It consists of two distinct layers. The top layer is called the epidermis\nandunderthatisthedermis\u2019\nThe epidermis is the layer that bubbles up when we have a blister and as we know from this\nexperience, it has no blood or nervesin it. The cells at the base of the epidermis continually\ndivide and push the cells above them upwards. As these cells move up they die and become\nthe dry flaky scales that fall off the skin surface. The cells in the epidermis die because\na special protein called keratin is deposited in them. Keratin is an extremely important\nsubstance for it makes the skin waterproof. Without it land vertebrates like reptiles, birds\nand mammals would, like frogs, be able to survive only in damp places.\n5.3 Skin Structures Made Of Keratin\n5.3.1 Claws, Nails and Hoofs\nReptiles, birds and mammals all have nails or claws on the ends of their toes. They protect\nthe end of the toe and may be used for grasping, grooming, digging or in defense. They\nare continually worn away and grow continuously from a growth layer at their base (see\ndiagram 5.2).\nFigure 47\nDiagram 5.2 - A carnivore\u2019s claw\n64 Skin Structures Made Of Keratin\nHoofs are found in sheep, cows, horses etc. otherwise known as ungulate mammals .\nThese are animals that have lost toes in the process of evolution and walk on the \u201cnails\u201d of\nthe remaining toes. The hoof is a cylinder of horny material that surrounds and protects\nthe tip of the toe (see diagram 5.3).\nFigure 48\nDiagram 5.3 - A horse\u2019s hoof\n5.3.2 Horns And Antlers\nTrue horns are made of keratin and are found in sheep, goats and cattle. They are never\nbranched and, once grown, are never shed. They consist of a core of bone arising in the\ndermisoftheskinandarefusedwiththeskull. Thehornitselfformsasahollowcone-shaped\nsheath around the bone (see diagram 5.4).\n65 The Skin\nFigure 49\nDiagram 5.4 - A horn\nThe antlers of male deer have quite a different structure. They are not formed in the\nepidermis and do not consist of keratin but are entirely of bone. They are shed each year\nand are often branched, especially in older animals. When growing they are covered in skin\ncalled velvet that forms the bone. Later the velvet is shed to leave the bony antler. The\nvelvet is often removed artificially to be sold in Asia as a traditional medicine (see diagram\n5.5).\n66 Skin Structures Made Of Keratin\nFigure 50\nDiagram 5.5 - A deer antler\nOther animals have projections on their heads that are not true horns either. The horns\non the head of giraffes are made of bone covered with skin and hair, and the \u2018horn\u2019 of a\nrhinoceros is made of modified and fused hair-like structures.\n5.3.3 Hair\nHair is also made of keratin and develops in the epidermis. It covers the body of most\nmammals where it acts as an insulator and helps to regulate the temperature of the body\n(seebelow). Thecolourinhairsisformedfromthesamepigment, melaninthatcoloursthe\nskin. Coat colour may help camouflage animals and sometimes acts to attract the opposite\nsex.\n67 The Skin\nFigure 51\nDiagram 5.6 - A hair\nHairs lie in a follicle and grow from a root that is well supplied with blood vessels. The\nhair itself consists of layers of dead keratin - containing cells and usually lies at a slant in\nthe skin. A small bundle of smooth muscle fibres (the hair erector muscle ) is attached\nto the side of each hair and when this contracts the hair stands on end. This increases the\ninsulating power of the coat and is also used by some animals to make them seem larger\nwhen confronted by a foe or a competitor(see diagram 5.6).\nThe whiskers of cats and the spines of hedgehogs are examples of special types of hairs.\n5.3.4 Feathers\nThe lightness and stiffness of keratin is also a key to bird flight. In the form of feathers it\nprovidesthelargeairfoilsnecessaryforflappingandglidingflight. Inanotherform,thelight\nfluffy down feathers,also made of keratin, are some of the best natural insulators known.\nThis superior insulation is necessary to help maintain the high body temperatures of birds.\n68 Skin Structures Made Of Keratin\nFigure 52\nDiagram 5.7 - A Contour Feather\nCountour feathers are large feathers that cover the body, wings and tail. They have an\nexpanded vane that provides the smooth, continuous surface that is required for effective\nflight. This surface is formed by barbs that extend out from the central shaft. If you look\ncarefullyatafeatheryoucanseethatoneithersideofeachbarbarethousandsofbarbules\nthat lock together by a complex system of hooks and notches. if this arrangement becomes\ndisrupted, the bird uses its beak to draw the barbs and barbules together again in an action\nknown as preening (see diagram 5.7).\n69 The Skin\nFigure 53\nDiagram 5.8 - A Down Feather\n70 Skin Glands\nFigure 54\nDiagram 5.9 - A Pin Feather\nDown feathers are the only feathers covering a chick and form the main insulation layer\nunder the contour feathers of the adult. They have no shaft but consist of a sprayof simple,\nslender branches (see diagram 5.8).\nPin feathers have a slender hair-like shaft often with a tiny tuft of barbs on the end. They\nare found between the other feathers and help tell a bird how its feathers are lying (see\ndiagram 5.9).\n5.4 Skin Glands\nGlandsareorgansthatproduceandsecretefluids. Theyareusuallydividedintotwogroups\ndepending upon whether or not they have channels or ducts to carry their products away.\nGlands with ducts are called exocrine glands and include the glands found in the skin as\nwell as the glands that produce digestive enzymes in the gut. Endocrine glands have no\n71 The Skin\nducts and release their products (hormones) directly into the blood stream. The pituitary\nand adrenal glands are examples of endocrine glands.\nMost vertebrates have exocrine glands in the skin that produce a variety of secretions. The\nslimeontheskinoffishandfrogsismucusproducedbyskinglandsandsomefishandfrogs\nalso produce poison from modified glands. In fact the skin glands of some frogs produce\nthe most poisonous chemicals known. Reptiles and birds have a dry skin with few glands.\nThe preen gland , situated near the base of the bird\u2019s tail, produces oil to help keep the\nfeathers in good condition. Mammals have an array of different skin glands. These include\nthe wax producing, sweat, sebaceous and mammary glands.\nWax producing glands are found in the ears.\nSebaceous glands secrete an oily secretion into the hair follicle. This secretion, known as\nsebum , keeps the hair supple and helps prevent the growth of bacteria (see diagram 5.6).\nSweat glands consist of a coiled tube and a duct leading onto the skin surface. Their\nappearance when examined under the microscope inspired one of the first scientists to\nobserve them to call them \u201cfairies\u2019 intestines\u201d (see diagram 5.1). Sweat contains salt and\nwasteproductslikeureaandtheevaporationofsweatontheskinsurfaceisoneofthemajor\nmechanisms for cooling the body of many mammals. Horses can sweat up to 30 litres of\nfluid a day during active exercise, but cats and dogs have few sweat glands and must cool\nthemselves by panting. Scent in the sweat of many animals is used to mark territory or\nattract the opposite sex.\nMammary glands are only present in mammals. They are thought to be modified se-\nbaceous glands and are present in both sexes but are rarely active in males (see diagram\n5.10). The number of glands varies from species to species. They open to the surface in\nwell-developed nipples. Milk contains proteins, sugars, fats and salts, although the exact\ncomposition varies from one species to another.\n72 The Skin And Sun\nFigure 55\nDiagram 5.10 - A Mammary Gland\n5.5 The Skin And Sun\nA moderate amount of UV in sunlight is necessary for the skin to form vitamin D . This\nvitaminpreventsbonedisorderslikericketstowhichanimalsrearedindoorsaresusceptible.\nExcessive exposure to the UV in sunlight can be damaging and the pigment melanin ,\ndeposited in cells at the base of the epidermis, helps to protect the underlying layers of\nthe skin from this damage. Melanin also colours the skin and variations in the amount of\nmelanin produces colours from pale yellow to black.\n5.5.1 Sunburn And Skin Cancer\nExcessexposuretothesuncancausesunburn. Thisiscommoninhumans,butlightskinned\nanimals like cats and pigs can also be sunburned, especially on the ears. Skin cancer can\nalso result from excessive exposure to the sun. As holes in the ozone layer increase exposure\nto the sun\u2019s UV rays, so too does the rate of skin cancer in humans and animals.\n73 The Skin\n5.6 The Dermis\nThe underlying layer of the skin, known as the dermis, is much thicker but much more\nuniforminstructurethantheepidermis(seediagram5.1).

The dermis is well supplied\nwith blood vessels, so cuts and burns that penetrate down into the dermis will bleed or\ncause serious fluid loss. There are also numerous nerve endings and touch receptors in the\ndermis because, of course, the skin is sensitive to touch, pain and temperature.\nWhen looking at a section of the skin under the microscope you can see hair follicles, sweat\nand sebaceous glands dipping down into the dermis. However, these structures do not\noriginate in the dermis but are derived from the epidermis.\nIn the lower levels of the dermis is a layer of fat or adipose tissue (see diagram 5.1). This\nacts as an energy store and is an excellent insulator especially in mammals like whales with\nlittle hair.\n5.7 The Skin And Temperature Regulation\nVertebrates can be divided into two groups depending on whether or not they control\ntheir internal temperature. Amphibia (frogs) and reptiles are said to be\u201dcold blooded\n\u201d (poikilothermic ) because their body temperature approximately follows that of the\nenvironment. Birds and mammals are said to be warm blooded (homoiothermic )\nbecause they can maintain a roughly constant body temperature despite changes in the\ntemperature of the environment.\nHeat is produced by the biochemical reactions of the body (especially in the liver) and by\nmuscle contraction. Most of the heat loss from the body occurs via the skin. It is therefore\nnot surprising that many of the mechanisms for controlling the temperature of the body\noperate here.\n5.7.1 Reduction Of Heat Loss\nWhen an animal is in a cold environment and needs to reduce heat loss the erector muscles\ncontract causing the hair or feathers to rise up and increase the layer of insulating air\ntrapped by them (see diagram 5.11a).\nFigure 56\nDiagram 5.11a) Hair muscle relaxed...............Diagram 5.11b) Hair muscle contracted\nHeat loss from the skin surface can also be reduced by the contraction of the abundant\nblood vessels that lie in the dermis. This takes blood flow to deeper levels, so reducing heat\nloss and causing pale skin (see diagram 5.12a).\n74 The Skin And Temperature Regulation\nFigure 57\nDiagram 5.12a) Reduction of heat loss by skin\nShivering caused by twitching muscles produces heat that also helps raise the body temper-\nature.\n5.7.2 Increase Of Heat Loss\nThere are two main mechanisms used by animals to increase the amount of heat lost from\nthe skin when they are in a hot environment or high levels of activity are increasing internal\nheat production. The first is the expansion of the blood vessels in the dermis so blood flows\nnear the skin surface and heat loss to the environment can take place. The second is by the\nproduction of sweat from the sweat glands (see diagram 5.12b). The evaporation of this\nliquid on the skin surface produces a cooling effect.\nThe mechanisms for regulating body temperature are under the control of a small region of\nthe brain called the hypothalamus . This acts like a thermostat.\n75 The Skin\nFigure 58\nDiagram 5.12b) - Increase of heat loss by skin\n5.7.3 Heat Loss And Body Size\nThe amount of heat that can be lost from the surface of the body is related to the area of\nskin an animal has in relation to the total volume of its body.\nSmall animals like mice have a very large skin area compared to their total volume. This\nmeans they tend to loose large amounts of heat and have difficulty keeping warm in cold\nweather. They may need to keep active just to maintain their body temperature or may\nhibernate to avoid the problem.\nLarge animals like elephants have the opposite problem. They have only a relatively small\nskin area in relation to their total volume and may have trouble keeping cool. This is one\nreason that these large animals tend to have sparse coverings of hair.\n5.8 Summary\n\u2022 Skin consists of two layers: the thin epidermis and under it the thicker dermis.\n\u2022 TheEpidermisisformedbythedivisionofbasecellsthatpushthoseabovethemtowards\nthe surface where they die and are shed.\n\u2022 Keratin , a protein, is deposited in the epidermal cells.

The rest of the\nskeleton of all these animals (except the fish) also has the same basic design with a skull\nthat houses and protects the brain and sense organs and ribs that protect the heart and\nlungs and, in mammals, make breathing possible. Each of the four limbs is made to the\nsame basic pattern. It is joined to the spine by means of a flat, broad bone called a girdle\nand consists of one long upper bone, two long lower bones, several smaller bones in the\nwrist or ankle and five digits (see diagrams 6.1 18,19 and 20).\nFigure 60\nDiagram 6.1 - The mammalian skeleton\n80 The Vertebral Column\n6.2 The Vertebral Column\nThe vertebral column consists of a series of bones called vertebrae linked together to form\na flexible column with the skull at one end and the tail at the other. Each vertebra consists\nof a ring of bone with spines (spinous process) protruding dorsally from it. The spinal cord\npasses through the hole in the middle and muscles attach to the spines making movement\nof the body possible (see diagram 6.2).\nFigure 61\nDiagram 6.2 - Cross section of a lumbar vertebre\nThe shape and size of the vertebrae of mammals vary from the neck to the tail. In the neck\nthere are cervical vertebrae with the two top ones, the atlas and axis , being specialised\nto support the head and allow it to nod \u201cYes\u201d and shake \u201cNo\u201d. Thoracic vertebrae in the\nchest region have special surfaces against which the ribs move during breathing. Grazing\nanimals like cows and giraffes that have to support weighty heads on long necks have extra\nlarge spines on their cervical and thoracic vertebrae for muscles to attach to. Lumbar\nvertebrae in the loin region are usually large strong vertebrae with prominent spines for\nthe attachment of the large muscles of the lower back. The sacral vertebrae are usually\nfused into one solid bone called the sacrum that sits within the pelvic girdle . Finally\nthere are a variable number of small bones in the tail called the coccygeal vertebrae (see\ndiagram 6.3).\n81 The Skeleton\nFigure 62\nDiagram 6.3 - The regions of the vertebral column dik\n6.3 The Skull\nThe skull of mammals consists of 30 separate bones that grow together during development\nto form a solid case protecting the brain and sense organs. The \u201cbox \u201cenclosing and pro-\ntecting the brain is called the cranium (see diagram 6.4). The bony wall of the cranium\nencloses the middle and inner ears, protects the organs of smell in the nasal cavity and the\neyes in sockets known as orbits . The teeth are inserted into the upper and lower jaws (see\nChapter 5 for more on teeth) The lower jaw is known as the mandible . It forms a joint\nwith the skull moved by strong muscles that allow an animal to chew. At the front of the\nskull is the nasal cavity, separated from the mouth by a plate of bone called the palate .\nBehind the nasal cavity and connecting with it are the sinuses . These are air spaces in the\nbones of the skull which help keep the skull as light as possible. At the base of the cranium\nis the foramen magnum , translated as \u201cbig hole\u201d, through which the spinal cord passes.\nOn either side of this are two small, smooth rounded knobs or condyles that articulate\n(move against) the first or Atlas vertebra.\n82 The Rib\nFigure 63\nDiagram 6.4 - A dog\u2019s skull\n6.4 The Rib\nPaired ribs are attached to each thoracic vertebra against which they move in breathing.\nEach rib is attached ventrally either to the sternum or to the rib in front by cartilage\nto form the rib cage that protects the heart and lungs. In dogs one pair of ribs is not\nattached ventrally at all. They are called floating ribs (see diagram 6.5). Birds have a\nlarge expanded sternum called the keel to which the flight muscles (the \u2018breast\u201d meat of a\nroast chicken) are attached.\n83 The Skeleton\nFigure 64\nDiagram 6.5 - The rib\n6.5 The Forelimb\nThe forelimb consists of: Humerus, radius and ulna, carpals, metacarpals, digits or\nphalanges (see diagram 6.6). The top of the humerus moves against (articulates with)\nthe scapula at the shoulder joint. By changing the number, size and shape of the various\nbones,forelimbshaveevolvedtofitdifferentwaysoflife. Theyhavebecomewingsforflying\nin birds and bats, flippers for swimming in whales, seals and porpoises, fast and efficient\nlimbs for running in horses and arms and hands for holding and manipulating in primates\n(see diagram 6.8).\n84 The Forelimb\nFigure 65\nDiagram 6.6 - Forelimb of a dog\n85 The Skeleton\nFigure 66\nDiagram 6.7. Hindlimb of a dog\n6.6 The Hind Limb\nThe hind limbs have a similar basic pattern to the forelimb. They consist of: femur, tibia\nand fibula, tarsals, metatarsals, digits or phalanges (see diagram 6.7). The top of the\nfemur moves against (articulates with) the pelvis at the hip joint.\n86 The Girdles\nFigure 67\nDiagram 6.8 - Various vertebrate limbs\nFigure 68\nDiagram 6.9 - Forelimb of a horse\nThis diagram is wrong. The Long pastern or proximal phalanx is P1, not P3. The distal\nphalanx or coffin bone (called hoof there) is the 3rd phalanges. The patella or kneecap is\nembedded in a large tendon in front of the knee. It seems to smooth the movements of the\nknee. The legs of the horse are highly adapted to give it great galloping speed over long\ndistances. The bones of the leg, wrist and foot are greatly elongated and the hooves are\nactually the tips of the third fingers and toes, the other digits having been lost or reduced\n(see diagram 6.9).\n6.7 The Girdles\nThe girdles pass on the \u201cpush\u201d produced by the limbs to the body. The shoulder girdle or\nscapula is a triangle of bone surrounded by the muscles of the back but not connected\n87 The Skeleton\ndirectly to the spine (see diagram 6.1). This arrangement helps it to cushion the body\nwhen landing after a leap and gives the forelimbs the flexibility to manipulate food or\nstrike at prey. Animals that use their forelimbs for grasping, burrowing or climbing have a\nwell-developed clavicle or collar bone. This connects the shoulder girdle to the sternum.\nAnimals like sheep, horses and cows that use their forelimbs only for supporting the body\nand locomotion have no clavicle. The pelvic girdle or hipbone attaches the sacrum and\nthe hind legs. It transmits the force of the leg-thrust in walking or jumping directly to the\nspine (see diagram 6.10).\nFigure 69\nDiagram 6.10 - The pelvic girdle\n6.8 Categories Of Bones\nPeople who study skeletons place the different bones of the skeleton into groups according\nto their shape or the way in which they develop. Thus we have long bones like the femur,\nradiusandfingerbones, short bonesliketheonesofthewristandankle, irregular bones\n88 Bird Skeletons\nlike the vertebrae and flat bones like the shoulder blade and bones of the skull. Finally\nthere are bones that develop in tissue separated from the main skeleton. These include\nsesamoid bones which include bones like the patella or kneecap that develop in tendons\nand visceral bones that develop in the soft tissue of the penis of the dog and the cow\u2019s\nheart.\n6.9 Bird Skeletons\nAlthough the skeleton of birds is made up of the same bones as that of mammals, many are\nhighly adapted for flight. The most noticeable difference is that the bones of the forelimbs\nareelongatedtoactaswings. Thelargeflightmusclesmakeupasmuchas1/5thofthebody\nweight and are attached to an extension of the sternum called the keel . The vertebrae of\nthe lower back are fused to provide the rigidity needed to produce flying movements. There\nare also many adaptations to reduce the weight of the skeleton. For instance birds have a\nbeak rather than teeth and many of the bones are hollow (see diagram 6.11).\nFigure 70\nDiagram 6.11 - A bird\u2019s skeleton\n89 The Skeleton\n6.10 The Structure Of Long Bones\nA long bone consists of a central portion or shaft and two ends called epiphyses (see\ndiagram 6.12). Long bones move against or articulate with other bones at joints and their\nends have flattened surfaces and rounded protuberances (condyles) to make this possible. If\nyou carefully examine a long bone you may also see raised or rough surfaces. This is where\nthe muscles that move the bones are attached. You will also see holes (a hole is called a\nforamen ) in the bone. Blood vessels and nerves pass into the bone through these. You\nmay also be able to see a fine line at each end of the bone. This is called the growth plate\nor epiphyseal line and marks the place where increase in length of the bone occurred (see\ndiagram 6.16).\nFigure 71\n90 The Structure Of Long Bones\nDiagram 6.12 - A femur\nFigure 72\n6.13 - A longitudinal section through a long bone\nIf you cut a long bone lengthways you will see it consists of a hollow cylinder (see diagram\n6.13). Theoutershelliscoveredbyatoughfibroussheathtowhichthetendonsareattached.\nUnder this is a layer of hard, dense compact bone (see below). This gives the bone its\nstrength. The central cavity contains fatty yellow marrow , an important energy store for\nthe body, and the ends are made from honeycomb-like bony material called spongy bone\n(see box below). Spongy bone contains red marrow where red blood cells are made.\n91 The Skeleton\n6.11 Compact Bone\nCompactboneisnotthelifelessmaterialitmayappearatfirstglance. Itisalivingdynamic\ntissue with blood vessels, nerves and living cells that continually rebuild and reshape the\nbone structure as a result of the stresses, bends and breaks it experiences. Compact bone is\ncomposed of microscopic hollow cylinders that run parallel to each other along the length of\nthe bone. Each of these cylinders is called a Haversian system . Blood vessels and nerves\nrun along the central canal of each Haversian system. Each system consists of concentric\nrings of bone material (the matrix ) with minute spaces in it that hold the bone cells. The\nhard matrix contains crystals of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and magnesium\nsalts with collagen fibres that make the bone stronger and somewhat flexible. Tiny canals\nconnect the cells with each other and their blood supply (see diagram 6.14).\nFigure 73\n92 Spongy Bone\nDiagram 6.14 - Haversian systems of compact bone\n6.12 Spongy Bone\nSpongybonegivesboneslightnesswithstrength. Itconsistsofanirregularlatticethatlooks\njust like an old fashioned loofah sponge (see diagram 6.15). It is found on the ends of long\nbones and makes up most of the bone tissue of the limb girdles, ribs, sternum, vertebrae\nand skull. The spaces contain red marrow, which is where red blood cells are made and\nstored.\nFigure 74\nDiagram 6.15 - Spongy bone\n6.13 Bone Growth\nThe skeleton starts off in the foetus as either cartilage or fibrous connective tissue. Before\nbirthand, sometimesforyearsafterit, thecartilageisgraduallyreplacedbybone. Thelong\nbones increase in length at the ends at an area known as the epiphyseal plate where new\ncartilage is laid down and then gradually converted to bone. When an animal is mature,\nbone growth ceases and the epiphyseal plate converts into a fine epiphyseal line (see\ndiagram 6.16).\nFigure 75\n93 The Skeleton\nDiagram 6.16 - A growing bone\n6.14 Broken Bones\nA fracture or break dramatically demonstrates the dynamic nature of bone. Soon after the\nbreak occurs blood pours into the site and cartilage is deposited. This starts to connect the\nbroken ends together. Later spongy bone replaces the cartilage, which is itself replaced by\ncompact bone. Partial healing to the point where some weight can be put on the bone can\ntake place in 6 weeks but complete healing may take 3-4 months.\n6.15 Joints\nJoints are the structures in the skeleton where 2 or more bones meet. There are several\ndifferent types of joints. Some are immovable once the animal has reached maturity.\nExamples of these are those between the bones of the skull and the midline joint of the\npelvic girdle. Some are slightly moveable like the joints between the vertebrae but most\njoints allow free movement and have a typical structure with a fluid filled cavity separating\nthe articulating surfaces (surfaces that move against each other) of the two bones. This\nkind of joint is called a synovial joint (see diagram 6.17). The joint is held together by\nbundles of white fibrous tissue called ligaments and a fibrous capsule encloses the joint.\nThe inner layers of this capsule secrete the synovial fluid that acts as a lubricant. The\narticulating surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage that also reduces friction and\nsome joints, e.g. the knee, have a pad of cartilage between the surfaces that articulate with\neach other.\nThe shape of the articulating bones in a joint and the arrangement of ligaments determine\nthe kind of movement made by the joint. Some joints only allow a to and from gliding\nmovemente.g. betweentheankleandwristbones; thejointsattheelbow,kneeandfingers\nare hinge joints and allow movement in two dimensions and the axis vertebra pivots on\nthe atlas vertebra. Ball and socket joints , like those at the shoulder and hip, allow the\ngreatest range of movement.\n94 Common Names Of Joints\nFigure 76\nDiagram 6.17 - A synovial joint\n6.16 Common Names Of Joints\nSome joints in animals are given common names that tend to be confusing. For example:\n1. The joint between the femur and the tibia on the hind leg is our knee but the stifle\nin animals.\n2. Our ankle joint (between the tarsals and metatarsals) is the hock in animals\n3. Our knuckle joint (between the metacarpals or metatarsals and the phalanges) is the\nfetlock in the horse.\n4. The \u201cknee\u201d on the horse is equivalent to our wrist (ie on the front limb between the\nradius and metacarpals) see diagrams 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.17 and 6.18.\n95 The Skeleton\nFigure 77\nDiagram 6.18 - The names of common joints of a horse\nFigure 78\nDiagarm 6.19 - The names of common joints of a dog\n96 Locomotion\n6.17 Locomotion\nDifferent animals place different parts of the foot or forelimb on the ground when walking\nor running.\nHumans and bears put the whole surface of the foot on the ground when they walk. This is\nknown as plantigrade locomotion . Dogs and cats walk on their toes (digitigrade loco-\nmotion)whilehorsesandpigswalkontheir\u201ctoenails\u201dorhoofs.

They consist of: cervical\nvertebrae in the neck, thoracic vertebrae in the chest region which articulate with\nthe ribs, lumbar vertebrae in the loin region, sacral vertebrae fused to the pelvis to\nform the sacrum and tail or coccygeal vertebrae .\n\u2022 The skull protects the brain and sense organs. The cranium forms a solid box enclosing\nthe brain. The mandible forms the jaw.\n\u2022 The forelimb consists of the humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and pha-\nlanges .

The\nmeat on the chop or roast is muscle and is composed mainly of protein. The cells that make\nup muscle tissue are elongated and able to contract to a half or even a third of their length\nwhen at rest. There are three different kinds of muscle based on appearance and function:\nsmooth, cardiac and skeletal muscle.\n7.2.1 Types of Muscle\n\u2022 Smooth muscle\nSmooth or Involuntary muscle carries out the unconscious routine tasks of the body such\nas moving food down the digestive system, keeping the eyes in focus and adjusting the\ndiameter of blood vessels. The individual cells are spindle-shaped, being fatter in the\nmiddle and tapering off towards the ends with a nucleus in the centre of the cell. They\nare usually found in sheets and are stimulated by the non-conscious or autonomic nervous\nsystem as well as by hormones (see Chapter 3).\n\u2022 Cardiac muscle\nCardiac muscle is only found in the wall of the heart. It is composed of branching fibres\nthat form a three-dimensional network. When examined under the microscope, a central\nnucleus and faint stripes or striations can be seen in the cells. Cardiac muscle cells contract\nspontaneously and rhythmically without outside stimulation, but the sinoatrial node (nat-\nural pacemaker) coordinates the heart beat. Nerves and hormones modify this rhythm (see\nChapter 3).\n\u2022 Skeletal muscle\nSkeletal muscle is the muscle that is attached to and moves the skeleton, and is under\nvoluntary control. It is composed of elongated cells or fibres lying parallel to each other.\nEach cell is unusual in that it has several nuclei and when examined under the microscope\nappearsstripedorstriated. Thisappearancegivesthemuscleitsnamesofstripedorstriated\nmuscle. Each cell of striated muscle contains hundreds, or even thousands, of microscopic\nfibres each one with its own striped appearance. The stripes are formed by two different\nsorts of protein that slide over each other making the cell contract (see diagram 7.1).\n102 Muscles\nFigure 83\nDiagram 7.1 - A striped muscle cell\n7.2.2 Muscle contraction\nMusclecontractionrequiresenergyandmusclecellshavenumerousmitochondria. However,\nonlyabout15%oftheenergyreleasedbythemitochondriaisusedtofuelmusclecontraction.\nThe rest is released as heat. This is why exercise increases body temperature and makes\nanimals sweat or pant to rid themselves of this heat.\nWhatwerefertoasamuscleismadeupofgroupsofmusclefibressurroundedbyconnective\ntissue. The connective tissue sheaths join together at the ends of the muscle to form tough\nwhite bands of fibre called tendons . These attach the muscles to the bones. Tendons\nare similar in structure to the ligaments that attach bones together across a joint (see\ndiagrams 7.2a and b).\n103 Muscles\nFigure 84\nDiagram 7.2 a and b - The structure of a muscle\nRemember:\nTendons Tie muscles to bones\nand\nLigaments Link bones at joints\n7.2.3 Structure of a muscle\nA single muscle is fat in the middle and tapers towards the ends. The middle part, which\ngets fatter when the muscle contracts, is called the belly of the muscle. If you contract\nyour biceps muscle in your upper arm you may feel it getting fatter in the middle. You\nmay also notice that the biceps is attached at its top end to bones in your shoulder while\nat the bottom it is attached to bones in your lower arm. Notice that the bones at only one\nend move when you contract the biceps. This end of the muscle is called the insertion .\nThe other end of the muscle, the origin , is attached to the bone that moves the least (see\ndiagram 7.3).\n104 Muscles\nFigure 85\nDiagram 7.3 - Antagonistic muscles, flexion and extension\n7.2.4 Antagonistic muscles\nSkeletalmusclesusuallyworkinpairs. Whenonecontractstheotherrelaxesandviceversa.\nPairs of muscles that work like this are called antagonistic muscles . For example the\nmuscles in the upper forearm are the biceps and triceps (see diagram 7.3). Together they\nbend the elbow. When the biceps contracts (and the triceps relaxes) the lower forearm\nis raised and the angle of the joint is reduced. This kind of movement is called flexion .\nWhen the triceps is contracted (and the biceps relaxes), the angle of the elbow increases.\nThe term for this movement is extension .\nWhen you or animals contract skeletal muscle it is a voluntary action. For example, you\nmake a conscious decision to walk across the room, raise the spoon to your mouth or smile.\nThere is however, another way in which contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton\nhappens that is not under voluntary control. This is during a reflex action , such as\njerking your hand away from the hot stove you have touched by accident. This is called a\nreflex arc and will be described in detail in chapter 14-15.\n105 Muscles\n7.3 Summary\n\u2022 There are three different kinds of muscle tissue: smooth muscle in the walls of the gut\nand blood\nvessels; cardiac muscle in the heart and skeletal muscle attached to the skeleton.\n\u2022 Tendons attach skeletal muscles to the skeleton.\n\u2022 Ligaments link bones together at a joint.\n\u2022 Skeletal muscles work in pairs known as antagonistic pairs. As one contracts the other\nin the\npair relaxes.\n\u2022 Flexion is the movement that reduces the angle of a joint. Extension increases the\nangle\nof a joint.\n7.4 Test Yourself\n1.

Thisenergyisneededtobuildlargemolecules\nlikeproteinsandglycogen, makethestructuresincells, movechemicalsthroughmembranes\nand around cells, contract muscles, transmit nerve impulses and keep the body warm.\nAnimals get their energy from the large molecules that they eat as food. Glucose is often\ntheenergysourcebutitmayalsocomefromothercarbohydrates,aswellasfatsandprotein.\nThe energy is made by the biochemical process known as cellular respiration that takes\nplace in the mitochondria inside every living cell.\nThe overall reaction can be summarised by the word equation given below.\nCharbohydrate Food (glucose) + Oxygen = Carbon Dioxide + Water + energy\nAs you can see from this equation, the cells need to be supplied with oxygen and glucose\nand the waste product, carbon dioxide , which is poisonous to cells, needs to be removed.\nThe way the digestive system provides the glucose for cellular respiration will be described\nin Chapter 11 (\u201dThe Gut and Digestion\u201d), but here we are only concerned with the two\ngases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, that are involved in cellular respiration. These gases are\ncarried in the blood to and from the tissues where they are required or produced.\nOxygen enters the body from the air (or water in fish)and carbon dioxide is usually elimi-\nnated from the same part of the body. This process is called gas exchange . In fish gas\nexchange occurs in the gills, in land dwelling vertebrates lungs are the gas exchange organs\nand frogs use gills when they are tadpoles and lungs, the mouth and the skin when adults.\nMammals (and birds) are active and have relatively high body temperatures so they require\nlarge amounts of oxygen to provide sufficient energy through cellular respiration. In order\n112 Diffusion And Transport Of Oxygen\nto take in enough oxygen and release all the carbon dioxide produced they need a very large\nsurface area over which gas exchange can take place. The many minute air sacs or alveoli\nof the lungs provide this. When you look at these under the microscope they appear rather\nlike bunches of grapes covered with a dense network of fine capillaries (see diagram 9.1).\nA thin layer of water covers the inner surface of each alveolus. There is only a very small\ndistance -just 2 layers of thin cells - between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the\ncapillaries. The gases pass across this gap by diffusion .\n9.3 Diffusion And Transport Of Oxygen\nFigure 89 Diagram 9.2 : Cross section of an alveolus\nThe air in the alveoli is rich in oxygen while the blood in the capillaries around the alveoli\nis deoxygenated. This is because the haemoglobin in the red blood cells has released all the\noxygenithasbeencarryingtothecellsofthebody. Oxygendiffusesfromhighconcentration\nto low concentration. It therefore crosses the narrow barrier between the alveoli and the\ncapillaries to enter the blood and combine with the haemoglobin in the red blood cells to\nform oxyhaemoglobin .\nThe narrow diameter of the capillaries around the alveoli means that the blood flow is\nslowed down and that the red cells are squeezed against the capillary walls. Both of these\nfactors help the oxygen diffuse into the blood (see diagram 9.2).\nWhenthebloodreachesthecapillariesofthetissuestheoxygensplitsfromthehaemoglobin\nmolecule. It then diffuses into the tissue fluid and then into the cells.\n9.4 Diffusion And Transport Of Carbon Dioxide\nBlood entering the lung capillaries is full of carbon dioxide that it has collected from the\ntissues. Most of the carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma either in the form of sodium\nbicarbonate or carbonic acid . A little is transported by the red blood cells. As the\nbloodentersthelungsthecarbondioxidegasdiffusesthroughthecapillaryandalveoliwalls\ninto the water film and then into the alveoli. Finally it is removed from the lungs during\n113 Respiratory System\nbreathing out (see diagram 9.2). (See chapter 8 for more information about how oxygen\nand carbon dioxide are carried in the blood).\n9.5 The Air Passages\nWhen air is breathed in it passes from the nose to the alveoli of the lungs down a series of\ntubes (see diagram 9.3). After entering the nose the air passes through the nasal cavity\n, which is lined with a moist membrane that adds warmth and moisture to the air as it\npasses. The air then flows through the pharynx or throat, a passage that carries both\nfood and air, to the larynx where the voice-box is located. Here the passages for food and\nair separate again. Food must pass into the oesophagus and the air into the windpipe or\ntrachea . To prevent food entering this, a small flap of tissue called the epiglottis closes\nthe opening during swallowing (see chapter 11). A reflex that inhibits breathing during\nswallowing also (usually) prevents choking on food.\nThe trachea is the tube that ducts the air down the throat. Incomplete rings of cartilage\nin its walls help keep it open even when the neck is bent and head turned. The fact that\nacrobats and people that tie themselves in knots doing yoga still keep breathing during the\nmost contorted manoeuvres shows how effective this arrangement is. The air passage now\ndivides into the two bronchi that take the air to the right and left lungs before dividing\ninto smaller and smaller bronchioles that spread throughout the lungs to carry air to the\nalveoli. Smooth muscles in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles adjust the diameter of\nthe air passages.\nThe tissue lining the respiratory passages producesmucus and is covered with minute hairs\nor cilia. Any dust that is breathed into the respiratory system immediately gets entangled\nin the mucous and the cilia move it towards the mouth or nose where it can be coughed up\nor blown out.\n9.6 The Lungs And The Pleural Cavities\nFigure 90 Diagram 9.3 : The respiratory system\nThelungsfillmostofthechestorthoracic cavity, whichiscompletelyseparatedfromthe\nabdominal cavity by the diaphragm . The lungs and the spaces in which they lie (called\nthe pleural cavities) are covered with membranes called the pleura . There is a thin film\nof fluid between the two membranes. This lubricates them as they move over each other\nduring breathing movements.\n9.6.1 Collapsed Lungs\nThe pleural cavities are completely airtight with no connection with the outside and if\nthey are punctured by accident (a broken rib will often do this), air rushes in and the\nlung collapses. Separating the two lungs is a region of tissue that contains the oesophagus,\n114 Breathing\ntrachea, aorta, vena cava and lymph nodes. This is called the mediastinum . In humans\nand sheep it separates the cavity completely so that puncturing one pleural cavity leads to\nthe collapse of only one lung. In dogs, however, this separation is incomplete so a puncture\nresults in a complete collapse of both lungs.\n9.7 Breathing\nFigure 91 Diagram 9.4a : Inspiration; Diagram 9.4b : Expiration\nThe process of breathing moves air in and out of the lungs. Sometimes this process is\ncalled respiration but it is important not to confuse it with the chemical process, cellular\nrespiration , that takes place in the mitochondria of cells. Breathing is brought about by\nthe movement of the diaphragm and the ribs.\n9.7.1 Inspiration\nThe diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle that completely separates the abdominal and\nthoracic cavities. When at rest it domes up into the thoracic cavity but during breathing\nin or inspiration it flattens. At the same time special muscles in the chest wall move the\nribs forwards and outwards. These movements of both the diaphragm and the ribs cause\nthe volume of the thorax to increase. Because the pleural cavities are airtight, the lungs\nexpand to fill this increased space and air is drawn down the trachea into the lungs (see\ndiagram 9.4a).\n9.7.2 Expiration\nExpiration or breathing out consists of the opposite movements. The ribs move down\nand in and the diaphragm resumes its domed shape so the air is expelled (see diagram\n9.4b). Expiration is usually passive and no energy is required (unless you are blowing up a\nballoon).\n115 Respiratory System\n9.7.3 Lung Volumes\nFigure 92 Diagram 9.5 : Lung volumes\nAsyousitherereadingthisjustpayattentiontoyourbreathing. Noticethatyourinandout\nbreaths are really quite small and gentle (unless you have just rushed here from somewhere\nelse!). Only a small amount of the total volume that your lungs hold is breathed in and\nout with each breath. This kind of gentle \u201cat rest\u201d breathing is called tidal breathing\nand the volume breathed in or out (they should be the same) is the tidal volume (see\ndiagram 9.5). Sometimes people want to measure the volume of air inspired or expired\nduring a minute of this normal breathing. This is called the minute volume . It could be\nestimated by measuring the volume of one tidal breath and then multiplying that by the\nnumber of breaths in a minute. Of course it is possible to take a deep breath and breathe\nin as far as you can and then expire as far as possible. The volume of the air expired when\na maximum expiration follows a maximum inspiration is called the vital capacity (see\ndiagram 9.5).\n9.7.4 Composition Of Air\nThe air animals breathe in consists of 21% oxygen and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Expelled air\nconsists of 16% oxygen and 4.4% carbon dioxide. This means that the lungs remove only\na quarter of the oxygen contained in the air. This is why it is possible to give someone (or\nan animal) artificial respiration by blowing expired air into their mouth.\nBreathing is usually an unconscious activity that takes place whether you are awake or\nasleep, although, humans at least, can also control it consciously. Two regions in the\nhindbrain called the medulla oblongata and pons control the rate of breathing. These\nare called respiratory centres . They respond to the concentration of carbon dioxide\n116 Summary\nin the blood. When this concentration rises during a bout of activity, for example, nerve\nimpulses are automatically sent to the diaphragm and rib muscles that increase the rate\nand the depth of breathing. Increasing the rate of breathing also increases the amount of\noxygen in the blood to meet the needs of this increased activity.\n9.7.5 The Acidity Of The Blood And Breathing\nThedegreeofacidityoftheblood(theacid-basebalance)iscriticalfornormalfunctioning\nof cells and the body as a whole. For example, blood that is too acidic or alkaline can\nseriously affect nerve function causing a coma, muscle spasms, convulsions and even death.\nCarbondioxidecarriedinthebloodmakesthebloodacidicandthehighertheconcentration\nof carbon dioxide the more acidic it is. This is obviously dangerous so there are various\nmechanisms in the body that bring the acid-base balance back within the normal range.\nBreathing is one of these homeostatic mechanisms. By increasing the rate of breathing the\nanimal increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide that is expelled from the blood.\nThis reduces the acidity of the blood.\n9.7.6 Breathing In Birds\nBirds have a unique respiratory system that enables them to respire at the very high rates\nnecessary for flight. The lungs are relatively solid structures that do not change shape and\nsize in the same way as mammalian lungs do. Tubes run through them and connect with\na series of air sacs situated in the thoracic and abdominal body cavities and some of the\nbones. Movements of the ribs and breastbone or sternum expand and compress these air\nsacs so they act rather like bellows and pump air through the lungs. The evolution of this\nextremely efficient system of breathing has enabled birds to migrate vast distances and fly\nat altitudes higher than the summit of Everest.\n9.8 Summary\n\u2022 Animals need to breathe to supply the cells with oxygen and remove the waste product\ncarbon dioxide .\n\u2022 The lungs are situated in the pleural cavities of the thorax .\n\u2022 Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli of the lungs that provide a large surface area. Here\noxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the red blood cells in the capillaries that surround\nthe alveoli. Carbon dioxide, at high concentration in the blood, diffuses into the alveoli\nto be breathed out.\n\u2022 Inspiration occurs when muscle contraction causes the ribs to move up and out and the\ndiaphragm to flatten. These movements increase the volume of the pleural cavity and\ndraw air down the respiratory system into the lungs.\n\u2022 Theairentersthenasalcavityandpassestothepharynxandlarynxwheretheepiglot-\ntis closes the opening to the lungs during swallowing. the air passes down the trachea\nkept open by rings of cartilage to the bronchi and bronchioles and then to the alveoli.\n\u2022 Expiration is a passive process requiring no energy as it relies on the relaxation of the\nmuscles and recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs.\n117 Respiratory System\n\u2022 The rate of breathing is determined by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood.\nAs carbon dioxide makes blood acidic, the rate of breathing helps control the acid/base\nbalance of the blood.\n\u2022 The cells lining the respiratory passages produce mucus which traps dust particles, which\nare wafted into the nose by cilia.\n9.9 Worksheet\nWork through the Respiratory System Worksheet1 to learn the main structures of the\nrespiratory system and how they contribute to inspiration and gas exchange.\n9.10 Test Yourself\nThen use the Test Yourself below to see how much you remember and understand.\n1.

Lymphisaclearwateryfluidthatisverysimilar\ntobloodplasmaexceptthatitcontainslargenumbersofwhitebloodcells, mostlylympho-\ncytes . It also contains protein, cellular debris, foreign particles and bacteria. Lymph that\ncomes from the intestines also contains many fat globules following the absorption of fat\nfrom the digested food into the lymphatics (lacteals ) of the villi (see chapter 11 for more\non these). From the lymph capillaries the lymph flows into larger tubes called lymphatic\nvessels. These carry the lymph back to join the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.1 and\n10.2).\nFigure 94\nDiagram 10.1 - A capillary bed with lymphatic capillaries\n121 Lymphatic System\n10.2.1 Lymphatic vessels\nLymphatic vessels have several similarities to veins. Both are thin walled and return fluid\nto the right hand side of the heart. The movement of the fluid in both is brought about\nby the contraction of the muscles that surround them and both have valves to prevent\nbackflow. One important difference is that lymph passes through at least one lymph node\nor gland before it reaches the blood system (see diagram 10.2). These filter out used cell\nparts, cancer cells and bacteria and help defend the body from infection.\nLymph nodes are of various sizes and shapes and found throughout the body and the\nmore important ones are shown in diagram 10.3. They consist of lymph tissue surrounded\nby a fibrous sheath. Lymph flows into them through a number of incoming vessels. It\nthen trickles through small channels where white cells called macrophages (derived from\nmonocytes ) remove the bacteria and debris by engulfing and digesting them (see diagram\n10.4). The lymph then leaves the lymph nodes through outgoing vessels to continue its\njourney towards the heart where it rejoins the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.2 and\n10.3).\nFigure 95\nDiagram 10.2 - The lymphatic system\nFigure 96\nDiagram 10.3 - The circulation of lymph with major lymph nodes\n122 Lymphatic System\nFigure 97\nDiagram 10.4 - A lymph node\nAswellasfilteringthelymph, lymphnodesproducethewhitecellsknownaslymphocytes\n. Lymphocytes are also produced by the thymus , spleen and bone marrow . There are\ntwo kinds of lymphocyte. The first attach invading micro organisms directly while others\nproduce antibodies that circulate in the blood and attack them.\nThe function of the lymphatic system can therefore be summarized as transport and de-\nfense. It is important for returning the fluid and proteins that have escaped from the blood\ncapillaries to the blood system and is also responsible for picking up the products of fat\ndigestioninthesmallintestine. Itsotheressentialfunctionisaspartoftheimmunesystem,\ndefending the body against infection.\n10.2.2 Problems with lymph nodes and the lymphatic system\nDuring infection of the body the lymph nodes often become swollen and tender because\nof their increased activity. This is what causes the swollen \u2018glands\u2019 in your neck during\nthroat infections, mumps and tonsillitis. Sometimes the bacteria multiply in the lymph\nnode and cause inflammation. Cancer cells may also be carried to the lymph nodes and\nthen transported to other parts of the body where they may multiply to form a secondary\ngrowth or metastasis . The lymphatic system may therefore contribute to the spread of\ncancer. Inactivity of the muscles surrounding the lymphatic vessels or blockage of these\nvessels causes tissue fluid to \u2018back up\u2019 in the tissues resulting in swelling or oedema .\n123 Lymphatic System\n10.3 Other Organs Of The Lymphatic System\nThe spleen is an important part of the lymphatic system. It is a deep red organ situated\nin the abdomen caudal to the stomach (see diagram 10.3). It is composed of two different\ntypes of tissue. The first type makes and stores lymphocytes, the cells of the immune\nsystem. The second type of tissue destroys worn out red blood cells, breaking down the\nhaemoglobin into iron, which is recycled, and waste products that are excreted. The spleen\nalso stores red blood cells. When severe blood loss occurs, it contracts and releases them\ninto the circulation.\nThe thymus is a large pink organ lying just under the sternum (breastbone) just cranial\nto the heart (see diagram 10.1). It has an important function processing lymphocytes so\nthey are capable of recognising and attacking foreign invaders like bacteria.\nOther lymph organs are the bone marrow of the long bones where lymphocytes are pro-\nduced and lymph nodules , which are like tiny lymph nodes. Large clusters of these are\nfound in the wall of the small intestine (called Peyer\u2019s Patches) and in the tonsils.\n10.4 Summary\n\u2022 Fluid leaks out of the thin walled capillaries as they pass through the tissues. This is\ncalled tissue fluid .\n\u2022 Much of tissue fluid passes back into the capillaries. Some enters the blind-ended lym-\nphatic capillaries that form a network between the cells of the tissues. This fluid is called\nlymph .\n\u2022 Lymph flows from the lymphatic capillaries to lymph vessels , passing through\nlymph nodes and along the thoracic duct to join the blood system.\n\u2022 Lymph nodes filter the lymph and produce lymphocytes .\n\u2022 Other organs of the lymphatic system are the spleen, thymus, bone marrow , and\nlymph nodules .\n10.5 Worksheets\nLymphatic System Worksheet1\n10.6 Test Yourself\n1.

This process is called\nphotosynthesis. Animalsrelyontheseready-madeorganicmoleculestosupplythemwith\ntheir food. Some animals (herbivores) eat plants; some (carnivores) eat the herbivores.\n11.3 Herbivores\nHerbivoreseat plant material. While no animal produces the digestive enzymes to break\ndown the large cellulose molecules in the plant cell walls, micro-organisms\u2019 like bacteria,\non the other hand, can break them down. Therefore herbivores employ micro-organisms to\ndo the job for them.\nThere are three types of herbivore:\nThe first, ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats, house these bacteria in a special com-\npartment in the enlarged stomach called the rumen .\nThesecondgrouphasanenlargedlargeintestineandcaecum,calledafunctional caecum\n, occupied\nby cellulose digesting micro-organisms. These non-ruminant herbivores include the horse,\nrabbit and rat.\nHumansalsohaveacecumandcanbeclassifiedasthethirdtypeofherbivorousclass, along\nwith orangutans and gorillas.\nPlants are a primary pure and good source of nutrients, however they are digested very\neasilyandthereforeherbivoreshavetoeatlargequantitiesoffoodtoobtainalltheyrequire.\nHerbivores like cows, horses and rabbits typically spend much of their day feeding. To give\nthemicro-organismsaccesstothecellulosemolecules, theplantcellwallsneedtobebroken\ndown. This is why herbivores have teeth that are adapted to crush and grind. Their guts\nalso tend to be lengthy and the food takes a long time to pass through it.\nEating plants have other advantages. Plants are immobile so herbivores normally have to\nspend little energy collecting them. This contrasts with another main group of animals -\nthe carnivores that often have to chase their prey.\n128 Carnivores\n11.4 Carnivores\nCarnivorous animals like those in the cat and dog families, polar bears, seals, crocodiles\nand birds of prey catch and eat other animals. They often have to use large amounts of\nenergy finding, stalking, catching and killing their prey. However, they are rewarded by\nthe fact that meat provides a very concentrated source of nutrients. Carnivores in the wild\ntherefore tend to eat distinct meals often with long and irregular intervals between them.\nTime after feeding is spent digesting and absorbing the food.\nThe guts of carnivores are usually shorter and less complex than those of herbivores be-\ncause meat is easier to digest than plant material. Carnivores usually have teeth that are\nspecialised for dealing with flesh, gristle and bone. They have sleek bodies, strong, sharp\nclaws and keen senses of smell, hearing and sight. They are also often cunning, alert and\nhave an aggressive nature.\n11.5 Omnivores\nMany animals feed on both animal and vegetable material \u2013 they are omnivorous. Most\nprimates, including humans, are herbivorous but a few, such as chimpanzees belong to this\ncategory as do pigs and rats. Their food is diverse, ranging from plant material to animals\nthey have either killed themselves or scavenged from other carnivores. Omnivores lack the\nspecialised teeth and guts of carnivores and herbivores but are often highly intelligent and\nadaptable reflecting their varied diet.\n11.6 Treatment Of Food\nWhether an animal eats plants or flesh, the carbohydrates , fats and proteins in the\nfood it eats are generally giant molecules (see chapter 1). These need to be split up into\nsmaller ones before they can pass into the blood and enter the cells to be used for energy\nor to make new cell constituents.\nFor example:\nCarbohydrates like cellulose, starch, and glycogen need to be split into glucose and\nother monosaccharides ;\nProteins need to be split into amino acids ;\nFats or lipids need to be split into fatty acids and glycerol .\n11.7 The Gut\nThedigestive tract, alimentary canalorgutisahollowtubestretchingfromthemouth\nto the anus. It is the organ system concerned with the treatment of foods.\n129 The Gut and Digestion\nAt the mouth the large food molecules are taken into the gut - this is called ingestion .\nTheymustthenbebrokendownintosmalleronesbydigestiveenzymes-digestion, before\nthey can be taken from the gut into the blood stream - absorption . The cells of the body\ncan then use these small molecules - assimilation . The indigestible waste products are\neliminated from the body by the act of egestion (see diagram 11.1).\nFigure 99\nDiagram 11.1 - From ingestion to egestion\nThe 4 major functions of the gut are:\n1. Transporting the food;\n2. Processing the food physically by breaking it up (chewing), mixing, adding fluid etc.\n3. Processingthefoodchemicallybyaddingdigestiveenzymestosplitlargefoodmolecules\ninto smaller ones.\n4. Absorbing these small molecules into the blood stream so the body can use them.\nThe regions of a typical mammals gut (for example a cat or dog) are shown in diagram\n11.2.\n130 The Gut\nFigure 100\nDiagram 11.2 - A typical mammalian gut\nThe food that enters the mouth passes to the oesophagus , then to the stomach , small\nintestine , cecum , large intestine , rectum and finally undigested material exits at\nthe anus . The liver and pancreas produce secretions that aid digestion and the gall\nbladder stores bile . Herbivores have an appendix which they use for the digestion of\ncellulose. Carnivores have an appendix but is not of any function anymore due to the fact\nthat their diet is not based on cellulose anymore.\n131 The Gut and Digestion\n11.8 Mouth\nThe mouth takes food into the body. The lips hold the food inside the mouth during\nchewing and allow the baby animal to suck on its mother\u2019s teat. In elephants the lips (and\nnose)havedevelopedintothe trunk whichis the mainfood collecting tool. Somemammals,\ne.g. hamsters, have stretchy cheek pouches that they use to carry food or material to make\ntheir nests.\nThe sight or smell of food and its presence in the mouth stimulates the salivary glands\nto secrete saliva . There are four pairs of these glands in cats and dogs (see diagram 11.3).\nThe fluid they produce moistens and softens the food making it easier to swallow. It also\ncontains the enzyme, salivary amylase , which starts the digestion of starch.\nThe tongue moves food around the mouth and rolls it into a ball for swallowing. Taste\nbuds are located on the tongue and in dogs and cats it is covered with spiny projections\nused for grooming and lapping. The cow\u2019s tongue is prehensile and wraps around grass to\ngraze it.\nSwallowing is a complex reflex involving 25 different muscles. It pushes food into the\noesophagus and at the same time a small flap of tissue called the epiglottis closes off the\nwindpipesofooddoesn\u2019tgo\u2018downthewrongway\u2019andchoketheanimal(seediagram11.4).\nFigure 101\nDiagram 11.3 - Salivary glands\n132 Teeth\nFigure 102\nDiagram 11.4 - Section through the head of a dog\n11.9 Teeth\nTeeth seize, tear and grind food. They are inserted into sockets in the bone and consist of\na crown above the gum and root below. The crown is covered with a layer of enamel , the\nhardest substance in the body. Below this is the dentine , a softer but tough and shock\nresistant material. At the centre of the tooth is a space filled with pulp which contains\nblood vessels and nerves. The tooth is cemented into the socket and in most teeth the\ntip of the root is quite narrow with a small opening for the blood vessels and nerves (see\ndiagram 11.5).\nIn teeth that grow continuously, like the incisors of rodents, the opening remains large and\nthese teeth are called open rooted teeth . Mammals have 2 distinct sets of teeth. The\nfirst the milk teeth are replaced by the permanent teeth .\n133 The Gut and Digestion\nFigure 103\nDiagram 11.5 - Structure of a tooth\n11.9.1 Types Of Teeth\nAll the teeth of fish and reptiles are similar but mammals usually have four different types\nof teeth.\nThe incisors are the chisel-shaped \u2018biting off\u2019 teeth at the front of the mouth. In rodents\nand rabbits the incisors never stop growing (open-rooted teeth). They must be worn or\nground down continuously by gnawing. They have hard enamel on one surface only so they\nwear unevenly and maintain their sharp cutting edge.\nThe largest incisors in the animal kingdom are found in elephants, for tusks are actually\ngiant incisors. Sloths have no incisors at all, and sheep have no incisors in the upper jaw\n(see diagram 11.6). Instead there is a horny pad against which the bottom incisors cut.\nThe canines or \u2018wolf-teeth\u2019 are long, cone-shaped teeth situated just behind the incisors.\nThey are particularly well developed in the dog and cat families where they are used to\nhold, stab and kill the prey (see diagram 11.7).\nThe tusks of boars and walruses are large canines while rodents and herbivores like sheep\nhave no (or reduced) canines. In these animals the space where the canines would normally\nbe is called the diastema . In rodents like the rat and beaver it allows the debris from\ngnawing to be expelled easily.\n134 Teeth\nThecheekteethorpremolarsandmolarscrushandgrindthefood. Theyareparticularly\nwell developed in herbivores where they have complex ridges that form broad grinding\nsurfaces (see diagram 11.6). These are created from alternating bands of hard enamel and\nsofter dentine that wear at different rates.\nIn carnivores the premolars and molars slice against each other like scissors and are called\ncarnassial teeth see diagram 11.7). They are used for shearing flesh and bone.\n11.9.2 Dental Formula\nThe numbers of the different kinds of teeth can be expressed in a dental formula . This\ngives the numbers of incisors, canines, premolars and molars in one half of the mouth. The\nnumbers of these four types of teeth in the left or right half of the upper jaw are written\nabove a horizontal line and the four types of teeth in the right or left half of the lower\njaw are written below it.\nThus the dental formula for the sheep is:\n0.0.3.3\n3.1.3.3\nIt indicates that in the upper right (or left) half of the jaw there are no incisors or canines\n(i.e. there is a diastema ), three premolars and three molars. In the lower right (or left)\nhalfofthejawarethreeincisors,onecanine,threepremolarsandthreemolars(seediagram\n11.6).\n135 The Gut and Digestion\nFigure 104\nDiagram 11.6 - A sheep\u2019s skull\nThe dental formula for a dog is:\n3.1.4.2\n3.1.4.3\nTheformulaindicatesthatintheright(orleft)halfoftheupperjawtherearethreeincisors,\none canine, four premolars and two molars. In the right (or left) half of the lower jaw there\nare three incisors, one canine, four premolars and three molars (see diagram 11.7).\n136 Oesophagus\nFigure 105\nDiagram 11.7 - A dog\u2019s skull\n11.10 Oesophagus\nThe oesophagus transports food to the stomach. Food is moved along the oesophagus,\nas it is along the small and large intestines, by contraction of the smooth muscles in the\nwalls that push the food along rather like toothpaste along a tube. This movement is called\nperistalsis (see diagram 11.8).\nFigure 106\nDiagram 11.8 - Peristalsis\n137 The Gut and Digestion\n11.11 Stomach\nThe stomach stores and mixes the food. Glands in the wall secrete gastric juice that\ncontains enzymes to digest protein and fats as well as hydrochloric acid to make the\ncontents very acidic. The walls of the stomach are very muscular and churn and mix the\nfood with the gastric juice to form a watery mixture called chyme (pronounced kime).\nRings of muscle called sphincters at the entrance and exit to the stomach control the\nmovement of food into and out of it (see diagram 11.9).\nFigure 107\nDiagram 11.9 - The stomach\n11.12 Small Intestine\nMost of the breakdown of the large food molecules and absorption of the smaller molecules\ntake place in the long and narrow small intestine. The total length varies but it is about\n6.5 metres in humans, 21 metres in the horse, 40 metres in the ox and over 150 metres in\nthe blue whale.\nIt is divided into 3 sections: the duodenum (after the stomach), jejunum and ileum. The\nduodenum receives 3 different secretions:\n1) Bile from the liver;\n2) Pancreatic juice from the pancreas and\n3) Intestinal juice from glands in the intestinal wall.\n138 The Rumen\nThese complete the digestion of starch, fats and protein. The products of digestion are\nabsorbed into the blood and lymphatic system through the wall of the intestine, which is\nlined with tiny finger-like projections called villi that increase the surface area for more\nefficient absorption (see diagram 11.10).\nFigure 108\nDiagram 11.10 - The wall of the small intestine showing villi\n11.13 The Rumen\nIn ruminant herbivores like cows, sheep and antelopes the stomach is highly modified to\nact as a \u201cfermentation vat\u201d. It is divided into four parts. The largest part is called the\nrumen . In the cow it occupies the entire left half of the abdominal cavity and can hold\nup to 270 litres. The reticulum is much smaller and has a honeycomb of raised folds on\nits inner surface. In the camel the reticulum is further modified to store water. The next\npart is called the omasum with a folded inner surface. Camels have no omasum. The final\ncompartment is called the abomasum . This is the \u2018true\u2019 stomach where muscular walls\nchurn the food and gastric juice is secreted (see diagram 11.11).\n139 The Gut and Digestion\nFigure 109\nDiagram 11.11 - The rumen\nRuminants swallow the grass they graze almost without chewing and it passes down the\noesophagus to the rumen and reticulum. Here liquid is added and the muscular walls churn\nthe food. These chambers provide the main fermentation vat of the ruminant stomach.\nHere bacteria and single-celled animals start to act on the cellulose plant cell walls. These\norganismsbreakdownthecellulosetosmallermoleculesthatareabsorbedtoprovidethecow\nor sheep with energy. In the process, the gases methane and carbon dioxide are produced.\nThese cause the \u201cburps\u201d you may hear cows and sheep making.\nNot only do the micro-organisms break down the cellulose but they also produce the vita-\nmins E, B and K for use by the animal. Their digested bodies provide the ruminant with\nthe majority of its protein requirements.\nIn the wild grazing is a dangerous activity as it exposes the herbivore to predators. They\ncrop the grass as quickly as possible and then when the animal is in a safer place the food\nin the rumen can be regurgitated to be chewed at the animal\u2019s leisure. This is \u2018chewing the\ncud\u2019 or rumination . The finely ground food may be returned to the rumen for further\nwork by the microorganisms or, if the particles are small enough, it will pass down a special\ngroove in the wall of the oesophagus straight into the omasum. Here the contents are\nkneaded and water is absorbed before they pass to the abomasum. The abomasum acts as\na \u201cproper\u201d stomach and gastric juice is secreted to digest the protein.\n11.14 Large Intestine\nThe large intestine consists of the caecum , colon and rectum . The chyme from the\nsmall intestine that enters the colon consists mainly of water and undigested material such\nas cellulose (fibre or roughage). In omnivores like the pig and humans the main function of\n140 Functional Caecum\nthe colon is absorption of water to give solid faeces. Bacteria in this part of the gut produce\nvitamins B and K.\nThe caecum, which forms a dead-end pouch where the small intestine joins the large intes-\ntine, is small in pigs and humans and helps water absorption. However, in rabbits, rodents\nand horses, the caecum is very large and called the functional caecum . It is here that\ncellulose is digested by micro-organisms. The appendix , a narrow dead end tube at the\nend of the caecum, is particularly large in primates but seems to have no digestive function.\n11.15 Functional Caecum\nThe caecum in the rabbit, rat and guinea pig is greatly enlarged to provide a \u201cfermentation\nvat\u201d for micro-organisms to break down the cellulose plant cell walls. This is called a\nfunctional caecum (see diagram 11.12). In the horse both the caecum and the colon\nare enlarged. As in the rumen, the large cellulose molecules are broken down to smaller\nmolecules that can be absorbed. However, the position of the functional caecum after the\nmainareasofdigestionandabsorption, meansitispotentiallylesseffectivethantherumen.\nThis means that the small molecules that are produced there can not be absorbed by the\ngut but pass out in the faeces. The rabbit and rodents (and foals) solve this problem by\neating their own faeces so that they pass through the gut a second time and the products\nof cellulose digestion can be absorbed in the small intestine. Rabbits produce two kinds of\nfaeces. Softer night-time faeces are eaten directly from the anus and the harder pellets you\nare probably familiar with, that have passed through the gut twice.\nFigure 110\n141 The Gut and Digestion\nDiagram 11.12 - The gut of a rabbit\n11.16 The Gut Of Birds\nBirds\u2019 guts have important differences from mammals\u2019 guts. Most obviously, birds have a\nbeak instead of teeth. Beaks are much lighter than teeth and are an adaptation for flight.\nImagine a bird trying to take off and fly with a whole set of teeth in its head! At the base of\ntheoesophagus birdshaveabag-likestructurecalled a crop . In manybirdsthecropstores\nfood before it enters the stomach, while in pigeons and doves glands in the crop secretes\na special fluid called crop-milk which parent birds regurgitate to feed their young. The\nstomach is also modified and consists of two compartments. The first is the true stomach\nwith muscular walls and enzyme secreting glands. The second compartment is the gizzard\n. In seed eating birds this has very muscular walls and contains pebbles swallowed by the\nbird to help grind the food. This is the reason why you must always supply a caged bird\nwith grit. In birds of prey like the falcon the walls of the gizzard are much thinner and\nexpand to accommodate large meals (see diagram 11.13).\nFigure 111\nDiagram 11.13 - The stomach and small intestine of a hen\n11.17 Digestion\nDuring digestion the large food molecules are broken down into smaller molecules by en-\nzymes . The three most important groups of enzymes secreted into the gut are:\n1. Amylases that split carbohydrates like starch and glycogen into monosaccharides\nlike glucose.\n142 Pancreatic juice\n2. Proteases that split proteins into amino acids.\n3. Lipases that split lipids or fats into fatty acids and glycerol.\nGlands produce various secretions which mix with the food as it passes along the gut.\nThese secretions include:\n1. Saliva secreted into the mouth from several pairs of salivary glands (see diagram\n11.3). Saliva consists mainly of water but contains salts, mucous and salivary amy-\nlase. The function of saliva is to lubricate food as it is chewed and swallowed and\nsalivary amylase begins the digestion of starch.\n2. Gastric juice secreted into the stomach from glands in its walls. Gastric juice\ncontains pepsin that breaks down protein and hydrochloric acid to produce the\nacidic conditions under which this enzyme works best. In baby animals rennin to\ndigest milk is also produced in the stomach.\n3. Bile produced by the liver. It is stored in the gall bladder and secreted into the\nduodenum via the bile duct (see diagram 11.14). (Note that the horse, deer, parrot\nand rat have no gall bladder). Bile is not a digestive enzyme. Its function is to break\nup large globules of fat into smaller ones so the fat splitting enzymes can gain access\nthe fat molecules.\nFigure 112\nDiagram 11.14 - The liver, gall bladder and pancreas\n11.18 Pancreatic juice\nThe pancreas is a gland located near the beginning of the duodenum (see diagram 11.14).\nIn most animals it is large and easily seen but in rodents and rabbits it lies within the\nmembrane linking the loops of the intestine (the mesentery ) and is quite difficult to find.\nPancreatic juice is produced in the pancreas. It flows into the duodenum and contains\namylase for digesting starch, lipase for digesting fats and protease for digesting proteins.\n143 The Gut and Digestion\n11.19 Intestinal juice\nIntestinal juice is produced by glands in the lining of the small intestine. It contains\nenzymes for digesting disaccharides and proteins as well as mucus and salts to make the\ncontents of the small intestine more alkaline so the enzymes can work.\n11.20 Absorption\nThe small molecules produced by digestion are absorbed into the villi of the wall of the\nsmall intestine . The tiny finger-like projections of the villi increase the surface area for\nabsorption. Glucose and amino acids pass directly through the wall into the blood stream\nby diffusion or active transport. Fatty acids and glycerol enter vessels of the lymphatic\nsystem (lacteals ) that run up the centre of each villus.\n11.21 The Liver\nThe liver is situated in the abdominal cavity adjacent to the diaphragm (see diagrams 2\nand 14). It is the largest single organ of the body and has over 100 known functions. Its\nmost important digestive functions are:\n1. the production of bile to help the digestion of fats (described above) and\n2. the control of blood sugar levels\nGlucose is absorbed into the capillaries of the villi of the intestine. The blood stream takes\nit directly to the liver via a blood vessel known as the hepatic portal vessel or vein (see\ndiagram 11.15).\nThe liver converts this glucose into glycogen which it stores. When glucose levels are low\nthe liver can convert the glycogen back into glucose. It releases this back into the blood to\nkeep the level of glucose constant. The hormone insulin , produced by special cells in the\npancreas , controls this process.\n144 The Liver\nFigure 113\nDiagram 11.15 - The control of blood glucose by the liver\nOther functions of the liver include:\n3. making vitamin A ,\n4. making the proteins that are found in the blood plasma (albumin, globulin and\nfibrinogen ),\n5. storing iron ,\n6. removing toxic substances like alcohol and poisons from the blood and converting\nthem to safer substances,\n7. producing heat to help maintain the temperature of the body.\n145 The Gut and Digestion\nFigure 114\nDiagram 11.16 - Summary of the main functions of the different regions of the gut\n11.22 Summary\n\u2022 The gut breaks down plant and animal materials into nutrients that can be used by\nanimals\u2019 bodies.\n\u2022 Plantmaterialismoredifficulttobreakdownthananimaltissue. Thegutofherbivores\nis therefore longer and more complex than that of carnivores . Herbivores usually have\na compartment (the rumen or functional caecum ) housing micro-organisms to break\ndown the cellulose wall of plants.\n146 Worksheet\n\u2022 Chewing by the teeth begins the food processing. There are 4 main types of teeth:\nincisors, canines, premolars and molars . In dogs and cats the premolars and molars\nare adapted to slice against each other and are called carnassial teeth.\n\u2022 Saliva is secreted in the mouth. It lubricates the food for swallowing and contains an\nenzyme to break down starch.\n\u2022 Chewed food is swallowed and passes down the oesophagus by waves of contraction of\nthe wall called peristalsis. The food passes to the stomach where it is churned and\nmixed with acidic gastric juice that begins the digestion of protein.\n\u2022 The resulting chyme passes down the small intestine where enzymes that digest fats,\nproteins and carbohydrates are secreted. Bile produced by the liver is also secreted here.\nIt helps in the breakdown of fats.

Theprocesses\nthat take place in them are upset if the temperature is too high or too low, or if the fluid\naround or inside them is too acid or alkaline. Homeostasis is the name given to the\nprocesses that help keep the internal conditions constant even when external conditions\nchange. The word means, \u201cstaying the same\u201d.\nThere are a number of organs in the body that play a part in maintaining homeostasis. For\nexample, the skin helps keep the internal temperature of bird and mammals bodies within\na narrow range even when the outside temperatures change (see Chapters 5 and 16); the\nlungs control the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood (see Chapters 8 and 16); the liver\nandpancreasworktogethertokeeptheamountofglucoseinthebloodwithinnarrowlimits\n(see Chapter 5) and the kidneys regulate the acidity and the concentration of water and\nsalt in the blood (also see Chapter 16). How the kidneys do this will be described later in\nthis chapter.\nHormonesarechemicalsthatcarrymessagesaroundthebodyinthebloodandarecentral\ntomanyofthehomeostaticprocessesmentionedabove. Theirrolewillbedescribedinmore\ndetail in Chapter 16.\n12.3 Water In The Body\nWater is essential for living things to survive because all the chemical reactions within a\nbody take place in a solution of water. An animal\u2019s body consists of up to 80% water. The\nexact proportion depends on the type of animal, its age, sex, health and whether or not it\nhas had sufficient to drink. Generally animals do not survive a loss of more than 15% of\ntheir body water.\n150 Maintaining Water Balance\nIn vertebrates almost 2/3rd of this water is in the cells (intracellular fluid ). The rest\nis outside the cells (extracellular fluid ) where it is found in the spaces around the cells\n(tissue fluid ), as well as in the blood and lymph.\nFigure 116\nDiagram 12.1 - Water in the body\n12.4 Maintaining Water Balance\nAnimals lose water through their skin and lungs, in the faeces and urine. These losses\nmust be made up by water in food and drink and from the water that is a by-product of\nchemicalreactions. Iftheanimaldoesnotmanagetocompensateforwaterlossthedissolved\nsubstances in the blood may become so concentrated they become lethal. To prevent this\nhappening various mechanisms come into play as soon as the concentration of the blood\nincreases. A part of the brain called the hypothalamus is in charge of these homeostatic\nprocesses. The most important is the feeling of thirst that is triggered by an increase in\nblood concentration. This stimulates an animal to find water and drink it.\nThe kidneys are also involved in maintaining water balance as various hormones instruct\nthem to produce more concentrated urine and so retain some of the water that would\notherwise be lost (see later in this Chapter and Chapter 16).\n151 Urinary System\n12.4.1 Desert Animals\nCopingwithwaterlossisaparticularproblemforanimalsthatliveindryconditions. Some,\nlike the camel, have developed great tolerance for dehydration. For example, under some\nconditions, camels can withstand the loss of one third of their body mass as water. They\ncan also survive wide daily changes in temperature. This means they do not have to use\nlarge quantities of water in sweat to cool the body by evaporation.\nSmaller animals are more able than large ones to avoid extremes of temperature or dry\nconditions by resting in sheltered more humid situations during the day and being active\nonly at night.\nThe kangaroo rat is able to survive without access to any drinking water at all because it\ndoes not sweat and produces extremely concentrated urine. Water from its food and from\nchemical processes is sufficient to supply all its requirements.\n12.5 Excretion\nAnimals need to excrete because they take in substances that are excess to the body\u2019s\nrequirements and many of the chemical reactions in the body produce waste products. If\nthese substances were not removed they would poison cells or slow down metabolism. All\nanimals therefore have some means of getting rid of these wastes.\nThe major waste products in mammals are carbon dioxide that is removed by the lungs,\nand urea that is produced when excess amino acids (from proteins) are broken down. Urea\nis filtered from the blood by the kidneys.\n152 The Kidneys And Urinary System\nFigure 117\nDiagram 12.2 - The position of the organs of the urinary system in a dog\n12.6 The Kidneys And Urinary System\nThekidneysinmammalsarebean-shapedorgansthatlieintheabdominalcavityattached\nto the dorsal wall on either side of the spine (see diagram 12.2). An artery from the dorsal\naorta called the renal artery supplies blood to them and the renal vein drains them.\n153 Urinary System\nFigure 118\nDiagram 12.3 - The urinary system\nTo the naked eye kidneys seem simple enough organs. They are covered by a fibrous coat\nor capsule and if cut in half lengthways (longitudinally) two distinct regions can be seen -\nan inner region or medulla and the outer cortex . A cavity within the kidney called the\npelvis collects the urine and carries it to the ureter , which connects with the bladder\nwhere the urine is stored temporarily. Rings of muscle (sphincters ) control the release of\nurine from the bladder and the urine leaves the body through the urethra (see diagrams\n12.3 and 12.4).\n154 Kidney Tubules Or Nephrons\nFigure 119\nDiagram 12.4 - The dissected kidney\n12.7 Kidney Tubules Or Nephrons\nItisonlywhenyouexaminekidneysunderthemicroscopethatyoufindthattheirstructure\nisnotsimpleatall.

It surrounds a tuft of capillaries called the glomerulus\nthat carries high-pressure blood. Together the glomerulus and capsule act as a blood-\n156 Kidney Tubules Or Nephrons\nfiltering device (see diagram 12.7). The holes in the filter allow most of the contents of\nthe blood through except the red and white cells and large protein molecules. The fluid\nflowing from the capsule into the rest of the kidney tubule is therefore very similar to blood\nplasma and contains many useful substances like water, glucose, salt and amino acids. It\nalso contains waste products like urea .\n12.7.1 Processes Occurring In The Nephron\nAfter entering the glomerulus the filtered fluid flows along a coiled part of the tubule (the\nproximal convoluted tubule ) to a looped portion (the Loop of Henle ) and then to\nthe collecting tube via a second length of coiled tube (the distal convoluted tubule\n) (see diagram 12.6). From the collecting ducts the urine flows into the renal pelvis and\nenters the ureter .\nNote that the glomerulus, capsule and both coiled parts of the tubule are all situated in\nthe cortex of the kidney while the loops of Henle and collecting ducts make up the medulla\n(see diagram 12.5).\nAsthefluidflowsalongtheproximalconvolutedtubuleusefulsubstanceslikeglucose,water,\nsalts, potassium ions, calcium ions and amino acids are reabsorbed into the blood capil-\nlaries that form a network around the tubules. Many of these substances are transported\nby active transport and energy is required.\nFigure 122\nDiagram 12.7 - Filtration in the glomerulus and capsule\n157 Urinary System\nIn a separate process, some substances, particularly potassium, ammonium and hydrogen\nions, and drugs like penicillin, are actively secreted into the distal convoluted tubule.\nBy the time the fluid has reached the collecting ducts these processes of absorption and\nsecretion have changed the fluid originally filtered into the Bowman\u2019s capsule into urine.\nThe main function of the collecting ducts is then to remove more water from the urine if\nnecessary. These processes are summarised in diagram 12.8.\nNormal urine consists of water, in which waste products such as urea and salts such as\nsodium chloride are dissolved. Pigments from the breakdown of red blood cells give urine\nits yellow colour.\n12.7.2 The Production Of Concentrated Urine\nBecauseofthehighpressureofthebloodintheglomerulusandthelargesizeoftheporesin\nthe glomerulus/capsule-filtering device, an enormous volume of fluid passes into the kidney\ntubules. Ifthisfluidwereleftasitis, theanimal\u2019sbodywouldbedraineddryin30minutes.\nIn fact, as the fluid flows down the tubule, over 90% of the water in it is reabsorbed. The\nmain part of this reabsorption takes place in the collecting tubes.\nThe amount of water removed from the collecting ducts is controlled by a hormone called\nantidiuretic hormone (ADH) produced by the pituitary gland , situated at the base\nof the brain. When the blood becomes more concentrated, as happens when an animal is\ndeprivedofwater,ADHissecretedandcausesmorewatertobeabsorbedfromthecollecting\nducts so that concentrated urine is produced. When the animal has drunk plenty of water\nand the blood is dilute, no ADH is secreted and no or little water is absorbed from the\ncollecting ducts, so dilute urine is produced. In this way the concentration of the blood is\ncontrolled precisely.\n158 Water Balance In Fish And Marine Animals\nFigure 123\nDiagram 12.8 - Summary of the processes involved in the formation of urine\n12.8 Water Balance In Fish And Marine Animals\n12.8.1 Fresh Water Fish\nAlthough the skin of fish is more or less waterproof, the gills are very porous. The body\nfluids of fish that live in fresh water have a higher concentration of dissolved substances\nthan the water in which they swim. In other words the body fluids of fresh water fish are\nhypertonic to the water (see chapter 3). Water therefore flows into the body by osmosis\n. To stop the body fluids being constantly diluted fresh water fish produce large quantities\nof dilute urine.\n12.8.2 Marine Fish\nMarine fish like the sharks and dogfish have body fluids that have the same concentration\nof dissolved substances as the water (isotonic ) have little problem with water balance.\nHowever, marine bony fish like red cod, snapper and sole, have body fluids with a lower\n159 Urinary System\nconcentrationofdissolvedsubstancesthanseawater(theyarehypotonictoseawater). This\nmeans that water tends to flow out of their bodies by osmosis. To make up this fluid loss\nthey drink seawater and get rid of the excess salt by excreting it from the gills.\n12.8.3 Marine Birds\nMarine birds that eat marine fish take in large quantities of salt and some only have access\nto seawater for drinking. Bird\u2019s kidneys are unable to produce very concentrated urine, so\nthey have developed a salt gland. This excretes a concentrated salt solution into the nose\nto get rid of the excess salt.\n12.9 Diabetes And The Kidney\nThere are two types of diabetes. The most common is called sugar diabetes or diabetes\nmellitus and is common in cats and dogs especially if they are overweight. It is caused\nby the pancreas secreting insufficient insulin , the hormone that controls the amount of\nglucose in the blood. If insulin secretion is inadequate, the concentration of glucose in the\nblood increases. Any increase in the glucose in the blood automatically leads to an increase\nin glucose in the fluid filtered into the kidney tubule. Normally the kidney removes all the\nglucose filtered into it, but these high concentrations swamp this removal mechanism and\nurine containing glucose is produced. The main symptoms of this type of diabetes are the\nproduction of large amounts of dilute urine containing glucose, and excessive thirst.\nThe second type of diabetes is called diabetes insipidus . The name comes from the main\nsymptom, which is the production of large amounts of very dilute and \u201ctasteless\u201d urine. It\noccurs when the pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, the hormone that stimulates\nwater re-absorption from the kidney tubule. When this hormone is lacking, water is not\nabsorbed and large amounts of dilute urine are produced. Because so much water is lost in\nthe urine, animals with this form of diabetes can die if deprived of water for only a day or\nso.\n12.10 Other Functions Of The Kidney\nThe excretion of urea from the body and the maintenance of water balance, as described\nabove, are the main functions of the kidney. However, the kidneys have other roles in\nkeeping conditions in the body stable i.e. in maintaining homeostasis. These include:\n\u2022 controlling the concentration of salt ions (Na+, K+, Cl-) in the blood by adjusting how\nmuch is excreted or retained;\n\u2022 maintaining the correct acidity of the blood. Excess acid is constantly being produced\nby the normal chemical reactions in the body and the kidney eliminates this.\n160 Normal Urine\n12.11 Normal Urine\nNormal urine consists of water (95%), urea, salts (mostly sodium chloride) and pigments\n(mostly from bile) that give it its characteristic colour.\n12.12 Abnormal Ingredients Of Urine\nIf the body is not working properly, small amounts of substances not normally present may\nbe found in the urine or substances normally present may appear in abnormal amounts.\n\u2022 The presence of glucose may indicate diabetes (see above).\n\u2022 Urine with red blood cells in it is called haematuria , and may indicate inflammation\nof the kidney,or urinary tract, cancer or a blow to the kidneys.\n\u2022 Sometimes free haemoglobin is found in the urine. This indicates that the red\nblood cells in the blood have haemolysed (the membrane has broken down) and the\nhaemoglobin has passed into the kidney tubules.\n\u2022 The presence of white blood cells in the urine indicates there is an infection in the\nkidney or urinary tract.\n\u2022 Protein molecules are usually too large to pass into the kidney tubule so no or only\nsmall amounts of proteins like albumin is normally found in urine. Large quantities of\nalbumin indicate that the kidney tubules have been injured or the kidney has become\ndiseased. High blood pressure also pushes proteins from the blood into the tubules.\n\u2022 Casts are tiny cylinders of material that have been shed from the lining of the tubules\nand flushed out into the urine.\n\u2022 Mucus is not usually found in the urine of healthy animals but is a normal constituent\nof horses\u2019 urine, giving it a characteristic cloudy appearance.\nTests can be carried out to identify any abnormal ingredients of urine. These tests are\nnormally done by \u201cstix \u201d, which are small plastic strips with absorbent ends impregnated\nwith various chemicals. A colour change occurs in the presence of an abnormal ingredient.\n12.13 Excretion In Birds\nBirds\u2019 high body temperature and level of activity means that they need to conserve water.\nBirds therefore do not have a bladder and instead of excreting urea, which needs to be\ndissolved in large amounts of water, birds produce uric acid that can be discharged as a\nthick paste along with the feces. This is the white chalky part of the bird droppings that\nland on you or your car.\n12.14 Summary\n\u2022 The excretory system consists of paired kidneys and associated blood supply. Ureters\ntransporturinefromthekidneystothebladderandtheurethrawithassociatedsphincter\nmuscles controls the release of urine.\n161 Urinary System\n\u2022 The kidneys have an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. They\nexcrete the waste product urea, control the concentrations of water and salt in the body\nfluids, and regulate the acidity of the blood.\n\u2022 A kidney consists of an outer region or cortex, inner medulla and a cavity called the\npelvis that collects the urine and carries it to the ureter.\n\u2022 The tissue of a kidney is composed of masses of tiny tubes called kidney tubules or\nnephrons . These are the structures that make the urine.\n\u2022 High-pressurebloodissuppliedtothenephronviaatuftofcapillariescalledtheglomeru-\nlus .

The fluid flows to a looped portion of the tubule\ncalled the Loop of Henle where water is reabsorbed and then to another coiled part of\nthe tubule (distal convoluted tubule ) where more reabsorbtion and secretion takes\nplace. Finally the fluid passes down the collecting duct where water is reabsorbed to\nform concentrated urine.\n12.15 Worksheet\nUse this Excretory System Worksheet1 to help you learn the parts of the urinary system,\nthe kidney and kidney tubule and their functions.\n12.16 Test Yourself\nThe Urinary System Test Yourself can then be used to see if you understand this rather\ncomplex system.\n1.

Each gamete is formed by meiosis (see Chapter 3). This\nmeans each contains only half the chromosomes of the body cells (haploid ). Fertilization\nresults in the joining of the male and female gametes to form a zygote which contains the\nfull number of chromosomes (diploid ). The zygote then starts to divide by mitosis (see\nChapter 3) to form a new animal with all its body cells containing chromosomes that are\nidentical to those of the original zygote (see diagram 13.1).\nDiagram 13.1 - Sexual reproduction\nThe offspring formed by sexual reproduction contain genes from both parents and show\nconsiderable variation. For example, kittens in a litter are all different although they (usu-\nally) have the same mother and father. In the wild this variation is important because\nit means that when the environment changes some individuals may be better adapted to\nsurvive than others. These survivors pass their \u201csuperior\u201d genes on to their offspring. In\nthis way the characteristics of a group of animals can gradually change over time to keep\npace with the changing environment. This \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d or \u201cnatural selection \u201d\nis the mechanism behind the theory of evolution .\n13.3 Fertilization\nIn most fish and amphibia (frogs and toads) fertilisation of the egg cells takes place outside\nthe body. The female lays the eggs and then the male deposits his sperm on or at least\nnear them.\n168 Sexual Reproduction In Mammals\nIn reptiles and birds, eggs are fertilized inside the body when the male deposits the sperm\ninside the egg duct of the female. The egg is then surrounded by a resistant shell, \u201claid\u201d\nby the female and the embryo completes its development inside the egg.\nIn mammals the sperm are placed in the body of the female and the eggs are fertilized\ninternally. They then develop to quite an advanced stage inside the body of the female.\nWhen they are born they are fed on milk excreted from the mammary glands and protected\nby their parents until they become independent.\n13.4 Sexual Reproduction In Mammals\nThe reproductive organs of mammals produce the gametes (sperm and egg cells), help\nthem fertilize and then support the developing embryo.\n13.5 The Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes that produce sperm\n(orspermatozoa ), ducts that transport the sperm to the penis and glands that add secre-\ntions to the sperm to make semen (see diagram 13.2).\nThe various parts of the male reproductive system with a summary of their functions are\nshown in diagram 13.3.\n169 Reproductive System\nFigure 126\nDiagram 13.2. The reproductive organs of a male dog\nFigure 127\nDiagram 13.3 - Diagram summarizing the functions of the male reproductive organs\n13.5.1 The Testes\nSperm need temperatures between 2 to 10 degrees Centigrade lower and then the body\ntemperature to develop. This is the reason why the testes are located in a bag of skin called\nthe scrotal sacs (or scrotum ) that hangs below the body and where the evaporation\nof secretions from special glands can further reduce the temperature. In many animals\n(includinghumans)thetestesdescendintothescrotalsacsatbirthbutinsomeanimalsthey\ndo not descend until sexual maturity and in others they only descend temporarily during\nthe breeding season. A mature animal in which one or both testes have not descended is\ncalled a cryptorchid and is usually infertile.\n170 The Male Reproductive System\nThe problem of keeping sperm at a low enough temperature is even greater in birds that\nhave a higher body temperature than mammals. For this reason bird\u2019s sperm are usually\nproduced at night when the body temperature is lower and the sperm themselves are more\nresistant to heat.\nThe testes consist of a mass of coiled tubes (the seminiferous orsperm producing\ntubules)inwhichthespermareformedbymeiosis(seediagram13.4). Cellslyingbetween\nthe seminiferous tubules produce the male sex hormone testosterone .\nWhen the sperm are mature they accumulate in the collecting ducts and then pass to the\nepididymis before moving to the sperm duct or vas deferens . The two sperm ducts\njoin the urethra just below the bladder, which passes through the penis and transports\nboth sperm and urine.\nEjaculation discharges the semen from the erect penis. It is brought about by the con-\ntraction of the epididymis, vas deferens, prostate gland and urethra.\nFigure 128\n171 Reproductive System\nDiagram 13.4 - The testis and a magnified seminiferous tubule\n13.5.2 Semen\nSemen consists of 10% sperm and 90% fluid and as sperm pass down the ducts from testis\nto penis, (accessory) glands add various secretion...\n13.5.3 Accessory Glands\nThree different glands may be involved in producing the secretions in which sperm are\nsuspended, although the number and type of glands varies from species to species.\nSeminal vesicles are important in rats, bulls, boars and stallions but are absent in cats\nand dogs. When present they produce secretions that make up much of the volume of the\nsemen, and transport and provide nutrients for the sperm.\nThe prostate gland is important in dogs and humans. It produces an alkaline secretion\nthat neutralizes the acidity of the male urethra and female vagina.\nCowper\u2019s glands (bulbourethral glands) have various functions in different species. The\nsecretions may lubricate, flush out urine or form a gelatinous plug that traps the semen\nin the female reproductive system after copulation and prevents other males of the same\nspeciesfertilizinganalreadymatedfemale. Cowper\u2019sglandsareabsentinbearsandaquatic\nmammals.\n13.5.4 The Penis\nThe penis consists of connective tissue with numerous small blood spaces in it. These fill\nwith blood during sexual excitement causing erection.\nPenis Form And Shape\nDogs, bears, seals, bats and rodents have a special bone in the penis which helps maintain\ntheerection(seediagram13.2). Insomeanimals(e.g. thebull, ramandboar)thepenishas\nan \u201cS\u201d shaped bend that allows it to fold up when not in use. In many animals the shape\nof the penis is adapted to match that of the vagina. For example, the boar has a corkscrew\nshaped penis, there is a pronounced twist in bulls\u2019 and it is forked in marsupials like the\nopossum. Some have spines, warts or hooks on them to help keep them in the vagina and\ncopulation may be extended to help retain the semen in the female system. Mating can\nlast up to three hours in minks, and dogs may \u201cknot\u201d or \u201ctie\u201d during mating and can not\nseparate until the erection has subsided.\n172 The Male Reproductive System\n13.5.5 Sperm\nSperm are made up of three parts: a head consisting mainly of the nucleus, a midpiece\ncontaining many mitochondria to provide the energy and a tail that provides propulsion\n(see diagram 13.5).\nFigure 129\nDiagram 13.5 - A sperm\nA single ejaculation may contain 2-3 hundred million sperm but even in normal semen as\nmanyas10%ofthesespermmaybeabnormalandinfertile. Somemaybedeadwhileothers\nare inactive or deformed with double, giant or small heads or tails that are coiled or absent\naltogether.\nWhen there are too many abnormal sperm or when the sperm concentration is low, the\nsemen may not be able to fertilize an egg and the animal is infertile. Make sure you don\u2019t\nconfuse infertility with impotence, which is the inability to copulate successfully.\nSperm do not live forever. They have a definite life span that varies from species to species.\nThey survive for between 20 days (guinea pig) to 60 days (bull) in the epididymis but once\nejaculated into the female tract they only live from 12 to 48 hours. When semen is used for\nartificial insemination, storage under the right conditions can extend the life span of some\nspecies.\n13.5.6 Artificial Insemination\nIn manyspecies the male can be artificially stimulatedto ejaculate and the semen collected.\nItcanthenbediluted, storedandusedtoinseminatefemales. Forexamplebullsemencan\nbe diluted and stored for up to 3 weeks at room temperature. If mixed with an antifreeze\nsolution and stored in \u201cstraws\u201d in liquid nitrogen at minus 79oC it will keep for much longer.\nUnfortunately the semen of chickens, stallions and boars can only be stored for up to 2\ndays.\nDilution of the semen means that one male can be used to fertilise many more females than\nwould occur under natural conditions. There are also advantages in the male and female\nnot having to make physical contact. It means that owners of females do not have to buy\n173 Reproductive System\nexpensivemalesandthepossibilityoftransmittingsexuallytransmitteddiseasesisreduced.\nRoutine examination of the semen for sperm concentration, quality and activity allows only\nthe highest quality semen to be used so a high success rate is ensured.\nSince the lifespan of sperm in the female tract is so short and ova only survive from 8 to\n10 hours the timing of the artificial insemination is critical. Successful conception depends\nupon detecting the time that the animal is \u201con heat\u201d and when ovulation occurs.\n13.6 The Female Reproductive Organs\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries that produce egg cells or ova\nand fallopian tubes where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the\nuterus . Growth of the foetus takes place here. The cervix separates the uterus from the\nvagina or birth canal, where the sperm are deposited (see diagram 13.6).\nFigure 130\nDiagram 13.6. - The reproductive system of a female rabbit\nNote that primates like humans have a uterus with a single compartment but in most\nmammals the uterus is divided into two separate parts or horns as shown in diagram 13.6.\n174 The Female Reproductive Organs\n13.6.1 The Ovaries\nOvaries are small oval organs situated in the abdominal cavity just ventral to the kidneys.\nMost animals have a pair of ovaries but in birds only the left one is functional to reduce\nweight (see below).\nThe ovary consists of an inner region (medulla ) and an outer region (cortex ) containing\negg cells or ova. These are formed in large numbers around the time of birth and start\nto develop after the animal becomes sexually mature. A cluster of cells called the follicle\nsurrounds and nourishes each ovum.\n13.6.2 The Ovarian Cycle\nThe ovarian cycle refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle\nmatures, the ovum is shed and the corpus luteum develops (see diagram 13.7).\nNumerous undeveloped ovarian follicles are present at birth but they start to mature after\nsexual maturity. In animals that normally have only one baby at a time only one ovum will\nmature at once but in litter animals several will. The mature follicle consists of outer cells\nthat provide nourishment. Inside this is a fluid-filled space that contains the ovum.\nA mature follicle can be quite large, ranging from a few millimetres in small mammals to\nthe size of a golf ball in large animals. It bulges out from the surface of the ovary before\neventually rupturing to release the ovum into the abdominal cavity. Once the ovum has\nbeen shed, a blood clot forms in the empty follicle. This develops into a tissue called\nthe corpus luteum that produces the hormone progesterone (see diagram 13.9). If\nthe animal becomes pregnant the corpus luteum persists, but if there is no pregnancy it\ndegenerates and a new ovarian cycle usually.\nFigure 131\nDiagram 13.7 - The ovarian cycle showing from the top left clockwise: the maturation of\nthe ovum over time, followed by ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum in the\nempty follicle\n175 Reproductive System\n13.6.3 The Ovum\nWhen the ovum is shed the nucleus is in the final stages of meiosis (cell division). It is\nsurrounded by few layers of follicle cells and a tough membrane called the zona pelluc ida\n(see diagram 13.8).\nFigure 132\nDiagram 13.8 - An ovum\n13.6.4 The Oestrous Cycle\nThe oestrous cycle is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the ovarian\ncycle. Thesechangesinfluencethebehaviourandbodychangesofthefemale(seediagram\n13.9).\nFigure 133\nDiagram 13.9 - The oestrous cycle\nThe first hormone involved in the oestrous cycle is follicle stimulating hormone\n(F.S.H.), secreted by the anterior pituitary gland (see chapter 16). It stimulates the\n176 The Female Reproductive Organs\nfollicle to develop. As the follicle matures the outer cells begin to secrete the hormone oe-\nstrogen and this stimulates the mammary glands to develop. It also prepares the lining of\nthe uterus to receive a fertilised egg. Ovulation is initiated by a surge of another hormone\nfrom the anterior pituitary, luteinising hormone (L.H.). This hormone also influences\nthe development of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone , a hormone that\nprepares the lining of the uterus for the fertilised ovum and readies the mammary glands\nfor milk production. If no pregnancy takes place the corpus luteum shrinks and the produc-\ntion of progesterone decreases. This causes FSH to be produced again and a new oestrous\ncycle begins.\nFor fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm to occur, the female must be receptive to the\nmale at around the time of ovulation. This is when the hormones turn on the signs of \u201cheat\n\u201d, and she is \u201cin season \u201d or \u201cin oestrous \u201d. These signs are turned off again at the end of\nthe oestrous cycle.\nDuring the oestrous cycle the lining of the uterus (endometrium ) thickens ready for the\nfertilised ovum to be implanted. If no pregnancy occurs this thickened tissue is absorbed\nand the next cycle starts. In humans and other higher primates, however, the endometrium\nis shed as a flow of blood and instead of an oestrous cycle there is a menstrual cycle .\nThe length of the oestrous cycle varies from species to species. In rats the cycle only lasts\n4-5 days and they are sexually receptive for about 14 hours. Dogs have a cycle that lasts\n60-70 days and heat lasts 7-9 days and horses have a 21-day cycle and heat lasts an average\nof 6 days.\nOvulation is spontaneous in most animals but in some, e.g. the cat, and the rabbit,\novulation is stimulated by mating. This is called induced ovulation .\n13.6.5 Signs Of Oestrous Or Heat\n\u2022 When on heat a bitch has a blood stained discharge from the vulva that changes a little\nlater to a straw coloured one that attracts all the dogs in the neighbourhood.\n\u2022 Female cats \u201ccall\u201d at night, roll and tread the carpet and are generally restless but will\n\u201cstand\u201d firm when pressure is placed on the pelvic region (this is the lordosis response).\n\u2022 A female rat shows the lordosis response when on heat. It will \u201cmount\u201d other females\nand be more active than normal.\n\u2022 A cow mounts other cows (bulling), bellows, is restless and has a discharge from the\nvulva.\n13.6.6 Breeding Seasons And Breeding Cycles\nOnly a few animals breed throughout the year. This includes the higher primates (humans,\ngorillas and chimpanzees etc.), pigs, mice and rabbits. These are known as continuous\nbreeders .\nMostotheranimalsrestrictreproductiontooneortwoseasonsintheyear-seasonal breed-\ners (see diagram 13.10). There are several reasons for this. It means the young can be born\nat the time (usually spring) when feed is most abundant and temperatures are favourable.\nIt is also sensible to restrict the breeding season because courtship, mating, gestation and\n177 Reproductive System\nthe rearing of young can exhaust the energy resources of an animal as well as make them\nmore vulnerable to predators.\nFigure 134\nDiagram 13.10 - Breeding cycles\nThe timing of the breeding cycle is often determined by day length. For example the\nshortening day length in autumn will bring sheep and cows into season so the foetus can\ngestate through the winter and be born in spring. In cats the increasing day length after\nthe winter solstice (shortest day) stimulates breeding. The number of times an animal\ncomes into season during the year varies, as does the number of oestrous cycles during each\nseason. For example a dog usually has 2-3 seasons per year, each usually consisting of just\noneoestrouscycle. Incontrastewesusuallyrestrictbreedingtooneseasonandcancontinue\nto cycle as many as 20 times if they fail to become pregnant.\n13.7 Fertilisation and Implantation\n13.7.1 Fertilisation\nThe opening of the fallopian tube lies close to the ovary and after ovulation the ovum is\nswept into its funnel-like opening and is moved along it by the action of cilia and wave-like\ncontractions of the wall.\nCopulation deposits several hundred million sperm in the vagina. They swim through the\ncervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes moved along by whip-like movements of their tails\nand contractions of the uterus. During this journey the sperm undergo their final phase of\nmaturation so they are ready to fertilise the ovum by the time they reach it in the upper\nfallopian tube.\n178 Pregnancy\nHigh mortality means only a small proportion of those deposited actually reach the ovum.\nThe sperm attach to the outer zona pellucida and enzymes secreted from a gland in the\nhead of the sperm dissolve this membrane so it can enter. Once one sperm has entered,\nchanges in the zona pellucida prevent further sperm from penetrating. The sperm loses\nits tail and the two nuclei fuse to form a zygote with the full set of paired chromosomes\nrestored.\n13.7.2 Development Of The Morula And Blastocyst\nAs the fertilised egg travels down the fallopian tube it starts to divide by mitosis. First\ntwo cells are formed and then four, eight, sixteen, etc. until there is a solid ball of cells.\nThis is called a morula . As division continues a hollow ball of cells develops. This is a\nblastocyst (see diagram 13.11).\n13.7.3 Implantation\nImplantation involves the blastocyst attaching to, and in some species, completely sinking\ninto the wall of the uterus.\n13.8 Pregnancy\n13.8.1 The Placenta And Foetal Membranes\nAs the embryo increases in size, the placenta , umbilical cord and foetal membranes\n(often known collectively as the placenta ) develop to provide it with nutrients and remove\nwaste products (see diagram 13.12). In later stages of development the embryo becomes\nknown as a foetus .\nThe placenta is the organ that attaches the foetus to the wall of the uterus. In it the blood\nof the foetus and mother flow close to each other but never mix (see diagram 13.13). The\ncloseness of the maternal and foetal blood systems allows diffusion between them. Oxygen\nand nutrients diffuse from the mother\u2019s blood into that of the foetus and carbon dioxide\nand excretory products diffuse in the other direction. Most maternal hormones (except\nadrenaline), antibodies, almost all drugs (including alcohol), lead and DDT also pass across\nthe placenta. However, it protects the foetus from infection with bacteria and most viruses.\n179 Reproductive System\nFigure 135\nDiagram 13.11 - Development and implantation of the embryo\nFigure 136\nDiagram 13.12. The foetus and placenta\nThe foetus is attached to the placenta by the umbilical cord . It contains arteries that\ncarry blood to the placenta and a vein that returns blood to the foetus. The developing\nfoetus becomes surrounded by membranes. These enclose the amniotic fluid that protects\nthe foetus from knocks and other trauma (see diagram 13.12).\n180 Pregnancy\nFigure 137\nDiagram 13.13 - Maternal and foetal blood flow in the placenta\n13.8.2 Hormones During Pregnancy\nThecorpusluteumcontinuestosecreteprogesteroneandoestrogenduringpregnancy. These\nmaintaintheliningoftheuterusandpreparethemammaryglandsformilksecretion. Later\nin the pregnancy the placenta itself takes over the secretion of these hormones.\nChorionic gonadotrophin is another hormone secreted by the placenta and placental\nmembranes. It prevents uterine contractions before labour and prepares the mammary\nglandsforlactation. Towardstheendofpregnancytheplacentaandovariessecreterelaxin\n, a hormone that eases the joint between the two parts of the pelvis and helps dilate the\ncervix ready for birth.\n13.8.3 Pregnancy Testing\nThe easiest method of pregnancy detection is ultrasound which is noninvasive and very\nreliable Later in gestation pregnancy can be detected by taking x-rays.\nIn dogs and cats a blood test can be used to detect the hormone relaxin .\nIn mares and cows palpation of the uterus via the rectum is the classic way to determine\npregnancy. It can also be done by detecting the hormones progesterone or equine chori-\nonic gonagotrophin (eCG ) in the urine. A new sensitive test measures the amount of\nthe hormone, oestrone sulphate , present in a sample of faeces. The hormone is produced\nby the foal and placenta, and is only present when there is a living foal.\nIn most animals, once pregnancy is advanced, there is a window of time during which an\nexperienced veterinarian can determine pregnancy by feeling the abdomen.\n181 Reproductive System\n13.8.4 Gestation Period\nThe young of many animals (e.g. pigs, horses and elephants) are born at an advanced state\nof development, able to stand and even run to escape predators soon after they are born.\nThese animals have a relatively long gestation period that varies with their size e.g. from\n114 days in the pig to 640 days in the elephant.\nIn contrast, cats, dogs, mice, rabbits and higher primates are relatively immature when\nborn and totally dependent on their parents for survival. Their gestation period is shorter\nand varies from 25 days in the mouse to 31 days in rabbits and 258 days in the gorilla.\nThebabiesofmarsupialsarebornatanextremelyimmaturestageandmigratetothepouch\nwhere they attach to a teat to complete their development. Kangaroo joeys, for example,\nare born 33 days after conception and opossums after only 8 days.\n13.9 Birth\n13.9.1 Signs Of Imminent Birth\nAsthepregnancycontinues,themammaryglandsenlargeandmaysecreteamilkysubstance\na few days before birth occurs. The vulva may swell and produce thick mucus and there is\nsometimes a visible change in the position of the foetus. Just before birth the mother often\nbecomesrestless, lyingdownandgettingupfrequently. Manyanimalsseekasecludedplace\nwhere they may build a nest in which to give birth.\n13.9.2 Labour\nLabourinvolveswavesofuterinecontractionsthatpressthefoetusagainstthecervixcausing\nit to dilate. The foetus is then pushed through the cervix and along the vagina before being\ndelivered. In the final stage of labour the placenta or \u201cafterbirth\u201d is expelled.\n13.9.3 Adaptations Of The Foetus To Life Outside The Uterus\nThe foetus grows in the watery, protected environment of the uterus where the mother sup-\nplies oxygen and nutrients, and waste products pass to her blood circulation for excretion.\nOnce the baby animal is born it must start to breathe for itself, digest food and excrete\nits own waste. To allow these functions to occur blood is re-routed to the lungs and the\nglands associated with the gut start to secrete. Note that newborn animals can not control\ntheir own body temperature. They need to be kept warm by the mother, littermates and\ninsulating nest materials.\n13.10 Milk Production\nCows, manatees and primates have two mammary glands but animals like pigs that give\nbirth to large litters may have as many as 12 pairs. Ducts from the gland lead to a nipple\n182 Reproduction In Birds\nor teat and there may be a sinus where the milk collects before being suckled (see diagram\n13.14).\nFigure 138\nDiagram 13.14 - A mammary gland\nThe hormones oestrogen and progesterone stimulate the mammary glands to develop\nand prolactin promotes the secretion of the milk. Oxytocin from the pituitary gland\nreleases the milk when the baby suckles. The first milk is called colostrum . It is a rich\nin nutrients and contains protective antibodies from the mother. Milk contains fat, protein\nand milk sugar as well as vitamins and most minerals although it contains little iron. Its\nactual composition varies widely from species to species. For example whale\u2019s and seal\u2019s\nmilk has twelve times more fat and four times more protein than cow\u2019s milk. Cow\u2019s milk\nhas far less protein in it than cat\u2019s or dog\u2019s milk. This is why orphan kittens and puppies\ncannot be fed cow\u2019s milk.\n13.11 Reproduction In Birds\nMale birds have testes and sperm ducts and male swans, ducks, geese and ostriches have\na penis. However, most birds make do with a small amount of erectile tissue known as a\npapilla . To reduce weight for flight most female birds only have one ovary - usually the\nleft, which produces extremely yolky eggs. The eggs are fertilised in the upper part of the\noviduct (equivalent to the fallopian tube and uterus of mammals) and as they pass down\nit albumin (the white of the egg), the membrane beneath the shell and the shell are laid\ndown over the yolk. Finally the egg is covered in a layer of mucus to help the bird lay it\n(see diagram 13.15).\n183 Reproductive System\nMost birds lay their eggs in a nest and the hen sits on them until they hatch. Ducklings\nand chicks are relatively well developed when they hatch and able to forage for their own\nfood. Most other nestlings need their parents to keep them warm, clean and fed. Young\nbirds grow rapidly and have voracious appetites that may involve the parents making up to\n1000 trips a day to supply their need for food.\nFigure 139\nDiagram 13.15 - Female reproductive organs of a bird\n13.12 Summary\n\u2022 Haploid gametes (sperm and ova) are produced by meiosis in the gonads (testes and\novaries).\n\u2022 Fertilisation involves the fusing of the gametes to form a diploid zygote .\n\u2022 The male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes that produce sperm (or sper-\nmatozoa ), ducts that transport the sperm to the penis and glands that add secretions\nto the sperm to make semen.\n184 Worksheet\n\u2022 Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules , are stored in the epididymis and\ntravel via the vas deferens or sperm duct to the junction of the bladder and the\nurethra where various accessory glands add secretions. The fluid is now called semen\nand is ejaculated into the female system down the urethra that runs down the centre of\nthe penis.\n\u2022 Sperm consist of a head, a midpiece and a tail.\n\u2022 Infertility is the inability of sperm to fertilize an egg while impotence is the inability\nto copulate successfully.\n\u2022 The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries that produce ova and\nfallopian tubes where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the\nuterus . Growth of the foetus takes place here. The cervix separates the uterus from\nthe vagina , the birth canal and where the sperm are deposited.\n\u2022 The ovarian cycle refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle\nmatures, the ovum is shed and the corpus luteum develops.\n\u2022 The oestrous cycle is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the ovar-\nian cycle. It is initiated by the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (F.S.H.),\nby the anterior pituitary gland which stimulates the follicle to develop. The follicle\nsecretes oestrogen which stimulates mammary gland development. luteinising hor-\nmone (L.H.) from the anterior pituitary initiates ovulation and stimulates the corpus\nluteum to develop. The corpus luteum produces progesterone that prepares the lining\nof the uterus for the fertilised ovum.\n\u2022 Signs of oestrous or heat differ. A bitch has a blood stained discharge, female cats and\nrats are restless and show the lordosis response, while cows mount other cows, bellow and\nhave a discharge from the vulva.\n\u2022 After fertilisation in the fallopian tube the zygote divides over and over by mitosis to\nbecome a ball of cells called a morula . Division continues to form a hollow ball of cells\ncalled the blastocyst . This is the stage that implants in the uterus.\n\u2022 The placenta, umbilical cord and foetal membranes (known as the placenta )\nprotect and provide the developing foetus with nutrients and remove waste products.\n13.13 Worksheet\nReproductive System Worksheet1\n13.14 Test Yourself\n1.

They need to be able to sense the temperature of their surroundings, for\nexample, so they can avoid the hot sun. They must also be able to identify food and escape\npredators.\nThe various systems and organs in the body must also be linked so they work together.\nFor example, once a predator has identified suitable prey it has to catch it. This involves\ncoordinating the contraction of the muscle so the predator can run, there must then be an\nincreased blood supply to the muscles to provide them with oxygen and nutrients. At the\nsame time the respiration rate must increase to supply the oxygen and remove the carbon\ndioxide produced as a result of this increased activity. Once the prey has been caught and\neaten, the digestive system must be activated to digest it.\nTheadjustmentofananimal\u2019sresponsetochangesintheenvironmentandthecomplexlink-\ningofthevariousprocessesinthebodythatthisresponseinvolvesarecalledco-ordination\n. Two systems are involved in co-ordination in animals. These are the nervous and en-\ndocrine systems . The first operates via electrical impulses along nerve fibres and the\nsecond by releasing special chemicals or hormones into the bloodstream from glands.\n14.3 Functions of the Nervous System\nThe nervous system has three basic functions:\n1. Sensory function - to sense changes (known as stimuli) both outside and within the\nbody. For example the eyes sense changes in light and the ear responds to sound waves.\n190 The Neuron\nInside the body, stretch receptors in the stomach indicate when it is full and chemical\nreceptors in the blood vessels monitor the acidity of the blood.\n2. Integrative function - processing the information received from the sense organs.\nThe impulses from these organs are analysed and stored as memory. The many different\nimpulses from different sources are sorted, synchronised and co-ordinated and the appro-\npriate response initiated. The power to integrate, remember and apply experience gives\nhigher animals much of their superiority.\n3. Motor function - The third function is the response to the stimulithat causes muscles\nto contract or glands to secrete.\nAll nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells or neurons. These transmit high-speed signals\ncalled nerve impulses . Nerve impulses can be thought of as being similar to an electric\ncurrent.\n14.4 The Neuron\nNeurons are cells that have been adapted to carry nerve impulses. A typical neuron has a\ncell body containing a nucleus, one or more branching filaments called dendrites which\nconduct nerve impulses towards the cell body and one long fibre, an axon , that carries\nthe impulses away from it. Many axons have a sheath of fatty material called myelin\nsurrounding them. This speeds up the rate at which the nerve impulses travel along the\nnerve (see diagram 14.1).\nFigure 141\nDiagram 14.1 - A motor neuron\nThecellbodyofneuronsisusuallylocatedinthebrainorspinalcordwhiletheaxonextends\nthe whole distance to the organ that it supplies. The neuron carrying impulses from the\n191 Nervous System\nspinal cord to the hind leg or tail of a horse, for example, can be several feet long. A nerve\nis a bundle of axons.\nA sensory neuron is a nerve cell that transmits impulses from a sense receptor such as\nthose in the eye or ear to the brain or spinal cord. A motor neuron is a nerve cell that\ntransmits impulses from the brain or spinal cord to a muscle or gland. A relay neuron\nconnects sensory and motor neurons and is found in the brain or spinal cord (see diagrams\n14.1 and 14.2).\nFigure 142\nDiagram 14.2 - The relationship between sensory, relay and motor neurons\n14.4.1 Connections Between Neurons\nThe connection between adjacent neurons is called a synapse . The two nerve cells do\nnot actually touch here for there is a microscopic space between them. The electrical\nimpulse in the neurone before the synapse stimulates the production of chemicals called\nneurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine ), which are secreted into the gap.\nTheneurotransmitterchemicalsdiffuseacrossthegapandwhentheycontactthemembrane\nof the next nerve cell they stimulate a new nervous impulse (see diagram 14.3). After the\nimpulse has passed the chemical is destroyed and the synapse is ready to receive the next\nnerve impulse.\n192 Reflexes\nFigure 143\nDiagram 14.3 - A nerve and magnification of a synapse\n14.5 Reflexes\nA reflex is a rapid automatic response to a stimulus. When you accidentally touch a hot\nobject and automatically jerk your hand away, this is a reflex action. It happens without\nyou having to think about it. Animals automatically blink when an object approaches the\neye and cats twist their bodies in the air when falling so they land on their paws. (Please\ndon\u2019t test this one at home with your pet cat!).\nSwallowing, sneezing, and the constriction of the pupil of the eye in bright light are also all\nreflex actions.\nThe path taken by the nerve impulses in a reflex is called a reflex arc . Most reflex arcs\ninvolve only three neurons (see diagram 14.4). The stimulus (a pin in the paw) stimulates\nthe pain receptors of the skin, which initiate an impulse in a sensory neuron. This travels\nto the spinal cord where it passes, by means of a synapse, to a connecting neuron called the\nrelayneuronsituatedinthespinalcord. Therelayneuroninturnmakesasynapsewithone\normoremotorneuronsthattransmittheimpulsetothemusclesofthelimbcausingthemto\ncontract and remove the paw from the sharp object. Reflexes do not require involvement of\nthe brain although you are aware of what is happening and can, in some instances, prevent\nthem happening. Animals are born with their reflexes. You can think of them as being\nwired in.\n193 Nervous System\nFigure 144\nDiagram 14.4 - A reflex arc\n14.5.1 Conditioned Reflexes\nIn most reflexes the stimulus and response are related. For example the presence of food\nin the mouth causes the salivary glands to release saliva. However, it is possible to train\nanimals (and humans) to respond to different and often quite irrelevant stimuli. This is\ncalled a conditioned reflex .\nA Russian biologist called Pavlov carried out the classic experiment to demonstrate such\na reflex when he conditioned dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell ringing. Almost every\npet owner can identify reflexes they have conditioned in their animals. Perhaps you have\ntrained your cat to associate food with the opening of the fridge door or accustomed your\ndog to the routines you go through before taking them for a walk.\n14.6 Parts of the Nervous System\nWhen we describe the nervous system of vertebrates we usually divide it into two parts (see\ndiagram 14.5).\n1. The central nervous system (CNS ) which consists of the brain and spinal cord.\n2. The peripheral nervous system (PNS ) which consists of the nerves that connect\nto the brain and spinal cord (cranial and spinal nerves) as well as the autonomic (or\ninvoluntary) nervous system.\n194 Parts of the Nervous System\nFigure 145\nDiagram 14.5 - The nervous system of a horse\n14.6.1 The Central Nervous System\nThe central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a kind of\n\u2018telephone exchange\u2019 where a vast number of cross connections are made.\nWhen you look at the brain or spinal cord some regions appear creamy white (white\nmatter ) and others appear grey (grey matter ). White matter consists of masses of\nnerve axons and the grey matter consists of the nerve cells. In the brain the grey matter is\non the outside and in the spinal cord it is on the inside (see diagram 14.2).\nThe Brain\nThe major part of the brain lies protected within the sturdy \u201cbox\u201d of skull called the cra-\nnium . Surrounding the fragile brain tissue (and spinal cord) are protective membranes\ncalled the meninges (see diagram 14.6), and a crystal-clear fluid called cerebrospinal\nfluid , which protects and nourishes the brain tissue. This fluid also fills four cavities or\nventricles that lie within the brain.\nBrain tissue is extremely active and, even when an animal is resting, it uses up to 20% of\nthe oxygen taken into the body by the lungs. The carotid artery , a branch off the dorsal\naorta, supplies it with the oxygen and nutrients it requires. Brain damage occurs if brain\ntissue is deprived of oxygen for only 4-8 minutes.\n195 Nervous System\nThe brain consists of three major regions:\n1. the fore brain which includes the cerebral hemispheres , hypothalamus and\npituitary gland ;\n2. the hind brain or brain stem , contains the medulla oblongata and pons and\n3. the cerebellum or \u201clittle brain\u201d (see diagram 14.6).\nFigure 146\nDiagram 14.6 - Longitudinal section through the brain of a dog\nMapping the brain\nIn humans and some animals the functions of the different regions of the cerebral cortex\nhave been mapped (see diagram 14.7).\nDiagram 14.7 - The functions of the regions of the human cerebral cortex\n196 Parts of the Nervous System\nThe Forebrain\nThe cerebral hemispheres are the masses of brain tissue that sit on the top of the brain.\nThe surface is folded into ridges and furrows called sulci (singular sulcus). They make\nthis part of the brain look rather like a very large walnut kernel. The two hemispheres are\nseparated by a deep groove although they are connected internally by a thick bundle of\nnerve fibres. The outer layer of each hemisphere is called the cerebral cortex and this is\nwhere the main functions of the cerebral hemispheres are carried out.\nThe cerebral cortex is large and convoluted in mammals compared to other vertebrates and\nlargest of all in humans because this is where the so-called \u201chigher centres\u201d concerned with\nmemory, learning, reasoning and intelligence are situated.\nNerves from the eyes, ears, nose and skin bring sensory impulses to the cortex where they\nare interpreted. Appropriate voluntary movements are initiated here in the light of the\nmemories of past events.\nDifferent regions of the cortex are responsible for particular sensory and motor functions,\ne.g. vision, hearing, taste, smell, or moving the fore-limbs, hind-limbs or tail. For example,\nwhen a dog sniffs a scent, sensory impulses from the organ of smell in the nose pass via the\nolfactory (smelling) nerve to the olfactory centres of the cerebral hemispheres where the\nimpulses are interpreted and co-ordinated.\nIn humans and some animals the functions of the different regions of the cerebral cortex\nhave been mapped (see diagram 14.8).\nFigure 147\nDiagram 14.8 - The functions of the regions of the cerebral cortex\nThe hypothalamus is situated at the base of the brain and is connected by a \u201cstalk\u201d\nto the pituitary gland , the \u201cmaster\u201d hormone-producing gland (see chapter 16). The\nhypothalamuscanbethoughtofasthebridgebetweenthenervousandendocrine(hormone\n197 Nervous System\nproducing) systems. It produces some of the hormones that are released from the pituitary\ngland and controls the release of others from it.\nIt is also an important centre for controlling the internal environment of the animal and\ntherefore maintaining homeostasis. For example, it helps regulate the movement of food\nthrough the gut and the temperature, blood pressure and concentration of the blood. It is\nalso responsible for the feeling of being hungry or thirsty and it controls sleep patterns and\nsex drive.\nThe Hindbrain\nThe medulla oblongata is at the base of the brain and is a continuation of the spinal\ncord. It carries all signals between the spinal cord and the brain and contains centres that\ncontrol vital body functions like the basic rhythm of breathing, the rate of the heartbeat\nandtheactivitiesofthegut. Themedullaoblongataalsoco-ordinatesswallowing,vomiting,\ncoughing and sneezing.\nThe Cerebellum\nThecerebellum(littlebrain)looksratherlikeasmallerversionofthecerebralhemispheres\nattached to the back of the brain. It receives impulses from the organ of balance (vestibular\norgan) in the inner ear and from stretch receptors in the muscles and tendons. By co-\nordinating these it regulates muscle contraction during walking and running and helps\nmaintain the posture and balance of the animal. When the cerebellum malfunctions it\ncauses a tremor and uncoordinated movement.\nThe Spinal Cord\nThe spinal cord is a cable of nerve tissue that passes down the channel in the vertebrae\nfrom the hindbrain to the end of the tail. It becomes progressively smaller as paired spinal\nnerves pass out of the cord to parts of the body. Protective membranes or meninges cover\nthe cord and these enclose cerebral spinal fluid (see diagram 14.9).\n198 Parts of the Nervous System\nFigure 148\nDiagram 14.9 - The spinal cord\nIf you cut across the spinal cord you can see that it consists of white matter on the outside\nand grey matter in the shape of an H or butterfly on the inside.\n14.6.2 The Peripheral Nervous System\nThe peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that are connected to the brain (cra-\nnial nerves ), and nerves that are connected to the spinal cord (spinal nerves ). The\nautonomic nervous systemis also part of the peripheral nervous system.\nCranial Nerves\nThere are twelve pairs of cranial nerves that come from the brain. Each passes through\na hole in the cranium (brain case). The most important of these are the olfactory, optic,\nacoustic and vagus nerves.\nThe olfactory nerves - (smell) carry impulses from the olfactory organ of the nose to the\nbrain.\nThe optic nerves - (sight) carry impulses from the retina of the eye to the brain.\nThe auditory (acoustic) nerves - (hearing) carry impulses from the cochlear of the inner\near to the brain.\nThe vagus nerve - controls the muscles that bring about swallowing. It also controls the\nmuscles of the heart, airways, lungs, stomach and intestines (see diagram 14.5).\n199 Nervous System\nSpinal Nerves\nSpinal nerves connect the spinal cord to sense organs, muscles and glands in the body.\nPairs of spinal nerves leave the spinal cord and emerge between each pair of adjacent ver-\ntebrae (see diagram 14.9).\nThe sciatic nerve is the largest spinal nerve in the body (see diagram 14.5). It leaves the\nspinal cord as several nerves that join to form a flat band of nervous tissue. It passes down\nthe thigh towards the hind leg where it gives off branches to the various muscles of this\nlimb.\nThe Autonomic Nervous System\nThe autonomic nervous system controls internal body functions that are not under\nconscious control. For example when a prey animal is chased by a predator the autonomic\nnervous system automatically increases the rate of breathing and the heartbeat. It dilates\nthe blood vessels that carry blood to the muscles, releases glucose from the liver, and\nmakes other adjustments to provide for the sudden increase in activity. When the animal\nhas escaped and is safe once again the nervous system slows down all these processes and\nresumes all the normal body activities like the digestion of food.\nThe nerves of the autonomic nervous system originate in the spinal cord and pass out be-\ntweenthevertebraetoservethevariousorgans(seediagram14.10).Therearetwomainparts\nto the autonomic nervous system -- the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic\nsystem .\nThe sympathetic system stimulates the \u201cflight, fright, fight\u201d response that allows an\nanimal to face up to an attacker or make a rapid departure. It increases the heart and\nrespiratory rates, as well as the amount of blood flowing to the skeletal muscles while blood\nflow to less critical regions like the gut and skin is reduced. It also causes the pupils of the\neyes to dilate. Note that the effects of the sympathetic system are similar to the effects of\nthe hormone adrenaline (see Chapter 16).\nThe parasympathetic system does the opposite to the sympathetic system. It maintains\nthe normal functions of the relaxed body. These are sometimes known as the \u201chousekeep-\ning\u201d functions. It promotes effective digestion, stimulates defaecation and urination and\nmaintains a regular heartbeat and rate of breathing.\n200 Summary\nFigure 149\nDiagram 14.10 - The function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems\n14.7 Summary\n\u2022 The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system. It consists of a cell body with\na nucleus, filaments known as dendrites and a long fibre known as the axon often\nsurrounded by a myelin sheath .\n\u2022 A nerve is a bundle of axons.\n201 Nervous System\n\u2022 Grey matter in the brain and spinal cord consists mainly of brain cells while white\nmatte r consists of masses of axons.\n\u2022 Nerve Impulses travel along axons.\n\u2022 Adjacent neurons connect with each other at synapses .\n\u2022 Reflexes are automatic responses to stimuli. The path taken by nerve impulses involved\nin reflexes is a reflex arc . Most reflex arcs involve 3 neurons - a sensory neuron , a\nrelay neuron anda motor neuron . Astimulus, apininthepawforexample, initiates\nan impulse in the sensory neuron that passes via a synapse to the relay neuron situated\nin the spinal cord and then via another synapse to the motor neurone. This transmits\nthe impulse to the muscle causing it to contract and remove the paw from the pin.\n\u2022 The nervous system is divided into 2 parts: the central nervous system , consisting\nof the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system consisting of nerves\nconnected to the brain and spinal cord. The autonomic nervous system is considered\nto be part of the peripheral nervous system.\n\u2022 The brain consists of three major regions: 1. the fore brain which includes the cere-\nbral hemispheres (or cerebrum ), hypothalamus and pituitary gland ; 2. the\nhindbrain or brain stem containing the medulla oblongata and 3. the cerebellum\n.\n\u2022 Protective membranes known as the meninges surround the brain and spinal cord.\n\u2022 There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that include the optic, olfactory, acoustic and vagus\nnerves.\n\u2022 Thespinal cordisacableofnervetissuesurroundedbymeningespassingfromthebrain\nto the end of the tail. Spinal nerves emerge by a ventral and dorsal root between\neach vertebra and connect the spinal cord with organs and muscles.\n\u2022 The autonomic nervous system controls internal body functions not under conscious\ncontrol. It is divided into 2 parts with 2 different functions: the sympathetic nervous\nsystem that is involved in the flight and fight response including increased heart rate,\nbronchial dilation, dilation of the pupil and decreased gut activity. The parasympa-\nthetic nervous system is associated with decreased heart rate, pupil constriction and\nincreased gut activity.\n14.8 Worksheet\nNervous System Worksheet1\n14.9 Test Yourself\n1.

They enable animals to avoid hostile envi-\nronments, sense the presence of predators and find food.\nAnimals can sense a wide range of stimuli that includes, touch, pressure, pain, temperature,\nchemicals,light,sound,movementandpositionofthebody. Someanimalscansenseelectric\nand magnetic fields. All sense organs respond to stimuli by producing nerve impulses that\ntravel to the brain via a sensory nerve. The impulses are then processed and interpreted in\nthe brain as pain, sight, sound, taste etc.\nThe senses are often divided into two groups:\n1. The general senses of touch, pressure, pain and temperature that are distributed\nfairly evenly through the skin. Some are found in muscles and within joints.\n2. The special senses whichincludethesensesofsmell, taste, sight, hearingandbalance.\nThe special sense organs may be quite complex in structure.\n15.3 Touch And Pressure\nWithin the dermis of the skin are numerous modified nerve endings that are sensitive to\ntouch and pressure. The roots of hairs may also be well supplied with sensory receptors\nthat inform the animal that it is in contact with an object (see diagram 15.1). Whiskers\nare specially modified hairs.\n206 Pain\n15.4 Pain\nReceptorsthatsensepainarefoundinalmosteverytissueofthebody. Theytelltheanimal\nthat tissues are dangerously hot, cold, compressed or stretched or that there is not enough\nblood flowing in them. The animal may then be able to respond and protect itself from\nfurther damage\nFigure 153\nDiagram 15.1 - The general senses in the skin\n15.5 Temperature\nNerve endings in the skin respond to hot and cold stimuli (See diagram 15.1).\n15.6 Awareness Of Limb Position\nThere are sense organs in the muscles, tendons and joints that send continuous impulses to\nthe brain that tell it where each limb is. This information allows the animal to place its\nlimbs accurately and know their exact position without having to watch them.\n15.7 Smell\nAnimals use the sense of smell to locate food, mark territory, identify their own offspring\nand the presence and sexual condition of a potential mate. The organ of smell (olfactory\norgan ) is located in the nose and responds to chemicals in the air. It consists of modified\nnerve cells that have several tiny hairs on the surface. These emerge from the epithelium on\n207 The Senses\nthe roof of the nose cavity into the mucus that lines it. As the animal breathes, chemicals\nin the air dissolve in the mucus. When the sense cell responds to a particular molecule, it\nfires an impulse that travels along the olfactory nerve to the brain where it is interpreted\nas an odour (see diagram 15.2).\nFigure 154\nDiagram 15.2 - The olfactory organ - the sense of smell\nTheolfactorysenseinhumansisrudimentarycomparedtothatofmanyanimals. Carnivores\nthat hunt have a very highly developed sensitivity to scents. For example a polar bear can\nsmell out a dead seal 20 km away and a bloodhound can distinguish between the trails\nof different people although it may sometimes be confused by the criss-crossing trail of\nidentical twins.\nSnakes and lizards detect odours by means of Jacobson\u2019s organ . This is situated on the\nroof of the mouth and consists of pits containing sensory cells. When snakes flick out their\nforked tongues they are smelling the air by carrying the molecules in it to the Jacobson\u2019s\norgan.\n15.8 Taste\nThe sense of taste allows animals to detect and identify dissolved chemicals. In reptiles,\nbirds, and mammals the taste receptors (taste buds ) are found mainly to the upper\nsurface of the tongue. They consist of pits containing sensory cells arranged rather like the\nsegments of an orange (see diagram 15.3). Each receptor cell has a tiny \u201chair\u201d that projects\ninto the saliva to sense the chemicals dissolved in it.\n208 Sight\nFigure 155\nDiagram 15.3. Taste buds on the tongue\nThe sense of taste is quite restricted. Humans can only distinguish four different tastes\n(sweet, sour, bitter and salt) and what we normally think of as taste is mainly the sense of\nsmell. Food is quite tasteless when the nose is blocked and cats often refuse to eat when\nthis happens.\n15.9 Sight\nThe eyes are the organs of sight. They consist of spherical eyeballs situated in deep\ndepressions in the skull called the orbits . They are attached to the wall of the orbit by\nsix muscles, which move the eyeball. Upper and lower eyelids cover the eyes during sleep\nand protect them from foreign objects or too much light, and spread the tears over their\nsurface.\nThe nictitating membrane or haw is a transparent sheet that moves sideways across the\neye from the inner corner, cleansing and moistening the cornea without shutting out the\nlight. It is found in birds, crocodiles, frogs and fish as well as marsupials like the kangaroo.\nIt is rare in mammals but can be seen in cats and dogs by gently opening the eye when it\nis asleep. Eyelashes also protect the eyes from the sun and foreign objects.\n15.9.1 Structure of the Eye\nLining the eyelids and covering the front of the eyeball is a thin epithelium called the\nconjunctiva . Conjunctivitis is inflammation of this membrane. Tear glands that open\njust under the top eyelid secrete a salty solution that keeps the exposed part of the eye\nmoist, washes away dust and contains an enzyme that destroys bacteria.\n209 The Senses\nThe wall of the eyeball is composed of three layers (see diagram 15.4). From the outside\nthese are the sclera , the choroid and the retina .\nFigure 156\nDiagram 15.4 - The structure of the eye\nThe sclera is a tough fibrous layer that protects the eyeball and gives it rigidity. At the\nfront of the eye the sclera is visible as the \u201cwhite \u201d of the eye, which is modified as the\ntransparent cornea through which the light rays have to pass to enter the eye. The cornea\nhelps focus light that enters the eye.\nThe choroid lies beneath the sclera. It contains a network of blood vessels that supply\nthe eye with oxygen and nutrients. Its inner surface is highly pigmented and absorbs stray\nlight rays. In nocturnal animals like the cat and possum this highly pigmented layer reflects\nlight as a means of conserving light. This is what makes them shine when caught in car\nheadlights.\nAt the front of the eye the choroid becomes the iris . This is the coloured part of the eye\nthat controls the amount of light entering the pupil of the eye. In dim light the pupil is\nwide open so as much light as possible enters while in bright light the pupils contract to\nprotect the retina from damage by excess light.\nThe pupil in most animals is circular but in many nocturnal animals it is a slit that can\nclose completely. This helps protect the extra-sensitive light sensing tissues of animals like\nthe cat and possum from bright sunlight.\nThe inner layer lining the inside of the eye is the retina . This contains the light sensing\ncells called rods and cones (see diagram 15.5).\nTherod cellsarelongandfatandaresensitivetodimlightbutcannotdetectcolour. They\ncontainlargeamountsofapigmentthatchangeswhenexposedtolight. Thispigmentcomes\n210 Sight\nfrom vitamin A found in carrots etc. A deficiency of this vitamin causes night blindness.\nSo your mother was right when she told you to eat your carrots as they would help you see\nin the dark!\nThe cone cells provide colour vision and allow animals to see details. Most are found in\nthe centre of the retina and they are most densely concentrated in a small area called the\nfovea . This is the area of sharpest vision, where the words you are reading at this moment\nare focussed on your retina.\nFigure 157\nDiagram 15.5 - A rod and cone from the retina\n211 The Senses\nThe nerve fibres from the cells of the retina join and leave the eye via the optic nerve .\nThere are no rods or cones here and it is a blind spot . The optic nerve passes through\nthe back of the orbit and enters the brain.\nThe lens is situated just behind the pupil and the iris. It is a crystalline structure with\nno blood vessels and is held in position by a ligament. This is attached to a muscle, which\nchanges the shape of the lens so both near and distant objects can be focussed by the eye.\nThis ability to change the focus of the lens is called accommodation . In many mammals\nthe muscles that bring about accommodation are poorly developed, Rats, cows and dogs,\nfor example, are thought to be unable to focus clearly on near objects.\nIn old age and certain diseases the lens may become cloudy resulting in blurred vision. This\nis called a cataract . Within the eyeball are two cavities, the anterior and posterior\nchambers , separated by the lens. They contain fluids the aqueous and vitreous hu-\nmours respectively, that maintain the shape of the eyeball and help press the retina firmly\nagainst the choroid so clear images are seen.\n15.9.2 How The Eye Sees\nEyes work quite like a camera. Light rays from an object enter the eye and are focused on\nthe retina (the \u201cfilm\u201d) at the back of the eye. The cornea, the lens and the fluid within the\neye all help to focus the light. They do this by bending the light rays so that light from the\nobject falls on the retina. This bending of light is called refraction . The light stimulates\nthe light sensitive cells of the retina and nerve impulses are produced that pass down the\noptic nerve to the brain (see diagram 15.6).\nFigure 158\nDiagram 15.6 - How the light travels from the object to the retina of the eye\n212 Sight\n15.9.3 Colour Vision In Animals\nAs mentioned before, the retina has two different kinds of cells that are stimulated by light\n- rods and cones . In humans and higher primates like baboons and gorillas the rods\nfunction in dim light and do not perceive colour, while the cones are stimulated by bright\nlight and perceive details and colour.\nOther mammals have very few cones in their retinas and it is believed that they see no or\nonly a limited range of colour. It is, of course, difficult to find out exactly what animals\ndo see. It is thought that deer, rats, and rabbits and nocturnal animals like the cat are\ncolour-blind, and dogs probably see green and blue. Some fish and most birds seem to have\nbetter colour vision than humans and they use colour, often very vivid ones, for recognizing\neach other as well as for courtship and protection.\n15.9.4 Binocular Vision\nAnimals like cats that hunt have eyes placed on the front of the head in such a way that\nboth eyes see the same wide area but from slightly different angles (see diagram 15.7). This\nis called binocular vision. Its main advantage is that it enables the animals to\nestimate the distance to the prey so they can chase it and pounce accurately.\nFigure 159\nDiagram 15.7 - Well developed binocular vision in predator animals like the cat\nIncontrastplant-eatingpreyanimalsliketherabbitanddeerneedtohaveawidepanoramic\nview so they can see predators approaching. They therefore have eyes placed on the side of\nthe head, each with its own field of vision (see diagram 15.8). They have only a very small\narea of binocular vision in front of the head but are extremely sensitive to movement.\n213 The Senses\nFigure 160\nDiagram 15.8 - Panoramic monocular vision in prey animals like the rabbit\n15.10 Hearing\nAnimals use the sense of hearing for many different purposes. It is used to sense danger\nandenemies, todetectprey, toidentifyprospectivematesandtocommunicatewithinsocial\ngroups. Some animals (e.g. most bats and dolphins) use sound to \u201csee\u201d by echolocation. By\nsending out a cry and interpreting the echo, they sense obstacles or potential prey.\n15.10.1 Structure of the Ear\nMostoftheear, theorganofhearing, ishiddenfromviewwithintheboneyskull. Itconsists\nof three main regions: the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (see diagram\n15.9).\n214 Hearing\nFigure 161\nDiagram 15.9 - The ear\nThe outer ear consists of an ear canal leading inwards to a thin membrane known as\nthe eardrum or tympanic membrane that stretches across the canal. Many animals\nhave an external ear flap or pinna to collect and funnel the sound into the ear canal. The\npinnae (plural of pinna) usually face forwards on the head but many animals can swivel\nthem towards the source of the sound.\nIn dogs the ear canal is long and bent and often traps wax or provides an ideal habitat for\nmites, yeast and bacteria.\nThe middle ear consists of a cavity in the skull that is connected to the pharynx (throat)\nby a long narrow tube called the Eustachian tube . This links the middle ear to the\noutside air so that the air pressure on both sides of the eardrum can be kept the same.\nEveryone knows the uncomfortable feeling (and affected hearing) that occurs when you\ndrive down a steep hill and the unequal air pressures on the two sides of the eardrum cause\nit to distort. The discomfort is relieved when you swallow because the Eustachian tubes\nopen and the pressure on either side equalises.\nWithinthecavityofthemiddleeararethreeofthesmallestbonesinthebody,theauditory\nossicles . They are known as the hammer, the anvil and the stirrup because of their\nresemblance to the shape of these objects. These tiny bones articulate (move against) each\nother and transfer the vibrations of the eardrum to the membrane covering the opening to\nthe inner ear.\nTheinner earisacomplicatedseriesoffluid-filledtubesimbeddedintheboneoftheskull.\nIt consists of two main parts. These are the cochlea where sound waves are converted to\nnerve impulses and the vestibular organ that is associated with the sense of balance and\nhas no role in hearing (see later).\n215 The Senses\nThe cochlea looks rather like a coiled up snail shell. Within it there are specialised cells\nwithfinehairsontheirsurfacethatrespondtothemovementofthefluidwithinthecochlea\nby producing nervous impulses that travel to the brain along the auditory nerve .\n15.10.2 How The Ear Hears\nSound waves can be thought of as vibrations in the air. They are collected by the ear pinna\nand pass down the ear canal where they cause the eardrum to vibrate. (An interesting fact\nis that when you are listening to someone speaking your eardrum vibrates at exactly the\nsame rate as the vocal cords of the person speaking to you).\nThe vibration of the eardrum sets the three tiny bones in the middle ear moving against\neach other so that the vibration is transferred to the membrane covering the opening to\nthe inner ear. As well as transferring the vibration, the tiny ear bones also amplify it. The\nthree tiny bones are called the stirrup, anvil, and hammer. They were called such of their\nform. Inthehumanearthisamplificationisabout20timeswhileindesert-dwellinganimals\nlike the kangaroo rat it is 100 times. This acute hearing warns them of the approach of\npredators like owls and snakes, even in the dark.\nThe vibration causes waves in the fluid in the inner ear that pass down the cochlea. These\nwaves stimulate the tiny hair cells to produce nerve impulses that travel via the auditory\nnerve to the cerebral cortex of the brain where they are interpreted as sound.\nTo summarise: The route sound waves take as they pass through the ear is: External ear\n| tympanic membrane | ear ossicles | inner ear |cochlear | hair cells\nThe hair cells generate a nerve impulse that travels down the auditory nerve to the brain.\nRemember that sound waves do not pass along the Eustachian tube. Its function is to\nequalise the air pressure on either side of the tympanic membrane.\n15.11 Balance\nThe vestibular organ of the inner ear helps an animal maintain its posture and keep\nbalancedbymonitoringthemovementandpositionofthehead. Itconsistsoftwostructures\n- the semicircular canals and the otolith organs .\nThe semicircular canals (see diagram 15.10) respond to movement of the body. They\ntell an animal whether it is moving up or down, left or right. They consist of three canals\nset in three different planes at right angles to each other so that movement in any direction\ncan be registered. The canals contain fluid and sense cells with fine hairs that project into\nthe fluid. When the head moves the fluid swirls in the canals and stimulates the hair cells.\nThese send nerve impulses along the vestibular nerve to the cerebellum .\nNote that the semicircular canals register acceleration and deceleration as well as changes\nin direction but do not respond to movement that is at a constant speed.\nThe otolith organs are sometimes known as gravity receptors. They tell you if your head\nis tilted or if you are standing on your head. They consist of bulges at the base of the\nsemi circular canals that contain hair cells that are covered by a mass of jelly containing\n216 Summary\ntiny pieces of chalk called otoliths (see diagram 15.10). When the head is tilted, or moved\nsuddenly, the otoliths pull on the hair cells, which produce a nerve impulse. This travels\ndown the vestibular nerve to the cerebellum . By coordinating the nerve impulses from\nthe semicircular canals and otolith organs the cerebellum helps the animal keep its balance.\nFigure 162\nDiagram 15.10 - Otolith Organs\n15.12 Summary\n\u2022 Receptors for touch, pressure, pain and temperature are found in the skin. Receptors in\nthe muscles, tendons and joints inform the brain of limb position.\n\u2022 The olfactory organ in the nose responds to chemicals in the air i.e. smell.\n\u2022 Taste buds on the tongue respond to a limited range of chemicals dissolved in saliva.\n\u2022 The eyes are the organs of sight. Spherical eyeballs situated in orbits in the skull have\nwalls composed of 3 layers.\n\u2022 The tough outer sclera protects and holds the shape of the eyeball. At the front it\nbecomes visible as the white of the eye and the transparent cornea that allows light to\nenter the eye.\n\u2022 The middle layer is the choroid . It most animals it absorbs stray light rays but in\nnocturnal animal it is reflective to conserve light. At the front of the eye it becomes the\niris with muscles to control the size of the pupil and hence the amount of light entering\nthe eye.\n\u2022 The inner layer is the retina containing the light receptor cells: the rods for black and\nwhite vision in dim light and the cones for colour and detailed vision. Nerve impulses\ngenerated by these cells leave the eye for the brain via the optic nerve .\n\u2022 The lens (with the cornea) helps focus the light rays on the retina. Muscles alter the\nshape of the lens to allow near and far objects to be focussed.\n217 The Senses\n\u2022 Aqueous humour fills the space immediately behind the cornea and keeps it in shape\nand vitreous humour , a transparent jelly-like substance, fills the space behind the lens\nallowing light rays to pass through to the retina.\n\u2022 The ear is the organ of hearing and balance.\n\u2022 The external pinna helps funnel sound waves into the ear and locate the direction of the\nsound. The sound waves travel down the external ear canal to the eardrum or tym-\npanic membrane causing it to vibrate. This vibration is transferred to the auditory\nossicles of the middle ear which themselves transfer it to the inner ear. Here receptors\nin the cochlea respond by generating nerve impulses that travel to the brain via the\nauditory (acoustic) nerve.\n\u2022 The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the pharynx to equalise air pressure\non either side of the tympanic membrane.\n\u2022 The vestibular organ of the inner ear is concerned with maintaining balance and pos-\nture. It consists of the semicircular canals and the otolith organs .\n15.13 Worksheet\nSenses Worksheet1\n15.14 Test Yourself\n1. Where are the organs that sense pain, pressure and temperature found?\n2.

The\nnervous and endocrine systems both work together to bring about this adaptation. In\ngeneral the nervous system responds rapidly to short-term changes by sending electrical\nimpulses along nerves and the endocrine system brings about longer-term adaptations by\nsending out chemical messengers called hormones into the blood stream.\nFor example, think about what happens when a male and female cat meet under your\nbedroom window at night. The initial response of both cats may include spitting, fighting\nand spine tingling yowling - all brought about by the nervous system. Fear and stress then\nactivates the adrenal glands to secrete the hormone adrenaline which increases the heart\nand respiratory rates. If mating occurs, other hormones stimulate the release of ova from\nthe ovary of the female and a range of different hormones maintains pregnancy, delivery of\nthe kittens and lactation.\n16.3 Endocrine Glands And Hormones\nHormones are chemicals that are secreted by endocrine glands . Unlike exocrine glands\n(see chapter 5), endocrine glands have no ducts, but release their secretions directly into\nthe blood system, which carries them throughout the body. However, hormones only affect\nthe specific target organs that recognize them. For example, although it is carried to\nvirtually every cell in the body, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), released from the\nanterior pituitary gland , only acts on the follicle cells of the ovaries causing them to\ndevelop.\nA nerve impulse travels rapidly and produces an almost instantaneous response but one\nthat lasts only briefly. In contrast, hormones act more slowly and their effects may be long\nlasting. Target cells respond to minute quantities of hormones and the concentration in\nthe blood is always extremely low. However, target cells are sensitive to subtle changes in\n222 The Pituitary Gland And Hypothalamus\nhormone concentration and the endocrine system regulates processes by changing the rate\nof hormone secretion.\nThe main endocrine glands in the body are the pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid\n, and adrenal glands , the pancreas, ovaries and testes . Their positions in the body\nare shown in diagram 16.1.\nFigure 165\nDiagram 16.1 - The main endocrine organs of the body\n16.4 The Pituitary Gland And Hypothalamus\nThe pituitary gland is a pea-sized structure that is attached by a stalk to the underside\nof the cerebrum of the brain (see diagram 16.2). It is often called the \u201cmaster\u201d endocrine\ngland because it controls many of the other endocrine glands in the body. However, we\nnow know that the pituitary gland is itself controlled by the hypothalamus . This small\nbut vital region of the brain lies just above the pituitary and provides the link between the\nnervous and endocrine systems. It controls the autonomic nervous system , produces a\nrange of hormones and regulates the secretion of many others from the pituitary gland (see\nChapter 7 for more information on the hypothalamus).\nThe pituitary gland is divided into two parts with different functions - the anterior and\nposterior pituitary (see diagram 16.3).\n223 Endocrine System\nFigure 166\nDiagram 16.2 - The position of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus\nFigure 167\nDiagram 16.3 - The anterior and posterior pituitary\nThe anterior pituitary gland secretes hormones that regulate a wide range of activities\nin the body. These include:\n1. Growth hormone that stimulates body growth.\n2. Prolactin that initiates milk production.\n3. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH ) that stimulates the development of the folli-\ncles of the ovaries. These then secrete oestrogen (see chapter 6).\n4. melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH ) that causes darkening of skin by pro-\nducing melanin\n5. lutenizing hormone (LH ) that stimulates ovulation and production of progesterone\nand testosterone\n224 The Pineal Gland\n16.5 The Pineal Gland\nThepineal glandisfounddeepwithinthebrain(seediagram16.4).

It produces the hormone thyroxine , which influences the rate of growth\nand development of young animals. In mature animals it increases the rate of chemical\nreactions in the body.\nThyroxineconsistsof60%iodineandtoolittleinthedietcancausegoitre,anenlargement\nof the thyroid gland. Many inland soils in New Zealand contain almost no iodine so goitre\ncan be common in stock when iodine supplements are not given. To add to the problem,\nchemicals called goitrogens that occur naturally in plants like kale that belong to the\ncabbage family , can also cause goitre even when there is adequate iodine available.\n225 Endocrine System\nFigure 169\nDiagram 16.5 - The thyroid and parathyroid glands\n16.7 The Parathyroid Glands\nThe parathyroid glands are also found in the neck just behind the thyroid glands (see\ndiagram 16.5). They produce the hormone parathormone that regulates the amount of\ncalcium in the blood and influences the excretion of phosphates in the urine.\n16.8 The Adrenal Gland\nThe adrenal glands are situated on the cranial surface of the kidneys (see diagram 16.6).\nThere are two parts to this endocrine gland, an outer cortex and an inner medulla .\n226 The Pancreas\nFigure 170\nDiagram 16.6 - The adrenal glands\nThe adrenal cortex produces several hormones. These include:\n1. Aldosteronethatregulatestheconcentrationofsodium and potassiumintheblood\nby controlling the amounts that are secreted or reabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\n2. Cortisoneandhydrocortisone(cortisol)thathavecomplexeffectsonglucose,protein\nandfatmetabolism. Ingeneraltheyincreasemetabolism. Theyarealsooftenadministered\nto animals to counteract allergies and for treating arthritic and rheumatic conditions.\nHowever, prolonged use should be avoided if possible as they can increase weight and\nreduce the ability to heal.\n3. Male and female sex hormones similar to those secreted by the ovaries and testes.\nThe hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex also play a part in \u201cgeneral adaptation\nsyndrome \u201d which occurs in situations of prolonged stress.\nTheadrenal medullasecretesadrenalin(alsocalledepinephrine). Adrenalinisrespon-\nsible for the so-called flight fight, fright response that prepares the animal for emergencies.\nFaced with a perilous situation the animal needs to either fight or make a rapid escape. To\ndo either requires instant energy, particularly in the skeletal muscles. Adrenaline increases\nthe amount of blood reaching them by causing their blood vessels to dilate and the heart\nto beat faster. An increased rate of breathing increases the amount of oxygen in the blood\nand glucose is released from the liver to provide the fuel for energy production. Sweating\nincreases to keep the muscles cool and the pupils of the eye dilate so the animal has a\nwide field of view. Functions like digestion and urine production that are not critical to\nimmediate survival slow down as blood vessels to these parts constrict.\nNote that the effects of adrenalin are similar to those of the sympathetic nervous system.\n16.9 The Pancreas\nIn most animals the pancreas is an oblong, pinkish organ that lies in the first bend of\nthe small intestine (see diagram 16.7). In rodents and rabbits, however, it is spread thinly\nthrough the mesentery and is sometimes difficult to see.\n227 Endocrine System\nFigure 171\nDiagram 16.7 - The pancreas\nMost of the pancreas acts as an exocrine gland producing digestive enzymes that are\nsecreted into the small intestine. The endocrine part of the organ consists of small clusters\nof cells (called Islets of Langerhans ) that secrete the hormone insulin . This hormone\nregulates the amount of glucose in the blood by increasing the rate at which glucose is\nconverted to glycogen in the liver and the movement of glucose from the blood into cells.\nIn diabetes mellitus the pancreas produces insufficient insulin and glucose levels in the\nblood can increase to a dangerous level. A major symptom of this condition is glucose in\nthe urine.\n16.10 The Ovaries\nThe ovaries, located in the lower abdomen, produce two important sex hormones.\n1. The follicle cells , under the influence of FSH (see the pituitary gland above), pro-\nduce oestrogen , which stimulates the development of female sexual characteristics - the\nmammary glands, generally smaller build of female animals etc. It also stimulates the\nthickening of the lining of the uterus in preparation for pregnancy (see chapter 13).\n2. Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum , the endocrine gland that develops\nin the empty follicle following ovulation (see chapter 13). It promotes the further prepara-\ntion of the uterine lining for pregnancy and prevents the uterus contracting until the baby\nis born.\n228 The Testes\n16.11 The Testes\nCells around the sperm producing ducts of the testis produce the hormone testosterone\n. This stimulates the development of the male reproductive system and the male sexual\ncharacteristics - generally larger body of male animals, mane in lions, tusks in boars, etc\n16.12 Summary\n\u2022 Hormones are chemicals that are released into the blood by endocrine glands i.e.\nGlands with no ducts. Hormones act on specific target organs that recognize them.\n\u2022 The main endocrine glands in the body are the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal,\nthyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, the pancreas, ovaries and testes .\n\u2022 Thehypothalamusissituatedunderthecerebrumofthebrain. Itproducesorcontrols\nmany of the hormones released by the pituitary gland lying adjacent to it.\n\u2022 The pituitary gland is divided into two parts: the anterior pituitary and the poste-\nrior pituitary .\n\u2022 The anterior pituitary produces:\n\u2022 Growth hormone that stimulates body growth\n\u2022 Prolactin that initiates milk production\n\u2022 Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH ) that stimulates the development of ova\n\u2022 Luteinising hormone (LH ) that stimulates the development of the corpus luteum\n\u2022 Plus several other hormones\n\u2022 The posterior pituitary releases:\n\u2022 Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that regulates water loss and raises blood pressure\n\u2022 Oxytocin that stimulates milk \u201clet down\u201d.\n\u2022 The pineal gland in the brain produces melatonin that influences sexual develop-\nment and breeding cycles .\n\u2022 The thyroid gland located in the neck, produces thyroxine, which influences the rate\nof growth and development of young animals. Thyroxine consists of 60% iodine .\nLack of iodine leads to goitre .\n\u2022 The parathyroid glands situated adjacent to the thyroid glands in the neck produce\nparathormone that regulates blood calcium levels and the excretion of phosphates .\n\u2022 The adrenal gland located adjacent to the kidneys is divided into the outer cortex and\nthe inner medulla .\n\u2022 The adrenal cortex produces:\n\u2022 Aldosterone that regulates the blood concentration of sodium and potassium\n\u2022 Cortisone and hydrocortisone that affect glucose, protein and fat metabolism\n\u2022 Male and female sex hormones\n\u2022 The adrenal medulla produces adrenalin responsible for the flight, fright, fight\nresponse that prepares animals for emergencies.\n\u2022 The pancreas that lies in the first bend of the small intestine producesinsulin that\nregulates blood glucose levels.\n\u2022 The ovaries are located in the lower abdomen produce 2 important sex hormones:\n229 Endocrine System\n\u2022 The follicle cells of the developing ova produce oestrogen , which controls the devel-\nopment of the mammary glands and prepares the uterus for pregnancy.\n\u2022 The corpus luteum that develops in the empty follicle after ovulation produces pro-\ngesterone . This hormone further prepares the uterus for pregnancy and maintains\nthe pregnancy.\n\u2022 The testes produce testosterone that stimulates the development of the male repro-\nductive system and sexual characteristics .\n16.13 Homeostasis and Feedback Control\nAnimals can only survive if the environment within their bodies and their cells is kept\nconstant and independent of the changing conditions in the external environment. As\nmentioned in module 1.6, the process by which this stability is maintained is called home-\nostasis. The body achieves this stability by constantly monitoring the internal conditions\nand if they deviate from the norm initiating processes that bring them back to it. This\nmechanism is called feedback control. For example, to maintain a constant body tempera-\nturethehypothalamusmonitorsthebloodtemperatureandinitiatesprocessesthatincrease\nordecreaseheatproductionbythebodyandlossfromtheskinsotheoptimumtemperature\nis always maintained. The processes involved in the control of body temperature, water\nbalance, blood loss and acid/base balance are summarized below.\n16.14 Summary of Homeostatic Mechanisms\n16.14.1 1. Temperature control\nThe biochemical and physiological processes in the cell are sensitive to temperature. The\noptimum body temperature is about 37\uffffC [99\uffffF] for mammals, and about 40\uffffC [104\uffffF]\nfor birds. Biochemical processes in the cells, particularly in muscles and the liver, produce\nheat. The heat is distributed through the body by the blood and is lost mainly through the\nskin surface. The production of this heat and its loss through the skin is controlled by the\nhypothalamus in the brain which acts rather like a thermostat on an electric heater. .\n(a) When the body temperature rises above the optimum, a decrease in temperature is\nachieved by:\n\u2022 Sweating and panting to increase heat loss by evaporation.\n\u2022 Expansion of the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat is lost to the air.\n\u2022 Reducing muscle exertion to the minimum.\n(b) When the body temperature falls below the optimum, an increase in temperature can\nbe achieved by:\n\u2022 Moving to a heat source e.g. in the sun, out of the wind.\n\u2022 Increasing muscular activity\n230 Summary of Homeostatic Mechanisms\n\u2022 Shivering\n\u2022 Making the hair stand on end by contraction of the hair erector muscles or fluffing of the\nfeathers so there is an insulating layer of air around the body\n\u2022 Constricting the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat loss to the air is decreased\n16.14.2 2. Water balance\nThe concentration of the body fluids remains relatively constant irrespective of the diet or\nthe quantity of water taken into the body by the animal. Water is lost from the body by\nmany routes (see module 1.6) but the kidney is the main organ that influences the quantity\nthat is lost. Again it is the hypothalamus that monitors the concentration of the blood\nand initiates the release of hormones from the posterior pituitary gland. These act on the\nkidney tubules to influence the amount of water (and sodium ions) absorbed from the fluid\nflowing along them.\n(a)Whenthebodyfluidsbecometooconcentratedandtheosmoticpressuretoohigh,water\nretention in the kidney tubules can be achieved by:\n\u2022 An increased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary\ngland, which causes more water to be reabsorbed from the kidney tubules.\n\u2022 A decreased blood pressure in the glomerulus of the kidney results in less fluid filtering\nthrough into the kidney tubules so less urine is produced.\n(b) When the body fluids become too dilute and the osmotic pressure too low, water loss\nin the urine can be achieved by:\n\u2022 A decrease in the secretion of ADH, so less water is reabsorbed from the kidney tubules\nand more diluted urine is produced.\n\u2022 An increase in the blood pressure in the glomerulus so more fluid filters into the kidney\ntubule and more urine is produced.\n\u2022 An increase in sweating or panting that also increases the amount of water lost.\nAnotherhormone,aldosterone,secretedbythecortexoftheadrenalgland,alsoaffectswater\nbalance indirectly. It does this by increasing the absorption of sodium ions (Na-) from the\nkidney tubules. This increases water retention since it increases the osmotic pressure of the\nfluids around the tubules and water therefore flows out of them by osmosis.\n16.14.3 3. Maintenance of blood volume after moderate blood loss\nLoss of blood or body fluids leads to decreased blood volume and hence decreased blood\npressure. The result is that the blood system fails to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients\ntothecells, whichstopfunctioningproperlyandmaydie. Cellsofthebrainareparticularly\nvulnerable. This condition is known as shock.\nIf blood loss is not extreme, various mechanisms come into play to compensate and ensure\npermanent tissue damage does not occur. These mechanisms include:\n231 Endocrine System\n\u2022 Increased thirst and drinking increases blood volume.\n\u2022 Blood vessels in the skin and kidneys constrict to reduce the total volume of the blood\nsystem and hence retain blood pressure.\n\u2022 Heart rate increases. This also increases blood pressure.\n\u2022 Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released by the posterior pituitary gland. This increases\nwater re-absorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney tubules so concentrated urine is\nproduced and water loss is reduced. This helps maintain blood volume.\n\u2022 Lossoffluidcausesanincreaseinosmoticpressureoftheblood. Proteins,mainlyalbumin,\nreleased into the blood by the liver further increase the osmotic pressure causing fluid\nfrom the tissues to be drawn into the blood by osmosis. This increases blood volume.\n\u2022 Aldosterone,secretedbytheadrenalcortex,increasestheabsorptionofsodiumions(Na-)\nand water from the kidney tubules. This increases urine concentration and helps retain\nblood volume.\nIf blood or fluid loss is extreme and the blood volume falls by more than 15-25%, the\nabove mechanisms are unable to compensate and the condition of the animal progressively\ndeteriorates. The animal will die unless a vet administers fluid or blood.\n16.14.4 4. Acid/ base balance\nBiochemical reactions within the body are very sensitive to even small changes in acidity\nor alkalinity (i.e. pH) and any departure from the narrow limits disrupts the functioning of\nthe cells. It is therefore important that the blood contains balanced quantities of acids and\nbases.\nThe normal pH of blood is in the range 7.35 to 7.45 and there are a number of mechanisms\nthat operate to maintain the pH in this range. Breathing is one of these mechanisms.\nMuch of the carbon dioxide produced by respiration in cells is carried in the blood as\ncarbonic acid. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood increases the blood becomes\nmore acidic and the pH decreases. This is called acidosis and when severe can cause coma\nand death. On the other hand, alkalosis (blood that is too alkaline) causes over stimulation\nof the nervous system and when severe can lead to convulsions and death.\n(a) When vigorous activity generating large quantities of carbon dioxide causes the blood\nto becomes too acidic it can be counteracted in two ways:\n\u2022 By the rapid removal of carbon dioxide from the blood by deep, panting breaths\nBy the secretion of hydrogen ions (H+) into the urine by the kidney tubules.\n(b) When over breathing or hyperventilation results in low levels of carbon dioxide in the\nblood and the blood is too alkaline, various mechanisms come into play to bring the pH\nback to within the normal range. These include:\n\u2022 A slower rate of breathing\n\u2022 A reduction in the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) secreted into the urine.\n232 Worksheet\n16.14.5 SUMMARY\nHomeostasisisthemaintenanceofconstantconditionswithinacelloranimal\u2019sbodydespite\nchanges in the external environment.\nThebodytemperatureofmammalsandbirdsismaintainedatanoptimumlevelbyavariety\nof heat regulation mechanisms.
