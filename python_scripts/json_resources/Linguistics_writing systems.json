We would think it funny if parents hovered over their\nnewborn's crib, chanting the sounds of language one at a time. Parents\nare not trying to teach language, but rather trying to communicate with\ntheir child. They do not teach children individual sounds, but instead, use\nand share language naturally as a part of everyday experiences. They\nrespect and accept their baby's babblings as talk. Although different from\nthat of grown-ups, the child's language is celebrated and accepted\nwithout criticism. It is through constant interaction with family and\nfriends--through using language and hearing others use it in everyday\nsituations--that children learn to talk. Our research has indicated that the\nsame is true of learning to read and write. It is through constant\ninteraction with family and friends. teachers and classmates-- through\nusing reading and writing and observing others reading and writing in\neveryday situations--that children can learn to read and write.\"\n(National Council of Teachers of English, Elementary School\nPractices. 1994 brochure)\n41 Reading\nThe \"Whole Language\" movement - part 2:\n\u2022 English spelling is so full of irregularities, people couldn't\npossibly be attending to all the letters.\n\u2022 Reading is a \"psycho-linguistic guessing game\".\n\u2022 So teaching symbol-sound correspondences (in English at\nleast) is a waste of time.\n42 Reading\nSuccess of \"Whole Language\" in the 1980s\n\"We've begun seriously to affect legislative policy in states like\nMichigan and Kentucky as well as all of the provinces of Canada.\"\n[From a list of achievements of the Whole Language Movement:\nJerome Harste (1993) \"New Questions, Different Inquiries\", in Carl\nB.
