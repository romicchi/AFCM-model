(Science,\nJanuary 1, 1999). Once again, a two-minute stream of synthesized speech was played to the\ninfants. Once again, the speech stream was composed of three-syllable nonsense words, made\nfrom synthesized speech, with no cues identifying the word boundaries.

The infants preferred novel second presentations over familiar\nnizzes 14 33\nsecond presentations. But \"familiar\" here meant -- not containing the same \"words\" -- but\ncontaining new words that followed the old rule. In their words: \"Infants [can] extract abstract\nalgebra-like rules that represent relationships between placeholders (variables), such as \u201cthe Note about 2/3 of the first-graders tested failed to produce adult-like plurals for words that\nfirst item X is the same as the third item Y,\u201d or more generally, that \u201citem I is the same as item\nend in sibilants.
