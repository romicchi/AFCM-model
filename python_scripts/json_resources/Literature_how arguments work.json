{"text":"1.1: Why Study Argument?\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (8 min, 9 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 88::0099\nWhen I was starting college, friends and relatives told me \u201ccollege teaches you to think.\u201d I found this idea both puzzling and\nexciting. It was puzzling of course, because everyone thinks all the time. What was it exactly that we needed to learn? It was\nexciting because it suggested there was a whole other level of skill at thinking. It implied that college was about training the mind,\nnot just about specific areas of expertise. Learning to think would change me and how I approached everything.\nImage by Hans Braxmeier on Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nI imagined that this challenge to my thinking habits would come from the class readings and discussions. What I didn\u2019t know was\nthat the process of writing, the process of developing my own arguments, would challenge me even more and become the core\npractice that stretched my thinking. I use the term \u201cargument\u201d here broadly to mean a presentation of ideas that usually includes\nreasons to support those ideas.\nMost of us are probably familiar with the practical reasons to study writing in college. It\u2019s worth getting good at because we\u2019re\ngoing to do it a lot. No matter our major, as we get into higher-level classes we will need to do more writing, whether that looks\nlike lab reports, explanations of mathematical methods, or essays in psychology, political science, literature, or economics.\nWe probably recognize, too, that writing skills will help us succeed in a career. To get a job, we\u2019ll have to write cover letters,\nresumes, and emails. On the job, we\u2019ll have to explain things to colleagues in writing. Nurses and doctors write notes on patient\ncare; software engineers comment on the structure of their programs, managers write plans and evaluations. In all these settings, a\nprofessional style of Standard English will boost credibility. We will benefit from the ability to switch to this more formal type of\nlanguage from any dialect we speak within our family and community.\nBut why does academia make writing so central? And why do so many professions depend on it? What makes writing so valuable?\nI would argue that academia and the professions need writing because it is our best tool for sharpening our thinking. It helps us\nslow down and clarify our ideas. Humans are not innately great at this. Many psychologists have argued that people tend to make\ndecisions quickly and base them heavily on emotion. In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow Daniel Kahneman the human tendency\ntoward quick reactions and snap judgments with the deeper consideration we need for complex topics (we'll talk more about fast\nand slow thinking and human biases in the next section).\nPhoto by Song Kaiyue from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nPerhaps the highest goal of academia is to advance our understanding as humans. We can think of academia as a conversation of\nmany voices that speak to each other across time and place, through the medium of writing. It\u2019s a good thing that each argument\nbecomes part of this larger conversation because slow thinking is hard. It takes mental sweat. It takes time. We need each other\u2019s\n1.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118718 help and input. Reading, writing, and revising help us get clearer about our own ideas and those of others. These processes demand\neffort from every student and scholar, no matter their IQ, overall knowledge, or experience. And the effort pays off.\nSometimes we need to dive deep to reach the bottom and think slow to arrive at an insight.\nPhoto by Jakob Boman on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nThe slow thinking skills that college cultivates in turn help us as professionals in fields beyond the academy. Reading, writing, and\nrevising allow us to think carefully about each workplace decision, considering multiple factors and perspectives. They enable us to\ncommunicate and explain our decisions to colleagues and respond to their questions and critiques.\nBut slow thinking is not just for academic work and professional life. I believe I was right to get excited when I heard \u201ccollege\nteaches thinking,\u201d because the slow thinking we practice as readers and writers is transformative for our personal lives. Slow\nthinking is a tool for soul searching. High-stakes life questions involve so many complex considerations that they demand extended\nthought. What major and career should I pursue? How much should I work while in school? These questions require research into\nthe options, and a careful weighing of our values and interests, economic pressures, and family demands, as well as our dreams and\ndesires. Even if we end up going with an intuition or first impulse, such decisions are worth confirming with slower thinking. As\nStuart Greene and April Lidinsky put it in From Inquiry to Academic Writing, \u201c[L]earning to consider information carefully and\ncritically, and to weigh competing points of view before making our own judgments--gives us power over our own lives\u201d (11).\nArgument can help us gain power in society as well. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, authors of A Rhetoric of Argument, go so\nfar as to see it as a tool \"to equalize the unequal distribution of power that exists in every institution and situation\" (8). Those of us\nwho don\u2019t start out with power can build it by arguing well about the issues that matter to us and our communities. The habits of\nmind we learn as readers and writers can help us develop our political opinions. Our participation in democracy, whether that\nmeans voting or any kind of political activity, local or national, requires myriad decisions on very complex issues. Which drugs\nshould be legal? How should we address climate change? How should we ensure public safety? How much money should the\ngovernment take from citizens, and how should it spend that money? How do we move toward a more just society? These big\nquestions involve countless smaller ones that require ongoing debate and consideration.\nSlow thinking doesn\u2019t come easily, even for supposed experts. As writers and thinkers, we will all feel at times that we are\nstruggling in the dark. In writing this introduction, I have had to remind myself several times: \u201cJust keep writing; it will eventually\ncome together;\u201d \u201cThe ideas are always foggy at first;\u201d \u201cGive yourself permission to write a shitty first draft;\u201d \u201cRemember, a bad\nfirst draft!\u201d and other mantras. I remind myself of the many times I have been through this and the \u201caha\u201d moments that came along\nthe way. I remind myself that when I keep working, I eventually make it through the short-term frustration and gain increased\nclarity.\nEven though slow thinking never gets easy, it does get easier. There are specific moves we can learn that will help a great deal. We\npick up these moves unconsciously from other writers as we read. But we can also learn them directly. This textbook points out the\ncommon moves writers make as they develop arguments. It shows how to recognize these moves as we read and how to make\nsimilar moves as we write.\n1.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118718 Photo by The Creative Exchange on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nAttributions\nWritten by Anna Mills, with discussion of fast and slow thinking were adapted by Anna Mills from \u201cThinking Fast and Slow\u201d by\nAlex Sterling, included in \"Critical Thinking for the 21st Century\" on Canvas Commons, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.\n1.1: Why Study Argument? is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n1.1.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118718 1.2: A Closer Look at Fast and Slow Thinking\nLook at this picture, and notice your first reaction. Do you have an emotional reaction, good or bad? What is your opinion right off\nthe bat? Going with your gut, what do you think? Notice I am asking you about two things: (1) your emotional reaction and (2)\nyour first thought.\nImage by Rhododentrites on Wikimedia Commons, licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.\nIf you are a Dreamer yourself or if you have DACA protection or you were brought to the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant as a\nchild, you probably agree (your first thought) and your emotional reaction might be something like, \u201cYeah!\u201d Even if you are not a\nDreamer, you may have a similar positive reaction. If you haven't thought too much about Dreamers before or are unfamiliar with\nthe issues surrounding them, you might be tempted to still respond positively because of the positive word \"Dreamer\" and the\nappeal to America's greatness. Or, if you lean to the right politically and are familiar with right-wing rhetoric on immigration, you\nmay have the opposite reaction: you disagree with the protester and react negatively, something like, \u201cthis is BS!\u201d\nThis instant reaction, your gut feeling and first thought, we will call \u201cfast thinking.\u201d In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel\nKahneman presents evidence from psychology about how the human mind works. Your quick reaction to the photo is what\nKahneman calls fast thinking, which is quick, automatic, and little effort is involved. Other examples of fast thinking: looking up\nwhen you hear a loud noise, saying \u201cfine\u201d when someone says \u201chow are you,\u201d or finishing 2 + 2 = ___. In contrast, slow thinking\ntakes time and effort. When you tell someone your phone number, park a car in a small spot, figure out 24 x 17 = _____, or write\nan essay for English, you must do slow thinking. As a human being, we do both fast and slow thinking every day. In this chapter,\nwe will analyze the photo to explore the ways that people think fast and slow and to see how academic slow thinking approaches\nmight lead to better understanding of the issues raised in the photo.\nFast thinking and emotion\n\u201cI have a bad feeling about this.\u201d - Han Solo\nLet\u2019s start with the idea of emotion and fast thinking. In the U.S., illegal immigration is an emotional issue, and psychologists have\nfound that people often make decisions based on their emotions. In The Righteous Mind, Jonathan Haidt argues that people make\nmoral decisions, make up their minds about right and wrong, very fast and largely based on gut feelings. People decide\n\u201cimmediately and emotionally,\u201d and reasoning is \u201cmerely the servant of the passions.\u201d Looking at the photo of the protester with a\nsign saying, \u201cDreamers make America great,\u201d we will decide what we think fast and based largely on emotion. We don\u2019t\nimmediately do slow thinking; we don\u2019t say \u201cI have no opinion; I need to see if there is evidence proving that Dreamers are good\nfor America; show me the stats.\u201d Instead, we decide in an instant based on our feelings.\nIn a way, this is a bad thing: we shouldn\u2019t be so quick to jump to conclusions, and we should examine the evidence! However,\npsychologists have also found that people need their emotions to think clearly. Antonio Damasio and others discovered that people\nwho have lost their ability to feel emotion\u2014based on a brain tumor or injury to the brain\u2014also lose their ability to make rational\ndecisions, and so end up making messes of their lives, losing their jobs and wrecking their marriages. Evidence has been piling up\nthat feelings and reason are linked. We may do bad thinking when we allow emotions to cloud our thinking, but we also need\nemotions to think clearly. Think again about your emotional reaction to the photo, and then ask: are my feelings making me\nirrational, or are they helping me find the truth?\n1.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/220072 Fast thinking and bias\nEven when we are not having an obvious emotional reaction, fast thinking can lead to errors because of bias more generally. We\nmay be the smartest creatures on Earth, but have numerous cognitive biases; that is, there are errors in reasoning that are common\nto all people. For example, we suffer from confirmation bias: we tend to look for evidence that confirms what we already believe,\nand have trouble dealing with anything that goes against what we already believe. Look at the photo again. If you already believed\nthat Dreamers are good young people going to college and they should be allowed to stay in the U.S., then based on confirmation\nbias, your fast thinking will tell you that the protester is right. On the opposing side, if you think illegal immigration is a bad thing\nand Dreamers should be deported, or if you like Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again,\u201d then your fast thinking will be\ndifferent: your confirmation bias will kick in and the photo will confirm all the negative thoughts you have about immigrants and\nliberals.\nImage by Rhododentrites on Wikimedia Commons, licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.\nAnother bias we all carry around is called availability bias: we tend to decide what we think based on the examples, evidence, or\nexperiences we can easily call up in our minds, and based on information we have been exposed to recently. I will use myself as an\nexample here. I am a California community college professor, and I have been teaching in California since the 1990s. That means I\nhave had countless Dreamers in my classes, I have known thousands students who are immigrants or whose parents are\nimmigrants, and most of the immigrants I meet are college students. I can easily call to mind many examples of young people,\nsome of whom are immigrants or Dreamers, who are going to college and contributing to society in the most positive ways, so\nbased on my availability bias, the evidence easily available to me will lead me to agree with the protester in the photo.\nGoogle \u201ccognitive bias\u201d and you will find there are dozens of different kinds of bias. In this sense of the word \u201cbias,\u201d we are all\nbiased because we are human. When we do fast thinking, we may be on the right track, or we may be in error due to cognitive bias.\nDaniel Kahneman and others have shown that bias is very powerful. Even when presented with evidence showing they are wrong,\nconfirmation bias is so strong that you often get the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d: people will dig in their heels and believe even more strongly\nwhen they are given evidence that contradicts their beliefs. We can overcome our biases, we can do slow thinking and examine the\nevidence and logic, but our brains are hardwired to have bias.\nFast thinking and the \u201cpost-truth era\u201d\nThe information environment of the 2020s encourages fast thinking. Once many people read newspapers daily. Now, many of us\nget daily news and information from social media sources such as TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. As we scroll social\nmedia or the web, images like the photo of the protester appear constantly and in such a large quantity that most of us are exposed\nto hundreds of images, posts, videos, or tweets every day. In this information environment, fast thinking rules: we look for a\nsecond, we read a headline without reading the whole article, we decide to click like or not, we decide to share with friends or not\n\u2014all based on fast thinking, emotion, and our biases.\nCertainly, technology can help us be well-informed, but there are dangers. Unlike traditional media, where there are reporters who\nmajored in journalism, editors, and fact-checkers, anyone can post in social media or on the internet, and often an unreliable source\nlooks just like a reliable one\u2014so how do we know what is true? Moreover, social media, web search engines, and YouTube have\nalgorithms that give you more of what you\u2019ve already looked at, so you may end up in a filter bubble, or echo chamber: only\ninformation and ideas you already agree with (remember confirmation bias?) will appear in your feed. Sometimes social media will\nsuggest new things that are more outrageous or extreme, and studies have found that social media posts are far more likely to go\nviral if they appeal to emotion.\n1.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/220072 In fact, studies of misinformation in the 2016 election season showed that falsehoods spread faster and farther than true stories.\nAmerican politics has become angrier and more divided, and the \u201coutrage\u201d style of political opinion\u2014lots of name-calling, wild\nexaggerations of the views of opponents, and appeals to emotion--has grown in recent decades. On top of all that, we have a\nproblem of trust: more and more Americans do not trust traditional sources of information such as newspapers, government\nresearch agencies, network TV, colleges and universities, and even science itself.\nThe result? There is a lot of BS out there. Misinformation is such a problem that \u201cfake news\u201d is now an ordinary word in the\nU.S.A., and many have argued that we are now in the era of \u201cpost-truth.\u201d In the post-truth era, facts don\u2019t matter, and people make\nup their minds based on emotion, biases, and political loyalty. (For a good summary, see the book, Post-Truth, by Lee McIntyre.)\nAccording to Eric Oliver of the University of Chicago, over half of Americans subscribe to at least one conspiracy theory. About\n10% of Americans still believe that vaccines cause autism even though this claim has been thoroughly debunked. Some Americans\nread and share articles from fake news websites as if they were real. For example, look up America\u2019s Last Line of Defense; this\nwebsite declares itself to be satire, completely made-up stories, but so many people were sharing these stories that Factcheck.org\nfelt the need to debunk stories from this site 24 times. Magazines such as The Atlantic publish stories such as \u201cStop Trusting Viral\nVideos.\u201d If you Google \u201cmisinformation about coronavirus,\u201d you will find many websites devoted to combatting myths and\ndisinformation about Covid 19. And climate change? There is no controversy among scientists, but a significant portion of\nAmericans still believe the problem does not exist or that the science is uncertain. Speaking of established science, surveys show\nthat a large proportion of Americans don\u2019t believe in evolution\u2014again, there is no disagreement here among scientists. Distrust of\nscience is so strong that Sara and Jack Gorman wrote a whole book about science denial called Denying to the Grave: Why We\nIgnore the Facts That Will Save Us.\nPossibly the most dramatic post-truth event of our lifetimes happened in the wake of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Joe Biden\nwon the election with 306 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 232, and Biden won the popular vote by 7 million votes. Voter turnout was\nhigh and it was not a close election (even Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell admitted this). However, Trump\nclaimed with no evidence that the election was stolen. Spurred on by Trump\u2019s falsehoods, supporters stormed the Unites States\nCapitol on January 6, 2021, resulting in five deaths and 140 injuries. And as of April 2021, a poll by Forbes showed that 60% of\nRepublicans still believed Trump\u2019s lie that the election was somehow rigged. In some cases, the spread of a lie may be dangerous to\ndemocracy itself. According to Timothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University and author of On Tyranny, \u201cTo abandon\nfacts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so.\u201d\nWhen American media users in 2020 saw the photo of the protester with a sign about Dreamers, it was in this sort of information\nenvironment. Fast, emotion, and bias are always there, but on top of all that people don\u2019t even agree on the most basic facts, like\nwho won an election.\nThinking fast and slow\u2014in college\nTo summarize so far: looking at the photo of the protester, people will form an opinion immediately based on fast thinking and\nemotion, and under the influence of cognitive bias. We need fast thinking to get through the day\u2014emotions, gut instincts, reflexes,\nintuitions serve us well most of the time\u2014but we need to develop slow thinking too. Let\u2019s go back to our photo of the Dreamer\nprotester and do some slow thinking. Of course, it\u2019s good to notice your fast thinking\u2013your feelings and gut reactions and snap\njudgments\u2013when looking at this picture. But then it\u2019s time to slow down, think it through, do some research.\nOften this begins with defining key terms and clarifying what exactly is being said. The word \u201cDreamer\u201d can be found in any\nonline dictionary, and is usually defined as follows: undocumented immigrant, came to the U.S. as a child, qualifies for the\nDREAM Act. The DREAM Act was first proposed in 2001 but has never been passed by Congress. The act would grant Dreamers\nlegal residency and possibly a path to citizenship if they met a list of qualifications (including \u201cgood moral character\u201d).\n1.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/220072 Image by Rhododentrites on Wikimedia Commons, licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.\nBack to the picture: a young woman is holding a sign saying that \u201cDreamers make America great.\u201d Slow thinking: what does that\nmean? Is this an argument that Dreamers contribute to the economy? That they bring cultural contributions? That they benefit the\nUSA overall? That the way America treats Dreamers should show greatness of heart? We don\u2019t know. Maybe should consider\ncontext. The protesters were in the streets because Trump was going to rescind DACA, a move by Obama that gave temporary\nlegal residency (but not a path to citizenship) to some Dreamers. So maybe the exact words of the sign aren\u2019t the point; maybe the\nreal claim being made is something like: \u201cTrump, you are wrong to rescind DACA!\u201d\nBeyond interpreting the photo, your next slow-thinking move would likely be research, but what research you do would depend on\nyour purpose. As a college student writing a paper or doing a project, this could mean many different things. You could gather\nevidence about people who were brought to the U.S. as undocumented immigrants when they were children: how many are there?\nWhere did they come from? How long have they been here? What percent attend college? What kind of jobs do they have? What\nwould happen to them if they were deported?\nYou could also research DACA itself\u2013what its provisions are, how long it\u2019s been in place, how DACA status is different from\nhaving a green card, and more. In addition to gathering facts, slow thinking might mean examining ethical questions such as this\none: do undocumented people who arrived as children have a moral right to stay and become legal residents or citizens?\nGiven your feelings and biases, some information may confirm your fast thinking, but research can also disappoint. Let\u2019s say your\nfast thinking about the photo was \u201cYes!\u201d You are a college student, your undocumented friend just transferred to UC Berkeley from\nyour community college honors program, and you generally think Dreamers truly are a positive influence on America. But then in\nyour research you find that only a small minority of DACA recipients have attended and graduate from college. Here\u2019s what you\nfound from a 2017 study by the Migration Policy Institute: \u201cWhile DACA recipients are almost as likely as U.S. adults in the same\nage group (15-32) to be enrolled in college (18 percent versus 20 percent), they are far less likely to have completed college (4\npercent versus 18 percent).\u201d Well! What does that show? Do Dreamers have trouble completing college because they lack financial\nresources or aid? Or because they get deported before they can finish? Because of internalized prejudice? Or for some other\nreason? How do they do in comparison to non-immigrants whose parents have the same level of education and economic\nresources? Is college completion a good measure of contribution to society? How should this statistic influence our opinion of\nDreamers and their contribution to America?\nSlow thinking is partly this: realize that it\u2019s complicated, get confused, spend some time thinking about the information and what it\nmeans. And by the time you\u2019ve done all the slow thinking for a college research paper, you\u2019ve changed: your gut reaction isn\u2019t all\nthere is, you have a head full of facts and ideas. You may still have a strong opinion, but you might add, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d You\nhave a lot more to share in conversation about the Dreamers in America, and many more questions to continue exploring.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from \u201cThinking Fast and Slow\u201d by Alex Sterling, included in \"Critical Thinking for the 21st Century\" on\nCanvas Commons, licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\n1.2: A Closer Look at Fast and Slow Thinking is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n1.2.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/220072 1.3: What This Book Offers\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (3 min, 20 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 33::2200\nThis book is meant as a practical guide to college writing. It starts with understanding and describing others' arguments, then moves\non to assessing those arguments\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and articulating our own points in response. These steps will help with\nmost typical college writing assignments that occur across multiple disciplines:\nSummaries describe the ideas in an argument we have read.\nAssessments offer a judgment on how strong the argument is.\nResponse papers make recommendations in response to the strengths or weaknesses of the argument.\nResearch-based arguments describe and assess multiple sources in order to arrive at a new perspective.\nThis book follows that sequence. Chapter 2 describes how to figure out the logical structure of an argument, Chapter 3 explains\nhow to summarize it, and Chapter 4 explores how to test the strength of the argument and make a judgment about it. Chapter 5\nsuggests ways to offer something new in response. Chapter 6 describes how to find and examine multiple sources on a topic, and\nChapter 7 shows how research can lead us to develop an argument of our own.\nMy how-to approach is inspired by Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein's popular text They Say I Say: The Moves That Matter in\nAcademic Writing. They write, \"What makes writers masters of their trade is...their mastery of an inventory of basic moves that\nthey probably picked up by reading a wide range of other accomplished writers.\" Like them, I offer many phrases students can use\nto build original critical responses to texts. I have extended their approach to give more guidance on which phrases to use for which\nargumentative purposes. Graff and Birkenstein question the usefulness of learning \"logical principles of argument\" such as\n\"syllogisms, warrants, fallacies, or the differences between inductive and deductive reasoning.\" However, I argue that we can study\nthe specifics of how to make better arguments without getting bogged down in rhetorical terminology. We can frame many logical\nprinciples in terms of practical templates. For example, this book does not ask students to memorize the term \"post hoc ergo propter\nhoc fallacy,\" but it does teach us to question the assumption that an earlier event causes a later event.\nAs part of preparing students to enter the academic conversation, this book aims to teach how to recognize and use methods of\npersuasion that go beyond logic. I consider that persuasion happens in the context of an imagined relationship between writer and\nreader. Chapter 8 looks at how arguments move us, and Chapter 9 explores how they establish trust and a sense of connection.\nChapter 10, which presents the argument analysis essay, discusses how we can give a picture of an argument as a whole, finding\nconnections between its appeals to emotion and trust and its logical structure. Finally, Chapter 11 considers techniques for shaping\nindividual sentences to make our arguments clearer and more powerful.\nIn the spirit of writing as a conversation, please consider adding your thoughts by writing comments on the textbook in the Student\nFeedback or Instructor Feedback Hypothesis groups. We want to keep improving the book and making it more useful.\nPhoto by Danielle MacInnes on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\n1.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118720 This page titled 1.3: What This Book Offers is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n1.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118720 CHAPTER OVERVIEW\n2: Reading to Figure out the Argument\nLearning Outcomes\nIdentify the main claims of a text as well as the reasons that support those claims.\nIdentify any limits, counterarguments, or rebuttals mentioned in an argument.\nDraw a visual map of the claims, reasons, limits, counterarguments, and rebuttals.\n2.1: Overview: Reading to Write\n2.2: Types of Claims to Look out for\n2.3: Making Notes on the Writer\u2019s Claims\n2.4: Deciding Which Is the Main Claim\n2.5: Finding the Reasons\n2.6: Finding the Counterarguments\n2.7: Finding the Responses to the Counterarguments\n2.8: Finding the Limits on the Argument\n2.9: Common Argument Phrases\nImage courtesy of Pexels.com under the Pexels License.\nThis page titled 2: Reading to Figure out the Argument is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nAnna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n1 2.1: Overview: Reading to Write\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (1 min, 20 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 11::2200\nIn almost every college class, we are asked to read someone else\u2019s writing, explain what that person is arguing, and point out the\nstrengths and weaknesses of their argument. This chapter offers tools for figuring out the structure of an argument and describing it.\nIn later chapters, we will talk about responding to arguments and analyzing how arguments play on emotion and gain the\naudience\u2019s trust.\nSo when you are just trying to get the barebones ideas about something you have read straight, how do you go about it? An\nargument is a swarming cluster of words. How do you get to the heart of it?\nIn this chapter we look at how to take notes not just on the meaning of each part of the argument but also on its relation to the other\nparts. Then we use these notes to draw a visual map of an argument. In the map we see the argument's momentum as the reason\npoints us toward the claim. We see how each element implies, supports, limits, or contradicts other elements. Thus, we begin to\nimagine where the argument is vulnerable and how it might be modified.\nIn Chapter 3, we\u2019ll discuss how to use this logical map to write a summary, and in Chapter 4, we\u2019ll see how to follow up the\nsummary with our own opinions.\n2.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27172 Photo by Jazmin Quaynor on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nThis page titled 2.1: Overview: Reading to Write is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna\nMills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n2.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27172 2.2: Types of Claims to Look out for\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (6 min, 49 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 66::4499\nAs we make notes on what a writer is claiming at each point, it is worth distinguishing what kind of claim they are making.\nClaims of Policy\nThe most familiar kind of argument demands action. It is easy to see when the writer is asking readers to do something. Here are a\nfew phrases that signal a claim of policy, a claim that is pushing readers to do something:\nWe should _____________.\nWe ought to _____________.\nWe must _____________.\nLet\u2019s _____________.\nThe best course is _____________.\nThe solution is to _____________.\nThe next step should be _____________.\nWe should consider _____________.\nFurther research should be done to determine _____________.\nHere are a few sample claims of policy:\nLandlords should not be allowed to raise the rent more than 2% per year.\nThe federal government should require a background check before allowing anyone to buy a gun.\nSocial media accounts should not be censored in any way.\nA claim of policy can also look like a direct command, such as \u201cSo if you are an American citizen, don\u2019t let anything stop you from\nvoting.\u201d\nNote that not all claims of policy give details or specifics about what should be done or how. Sometimes an author is only trying to\nbuild momentum and point us in a certain direction. For example, \u201cSchools must find a way to make bathrooms more private for\neveryone, not just transgender people.\u201d\nClaims of policy don\u2019t have to be about dramatic actions. Even discussion, research, and writing are kinds of action. For example,\n\u201cAmericans need to learn more about other wealthy nations\u2019 health care systems in order to see how much better things could be in\nAmerica.\u201d\nImage by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nClaims of Fact\nArguments do not always point toward action. Sometimes writers want us to share their vision of reality on a particular subject.\nThey may want to paint a picture of how something happened, describe a trend, or convince us that something is bad or good.\n2.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27173 In some cases, the writer may want to share a particular vision of what something is like, what effects something has, how\nsomething is changing, or of how something unfolded in the past. The argument might define a phenomenon, a trend, or a period of\nhistory.\nOften these claims are simply presented as fact, and an uncritical reader may not see them as arguments at all. However, very often\nclaims of fact are more controversial than they seem. For example, consider the claim, \u201cCaffeine boosts performance.\u201d Does it\nreally? How much? How do we know? Performance at what kind of task? For everyone? Doesn\u2019t it also have downsides? A writer\ncould spend a book convincing us that caffeine really boosts performance and explaining exactly what they mean by those three\nwords.\nSome phrases writers might use to introduce a claim of fact include the following:\nResearch suggests that _____________.\nThe data indicate that _____________.\n_____________is increasing or decreasing.\nThere is a trend toward _____________.\n_____________causes _____________\n_____________leads to _____________.\nOften a claim of fact will be the basis for other claims about what we should do that look more like what we associate with the\nword \u201cargument.\u201d However, many pieces of writing in websites, magazines, office settings, and academic settings don\u2019t try to\nmove people toward action. They aim primarily at getting readers to agree with their view of what is fact. For example, it took\nmany years of argument, research, and public messaging before most people accepted the claim that \u201cSmoking causes cancer.\u201d\nHere are a few arguable sample claims of fact:\nIt is easier to grow up biracial in Hawaii than in any other part of the United States.\nRaising the minimum wage will force many small businesses to lay off workers.\nFires in the western United States have gotten worse primarily because of climate change.\nAntidepressants provide the most benefit when combined with talk therapy.\nClaims of Value\nIn other cases, the writer is not just trying to convince us that something is a certain way or causes something, but is trying to say\nhow good or bad that thing is. They are rating it, trying to get us to share her assessment of its value. Think of a movie or book\nreview or an Amazon or Yelp review. Even a \u201clike\u201d on Facebook or a thumbs up on a text message is a claim of value.\nClaims of value are fairly easy to identify. Some phrases that indicate a claim of value include the following:\n_____________is terrible\/disappointing\/underwhelming.\n_____________is mediocre\/average\/decent\/acceptable.\nWe should celebrate _____________.\n_____________is great, wonderful, fantastic, impressive, makes a substantial contribution to _____________.\nA claim of value can also make a comparison. It might assert that something is better than, worse than, or equal to something else.\nSome phrases that signal a comparative claim of value include these:\n_____________is the best _____________.\n_____________is the worst _____________.\n_____________is better than _____________.\n_____________is worse than _____________.\n_____________is just as good as _____________.\n_____________is just as bad as _____________\nThe following are examples of claims of value:\nThe Bay Area is the best place to start a biotech career.\nForest fires are becoming the worst threat to public health in California.\nHuman rights are more important than border security.\nExperimenting with drag is the best way I\u2019ve found to explore my feelings about masculinity and femininity.\nIt was so rude when that lady asked you what race you are.\n2.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27173 Note that the above arguments all include claims of fact but go beyond observing to praise or criticize what they are observing.\nPractice Exercise 2.2.1\nPractice Exercise 2.2.2\nOn a social media site like Facebook or Twitter or on your favorite news site, find an example of one of each kind of claim.\nThis page titled 2.2: Types of Claims to Look out for is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna\nMills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n2.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27173 2.3: Making Notes on the Writer\u2019s Claims\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (6 min, 35 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 66::3355\nA first step toward summarizing and responding to an argument is to first make margin notes on the claims. Let\u2019s take the\nfollowing argument as an example:\nSample Argument: \"Wouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\"\nAll the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in\nthe rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal\nimmigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?\nI don\u2019t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put\nour security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and\ngood intentions.\nIf I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my\nfamily to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would\nhave a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and\ntell themself, \u201cI want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don\u2019t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong\u201d?\nIf most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing\nso, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall\nor a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with\nempathy, respect, and offers of help.\nWe can often paraphrase the claims more readily on a second read when we are already familiar with the content. Some need the\nphysicality of taking notes by hand in the margins of a book or a printout.\nImage by fotografierende from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nSome take notes by creating comments in Word or Google Docs. Others use online annotation systems like Hypothes.is. Another\nway is to copy the text into a table in a word processing program and write notes in a second column, as we have done below:\n2.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27174 Sample Margin Notes on an Argument's Claims\nSection of the text Notes on the claims\nImplies a claim of fact: we would all cross the border (under what\nWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\ncircumstances?)\nAll the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing\nabout in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of Suggests a claim of value: It might not be wrong to cross illegally.\nlaw, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people But also suggests another claim of value: that \u201cthe rule of law\u201d is right.\nout who are desperate to come in.

Claim of policy: Border walls and detention centers are not right.\nEnds with three policy recommendations for how to treat migrants:\nempathy, respect, and help.\nNotice that attempting to summarize each claim can actually take more space than the original text itself if we are summarizing in\ndetail and trying to be very precise about what the text claims and implies. Of course, we won\u2019t want to or need to do this in such\ndetail for every paragraph of every reading we are assigned to write about. We can resort to it when the argument gets harder to\nfollow or when it\u2019s especially important to be precise.\nPractice Exercise 2.3.1\nMake notes in your own words on the claims of fact, value, and policy you find in an argument you are reading for class or one\nof our suggested readings.

How\ndo we sort them and put them in relation to each other? In this case, we found claims of policy, fact, and value, some of which were\nrepeated in different parts of the argument. Which claim is the main point? How do other claims support this one?\nWhich direction is the author taking the argument?\nPhoto by Brendan Church on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nWe can try asking ourselves the following questions to see if we already have a sense of what the argument's goal is.\nWhat does the writer want us to believe?\nWhat does the writer most want to convince us of?\nWhere is the writer going with this?\nIf the writer had to make their point in just one sentence, what would they say?\nA good first place to look for the focus, of course, is the title. Often the title will declare the main claim outright. Here, the title\nquestion \"Wouldn't We All Cross the Border?\" implies the answer \u201cYes.\u201d We can look for the same idea in the text and check\nwhether it seems to be the main one. The third paragraph describes why the author would cross the border and then generalizes to\nclaim that others would do the same. At the start of the last paragraph, the writer declares that \u201c ...most of us, under desperate\ncircumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so.\u201d Note that this is a claim of\nfact about what people would do and how they would feel about it.\nBut is this the main claim? When we review the other sections, we find several other claims of policy. Introductions set\nexpectations, and here, the first paragraph alludes to public debates on immigration policy. It suggests that it may not be right to\nstop people from coming into America, and it may not be wrong to cross the border, even illegally. These early references to what\nis right suggest that the argument aims to do more than describe how people might feel under different circumstances. The\nargument is going to weigh in on what border policy should be. The second paragraph confirms this sense as it builds up to the still\nvague sentence, \u201c Surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good\nintentions.\u201d\nIn the last paragraph, we learn what these ways might involve. Three different claims of policy emerge:\n1. \u201c... We must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act.\u201d\n2. \"How can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice?\" (The implication, of course, is that they cannot be.)\n3. \u201c We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.\u201d\nWhich of these final claims is the overall focus? Arguments sometimes emphasize their main point in the very last sentence, in part\nto make it memorable. However, the end of the argument can also be a place for the author to go a little beyond their main point\n2.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27175 and suggest issues for further thought. The phrase \"empathy, respect, and offers of help\" sounds important, but we should note that\nthe rest of the argument isn\u2019t about how to help migrants. However, the idea that we should respond more positively to migrants\nhas recurred throughout. The idea that migrants are not in the wrong--that they are not criminals--is clearly key, and so is the idea\nthat we should change border policy accordingly.\nHere is one way, then, to combine those last two ideas into a summary of the overall claim of the argument:\nClaim: Border policy should not criminalize undocumented immigrants.\nPractice Exercise 2.4.1\nChoose an argument you are reading for class or one of our suggested readings, read it closely, and then try to summarize the\nmain claim in your own words. If you are unsure, return to making notes on the writer's claims and then reflect on the\nquestions above.\nThis page titled 2.4: Deciding Which Is the Main Claim is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nAnna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n2.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27175 2.5: Finding the Reasons\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 16 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::1166\nOnce we know what the main point of the reading is, we can ask ourselves what reasons the author gives. We can go through our\nannotations to look at the other claims and see how some may be used as reasons for the main claim or as reasons for one of the\nreasons.\nWe can write the claims in a map and use the arrows to show which claim works as a reason supporting which other claim. Each\nclaim moves our mind from one idea to the next in the direction the writer wants it to go. The claim farthest to the right, the one\nthat the others point toward, is the main point. Such maps might take a few different forms, such as these:\n\u2192\nReason Claim\n\u2192 \u2192\nReason A Reason B Claim\n\u2192\nReason A Claim\nReason B \u2197\nHow can we tell where to put each claim on the map and where to point the arrows? It can help to remember that particular words\nand phrases in academic and professional writing basically act as arrows. They signal that one idea is supposed to lead to another.\nHere are some such phrases:\nBecause_____________, _____________.\nBecause of this, _____________.\nIf_____________, then _____________.\nSince_____________, _____________.\nFor this reason,_____________.\nWe can conclude_____________.\nTherefore, _____________.\nSo_____________.\nConsequently, _____________.\nAs a result, _____________.\nHence_____________.\nThus_____________.\nIt follows that _____________.\nFor example, in the above argument, \u201cIf_____________, then _____________.\u201d connects two claims in the following sentence:\n\u201cIf most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so,\nthen we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act.\u201d\nWe could write a short version of the first half of the sentence, put it in a box, and point it toward a short version of the second half:\n2.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27176 \"Claim and Reason Argument Map\" by Anna Mills is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nSee the accessible text description of this one-reason map.\nThe following sentence sets up another If_____________, then _____________ statement: \u201c If it is ethical and reasonable, then\nhow can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice?\u201d\nWe could add this on thus:\n\"Two Reasons Argument Map\" by Anna Mills is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nSee the accessible text description of this two-reason map.\nIf border walls and detention centers are unjust, there must be a need for an alternate approach.

So as we read we can look for and mark these counterarguments.\nIn a complex text it can be easy to miss that a particular point is actually not one that the writer agrees with--they may be bringing\nit up in order to shoot it down.

Chapter 3 will focus on how to use this understanding to describe the argument in\nour own words. Such a description is called a summary, and it forms part of most college writing assignments. In some cases, the\nsummary will be the entire essay. We may be given a page or word count range, which might be as short as a paragraph or as long\nas several pages. More frequently, the summary will be the starting point; a summary in the introduction or in the first page or two\nwill serve to launch a discussion of our own opinion. In either case, we can use the summary strategies in this chapter to create a\ncoherent chunk of writing that will give the reader a clear picture of the text we are analyzing.\nPhoto by Gerd Altman on Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nIf we have read a text and identified its claims and reasons along with any counterarguments and limits, we are in an excellent\nposition to write a summary. If we have notes on the argument structure or an argument map, those can guide us as we write. Our\nnotes or map will probably help us choose what to leave out and what to emphasize. They will point to the role each claim plays in\nthe overall argument. In the summary, instead of annotations, colors, arrows, and labels like \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201creason,\u201d we will use\nstrategic phrases to show how the parts fit together.\nAs we choose words to paraphrase a writer\u2019s points, we will want to reread the text to see how strongly the writer suggests\nsomething or what attitude they take toward a counterargument. Thus the process of writing a summary helps us get even clearer\nabout the writer\u2019s intentions and implications than we would in making notes or mapping out the argument. Ultimately,\nsummarizing will prepare us to comment, critique and respond more effectively, as we will see in Chapter 4, \"Assessing the\nStrength of an Argument.\"\nThis page titled 3.1: What Is a Summary? is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n3.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/121112 3.2: Introducing the Argument and the Main Claim\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (8 min, 53 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 88::5533\nIntroducing the Argument\nAlmost immediately, the reader of any summary will need some basic information about the argument summarized. We can name\ntitle and author in an introductory phrase. If the publication date and the publication name seem important, we can work those in\ntoo. For example, a summary could introduce the basic data on the sample border argument with the phrase \"In her 2019 article\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d, Anna Mills...\" and follow it with a description of the topic, purpose, or main claim. Some\noptions for introductory phrases include the following:\nIn an article for _____________, writer _____________...\nThe account of _____________ in the piece _____________ by _____________...\nWriting in the journal _____________, the scholar _____________ ...\nNext, probably right after the introductory phrase, the reader will want to know the main point of that argument. To introduce the\nmain claim, we\u2019ll need a well-chosen verb to describe the author\u2019s intention, her purpose in writing. The most general possible verb\nto describe a main claim would be \u201csays,\u201d as in \u201cIn her 2019 article \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d, Anna Mills says\u2026 \u201d\nBut that would tell us so little about what Anna Mills is trying to do. Readers will be bored and will learn nothing from \u201csays.\u201d If\nwe choose a more dramatic and precise verb like \u201ccalls for,\u201d \u201ccriticizes,\u201d \u201cdescribes,\u201d \u201cargues,\u201d or \u201cquestions,\u201d then readers will\nfeel the dynamism and momentum of both the argument and the summary. We can convey a lot about the structure of the argument,\nits degree of conviction or moderation, its tone and attitude by the word or phrase we choose to introduce each claim. As we choose\nthose phrases, we will also be pushing ourselves to get an even clearer picture of the argument than we did by mapping it.\nJust as a person might gesture toward a central feature of a landscape, a summary points readers toward the main claim of a text.\nPhoto by Drew Saurus on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nDescribing Claims of Fact\nIf the argument\u2019s main purpose is to describe reality in some way, we will want to let readers know if it is controversial or not. Is\nthe writer defending their idea against obvious objections or counterarguments, or are they aiming to inform us about something we\nmay not be aware of?\n3.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27184 Phrases to introduce controversial claims of fact\nThey argue that _____________.\nShe maintains that _____________.\nHe contends that _____________.\nThey assert that _____________.\nShe holds that _____________.\nHe insists that _____________.\nShe thinks_____________.\nThey believe that_____________.\nPhrases to introduce widely accepted claims of fact\nHe informs us of _____________.\nShe describes_____________.\nThey note that _____________.\nHe observes that _____________.\nShe explains that _____________.\nThe writer points out the way in which_____________.\nDescribing Claims of Value\nIf the argument\u2019s main purpose is to convince us that something is bad or good or of mixed value, we can signal that evaluation to\nthe reader right off the bat. How dramatic is the claim about its praise or critique? We can ask ourselves how many stars the\nargument is giving the thing it evaluates. A five-star rating \u201ccelebrates\u201d or \u201capplauds\u201d its subject while a four-star rating might be\nsaid to \u201cendorse it with some reservations.\u201d\nPhrases to describe a positive claim of value\nThey praise_____________.\nHe celebrates_____________.\nShe applauds the notion that_____________.\nThey endorse_____________.\nHe admires_____________.\nShe finds value in_____________.\nThey rave about_____________.\nPhrases to describe a negative claim of value\nThe author criticizes_____________.\nShe deplores____________.\nHe finds fault in_____________.\nThey regret that_____________.\nThey complain that_____________.\nThe authors are disappointed in_____________.\nPhrases to describe a mixed claim of value\nThe author gives a mixed review of_____________.\nShe sees strengths and weaknesses in_____________.\nThey endorse_____________ with some reservations.\nHe praises_____________ while finding some fault in _____________\nThe authors have mixed feelings about_____________. On the one hand, they are impressed by_____________, but on the\nother hand, they find much to be desired in_____________.\nDescribing Claims of Policy\nIf, as in the case of our sample argument, the author wants to push for some kind of action, then we can signal to the reader how\nsure the writer seems of the recommendation and how much urgency they feel. Since the border argument uses words like \u201cmust\u201d\n3.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27184 and \u201cjustice\u201d in its final paragraph, we will want to convey that sense of moral conviction if we can, with a verb like \u201curges.\u201d Here\nis one possible first sentence of a summary of that argument:\nIn her 2019 article \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d, Anna Mills urges us to seek a\nnew border policy that helps desperate migrants rather than criminalizing them.\nIf we think there should be even more sense of urgency, we might choose the verb \u201cdemands.\u201d \u201cDemands\u201d would make Mills seem\nmore insistent, possibly pushy. Is she that insistent? We will want to glance back at the original, probably many times, to double-\ncheck that our word choice fits.\nIf the border argument ended with a more restrained tone, as if to convey politeness and humility or even uncertainty, we might\nsummarize it with a sentence like the following:\nIn her 2019 article 'Wouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?', Anna Mills asks us to consider\nhow we can change border policy to help desperate undocumented migrants rather than\ncriminalizing them.\nPhrases to describe a strongly felt claim of policy\nThey advocate for_____________.\nShe recommends_____________.\nThey encourage_____________to _____________.\nThe writers urge_____________.\nThe author is promoting_____________.\nHe calls for_____________.\nShe demands_____________.\nPhrases to describe a more tentative claim of policy\nHe suggests_____________.\nThe researchers explore the possibility of_____________.\nThey hope that_____________can take action to_____________.\nShe shows why we should give more thought to developing a plan to_____________.\nThe writer asks us to consider_____________.\nElaborating on the Main Claim\nDepending on the length of the summary we are writing, we may add in additional sentences to further clarify the argument\u2019s main\nclaim. In the border argument example, the summary we have thus far focuses on the idea of helping migrants, but the argument\nitself has another, related dimension which focuses on the attitudes we should take toward migrants. If we are asked to write only a\nvery short summary, we might leave the explanation of the main claim as it is. If we have a little more leeway, we might add to it to\nreflect this nuance thus:\nIn her 2019 article \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d, Anna Mills urges us to seek a\nnew border policy that helps desperate undocumented migrants rather than criminalizing\nthem. She calls for a shift away from blame toward respect and empathy, questioning the\nvery idea that crossing illegally is wrong.\nOf course, the border argument is short, and we have given an even briefer summary of it. College courses will also ask us to\nsummarize longer, multi-part arguments or even a whole book. In that case, we will need to summarize each sub-section of the\nargument as its own claim.\nPractice Exercise 3.2.1\nFor each claim below, decide whether it is a claim of fact, value, or policy. Write a paraphrase of each claim and introduce it\nwith a phrase that helps us see the writer\u2019s purpose.\n3.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27184 Students should embrace coffee to help them study.\nCoffee is the most powerful, safe substance available to jumpstart the mind.\nCoffee\u2019s effect is universal.\nFor those of us who believe in the life of the mind, enhancing our brains\u2019 abilities is ultimately worth the occasional\ndiscomfort associated with coffee.\nThis page titled 3.2: Introducing the Argument and the Main Claim is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or\ncurated by Anna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n3.2.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27184 3.3: Describing the Reasoning\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (3 min, 38 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 33::3388\nOnce we have introduced the argument we will summarize and described its main claim, we will need to show how it supports this\nclaim.

She calls for a shift toward respect and empathy, questioning the very\nidea that crossing illegally is wrong. She argues that any parent in a desperate position would consider it right to cross for their\nchild\u2019s sake; therefore, no person should condemn that action in another. Since we cannot justify our current walls and\ndetention centers, we must get rid of them.\nPractice Exercise 3.3.1\nFor each pair of claims and reasons below, write a paraphrase of the reason and introduce it with one of the phrases from the\nchapter or another phrase that serves a similar purpose.\nHere's an example.

A\nphrase introducing the author's treatment of the counterargument can signal whether the writer sees some merit in the\ncounterargument or rejects it entirely. In either case, we will almost always want to follow up by describing the author\u2019s response.\nIf the writer sees merit in the objection, we need to explain why they still maintain their position. On the other hand, if the author\ndismisses the counterargument, we need to show how they justify this dismissal.\nIf a writer rejects a counterargument entirely, we can point that out when we summarize. Photo by Anete Lusina on Pexels under\nthe Pexels License.\nPhrases to Introduce a Writer's Handling of a Counterargument\nIf the Author Sees Some Merit in the Counterargument\nThe writer acknowledges that _____________, but still insists that _____________.\nThey concede that _____________; however they consider that _____________.\nHe grants the idea that _____________, yet still maintains that _____________.\nShe admits that _____________, but she points out that_____________.\nThe author sees merit in the idea that _____________, but cannot accept_____________.\nEven though he sympathizes with those who believe _____________, the author emphasizes that _____________.\nIf the Author Rejects the Counterargument Entirely\nShe refutes this claim by arguing that _____________.\nHowever, he questions the very idea that _____________, observing that _____________.\nShe disagrees with the claim that _____________ because _____________.\nThey challenge the idea that _____________ by arguing that _____________.\nHe rejects the argument that_____________, claiming that _____________.\nShe defends her position against those who claim _____________ by explaining that _____________.\nIn the case of the sample border argument, we might summarize the treatment of the counterargument thus:\nMills acknowledges that opening the borders completely would compromise security, but she believes that we can \u201cregulate\u201d\nour borders without blocking or imprisoning migrants.\n3.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27186 Note the choice here to quote the one word \u201cregulate\u201d instead of paraphrasing or using the word without quotation marks. The\nquotation marks draw attention to the author's original word choice and suggest there may be a problem or question about this word\nchoice. In this case, the summary might observe that the writer does not specify what kind of regulation she means.\nPractice Exercise 3.4.1\nBelow are two sample paragraphs in which an author describes a counterargument. For each description, decide whether the\nauthor sees some merit in the counterargument or not (see 2.6).

Some object that ingesting substances to help us study leads to\naddiction. They worry that even a boost to mental functioning will ultimately hurt us because it encourages us to try to fix\nour mind with substances any time we feel out of sorts. This argument, however, is nothing short of paranoid. It would\nresult in some ridiculous conclusions. By its logic, we should not drink water when we\u2019re thirsty because we will become\naddicted.\n2. Many feel that black tea is a better choice than coffee, arguing that it can improve performance just as well with fewer side\neffects. This depends on the individual, though.

The good news is that by introducing each part of the argument to show how it relates to\nthe others, we have already provided many of the transitions we need. We can generate a first draft of the summary by simply\nputting them all together in order.\nImage by Mohamed Hassan on Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nHere is an example of a summary draft that describes the border argument:\nSample Summary\nIn her 2019 article \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d, Anna Mills urges readers to seek a new border policy that helps\ndesperate undocumented migrants rather than criminalizing them. She calls for a shift toward respect and empathy, questioning\nthe very idea that crossing illegally is wrong. Mills argues that any parent in a desperate position would consider it right to\ncross for their child\u2019s sake; therefore, no person should condemn that action in another. Since we cannot justify our current\nwalls and detention centers, we must get rid of them. She acknowledges that opening the borders completely would\ncompromise security, but believes that we can still \u201cregulate\u201d our borders without blocking or imprisoning migrants.\nNext, we can review our border argument map to make sure that we have covered the main parts of the argument.\n3.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27188 \"Argument Map with Limits\" by Anna Mills is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nSee the accessible text description of the argument map with limits.\nIf we are writing a longer summary of an extended argument, our map and our knowledge of the role of each part of the text will\nhelp us organize the essay into paragraphs and transition between them. For example, in a three-page summary of a twenty-five-\npage essay, we might spend a full paragraph on the author\u2019s description of a counterargument and yet another paragraph on the\nauthor\u2019s rebuttal to this counterargument. To open this paragraph, we could refer to our earlier list of templates for describing a\nresponse to a counterargument.\nPractice Exercise 3.6.1\nSummarize the argument below in a few sentences that introduce each element of the argument and its role. If you completed\nthe exercises for the earlier sections in this chapter, you may use some of those answers to those to help you put together this\nparagraph.\nCoffee is a blessing to students. What better way is there to jumpstart the mind and help us engage with our studies? The\nbenefits of coffee are well known, and yet some hold back from it unnecessarily. Some feel that black tea is a better choice,\narguing that it can still boost mental performance with fewer side effects. This depends on the individual. While black tea is\nworth considering, remember that it still comes with side effects, and for many, it simply will not give enough of a boost to the\nbrain. For those of us who believe in the life of the mind, enhancing our brains\u2019 abilities is ultimately of more value than\navoiding the occasional minor discomfort. Of course, a few people who experience severe side effects like anxiety, insomnia,\nor tremors should avoid coffee. For most, though, we can drink coffee in moderation and still feel healthy, as long as we\nexercise and sleep well. Some object to coffee because they believe that ingesting any substance to help us study leads to\naddiction. They worry that even a boost to mental functioning will ultimately hurt us because it encourages us to try to fix our\nmind with substances any time we feel out of sorts. This argument, however, is nothing short of paranoid. It would result in\nsome ridiculous conclusions. By its logic, if we drink water when we\u2019re thirsty, we will end up addicted. If you haven\u2019t given\ncoffee a fair try under the right circumstances, don\u2019t deprive yourself out of fear. Chances are you can do better work and enjoy\nit more with a moderate coffee habit.

Very often in college and\nprofessional life, though, we will need to summarize a multi-page argument in just a sentence, a paragraph, or a page. How do we\ncover the most important ideas of the argument in just a few words? How do we decide what to leave out of the summary?\nWriting a short summary of a long argument could be likened to choosing only the most important groceries to fit into a minature\nshopping cart.\nImage by HOerwin56 from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nIf we have already sorted out which ideas are the supporting examples and statistics and which are the main claim and reasons, that\nknowledge can guide us. The summary can allude to the supporting evidence rather than describing its details. It can leave out the\nspecifics of any anecdotes, testimonials, or statistics.\nFor example, let's imagine we want to summarize an article that encourages people to buy the digital cryptocurrency BitCoin.\nThe article might describe a number of different kinds of products people can buy with BitCoin and tell stories of individuals who\nused BitCoin for different purposes or invested in BitCoin and made a profit. Depending on how long our summary is supposed to\nbe, we can represent those parts of the argument in more or less detail. If we need to summarize the article in a sentence, we might\nsimply refer to all of this supporting evidence with a couple of words like \"variety\" and \"profit.\"\nExample 3.7.1\nSample one-sentence summary: \"Go BitCoin\" by Tracy Kim encourages the general public to buy BitCoin by showing us the\nvariety of things we can buy with it and the profit to be made.\"\nIf we have a bit more space, we might keep the same single-sentence overview but also throw in a few examples of the kinds of\nspecifics mentioned in the article.\n3.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/121106 Example 3.7.2\nSample slightly longer summary: \"Go BitCoin\" by Tracy Kim encourages the general public to buy BitCoin by showing us\nthe variety of things we can buy with it and the profit to be made. First, Kim describes how we would go about paying for a\nrange of products, from a Tesla to a sofa. Second, she gives statistics on BitCoin's rate of return and tells the stories of three\nyoung people who invested modest amounts in BitCoin and saw their money as much as triple within a year.\nNotice how, in the above example, the summary alludes to three stories that have something in common but gives a detail that only\napplies to one of them. The summary writer chose the most memorable example of profit to include. If we have space to write a\nfull paragraph, we could include more detail on the process of buying with bitcoin, on the investment statistics alluded to, and on\nthe stories of investors.\nExample 3.7.3\nSample paragraph-long summary: \"Go BitCoin\" by Tracy Kim encourages the general public to buy the cryptocurrency\nBitCoin by showing us the variety of things we can buy with it and the profit to be made. First, Kim describes how we would\ngo about paying for a range of products, from a Tesla to a sofa. She shows how more and more vendors are accepting BitCoin\ndirectly, but for the moment some of the largest ones, like Amazon, require buyers to use a third-party app to convert their\nBitCoin. Second, she gives statistics on BitCoin's rate of return. BitCoin has gone through boom and bust cycles, but most\nrecently its value increased 252% between July 2020 and July 2021. Finally, she tells the stories of three young people who\ninvested modest amounts in BitCoin and saw their money as much as triple within a year. Kim shows how ordinary people can\nsee more options open up in their lives through these investments. One teenager, Vijay Mather, was able to cover four years of\ncollege tuition by investing his earnings from working at Trader Joe's.\nThe original argument would include many more details, including how Vijay Mather got interested in BitCoin and exactly how\nmuch he made on his investment. It probably also includes the names of the other two young people it profiles and more about their\nexperiences. However, the summary writer has picked out what those experiences have in common--the fact that the profits\nallowed them to consider new options in their lives. The writer has focused on Tracy Kim's purpose in presenting those\nexamples: to raise readers' awareness of the possibilities.\nExercise 3.7.1\nRead the two paragraphs below.\n1. Summarize them in just one sentence.\n2. Summarize them in two to three sentences, including a few more specifics.\nThe Black\/white binary is the predominant racial binary system at play in the American context. We can see that this\nBlack\/white binary exists and is socially constructed if we consider the case of the 19th Century Irish immigrant. When they\nfirst arrived, Irish immigrants were \u201cblackened\u201d in the popular press and the white, Anglo-Saxon imagination (Roediger 1991).\nCartoon depictions of Irish immigrants gave them dark skin and exaggerated facial features like big lips and pronounced\nbrows. They were depicted and thought to be lazy, ignorant, and alcoholic nonwhite \u201cothers\u201d for decades.\nOver time, Irish immigrants and their children and grandchildren assimilated into the category of \u201cwhite\u201d by strategically\ndistancing themselves from Black Americans and other non-whites in labor disputes and participating in white supremacist\nracial practices and ideologies. In this way, the Irish in America became white. A similar process took place for Italian-\nAmericans, and, later, Jewish American immigrants from multiple European countries after the Second World War. Similar to\nIrish Americans, both groups became white after first being seen as non-white. These cases show how socially constructed race\nis and how this labeling process still operates today. For instance, are Asian-Americans, considered the \u201cmodel minority,\u201d the\nnext group to be integrated into the white category, or will they continue to be regarded as foreign threats? Only time will tell.\nFrom Introduction to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies by Miliann Kang, Donovan Lessard, Laura Heston, and Sonny\nNordmarken, UMass Amherst Libraries, licensed under CC BY 4.0.\nThis page titled 3.7: Writing a Short Summary of a Long Argument is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or\ncurated by Anna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n3.7.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/121106 3.8: Sample Summaries\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (59 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 00::5599\n1.

(Note: The opening statement provides the\nessay's overall context: the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.) However, its effects will be long-lasting. While the pandemic has\naffected everyone\u2019s lives in every aspect, its impacts on women are even more severe. (Note: The followup statement introduces\nthe essay's particular focus: the impact of the pandemic on women.) Helen Lewis, the author of the Atlantic Magazine article \u201cThe\nCoronavirus Is a Disaster for Feminism,\u201d explains why the pandemic threatens feminism. (Note: Early on, the summary names the\nauthor, title, and magazine that published the argument summarized.) Lewis starts her article with a complaint by saying \u201cenough\nalready\u201d because, in terms of housework especially for child care, there has been an inequality since the past. This inequality has\nbecome even more explicit with the coronavirus outbreak. Women have to shoulder not only more housework but also childcare\nmore than ever due to school closures. The pandemic started as a public health crisis and brought along an economic one. Lewis\nargues that the crisis affects women more than men because women are more likely to assume housework and childcare\nresponsibilities while men are expected to work and \u201cbring home the bacon.\u201d (Note: The author provides a thesis at the end of the\nintroduction with a clear overview of the main claim of the argument summarized.)\nLewis supports her claim by pointing out that during the pandemic, the gender pay gap pushes women to take on caregiving while\nmen continue to work outside the home. (Note: The phrase \"supports her claim\" shows us that this paragraph will describe one of\nLewis' reasons.) She writes, \u201call this looking after\u2014this unpaid caring labor\u2014will fall more heavily on women\" because\nhouseholds depend more on men's pay. To support this idea, she includes provocative questions from Clare Wenham, an assistant\nprofessor of global health policy at the London School of Economics: \u201cWho is paid less? Who has the flexibility?\u201d (Note: The\nauthor supports the summary with short quotes from the argument where the wording is important.) The questions express\nWenham's frustration. Lewis implies that this existing structure is based upon the gender pay gap, the reality that women make less\nmoney. She believes that couples do not have many options: it is a kind of survival rule that whoever earns less should stay at\nhome.\nLewis blames the influence of old-fashioned ideas about gender roles for compounding the effects of the pay gap during the\npandemic. Dual-earner parents must find a way to meet children\u2019s needs during the shelter-in-place. Lewis observes that women\noften are the ones who take on the role of stay-at-home parent. (Note: This paragraph shows how another reason, gender role\nexpectations, combines with the economic reason to support the main claim.) She humorously notes, \u201cDual-income couples might\nsuddenly be living like their grandparents, one homemaker, and one breadwinner.\u201d Lewis sees this as a kind of embarrassing\nregression. The gender dynamic has slid back two generations, showing that cultural beliefs about the role of the mother haven't\nchanged as much as we might think. (Note: The use of the word \"embarrassing\" suggests that Lewis is not just observing but\nmaking a claim of value. The summary reflects Lewis' attitude as well as her ideas.) Lewis acknowledges that some families do try\nto split childcare equally, but she emphasizes that these are in the minority.\nLewis sees implications for her claim beyond the current pandemic. (Note: The end of the summary notes how Lewis extends her\nargument by claiming that other pandemics will have similar gendered effects.) She draws a parallel to the effect on women of the\nEbola health crisis which occurred in West Africa in the time period of 2014-2016. According to Lewis, during this outbreak, many\n3.8.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/97923 African girls lost their chance at an education; moreover, many women died during childbirth because of a lack of medical care.\n(Note: Lewis supports this with a historical example of another pandemic that disproportionately hurt women.) Mentioning this\nproves that not only coronavirus but also other outbreaks can be a disaster for feminism. Pandemics, in other words, pile yet\nanother problem on women who always face an uphill battle against patriarchal structures. (Note: The concluding sentence\nreinforces the extended version of Lewis' main point in a memorable, dramatic way.)\nAttribution\nThis sample essay was written by Gizem Gur and edited by Anna Mills.

For a more traditional visual format, see the PDF version of \"Typography and Identity.\"\nEssay Z\nEnglish 1C\nProf. Saramanda Swigart\nTypography and Identity\nJohn Eligon's New York Times article, \u201cA Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans \u2018Black\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019?\u201d\noutlines the ongoing conversation among journalists and academics regarding conventions for writing about race\u2014specifically,\nwhether or not to capitalize the \u201cb\u201d in \u201cblack\u201d when referring to African-Americans (itself a term that is going out of style). (Note:\nThe opening sentence introduces the text this essay will respond to and gives a brief summary of the text's content.) Eligon argues\nthat, while it might seem like a minor typographical issue, this small difference speaks to the question of how we think about\nrace in the United States. Are words like \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d mere adjectives, descriptors of skin color? Or are they proper nouns,\nindicative of group or ethnic identity? Eligon observes that until recently, with the prominence of the Black Lives Matter\nmovement, many journalistic and scholarly publications tended to use a lowercase \u201cblack,\u201d while Black media outlets typically\ncapitalized \u201cBlack.\u201d He suggests that the balance is now tipping in favor of \"Black,\" but given past changes, usage will probably\nchange again as the rich discussion about naming, identity, and power continues. (Note: The thesis statement includes two related\nideas explored by Eligon: the current trend toward using \"Black\" and the value of the ongoing discussion that leads to changing\nterms.)\nEligon points to a range of evidence that \"Black\" is becoming the norm, including a recent change by \"hundreds of news\norganizations\" including the Associated Press. This comes in the wake of the George Floyd killing, but it also follows a longtime\nBlack press tradition exemplified by newspapers like The New York Amsterdam News. Eligon cites several prominent academics\nwho are also starting to capitalize Black. However, he also quotes prominent naysayers and describes a variety of\ncounterarguments, like the idea that capitalization gives too much dignity to a category that was made up to oppress people. (Note:\nSummary of a counterargument.) Capitalizing Black raises another tricky question: Shouldn't White be likewise capitalized?\nEligon points out that the groups most enthusiastic to capitalize White seem to be white supremacists, and news organizations want\nto avoid this association. (Note: The choice of \"points out\" signals that everyone would agree that mostly white supremacist\ngroups capitalize White.)\nEligon's brief history of the debate over racial labels, from \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored\u201d to \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and \u201cperson of color,\u201d\ngives the question of to-capitalize-or-not-to-capitalize a broader context, investing what might seem like a minor quibble for editors\nwith the greater weight of racial identity and its evolution over time. (Note: This paragraph shifts focus from present to past trends\nand debates.) He outlines similar disagreements over word-choice and racial labels by scholars and activists like Fannie Barrier\nWilliams and W.E.B. Du Bois surrounding now-antiquated terms like \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored.\u201d These leaders debated whether labels\nwith negative connotations should be replaced, or embraced and given a new, positive connotation. (Note: This paragraph\nsummarizes the historical examples Eligon gives. Phrases like \"He cites\" point out that certain ideas are being used to support a\nclaim.) Eligon observes that today's \"black\" was once used as a pejorative but was promoted by the Black Power movement\nstarting in the late sixties, much as the word \"Negro\" was reclaimed as a positive word. (Note: Summary of a historical trend that\nparallels today's trend.) However, the Reverend Jesse Jackson also had some success in calling for a more neutral term, \"African\nAmerican,\" in the late eighties. He thought it more appropriate to emphasize a shared ethnic heritage over color. (Note: Summary\nof a historical countertrend based on a counterargument to the idea of reclaiming negative terms.) Eligon suggests that this\n3.8.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/97924 argument continues to appeal to some today, but that such terms have been found to be inadequate given the diversity of ethnic\nheritage. \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and the more generalized \u201cpeople\/person of color\u201d do not give accurate or specific enough\ninformation. (Note: Describes a response to the counterargument, a justification of today's trend toward Black.)\nUltimately, Eligon points to personal intuition as an aid to individuals in the Black community grappling with these questions. He\ndescribes the experience of sociologist Crystal M. Fleming, whose use of lowercase \u201cblack\u201d transformed to capitalized \u201cBlack\u201d\nover the course of her career and years of research. Her transition from black to Black is, she says, as much a matter of personal\nchoice as a reasoned conclusion\u2014suggesting that it will be up to Black journalists and academics to determine the conventions of\nthe future. (Note: This last sentence of this summary paragraph focuses on Eligon's conclusion, his implied argument about what\nshould guide the choice of terms.\nWorks Cited\n(Note: The Works Cited page uses MLA documentation style appropriate for an English class.)\nEligon, John. \u201cA Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans \u2018Black\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019?\u201d The New York Times, 26 Jun\n2020. https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/26\/us\/black-african-american-style- debate.html?\naction=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage\nAttribution\nThis sample essay was written and annotated by Saramanda Swigart and edited by Anna Mills.

In this case we need to provide summaries of\ntwo (or more) related but distinct arguments; let\u2019s call them A and B here. We might find common ground between two unlike\nauthors, tease out the subtle differences between two seemingly similar authors, or point out the opposing assumptions underlying\ncompeting claims. Ultimately, we'll be asked to go beyond summarizing the two to explore the implications of their similarity\nand\/or difference. What can the comparison teach us? What insight do we gain by juxtaposing A and B?\nComparing Jupiter to Earth might give perspective on Earth's size and atmosphere.\nImage by WikiImages from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nEstablishing a topic in common\nTo frame the compare-and-contrast essay, it helps to describe a common context, something happening in the world, that both texts\nrespond to. What unites these arguments: A theme, a current or historical event, a theoretical lens? Let's say we want to compare\nand contrast the essay we have already discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, Anna Mills\u2019 \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d with a\nnew argument about borders, \u201cThe Weight of the World\u201d by Saramanda Swigart:\n\"The Weight of the World\" by Saramanda Swigart\nWhile illegal immigrants crossing the border to the United States may come from desperate circumstances, it is unjust,\nimpractical, and unrealistic for one nation to solve the problems of so many non-citizens.\nIllegal immigration challenges the rule of law. If laws can be broken simply because lawbreakers had good intentions, this\nsuggests that obeying the law is merely optional\u2014that the law is something to be obeyed only when it is convenient to do so. It\nis understandable that plenty of people who break the law do so with good intentions, but enforcement of the law cannot be\nreduced to investigations of intentions\u2014it must ultimately spring from concrete actions.\nThe truth is that illegal immigration presents a security risk. Because illegal immigrants are not tracked by any immigration\nagency and thus remain largely anonymous, it is impossible to verify which immigrants come in search of a new life and plan\nto abide by the laws of their host country and which do not. A porous border may allow for waves of well-meaning immigrants\nand their families to seek new lives in a new country, but no country should be blamed for wanting to secure its borders or its\nterritory.\nAn influx of immigration also strains a nation's resources. Understandably, in many cases, immigrants seeking shelter in the\nUnited States have left desperate circumstances and arrive seeking support. In a perfect world, this would not be a problem;\nhowever, because a nation's resources are finite, this means that the financial and material burden of taking care of incoming\n3.9.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/81417 immigrants falls on their host county. In small, manageable numbers this isn\u2019t a problem (this is what legal immigration is for)\nbut one can see how a nation tasked with taking care of immigrants from around the world would be burdened beyond its\nresources if it must solve the whole world's humanitarian problems.\nUltimately, we shouldn\u2019t increase our tolerance of illegal border crossings. In order to address the plight of immigrants,\nmaintain national security, and manage internal resources, all policy changes should involve balancing the needs of non-\ncitizens with the needs of citizens before carefully and thoughtfully expanding legal immigration.\nIn a paper comparing Mills\u2019 and Swigart\u2019s theses, we need to frame the problem central to both arguments; the implications of\nillegal immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a controversial issue of some urgency today. Consider the following sentences,\nwhich place both articles in the cultural context within which they are written:\n\u201cIn recent years illegal immigration into the United States at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a divisive political topic, resulting\nin a widening partisan divide as to whose priorities we should privilege: the immigrants\u2019 or the nation\u2019s. Are we global citizens or\nAmerican citizens first?\u201d\nIdentifying areas of agreement and disagreement\nNow, what points do the two articles make? Are there any overlapping claims? Are these two authors in complete disagreement or\ndo you see areas in which they share values and\/or concede points to one another? We can start by brainstorming the ways A is\nsimilar to B and the ways they differ. As you\u2019ll recall, Mills\u2019 essay appeals to empathy, suggesting that we would become border-\ncrossers ourselves in the right circumstances. She argues for a reevaluation of immigration policies and practices with an increased\nemphasis on compassion for immigrant families. Swigart\u2019s essay, on the other hand, asks us to make pragmatic assessments about\nnational security and resource allocation, placing national interests before concern for immigrants\u2019 wellbeing. Swigart emphasizes\nthe necessity for a nation to secure its borders and enforce its laws.\nPhoto by George Milton on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nHow to organize a compare-and-contrast essay\nIn the introduction, we will want to identify what topic the two arguments have in common and offer a thesis statement that\nexplains the relationship between A and B. The strategies below may help. In the next section, we will look at a complete sample\nessay that compares Mills\u2019 and Swigart\u2019s arguments.\nForming the thesis\nIn the case of compare-and-contrast essays, the thesis can summarize the essential differences or surprising similarities between the\ntexts.\nExample 3.9.1\nThesis: Though Mills and Swigart agree on the urgency as well as the root causes of our border crisis, they disagree on\nwhether the solution should prioritize American citizens' or refugees' needs.\n3.9.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/81417 Text-by-text organization\nThen we\u2019ll need to select a way to organize the compare and contrast essay. Here are two basic ways to organize the body of a\ncompare and contrast essay: text by text and point by point. If we think that B extends A, or if A is a lens through which to see B,\nwe might decide to use a text-by-text scheme. That means we'll summarize the claims, reasons, and warrants of A followed by the\nclaims, reasons, warrants of B. For instance, if Mills\u2019 essay were outlining the need for immigration reform, and essay B were\noutlining policy to create such immigration reform, we could quickly summarize Mills\u2019 ideas in a body paragraph before moving\non to B\u2019s proposals in their own body paragraph.\nPoint-by-point organization\nIf A and B approach a series of similar issues from different standpoints, a point-by-point scheme can highlight their different\napproaches. That means we\u2019ll break the argument into the different topics that both essays address. In the immigration example, we\nmight include a paragraph about the two \u201csides\u201d of the debate; a paragraph devoted to whether it is ethical to break the law in\ndesperate circumstances; a paragraph devoted to issues of national security; and a paragraph that compares the proposed solutions.\nTopic sentences\nIn all essays, each new point needs to refer back to some part of the thesis. Each topic sentence should refer to one of the points of\ncomparison that was already mentioned in the thesis. The sample phrases below may be useful as we emphasize particular\nsimilarities or differences.\nPhrases for compare and contrast essays\nCommon phrases that indicate similarity and difference can help to clarify how each point about A relates to another point about B.\nSee Section 12.3: Showing How a New Idea Fits in for more on this.\nPhrases that highlight a similarity\nJust as A does, B believes that______________.\nBoth A and B see ______________ as an important issue.\nWe have seen how A maintains that ______________. Similarly, B ______________.\nA argues that______________. Likewise, B ______________.\nA and B agree on the idea that ______________.\nPhrases that highlight a difference\nA focuses on______________; however B is more interested in______________.\nA\u2019s claim is that______________. Conversely, B maintains that ______________.\nWhereas A argues that______________, B______________.\nWhile A emphasizes______________, B______________.\nUnlike A, B believes that______________.\nRather than ______________ like A, B______________,\nWhereas A argues that ______________, B maintains ______________.\nJuxtaposing a similarity with a difference\nWe can also describe a similarity and a difference in close proximity. Here are some sample sentences that do that:\nBoth A and B assert that ______________, but they differ in their approach to ______________.\nWhile A condemns the weaknesses of ______________, B praises its strengths.\nA outlines the problem of ______________ in the abstract while B proposes solutions to the problem.\nThough A and B agree on the root cause of ______________, they differ on its solution.\n3.9.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/81417 This page titled 3.9: Comparing and Contrasting Arguments is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated\nby Saramanda Swigart.\n3.9.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/81417 3.10: A Sample Compare-and-Contrast Essay\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (34 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 00::3344\nThe essay \"Contested Territory\" compares and contrasts two arguments on immigration: \"Wouldn't We All Cross the Border\" by\nAnna Mills and \"The Weight of the World\" by Saramanda Swigart.

(Note: The author\nestablishes a frame of reference in the first sentence, referencing the cultural context surrounding illegal immigration.) Are we\nglobal citizens or American citizens first? Anna Mills\u2019 \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border?\u201d and Saramanda Swigart's \u201cThe\nWeight of the World\u201d offer opposing views on this controversial issue. (Note: Here are our grounds for comparison, wherein the\nauthor briefly summarizes the two stances on immigration.)While Mills considers us global citizens, arguing for compassion\ntoward suffering in our reevaluation of immigration policies and practices, Swigart believes we must be American citizens first,\npointing out the necessity for a nation to secure its borders and enforce its laws. (Note: Essay thesis)\nAs an advocate of compassion, Mills questions the ethics of enforcing immigration laws and argues for empathy with illegal\nimmigrants because, given the same circumstances, many or most of us would make the same choice to cross a border illegally if it\nmeant a chance for a better life for ourselves or our families. (Note: Topic sentence resupplies language from the thesis and signals\nwhat will be discussed first.) The author puts herself, and by extension the reader, in an illegal immigrant's position: \u201cIf I were\nraising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S.,\nI would take it\u201d (Mills). (Note: Essay supports the summary with quotations selected from the text.) This argument for empathy\nrelies on pathos, appealing to readers\u2019 own emotional desires for their families\u2019 well-being. However, Mills' argument links pathos\nto pragmatism as Mills draws the logical conclusion that, if, given the same circumstances, \u201cmany or most of us would make the\nsame choice, we cannot condemn those who choose to immigrate illegally\u201d (Mills). Her argument evokes the Golden Rule; to turn\nour backs on obvious suffering is to turn our backs on ourselves, and is thus immoral by definition.\nWhile the essay argues for empathy, it limits the scope of its argument from offering a comprehensive vision of what a new or\nimproved immigration policy would consist of, as Mills acknowledges \u201cI don\u2019t have a clear vision yet of what the right border\npolicy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk.\u201d (Note: Discussion of the acknowledged\nlimits on Mills' argument sets the stage for Swigart's counterargument.)She anticipates the potential counterargument and shares\nher own concerns for the law and national security, and concludes that any immigration policy must be based on humanitarian\nvalues and priorities: \u201cWe must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated\u2014with empathy, respect, and offers\nof help\u201d (Mills). Thus she is not advocating open borders without regulation. Rather, she asks that policy take the plight of the\nimmigrants into account, calling on us to treat everyone as though they are citizens of the world, having inherently the same rights\nto dignity and safety as U.S. citizens do. (Note: This essay is organized text-by-text, though it could easily have been organized\npoint-by-point.)\nIn contrast, Swigart emphasizes not compassion, but the rule of law and the primacy of national security. (Note: \"In contrast\" is a\ntransitional phrase that signals a divergent point of view.)Instead of invoking pathos by emphasizing the personal, Swigart\nemphasizes impersonal and abstract concerns like respect for the law, the priority of secure borders, and the need to consider finite\nresources. The first point, concerning the rule of law, argues that \u201cIf laws can be broken simply because lawbreakers had good\nintentions, this suggests that obeying the law is merely optional\u201d (Swigart) and concludes that routine circumvention of law without\n3.10.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/97922 penalty would undermine rule of law more broadly. The second point is similar but applied to concerns for national security.\nAlthough the author acknowledges the sympathetic situation of immigrant families, she argues that \u201cno country should be blamed\nfor wanting to secure its borders or its territory\u201d (Swigart). These first two arguments are presented as self-evident arguments or\ntruisms\u2014essentially, violation of the law undermines the law, and a porous border undermines national security.\nSwigart's third argument is perhaps more complicated, as she argues that one nation should not be obligated to shoulder the burden\nof solving other nations' humanitarian or economic crises. (Note: The writer examines one of Swigart's points in more detail, just as\nthey examined Mills' points.)\u201cBecause a nation's resources are finite,\u201d Swigart argues, \u201cthe financial and material burden of taking\ncare of incoming immigrants falls on their host county.\u201d She goes on to cast doubt upon the notion that a single nation can and\nshould solve the whole world's humanitarian problems. Here Swigart highlights the extreme implications of the argument she\ndisagrees with in order to convince readers of its absurdity.\nWhile both authors make compelling points, there are many assumptions they both make that are left unexamined. For instance,\nMills\u2019 essay assumes that there are no alternatives to allowing immigrants with good intentions into the country. For instance, the\nUnited States could invest or intervene in countries whose populations are suffering, improving their material conditions and\nthereby eliminating the need to immigrate. Likewise, Swigart fails to acknowledge that the United States is in fact the cause of\nsome of the world\u2019s problems and thus has a responsibility toward the lives it has disrupted; or that studies show the admittance of\nimmigrants, rather than over-taxing the nation\u2019s resources actually improves the nation\u2019s economy. Both points of view might\nbenefit from a deeper examination of their assumptions. (Note: Here the writer moves beyond summarizing and comparing the\narguments to assessing their validity. This analysis might be the basis of a response essay.)\nMore importantly, the two approaches to immigration might not be in such dramatic conflict as the authors would have us believe.\nA policy that expands legal immigration to families in desperate need, for instance, while still cracking down on illegal\nimmigration could potentially satisfy both sides of the argument. This is the problem with many partisan issues today. While we\nspill ink proving the other wrong, we miss opportunities to find common ground on which to build. (Note: In the conclusion, the\ncomparison between the two essays leads to a proposal for a way to satisfy the demands of both.)\nAttribution\nSample essay and annotations by Saramanda Swigart, edited by Anna Mills, offered under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC\nlicense.\nThis page titled 3.10.1: Annotated Compare-and-Contrast Essay is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or\ncurated by Saramanda Swigart.\n3.10.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/97922 3.11: Common Summary Phrases\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (7 min, 24 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 77::2244\nHere are all of the common phrases discussed in Chapter 3 for summarizing different elements of an argument and comparing two\narguments.

When\nreading through an argument, we naturally ask ourselves whether we agree or disagree as we go. We may be writing exclamation\nmarks or expressions of outrage in the margins, or we may be feeling uneasy because we are not sure yet what we think. Either\nway, we are probably impatient to find our own voice. When do we get to weigh in? Once our readers understand the original text\nand trust that we understand it, they are in our hands, ready to listen to our assessment. Our critique will be clearer since we have\nspent time thinking about the foundations of the argument and the author\u2019s purpose and meaning. The work we have done puts us\nin the best position to add something of our own to the conversation.\nImage by Arek Socha from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nMost college essay assignments do ask us to critically evaluate arguments, not just summarize them. To give a taste of what these\nkinds of assignments look like and how common they are, let\u2019s turn to courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a\nhighly regarded university specializing in engineering, science, mathematics, and technology. We might not expect MIT to\nemphasize writing skills, but the assignments in its publicly available \u201cOpen Courseware\u201d frequently ask students to critically\nevaluate arguments. Here are four examples:\n1. A prompt from the MIT course \u201cAmerican History Since 1865,\u201d taught by professor Caley Horan, reads as follows:\nThe historian Eric Foner argues that Reconstruction should be understood as an \"unfinished revolution.\" In what ways, if\nany, were the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period that followed revolutionary, and for whom? What was left\n\"unfinished\" by Reconstruction? Essays should present an original argument that responds to the above prompt. This\nargument should be unique (of your own making) and should reflect careful and serious engagement with course materials.\n2. In the economics course \u201cThe Challenge of World Poverty\u201d at MIT, students are asked to write an essay on the following topic:\nDespite being quite poor, China currently has a savings rate that is much higher than most other countries in the world. An\narticle by Shang-Jin Wei in VoxEU proposes one interesting reason why Chinese households tend to save so much. Do you\nfind the article's evidence plausible? What other factors may explain why initially poor East Asian countries have saved at\nvery high rates over the past sixty years?\n3. A third prompt comes from the MIT course \u201cGlobalization: the Good, the Bad, and the In-Between\u201d:\nIn his introduction to The Ornament of the World, Harold Bloom says: \u201c...Our current multiculturalism, the blight of our\nuniversities and of our media, is a parody of the culture of Cordoba and Granada in their lost prime.\" What does Bloom\nmean? Is multiculturalism today different from the tolerance exhibited by the societies of Al-Andalus? Do you agree with\nhim? Argue either for or against Bloom's position.\n4. Finally, an experimental biology class demands the following:\n4.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27190 Write a brief critique (2-3 pp.) of Arbuckle, Melissa R., et al. \"Development of Autoantibodies before the Clinical Onset of\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\" from The New England Journal of Medicine, focusing on the illustrations.\nAll four of these essay prompts direct the student to focus deeply on one argument and explain it. Then the student must express an\noriginal critical response. This is in some ways similar to a movie review: a reviewer has to give some picture of what the movie is\nlike before praising or panning it. We might not think of history, economics, and biology courses as all calling on one skill, but the\nstudent who has practice summarizing arguments and critiquing them can likely do well on all of the above assignments.\nSo how do we get started? In this chapter, we will discuss how to return to the structure of the argument map to search for any\nfaults. We will look at problems with the clarity of the claims, the solidity of the reasons, and the validity of the assumptions. In the\nnext chapter, we will talk about the options for making recommendations in response to any problems we find.\nThis page titled 4.1: Use a Summary to Launch an Opinion is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nAnna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n4.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27190 4.2: Check If the Meaning Is Clear\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (10 min, 58 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1100::5588\nOverview\nSometimes we can identify the point a writer is trying to make, but major questions still remain about what the writer means. A\ncritique can point out the ambiguity--the many possible meanings of some part of the argument. Often arguments are ambiguous\nbecause they use words or phrases that have multiple definitions. For example, \u201cWe should all support reproductive justice.\u201d There\nisn\u2019t one widely accepted definition of reproductive justice. Even if readers are aware that the phrase refers to options different\ngroups of women have around pregnancy, they may be wondering if it means access to abortion across racial and economic groups\nor access to birth control or sex education or some combination of all of those. Are supporters of reproductive justice always pro-\nchoice? What is it exactly that the argument is asking us to support?\nPhoto by Jon Tyson on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nLet\u2019s look at the elements of the border argument we have studied and ask ourselves if any of the statements need to be clarified.\nBelow, question marks indicate statements that are in some way ambiguous.\n4.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27192 In our assessment, we can describe any areas of ambiguity by adding questions to our summary of the argument. Let\u2019s look at some\nsample writing about the ambiguities marked with question marks in the map above.\nWhen the author limits her claim to migrants in \u201cdesperate circumstances,\u201d what does she mean? She describes this in different\nwords in different places, calling the migrants people \u201cwho are driven by need and good intentions\u201d and giving the example of a\nparent \u201craising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence.\u201d But we might find it important to ask\nwhere she draws the line between desperation and discontent. Does she want to check first to see how desperate migrants are?\nWould she consider it appropriate to put an immigrant in a detention center for trying to cross illegally if they were wealthy and\nsafe in their country of origin?\nWhat does she mean by \u201chelp\u201d? The word makes us think of humanitarian relief: handouts of food, shelter, and medical care.\nHow much material assistance is she talking about and how much money does she think the United States should spend on this?\nDoesn\u2019t the current system provide some material assistance, in part through the detention centers? More fundamentally, does\n\u201chelp\u201d mean that she wants us to let migrants in? Would she still consider it \"help\" to assist them to settle in another country or\nto improve their life in their country of origin? How would either of those versions of \"help\" work? We might imply that she\nshould specify her meaning. Or we might suggest that she left the concept of \"help\" ambiguous because there is no good answer\nto these questions: there is no satisfactory way to offer people a better life where they came from, and we cannot endlessly\nsupport them at the border.\nWhat does she mean by \u201cregulate\u201d? The word sounds reassuring, but it implies some control and yet she is talking about not\nkeeping people out. If you can\u2019t turn people away, what kind of control or safety guarantee can you have? Does she just mean\ninspecting them for arms and drugs? Or does she mean some kind of extensive background check? But in that case, wouldn\u2019t\nwe need detention centers while we waited for the result?\nPhrases for pointing out what is not clear\nWe do not need any special vocabulary to point out ambiguity, but sometimes seeing typical phrases can help jumpstart our\nthinking. Here are some approaches:\n4.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27192 Ask a question\nWhat exactly does she mean by _____________?\nDescribe the author\u2019s actions and shortcomings\nHe seems to imply that _____________, but leaves ambiguous whether or not that means_____________.\nThey fail to clarify what exactly _____________ refers to.\nHe does not define what he means by _____________.\nShe explores _____________, but fails to articulate a clear message.\nRefer to the argument\u2019s failure to clarify\nThis leaves open the question of _____________.\nThe argument never specifies whether _____________ or _____________.\nRefer to readers\u2019 probable confusion\nReaders will wonder if they mean_____________ or _____________.\nReaders may be confused by the shifting meaning of the term \u201c_____________.\u201d\nMany will interpret _____________ to mean _____________, but some might also take it to mean _____________.\nHow much of a problem is the lack of clarity?\nSince our goal in an assessment is to decide how effective we think the argument will be at getting its point across, any charge of\nvagueness implies some failure to communicate that point. This becomes a critique. But is it a minor flaw in the argument, or does\nit mean that the whole argument has no validity? The seriousness of the critique depends on how central the lack of clarity is to\nwhat the writer is trying to claim in the argument and whether there is an obvious way to clarify the argument or not.\nSometimes we can make an educated guess as to what the author meant based on clues we find in the rest of the argument. We can\ndescribe what the most likely meaning is but still note why readers might reasonably have another interpretation. Sometimes it isn\u2019t\npossible to figure out what the author means. In our assessment, we just have to put our finger on what isn\u2019t clear.\nThe lack of clarity may not be a serious flaw if we can make a reasonable guess as to what the author intends based on the rest of\nthe argument. We can simply point out such a case:\nThe writer does not specify whether _____________ or _____________, but we can infer that _____________ because\n_____________.\nIt also may not be too serious if it is a side point rather than a central point that needs to be clarified. In that case, we might want to\nthink about how one clarification or another might affect our assessment. We can specify in our assessment that we support the\nargument if it means what we think it means but not if it means something else.\nHowever, sometimes the vagueness covers a fatal flaw in the argument, a difficulty, contradiction, or gap that cannot be explained\naway. One particular kind of ambiguity that undermines the argument is when the writer uses a word in two different ways while\nacting as if it only has one meaning. A change in a word\u2019s meaning, whether intentional or not, can lead to an unjustified\nconclusion. This is called equivocation.\nFor example, consider the following paraphrase of an example found on fallacyfiles.org:\n\"No medical professional should be allowed to intentionally harm a human. What is a fetus if not human? How, then, can anyone\ndispute that abortion is wrong and should be illegal?\"\nThere may or may not be legitimate reasons to oppose legal abortion. However, the above argument does not hold up because it\ndepends on a sleight of hand, a shift from the idea of a human, meaning a human being, to the adjective \"human,\" which can apply\nto anything with human cells and DNA, including hair and toenails. We can tell that the above argument is faulty if we substitute\n\"fetus\" for \"hair\" to construct a similar argument:\n\"No medical professional should be allowed to intentionally harm a human. Surely our hair and fingernails are human, not animal.\nTherefore cutting hair and nails should be illegal.\"\n4.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27192 The question any argument about abortion needs to resolve, of course, is whether a fetus can be considered a human being, not\nwhether a fetus has human cells. So this ambiguity of meaning means that the reason and the claim are not talking about the same\nthing. The reason doesn\u2019t really lead to the claim.\nIn our assessment, we need to indicate how much of a problem the vagueness is for the overall validity of the argument.\nThis ambiguity undermines the author\u2019s claim that _____________.\nWithout knowing _____________, we cannot conclude that the author is right that _____________.\nPractice Exercise 4.2.1\nIn a few sentences, give your opinion on an issue related to current events. Make a short argument with a claim and at least one\nreason. Then, exchange arguments with a classmate. Read your classmate\u2019s argument and write down at least one clarifying\nquestion. Can you imagine a way in which two readers could get different ideas about what they mean based on what they\nwrote? Is there a term they are using that could mean more than one thing?\nHere are some ideas for phrasing such direct requests for clarification:\nYou seem to imply that _____________, but I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not that means_____________.\nCan you clarify what you\u2019re referring to when you say _____________?\nCould you define the term _____________? Some might think of _________, while others could imagine you mean\n__________.\nI\u2019m interested in the way you explore the issue of ___________, but I wasn\u2019t sure I understood what you wanted to argue in\nthe end. Did you mean _____________?\nI wondered if you meant_____________ or _____________.\nThis page titled 4.2: Check If the Meaning Is Clear is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna\nMills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n4.2.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27192 4.3: Look for Exceptions\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (7 min, 8 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 77::0088\nWhy are generalizations important to arguments?\nIn order to make a point that is worth making, we may need facts or evidence, but we will also need ways to connect those specifics\nto bigger points or other related specifics. A generalization tells us that something is true for a group of cases that have something\nin common.\nArguments depend on generalizations in various ways. Sometimes the main claim may be a generalization, and sometimes a\ngeneralization may serve as a reason. Arguments that start with a generalization and then apply it to specific cases are known as\ndeductive arguments. Those that use specific examples to arrive at a general conclusion are known as inductive arguments.\nIn either case, if an argument relies on a generalization and it turns out that generalization is not always true, that's a problem worth\nexamining.\nFind the generalizations and question them\nWe can check an argument by looking for possible exceptions to any generalization it makes. If we see a general statement, we\nshould ask ourselves whether it is true in all cases or whether we can identify any case that doesn\u2019t fit the pattern. If there is an\nexception that the argument hasn\u2019t accounted for, that may point us to a weak spot that we should mention in our assessment.\nOften, a particular claim or reason may sound plausible, but we need to slow down and ask if it is true in all cases. For example,\ntake the following argument:\nThe First Amendment guarantees the right of free speech to all Americans. Therefore,\nteachers have the right to express themselves freely in the classroom.\nThis is a deductive argument that starts with a general statement about a right of all Americans and applies it to a specific group\n(teachers) in a specific setting (the classroom). But is the general statement always true? Does the First Amendment really\nguarantee absolute freedom to say whatever we want in any situation? U.S. courts have recognized many exceptions to this\nfreedom. For example, doctors are not allowed to discuss confidential patient information without permission. No one is allowed to\ncall for immediate acts of violence. Teachers may not tell students to go out and shoot the president. \"Hate speech\" is also\nprohibited: a teacher does not have the right to spout racial slurs. Another exception that applies to this case is not so widely\nknown: the First Amendment does not apply when a person is working for an employer. Unless there is a local law protecting\nemployee speech, an employer can tell workers what they are and are not allowed to say on the job.\nThe original argument does not mention any of these exceptions. By pointing this out, we can show that the argument as expressed\nis invalid. If it isn\u2019t always true that the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, then we cannot necessarily conclude that\nteachers in classrooms are guaranteed freedom of speech. Deductive arguments depend on a generalization to reason about\nspecifics. If we disprove the generalization, we won\u2019t be able to use it to make the claim.\nExceptions are not always so damaging to an argument. Let\u2019s look at an inductive argument that uses examples to make a general\nclaim. If we uncover an exception to this general claim, it may not invalidate the whole argument. For example, let\u2019s take the\nfollowing argument:\nAcross the country, we have seen so many cases of teachers openly expressing their\npolitical beliefs in the classroom. This country\u2019s teachers behave as if their First\nAmendment rights extend to the workplace, but indoctrinating students is an abuse of\npower.\n4.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27193 We can surely think of teachers who do not express political beliefs in the classroom. An assessment could critique this argument\nfor not acknowledging that. Clearly, though, the entire argument is not invalidated by these exceptions. The claim would need to\nbe limited, perhaps by placing the word \u201csome\u201d or \u201cmany\u201d in front of \u201cteachers.\u201d\nImage by Ricardo Gomez Angel on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nPhrases for pointing out exceptions\nHere are some sample ways to critique an argument for ignoring a plausible exception:\nThe argument is based on the idea that _____________, but this is not entirely true because _____________.\nThe reason given is that _____________, but the author has not considered the possibility that, in fact, _____________.\nThe author does not acknowledge that _____________ might be the case.\nCommon types of arguments that leave out exceptions\nWe can look for exceptions with any argument, but there are two particular patterns worth learning about so we can spot them\nquickly. These patterns are known as the false dilemma fallacy and the loaded question fallacy.\nFalse dilemmas\nSometimes an argument asserts that there are only two or three options, when in fact there may be others. This is often called a\nfalse dilemma or false choice fallacy. If the writer is arguing for something that obviously has downsides, they may present it as\nthe lesser of two evils. However, we should always ask whether those two are really the only options. For example, consider the\nfollowing argument:\nAmericans are faced with a choice: either we open our borders or we turn our backs on\nthe needs of desperate people. Clearly, the only ethical course is to open our borders.\nThere are other ways to try to help desperate people. As a country, we give billions in direct aid and security assistance to\nstruggling countries every year and could conceivably give more to the countries migrants are escaping. Other possible options\nwould be to establish refugee camps at the border, or to allow people to enter the U.S. temporarily but not permanently. These\noptions may or may not be good ones, but the point is that the way this argument has presented the choice as an either\/or is\nmisleading.\nHere is a sample way to point out a false dilemma:\nThe argument presents only two possibilities,_____________ and _____________, when in fact it could be the case that\n_____________\n4.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27193 Loaded questions\nSometimes a false dilemma is implied when an argument asks a question with an obvious answer, a question phrased in such a way\nthat it pushes us to agree with the author without examining the real range of possibilities. This loaded question implies that there\nare only two options, one of them very bad. As an example, we can reframe the statement from the false dilemma example as a\nquestion and answer:\nCan we justify turning our backs on the needs of desperate people? There is no\njustification for such selfishness. The time has come to open our borders.\nThe argument would be more transparent and less manipulative if it tried to prove that other ways of helping desperate people, such\nas direct aid in people\u2019s countries of origin, would not do enough.\nWe can critique a loaded question with a sentence like this:\nThe question _____________ assumes that _____________, when, in fact, it could be that_____________.\nExercise 4.3.1\nConsider the following argument: \u201cTechnology is so much a part of all aspects of our lives now that we cannot do without it.\u201d\nWhat exceptions could you point out to either the claim, \u201cWe cannot do without it,\u201d or the reason, \u201cTechnology is so much\na part of all aspects of our lives now\u201d?\nUse one of the phrases from this section or a phrase of your own to critique the argument.\nWould the argument be valid if it just narrowed its focus? Or does the exception reveal a fundamental problem with the\nargument?\nThis page titled 4.3: Look for Exceptions is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n4.3.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27193 4.4: Decide How Strong the Evidence Is\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (17 min, 7 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1177::0077\nIs there enough evidence?\nAn argument may not have obvious exceptions, but we should still ask whether it gives enough evidence to convince us of the\nclaim. The reason is the foundation of the argument: is the foundation secure? In some cases we may suspect that some part of the\nreason is not true, and in others we may simply want to note that little or no evidence has been offered. For example, the border\nargument we have examined makes two claims without any evidence: \u201cCompletely open borders would put our security at risk\u201d\nand \u201cThere are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people.\"\nThe evidence may lack substance (circular reasoning)\nSometimes a reason given is not really a reason at all, just a repetition of the claim itself in different words. In effect, the writer\nasks us to believe an idea because of that very same idea. This is called circular reasoning or \"begging the question.\"\nFor example, consider the following argument:\nAnyone born in the United States has a right to citizenship because citizenship rights here depend on birth, not ethnicity or\nfamily history of immigration.\nThe idea that \u201canyone born in the United States has a right to citizenship\u201d and the idea that \u201ccitizenship rights here depend on\nbirth\u201d are really one and the same. We still need a reason to accept this focus on birth as the determining factor.\nCircular reasoning is often not deliberate. In reaching to explain the reason for a deeply held belief, a writer may end up\nsummarizing that belief again in a different way. Other times the writer may knowingly perform this sleight of hand, hoping the\nreader will not notice. In either case, the argument lacks substantive support.\nWe can critique circular reasoning with phrases like the following:\nThe argument presents _____________ as a reason to believe _____________, but this supposed reason is just a rewording of\nthe claim.\nThe writer provides no real justification for the idea that _____________; to convince us they just repeat that idea with different\nphrasing.\nThe evidence may not be representative (hasty generalization)\nMost academic arguments explore evidence in the form of specific examples, facts, statistics, testimonials, or anecdotes in order to\narrive at a general conclusion. This is called inductive reasoning.\nIf an argument gives evidence, we need to know if the evidence is enough. A few examples may not be representative of a general\npattern. If the argument makes a sweeping generalization based on one or two anecdotes or solely on the writer's own experience, it\ncan be considered a hasty generalization.\nHow do we decide when the evidence is enough? The science of statistics addresses this question in very specific, technical ways\nthat are worth learning but beyond the scope of this book. Often, however, an intuitive assessment will be enough. We all probably\nalready guard against this fallacy when we search online for products that have been reviewed many times. Clearly one five-star\nreview could be a fluke, but 2,000 reviews averaging 4 1\/2 stars is a more reliable indicator.\nPeople who deny that global warming is a genuine phenomenon often commit this fallacy. In February of 2015, the weather was\nunusually cold in Washington, DC. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma famously took to the Senate floor wielding a snowball. \u201cIn\n4.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27194 case we have forgotten, because we keep hearing that 2014 has been the warmest year on record, I ask the chair, \u2018You know what\nthis is?\u2019 It\u2019s a snowball, from outside here. So it\u2019s very, very cold out. Very unseasonable.\u201d\nSenator Inhofe commits the hasty generalization fallacy. He\u2019s trying to establish a general conclusion\u2014that 2014 wasn\u2019t the\nwarmest year on record, or that global warming isn\u2019t really happening. But the evidence he presents is insufficient to support such a\nclaim. His evidence is an unseasonable coldness in a single place on the planet, on a single day. We can\u2019t derive from that one\nexample any conclusions about what\u2019s happening, temperature-wise, on the entire planet, over a long period of time. The claim that\nthe earth is warming is not a claim that everywhere, at every time, it will always be warmer than it was. The claim is that, on\naverage, across the globe, temperatures are rising. Cold snaps can happen even if temperatures are rising.\nA particularly damaging example of the hasty generalization fallacy is the development of negative stereotypes. Stereotypes are\ngeneral claims about religious or racial groups, ethnicities and nationalities. Even if we do have evidence that a certain trait is more\ncommon among people of one ethnicity, we still cannot assume that a particular individual of that ethnicity will have the trait.\nA specific form of hasty generalization is when an author will point to a lack of evidence as a sign that no evidence is out there.\nThis fallacy is often called appeal to ignorance because the arguer is citing their own lack of knowledge as the basis for their\nargument.\nFor example, consider the following: \u201cNo one I know has heard about any anti-Asian violence lately; therefore, reports of such\nviolence are exaggerated.\u201d The speaker and their acquaintances may simply not have come in contact with the people who have\nexperienced such incidents of violence.\nAbsence of evidence can sometimes tell us something useful. It may be a reason to doubt the conclusion even if it doesn't disprove\nit. During the 2016 presidential campaign, reporter David Fahrenthold took to Twitter to announce that despite having \u201cspent weeks\nlooking for proof that [Donald Trump] really does give millions of his own [money] to charity...\u201d he could only find one donation,\nto the NYC Police Athletic League. Trump has claimed to have given millions of dollars to charities over the years. Does this\nreporter\u2019s failure to find evidence of such giving prove that Trump\u2019s claims about his charitable donations are false? No. To draw\nsuch a conclusion relying only on this reporter's testimony would be to commit the fallacy.\nHowever, the failure to uncover evidence of charitable giving does provide some reason to suspect Trump\u2019s claims may be false.\nHow much of a reason depends on the reporter\u2019s methods and credibility, among other things. In fact, Fahrenthold subsequently\nperformed and documented in the Washington Post on 9\/12\/16 a rather exhaustive unsuccessful search for evidence of charitable\ngiving, providing strong support for the conclusion that Trump didn\u2019t give as he\u2019d claimed.\nIs the evidence trustworthy?\nIf the writer has offered evidence, we should ask ourselves whether it is credible. Can it be verified? The validity depends on the\nsource. Is the evidence from trustworthy sources? For example, if the argument cites a statistic from the Pew Research Center, we\nneed to know whether that institution is credible. Is it biased? Does it try to promote a particular product or ideology? Do experts\nin the field review its studies? If we are not familiar with the source, we can look it up online and include this information in our\nassessment. We will discuss assessing the credibility of sources much more in Chapter 6: The Research Process and also in Chapter\n9: How Arguments Establish Trust and Connection (Ethos).\nIs there enough variety in the evidence?\nThere are different kinds of evidence and each kind has its limitations as far as what it can show. Thus, arguments are often most\nconvincing when they provide a variety of kinds of evidence. For example, an anecdote might give a sense of how difficult an\nimmigrant's situation in their country of origin may be, but a statistic on how common that difficulty is will be needed to show that\nthe anecdote is typical of many others' experiences as well. In your assessment, you may want to note the limitations of the\nevidence offered and point out another kind of evidence that would complement it. Are there enough statistics, anecdotes, or\ntestimonials? Is there enough variety in the kinds of evidence? There isn\u2019t a set formula for what\u2019s needed; the question is whether\nthe readers should be convinced that any claim that makes up part of the argument is valid.\nTypes of evidence and their limitations\nFacts\nFacts are statements that can be independently verified. For example, an argument might state that \u201cAccording to the Pew Research\nCenter, the United States has more immigrants than any other country.\u201d We could theoretically check whether the Pew Research\n4.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27194 Center issued this statement and also check whether it is true based on the census of each country as well as other population\nestimates.\nStatistics\nStatistics are numbers that are used to describe a pattern. They often represent information about a large number of cases of a\ngiven phenomenon, so they may be more convincing because they are more likely to represent a general trend than one or two\ncases might be. If the statistics are accurate and relevant, they can provide strong support. For example, an argument might cite\nevidence that according to the Pew Research Center, \u201cimmigrants today account for 13.6% of the U.S. population.\u201d Statistics have\nan air of authority because they quantify things, making them and the claim they support sound indisputable. For this reason,\nwriters can be tempted to overuse them or to throw them in where they don\u2019t really add to the logic of the argument. A famous\nbook called How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff goes over all the ways in which statistics can be used to mislead readers\nabout the strength of a claim. We need to examine closely what a given statistic actually shows and exactly how it connects to the\nclaim at stake in the argument. This will usually involve checking the assumptions made to link the statistic to the claim, as we will\nsee in Section 4.5: Check the Argument\u2019s Assumptions.\nExpert testimonials\nTestimonial evidence can be convincing if it is collected from relevant authorities. Whether or not a testimonial is convincing\ndepends not just on how well regarded the expert is but on how relevant their expertise is to the topic at hand. Who would be an\nexpert source of a testimonial for an argument based on immigration? A social scientist? A philosopher? An immigration lawyer?\nWe would want to question the testimony of a celebrity who has no special knowledge of immigration. In addition, we want to\nknow if the expert\u2019s perspective is representative of the opinion of others in the field. Is the person an extremist? Do they have a\nstake in promoting a particular product or position?\nStatements from experts or organizations that represent a field of knowledge can be especially helpful in laying the foundation for a\ndeductive argument, where we need a credible general principle as the foundation for a conclusion about a specific case. This can\nbe especially helpful if we are looking to make a prediction about a future trend or the outcome of an experiment. We will need to\ncite experts to substantiate the general principle. But the question arises whether the experts really speak for the field and whether\nothers have alternate expert interpretations of the pattern or draw other generalizations from the body of evidence.\nFor example, take the following general claim supported by expert testimony:\nAs psychiatrist Dr. Robert Spitzer of Columbia University told The Washington Post in 2001 that his study showed that, \"some\npeople can change from gay to straight, and we ought to acknowledge that.\" It\u2019s not impossible to convert to heterosexuality.\nHowever, an inquiry into Dr. Robert Spitzer will show that his 2001 study was widely criticized by other psychiatrists and that he\nhimself recanted the study and apologized for it in the journal of the American Psychiatric Association in 2012, writing, \u201cI \u2026\napologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I\nhad proven that reparative therapy works with some \u2018highly motivated\u2019 individuals.\u201d An assessment could note that at the very\nleast the argument should have mentioned this later apology when it quoted Spitzer.\nAnecdotes\nAnecdotes can illustrate a point with a story that makes it come to life. They are more compelling if they are based on first-hand\naccounts. Often these stories appeal strongly to readers' emotions, and we will discuss in much more depth how to analyze and\nevaluate these appeals in Chapter 8: How Arguments Appeal to Emotion. We should examine any story closely to see how opinions\nand assumptions may be woven into the storytelling. In our assessment, we may want to point out any possible bias or limitation of\nthe person who provides the anecdote.\nIf anecdotes or specific examples are used to establish a general pattern, we can ask how the argument convinces us that these are\ntypical. Sometimes statistics can help to establish this typicality.\nDoes the evidence really support the claim?\nThe argument may have offered some facts as evidence, and we may be ready to accept them as facts, but do they prove what the\nargument wants them to prove? Sound evidence can be used in misleading ways. As we\u2019ll see in Section 4.5: Check the\nArgument\u2019s Assumptions, a reason depends on assumptions to prove a claim. If the assumptions are wrong, then the reason does\nnot really prove the claim. This type of fallacy, or logical problem, can be called a non sequitur.\n4.4.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27194 Is the claim too broad or too definite given the evidence?\nSometimes an argument makes a broad claim based on narrow evidence. In our assessment, we can comment on any mismatch\nbetween the scope of the claim and the scope of the evidence offered. We might suggest that the argument should limit its claim\nwith a particular phrase such as with \u201cfew,\u201d \u201cmany,\u201d \u201cmost,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d or \u201cin a few cases.\u201d\nSometimes an argument makes a bold, absolute claim, but the evidence really only justifies a more tentative conclusion. We can\npoint out in our assessment that the argument lacks the appropriate qualifying words like \u201cpossibly,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201calmost\ncertainly,\u201d or \u201cin all likelihood.\u201d\nSee Section 2.8: Finding the Limits on the Argument for more ways to limit the scope or degree of certainty.\nPhrases for assessing an argument\u2019s evidence\nPraising evidence\nShe convincingly supports this claim by _____________.\nThey give many examples of _____________ to support the idea that _____________.\nHis evidence of _____________ ranges from anecdotes to large-scale academic studies to expert testimonials.\nX refers to credible academic studies of _____________ to bolster their argument that _____________.\nX refers to a number of credible experts to establish that, in general, _____________.\nCritiquing evidence\nX asserts that _____________ but does not offer any evidence.\nThe argument builds on the premise that _____________, but fails to support that premise.\nX offers scant evidence for the claim that _____________.\nThe argument gives an example to support the claim that _____________, but gives no evidence that this example is typical.\n_____________ is not enough to show that _____________.\nThe essay offers only _____________ as evidence when it should also point to _____________ and _____________.\nX\u2019s claim that _____________ is too broad given that they only give evidence related to _____________.\nThe evidence does not warrant such a definite conclusion about _____________.\nX has been a bit hasty to declare that_____________. So far, the scanty data on _____________ only warrant cautious\nspeculation.\nExercise 4.4.1\nChoose an argument you have recently read for class, or select one from Section 15.1: Suggested Short Readings.

Noticing and questioning assumptions is a core slow thinking practice in college. Beyond that, questioning\nassumptions may be one of the most powerful mental habits a human can learn.\nIn his bestseller The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, Don Miguel Ruiz advises, \u201cDon\u2019t make\nassumptions.\u201d But we do make assumptions; every belief, every argument depends on them. Perhaps Ruiz\u2019s advice is a shorthand\nway to ask us to learn to recognize our assumptions so we can decide when to set them aside.\nQuestioning assumptions is a habit we may find empowering, freeing, and useful in any area of life. Novelist Isaac Asimov put it\nanother way: \u201cYour assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in.\u201d\nDiscovering a hidden assumption can be a revelation; it suggests the possibility that things might work another way. There may be\nother angles to consider.\nQuestioning assumptions can be a way to speak back to authority. Those in power often make assumptions based on their\nprivilege, assumptions that help them stay in power. They may rationalize their decisions by justifying them with better-sounding\nreasons. The white defenders of slavery made a thousand such arguments. Abraham Lincoln responded, \u201cWhenever I hear anyone\narguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.\u201d Questioning the assumptions of such arguments can\nhelp expose their immorality and challenge the power structure.\nQuestioning the assumptions of the dominant culture can help anyone less privileged feel personally empowered. Bob Marley\nfamously sang \u201cEmancipate yourselves from mental slavery. \/\/ None but ourselves can free our minds.\u201d\nQuestioning assumptions about other people makes it possible to set aside stereotypes and connect authentically. Michelle Obama,\nin her book Becoming, calls on us to \u201cfear less, to make fewer wrong assumptions, to let go of the biases and stereotypes that\nunnecessarily divide us.\u201d\nOn a practical level, questioning assumptions can also help us problem-solve. There may be a way around a difficulty if we realize\nhow our assumptions have limited our view. By first recognizing and then changing our assumptions, we can, to use a common\nphrase, \u201cthink outside the box.\u201d\nImage by Arek Socha from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\n4.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 What assumptions does the argument make?\nMost arguments don\u2019t mention their assumptions, so summaries don\u2019t typically mention them either. However, when we assess an\nargument or write a critical analysis, we need to know whether the argument has a strong foundation. The reason might seem to\nprove the claim, but that leap from one to the other depends on assumptions. The writer may not even be aware of these ideas, but\nthey are still necessary to the argument. Philosopher Stephen E. Toulmin popularized the process of finding the assumptions that\nlink the reason to the claim. He called these warrants, and he found it useful to write them into an argument map such as the one\nbelow (see Chapter 2: Reading to Figure out the Argument for more on argument mapping).\n\"Argument Map with Assumption\" by Anna Mills is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nSee the accessible text description of the argument map with assumption.\nIn the map, the assumption goes underneath with the arrow pointing up because the assumption supports or props up the whole\nargument. Note that this assumption is similar to the Golden Rule, \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d\nArguments depend on more than one assumption. The above example also depends on the assumption that \"People currently need\npermission to cross the border legally.\" We know that under current policy, governments decide whether or not to allow people in.\nHowever, it is probably not useful to identify assumptions that are easily verified and not controversial. In fact, we do not need to\nfind every underlying assumption in order to assess an argument; we only need to know which are questionable.\nSo if we are reading an argument, how do we identify the assumptions it makes? In a few cases writers will point out their\nassumptions with phrases like the following:\nI will assume here _____________.\nThis rests on the assumption that _____________.\nOf course, this depends on _____________.\nAs we know, _____________.\nThis argument rests upon the idea that _____________.\nThe underlying principle here is that _____________.\nMore commonly, though, writers do not state assumptions, sometimes because they seem obvious and sometimes because drawing\nattention to the assumptions might draw attention to a weakness in the argument. We will need to identify these assumptions on our\nown.\nThe basic method is to ask ourselves what the reason needs to support the claim. What other idea is necessary for us to make the\nleap from reason to claim? What underlying idea does that leap depend on?\nIn the border example above, most people would probably agree that we should apply the same standards to ourselves as we do to\nothers. The border argument also depends on the assumption that \"People currently need permission to cross the border legally.\"\nBoth of those assumptions are uncontroversial, so why do we need to talk about them? In fact, we do not need to find every\npossible underlying assumption in order to assess an argument. We need to focus on assumptions that might not be true or that\nmight not be universally accepted.\n4.5.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 One way to uncover problematic assumptions is to brainstorm cases where the reason wouldn't necessarily lead to the claim. We\ncan put the reason and the claim into the following question:\nJust because [reason] does that necessarily mean that [claim]?\nIf we can think of a case in which the reason doesn't lead to the claim, then there must be a problematic assumption. We can try to\nfind this assumption by filling in the \"scenario\" blank below with a case in which the reason was true but the claim was not. This\ntechnique is sometimes called a scenario test:\nJust because [reason] that doesn't mean [claim] because it could be that...[scenario].\nFor example, in the case of the border argument, we could write, \"Just because we would feel it was right to cross the border\nwithout permission doesn't necessarily mean that we must recognize illegal crossing as ethical because it could be that...\" I am\ntempted to complete this with the idea that \"our personal feelings are not always the best guide to ethics.\" Or I could complete it\nwith a more specific case: \"It might be that crossing without permission isn't really right even though some people might feel it is.\"\nThis helps us to identify another assumption--that we can tell if something is ethical by whether or not it feels right.\n\"Questionable Assumption Argument Map\" by Anna Mills is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nSee the accessible text description of the questionable assumption map.\nLike a house, an argument needs a solid foundation.\nPhoto by Cindy Tang on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nAre the assumptions valid?\n4.5.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 Look for exceptions to the assumptions\nIf we want to test an assumption, we can look to cases unrelated to our argument that might prove it wrong. We can probably think\nof a person who sincerely believes they are doing right, while we are sure their action is unethical. A suicide bomber may believe\nthey are doing God's will by killing people. We can use such a counterexample to help us argue that the assumption in question is\nnot universally true and thus the reason does not necessarily imply the claim.\nLook for evidence for the assumptions\nIn the rare case that an argument lists its assumptions and explains why they are justified, we can check whether we find these\njustifications convincing. More often, though, the author will not have stated the assumptions or provided evidence to support\nthem. Our critique is a place to call for evidence of any key assumption we have uncovered. We don\u2019t have to make a final\npronouncement on whether the assumption is true or not; we may not have formed an opinion on that yet. We may be inclined to\ndoubt it or to believe it, but either way, we should point out when the assumption needs support. (Philosopher Stephen Toulmin\ncalled support for an assumption \u201cbacking\u201d so you may see that term used in other rhetoric textbooks).\nFor example, the argument below relies on the idea that chronic stress is bad for health:\nReason: According to Penn Medicine News, \u201cexposure to weight bias and stigma . . . can lead to a physiological stress\nresponse such as increased inflammation and cortisol levels.\u201d\nClaim: Fat-shaming may be one cause of the health problems associated with being fat.\nAssumption: Chronic stress leads to health problems.\nWe can check if this assumption is valid by consulting a range of reputable medical journals, and we will find many statements and\nstudies that back it up. For example, the popular and well-regarded site MayoClinic.org includes an article with the title, \u201cChronic\nstress puts your health at risk\u201d and lists effects from heart disease to memory impairment.\nCommon problems with assumptions\nAssuming a logical connection where there isn\u2019t one\nSometimes an argument leaps from a reason to a claim that is not really related. This problem is known generally as a non\nsequitur, which is Latin for \u201cIt does not follow.\u201d The scenario test will turn up cases like this. Again, we ask ourselves Just\nbecause [reason] does that necessarily mean that [claim]?\n\"Non Sequitur\" by mikecogh on Flickr is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\nWhen we use the phrase \u201cnon sequitur\u201d in conversation, we usually mean that a statement seems random or out of place. However,\nin argument non sequiturs often sound convincing and not random at all. On closer examination we see that logically speaking, the\nreason does not necessarily make the claim true. For example, let\u2019s take the assertion that \u201cOverseas Filipino workers (O.F.W.s) are\nnot citizens in the countries where they work, so they have no legal rights.\u201d Just because workers are not citizens does not mean\n4.5.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 that they have no legal rights. People can have legal rights without being citizens although the law may treat citizens and non-\ncitizens differently in some cases.\nOne special case where a logical connection is missing is known as a red herring fallacy or a fallacy of distraction. We commit the\nred herring fallacy if we attempt to distract the audience from the main thread of an argument, taking things off in a different\ndirection. The diversion is often subtle, with the detour starting on a topic closely related to the original\u2014but gradually wandering\noff into unrelated territory. The tactic is often, but not always, intentional: if the arguer is not comfortable arguing about a particular\ntopic on the merits, they change the subject to an issue about which they feel more confident and pretend to have won the original\nargument.\n\"Red Herring\" by Laurel Russwurm on Flickr is licensed under CC0.\nThe red herring fallacy gets its name from the actual fish. When herring are smoked, they turn red and are quite pungent. Stinky\nthings can be used to distract hunting dogs, who of course follow the trail of their quarry by scent; if you pass over that trail with a\nstinky fish and run off in a different direction, the hound may be distracted and follow the wrong trail.\nAn argument like the following is a good example of the red herring fallacy:\nOur staff sanitize every classroom surface multiple times throughout the day. Therefore, our school is a leader in stopping the\nspread of Covid 19.\nDuring the Covid 19 pandemic, many people and institutions have focused on what Atlantic writer Derek Thompson called\n\u201chygiene theater\u201d--the tendency to showcase practices like sanitizing surfaces beyond their actual protective value. This continued\neven after scientists had known for some time that airborne transmission was much more common than transmission through\nsurfaces. The focus on surface hygiene diverted attention away from mask-wearing and ventilation systems, which were more\nstatistically effective in preventing transmission.\nAssuming two things are comparable\nFalse analogy\nMany arguments rely on a similarity between two things, usually referred to as an analogy, to conclude that if something is true for\none, it will be true for the other. But things that are similar will also have differences, and so for any such argument we need to ask\nwhether there are any differences significant enough to change the outcome. Are the two things really similar enough to justify the\nconclusion? If not, we have what is often called a false analogy fallacy.\nFor example, consider the following argument:\nPeople have a First Amendment right to express opinions by donating money to political candidates, so corporations should\nalso have that right.\nThis is a summary of the decision the Supreme Court came to in the landmark 2010 decision Citizens United vs. FEC. It depends\non an analogy between corporations and people, an idea called \"corporate personhood\" in legal terms. Chief Justice Roberts argued,\nessentially, that the First Amendment applies to groups of people, such as corporations, as well as to individuals. Now, is this a\nfallacy? In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens argued that the Constitution was intended to apply to \"We, the People,\" not\ncorporate entities. He listed the key differences that led him to conclude that:\nIn the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Although they\nmake enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote or run for office.\nBecause they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the\ninterests of eligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate\nconcerns about their role in the electoral process. Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a\ndemocratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local\nand national races.\n4.5.5 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 As we can see, Justice Stevens thought that this was a case of false analogy, but Chief Justice Roberts disagreed. Introducing the\nfallacy label here does not resolve the debate, but it may help to clarify where the disagreement lies.\nAre apples and oranges too different to compare? \"Like apples and oranges\" by Sarah Braun on Flickr is licensed under CC BY NC\nSA 2.0.\nSlippery slope\nOne type of invalid comparison comes in arguments that make a dramatic prediction that if one thing happens, other more dramatic\nthings will inevitably follow. It depends on the idea that the first event is comparable to the other, more dramatic events. A\nslippery slope argument claims a disastrous cascade effect will take place if we take certain action. It presents a chain of events\nleading to disaster as if it is unstoppable or highly probable. But how slippery is the slope really? How likely is the disaster? Are\nthere factors that could stop the chain reaction?\nFor example, take the following argument:\nIf we allow people to self-identify their gender regardless of their biology, they will expect to be able to self-identify their race\nand then their age and species. Next thing we know, the law will demand we pretend a person is a gorilla!\nThere is a certain appealing momentum to these arguments: we imagine a boulder rolling down a hill. But will one thing really\nlead to another? Just because we can imagine that one thing might lead to another does not mean that it inevitably will. Many\ntransgender people already legally claim a gender identity different from the one they were assigned at birth. However, very few\npeople believe themselves to be a different age than their chronological age or a species other than human. There is no movement\nto push for legal recognition of self-identified age or species.\nIf it falls, this boulder will not roll far; the slope is not slippery. Photo by Prashant Kumar on Pixahive, licensed under CC0.\n4.5.6 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 Fallacious slippery slope arguments have long been deployed to resist social change. Those opposed to the abolition of slavery\nwarned of economic collapse and social chaos. Those who opposed women\u2019s suffrage asserted that it would lead to the dissolution\nof the family, rampant sexual promiscuity, and social anarchy. Of course, none of these dire predictions came true; the slopes\nweren\u2019t slippery.\nWe can critique a slippery slope argument with phrases like the following:\nThe argument claims that _____________ will inevitably lead to _____________, but this is far from certain.\nThey assume that _____________ will set off a chain reaction leading to _____________; however this is unlikely because\n_____________.\n(We can also think of the slippery slope arguments as committing the fallacy of false analogy. We saw above that one argument\nagainst letting people identify their own gender depended on a comparison between gender identity and other forms of identity\nsuch as species and age, but most would argue that key differences between these categories would lead to different legal treatment.\nThe differences would stop the slide down the slope. Faulty arguments can often legitimately be classed under different fallacy\nlabels.)\nAssuming that one thing causes another\nArguments often claim casually that an earlier event caused a later event. To be sound, such arguments need quite a bit of support.\nThey need to show that there is a likely way in which the first event could cause the second. They need to ask if something else\nhave caused the second event. Could a third factor have caused both events? Maybe the first event contributed to the second, but\nother factors did as well. Or maybe there is no link between the two events at all.\nAssuming that a first event caused a second without further justification is a fallacy variously referred to as false cause, doubtful\ncause, post hoc ergo propter hoc, post hoc, post hoc reasoning, or with the catchphrase \u201ccorrelation is not causation.\u201d Once we look\nfor it, we see it everywhere, including on the news and in reputable academic settings.\nOne example lies in the way we evaluate the performance of presidents of the United States. Everything that happens during or\nimmediately after their administrations tends to be pinned on them. But presidents aren\u2019t all-powerful; they don\u2019t cause everything\nthat happens during their presidencies. Similar claims on behalf of state governors are even more absurd. At the 2016 Republican\nNational Convention, Governors Scott Walker and Mike Pence\u2014of Wisconsin and Indiana, respectively\u2014both pointed to record-\nhigh employment in their states as vindication of their conservative policies. But some other states were also experiencing record-\nhigh employment at the time: California, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Washington. Yes, they were all controlled by\nDemocrats. Maybe there\u2019s a separate cause for those strong jobs numbers in differently governed states? Possibly it has something\nto do with the improving economy and health of the job market in the country as a whole.\nProving that one thing caused another can be tricky. We talk more about various strategies for showing causation in Section 7.5:\nCausal Arguments.\nPhrases for critiquing assumptions\nOnce we have identified an assumption that we want to question, we can introduce the assumption and explain its weakness with it\nwith phrases like the following:\n_____________relies on the idea that _____________; however, _____________.\nThe argument assumes that _____________ without providing evidence.\n_____________takes for granted that _____________, but we may wonder whether this is a justified assumption\nbecause_____________.\n_____________depends on the assumption that_____________. Is this always the case? Some might say that _____________.\n_____________ depends on a belief in _____________, which may not be shared by all readers because _____________.\nThe underlying idea here is that _____________; however we must ask ourselves whether _____________.\nThe implicit assumption is that _____________ but some may question whether, in fact, _____________.\n4.5.7 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 Attributions\nThe above is original content by Anna Mills, except for the descriptions of the red herring, slippery slope, and post hoc ergo\npropter hoc fallacies, which Anna Mills adapted from the \"Informal Logical Fallacies\" chapter of Fundamental Methods of\nLogic by Matthew Knachel, UWM Digital Commons, licensed CC BY.\n4.5: Check the Argument's Assumptions is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n4.5.8 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/28010 4.6: Check How Well the Argument Addresses Counterarguments\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (5 min, 48 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 55::4488\nDid they overlook a counterargument?\nWe may have already uncovered counterarguments that were left out when we looked for exceptions to the argument and faulty\nassumptions. Still, it\u2019s worth asking ourselves if there\u2019s any other objection the argument should have addressed. We can mention\nany compelling or popular counterargument in our critique.\nHere are three ways to brainstorm counterarguments:\n1. Try out the phrases often used to introduce counterarguments\nScan the common phrases used to introduce counterarguments listed in Section 2.6: Finding the Counterarguments. Does a\nparticular phrase suggest any counterarguments that could apply in the case of the argument you are assessing?\n2. Imagine a lively, informal conversation on the topic\nThis can help get our minds going. Instead of the more formal phrase \u201cThis way of thinking is completely wrong,\u201d why not\nconsider the argument we\u2019re assessing and then try out the phrase, \u201cWhat, are you crazy? You think _____________? But\nhaven\u2019t you considered_____________?\u201d\n3. Take a different perspective\nAsk ourselves if there is any particular group of people or school of thought likely to object to the argument. What would they\nsay? For example, if we are assessing an argument by a Democratic politician, we can ask ourselves what a Republican might\nsay in response. Or, if we are assessing an argument promoting capitalism, we can ask ourselves what a socialist\ncounterargument might be.\nWho would disagree with the argument and why? Photo by Markus Spiske from Pexels, under\nthe Pexels License.\nIs the description of the counterargument fair and accurate?\nIf an argument describes counterarguments, we have to wonder whether it gets them right. Often, a writer may be tempted to\nsummarize the other side in a distorted way, to exaggerate the counterargument in order to make it easier to disprove. This goes by\nthe name of the straw man fallacy. For example, consider these two exaggerated descriptions of political parties\u2019 positions:\n4.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118327 Democrats want completely open borders.\nRepublicans want to kick all immigrants out of America.\nThis fallacy involves the misrepresentation of an opponent\u2019s viewpoint\u2014an exaggeration or distortion of it that renders it\nindefensible, something nobody in their right mind would agree with. You make your opponent out to be an extremist, then declare\nthat you don\u2019t agree with their made-up position. Thus, you merely appear to defeat your opponent: your real opponent doesn\u2019t\nhold the crazy view you imputed to them; instead, you\u2019ve defeated a distorted version of them, one of your own making, one that is\neasily dispatched. Instead of taking on the real person, you construct one out of straw, thrash it, and pretend to have achieved\nvictory. It works if your audience doesn\u2019t realize what you\u2019ve done, if they believe that your opponent really holds the crazy view.\nIf an argument constructs and defeats a straw man, it is really only defeating a made up debate. But this distraction only works if\nthe audience believes the straw man is the real thing. We can detect the distortion by checking the description of the other side\nagainst what the other side has actually commonly argued.\nA straw man, like an exaggerated version of an argument, is easy to knock down. Photo by\nSkitterphoto from Pexels, licensed CC0.\nIs the rebuttal convincing?\nWe should remember to ask the same critical questions about the author\u2019s response to counterarguments as we do about the main\nargument itself. Counterarguments and rebuttals are often left to stand on their own. As we assess the argument, we should test\nthese as well to see if they might be incorrect or might need additional support. Is there a better way to disprove the\ncounterargument?\n4.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118327 Does the argument offer a credible perspective on any likely objections? Image by Mariana\nAnatoneag from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nPhrases for assessing the handling of counterarguments\nPraise for the handling of counterarguments\nThe author effectively counters the common view that _____________ by arguing that, in fact, _____________.\nThe writer acknowledges that _____________ but explains that this is because _____________.\nThe argument responds to the _____________ critique of their position by noting that _____________.\nCritique of the handling of counterarguments\nThe argument fails to mention the opposing view that _____________.\nThe author attempts to respond to critics by claiming that _____________, but this response is not convincing because\n_____________.\nExercise 4.6.1\nPick an argument on a controversial topic.

If we do not uncover any\nweaknesses as we review the argument\u2019s logical structure, use of evidence, and handling of counterarguments, then we can\nnaturally describe those as strengths.\nHowever, even if we do find weaknesses, it\u2019s important to recognize any contributions as well. Doing so will show readers that our\nassessment is fair-minded. An assessment can be precise about what holds up to scrutiny and what doesn\u2019t. Even if the argument is\nfatally flawed, it may still contain some valuable insight or move the conversation forward in another way. We might conclude that\nan argument is not valid, but still see ways in which this argument can help us get closer to the truth on a particular topic. At the\nvery least, if we see nothing redeeming in the article itself, we can pull a lesson or an insight out of our own experience of\nassessing it.\nThe following sections outline some ways we can point to strengths in an argument.\nPhoto by George Pagan III on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nPraise part of the argument\nAfter we zero in on the weakness, we can highlight whatever parts of the argument proved to be sound. If we are assessing an\nargument that is developed over the course of one or more pages, there will be many related claims and reasons. The reasoning in\none section might be valid even if the next point has us wincing or wanting to rant.\nOften, inductive arguments might present evidence that is suggestive, intriguing or compelling even if it does not leave us\ncompletely convinced of the conclusions the authors draw. For example, an assessment of an argument about UFOs might\nconclude, \u201cAlthough X\u2019s speculation that UFOs have abducted people seems unjustified given the scant data, their factual\nrecounting of the details of two credible sightings of UFOs does convince us that they are probably real.\u201d\nHere are some sample phrases for praising a subsection of an argument:\nAlthough the argument does not succeed in proving that _____________, it does help us understand _____________.\nThough the evidence X presents does not prove _____________, it does provide rich material for further discussion.\nX\u2019s conclusion that _____________ doesn\u2019t seem fully justified, but the evidence does show that _____________.\nX makes an important point when they note that _____________.\nX\u2019s insight into _____________ sheds new light on _____________.\n4.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118415 X clearly outlines the problem of _____________, even though their solution leaves much to be desired.\nThis piece does clarify the nature of _____________ even though it does not _____________.\nWe may find value in a piece of the argument if not the whole. Image by PIRO4D from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nPraise the argument for bringing attention to an issue\nSometimes we see value not in the content of the argument but in the focus it brings to a topic. Perhaps the argument shows why\nsomething is urgent or relevant. For example, let\u2019s imagine we want to assess a proposal for a law that stops mentally ill people\nfrom buying guns. It might say, \u201cThis proposal draws attention to the terrifying consequences of the lack of social support for\npeople with mental illness. Yet the decision to focus gun control legislation on this population only stigmatizes it further.\u201d\nWe can praise an argument for drawing attention to something with phrases like these:\nX brings much-needed attention to the issue of _____________, which is helpful because_____________.\nThe essay drives home the need for more focus on _____________.\nThis piece highlights the urgent situation of _____________.\nPraise the argument for framing an issue in a useful way\nSometimes an argument\u2019s value lies in its particular approach to an issue. We may not agree with all of the reasoning but may feel\nthat the argument frames its topic in a useful way. A fresh way to think about something could lead to other insights in other\narguments.\nFor example, here is an assessment of a book about nurse practitioners that focuses on how an argument approaches its subject:\nIn her book More than Medicine: Nurse Practitioners and the Problems They Solve for Patients, Health Care Organizations, and\nthe State, sociologist LaTonya Trotter argues that nurse practitioners often help patients with problems that are not medical at all.\nHer great contribution to the study of this profession is to frame nurse practitioners not as substitute doctors but as first responders\nto the crisis of poverty.\nWe can praise the framing of an argument with phrases like the following:\nX\u2019s discussion of _____________ provides a new way to think about _____________.\nThe argument\u2019s biggest contribution lies in its framing of _____________ as _____________.\nPraise it for raising an important question\nSometimes an argument points toward something worth considering even if it doesn\u2019t convince us completely. It may raise an\nimportant question for further discussion or study. For example, let\u2019s take this sentence from an assessment of a book about\nAmerica\u2019s mental health crisis: \u201cSheila Chin asks a crucial question: how can doctors and therapists collaborate to learn more about\nthe links between physical and mental health?\u201d\nHere are some ways to praise an argument for pointing out a question:\nX\u2019s focus on _____________ helps clarify an important question for further exploration: _____________?\nThe argument points toward the need for further study of _____________ to determine _____________.\nX\u2019s analysis reveals the gaps in our understanding of _____________.\n4.7.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118415 By raising a question, an argument can help move a conversation forward. Image by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay under\nthe Pixabay License.\nPraise it for clarifying a position\nEven if we find the reasoning flawed, we may want to give the argument some credit for articulating that reasoning. Laying out the\nreasons and evidence for a claim at least facilitates critical thinking about the topic. It may lay bare the underpinnings of a common\nbelief and enable more substantive discussion of that belief.\nFor example, let\u2019s take this excerpt from a review of a Heritage Foundation article by Ryan T. Anderson entitled, \u201cTransgender\nIdeology Is Riddled With Contradictions. Here Are the Big Ones\u201d:\nAnderson\u2019s attack on transgender identity does clearly represent the reasoning of those who object to recognizing transgender\nidentity. Thus, it provides opportunities for transgender activitsts to clarify their own positions and correct common\nmisconceptions.\nWe can praise an argument for clarity with phrases like the following:\nThis piece clearly articulates the case that _____________.\nThe argument lays bare the assumptions on which the whole case for _____________ is based.\nX has clarified the reasoning that underpins the common opinion that _____________.\nExercise 4.7.1\nPick an argument you disagree with. It might be one you have recently read for class or an argument you commonly hear in\neveryday life. Describe a strength you can genuinely appreciate in it.

Finding a problem, however, does not necessarily mean\nthe argument is completely invalid. In the process of summarizing and then questioning all the aspects of an argument, we will\nprobably identify many strengths and\/or flaws. These form the starting point for an overall assessment.\nThink of the parallel to a Yelp or Amazon review of a product. We might appreciate some aspects of the product and have\nfrustrations with others, but we need to decide how many stars to give it and we need to have a short caption for our whole review.\nThen in the text of the review, we can explain why we rated the product the way we did in more detail, exploring the particular\nstrengths and weaknesses.\nCustomer Icon by EcommDesign on Iconscout.com, licensed CC BY 3.0.\nEven though we don\u2019t give stars when we write a paper assessing the strength of an argument, readers will still want an overall\nsense of how strong or weak we find the argument to be. How serious are any flaws? To write an essay assessing the argument, we\nhave to decide what to emphasize in our thesis statement or topic sentence. Neither of these needs to mention everything we found\nwhen assessing the argument; it can focus on one or two highlights.\nSometimes we come away from an argument with a very clear sense of what the most important strengths or weaknesses are. Other\ntimes, as we are practicing slow thinking and doing a thorough job of considering the argument from many angles, we will need\nsome strategies to figure out what to emphasize.\nSort the strengths and weaknesses into categories\nOne place to start is to make a list of the strengths and weaknesses of the argument that emerged as we checked the argument for\nclarity, evidence, assumptions, exceptions, and counterarguments. Let\u2019s take the example of an assessment of Swigart\u2019s border\nargument, \u201cThe Weight of the World\u201d which we summarized in Section 3.9: Comparing and Contrasting Arguments. Let\u2019s say that\nwe have applied all the assessment strategies described earlier in this chapter and come up with the following list of strengths and\nweaknesses.\nSample list of strengths and weaknesses\nSwigart relies on the idea that all Americans consider themselves American first, human second; however, many Americans\nbelieve the opposite and maintain that alleviating human suffering is their first moral duty.\nSwigart writes, \u201cAn influx of immigration\u2026 strains a nation's resources.\u201d This ignores the fact that immigrants bring in at least\nas much as they take in the form of labor. Entire sectors of industry rely on the labor of immigrants.\n4.8.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118496 Swigart asserts that illegal immigration endangers national security, but she fails to support the claim, while ignoring evidence\nthat illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than American citizens.\nSwigart gives a distorted version of the argument for supporting refugees when she writes, \u201cIt is unjust, impractical, and\nunrealistic for one nation to solve the problems of so many non-citizens.\u201d No one is arguing that we have to solve all the\nproblems of people who immigrate. Also, the focus in this sentence on the problems of non-citizens distracts us from the fact\nthat immigrants actually solve some problems for American citizens.\nSwigart sees only two extreme options for managing the border, an open border or a closed one, when in fact there are other\nstrategies for maintaining security.\nSwigart assumes that breaking the law is by definition unethical, but she has not considered Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s contention\nthat, in fact, we are obligated to disobey ordinances that are morally wrong.\nStrategies for organizing the list\nPhoto by Mike Sansone on Flickr, licensed CC BY 2.0.\nAs we read the list of strengths and weaknesses, we can try these techniques to help us come up with a much shorter overview:\nTry putting the strengths and weaknesses in order from most important to least important. This may help us decide what to\nhighlight in our thesis.\nLook for something that one or more of the strengths and\/or weaknesses have in common. Can we group some of them\ntogether? Is there a larger category they fall into? If we can combine two or more under one category, then we only need to\nmention that category in the thesis rather than listing the individual points.\nIn the case of the assessment of Swigart\u2019s \u201cThe Weight of the World,\u201d we may notice that the first and last points are about ethics\nand morality. The rest of them critique the evidence Swigart offers about practical considerations of cost and benefit for American\ncitizens.\nIf the moral critique seems most important to us, we could focus on it in our thesis thus:\nThesis: Swigart\u2019s argument on immigration policy is fatally flawed because it does not\nconsider any moral basis for our behavior toward people who are trying to enter the\nUnited States. It offers only national self-interest as a motivating factor.\nOn the other hand, if the practical issue of costs and benefits seems more important, we might come up with a thesis statement like\nthis:\nThesis: Ultimately, Swigart\u2019s argument fails to convince because it is based on faulty\nevidence that immigration is bad for American citizens. She ignores the ways immigration\nbenefits American citizens economically and results in lower crime rates.\nPhrases for overall assessments\nIn our overall assessment, we want to make it clear to what extent we agree, disagree, or partially agree with an argument. Here are\na few phrases we can use:\n4.8.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118496 Positive assessments\nX offers an important contribution to our understanding of ____________ by showing that ____________.\nWith sound reasoning and evidence, X presents a convincing case for ____________.\nAll in all, X makes a compelling argument that ____________.\nMixed positive and negative assessments\nWhile X makes an important point about ____________, they fail to explain ____________.\nAlthough the argument ____________ has some merit, we should question____________.\nX makes a plausible case for ____________, but they don\u2019t give enough evidence to convince us fully that ____________.\nX makes some valid observations on ____________, but their conclusion that ____________ is wrong because ____________.\nNegative assessments\nX completely fails to convince us of ____________, largely because ____________.\nThe fatal flaw in X\u2019s argument is that ____________.\nThe problem with X\u2019s whole approach is that it ignores something crucial: ____________.\nImage by Marek Studzinski from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nOrganizing the assessment essay\nOnce we have the overview or thesis of our assessment, we will need to decide how and in what order to explain the details. In\nmost cases, an assessment starts with a summary of the argument. We don\u2019t assume our readers have also read the argument we are\ntalking about.\nIf our overall assessment has more than one part, we might consider dedicating a paragraph or more to each part with explanation\nand support. Strengths and weaknesses from our original list might each be explored in a whole paragraph of an assessment essay.\nIn a shorter assessment, we might spend a sentence or two explaining each point before moving on to the next. For an example of a\nparagraph-long assessment, see the final paragraph of the Sample Assessment: \u201cTypography and Identity.\u201d\nSample assessment essay outline\nLet\u2019s take one of the sample theses assessing Swigart\u2019s \u201cThe Weight of the World\u201d and look at one way to organize an essay based\non it.\nThesis: Ultimately, Swigart\u2019s argument fails to convince because it is based on faulty evidence that immigration is bad for\nAmerica. She ignores the ways in which immigration benefits American citizens and results in lower crime rates.\nParagraph 1: Summarize and critique Swigart\u2019s evidence that undocumented immigrants pose a security risk.\nParagraph 2: Summarize and critique Swigart\u2019s evidence that needy immigrants would disproportionately use expensive social\nservices.\nParagraph 3: Point out the need to factor in the labor and tax contributions of immigrants when assessing the financial picture.\n4.8.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118496 The next step: making our own recommendation\nGiven the strengths and weaknesses we\u2019ve uncovered, we probably have our own ideas to add about how to build on the writer\u2019s\npoints, fix the argument, or offer a different way to look at the issue. There are many ways to follow up on your critique, as we will\nsee in the next chapter on making recommendations in response to an argument.\nExercise 4.8.1\nImagine that you have made the following list of strengths and weaknesses of the argument \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the\nBorder?\u201d that we looked at in Chapters 2 and 3. Come up with at least two groups of points that have something in common.\nFor each group, write a possible thesis statement that combines the points and emphasizes their importance.\nMills assumes that we should base our moral standards on our feelings, but she does not justify or defend this idea.\nMills does not explain how it could be possible to ensure security without stopping people who don\u2019t have permission from\ncrossing the border.\nMills\u2019 argument depends on finding a way to distinguish between people who genuinely have no other option but to escape\ntheir countries of origin and those who simply prefer to live in the U.S.\nMills does not consider that our personal concern for our families can lead to unethical actions. For example, some people\nuse their influence in unfair ways to do favors for family members.\nMills mentions a counterargument about security but does not go into any detail about how serious the threats are.\nMills assumes that an impoverished family would be making a good decision by immigrating to the U.S., when in fact such\na decision would involve many dangers and costs.\nMills assumes that the only way the U.S. could help desperate people in other countries would be by allowing them to\nimmigrate.\nMills provides no researched, real-life examples of desperate undocumented immigrants and their reasons for immigrating.\nMills reminds us of something fundamental: our immigration policy should follow the Golden Rule: we must treat others as\nwe would want to be treated.\nAttribution\nWritten by Saramanda Swigart and adapted by Anna Mills, licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nThis page titled 4.8: Come up with an Overall Assessment is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nSaramanda Swigart.\n4.8.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/118496 4.9: Fallacies List\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (1 min, 19 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 11::1199\nIn this chapter we have discussed logical problems according to categories, but we can also list the traditional terms for these\nfallacies or illegitimate argumentative strategies.

(Note: The opening statement provides the\nessay's overall context: the effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic.) However, its effects will be long-lasting. (Note: The follow-up\nstatement introduces the essay's particular focus: the impact of the Pandemic on women.) While the Pandemic has affected\neveryone\u2019s lives in every aspect, its impacts on women are even more severe. Helen Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Coronavirus Is a\nDisaster for Feminism\u201d explains why feminism cannot survive during the Pandemic. (Note: An outside text is introduced that the\nessay will engage with.) Lewis starts her article with a complaint by saying \u201cenough already\u201d because, in terms of housework\nespecially for child care, there has been an inequality since the past. This inequality has become even more explicit with the\ncoronavirus outbreak. Women have to shoulder not only more housework but also childcare more than ever due to school closures.\nThe Pandemic started as a public health crisis and brought along an economic one. Women are mainly affected by this crisis more\nthan men because women are more likely to take housework and childcare responsibilities while men are expected to work and\n\u201cbring home the bacon.\u201d (Note: The author provides a clear thesis statement to close the opening (introduction) paragraph).)\nEach gender has a different role in society. While men are usually seen as breadwinners, women mostly spend their time at home\nand do housework. (Note: The first supporting argument: the unpaid labor of women under traditional gender roles.) Women also\nare the primary caregivers both children and elders. As Lewis mentions, the \u201clooking after\u201d duty is on women\u2019s shoulders. Then\nshe adds \u201c all this looking after\u2014this unpaid caring labor\u2014will fall more heavily on women because of the existing structure of the\nworkforce,\u201d and she includes a provocative question from Clare Wenham, an assistant professor of global health policy at the\nLondon School of Economics: \u201cWho is paid less? Who has the flexibility?\u201d The author intentionally uses this quote to express her\nfrustration. At the same time, she implies that this existing structure is based upon the gender pay gap. (Note: The author supports\nher argument with evidence from the text, and provides analysis to tie that evidence to her argument.) We all are familiar with the\nreality that \u201cwomen\u2019s income is less than men\u2019s\u201d so this fact goes a long way towards explaining why women mainly stay at home\nand take caregiving responsibilities. It is a kind of survival rule that whoever earns less should stay at home. In this case, it seems\nlike couples do not have many options.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the Pandemic for dual-income parents is the school and daycare closures. (Note: Whereas\nthe first support focused on gender roles, the second paragraph focuses on the particular challenges for parents during the Covid-19\nepidemic.) These dual-earner parents should find a way to split children\u2019s needs during the shelter-in-place. If they do not balance\npaid work and child care, both sides will feel the consequences. To emphasize these consequences, Lewis humorously says \u201cDual-\nincome couples might suddenly be living like their grandparents, one homemaker, and one breadwinner.\u201d (Note: Drawing on\nevidence from the text, this passage shows how gender roles relate to the challenges of Covid-19 for working parents and families.)\nInstead of splitting the housework, women take the role of \u201chomemaker\u201d so the author implies here that this regresses gender\ndynamics two generations backward. It obviously demonstrates that nothing much has changed over time and the mentality\nremains. While many couples are trying to find a middle way, others think that women have to suck it up and sacrifice their jobs.\n4.11.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92730 In reference to school closures, Lewis brings up the Ebola health crisis which occurred in West Africa in the time period of 2014-\n2016. (Note: The following paragraph cites a historical precedent for the Covid-19 outbreak as a basis for comparison.) According\nto Lewis, during this outbreak, many African girls lost their chance at education; moreover, many women died during childbirth\nbecause of a lack of medical care. Mentioning these elaborations proves once again that not only coronavirus but also many other\noutbreaks have caused a disaster for feminism. Pandemics, in other words, pile yet another problem on women who always face an\nuphill battle against patriarchal structures. (Note: This passage ties this observation about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to a\ngreater observation about Pandemics and gender roles overall.)\nI started reading her article with a feeling of frustration. While the main topic of the article is feminism, Lewis gives a couple of\nmale examples from the past, such as William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton. (Note: The author makes a personal note here,\nmarking an emotional connection and reaction to the text.) She seems at times to attribute their success to their masculinity. They\nboth lived in times of plague, demonstrating that despite all our progress, the human species is still grappling with the same issues.\nAccording to Lewis, neither Newton nor Shakespeare had to worry about childcare or housework. Even though her comparison\nseemed odd to me, she managed to surprise me that in over 300 years many gender inequities remain the same. This is actually\nvery tragic. It is hard to acknowledge that women are still facing gender inequality in almost every area even 300 years after the\ntime of these great English thinkers. (Note: The author cites historical precedent again: this passage argues that the relationship\nbetween plagues and gender roles has not changed much in centuries.) Assuming housework is the natural place of women without\nasking women if they want to do it is asking for too big a sacrifice. Since couples have the option to split the housework and\nchildcare, why should only women have to shoulder most of the burden? This is a question that I might never be able to answer,\neven if I search my whole life. It is unacceptable that there is pressure on women to conform to gender roles, such as cultural\nsettings and expectations. (Note: The author uses a rhetorical question to segue into a new supporting argument.) Women should\nnot have to sacrifice their leisure time completing unpaid work. I agree with Lewis when she mentions the \u201csecond shift\u201d situation.\nWhen we consider women\u2019s first shift as their paid work, the second shift represents the time that they spend working in the home.\nIn this case, there is apparently no shift for leisure time. Lewis also supports this by saying \u201cAcross the world, women\u2014including\nthose with jobs\u2014do more housework and have less leisure time than their male partners.\u201d Additionally, it seems like economic\nrecovery is going to be long-lasting because of the Coronavirus. As a solution, if men and women have equal housework\nresponsibilities, women may spend more of their time completing paid work. (Note: The author makes a call to action near the end\nof the essay.) In this way, they can contribute to the economy while they are socializing. Especially after the Pandemic is over, we\nwill need a greater workforce, so hopefully, both men and women can equally participate in the economy. (Note: Much like the first\nsentence of the essay, the last sentence speaks to a greater, big-picture context: the need for equality in a post-pandemic world.)\nAttribution\nThis sample essay was written by Gizem Gur and edited by Anna Mills.

For a more traditional visual format, see (cid:0)the PDF version of \"Typography and Identity.\"\nSample Essay Z\nEnglish 1C\nProf. Saramanda Swigart\nTypography and Identity\nJohn Eligon's New York Times article, \u201cA Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans \u2018Black\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019?\u201d\noutlines the ongoing conversation among journalists and academics regarding conventions for writing about race\u2014specifically,\nwhether or not to capitalize the \u201cb\u201d in \u201cblack\u201d when referring to African-Americans (itself a term that is going out of style). (Note:\nThe opening sentence introduces the text this essay will respond to and gives a brief summary of the text's content.) Eligon argues\nthat, while it might seem like a minor typographical issue, this small difference speaks to the question of how we think about\nrace in the United States. Are words like \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d mere adjectives, descriptors of skin color? Or are they proper nouns,\nindicative of group or ethnic identity? Eligon observes that until recently, with the prominence of the Black Lives Matter\nmovement, many journalistic and scholarly publications tended to use a lowercase \u201cblack,\u201d while Black media outlets typically\ncapitalized \u201cBlack.\u201d He suggests that the balance is now tipping in favor of \"Black,\" but given past changes, usage will probably\nchange again as the rich discussion about naming, identity, and power continues. (Note: The thesis statement includes two related\nideas explored by Eligon: the current trend toward using \"Black\" and the value of the ongoing discussion that leads to changing\nterms.)\nEligon points to a range of evidence that \"Black\" is becoming the norm, including a recent change by \"hundreds of news\norganizations\" including the Associated Press. This comes in the wake of the George Floyd killing, but it also follows a longtime\nBlack press tradition exemplified by newspapers like The New York Amsterdam News. Eligon cites several prominent academics\nwho are also starting to capitalize Black. However, he also quotes prominent naysayers and describes a variety of\ncounterarguments, like the idea that capitalization gives too much dignity to a category that was made up to oppress people. (Note:\nSummary of a counterargument.) Capitalizing Black raises another tricky question: Shouldn't White be likewise capitalized?\nEligon points out that the groups most enthusiastic to capitalize White seem to be white supremacists, and news organizations want\nto avoid this association. (Note: The choice of \"points out\" signals that everyone would agree that mostly white supremacist\ngroups capitalize White.)\nEligon's brief history of the debate over racial labels, from \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored\u201d to \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and \u201cperson of color,\u201d\ngives the question of to-capitalize-or-not-to-capitalize a broader context, investing what might seem like a minor quibble for editors\nwith the greater weight of racial identity and its evolution over time. (Note: This paragraph shifts focus from present to past trends\nand debates.) He outlines similar disagreements over word-choice and racial labels by scholars and activists like Fannie Barrier\nWilliams and W.E.B. Du Bois surrounding now-antiquated terms like \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored.\u201d These leaders debated whether labels\nwith negative connotations should be replaced, or embraced and given a new, positive connotation. (Note: This paragraph\nsummarizes the historical examples Eligon gives. Phrases like \"He cites\" point out that certain ideas are being used to support a\nclaim.) Eligon observes that today's \"black\" was once used as a pejorative but was promoted by the Black Power movement\nstarting in the late sixties, much as the word \"Negro\" was reclaimed as a positive word. (Note: Summary of a historical trend that\nparallels today's trend.) However, the Reverend Jesse Jackson also had some success in calling for a more neutral term, \"African\nAmerican,\" in the late eighties. He thought it more appropriate to emphasize a shared ethnic heritage over color. (Note: Summary\nof a historical countertrend based on a counterargument to the idea of reclaiming negative terms.) Eligon suggests that this\n4.11.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92728 argument continues to appeal to some today, but that such terms have been found to be inadequate given the diversity of ethnic\nheritage. \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and the more generalized \u201cpeople\/person of color\u201d do not give accurate or specific enough\ninformation. (Note: Describes a response to the counterargument, a justification of today's trend toward Black.)\nUltimately, Eligon points to personal intuition as an aid to individuals in the Black community grappling with these questions. He\ndescribes the experience of sociologist Crystal M. Fleming, whose use of lowercase \u201cblack\u201d transformed to capitalized \u201cBlack\u201d\nover the course of her career and years of research. Her transition from black to Black is, she says, as much a matter of personal\nchoice as a reasoned conclusion\u2014suggesting that it will be up to Black journalists and academics to determine the conventions of\nthe future. (Note: This last sentence of this summary paragraph focuses on Eligon's conclusion, his implied argument about what\nshould guide the choice of terms.)\nEligon's statistical and anecdotal survey of current usage of Black and black covers enough ground to convince us of the trend in\nfavor of capitalization. (Note: This sentence indicates the shift from summary to a positive assessment of the argument's\neffectiveness.) But the value of Eligon's article lies in the attention it brings both to the convention and the discussion as a way for\nthe Black community to wrestle with history and define itself. By presenting a variety of past and present opinions from Black\nleaders, Eligon gives a sense of the richness and relevance of this ongoing debate. (Note: this part of the assessment emphasizes\nnot just what is effective at convincing readers, but what is most valuable about the argument. His focus at the end on the opinion\nof one Black scholar, Crystal Fleming, offers an appealing intuitive approach to these decisions about naming. This idea is more\nhinted at than developed, leaving us to wonder how many other leaders share Fleming's approach and whether this approach might\nlead to chaos, as each writer might choose a different way to refer to racial identity.

Much of this book thus far has focused on how to summarize and evaluate other people\u2019s arguments, but those\nare only first steps. Other people\u2019s arguments help us develop our own. Writing summaries and assessments can inspire us to\ncome up with our own original points. Academic writing gives us the chance to join a worldwide conversation about what is true\non every subject under the sun.\nTo many, academic writing seems elitist. In the past, it certainly was controlled by the people in power in terms of race, ethnicity,\ngender, and wealth. It amplified the voices of the elites. But it can empower any of us. Academic writing offers ways for anyone\nwho struggles in society to find a voice.\nJust as there are many ways to respond when a friend tells us something, there are many ways to respond in writing to a written\nargument. We don\u2019t have to have all the answers; there are many ways to contribute without being experts. In this chapter, we lay\nout various options for response. By making these moves, we can help move the larger discussion toward greater insight.\nPhoto by WOCinTech Chat on Flickr, licensed CC BY 2.0.\nUses in college, work, and life\nMany college writing assignments call for responses that go beyond agreeing or disagreeing with an argument. The response can be\na place to bring in opinion and personal experience as they relate to the argument. Even if an assessment assignment doesn\u2019t\nspecifically ask for a recommendation, it often makes sense to add one to a conclusion. Whether we agreed or disagreed with the\nargument, pointing toward a next step for the larger conversation on the issue can give the essay a sense of momentum and\npurpose.\nThe response moves described in this chapter are not just for academic writing. They can also help us respond to classmates\u2019 work\nin live discussions or online comments on other people\u2019s posts. They\u2019re key in professional settings too; we often need to respond\nto an argument such as a proposal, a memo, or a case study and show that we have something to add. Social media platforms like\nTwitter, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, etc all encourage responses; we read a post and then add our own comment as we react,\nreply, share, or retweet. Of course email, texting, messageboards, forums, blogs and some news media also invite original\ncommentary. Practicing academic response writing, then, can enrich our repertoire of responses in everyday life.\n5.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/119056 Photo by Jonas Kakaroto on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nThis page titled 5.1: The Beauty of Response Writing is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nAnna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n5.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/119056 5.2: \u201cMaybe.

What is it we need to know in order to form our opinion of the argument? Does the writer need to clarify what they\nmean? Or do we need more information that could come out of research or new studies?\nCall for clarification\nIf one of the problems is vagueness or ambiguity, we probably want to call for greater clarity. We can suggest that the writer specify\nwhat they mean by a particular word or phrase. Or we may want to ask that they explain a murky point further.\nWe can call for clarification with phrases like the following:\nX should specify whether they mean _____________ or _____________.\nX should explain what they mean by _____________.\nX should elaborate on the concept of _____________.\nPhoto by Zen Chung from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nCall for additional support or study\nThe process of analyzing the argument will often lead us to see what it is that we do not know. It may expose areas of uncertainty\nor contradiction that are intriguing. If we have called into question a reason or an assumption, we may want to recommend further\nresearch or support. Perhaps we are not ready to accept something without more evidence. In that case, we might describe the kind\nof study or investigative journalism that could uncover a reason.\nIf we have thought of exceptions, then maybe the reason needs more support to show that the exceptions are not common. For\nexample, we might suggest that the writer should present some statistical evidence, like a survey, to show what the norm is, rather\nthan just a few examples. The following sample sentence summarizes and assesses an argument and then moves on to recommend\nadditional support:\nWhile Swigart is right that porous borders pose a security risk and that illegal immigration challenges the rule of law, her\nargument would have been strengthened if she had added statistics linking gang violence to human trafficking across the U.S.-\nMexico border.\n5.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/119057 We can call for support and research with phrases like the following:\nFurther research on _____________ could show us _____________.\nA study of _____________ might show whether _____________.\nIs it really the case that _____________? We need more information about _____________.\nAn investigation of _____________ could help us determine the role of _____________ in _____________.\nExercise 5.2.1\nChoose an argument about immigration that you think needs further development, such as \u201cThe Weight of the World\u201d by\nSaramanda Swigart, \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border\u201d by Anna Mills, or another of your choosing.

We can advance the conversation by qualifying or limiting the original argument. One way to do so is to state that the argument\nonly applies in a certain set of cases. Another way is to acknowledge one or more individual exceptions to it. Limiting an\nargument often helps to defend it against a counterargument.\nHere are a few phrases for suggesting limits:\nWe should recognize that this pattern is limited to cases where _____________.\nThe argument holds true in situations where _____________.\nIt is important to note that this claim only applies to _____________.\n_____________ is a notable exception because _____________.\nWe should note that this claim is certainly not true of _____________.\n\"This Is Where I Draw the Line\" by Thomas Hawk on Flickr is licensed CC BY NC 2.0.\nExercise 5.3.1\nHow would you suggest limiting each of the following arguments?

The process of assessing an argument starts us\nthinking about all the issues it brings up, and primes us to add our own two cents.\nSuggest further implications\nWe can suggest a new idea that takes the argument we assessed a step further. Can we draw an additional conclusion? Maybe we\nthink the argument's claim should lead us to action. Maybe we think that the claim could be expanded to include other cases or\nsituations.\nHere are a few ways to introduce a further implication of an argument that we agree with:\nThe idea that _____________ could apply to _____________ as well.\nBeyond _____________, X\u2019s argument has implications for _____________.\nThis argument shows how important it is that we take action on _____________.\nIf we accept the idea that _____________, as we should, then the time has come to _____________.\nGiven X\u2019s points, shouldn\u2019t we consider _____________?\nPhoto by AllGo - An App For Plus Size People on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nGive a new reason\nSometimes we may agree with an argument\u2019s claim, but for a different reason. In that case, we can make an original contribution\njust by pointing out the alternate reason. In other cases, we might just want to add one or more reasons to the list already covered\nby the argument. Maybe we are aware of evidence from another reading or from our own experience, or maybe we see a whole\ndifferent line of reasoning which also leads us to the same conclusion.\nFor example, we noted in Section 4.4 that in the argument below, the reason was the same as the claim, so the claim had no support\nat all (a fallacy called circular reasoning).\nAnyone born in the United States has a right to citizenship because citizenship here\ndepends on birth, not ethnicity or family history of immigration.\n5.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/119059 As a response to that argument, we could suggest a better reason for the same claim:\nAnyone born in the United States has a right to citizenship because the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution guarantees birthright citizenship.\nHere are a few phrases to introduce alternate or additional reasons for a claim:\nBetter evidence for _____________ lies in _____________.\nAnother reason why _____________ is that _____________.\nThe fact that _____________ provides further support for X\u2019s claim.\nMy own experience has also shown that _____________ , which leads me to agree with X.\nI have seen firsthand how _____________.\nIn addition to the evidence X gives, it is also worth considering that _____________.\n\"I love you because\" by Scarlet O. on Flickr is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.\nExplain why the argument matters\nWe can offer our own explanation for why the argument matters. This might be a point from another reading we\u2019ve done, an\nabstract idea, a personal experience, or an anecdote of someone we know. Often, explaining why the argument matters will involve\nappealing to emotion or trust, which we will look at in-depth in Chapters 8 and 9.\nHere are some phrases for underscoring the importance of an argument:\nX\u2019s claim is important because _____________.\nThis is especially concerning because _____________.\nWe should take note of this since _____________.\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nSuggest a way to spread the word\nIf we found the argument both valid and important, we are probably motivated to spread the word. Who needs to know about this\nargument, and what would be the best way to share it with them? For example, if we agree with another author that drone deliveries\nwould pose a significant threat to privacy, we might then encourage readers to write to their Congressional representatives and post\non social media about this threat.\n5.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/119059 The following phrases suggest ways to spread the word:\nWe could help spread awareness of _____________ by _____________.\nThe idea that _____________ should be taught in _____________ classes.\nWe should all talk to those we know about _____________.\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nExercise 5.4.1\nChoose an argument about immigration that you mostly agree with, such as \u201cThe Weight of the World\u201d by Saramanda\nSwigart, \u201cWouldn\u2019t We All Cross the Border\u201d by Anna Mills, or another of your choosing.

For example, let\u2019s say a\nstudent, let\u2019s call her Anoush, has just read an article that celebrates the fashion industry\u2019s inclusion of multiple ethnicities and\nbody types. Let\u2019s say Anoush is not impressed with the fashion industry\u2019s efforts. She has critiqued the article, but she knows that\nher readers may not be satisfied if she stops there. If the article was wrong, then what would a better article on the topic look like?\nWe don\u2019t always have to have a fully formed or researched argument to put our own ideas into a college essay. If our main task is\nto summarize and assess with just a little response, this part can be tentative and not fully developed. The idea is to point the reader\nin a new direction. We may want to qualify or limit our suggestion with words like \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cit may be that,\u201d or \u201cThe idea that\n_____________ is worth considering\u2026\u201d\nSuggest an alternate claim that addresses the same issue\nIf we just analyzed an argument we found to be weak, we may already have an opposing argument or an alternate argument in\nmind. If readers are convinced that the first argument is without merit, they will be looking for a replacement. Our critique puts us\nin a good position to present an alternate vision.\nIn the example above, the student Anoush could give her take on where the fashion industry is right now in terms of inclusion. She\nmight argue that the industry needs to represent a greater range of ethnicities and sizes and make sure that diverse models are\nshown as regular people, not as exotic.\nThe following phrases introduce alternate claims:\nInstead of _____________, I would argue that _____________.\nA more accurate claim would be _____________.\nIn actuality, _____________.\nThe idea that _____________ better accounts for the evidence.\nWe can find a better explanation of _____________ in _____________.\nAs we have seen, it is not true that _____________.

We can suggest a particular angle or lens. For example, we might suggest that in order to understand the scarcity of Black,\nLatino, and Asian CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, we should stop focusing so narrowly on CEOS and should look at the\ndemographics of management positions more generally since CEOs are almost always promoted from other leadership positions.\nHere are some phrases for reframing an issue:\n5.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/119060 Instead of focusing on _____________, we should look at the question in the light of _____________.\nA better way to frame the issue of _____________ would be in terms of _____________.\nTo better understand _____________, we should first ask ourselves _____________.\nPhoto by Ivan Bertolazzi from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nExercise 5.5.1\nLet's suppose we have come up with the following overall assessment of an\nargument about the pay gap between men and women: \"Chang spends too\nmuch time blaming employers for the pay gap.

(Note: The opening statement provides the\nessay's overall context: the effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic.) However, its effects will be long-lasting. (Note: The followup\nstatement introduces the essay's particular focus: the impact of the Pandemic on women.) While the Pandemic has affected\neveryone\u2019s lives in every aspect, its impacts on women are even more severe. Helen Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Coronavirus Is a\nDisaster for Feminism\u201d explains why feminism cannot survive during the Pandemic. (Note: An outside text is introduced that the\nessay will engage with.) Lewis starts her article with a complaint by saying \u201cenough already\u201d because, in terms of housework\nespecially for child care, there has been inequality since the past. This inequality has become even more explicit with the\ncoronavirus outbreak. Women have to shoulder not only more housework but also childcare more than ever due to school closures.\nThe Pandemic started as a public health crisis and brought along an economic one. Women are mainly affected by this crisis more\nthan men because women are more likely to take housework and childcare responsibilities while men are expected to work and\n\u201cbring home the bacon.\u201d (Note: The author provides a clear thesis statement to close the opening (introduction) paragraph).)\nEach gender has a different role in society. While men are usually seen as breadwinners, women mostly spend their time at home\nand do housework. (Note: The first supporting argument: the unpaid labor of women under traditional gender roles.) Women also\nare the primary caregivers for both children and elders. As Lewis mentions, \u201clooking after\u201d duty is on women\u2019s shoulder. Then she\nadds \u201c all this looking after\u2014this unpaid caring labor\u2014will fall more heavily on women because of the existing structure of the\nworkforce,\u201d and she includes a provocative question from Clare Wenham, an assistant professor of global health policy at the\nLondon School of Economics: \u201cWho is paid less? Who has the flexibility?\u201d The author intentionally uses this quote to express her\nfrustration. At the same time, she implies that this existing structure is based upon the gender pay gap. (Note: The author supports\nher argument with evidence from the text, and provides analysis to tie that evidence to her argument.) We all are familiar with the\nreality that \u201cwomen\u2019s income is less than men\u2019s\u201d so this fact goes a long way towards explaining why women mainly stay at home\nand take caregiving responsibilities. It is a kind of survival rule that whoever earns less should stay at home. In this case, it seems\nlike couples do not have many options.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the Pandemic for dual-income parents is the school and daycare closures. (Note: Whereas\nthe first support focused on gender roles, the second paragraph focuses on the particular challenges for parents during the Covid-19\nepidemic.) These dual-earner parents should find a way to split children\u2019s needs during the shelter-in-place. If they do not balance\npaid work and child care, both sides will feel the consequences. To emphasize these consequences, Lewis humorously says \u201cDual-\nincome couples might suddenly be living like their grandparents, one homemaker, and one breadwinner.\u201d (Note: Drawing on\nevidence from the text, this passage shows how gender roles relate to the challenges of Covid-19 for working parents and families.)\nInstead of splitting the housework, women take the role of \u201chomemaker\u201d so the author implies here that this regresses gender\ndynamics two generations backward. It obviously demonstrates that nothing much has changed over time and the mentality\nremains. While many couples are trying to find a middle way, others think that women have to suck it up and sacrifice their jobs.\nIn reference to school closures, Lewis brings up the Ebola health crisis which occurred in West Africa in the time period of 2014-\n2016. (Note: The following paragraph cites a historical precedent for the Covid-19 outbreak as a basis for comparison.) According\n5.7.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92732 to Lewis, during this outbreak, many African girls lost their chance at education; moreover, many women died during childbirth\nbecause of a lack of medical care. Mentioning these elaborations proves once again that not only coronavirus but also many other\noutbreaks have caused a disaster for feminism. Pandemics, in other words, pile yet another problem on women who always face an\nuphill battle against patriarchal structures. (Note: This passage ties this observation about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to a\ngreater observation about Pandemics and gender roles overall.)\nI started reading her article with a feeling of frustration. While the main topic of the article is feminism, Lewis gives a couple of\nmale examples from the past, such as William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton. (Note: The author makes a personal note here,\nmarking an emotional connection and reaction to the text.) She seems at times to attribute their success to their masculinity. They\nboth lived in times of plague, demonstrating that despite all our progress, the human species is still grappling with the same issues.\nAccording to Lewis, neither Newton nor Shakespeare had to worry about childcare or housework. Even though her comparison\nseemed odd to me, she managed to surprise me that in over 300 years many gender inequities remain the same. This is actually\nvery tragic. It is hard to acknowledge that women are still facing gender inequality in almost every area even 300 years after the\ntime of these great English thinkers. (Note: The author cites historical precedent again: this passage argues that the relationship\nbetween plagues and gender roles has not changed much in centuries.) Assuming housework is the natural place of women without\nasking women if they want to do it is asking for too big a sacrifice. Since couples have the option to split the housework and\nchildcare, why should only women have to shoulder most of the burden? This is a question that I might never be able to answer,\neven if I search my whole life. It is unacceptable that there is pressure on women to conform to gender roles, such as cultural\nsettings and expectations. (Note: The author uses a rhetorical question to segue into a new supporting argument.) Women should\nnot have to sacrifice their leisure time completing unpaid work. I agree with Lewis when she mentions the \u201csecond shift\u201d situation.\nWhen we consider women\u2019s first shift as their paid work, the second shift represents the time that they spend working in the home.\nIn this case, there is apparently no shift for leisure time. Lewis also supports this by saying \u201cAcross the world, women\u2014including\nthose with jobs\u2014do more housework and have less leisure time than their male partners.\u201d Additionally, it seems like economic\nrecovery is going to be long-lasting because of the Coronavirus. As a solution, if men and women have equal housework\nresponsibilities, women may spend more of their time completing paid work. (Note: The author makes a call to action near the end\nof the essay.) In this way, they can contribute to the economy while they are socializing. Especially after the Pandemic is over, we\nwill need a greater workforce, so hopefully both men and women can equally participate in the economy. (Note: Much like the first\nsentence of the essay, the last sentence speaks to a greater, big-picture context: the need for equality in a post-pandemic world.)\nAttribution\nThis sample essay was written by Gizem Gur and edited by Anna Mills.

(Note:\nThe opening sentence introduces the text this essay will respond to and gives a brief summary of the text's content.) Eligon argues\nthat, while it might seem like a minor typographical issue, this small difference speaks to the question of how we think about\nrace in the United States. Are words like \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d mere adjectives, descriptors of skin color? Or are they proper nouns,\nindicative of group or ethnic identity? Eligon observes that until recently, with the prominence of the Black Lives Matter\nmovement, many journalistic and scholarly publications tended to use a lowercase \u201cblack,\u201d while Black media outlets typically\ncapitalized \u201cBlack.\u201d He suggests that the balance is now tipping in favor of \"Black,\" but given past changes, usage will probably\nchange again as the rich discussion about naming, identity, and power continues. (Note: The thesis statement includes two related\nideas explored by Eligon: the current trend toward using \"Black\" and the value of the ongoing discussion that leads to changing\nterms.)\nEligon points to a range of evidence that \"Black\" is becoming the norm, including a recent change by \"hundreds of news\norganizations\" including the Associated Press. This comes in the wake of the George Floyd killing, but it also follows a longtime\nBlack press tradition exemplified by newspapers like The New York Amsterdam News. Eligon cites several prominent academics\nwho are also starting to capitalize Black. However, he also quotes prominent naysayers and describes a variety of\ncounterarguments, like the idea that capitalization gives too much dignity to a category that was made up to oppress people. (Note:\nSummary of a counterargument.) Capitalizing Black raises another tricky question: Shouldn't White be likewise capitalized?\nEligon points out that the groups most enthusiastic to capitalize White seem to be white supremacists, and news organizations want\nto avoid this association. (Note: The choice of \"points out\" signals that everyone would agree that mostly white supremacist\ngroups capitalize White.)\nEligon's brief history of the debate over racial labels, from \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored\u201d to \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and \u201cperson of color,\u201d\ngives the question of to-capitalize-or-not-to-capitalize a broader context, investing what might seem like a minor quibble for editors\nwith the greater weight of racial identity and its evolution over time. (Note: This paragraph shifts focus from present to past trends\nand debates.) He outlines similar disagreements over word-choice and racial labels by scholars and activists like Fannie Barrier\nWilliams and W.E.B. Du Bois surrounding now-antiquated terms like \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored.\u201d These leaders debated whether labels\nwith negative connotations should be replaced, or embraced and given a new, positive connotation. (Note: This paragraph\nsummarizes the historical examples Eligon gives. Phrases like \"He cites\" point out that certain ideas are being used to support a\nclaim.) Eligon observes that today's \"black\" was once used as a pejorative but was promoted by the Black Power movement\nstarting in the late sixties, much as the word \"Negro\" was reclaimed as a positive word. (Note: Summary of a historical trend that\nparallels today's trend.) However, the Reverend Jesse Jackson also had some success in calling for a more neutral term, \"African\nAmerican,\" in the late eighties. He thought it more appropriate to emphasize a shared ethnic heritage over color. (Note: Summary\nof a historical countertrend based on a counterargument to the idea of reclaiming negative terms.) Eligon suggests that this\n5.7.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92731 argument continues to appeal to some today, but that such terms have been found to be inadequate given the diversity of ethnic\nheritage. \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and the more generalized \u201cpeople\/person of color\u201d do not give accurate or specific enough\ninformation. (Note: Describes a response to the counterargument, a justification of today's trend toward Black.)\nUltimately, Eligon points to personal intuition as an aid to individuals in the Black community grappling with these questions. He\ndescribes the experience of sociologist Crystal M. Fleming, whose use of lowercase \u201cblack\u201d transformed to capitalized \u201cBlack\u201d\nover the course of her career and years of research. Her transition from black to Black is, she says, as much a matter of personal\nchoice as a reasoned conclusion\u2014suggesting that it will be up to Black journalists and academics to determine the conventions of\nthe future. (Note: This last sentence of this summary paragraph focuses on Eligon's conclusion, his implied argument about what\nshould guide the choice of terms.)\nEligon's statistical and anecdotal survey of current usage of Black and black covers enough ground to convince us of the trend in\nfavor of capitalization. (Note: This sentence indicates the shift from summary to a positive assessment of the argument's\neffectiveness.) But the value of Eligon's article lies in the attention it brings both to the convention and the discussion as a way for\nthe Black community to wrestle with history and define itself. By presenting a variety of past and present opinions from Black\nleaders, Eligon gives a sense of the richness and relevance of this ongoing debate. (Note: this part of the assessment emphasizes\nnot just what is effective at convincing readers, but what is most valuable about the argument.) His focus at the end on the opinion\nof one Black scholar, Crystal Fleming, offers an appealing intuitive approach to these decisions about naming. This idea is more\nhinted at than developed, leaving us to wonder how many other leaders share Fleming's approach and whether this approach might\nlead to chaos, as each writer might choose a different way to refer to racial identity. (Note: This last sentence offers a gentle\ncritique of the limits of Eligon's evidence on this last point and the existence of possible counterarguments that are not\naddressed.) Still, Eligon's ending leaves us hopeful about the positive outcome of continuing the discussion: perhaps decisions\nabout naming can help the Black community find self-definition in the face of historical injustice.\nWe could build on Eligon's analysis to make a further claim about success not just of Black but of other terms that remind us of a\nshared history of oppression. Despite the ongoing debates, his evidence suggests that the Black community has gravitated more\ntoward reclaiming negative terms rather than inventing neutral ones. (Note: The writer suggests a way to draw a new\nconclusion using Eligon's evidence.) He notes that historically, W.E.B Dubois's push to embrace Negro and transform it into a\npositive was successful and that the Black Power movement did the same with black. It is true that the term African American has\nbeen partially successful, but clearly its relevance is waning: Eligon scarcely considers it necessary to mention this term further as\nhe turns to the discussion of black vs. Black. The Black Lives Matter movement chose Black rather than African American, and\nthis choice continued to feel appropriate when the movement grew dramatically after the killing of George Floyd. (Note: The writer\npoints to ideas that were implied but not emphasized by Eligon.)\nWhy has the Black community continued to gravitate toward previously negative terms? Perhaps in this time of racial reckoning, in\nthe face of active ongoing injustice, a label that points to the history of oppression is more empowering. It expresses defiance and\ndetermination. If so, perhaps it would make sense for The New York Times to adopt Black. Eligon does not take a side on this issue,\nperhaps because he is not writing an opinion piece, but it is a short distance from his piece to a piece advocating that the Times\nfollow the lead of the Associated Press and the majority of Black leaders of the moment. (Note: Here, the response claims that a\nparticular stance on a controversial issue follows from Eligon's argument.) Howard Zinn, radical author of A People's History of\nthe United States, writes, \u201cThe memory of oppressed people is one thing that cannot be taken away, and for such people, with such\nmemories, revolt is always an inch below the surface.\u201d Reclaiming an oppressor's name for a people keeps this memory, and this\npotential for revolt, alive. Ideally, each time we use such a reclaimed term, we remember that inequity still permeates our society,\nand we recommit ourselves to fighting its many forms. (Note: The essay suggests a way in which this discussion of terms for an\noppressed community can inspire us to fight oppression more broadly.)\nEligon focuses only on the Black community in America, but it would be interesting to learn more about the appeal of reclaiming\nnegative terms by looking at trends among other marginalized groups. (Note: This passage adds to the conversation by suggesting\nparallels to groups beyond the Black community.) Which ones have chosen to embrace once-hateful terms, and which have\nchosen new, more accurate, more inclusive names? Does reclaiming negative terms become more common when oppression is\nmore active? One obvious example lies in the reclaiming of the term \"queer.\" Despite ongoing marginalization of queer people, the\nreclaimed term never gained dominance. \"LGBTQ\" and variations are used more commonly, despite their awkwardness. Another\nparallel lies in the debate over the use of Indian vs. Native American vs. indigenous. The term \"cholo,\" too, was initially a slur\nreferring to persons of mixed Amerindian ancestry in Bolivia and Peru, but is now used by some as a badge of indigenous pride and\npower. (It has various other meanings in Mexico, the United States, and in other Latin American countries.) Future discussions\n5.7.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92731 could analyze the historical trends in terminology and their relation to changing power relations for each of these groups. Perhaps\ncomparing these histories could shed new light on the complex role of names in the struggle for social justice.\nWorks Cited\n(Note: Works Cited page uses MLA documentation style appropriate for an English class)\nEligon, John. \u201cA Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans \u2018Black\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019?\u201d The New York Times, 26 Jun\n2020. https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/26\/u...merican-style-debate.html?\naction=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage\nAttributions\nThis sample essay and its annotations were written by Saramanda Swigart and edited by Anna Mills.

Why is the research paper the focus of most writing courses?\nIt\u2019s really not because instructors are sadists. Quite the contrary! The process of writing a research paper can help us learn about a\ncomplex topic and come up with our own informed perspective. It\u2019s a way to find clarity when the world is complicated. We\nimmerse ourselves in others' ideas and then come to our own conclusion.\nWe might consider that in writing a research paper we are fully joining the academic conversation. As Gerald Graff and Cathy\nBirkenstein put it in They Say \/ I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing, the research paper is \u201cthe highest expression of\nthe conversational approach to writing...it is a chance to practice a set of skills that you can use the rest of your life: going out into\nthe community, finding a space for yourself, and making a contribution of your own\u201d (219).\nA research paper brings together many voices on a topic. Image by Marc Wathiew on Flickr, licensed CC BY NC 2.0.\nEarlier chapters of this book have focused on responding to other people\u2019s arguments. Summary, assessment, and response essays\nand compare-and-contrast essays require us to write about the things someone else considers important. As we start the research\npaper, we can enjoy a bit more freedom. We can find multiple perspectives on the same topic and decide how much of each to\ninclude.\nMany students, after some initial anxiety, ultimately find the research paper to be empowering and meaningful. Here are a\nfew reasons to celebrate this kind of assignment:\nWe become relative experts on one micro subject.\nWe build our own argument and choose our focus.\nWe are free to choose a variety of sources; we don't have to use what a teacher selects.\nWe don\u2019t have to cover everything. We have flexibility about which ideas to include and how to narrow our topic.\nWe can choose a personally meaningful topic that connects to an area of interest, experience, or career plans.\nWe get to teach the teacher and our classmates something they may enjoy learning.\nWe build on existing skills for responding to sources\nThus far we have focused on skills for close reading and summary of one text (Chapters 2 and Chapter 3), assessment of that\ntext (Chapter 4), and then original responses to the text (Chapter 5). All these skills will be useful as we work with multiple texts\nin the research paper, but we won\u2019t need to be as thorough with each source. We\u2019ll focus more on summarizing, assessing, and\nresponding to main ideas rather than examining all the twists and turns of each argument.\n6.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/122848 Which new skills do we need? Since we are going to be finding our own sources, we need to know where to look. We need to\nknow which sources are credible. Since there are many kinds of sources, from academic studies to newspaper articles, to\ninterviews, videos, and social media posts, we need to see which kinds of sources can be useful for which purposes. The rest of this\nchapter will give guidance on choosing sources.\nIn essays that focus on summary, assessment, and response, the structure is to a large extent determined by the text we are\nresponding to. With the research paper, we have a lot more freedom, so we may need new organizational strategies. How do we\ncome up with a central idea for our paper that builds on a bunch of different sources? Conversely, how do we mention multiple\nsources in different paragraphs and use them to support a central idea? Chapter 7 sections on definition, evaluation, causal, and\nproposal arguments will offer ideas for organization based on the argument's purpose.\nThis page titled 6.1: The Ultimate Tool for Thinking and Sharing Our Thoughts is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored,\nremixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n6.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/122848 6.2: Approaching a Research Paper Assignment\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (1 min, 51 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 11::5511\nBefore getting started on a research paper, spending some time with the prompt will help keep us from becoming overwhelmed. A\nresearch essay prompt is the instructor's description of the assignment. It will answer many of the questions we may have about the\nrequirements, such as the following:\n1. How many sources will we need?\n2. What types of sources (see Section 6.5: Types of Sources)?\n3. Do the sources need to be found somewhere specific, like the college library?\n4. How long does the research essay need to be?\n5. Is there a specific structure we are supposed to follow?\nPhoto by Liza Summer on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nThe steps below will help us analyze the essay prompt to get a clear picture of what the finished paper should include.\nFirst, circle or highlight all of the most important verbs in the prompt. Verbs are action words that often communicate the most\nimportant tasks in the assignment, like analyze, evaluate, describe, and so on.\nThen, create a chart that lists each verb in its own row on the left and the rest of the sentence it occurs in on the right. This will\ncontain the most important components of the assignment, so you can use it later to review your draft.\nIs one of these writing tasks more the focus of the essay than the others? For example, an assignment might ask you to\nsummarize a problem but spend more of the essay describing a proposed solution. In that case, you could put a star next to the\ntask of describing the solution.\nUnderline or highlight any words or requirements you don\u2019t understand, and ask your professor to clarify.\nSummarize the research essay prompt aloud by telling a friend or classmate what your assignment is about and what the basic\nrequirements are.\nChapter 6 will describe what authoritative sources are, where to find them, and how to choose them. However, you can find your\ninstructor's specific approach in the assignment description, so keep their instructions in mind as you read other advice on the\nresearch process.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence by Amy Guptill, published by Open SUNY\nTextbooks, licensed CC BY NC SA 4.0.\n6.2: Approaching a Research Paper Assignment is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nLibreTexts.\n6.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29509 6.3: Choosing a Focused Topic\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 46 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::4466\nChoosing a Focused Topic\nWe can start with any general area of interest within the guidelines of the research essay prompt. See Section 11.3: Brainstorming\non ways to come up with ideas. In most cases, as we research we will want to narrow our topic from this general beginning in order\nto be able to really dive into the conversation on the topic and consider multiple perspectives and counterarguments. We will likely\nlearn about many subtopics as we explore our initial topic. If we read an overview of the initial topic, we can often identify\nsubtopics by the way that overview is organized into sections. Though Wikipedia is not a scholarly source, it can be very helpful\nfor this phase of the research process. Along the way, we can decide which we are interested in, research some more, and possibly\nnarrow the topic yet further \u2014 all before attempting a rough draft.\nJust as this map highlights one province within a country, a good research paper often focused on a limited aspect of a larger topic.\nImage by timacs on Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nLet\u2019s take the example of solar energy as a general area of interest. As we research solar energy, we will see that there are different\nways of harnessing the energy--from the sun\u2019s light and from the sun\u2019s heat. These correspond to the subtopics of solar\nphotovoltaic energy and solar thermal energy. Say may decide we are more interested in solar thermal energy. We research that\ntopic further and find that the sun\u2019s heat can be used to heat water in buildings or to heat the ventilation system, but they can also\nbe used to generate electricity in large solar thermal power plants using a technique called Concentrated Solar Power, or CSP. Let\u2019s\nsay that last use intrigues us. However, as we start to read the technical details of how these power plants work, we realize we are\nmore interested in the potential of these plants than in their engineering. We are excited to read about the largest existing solar\nthermal power plant, the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the Mojave Desert of California, and we wonder how that facility can\nserve as a model for others. So the sequence of topics as we narrow it down goes like this:\n1. Solar energy\n2. Solar thermal energy\n3. The Concentrated Solar Power technique for using solar thermal power to generate electricity\n4. The potential renewable energy contribution of Concentrated Solar Power thermal energy plants\n5. Ivanpah Solar Power Facility as a model for renewable electricity through large-scale Concentrated Solar Power thermal energy\nplants\nIf you are finding it hard to be specific about a topic, take a break from defining it and keep researching and brainstorming.\n6.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/122955 Photo by Anna Alexes from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nDeveloping a research question\nKnowing what question we are trying to answer can help us research efficiently. Before we start, we can use our focused topic to\narticulate a research question.\nIf we already have a guess as to what our answer is likely to be, we may want to articulate that as well in what is sometimes called\na working thesis. We can come up with a hypothesis that we will test against the information you find in sources as we research.\nKeep in mind, we may want to modify the question and the hypothesis as we learn more.\nA good research question will be challenging or potentially arguable. It will suggest the need for further investigation. Here are\nthree possible research questions related to the topic above:\nShould we build more large-scale Concentrated Solar Power thermal energy plants like the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility?\nWhat are the environmental and social benefits of a large-scale Concentrated Solar Power thermal energy plant like the Ivanpah\nSolar Power Facility?\nUnder what circumstances will large-scale Concentrated Solar Power thermal energy plants like the Ivanpah Solar Power\nFacility be cost-effective choices for clean energy?\nAs we research, we can revisit our research question from time to time to see if we are on track to answer it or if we need to change\nthe question or the research.\nPractice exercise 6.3.1\nWrite a phrase to describe a general area of interest you would like to investigate. Then do some preliminary online research\nusing Wikipedia to identify subtopics. Choose one subtopic, do some research on it, and identify an even narrower subtopic.\nCreate a list of at least three increasingly specific topics. Use the list above that started with solar energy as your model.\nAttributions\nWritten by Natalie Peterkin and Anna Mills and licensed CC BY NC 4.0.\n6.3: Choosing a Focused Topic is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n6.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/122955 6.4: Find the Conversation That Interests You\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (8 min, 52 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 88::5522\nBefore we start talking about how to choose search terms and where to search for sources, it can help to get a sense of what we\u2019re\nhoping to get out of the research. We might think that in order to support a thesis we should only look for sources that prove an idea\nwe want to promote. But since writing academic papers is about joining a conversation, what we really need is to gather the sources\nthat will help us situate our ideas within that ongoing conversation. What we should look for first is not support but the\nconversation itself: who is saying what about our topic?\nThe sources that make up the conversation may have various kinds of points to make and ultimately may play very different roles\nin our paper. After all, as we have seen in Chapter 2, an argument can involve not just evidence for a claim but limits,\ncounterarguments, and rebuttals. Sometimes we will want to cite a research finding that provides strong evidence for a point; at\nother times, we will summarize someone else\u2019s ideas in order to explain how our own opinion differs or to note how someone\nelse\u2019s concept applies to a new situation.\nAs you find sources on a topic, look for points of connection, similarity and difference between them. In your paper, you will need\nto show not just what each one says, but how they relate to each other in a conversation. Describing this conversation can be the\nspringboard for your own original point.\nPhoto by Fabio Bracht on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nHere are five common ways research papers can build on multiple sources to come up with an original point:\n1. Combine research findings from multiple sources to make a larger summary argument. You might find that none of the\nsources you\u2019re working with specifically claim that early 20th-century British literature was preoccupied with changing gender\nroles but that, together, their findings all point to that broader conclusion.\n2. Combine research findings from multiple sources to make a claim about their implications. You might review papers that\nexplore various factors shaping voting behavior to argue that a particular voting-reform proposal will likely have positive\nimpacts.\n3. Identify underlying areas of agreement. You may argue that the literature on cancer and the literature on violence both\ndescribe the unrecognized importance of prevention and early intervention. This similarity will support your claim that insights\n6.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29517 about one set of problems may be useful for the other.\n4. Identify underlying areas of disagreement. You may find that the controversies surrounding educational reform\u2014and its\ndebates about accountability, curricula, school funding\u2014ultimately stem from different assumptions about the role of schools in\nsociety.\n5. Identify unanswered questions. Perhaps you review studies of the genetic and behavioral contributors to diabetes in order to\nhighlight unknown factors and argue for more in-depth research on the role of the environment.\nThere are certainly other ways authors use sources to build theses, but these examples illustrate how original thinking in academic\nwriting involves making connections with and between a strategically chosen set of sources.\nHere\u2019s a passage of academic writing (an excerpt, not a complete paper) that gives an example of how a writer can describe a\nconversation among sources and use it to make an original point:\nWillingham (2011) draws on cognitive science to explain that students must be able to\nregulate their emotions in order to learn. Emotional self-regulation enables students to\nignore distractions and channel their attention and behaviors in appropriate ways. Other\nresearch findings confirm that anxiety interferes with learning and academic performance\nbecause it makes distractions harder to resist (Perkins and Graham-Bermann, 2012;\nPutwain and Best, 2011). Other cognitive scientists point out that deep learning is itself\nstressful because it requires people to think hard about complex, unfamiliar material\ninstead of relying on cognitive short-cuts.\nKahneman (2011) describes this difference in terms of two systems for thinking: one fast\nand one slow. Fast thinking is based on assumptions and habits and doesn\u2019t require a lot\nof effort. For example, driving a familiar route or a routine grocery-shopping trip are not\nusually intellectually taxing activities. Slow thinking, on the other hand, is what we do\nwhen we encounter novel problems and situations. It\u2019s effortful, and it usually feels\ntedious and confusing. It is emotionally challenging as well because we are, by definition,\nincompetent while we\u2019re doing it, which provokes some anxiety. Solving a tough problem\nis rewarding, but the path itself is often unpleasant.\nThese insights from cognitive science enable us to critically assess the claims made on\nboth sides of the education reform debate. On one hand, they cast doubt on the claims of\neducation reformers that measuring teachers\u2019 performance by student test scores is the\nbest way to improve education. For example, the Center for Education Reform promotes\n\u201cthe implementation of strong, data-driven, performance-based accountability systems\nthat ensure teachers are rewarded, retained and advanced based on how they perform in\nadding value to the students who they teach, measured predominantly by student\nachievement.\" The research that Willingham (2011) and Kahneman (2011) describe\nsuggests that frequent high-stakes testing may actually work against learning by\nintroducing greater anxiety into the school environment.\nAt the same time, opponents of education reform should acknowledge that these research\nfindings should prompt us to take a fresh look at how we educate our children. While Stan\nKarp of Rethinking Schools is correct when he argues that \u201cdata-driven formulas [based\non standardized testing] lack both statistical credibility and a basic understanding of the\nhuman motivations and relationships that make good schooling possible,\" it doesn\u2019t\n6.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29517 necessarily follow that all education reform proposals lack merit. Challenging standards,\ntogether with specific training in emotional self-regulation, will likely enable more\nstudents to succeed.\nIn that example, the ideas of Willingham and Kahneman are summarized approvingly, bolstered with additional research findings,\nand then applied to a new realm: the current debate surrounding education reform. Voices in that debate were portrayed as\naccurately as possible, sometimes with representative quotes. Most importantly, all references were tied directly to the author\u2019s own\ninterpretative point, which relies on the source\u2019s claims.\nAs you can see, there are times when you should quote or paraphrase sources that you don\u2019t agree with or do not find particularly\ncompelling. They may convey ideas and opinions that help explain and justify your own argument. Whether or not we agree with a\nsource, we can focus on what it claims and how exactly its claims relate to other sources and to our own ideas.\n1Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, They Say\/I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing, (New York: W.W.

Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often considered illegitimate? And what are good sources\nto use? The table below summarizes types of secondary sources in four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier\nones are preferable for citation.\nJust as different fruits have different internal structures, different kinds of sources have different characteristics and uses.\nPhoto by Deon Black on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nTypes of Sources\nTier Type Content Uses How to find them\nProvide strong evidence\nGoogle Scholar, library\nPeer-reviewed academic Rigorous research and for claims and references\n1 catalogs, and academic\npublications analysis to other high-quality\narticle databases\nsources\nInitial research on events Websites of relevant\nReports, articles, and Well researched and even- or trends not yet analyzed agencies, Google searches\n2 books from credible non- handed descriptions of an in the academic literature; using (site: *.gov or site:\nacademic sources event or state of the world may reference important *.org), academic article\nTier 1 sources databases\nOften point to useful Tier 2 Strategic Google searches\nShort pieces from Simple reporting of events,\nor Tier 1 sources, may or article databases\n3 newspapers or credible research findings, or\nprovide a factoid or two including newspapers and\nwebsites policy changes\nnot found anywhere else magazines\nMay represent a particular\nMostly opinion, varying in position within a debate;\nAgenda-driven or Non-specific Google\n4 thoughtfulness and more often provide\nuncertain pieces searches\ncredibility keywords and clues about\nhigher quality sources\n6.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29510 Tier 1: Peer-reviewed academic publications\nThese are sources from the mainstream academic literature: books and scholarly articles. Academic books generally fall into three\ncategories: (1) textbooks written with students in mind, (2) monographs which give an extended report on a large research project,\nand (3) edited volumes in which each chapter is authored by different people. Scholarly articles appear in academic journals, which\nare published multiple times a year in order to share the latest research findings with scholars in the field. They\u2019re usually\nsponsored by some academic society. To get published, these articles and books had to earn favorable anonymous evaluations by\nqualified scholars. Who are the experts writing, reviewing, and editing these scholarly publications? Your professors. I describe this\nprocess below. Learning how to read and use these sources is a fundamental part of being a college student.\nTier 2: Reports, articles, and books from credible non-academic sources\nSome events and trends are too recent to appear in Tier 1 sources. Also, Tier 1 sources tend to be highly specific, and sometimes\nyou need a more general perspective on a topic. Thus, Tier 2 sources can provide quality information that is more accessible to\nnon-academics. There are three main categories. First, official reports from government agencies or major international institutions\nlike the World Bank or the United Nations; these institutions generally have research departments staffed with qualified experts\nwho seek to provide rigorous, even-handed information to decision-makers. Second, feature articles from major newspapers and\nmagazines like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The London Times, or The Economist are based on original reporting\nby experienced journalists (not press releases) and are typically 1500+ words in length. Third, there are some great books from\nnon-academic presses that cite their sources; they\u2019re often written by journalists. All three of these sources are generally well-\nresearched descriptions of an event or state of the world, undertaken by credentialed experts who generally seek to be even-handed.\nIt is still up to you to judge their credibility. Your instructors and campus librarians can advise you on which sources in this\ncategory have the most credibility.\nTier 3. Short pieces from periodicals or credible websites\nA step below the well-developed reports and feature articles that make up Tier 2 are the short tidbits that one finds in newspapers\nand magazines or credible websites. How short is a short news article? Usually, they\u2019re just a couple paragraphs or less, and they\u2019re\noften reporting on just one thing: an event, an interesting research finding, or a policy change. They don\u2019t take extensive research\nand analysis to write, and many just summarize a press release written and distributed by an organization or business. They may\ndescribe things like corporate mergers, newly discovered diet-health links, or important school-funding legislation. You may want\nto cite Tier 3 sources in your paper if they provide an important factoid or two that isn\u2019t provided by a higher-tier piece, but if the\nTier 3 article describes a particular study or academic expert, your best bet is to find the journal article or book it is reporting on\nand use that Tier 1 source instead. If the article mentions which journal the study was published in, you can go right to that journal\nthrough your library website. Sometimes you can find the original journal article by putting the scholar\u2019s name and some keywords\ninto Google Scholar.\nWhat counts as a credible website in this tier? You may need some guidance from instructors or librarians, but you can learn a lot\nby examining the person or organization providing the information (look for an \u201cAbout\u201d link). For example, if the organization is\nclearly agenda-driven or not up-front about its aims and\/or funding sources, then it definitely isn\u2019t something you want to cite as a\nneutral authority. Also look for signs of expertise. A tidbit about a medical research finding written by someone with a science\nbackground carries more weight than the same topic written by a policy analyst. These sources are sometimes uncertain, which is\nall the more reason to follow the trail to a Tier 1 or Tier 2 source whenever possible.\nTier 4. Agenda-driven or pieces from unknown sources\nThis tier is essentially everything else, including Wikipedia.4 These types of sources\u2014especially Wikipedia\u2014can be hugely helpful\nin identifying interesting topics, positions within a debate, keywords to search on, and, sometimes, higher-tier sources on the topic.\nThey often play a critically important role in the early part of the research process, but they generally aren\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t be) cited\nin the final paper. Throwing some keywords into Google and seeing what you get is a fine way to get started, but don\u2019t stop there.\nStart a list of the people, organizations, sources, and keywords that seem most relevant to your topic. For example, suppose you\u2019ve\nbeen assigned a research paper about the impact of linen production and trade on the ancient world. A quick Google search reveals\nthat (1) linen comes from the flax plant, (2) the scientific name for flax is Linum usitatissimum, (3) Egypt dominated linen\nproduction at the height of its empire, and (4) Alex J. Warden published a book about ancient linen trade in 1867. Similarly, you\nfound some useful search terms to try instead of \u201cancient world\u201d (antiquity, Egyptian empire, ancient Egypt, ancient\n6.5.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29510 Mediterranean) and some generalizations for linen (fabric, textiles, or weaving). Now you\u2019ve got a lot to work with as you tap into\nthe library catalog and academic article databases.\nPractice Exercise 6.5.1\nChoose a topic that interests you and find one source related to it in each of the four tiers. What could you learn from each\nsource? What are the limitations of each source?\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence by Amy Guptill, published by Open SUNY\nTextbooks, licensed CC BY NC SA 4.0.\n6.5: Types of Sources is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n6.5.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29510 6.6: Getting Familiar with Academic Journal Articles\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (8 min, 2 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 88::0022\nMost of the Tier 1 sources available are academic articles, also called scholarly articles, scholarly papers, journal articles, academic\npapers, or peer-reviewed articles. They all mean the same thing: a paper published in an academic periodical after being scrutinized\nanonymously and judged to be sound by other experts in the subfield. Their origin explains both their basic structure and the high\nesteem they have in the eyes of your professors.\nMany journals are sponsored by academic associations. Most of your professors belong to some big, general one (such as the\nModern Language Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association for Sport and Physical\nEducation, or the American Physical Society) and one or more smaller ones organized around particular areas of interest and\nexpertise (such as the Association for the Study of Food and Society, the International Association for Statistical Computing, or the\nSlavic and East European Folklore Association). There are also generalist organizations organized by region of the country or state,\nsuch as the Eastern Sociological Society or the Southern Management Association. Each of these associations exists to promote the\nexchange of research findings and collaboration in their disciplines. Towards this end, they organize conferences, sponsor working\ngroups, and publish one or more academic journals. These journals are meant to both publicize and archive the most interesting and\nimportant findings of the field.\nPhoto by justgrimes on Flickr, licensed CC BY-SA 2.0.\nAcademic papers are essentially reports that scholars write to their peers\u2014present and future\u2014about what they\u2019ve done in their\nresearch, what they\u2019ve found, and why they think it\u2019s important. Thus, in a lot of fields they often have a structure reminiscent of\nthe lab reports you\u2019ve written for science classes:\n1. Abstract: A one-paragraph summary of the article: its purpose, methods, findings, and significance.\n2. Introduction: An overview of the key question or problem that the paper addresses, why it is important, and the key\nconclusion(s) (i.e., thesis or theses) of the paper.\n3. Literature review: A synthesis of all the relevant prior research (the so-called \u201cacademic literature\u201d on the subject) that\nexplains why the paper makes an original and important contribution to the body of knowledge.\n4. Data and methods: An explanation of what data or information the author(s) used and what they did with it.\n5. Results: A full explanation of the key findings of the study.\n6. Conclusion\/discussion: Puts the key findings or insights from the paper into their broader context; explains why they matter.\n6.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29511 Not all papers are so \u201csciencey.\u201d For example, a historical or literary analysis doesn\u2019t necessarily have a \u201cdata and methods\u201d\nsection; but they do explain and justify the research question, describe how the authors\u2019 own points relate to those made in other\nrelevant articles and books, develop the key insights yielded by the analysis, and conclude by explaining their significance. Some\nacademic papers are review articles, in which the \u201cdata\u201d are published papers and the \u201cfindings\u201d are key insights, enduring lines of\ndebate, and\/or remaining unanswered questions.\nScholarly journals use a peer-review process to decide which articles merit publication. First, hopeful authors send their article\nmanuscript to the journal editor, a role filled by some prominent scholar in the field. The editor reads over the manuscript and\ndecides whether it seems worthy of peer review. If it\u2019s outside the interests of the journal or is clearly inadequate, the editor will\nreject it outright. If it looks appropriate and sufficiently high quality, the editor will recruit a few other experts in the field to act as\nanonymous peer reviewers. The editor will send the manuscript (scrubbed of identifying information) to the reviewers who will\nread it closely and provide a thorough critique. Is the research question driving the paper timely and important? Does the paper\nsufficiently and accurately review all of the relevant prior research? Are the information sources believable and the research\nmethods rigorous? Are the stated results fully justified by the findings? Is the significance of the research clear? Is it well written?\nOverall, does the paper add new, trustworthy, and important knowledge to the field? Reviewers send their comments to the editor\nwho then decides whether to (1) reject the manuscript, (2) ask the author(s) to revise and resubmit the manuscript, or (3) accept it\nfor publication. Editors send the reviewers\u2019 comments (again, with no identifying information) to authors along with their\ndecisions. A manuscript that has been revised and resubmitted usually goes out for peer-review again; editors often try to get\nreviews from one or two first-round reviewers as well as a new reviewer. The whole process, from start to finish, can easily take a\nyear, and it is often another year before the paper appears in print.\nHighlighting is just one strategy for reading academic journal articles strategically.\nPhoto by Mitchell Luo on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nUnderstanding the academic publication process and the structure of scholarly articles tells you a lot about how to find, read and\nuse these sources:\n1. Find them quickly. Instead of paging through mountains of dubious web content, go right to the relevant scholarly article\ndatabases in order to quickly find the highest quality sources.\n2. Use the abstracts. Abstracts tell you immediately whether or not the article you\u2019re holding is relevant or useful to the paper\nyou\u2019re assigned to write. You shouldn\u2019t ever have the experience of reading the whole paper just to discover it\u2019s not useful.\n3. Read strategically. Knowing the anatomy of a scholarly article tells you what you should be reading for in each section. For\nexample, you don\u2019t necessarily need to understand every nuance of the literature review. You can just focus on why the authors\nclaim that their own study is distinct from the ones that came before.\n4. Don\u2019t sweat the technical stuff. Not every social scientist understands the intricacies of log-linear modeling of quantitative\nsurvey data; however, the reviewers definitely do, and they found the analysis to be well constructed. Thus, you can accept the\nfindings as legitimate and just focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language.\n5. Use one article to find others. If you have one really good article that\u2019s a few years old, you can use article databases to find\nnewer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer\nnewer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is very recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers\nin the same line of research. You can look them up directly.\nStudents sometimes grumble when they\u2019re ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google\nsome terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts\nand structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages.\n6.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29511 Practice Exercise 6.6.1\nEnter a topic into a general subscription database that has both scholarly and non-scholarly sources (such as Academic Search\nComplete or Academic OneFile); browse the first few hits and classify each one as scholarly or not-scholarly.

Some are general-purpose databases that include\nthe most prominent journals across disciplines, such as Academic Search Premier (by EBSCO), Academic Search Complete (by\nEBSCO), Academic OneFile (by Cengage), General OneFile (by Cengage), ArticleFirst (by OCLC), and JSTOR (by ITHAKA).\nSome are specific to a particular discipline, such as PsycINFO (for psychology), CINAHL (for nursing), Environment Complete\n(for environmental science), Historical Abstracts (for history). Often they have the full-text of the articles right there for you to save\nor print. We won\u2019t go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings. If you haven\u2019t already attended a\nworkshop on using the resources provided by your library, you should. A one-hour workshop will save you many, many hours in\nthe future. If there aren\u2019t any workshops, you can always seek advice from librarians and other library staff on the best databases\nfor your topic. Many libraries also have online research guides that point you to the best databases for the specific discipline and,\nperhaps, the specific course. Librarians are eager to help you succeed with your research\u2014it\u2019s their job and they love it!\u2014so don\u2019t\nbe shy about asking.\nAn increasingly popular article database is Google Scholar. It looks like a regular Google search, and it aspires to include the vast\nmajority of published scholarship. Google doesn\u2019t share a list of which journals they include or how Google Scholar works, which\nlimits its utility for scholars. Also, because it\u2019s so wide-ranging, it can be harder to find the most appropriate sources. However, if\nyou want to cast a wide net, it\u2019s a very useful tool.\nHere are three tips for using Google Scholar effectively:\n1. Add your field (economics, psychology, French, etc.) as one of your keywords.\nIf you just put in \u201ccrime,\u201d for example, Google Scholar will return all sorts of stuff from sociology, psychology, geography, and\nhistory. If your paper is on crime in French literature, your best sources may be buried under thousands of papers from other\ndisciplines. A set of search terms like \u201ccrime French literature modern\u201d will get you to relevant sources much faster.\n2. Don\u2019t ever pay for an article.\nWhen you click on links to articles in Google Scholar, you may end up on a publisher\u2019s site that tells you that you can download\nthe article for $20 or $30. Don\u2019t do it! You probably have access to virtually all the published academic literature through your\nlibrary resources. Write down the key information (authors\u2019 names, title, journal title, volume, issue number, year, page\nnumbers) and go find the article through your library website. If you don\u2019t have immediate full-text access, you may be able to\nget it through inter-library loan.\n3. Use the \u201ccited by\u201d feature.\nIf you get one great hit on Google Scholar, you can quickly see a list of other papers that cited it. For example, the search terms\n\u201ccrime economics\u201d yielded this hit for a 1988 paper that appeared in a journal called Kyklos:\nText description of Google Scholar results image\n6.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29512 1988 is nearly 30 years ago; for a social-science paper you probably want more recent sources. You can see that, according to\nGoogle, this paper was cited by 392 other sources. You can click on that \u201cCited by 392\u201d to see that list. You can even search within\nthat list of 392 if you\u2019re trying to narrow down the topic. For example, you could search on the term \u201ccities\u201d to see which of those\n392 articles are most likely to be about the economic impact of crime on cities.\nPractice Exercise 6.7.1\nChoose a research topic, enter it into Google and then into Google Scholar and then into your library's biggest database search\nengine.

It\u2019s an extended problem-solving exercise, an\niterative cycle of questions and answers. Go ahead and use Wikipedia to get broadly informed if you want. It won\u2019t corrupt your\nbrain. But use it, and all other sources, strategically. You should eventually arrive at a core set of Tier 1 sources that will enable you\nto make a well informed and thoughtful argument in support of your thesis. It\u2019s also a good sign when you find yourself deciding\nthat some of the first sources you found are no longer relevant to your thesis; that likely means that you have revised and specified\nyour thinking and are well on your way to constructing the kind of self-driven in-depth analysis that your professor is looking for.\nBrowsing for topics\nImagine you\u2019ve been assigned a research paper that can focus on any topic relevant to the course. Imagine further that you don\u2019t\nhave a clue about where to start and aren\u2019t entirely sure what counts as an appropriate topic in this discipline. A great approach is to\nfind the top journals in the specific field of your course and browse through recent issues to see what people are publishing on. For\nexample, when I assign an open-topic research paper in my Introduction to Sociology course, I suggest that students looking for a\ntopic browse recent issues of Social Problems or American Journal of Sociology and find an article that looks interesting. They\u2019ll\nhave a topic and\u2014booyah!\u2014their first source. An instructor of a class on kinesiology might recommend browsing Human\nMovement Science, the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, or Perceptual and Motor Skills.\nChoosing keywords for your topic\nWhen you have a topic and are looking for a set of sources, your biggest challenge is finding the right keywords. You\u2019ll obviously\nstart with words and phrases from the assignment prompt, but you can\u2019t stop there. One strategy is to brainstorm keywords and\nkeep track of what you have tried in a table like this one:\nComing up with Alternate Keywords\nInitial Alternate word Alternate word Related Terms\nkeywords or phrase or phrase\nExample\niPhones and iPhone: privacy: data, data sharing,\nprivacy Apple, smart security, liberty, data harvesting,\nphone, android surveillance data economy, data\nprivacy, data\ncollection, digital\nfootprint, informed\nconsent, privacy\npolicy\nFill-in your topic\n& keywords as\nyou work\nAs explained above, lower-tier sources (such as Wikipedia) or the top-tier sources you already have are great for identifying\nalternative keywords, and librarians and other library staff are also well-practiced at finding new approaches to try. Librarians can\nalso point you to the best databases for your topic as well.\n6.8.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29513 Returning to find more sources\nAs you assess your evidence and further develop your thesis through the writing process, you may need to seek additional sources.\nFor example, imagine you\u2019re writing a paper about the added risks adolescents face when they have experienced their parents\u2019\ndivorce. As you synthesize the evidence about negative impacts, you begin to wonder if scholars have documented some positive\nimpacts as well. You go back and search until you find a fairly recent article such as Ilana Sever, Joseph Gutmann, and Amnon\nLazar, \u201cPositive Consequences of Parental Divorce Among Israeli Young Adults\u201d, Marriage and Family Review 42, no. 4 (2007):\n7-28. Thus you delve back into the literature to look for more articles, find some more concepts and keywords (such as\n\u201cresiliency\u201d), assess new evidence, and revise your thinking to account for these broader perspectives. Your instructor may have\nasked you to turn in a bibliography weeks before the final paper draft. You can check with your professor, but he or she is probably\nperfectly fine with you seeking additional sources as your thinking evolves. That\u2019s how scholars write.\nPractice Exercise 6.8.1\nYou can download the (cid:0)keywords worksheet or copy the Google doc keywords worksheet to complete the exercise.\n1. Start with a phrase to describe a topic that interests you. Use a keywords table like the one above to generate alternate and\nrelated search terms.\n2. Do a search on your original phrase and list the three best sources you come up with. Then do five additional searches,\neach one for a different related term or combination of terms taken from your keywords table. For each search, copy the\ntitles and links for any good sources you find.\n3. Reflect on which phrases led you to the sources that most interest you. Did you learn anything about how your topic is\nmost commonly described? Do any alternate keywords suggest new ways to focus your topic?\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence by Amy Guptill, published by Open SUNY\nTextbooks, licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n6.8: Strategies for Each Phase of the Research Process is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nLibreTexts.\n6.8.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/29513 6.9: Creating an Annotated Bibliography\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (8 min, 3 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 88::0033\nOverview\nInstructors often assign an annotated bibliography, a useful tool to beginning a research paper which allows you to evaluate and cite\nyour sources. Most often, an annotated bibliography is a list of sources on a particular topic that includes a brief summary of what\neach source is about, an assessment of the source\u2019s reliability, and an overview of how you will use the source in your essay. Here\nis an example:\nSample annotated bibliography entry\nMorey, Darcy F. \u201cBurying Key Evidence: the Social Bond between Dogs and People.\u201d Journal of Archaeological Science, vol.\n33, no. 2, Feb. 2006, pp. 158\u2013175., doi:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jas.2005.07.009.\nIn this article, Morey documents the widespread human practice of burying domesticated dogs and questions what this practice\ncan reveal about relationships between the two. He argues that dog burials have been more frequent and more consistent than\nburials of other types of animals, suggesting that humans have invested dogs with spiritual and personal identities. Morey also\ndemonstrates that the study of dog burials can help scholars to more accurately date the domestication of dogs; thus, he\nchallenges scholars who rely solely on genetic data in their dating of domestication to consider more fully the importance of\narchaeological finds. To support his arguments, Morey provides detailed data on the frequency, geographic and historical\ndistribution, as well as modes of dog burials and compares the conclusions he draws from this data to those found by\nscholarship based on genetic data. He is also a well-known anthropology scholar and Ph.D candidate at the University of\nWyoming. This article is useful to a literature review on the domestication of dogs because it persuasively shows the\nimportance of using burial data in dating dog domestication and explains how use of this data could change assessments of\nwhen domestication occurred. I will likely use it to develop my first body paragraph.\nSections of each annotated bibliography entry\nAnnotated bibliography entries have two parts. The top of the entry is the citation. It is the part that lists information like the name\nof the writer, where the evidence appeared, the date of publication, and other publishing information. Composition classes typically\nuse MLA format, but other formats like APA and Chicago are popular in other disciplines. To learn more about MLA format and\nhow to make a perfect citation, check out the section on MLA format and works cited pages (add link).\nThe second part of the entry is the summary and evaluation of the evidence being cited. A good annotation provides enough\ninformation to help you and others understand what the research is about, why it is (or isn\u2019t) reliable, and how you may use it in\nyour essay.\nSummary\nSummaries can be challenging when we are trying to write them about longer and more complicated sources of research. Review\nChapter 3: Writing a Summary of Another Writer\u2019s Argument to review best practices for summary writing. Chapter 3 mostly\nfocuses on extended summaries of shorter texts, but in an annotated bibliography, we will often find yourself needing to put a large\ntext into a few sentences. How can we do so?\nKeep these guidelines in mind:\nKeep your summary short. Good summaries for annotated bibliographies are not \u201ccomplete\u201d summaries; rather, they provide\nthe highlights of the evidence in as brief and concise a manner as possible.\n6.9.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/122936 Summarize what you find helpful. You definitely won\u2019t need to quote every part of an academic journal in your essay. For\nthat reason, your summary only needs to include what is most relevant to your research essay topic.\nNo need to quote from what you are summarizing. Summaries will be more useful to you if you write them in your own\nwords. Instead of quoting directly what you think is the point of the piece of evidence, try to paraphrase it.\nUse abstracts to help you, but paraphrase them in your own words. Many of the periodical indexes that are available as part\nof your library\u2019s computer system include abstracts of articles. Of course, copying the exact words from the abstract would be\nplagiarism. Paraphrasing in your own words in the annotated bibliography will help you understand and explain in preparation\nfor writing your paper.\nSample summary\nIn this article, Morey documents the widespread human practice of burying domesticated dogs and questions what this practice\ncan reveal about relationships between the two. He argues that dog burials have been more frequent and more consistent than\nburials of other types of animals, suggesting that humans have invested dogs with spiritual and personal identities. Morey also\ndemonstrates that the study of dog burials can help scholars to more accurately date the domestication of dogs; thus, he\nchallenges scholars who rely solely on genetic data in their dating of domestication to consider more fully the importance of\narchaeological finds.\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation aspect of an annotation can help you decide if a text has any fallacies, reasons, or assumptions that impact the\nreliability. Chapter 4: Assessing the Strength of an Argument provides many useful templates for beginning your assessment of a\nsource\u2019s reliability.\nSample evaluation\nTo support his arguments, Morey provides detailed data on the frequency, geographic and historical distribution, as well as\nmodes of dog burials and compares the conclusions he draws from this data to those found by scholarship based on genetic\ndata. He is also a well-known anthropology scholar and Ph.D candidate at the University of Wyoming.\nConnection to the essay\nOnce you summarize and evaluate the source, very briefly show the reader how you intend to use the source. Consider the\nfollowing:\nWhat parts of the source connect to your particular topic and argument?\nWhere might you incorporate this source?\nDoes the source support a particular idea you want to promote or refute?\nSample connection to the essay\nThis article is useful to a literature review on the domestication of dogs because it persuasively shows the importance of using\nburial data in dating dog domestication and explains how use of this data could change assessments of when domestication\noccurred. I will likely use it to develop my first body paragraph.\nAnnotated bibliography template\nYou may want to use this annotated bibliography template, created by Andrew Gurevich, to format your annotated bibliography.\nHere are the steps to use it:\n1. Make sure you are signed in to Google.\n2. Open the template.\n3. Go to \u201cFile\u201d in Google docs and select \u201cMake a copy.\u201d\n4.

By following these conventions, we build our credibility because we signal to\nreaders that we are part of the larger conversation and aware of its customs. For English classes and a variety of humanities\ndisciplines, the agreed-upon style is called MLA. For other classes, you may also be asked to format your papers in APA or\nChicago Style.\nThe following sample paper shows how the first page of a paper written in MLA is formatted. Note the header information in the\nupper-left corner, the last name and page numbers in the upper-right corner, the double-spaced text, and indentations that begin\neach paragraph:\nText description of the MLA-formatted sample paper\nUse a Template\nThe simplest way to get the format right is to use a template. You can download this (cid:0)MLA format essay template and open it in\nany word processing program. (You can also make a copy of the Google Docs template rather than downloading.) Then\njust replace the text with your own name, title, and essay. A slightly different way is to create a new document in Google Docs,\n6.10.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120162 Pages, or Microsoft Word and use the built-in template for MLA essays. You'll want to choose the option to create a new document\nfrom a template and then search the template gallery for \"MLA,\" which may be categorized under \"Education.\"\nGeneral MLA Formatting Rules\nIf you prefer not to use a template, you can also manually format your essay.\nFont: Your paper should be written in 12-point text. Whichever font you choose, MLA requires that regular and italicized text\nbe easily distinguishable from each other. Times and Times New Roman are often recommended.\nLine Spacing: All text in your paper should be double-spaced.\nMargins: All page margins (top, bottom, left, and right) should be 1 inch. All text should be left justified.\nIndentation: The first line of every paragraph should be indented 0.5 inches.\nPage Numbers: Create a right-justified header 0.5 inches from the top edge of every page. This header should include your last\nname, followed by a space and the page number. Your pages should be numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3\u2026) and should\nstart with the number 1 on your title page. Most word-processing programs have the ability to automatically add the correct\npage number to each page so you don\u2019t have to do this by hand.\nUse of Italics: In MLA style, you should italicize (rather than underline) the titles of books, plays, or other standalone works\n(shorter works such as articles or speeches should be in quotation marks with no italics). You should also italicize (rather than\nunderline) words or phrases you want to lend particular emphasis\u2014though you should do this rarely.\nThe first page: Like the rest of your paper, everything on your first page, even the headers, should be double-spaced. The\nfollowing information should be left justified in regular font at the top of the first page (in the main part of the page, not the\nheader):\non the first line, your first and last name\non the second line, your instructor\u2019s name\non the third line, the name of the class\non the fourth line, the date\nThe title: After the header, the next double-spaced line should include the title of your paper. This should be centered and in\ntitle case, and it should not be bolded, underlined, or italicized (unless it includes the name of a book, in which case just the\nbook title should be italicized).\nAdditional resources\nVisit the Modern Language Association website to see an example of a student paper following MLA guidelines. You can also\nread more on the MLA website about correctly formatting your document.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from English Composition I: MLA Document Formatting, provided by Lumen Learning and licensed CC\nBY-SA.\n6.10: MLA Essay Format is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n6.10.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120162 6.11: MLA In-Text Citations\nNote\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nIn MLA style, titles of long works like books are italicized\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 22 sec): while shorter works are placed in quotation marks.

In that sense, every argument has the same purpose.\nHowever, there are different kinds of beliefs we might want to encourage and different attitudes we might take toward those beliefs.\nBesides, we may want an argument not just to convince but to lead to action. Sometimes the purpose goes beyond just \u201cBelieve\nme!\u201d For example, when the argument is part of an advertisement, the goal is clear: \"Buy me!\" The goal of a stump speech is to\nget listeners to cast their votes in support of a candidate. Sometimes, the purpose is simply to struggle with a topic in order to begin\nto come up with an informed opinion. Many times, the purpose of a piece of writing is to encourage critical thinking on a subject,\nand maybe change something wrong in our world in response.\nPhoto by Magda Ehlers on Pexels, under the Pexels License.\nFor example, we could set out to write about global warming for different purposes. We might simply aim to make people believe\nthat global warming is real. Alternately, we might try to convince readers to make drastic changes in their lives to combat climate\nchange, or to protest a particular company responsible for climate change. Our purpose will shape the ideas we express, but it will\nalso shape the emotional appeals we make.\nIdentifying our purpose can help us decide what we need to include to achieve that purpose. Often arguments with a particular\nkind of purpose will share common features. Below we will describe four kinds of research-based essays, each of which we will\nexplore in more depth in a later section of this chapter.\nPurposes for research papers\nWe can ask ourselves which of the following best describes our purpose:\nWe want to describe the nature of something.\nWe want to assess how good or bad something is.\nWe want to demonstrate that one thing causes or caused another.\nWe want to propose some action.\nAn argument may contain multiple elements from this list, but if we can decide which is ultimately the most important, we can\nshape the introduction and conclusion with that goal in mind. Each type of argument has particular questions that may be worth\naddressing, as we will explore in the later sections.\nIn the following sections, we suggest strategies and components of four different types of arguments, matched to the four purposes\nmentioned above.\nDefinition arguments describe the nature of something or identify a pattern or trend. Generally speaking, they answer the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n7.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/122942 Evaluation arguments assess something according to particular criteria. They answer the question, \u201cHow good or bad is it?\u201d\nCausal arguments attempt to show that one thing leads to or has led to another. They answer the question, \u201cWhat caused it?\u201d\nProposal arguments present a case for action. They answer the question, \u201cWhat should we do about it?\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at some examples of argument purposes divided into these categories.\nDefinition argument examples\nWe want readers to know what kinds of communication dolphins are capable of.\nWe want to clarify which groups of people the term \u201cLatinx\u201d refers to.\nWe want to show how Kurdish communities differ in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.\nEvaluation argument examples\nWe want to recommend a gaming device.\nWe want to convince readers that the Supreme Court decision to give corporations First Amendment rights to free speech was\nmisguided.\nWe want to show that a new Alzheimer\u2019s drug meets the criteria for emergency use authorization.\nCausal argument examples\nWe want to argue that the attack on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021 actually made Americans value American\ndemocracy more and want to protect it.\nWe want to show that parents can\u2019t change a child\u2019s feeling of being male, female, or nonbinary.\nWe want to suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic led to an increase in internet addiction.\nProposal argument examples\nWe want readers to take the online Harvard Implicit Association Tests and reflect on what the results suggest about their\nunconscious biases.\nWe want legislators to double the gas tax in order to speed up the transition to clean energy.\nWe want to make community college free for all Americans.\nComparing and contrasting for different purposes\nIt's worth noting that we may want to discuss more than one thing for any of the purposes above. If we are comparing and\ncontrasting two or more things in our essay, we will want to think about essay structure for compare and contrast essays as well as\nthinking about the elements of the argument according to the overall purpose. See Section 3.9: Comparing and Contrasting\nArguments for more on this.\nPractice exercise 7.1.1\nFor each argument below, select the category that best describes the argument\u2019s purpose. Explain how it fits the category.\n1. Muslim women should be allowed to wear full face and body coverings such as burkas in public if they choose.\n2. Minecraft play offers many opportunities for creativity and learning.\n3. The explosion of mental health content on TikTok has reduced the shame many people feel about their mental health issues.\n4. Only apartments where the rent is less than 30% of a minimum wage worker\u2019s income can truly be considered \u201caffordable\nhousing.\u201d\n5.

As such, each time you get stuck on a word or\nsentence, it may be up to you alone to move past that writer\u2019s block. However, that\u2019s simply not true. Beyond the support of your\ninstructor, peers, or tutors, you have an audience that you\u2019re writing to that can help you generate ideas and stay focused. The more\nwe imagine our audience's likely reactions as part of the writing process, the more likely we are to generate ideas, reach them, and\nconvince them or affect their thinking. Why? Because, as we saw in Section 9.1, an argument implies a relationship. So, read on to\nfind out more about how you can work together with your audience to develop your paper.\n\"Audience listens at Startup School\" by Robert Scoble is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nAudience Awareness in the Writing Process\nAnalyzing your audience affects nearly every stage of your writing, from early drafting to how you revise and get to the final draft.\nBeyond writing to answer a prompt, at a really basic level, you\u2019re writing to be read, by your peers, your professor, or by any\naudience designated in your prompt. To do this effectively, consider the following questions. Many of these considerations already\nhappen intuitively when we talk with other people. When we're writing we need to be a bit more conscious about imagining the\naudience.\nWhat does your audience probably already know about your topic? Depending on how much your audience knows, there may\nbe background information you should include or leave out. For example, if we are writing on global warming in an English\nComposition class for an audience of an English professor and assorted students, we might need to use more detailed\nexplanations for scientific concepts. However, if we are writing on global warming in an upper-level environmental science\nclass, we can assume that our audience is more well-versed in the basics of climate science. We wouldn't need to explain the\ndetails of the greenhouse effect works and could probably use more jargon from the discipline without defining every term.\nHow is your audience likely to feel about your topic? A skeptical audience needs more evidence than an open-minded one. Is\nthe audience likely to have a prejudice or misconception that needs to be addressed? Assessing how your audience feels may\nalso be the key to finding common ground. Refer to 9.8: Reaching a Hostile Audience for more information.\n7.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127337 What new information can you provide? New information about a topic or its purpose can keep the audience engaged in a way\nrehashing old information cannot.\nWhat is your relationship to the audience? This can affect your tone and how much of yourself you insert into the paper. For\nexample, addressing an authority figure would require a different approach than addressing a relative peer or a complete\nstranger.\nThe Effect of Audience on Style\nLike a conversation, in addition to your audience affecting what you say, your audience can sometimes affect how you say that\ncontent as well. The following items are some things to consider:\nPurpose: What does your audience care about or believe in? What will move your audience to act? It will help your paper if\nyou can align its purpose with something the audience cares about. See 9.6: Moral Character for more information on this.\nBacking: What kind of evidence will convince your audience? Remember what looks like strong evidence to you may appear\nflimsy to your audience.\nSentence Type and Length: Should you use long and complex sentences? Or short ones? The reading level of your paper\nshould match the reading level of your audience.\nLevel of Formality: Should you use technical jargon? Or slang? Avoid the temptation to \u2018sound academic\u2019 with technical\nwords and phrases unless the situation calls for it.\nTone: Formal or informal? Serious or humorous? Distanced or personal? Hitting the right tone will help your audience take you\nmore seriously. Consider checking out 8.4: Tone or 9.3: Distance and Intimacy for more resources related to this.\nReaching Out to the Audience\nMany audiences form an opinion about what they read by the end of the introduction. Take advantage of this information to make\nsure you make a positive first impression. Try to pick a title that your audience may recognize or resonate with. Work on a hook\nthat is geared towards your audience (as opposed to something that is purely provocative or attention-grabbing). Consider making a\ndirect appeal to your audience in the introduction, and end your introduction with a thesis statement modeled after the values you\nknow your reader will identify with. Check out 7.1: Introductions for more information about this.\nAddressing a Diverse Audience\nImage by OnlineStreet, licensed CC BY 4.0.\nWhile the previous points have been geared towards writing to a specific audience, the following items are some good practices to\nobserve for any audience you may encounter.\nRecognize your cultural filter: Cultures are formed from a variety of factors like class, gender, generation, religion, and\neducation. Your culture shapes how you view the world and can at times prevent you from understanding different backgrounds.\nDo your best to understand how your cultural values may be affecting your argument and how they may differ from your\naudience\u2019s.\nAvoid ethnocentrism: Assuming that your culture\u2019s values, customs, or beliefs are superior to another\u2019s is ethnocentrism. It\u2019s\nan attitude that can alienate your audience. Be careful not to assume that all cultural practices are shared. Suspend any\njudgments or cultural stereotypes.\n7.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127337 Adopt bias-free language: Biased language is tricky and has a way of sneaking into writing when you least expect it. While\nyou may think writing \u201cthe male lawyer\u201d provides important detail, including the lawyer\u2019s gender suggests the law is an\ninherently male or masculine profession. So, be mindful of any biased, sexist, or stereotypical language that may come from\nunconscious biases as you\u2019re writing and edit accordingly.\nAcknowledge issues of oppression. Similar to ethnocentrism, the language we write or speak might convey a negative bias\ntowards individuals or groups. If your message stereotypes a group, even unconsciously, you risk offending your audience.\nExamples of discriminating language to avoid include:\nRacism \u2013 Your audience will be diverse. By recognizing that there are many cultural frames of reference, you\u2019ll reach each\nreader or listener effectively. Unless it is necessary, avoid references to ethnicity.\nHeterosexism \u2013 If your essay or speech depicts a relationship, don\u2019t assume that each member of your audience is\nheterosexual.\nAgeism \u2013 Many pervasive stereotypes exist with regard to the age of individuals. If you write or speak about an elderly\nperson, challenge discriminating ideas such as \u201cold people are feeble\u201d or \u201cteenagers lack wisdom.\u201d\nSexism \u2013 Archaic sexist usage assumes one male term for all genders. Now we can use a singular they for this purpose (see\n13.7: Pronoun Agreement). Sexism suggests one sex or gender is inferior to another. Avoid sexist stereotypes such as the\nidea that females are emotional and men are logical. It's also important to avoid assuming that gender is binary or based only\non biology.\nAttribution\nMost of the above was adapted by Ryan Hitch from Composing Ourselves and Our World by Elizabeth Burrows, Angela\nFowler, Heath Fowler, and Amy Locklear, Auburn University at Montgomery, licensed CC BY 4.0.\nPortions of the above were written by Dylan Altman, licensed CC BY 4.0.\n7.2: Tailoring an Argument to an Audience is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n7.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127337 7.3: Definition Arguments\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (14 min, 32 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1144::3322\nWhat is a definition argument?\nA research-based argument may have as its goal to describe the nature of something, whether it be an abstract concept like justice,\na historical event, or an ongoing trend. Definition arguments like this are arguments because they seek to shape our vision of\nreality. We can think of them as answering the question \"What is it?\"\nPhoto by Gerd Altmann on PublicDomainPictures.net, licensed CC 0.\nDefinition arguments may attempt to explain what is meant by a particular term. Take the following claim:\nOrganic, in terms of food, means plants and animals raised without additives or artificial\ngrowing conditions.\nThe argument here hinges upon understanding the definition of the word \u201corganic.\u201d In this case, organic is the subject of the\nargument. The claim goes on to base the argument on definition criteria. The claim states that two definition criteria of \u201corganic\u201d\nare \u201craised without additives\u201d and \u201craised without artificial growing conditions.\u201d \"What do they mean by \u2018artificial\u2019?\u201d If you find\nyourself questioning other terms used in the claim, that might mean your argument will need to dedicate a paragraph or more to\ndefining those terms. An extended argument on organic food would need to explain in detail what distinguishes artificial growing\nconditions from natural ones. Can greenhouse-grown food be organic? In such a situation, it may benefit the argument to offer the\ndictionary definition of \u201corganic\u201d as a way to confirm that writer and the readers\u2019 assumptions are the same.\nThere are a number of online dictionaries that student authors can derive a definition from, but should the writer wish to ensure\ntrust (ethos) with the audience, the source of the dictionary definition might matter. The dictionary.com site offers this definition\nfor \u201corganic\u201d:\nOrganic: pertaining to, involving, or grown with fertilizers or pesticides of animal or\nvegetable origin, as distinguished from manufactured chemicals\u201d (\u201corganic\u201d).\nReaders who respect the history and legacy of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) might consider its definition more credible.\nConsidered the most definitive and complete dictionary available, the OED offers differentiated definitions of different uses of the\nword. In the case of \u201corganic,\u201d we\u2019d need to look at sub-definition 8c to find one that works for our purposes:\n7.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/33570 Organic: of food: produced without the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, or other\nartificial chemicals.\nA definition argument can put a more specific subject into a category based on criteria, as in the following:\nThough it omits hormones and antibiotics, organic ice cream remains unhealthy because\nit contains high levels of fat and sugar, while offering little nutritional value.\nHere we have a subject \u2013 organic ice cream \u2013 and a category \u2013 unhealthy. Presumably, unhealthy things often contain similar\ncriteria \u2013 high levels of fat and sugar, low nutritional value, and industrial additives. Organic ice cream might not contain industrial\nadditives, but, because it meets the other two criteria, it can still be considered unhealthy. A good way to test your thesis is to try\nout examples to see if the criteria work to distinguish things that fit the category from things that don't. Are other things we\nconsider unhealthy full of sugar and\/or fat, low in nutrition, and made with industrial additives? Yes. Fast food hamburgers are\nunhealthy because they contain high levels of fat, low nutritional value, and are full of chemical preservatives.\nDefinition arguments will need to provide evidence for any generalizations they make about a subject. If they use a specific\nexample, how can they show that the example is typical? They may also need to justify the choice of criteria for the definition. If\nwe argue that the Vietnam War should not be considered a \"World War\" even though it involved two global superpowers, the U.S.\nand the Soviet Union, we will need to explain why a criterion like the number of deaths should be considered more important than\nthe number or size of the countries involved.\nThe benefits of definition\nOnce we understand the value of definition for clarifying terms in an essay, we can start to appreciate the value of definition in\nshaping an argument, especially one centered around a contentious term. When controversy revolves around an issue, defining\nterms explicitly and precisely is even more critical. In Section 4.2: Check If the Meaning Is Clear, we saw how mixing different\nmeanings of one term can disguise a problem with the logic of an argument (if this is done intentionally, it is called equivocation).\nA definition argument can help avoid this kind of slippage, and it can clarify where disagreements lie. Even if it doesn't resolve the\ndisagreements, it may at least prevent misunderstandings.\nOne example lies in the definition of \"life\" in the abortion debate. Those on the pro-life side argue \"life\" is defined by the initial\nmeeting of sperm and egg, and the subsequent division of cells. On the other hand, those on the pro-choice side often argue that\n\"life\" is determined by autonomy, by the fetus's ability to survive outside the womb, and this, generally, is possible at twenty-four\nweeks. Prior to that, the fetus is fully dependent for survival upon the security of the woman's womb.\nTo take another example, let's say the government decides to allow health insurance providers to exclude coverage to individuals\nwith preexisting conditions. The question then arises, what precisely does constitute a preexisting condition? Any diagnosis of\ncancer, including minor skin cancers? Diabetes? Obesity? Hypertension? Consider how many of our friends and family members\nhave been diagnosed with any of these conditions.\nLaws rely on definitions. Many of us are familiar with the purpose of Title IX, which ensured that equal funding should be applied\nfor both male and female athletic programs in schools. However, with the recognition of transgender students and their rights, the\nU.S. Department of Education offered a statement of clarification to the language of Title IX: \u201cexplaining that it will enforce Title\nIX's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: (1) discrimination based on sexual orientation; and (2)\ndiscrimination based on gender identity\u201d (\u201cTitle IX\u201d). Schools, students, and parents can now point to this language in debates\nabout who is protected by Title IX status, and who can be included in the funding of gender-specific sports teams. Legal\ndefinitions often depend upon qualifiers, as in the case of the gun debate. Many on the pro-gun rights argument will not extend the\ndefinition of guns to include fully automatic guns; thus, they will often only agree with new gun restrictions that exclude AR 47s\nfrom such regulations.\nDefinitions involve emotional associations as well as descriptions of literal meaning. Public opinion can be swayed by casting a\nperson involved in a very public event as \"famous\" or \"infamous,\" a term that has decidedly negative connotations. In the case of\nTrayvon Martin, a young black man who was shot by George Zimmerman, a white man, Martin was defined alternately as a \"boy\nin a hoodie\" or as a \"potential thug.\" And Zimmerman was defined as \"a neighborhood watch leader\" or \"private citizen\" by some,\nand a \"vigilante\" by others. In each case, the label implies a definition of the person and his behavior, and this extends the\nimpression built in the mind of the audience.\n7.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/33570 Strategies for definition\nReferring to existing definitions\nA dictionary definition can be helpful if the term under consideration is new or very unusual or uncommon, words which readers\nmay be unfamiliar with, or whose definitions may have become obscured with modern use. If an argument takes the position that\nreduced literacy rates in freshman college students makes them less apt to learn from a professor who leans toward sesquipedalian\nspeech, yet, such speech is exactly the challenge these students need to pull them away from their social media feeds and engage\nthem in the vigorous mental workout that academia provides, the author is more likely to earn the trust of the audience if a\ndictionary definition is provided for this uncommon and archaic word: words that are a foot and a half long (O.E.D.).\nIdentifying emotional associations (connotations)\nEmotional associations offer the various levels of meaning a word may have. For example, love can have several variants, such as\nplatonic love, romantic love, familial love, passionate love, self-love, and even more specific ones, such as spirituality,\nphilanthropy, humanity, nationalism\/patriotism, and agap\u00e9, and each carries its own emotional tone which informs the definition.\nThe essay \"What is Poverty\" offers multiple connotations of poverty through the numerous illustrations.\nDefining a term based on what it\u2019s not (negation)\nSometimes complex words are best explained by what they are not, specifically by contrasting the word to another term. Needs are\noften confused with wants, but needs are anything necessary for survival. For example, people often say \"I need a vacation,\" when\nwhat they really mean is, \"I want a vacation.\" You may want coffee, but you need water. You may want a new car, but a used one\nmay suit your needs. In an article about sexual predators, Andrew Vachss says that when he tells people about the individuals he\nprosecutes for abuse against children, people often say, \"that's sick.\" But he clarifies that there is a difference between \"sick\" and\n\"evil.\" A mother who hears voices in her head telling her to lock her baby in a closet is sick. A man who sells a child to\npornographers is evil. \"Sickness,\" he says, \"is the absence of choice,\" while evil is the volition, the awareness of choice, and the\nintentional choice to commit a sinister act (Vachss).\nCreating an original definition (stipulation)\nThis use of definition asks the reader to accept an alternate definition from the standard or commonly accepted one. This is usually\nthe best way to utilize definition in an essay, as it allows the author the freedom to put his or her own spin on a key term. But the\nauthor must do it responsibly, providing supportive examples. For example, many young people believe that true parental love is\nthe willingness to do anything at all for a child. However, real love isn't expressed by doormat behavior. A parent who does his\nchild's homework so the child receives all \"A\" grades isn't demonstrating love {note the use of negation here}. Rather, true\nparental love is the willingness to apply fair rules and limits on behavior in order to raise a child who is a good worker, a good\nfriend, and a good citizen.\nElaborating on a definition (extended definition)\nThere is no rule about how long a definition argument should be. When a simple one-line definition will not suffice, writers can\ndevelop a multi-paragraph, multi-page or multi-chapter definition argument. For example, a newspaper article might explore at\nlength what is meant by the phrase \"cancel culture.\" An entire book each might be needed to explain what is meant by the\nfollowing terms: \"critical race theory,\" \"microagression,\" \"gender identity,\" \"fascism,\" or \"intersectionality.\" When the concept\nunder examination is complex, contentious, or weighted by historical examples and emotional connotations, an extended definition\nmay be needed.\nSample definition arguments\nThis sample outline for an essay titled \"When Colleges Talk about Diversity, Equity, and Antiracism, What Do They Mean?\" shows\nthe structure of one definition argument.\nThe student essay \"Defining Stereotypes\" by Imanol Juarez can serve as another example. Annotations on this essay point out how\nJuarez uses several definition argument strategies.\n(cid:0)Sample definition essay \"Defining Stereotypes\" in PDF version with margin notes\nSample definition essay \"Defining Stereotypes\" accessible version with notes in parentheses.\n7.3.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/33570 Practice Exercise 7.3.1\nHow are attitudes to gender changing in today\u2019s society?

As people, we often consider ourselves to be multifaceted, complex beings. (Note: The author opens the essay\nwith a personal question, a strategy to get the reader's attention.) Yet in every culture people stereotype others, and oversimplified\nbeliefs about people and cultures have a negative impact every day. (Note: A literal definition of the word \"stereotypes.\") Even\nthough America\u2019s society is exceptional in positive ways, it is also exceptional in its use of stereotypes, which can be seen through\nthe racism that still pervades the U.S. Stereotyping is a form of racism that creates a single depiction of a group of people based on\none aspect of their identity. (Note: The thesis defines stereotypes and the criteria the essay will use to explain this definition.)\nMost cultures intentionally or unintentionally manipulate the images of a certain group or person, and as a result, stereotypical\ndepictions are a widespread form of racism. (Note: The essay focuses on the connotation of stereotypes and how they function in\nthe U.S.)For example, the Ferris State University\u2019s Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia can give a dark glimpse into racist\ndepictions of Latinos: \u201cThe stereotypical depictions of Mexicans, especially those thought to be in the United States illegally, are\nharsh and demeaning. The men are portrayed as illiterate criminals. The women are depicted as hypersexual. Both men and women\nare portrayed as lazy, dirty, physically unattractive menaces\u201d (Ferris State). (Note: Evidence for the assertion that stereotypes are\nracist.) In extreme cases, racial profiling can be considered a form of stereotyping. Racial profiling is \u201cthe use of race or ethnicity\nas grounds for suspecting someone of having committed an offense.\u201d One example of racial profiling took place on February 23,\n2020, when two white men took the life of a young 26-year-old African American man named Ahmad Marquez Arbery while he\nwas jogging around his neighborhood: \u201cGregory McMichael told the police that he thought Mr. Arbery looked like a man suspected\nin several break-ins in the area,\u201d demonstrating the most abhorrent outcome of racist stereotypes (New York Times).\nSome may argue that there is such a thing as a good stereotype, but all stereotypes are inherently racist. (Note: Juarez addresses the\ncounterargument to his definition of stereotypes.) Yes, many cultures have stereotypes that are positive, but are they truly\nbeneficial? Sam Killermann states in \u201c3 Reasons Positive Stereotypes Aren't That Positive,\u201d \u201cPositive stereotypes exist for just\nabout every identity and have the capacity to be just as damaging as the negative ones.\u201d Take the stereotype that people of Asian\ndescent are good at math. Positive stereotypes not only set standards high but also discourage individuals from performing; good\nstereotypes can also alienate individuals and make them depressed because they don\u2019t have the characteristics everybody believes\nthey have. (Note: The definition argument leads to a causal argument about how positive stereotyping can impact people.) There\nare many forms of stereotypes, but one thing is for sure: there is never such a thing as a good stereotype.\n(Note: The Works Cited page uses MLA documentation style appropriate for an English class.)\nWorks Cited\n\u201cMexican and Latino Stereotypes.\u201d Mexican and Latino Stereotypes - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University,\nwww.ferris.edu\/HTMLS\/news\/jimcrow\/mexican.htm.\n1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92707 Sam Killermann. \u201c3 Reasons Positive Stereotypes Aren't That Positive.\u201d It's Pronounced Metrosexual, Sam Killermann\nwww.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com\/2012\/04\/reasons-positive-stereotypes-are-not-positive\/.\nThe New York Times. \u201cAhmaud Arbery Shooting: A Timeline of the Case.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 8 May\n2020, www.nytimes.com\/article\/ahmaud-arbery-timeline.html.\nAttribution\nThis sample essay was written by Imanol Juarez, annotated by Natalie Peterkin, and edited by Anna Mills, licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nAnnotated Sample Definition Argument is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92707 Sample Definition Outline\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (3 min, 33 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 33::3333\nWhen Colleges Talk about Diversity, Equity, and Antiracism, What Do They Mean?\nI.

We are faced with\nquestions like the following:\nDoes our employer treat us fairly?\nDoes our local cafe deserve five stars or four?\nIs the \u201cFree City\u201d program that makes City College of San Francisco tuition free for residents a success?\nIs a particular hillside a good location for a wind farm?\nDoes the president deserve their current approval rating?\nTo answer each of these questions and convince others that our answer is valid, we would need to make an evaluation argument.\nMost commonly, evaluation arguments rate their subject on a scale from positive to negative. Evaluation arguments make a claim\nabout the quality of something. We can think of them as answering the question \"How good or bad is it?\"\nA convincing evaluation depends on careful thought about the criteria.\nPhoto by Liza Summer from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nCriteria\nEvaluation arguments usually need to define and justify the criteria they use to make the evaluation. These criteria may consist of\nmoral standards, aesthetic standards, or tests of successful functioning. Depending on how controversial the criteria are, the\nargument may need to defend and explain why they have been chosen. How can we support our choice of criteria? We may cite\nprecedent or the authoritative sources in the field, or we may discuss the merit of the criteria in themselves by arguing for the good\nresults they lead to and aligning them with values we believe our audience will share.\nJudgment\nOnce we have convinced readers that the criteria for quality are valid, we will need to articulate our judgment about the extent to\nwhich the subject meets or doesn't meet those criteria.\nEvidence\nFinally, the argument will need to provide evidence of the way in which the subject meets or does not meet the criteria. See 4.4:\nDecide How Strong the Evidence Is and 12.5: Developing Paragraphs. for ideas on the types of evidence to choose from.\n7.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/37801 Ranking criteria\nIn cases where there are multiple valid criteria, the writer may need to rank them in order of importance and justify this ranking.\nFor example, an editorial supporting Alyesha Jenkins for mayor would need to explain what the city should be looking for in a\nmayor at the moment. The editorial might argue that the top priority should be finding someone who has a workable plan to address\nthe homelessness crisis. It might then go on to identify as secondary priority finding someone who has been an effective leader of a\nlarge organization. Finally, it might argue that finding a candidate who will focus on ending police brutality in the city should be\nthe third priority. Given these criteria, the argument might praise describe Alyesha Jenkins' concrete, popular plan on homelessness\nand background as a successful city supervisor and head of a law firm. It might note that her record on police brutality is limited,\nbut we still judge her to be a strong candidate.\nTypes of criteria\nWe can classify evaluative arguments by the kind of criteria they use. They may focus on aesthetics, that is the appearance or\nappeal of something (a movie, a work of art, or a building), or practical concerns about how something functions, or moral\njudgements based on values.\nAesthetic Criteria\nWhat makes a great film can be an academic question or an everyday debate among friends going to the movies. Film critics and\nFilm Studies classes try to identify clear aesthetic criteria for award-worthy movies. Film blogger Tyler Schirado, who writes for\nthe San Diego Film festival, details criteria including acting quality, dialogue, pacing, plot coherence, cinematography, production\ndesign, and special effects. Each of those criteria could in turn include sub-criteria. For example, the criteria for the quality of the\nspecial effects might include both how innovative and how spectacular they are.\nOperational Criteria\nSometimes the criteria that matter are very practical. We use operational criteria when we are looking for certain concrete\nresults. What does the subject we are evaluating do? If we want to evaluate a new car\u2019s safety features, we will ended to see how\nit performs under challenging conditions. When the FDA evaluates and tests a new vaccine, they follow an set of procedures to test\nhow the vaccine affects first cells, then animal bodies, and finally human bodies. The FDA considers the results of all these\nprocedures to help it decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. And if the consumer has confidence in the FDA\u2019s standards for\ndata collection, they can use the criteria about the vaccine\u2019s past record of immune protection and side effects to help them decide\nwhether or not to get vaccinated.\nMoral Criteria\nAn evaluation argument based on moral criteria will claim that something is right or wrong. It will need to appeal to shared\nvalues or make a case for a particular value that serves as criteria. Some values are nearly universal, such as honesty,\nreasonableness, and fairness, as we will discuss in 9.6: Moral Character. However, even values that seem universal may be defined\ndifferently by different groups. We each grow up in an environment that instills a particular set of family or cultural or religious\nvalues. These help to shape our own sense of morality, or personal values and codes that we chose to live by.\nMany values may be unconsciously held, but a moral argument will need to articulate them explicitly in order to make its case.\nRemembering our discussion of assumptions in 4.5: Check the Argument\u2019s Assumptions, we recall that each argument is based\nupon spoken or unspoken beliefs (warrants), such as \u201cfree speech is worthy of protection,\u201d or \u201cdemocracy is desirable,\u201d or\n\u201ccheating is wrong.\u201d As we saw in 7.2: Tailoring an Argument to an Audience, it can be helpful to recognize our particular\naudience\u2019s values and see where they align with our own. Convincing readers that we share values can enhance the sense of trust\nbetween reader and writer, as we will see in Chapter 9: How Arguments Appeal to Trust and Connection (Ethos).\nAs an example, the Motion Pictures Academy includes some moral criteria as well as aesthetic criteria when it selects winners for\nBest Picture, Best Director, and Best Actors. Responding to the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, the Academy of Motion Pictures\ndecided to incorporate the value of inclusiveness into their criteria. In order to emphasize \u201cthe inclusion of people in\nunderrepresented groups, including women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people and those with cognitive or physical disabilities,\u201d\nthey developed a new set of criteria for nominations for Best Picture. The criteria state that starting in 2024, \u201cTo be eligible for best\npicture, a film must meet at least two standards across four categories: \u2018Onscreen Representation, Themes and Narratives,\u2019\n\u2018Creative Leadership and Project Team,\u2019 \u2018Industry Access and Opportunities\u2019 and \u2018Audience Development,\u2019 (Rottenberg). Each of\n7.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/37801 these new criteria responds to the demands for inclusivity and equity, and is evidence that criteria can and should evolve as social\nmorals evolve.\nComparative Evaluation\nMany times we will need to evaluate the worth of one subject in relation to another in order to judge which is better. Of course, we\nwill need to decide on the basis for comparison, or the criteria to be used, and make that basis clear. Then we will need to evaluate\neach subject according to the criteria. In comparisons, ranking the criteria will often be important because one subject may do\nbetter on one criterion and worse on another. We'll need to know which criterion is more important in order to decide which comes\nout ahead overall.\nThe point-by-point organizational technique described in 3.9: Comparing and Contrasting Arguments can be helpful in structuring\nsuch an essay because it allows us to write about one criterion at a time and see how both subjects compare on that one point before\nmoving on to the next criterion. For example, we might compare the job of being a nanny with the job of being a preschool\nteacher. In one section, we would compare earnings for each job, and in another section, we would discuss potential for\nprofessional growth. If nannies come out ahead on earnings and teachers come out ahead on professional growth opportunities,\nthen we will need to rank these criteria in order of importance to decide which job to recommend.\nSample evaluation arguments\nTo get a sense of what research-based evaluation arguments look like in college classes, see this sample evaluation argument essay\nprompt and the sample outline to match it.

We offer one sample argument outline to respond to the prompt.\nSample Evaluation Argument Prompt\nBackground\nEnvironmental groups and journalists choose many different approaches to engaging the public. Clearly, they need to raise\nawareness about urgent concerns, but they also need to consider what viewers will connect to emotionally. Some issues have direct\nadverse effects for humans, like toxins in the water we drink. Others have immediate effects on ecosystems, like the destruction of\nthe Amazon rainforest. Others, like endangered species such as elephants and whales, become symbols of human longing, empathy,\nand reverence.\nAssignment\nChoose one environmental issue you would recommend such groups to focus on and explain your choice. What makes this issue\nboth scientifically urgent and emotionally appealing? In order to make your case, consider how you will measure urgency (By\nstatistics on health impacts? Species extinction? Economic disruptions?) and how you will gauge the emotional appeal (By the\npopularity of past memes and documentaries and campaigns on the issue? By its connection to popular leisure activities? By how\nrelatable it is?).\nSample Evaluation Argument Outline\nPhoto by Mohamed Nashah on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nTitle: My Love is as Great as the Ocean: Engaging Citizen Oceanic Stewards\nI. Thesis Statement: Because of its scientific importance and its power in the human imagination, the ocean should be a focus of\nenvironmental advocacy.\nII. Topic Sentence: The ocean has symbolic resonance because in many cultures, it is connected with the birth of life and powerful\ngoddesses and gods.\n1. Mami Wata, a West African water goddess, is important to many in the African Diaspora and has her own priests today.\n2. In Hindu mythology and classic texts, Samudra and Varuna play key roles as gods of the ocean.\n7.4.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/130196 3. In Greek mythology, Eros, or love, gave birth to earth, Gaia, which included the sea.\n4. Greek gods like Poseidon and Roman Neptune have figured in western popular culture for many centuries.\n5. In the Ancient Summerian text Enuma Elish, the goddess Tiamat gives birth to all life by releasing her waters around Earth.\nIII. Topic Sentence: The ocean also has symbolic resonance because it gave rise to the first life forms.\n1. Ancient myths have their parallel in scientific fact.\n2. Science has popularized the idea that life likely originated in the oceans over 3 billion years ago.\n3. 2021 research into microbe fossils in South African gold mines supports the idea that life first formed in thermal vents on the\nsea floor.\nIII. Topic Sentence: Our visceral response to the ocean's presence is even more powerful than its symbolism.\n1. Our intuitive sensory and emotional response to the ocean is deep.\n2. We love the ocean because it\u2019s powerful; it humbles us with its relentless kinetic energy.\n3. It grounds us with its refreshing breeze and rhythmic waves, renewing our spirits.\n4. It promotes well-being: water contains negative ions which counter the positive ions that cause bad moods.\nIII. Topic Sentence: Oceans help heal our planet; they counteract various environmental problems.\n1. In addition to fast-disappearing rainforests, oceans provide the majority of our oxygen\n2. Recent climate science tells us we\u2019re at the tipping point. Oceans help maintain atmospheric temperatures by absorbing carbon\ndioxide.\nIV. Topic Sentence: Yet oceans are being profoundly damaged by human activities.\n1. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide, they get more acidic, which threatens species that depend on hard shells.\n2. Millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean every year, creating huge garbage patches.\n3. Overfishing has depleted fish stocks: there may be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050 unless trends change.\nConclusion: Perhaps if environmental groups focus more on spreading these ideas, many more people will help protect the ocean and feel\ntheir love for it grow.\n1. While science is an excellent reason to take action, our basic humanity should be commanding us to protect and cherish the\noceans that begat us.\n2. Love is the greatest quality humans possess and it can and should guide us to protect our mother ocean.\nAttributions\nOriginal content by Allison Murray with additions by Anna Mills, licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\n7.4.1: Sample Evaluation Argument Prompt and Outline is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nLibreTexts.\n7.4.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/130196 7.4.2: Annotated Sample Evaluation Argument\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (5 min, 25 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 55::2255\nFormat note: This version is accessible to screen reader users.

For a more traditional visual format, see (cid:0)the PDF version of \"Universal Health Care Coverage for the United\nStates.\"\nAnonymous Student\nAnonymous Professor\nEnglish 101\nUniversal Health Care Coverage for the United States\nThe United States is the only modernized Western nation that does not offer publicly funded health care to all its citizens; the costs\nof health care for the uninsured in the United States are prohibitive, and insurance companies are often more interested in profit\nmargins than providing health care. These conditions are incompatible with U.S. ideals and standards. Universal health care\ncoverage is a better system for all citizens because it is more cost-effective and upholds the value of human life. (Note: The thesis\nevaluates universal healthcare based on two specific criteria.)\nOne of the most common arguments against providing universal health care coverage (UHC) is that it will cost too much money,\nbut in fact, UHC is a cheaper option than private insurance if one considers all costs. (Note: This body paragraph addresses the\ncriteria of cost by answering the question, \"How cheap is universal healthcare?\" The author summarizes a counterargument about\ncost and then refutes it.) While providing health care for all U.S. citizens would cost a lot of money for every tax-paying citizen,\ncitizens need to examine exactly how much money it would cost, and more importantly, how much money is too much when it\ncomes to opening up health care for all. Those who have health insurance already pay a considerable amount of money, and those\nwithout coverage are charged unfathomable amounts. The cost of publicly funded health care versus the cost of current insurance\npremiums is unclear. In fact, some Americans, especially those in lower income brackets, could stand to pay less than their current\npremiums.\nUnder the current system, even patients with coverage must pay for some treatments out of pocket. (Note: This paragraph\ncontinues the discussion of cost, introducing a particular case in which the current system means high costs for patients.)Each day\nan American acquires a form of cancer, and the only effective treatment might be considered experimental by an insurance\ncompany and thus is not covered. The costs may be so prohibitive that the patient will either opt for a less effective, but covered,\ntreatment; opt for no treatment at all; or attempt to pay the costs of treatment and experience unimaginable financial consequences.\nMedical bills in these cases can easily rise into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is enough to force even wealthy\nfamilies out of their homes and into perpetual debt. Even though each American could someday face this unfortunate situation,\nmany still choose to take the financial risk. Instead of gambling with health and financial welfare, U.S. citizens should press their\nrepresentatives to set up UHC, where their coverage will be guaranteed and affordable.\nA common argument against UHC in the United States is that other comparable national health care systems, like that of England,\nFrance, or Canada do not deliver timely patient care. (Note: Introduces a counterargument.) UHC opponents claim that sick\npatients in these countries often wait in long lines or long wait lists for basic health care. A fair amount of truth lies in these claims,\nbut Americans must remember to put those problems in context with the problems of the current U.S. system as well. (Note: The\nauthor admits seeing some merit in the counterargument before they go on to offer a rebuttal.)It is true that people often wait to see\na doctor in countries with UHC, but we in the United States wait as well, and we often schedule appointments weeks in advance,\nonly to have onerous waits in the doctor\u2019s waiting rooms.\n7.4.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92713 Even if UHC would cost Americans a bit more money each year, we ought to reflect on what type of country we would like to live\nin, and what types of morals we represent if we are more willing to deny health care to others on the basis of saving a few hundred\ndollars per year. (Note: This paragraph focuses on the criteria of values.)In a system that privileges capitalism and rugged\nindividualism, little room remains for compassion and love. It is time that Americans realize the amorality of U.S. hospitals forced\nto turn away the sick and poor. UHC is a health care system that aligns more closely with the core values that so many Americans\nespouse and respect, and it is time to realize its potential.\nDespite the opponents\u2019 claims against UHC, a universal system will save lives and encourage the health of all Americans. It is time\nfor Americans to start thinking socially about health in the same ways they think about education and police services: as a right of\nU.S. citizens.\nAttributions\nAdapted from an essay included in Writing for Success, licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.

They answer the question \"What caused it?\" Causes are\noften complex and multiple. Before we choose a strategy for a causal argument it can help to identify our purpose. Why do we need\nto know the cause? How will it help us?\nPurposes of causal arguments\nTo get a complete picture of how and why something happened\nIn this case, we will want to look for multiple causes, each of which may play a different role. Some might be background\nconditions, others might spark the event, and others may be influences that sped up the event once it got started. In this case, we\noften speak of near causes that are close in time or space to the event itself, and remote causes, that are further away or further in\nthe past. We can also describe a chain of causes, with one thing leading to the next, which leads to the next. It may even be the\ncase that we have a feedback loop where a first event causes a second event and the second event triggers more of the first,\ncreating an endless circle of causation. For example, as sea ice melts in the arctic, the dark water absorbs more heat, which warms\nit further, which melts more ice, which makes the water absorb more heat, etc. If the results are bad, this is called a vicious circle.\nTo decide who is responsible\nSometimes if an event has multiple causes, we may be most concerned with deciding who bears responsibility and how much. In a\ncar accident, the driver might bear responsibility and the car manufacturer might bear some as well. We will have to argue that the\nresponsible party caused the event but we will also have to show that there was a moral obligation not to do what the party did.\nThat implies some degree of choice and knowledge of possible consequences. If the driver was following all good driving\nregulations and triggered an explosion by activating the turn signal, clearly the driver cannot be held responsible.\nIn order to determine that someone is responsible, there must be a clearly defined domain of responsibility for that person or\nentity. To convince readers that a certain party is responsible, readers have to agree on what the expectations for that party in their\nparticular role are. For example, if a patient misreads the directions for taking a drug and accidentally overdoses, does the drug\nmanufacturer bear any responsibility? What about the pharmacist? To decide that, we need to agree on how much responsibility the\nmanufacturer has for making the directions foolproof and how much the pharmacist has for making sure the patient understands\nthem. Sometimes a person can be held responsible for something they didn't do if the action omitted fell under their domain of\nresponsibility.\nTo figure out how to make something happen\nIn this case we need to zero in on a factor or factors that will push the event forward. Such a factor is sometimes called a\nprecipitating cause. The success of this push will depend on circumstances being right for it, so we will likely also need to\ndescribe the conditions that have to be in place for the precipitating cause to actually precipitate the event. If there are likely\nfactors that could block the event, we need to show that those can be eliminated. For example, if we propose a particular surgery to\nfix a heart problem, we will also need to show that the patient can get to a hospital that performs the surgery and get an\nappointment. We will certainly need to show that the patient is likely to tolerate the surgery.\nTo stop something from happening\nIn this case, we do not need to describe all possible causes. We want to find a factor that is so necessary to the bad result that if we\nget rid of that factor, the result cannot occur. Then if we eliminate that factor, we can block the bad result. If we cannot find a single\nsuch factor, we may at least be able to find one that will make the bad result less likely. For example, to reduce wildfire risk in\nCalifornia, we cannot get rid of all fire whatsoever, but we can repair power lines and aging gas and electric infrastructure to reduce\n7.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/37805 the risk that defects in this system will spark a fire. Or we could try to reduce the damage fires cause by focusing on clearing\nunderbrush.\nTo predict what might happen in future\nAs Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor put it in A Rhetoric of Argument, \"When you argue for a prediction, you try to convince\nyour reader that all the causes needed to bring about an event are in place or will fall into place.\" You also may need to show that\nnothing will intervene to block the event from happening. One common way to support a prediction is by comparing it to a past\nevent that has already played out. For example, we might argue that humans have survived natural disasters in the past, so we will\nsurvive the effects of climate change as well. As Fahnestock and Secor point out, however, \"the argument is only as good as the\nanalogy, which sometimes must itself be supported.\" How comparable are the disasters of the past to the likely effects of climate\nchange? The argument would need to describe both past and possible future events and convince us that they are similar in severity.\nTechniques and cautions for causal argument\nSo how does a writer make a case that one thing causes another? The briefest answer is that the writer needs to convince us that the\nfactor and the event are correlated and also that there is some way in which the factor could plausibly lead to the event. Then the\nwriter will need to convince us that they have done due diligence in considering and eliminating alternate possibilities for the cause\nand alternate explanations for any correlation between the factor and the event.\nIdentify possible causes\nIf other writers have already identified possible causes, an argument simply needs to refer back to those and add in any that have\nbeen missed. If not, the writer can put themselves in the role of detective and imagine what might have caused the event.\nDetermine which factor is most correlated with the event\nIf we think that a factor may commonly cause an event, the first question to ask is whether they go together. If we are looking for a\nsole cause, we can ask if the factor is always there when the event happens and always absent when the event doesn't happen. Do\nthe factor and the event follow the same trends? The following methods of arguing for causality were developed by philosopher\nJohn Stuart Mill, and are often referred to as \"Mill's methods.\"\nIf the event is repeated and every time it happens, a common factor is present, that common factor may be the cause.\nIf there is a single difference between cases where the event takes place and cases where it doesn't.\nIf an event and a possible cause are repeated over and over and they happen to varying degrees, we can check whether they\nalways increase and decrease together. This is often best done with a graph so we can visually check whether the lines follow\nthe same pattern.\nFinally, ruling out other possible causes can support a case that the one remaining possible cause did in fact operate.\nExplain how that factor could have caused the event\nIn order to believe that one thing caused another, we usually need to have some idea of how the first thing could cause the second.\nIf we cannot imagine how one would cause another, why should we find it plausible? Any argument about agency, or the way in\nwhich one thing caused another, depends on assumptions about what makes things happen. If we are talking about human behavior,\nthen we are looking for motivation: love, hate, envy, greed, desire for power, etc. If we are talking about a physical event, then we\nneed to look at physical forces. Scientists have dedicated much research to establishing how carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\ncould effectively trap heat and warm the planet.\nIf there is enough other evidence to show that one thing caused another but the way it happened is still unknown, the argument can\nnote that and perhaps point toward further studies that would establish the mechanism. The writer may want to qualify their\nargument with \"may\" or \"might\" or \"seems to indicate,\" if they cannot explain how the supposed cause led to the effect.\nEliminate alternate explanations\nThe catchphrase \"correlation is not causation\" can help us to remember the dangers of the methods above. It's usually easy to\nshow that two things happen at the same time or in the same pattern, but hard to show that one actually causes another. Correlation\ncan be a good reason to investigate whether something is the cause, and it can provide some evidence of causality, but it is not\nproof. Sometimes two unrelated things may be correlated, like the number of women in Congress and the price of milk. We can\nimagine that both might follow an upward trend, one because of the increasing equality of women in society and the other because\nof inflation. Describing a plausible agency, or way in which one thing led to another, can help show that the correlation is not\n7.5.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/37805 random. If we find a strong correlation, we can imagine various causal arguments that would explain it and argue that the one we\nsupport has the most plausible agency.\nSometimes things vary together because there is a common cause that affects both of them. An argument can explore possible third\nfactors that may have led to both events. For example, students who go to elite colleges tend to make more money than students\nwho go to less elite colleges. Did the elite colleges make the difference? Or are both the college choice and the later earnings due to\na third cause, such as family connections? In his book Food Rules: An Eater's Manual, journalist Michael Pollan assesses studies\non the effects of supplements like multivitamins and concludes that people who take supplements are also those who have better\ndiet and exercise habits, and that the supplements themselves have no effect on health. He advises, \u201cBe the kind of person who\ntakes supplements -- then skip the supplements.\u201d\nIf we have two phenomena that are correlated and happen at the same time, it's worth considering whether the second phenomenon\ncould actually have caused the first rather than the other way around. For example, if we find that gun violence and violence within\nvideo games are both on the rise, we shouldn't leap to blame video games for the increase in shootings. It may be that people who\nplay video games are being influenced by violence in the games and becoming more likely to go out and shoot people in real life.\nBut could it also be that as gun violence increases in society for other reasons, such violence is a bigger part of people's\nconsciousness, leading video game makers and gamers to incorporate more violence in their games? It might be that causality\noperates in both directions, creating a feedback loop as we discussed above.\nProving causality is tricky, and often even rigorous academic studies can do little more than suggest that causality is probable or\npossible. There are a host of laboratory and statistical methods for testing causality. The gold standard for an experiment to\ndetermine a cause is a double-blind, randomized control trial in which there are two groups of people randomly assigned. One\ngroup gets the drug being studied and one group gets the placebo, but neither the participants nor the researchers know which is\nwhich. This kind of study eliminates the effect of unconscious suggestion, but it is often not possible for ethical and logistical\nreasons.\nThe ins and outs of causal arguments are worth studying in a statistics course or a philosophy course, but even without such a\ncourse we can do a better job of assessing causes if we develop the habit of looking for alternate explanations.\nSample annotated causal argument\nThe article \"Climate Explained: Why Carbon Dioxide Has Such Outsized Influence on Earth\u2019s Climate\" by Jason West, published\nin The Conversation, can serve as an example.

Not 0.4% or 4%, but 0.04%! How can it be so important in\nglobal warming if it\u2019s such a small percentage?\nI am often asked how carbon dioxide can have an important effect on global climate when its concentration is so small \u2013 just\n0.041% of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. And human activities are responsible for just 32% of that amount. (Note: Jason West presents his\narticle as a rebuttal to a counterargument.)\nI study the importance of atmospheric gases for air pollution and climate change. (Note: West establishes his credibility as a\nresearcher on the subject.)The key to carbon dioxide\u2019s strong influence on climate is its ability to absorb heat emitted from our\nplanet\u2019s surface, keeping it from escaping out to space. (Note: West summarizes his causal argument by explaining a mechanism\nthat could account for CO2's surprising effect on temperature.)\nEarly greenhouse science\nThe scientists who first identified carbon dioxide\u2019s importance for climate in the 1850s were also surprised by its influence. (Note:\nThis bit of history underlines West's sympathy for the surprise expressed in the opening question.)Working separately, John Tyndall\nin England and Eunice Foote in the United States found that carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane all absorbed heat, while\nmore abundant gases did not.\nScientists had already calculated that the Earth was about 59 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) warmer than it should be,\ngiven the amount of sunlight reaching its surface. The best explanation for that discrepancy was that the atmosphere retained heat\nto warm the planet.\nTyndall and Foote showed that nitrogen and oxygen, which together account for 99% of the atmosphere, had essentially no\ninfluence on Earth\u2019s temperature because they did not absorb heat. (Note: West shows how scientists eliminated what seemed like\nlikely causes for the warming effect.) Rather, they found that gases present in much smaller concentrations were entirely\nresponsible for maintaining temperatures that made the Earth habitable, by trapping heat to create a natural greenhouse effect.\nA blanket in the atmosphere\n(Note: Comparing heat-trapping gases to a blanket helps readers visualize the causal argument.)\n1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/82165 Earth constantly receives energy from the sun and radiates it back into space. For the planet\u2019s temperature to remain constant, the\nnet heat it receives from the sun must be balanced by outgoing heat that it gives off. (Note: West gives background on what\ninfluences the earth's temperature.)\nSince the sun is hot, it gives off energy in the form of shortwave radiation at mainly ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Earth is\nmuch cooler, so it emits heat as infrared radiation, which has longer wavelengths.\nFigure 2: The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all types of EM radiation \u2013 energy that travels and spreads out as it goes.\nThe sun is much hotter than the Earth, so it emits radiation at a higher energy level, which has a shorter wavelength. NASA\nCarbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases have molecular structures that enable them to absorb infrared radiation. The bonds\nbetween atoms in a molecule can vibrate in particular ways, like the pitch of a piano string. When the energy of a photon\ncorresponds to the frequency of the molecule, it is absorbed and its energy transfers to the molecule. (Note: This section establishes\nagency, an explanation for how CO2 could trap heat.)\nCarbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases have three or more atoms and frequencies that correspond to infrared radiation\nemitted by Earth. Oxygen and nitrogen, with just two atoms in their molecules, do not absorb infrared radiation. (Note: West\nexplains why two other possible causes of warming, oxygen and nitrogen, do not trap heat.)\nMost incoming shortwave radiation from the sun passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed. But most outgoing\ninfrared radiation is absorbed by heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Then they can release, or re-radiate, that heat. Some returns\nto Earth\u2019s surface, keeping it warmer than it would be otherwise.\nFigure 3: Earth receives solar energy from the sun (yellow), and returns energy back to space by reflecting some incoming light and\nradiating heat (red). Greenhouse gases trap some of that heat and return it to the planet\u2019s surface. NASA via Wikimedia. (Note:\nFigure 3, with the rightmost red stripe pointing back to earth, makes a visual argument that greenhouse gases trap heat.)\nResearch on heat transmission\nDuring the Cold War, the absorption of infrared radiation by many different gases was studied extensively. The work was led by the\nU.S. Air Force, which was developing heat-seeking missiles and needed to understand how to detect heat passing through air.\n2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/82165 This research enabled scientists to understand the climate and atmospheric composition of all planets in the solar system by\nobserving their infrared signatures. For example, Venus is about 870 F (470 C) because its thick atmosphere is 96.5% carbon\ndioxide. (Note: The comparison to Venus shows that a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere correlates with high\ntemperature on another planet.)\nIt also informed weather forecast and climate models, allowing them to quantify how much infrared radiation is retained in the\natmosphere and returned to Earth\u2019s surface.\nPeople sometimes ask me why carbon dioxide is important for climate, given that water vapor absorbs more infrared radiation and\nthe two gases absorb at several of the same wavelengths. The reason is that Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere controls the radiation that\nescapes to space. The upper atmosphere is much less dense and contains much less water vapor than near the ground, which means\nthat adding more carbon dioxide significantly influences how much infrared radiation escapes to space. (Note: In this paragraph,\nWest eliminates another possible driver of climate change, heat-trapping water vapor.)\nCarbon dioxide levels rise and fall around the world, changing seasonally with plant growth and decay.\nObserving the greenhouse effect\nHave you ever noticed that deserts are often colder at night than forests, even if their average temperatures are the same? Without\nmuch water vapor in the atmosphere over deserts, the radiation they give off escapes readily to space. In more humid regions\nradiation from the surface is trapped by water vapor in the air. Similarly, cloudy nights tend to be warmer than clear nights because\nmore water vapor is present.\nThe influence of carbon dioxide can be seen in past changes in climate. Ice cores from over the past million years have shown that\ncarbon dioxide concentrations were high during warm periods \u2013 about 0.028%. During ice ages, when the Earth was roughly 7 to\n13 F (4-7 C) cooler than in the 20th century, carbon dioxide made up only about 0.018% of the atmosphere. (Note: West gives\nmore evidence from Earth's history to show a correlation between high carbon dioxide concentration and higher temperatures.)\nEven though water vapor is more important for the natural greenhouse effect, changes in carbon dioxide have driven past\ntemperature changes. In contrast, water vapor levels in the atmosphere respond to temperature. As Earth becomes warmer, its\natmosphere can hold more water vapor, which amplifies the initial warming in a process called the \u201cwater vapor feedback.\u201d (Note:\nWest describes a feedback loop or vicious circle where warming leads to more warming.) Variations in carbon dioxide have\ntherefore been the controlling influence on past climate changes.\nSmall change, big effects\nIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising that a small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can have a big effect. We take pills that are a tiny\nfraction of our body mass and expect them to affect us. (Note: West supports his causal claim by making a comparison to\nsomething more familiar, pills.)\nToday the level of carbon dioxide is higher than at any time in human history. Scientists widely agree that Earth\u2019s average surface\ntemperature has already increased by about 2 F (1 C) since the 1880s, and that human-caused increases in carbon dioxide and other\nheat-trapping gases are extremely likely to be responsible. (Note: West points to a correlation between CO2 and temperature. Here\nhe relies on experts to support the idea of causation.)\nWithout action to control emissions, carbon dioxide might reach 0.1% of the atmosphere by 2100, more than triple the level before\nthe Industrial Revolution. This would be a faster change than transitions in Earth\u2019s past that had huge consequences. Without\naction, this little sliver of the atmosphere will cause big problems. (Note: West ends with a brief prediction. He compares the\npotential rise in carbon dioxide with past changes to imply that the consequences of human-induced climate change will be more\ndramatic than in the past.)\nAttribution\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons CC BY-ND 4.0 license.

They answer the question \"What should be done about it?\"\nIn order to build up to a proposal, an argument needs to incorporate elements of definition argument, evaluation argument, and\ncausal argument. First, we will need to define a problem or a situation that calls for action. Then we need to make an evaluation\nargument to convince readers that the problem is bad enough to be worth addressing. This will create a sense of urgency within the\nargument and inspire the audience to seek and adopt proposed action. In most cases, it will need to make causal arguments about\nthe roots of the problem and the good effects of the proposed solution.\nBelow are some elements of proposal arguments. Together, these elements can help us create a sense of urgency about the need for\naction and confidence in your proposal as a solution.\nCommon elements of proposal arguments\nBackground on the problem, opportunity, or situation\nOften just after the introduction, the background section discusses what has brought about the need for the proposal\u2014what\nproblem, what opportunity exists for improving things, what the basic situation is. For example, management of a chain of daycare\ncenters may need to ensure that all employees know CPR because of new state mandates requiring it, or an owner of pine\ntimberland in eastern Oregon may want to make sure the land can produce saleable timber without destroying the environment.\nWhile the named audience of the proposal may know the problem very well, writing the background section is useful in\ndemonstrating our particular view of the problem. If we cannot assume readers know the problem, we will need to spend more time\nconvincing them that the problem or opportunity exists and that it should be addressed. For a larger audience not familiar with the\nproblem, this section can give detailed context.\nDescription of the proposed solution\nHere we define the nature of what we are proposing so readers can see what is involved in the proposed action. For example, if\nwe write an essay proposing to donate food scraps from restaurants to pig farms, we will need to define what will be considered\nfood scraps. In another example, if we argue that organic produce is inherently healthier for consumers than non-organic produce,\nand we propose governmental subsidies to reduce the cost of organic produce, we will need to define \u201corganic\u201d and describe how\nmuch the government subsidies will be and which products or consumers will be eligible. See 7.2: Definition Arguments for\nstrategies that can help us elaborate on our proposed solution so readers can envision it clearly.\nMethods\nIf we have not already covered the proposal's methods in the description, we may want to add this. How will we go about\ncompleting the proposed work? For example, in the above example about food scraps, we would want to describe and how the\nleftover food will be stored and delivered to the pig farms. Describing the methods shows the audience we have a sound, thoughtful\napproach to the project. It serves to demonstrate that we have the knowledge of the field to complete the project.\nFeasibility of the project\nA proposal argument needs to convince readers that the project can actually be accomplished. How can enough time, money, and\nwill be found to make it happen? Have similar proposals been carried out successully in the past? For example, we might observe\nthat according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Rutgers University runs a program that sends a ton of food scraps a\nday from its dining halls to a local farm.1 If we describe how other efforts overcame obstacles, we will persuade readers that if\nthey can succeed, this proposal can as well.\n7.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/37807 Benefits of the proposal\nMost proposals discuss the advantages or benefits that will come from the solution proposed. Describing the benefits helps you win\nthe audience to your side, so readers become more invested in adopting your proposed solution. In the food scraps example, we\nmight emphasize that the Rutgers program, rather than costing more, led to $100,000 a year in savings because the dining halls no\nlonger needed to pay to have the food scraps hauled away. We could calculate the predicted savings for our new proposed program\nas well.\nIn order to predict the positive effects of the proposal and show how implementing it will lead to good results, we will want to use\ncausal arguments. The strategies in 7.5: Causal Arguments will be helpful here. This is a good time to refer back to the problem we\nidentified early in the essay and show how the proposal will resolve that original problem.\nSample annotated proposal argument\nThe sample essay \"Why We Should Open Our Borders\" by student Laurent Wenjun Jiang can serve as an example.

Nations have tried a variety of solutions, but the\nreality has not improved. Yet there exists a single easy measure that could solve almost all of the problems mentioned above: an\nopen-border policy. The current border and immigration practices, including border controls and detention centers, are unjustified\nand counterproductive. (Note: The first body paragraph gives background on the problem, opportunity, or situation.) This paper\ndiscusses the refugee problem, the history of open-border policy, the refutations for the current border policies on philosophical and\nmoral grounds, and the arguments why this open-border policy will work economically.\nRefugees are a problem of worldwide concern. Recently the biggest wave of refugees came from Syria, which witnessed an eight-\nyear-long civil war. In an interview, a Syrian refugee expresses deep sorrows regarding the loss of her home: \u201cMy brothers, sisters,\nuncles, neighbors, streets, the bread ovens, schools, children going to schools ...we miss all of that, everything in Syria is precious\nto us\u201d she says, with tears hovering in her eyes (Firpo). She also exposes the terrible living conditions there: \u201c[W]e didn\u2019t run away,\nSyria has become uninhabitable. Not even animals could live there. No power, no running water, no safety, and no security. You\ndon\u2019t know who to fight...even when you lock yourself away, you\u2019re not safe...I was most scared of seeing my children die right in\nfront of me\u201d (Firpo). (Note: Moving refugee testimonies serve as evidence supporting the claim that their situation is one of great\nurgency.) As heart-breaking as it sounds, we should also know that this is only the tip of the iceberg: Gerhard Hoffstaedter, an\nanthropologist at the University of Queensland, states that there are around 70 million displaced people in developing countries,\nwhich is the highest recorded number since the 1950s, causing the United Nations to call this world issue \u201ca crisis.\u201d The leading\nnations in the world do not offer enough support to displaced people living in abject conditions. Refugees at the U.S.-Mexico\nborder and in Southeast Asia and Australia are constantly kept in detention centers. Many nations do not comply with the\nprovisions signed in the 1951 Refugee Convention and the succeeding 1967 Protocol; they treat the refugees only as those in\npassive need of simply humanitarian aids (Hoffstaedter). In this crisis, it is our common responsibility as members of an\ninternational community to help those who are in need.\nHistorically, the large-scale control of the mobility of people is a relatively new phenomenon worldwide. (Note: This body\nparagraph starts with a definition argument to show that the current trend is new. This argument later becomes support for the idea\nthat open borders are possible.) In the modern era, border signifies \u201cever more restrictive immigration policies\u201d at the same time\ngrants \u201cgreater freedom of mobility to capital and commodities\u201d, as defined in the editorial \u201cWhy No Borders.\u201d This creates a\ncontradictory ideology that could cause potential harm to those who need to migrate (Anderson, et al.). John Maynard Keynes dates\nthe beginning of this process only back to World War I in the early 20th century. However, this trend did not become widespread\nuntil after World War II. According to a historical outline created by Christof Van Mol and Helga de Valk, due to the booming in\nthe industrial production in northwestern Europe in the 1950s, the local workers were increasingly educated and gradually became\nwhitecollar employers, leaving vacancies in blue-collar occupations (Mol and Valk).\n1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92716 Thus, those countries started recruiting immigrants from other parts of Europe and even North Africa: for example, Germany and\nFrance started seasonal working programs to attract immigrants (Mol and Valk). Because of the lack of job opportunities in the\nother parts of Europe and North Africa and the need for workers in the industrializing countries in Northern and Western Europe,\n\u201cinternational migration was generally viewed positively because of its economic benefits, from the perspective of both the sending\nand the receiving countries'' (Mol and Valk). This early migration pattern within Europe provides the basic model for the European\nUnion that builds on the fundamental ideology of the free movements of goods and human resources. In recent days, the European\nUnion has become one of the biggest multinational organizations, which can also serve as a successful example of this open-border\nideology, at least on a regional scale.\nBorders do not satisfy the needs of contemporary societies. From both philosophical and moral perspectives, restrictive border\npolicies are not justified. First of all, borders divide and subjugate people. The editorial \u201cWhy No Borders\u201d describes the border as\nbeing\u201cthoroughly ideological\u201d (Anderson, et al.). The authors argue that because border policies try to categorize people into\n\u201cdesirable and non-desirable\u201d according to their skills, race, or social status, etc., they thus create an interplay between \u201csubjects\nand subjectivities,\u201d placing people into \u201cnew types of power relationship\u201d (Anderson, et al.). This is what is identified as the\nultimate cause of the divisions and inequalities between people.\nSome fear that competition from immigrants would cause a reduction in the wages of local workers (Caplan). (Note: In this body\nparagraph, the author attempts to disprove the counterargument about a downside of open borders for local workers.)This is not an\nuncalled-for worry, but it is also a misunderstanding of the nature of the open-border policy. Nick Srnicek reasons that this kind of\ncompetition has already existed under the current trend of globalization, where workers in developed countries are already\ncompeting against those in developing countries that have cheaper labor. He argues, \u201cWorkers in rich countries are already losing,\nas companies eliminate good jobs and move their factories and offices elsewhere\u201d (Srnicek). The border serves companies by\nmaking workers in the developing world stay where wages are low. Thus, \u201ccompanies can freely exploit\u201d cheap labor. In this sense,\nworkers on both sides will be better off under an open-border policy (Srnicek). A recent study from the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison investigating the economic implications of immigration between rich and poor countries concluded that the benefits of an\nopen-border policy far outweigh the cons and that \u201cthe real wage effects are small\u201d (Kennan).\nAlthough an open border could lead to minor reductions in the wages of local workers in developed countries, there is a simple\nsolution. Since the labor market follows the economic law of supply, work supply and wages are inversely related, meaning that the\nlower the supply of labor, the more wages rise. (Note: This paragraph could be seen as a limit and a rebuttal because the open\nborder would need to be combined with changes to labor laws in order to avoid a possible bad effect.) Nick Srnicek proposes, \u201ca\nshortening of the workweek...would reduce the amount of work supplied, spread the work out more equally among everyone and\ngive more power to workers ... more free time to everyone\u201d (Srnicek). Thus, although the open-border policy is not perfect, its\ndownside is easy to address. (Note: The author does not investigate how much time, money, and will an open border policy would\nneed; the argument remains mostly theoretical because it doesn\u2019t address feasibility.)\nAs an expatriate myself, I can truly relate to this type of thinking. Due to a variety of the political, economic, and social limitations\nthat I came across in my home country, I was not able to achieve self-actualization. In pursuit of a better education and a more free\nliving environment, I went abroad and finally arrived in this country a few years ago. It was not until then that I gained a vision of\nmy future. Now I am working in hopes that one day the vision could become reality. Sometimes I cannot help wondering what\ncould happen if I was not so lucky to be where I am today. But at the same time, I am also conscious of the fact that there are also\nmillions of people out there who cannot even conceive of what it is like to actualize their lives. (Note: The conclusion humanizes\nthe possible benefits of the proposed solution.)I am sure that one of the mothers who escaped her war-torn home country with her\nfamily has the sole hope to witness her children growing up in a happy and free place, just like any mother in the world. I am sure\nthat there is one little girl whose family fled her country in desperation who once studied so hard in school, dreaming of becoming\nthe greatest scientist in the world. I am also sure that there is a young boy who survived persecutions and wishes to become a\npolitician one day to make the world a better place for the downtrodden. Because of borders, these children can only dream of the\nthings that many of us take for granted every day. We, as human beings, might be losing a great mother, great scientist, great\npolitician, or just a great person who simply wishes for a better world. But everything could be otherwise. Change requires nothing\nbut a minimal effort. With open borders, we can help people achieve their dreams.\nWorks Cited\nHoffstaedter, Gerhard. \u201cThere Are 70 Million Refugees in the World.

We have mapped out arguments and assessed their\nreasoning, evidence, and assumptions without referring to our feelings about them. And yet we all know that arguments are not\nwon and lost solely on the merits of the ideas. Humans are not robots. As Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor put it in A Rhetoric\nof Argument, emotions are \u201cpowerful incentives to belief and action.\" Philosophers and laypeople have long asked what role\nemotions should have in shaping our ideas. Is it right for arguments to appeal to emotion, or is it a cheap trick? Should we guard\nagainst feeling what an argument asks us to feel? Or should we let emotions play a role in helping us decide whether we agree or\nnot?\nPhoto by Mark Daynes on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nIn one oversimplified view, logic is a good way to decide things and listening to emotions is a bad way. We might make this\nassumption if we tell ourselves or others, \u201cStop and think. You\u2019re getting too emotional.\u201d According to this view, no one reasons\nwell under the influence of emotion. Pure ideas are king, and feelings only distort them.\nOf course, sometimes emotions do lead us astray. But emotions and logic can work together. Consider Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI\nhave a dream\u201d speech. Was it illegitimate for him to ask listeners to feel deeply moved to support racial equality? He famously\nproclaimed, \u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of\ntheir skin, but by the content of their character.\u201d Should listeners have guarded themselves against feeling sympathy for those four\nchildren? If we care about things that matter and an argument is about something that matters, then we will and should have\nfeelings about it. King intertwines his logical argument against racism with an appeal to our empathy, tenderness, and sense of\njustice.\nNot all arguments are as intense as that one. Many, such as scientific journal articles, are calm and dispassionate. But all arguments\nmust call on emotion, broadly defined, because they must motivate readers to stay engaged. Even a captive audience could\npotentially tune out. Every argument needs a reason to exist, a reason why it is important or relevant or just worth reading. It needs\nto keep us interested, or, failing that, to keep us convinced that reading on will be worthwhile. This reason to exist is sometimes\ncalled exigence. An argument can create exigence and motivate readers in many ways, but all these ways depend on emotion.\nBesides the basic human emotions we might recognize on a toddler\u2019s face--anger, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, desire, and surprise--\neach one with many options for levels of intensity, there are others that we don\u2019t always think of as emotion. If we appeal to\nreaders\u2019 self-interest, we play on fear and hope and desire for emotional, physical and economic wellbeing. Another kind of\nemotion is the desire for belonging, for a sense of being seen and validated. We feel pride in a group or sense of identity or social\nstatus, so references to that shared identity or status appeal to this sense of belonging. Our motivation to uphold our most precious\nvalues is bound up in deep feeling.\nAnother form of emotion present in the most seemingly objective arguments is curiosity. This is often combined with an appeal to a\nsense of pride in our intellectual capacity. Academic journal articles and popular newspaper and magazine articles and nonfiction\n8.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31267 books must all appeal to readers\u2019 curiosity about the world and its workings and surprises to encourage them to keep reading. An\nargument may implicitly invite us to enjoy learning and discovery. It can offer a sense of relief, comfort, and pleasure in ideas laid\nout clearly in an ordered fashion.\nPhoto by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nArguments can call on emotions in support of claims, but they can also make shaping readers\u2019 emotions their primary purpose. An\nargument may set out to define or change how a reader feels about something. Or, it may set out to reinforce emotions and amplify\nthem. A eulogy, for example, is a speech that praises a person who has passed away, a person usually already known to the\naudience. It serves to help people feel more intensely what they already believe about the value of the person's life.\nIn this chapter, we will explore how writers use examples, word choice, and tone to affect readers\u2019 feelings. We will look at how\nwriters can vary their emotional appeals in the course of an argument and adapt them to specific audiences. Finally, we will\nconsider how to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate emotional appeals, between those that fit the logic of the argument\nand those that stray from it.\nThis page titled 8.1: The Place of Emotion in Argument is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nAnna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n8.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31267 8.2: Word Choice and Connotation\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (6 min, 6 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 66::0066\nIn previous chapters, we considered argument in terms of logic. We have asked ourselves if claims, reasons, and assumptions are\ncorrect in what they assert. Now we will look at how writers choose words not only to convey ideas but to shape readers\u2019 emotional\nexperience and subconscious reactions.\nThe dreamy, glowing colored sparkles around the word \"dream\" express the sense of wonder and vague possibility associated with\nthe word.\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nConnotation refers to the emotions, social and cultural implications, and related concepts that most people associate with a word.\nSome connotations are obvious: anyone would prefer be called \u201cassertive\u201d rather than \u201cpushy\u201d for demanding something they\nconsider to be their right. Other connotations are more subtle. Consider the difference between the feelings associated with the\nwords \u201cchange\u201d and \u201ctransform.\u201d \u201cTransform\u201d has connotations of visionary change for the better. If we hear that \u201cthe new college\npresident has transformed the admissions process\u201d we are more likely to feel hopeful, perhaps impressed, without knowing\nanything at all about the nature of the changes. If we hear simply that \u201cthe new college president has changed the admissions\nprocess,\u201d we will probably feel more skeptical about these changes and what their positive and negative impacts may be.\nConsider what different feelings about journalists come across in the following two sentences:\nThe media were swarming around the pileup on the expressway to capture every\nconceivable injury for the evening news.\nThe journalists were on the scene at the expressway crash to document the incident for\nthe evening news.\nThe first sentence gives us a sense of media reporting that is inappropriately aggressive through the words \u201cswarm\u201d and \u201ccapture.\u201d\nIn the second sentence, on the other hand, \u201cwere on the scene\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d imply that the journalists are neutral, diligent, and\nprofessional.\nIf something in an argument is likely to set the reader against the argument, the writer can try to soften that reaction by choosing\nthe most positive words available to fit the meaning. If the writer wants to intensify feelings of outrage, tragedy, or absurdity\naround a phenomenon that readers might otherwise dismiss as ordinary, the writer will need to think of an unfamiliar and dramatic\nway to describe that phenomenon.\nThe border argument we analyzed in Chapters 2 and 3 offers many examples of emotional word choice. In the opening paragraph,\nthe author starts out by referring to \u201cillegal immigration,\u201d acknowledging the familiar, commonly used phrase in the question \u201cIs\nillegal immigration actually wrong?\u201d However, she quickly shifts to words with gentler connotations when she reframes the\nquestion as, \u201cIs it unethical to cross a border without permission?\u201d This is the emotional shift she is encouraging readers to make--\n8.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31268 away from harsh judgment and toward a clear-eyed understanding. As she expands her exploration of the position of the\nundocumented in the next paragraph, she describes them in sympathetic terms with the following phrases: \u201cpeople who are driven\nby need and good intentions,\u201d \u201craising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence,\u201d \u201cunder desperate\ncircumstances.\u201d The connotations and emotional appeal are very much the same as those in the poem inscribed on the Statue of\nLiberty, \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d by Emma Lazarus, 1883. Lady Liberty talks about immigrants in words full of pathos and hope:\nGive me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\nImage by Wallula from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nPractice Exercise 8.2.1\nWrite down the connotations of each of the following words used to refer to immigrants:\nundocumented immigrants\nrefugees\nasylum-seekers\nDreamers\nillegal immigrants\nillegal aliens\nDecide when or if you would use each term in discussions of current U.S. policy.\nPractice Exercise 8.2.2\n1.

To feel connected to an argument, readers need to be able to imagine what it means in some particular case.\nWriters can bring an example to life by describing a scene, developing a character, or building suspense and ending with a dramatic\nresolution.\nThe sample border argument we have referenced invites readers to imagine a hypothetical example where they themselves are\ndesperately seeking to protect a child and bring them into the United States. The argument could well be expanded by adding the\nstory of a real parent and child. One book, Solito\/Solita: Crossing Borders with Youth Refugees from Central America, edited by\nSteven Mayers and Jonathan Freedman, dedicates itself to first-person stories of asylum seekers. One of these is \u201cRosa, a\nSalvadoran mother fighting to save her life as well as her daughter\u2019s after death squads threatened her family. Together they trekked\nthrough the jungles on the border between Guatemala and Mexico, where masked men assaulted them.\u201d Another is \"Adrian, from\nGuatemala City, whose mother was shot to death before his eyes. He refused to join a gang, rode across Mexico atop cargo trains,\ncrossed the US border as a minor, and was handcuffed and thrown into ICE detention on his eighteenth birthday.\" The publisher,\nVoice of Witness, sees powerful individual stories as its best tool to affect social change. Its mission statement declares, \u201cVoice of\nWitness (VOW) advances human rights by amplifying the voices of people impacted by injustice...Our work is driven by the\ntransformative power of the story, and by a strong belief that an understanding of crucial issues is incomplete without deep\nlistening and learning from people who have experienced injustice firsthand.\u201d\nOf course, an argument calling for more controls on immigration would choose a wholly different kind of story. The following\nexcerpt from President Trump\u2019s speech accepting the nomination for the presidency in 2016 focuses on a young woman killed by\nan immigrant: \u201cThey are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public\nsafety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent\nyoung girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point\nAverage. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s beautiful family. But to\n[the Obama] Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn\u2019t worth protecting. One more child\nto sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\u201d\nObviously, there are as many stories to choose from as there are immigrants. If a story serves as an illustration of a general point,\nwe have to ask how representative it is. Is it presented as typical? If so, is there evidence to show its typicality? Arguments can\ncomplement specific examples with statistics to show typicality.\nEven if an example represents a common experience, we need to look carefully at how it is used. Does the story promote harmful\nstereotypes while neglecting accounts that are just as common or more common and that contradict those stereotypes?\nPractice Exercise 8.3.1\nReview some local headlines on news sites like NPR, Fox News, ABC, or any other news site you frequently visit, and find an\narticle or video that uses a powerful example to illustrate a point. Then, evaluate the powerful example, addressing the\nfollowing questions:\nWhat point does the powerful example illustrate?\nWhat types of emotions does the example play on? How will these emotions affect the reader's opinion on an issue\ndiscussed in the piece?\nIs the powerful example presented as typical? If so, is there evidence to show its typicality?\nDoes the powerful example promote harmful stereotypes? How so, or why not?\n8.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31269 This page titled 8.3: Powerful Examples is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n8.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31269 8.4: Tone\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (12 min):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1122::0000\nWhat is tone?\nTone refers to the overall emotional attitude of the argument. We know intuitively what \u201ctone of voice\u201d means when we\u2019re\ndescribing a conversation. If we hear a person speaking and ask ourselves the following questions, we will usually be able to\ndescribe the tone:\nWhat emotions do the sound of the voice convey?\nWhat expression do we see or imagine on the speaker's face as they make the argument?\nThis performer conveys confidence, friendliness, and humor through her smile and posture.\nPhoto by Loui G. from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nWhen we read, we lack the visual and auditory clues, but we still intuitively sense the writer's attitude. Tone comes across through\nemotional word choice and choice of examples, as we have seen in 8.2: Word Choice and Connotation and 8.3: Powerful\nExamples, but also in other ways, both subtle and overt. These include sentence structure, use of questions, emphasis, and direct\ndeclarations of feeling. All of these contribute to an overall pattern.\nFor example, let's look at the border argument we analyzed in Chapters 2 and 3. The third paragraph reads as follows:\nI don\u2019t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put\nour security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and\ngood intentions.\nIn 8.2: Word Choice and Connotation, we noted that words like \"driven by need\" and \"good intentions\" evoke feelings of\ncompassion and sympathy. In describing the tone, however, we could go further to talk about the writer's purpose and attitude.\nTheir admissions of uncertainty in the first sentence indicate an attitude of humility and openness, so we could describe the tone as\n\"humble.\" In the second sentence, the word \"surely\" suggests urgency and an appeal to common sense. The contrast between the\norderly, neutral phrase \"regulate the border\" and the more aggressive-sounding \"criminalizing people\" suggests that one option is\ndecent and the other cruel. The feelings of compassion and sympathy evoked by people's \"need\" and \"good intentions\" reinforce\nthe sense of urgency and appeal to decency. The combination of all of this suggests that the writer cares very much about the ethics\n8.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31270 of what they are discussing because innocent people's wellbeing is at stake. We could describe the tone, then, as \"earnest,\"\n\"urgent,\" or \"impassioned.\"\nHow can we identify a writer's tone?\nIf we want to describe the tone of an argument, we can ask ourselves these general questions:\nHow does the writer feel about the topic of the argument?\nHow does the writer feel about their own knowledge of the topic?\nWhat is the writer's attitude toward the reader?\nIf we are not sure how to answer or we want more insight, we can consider specific aspects of the writer's attitude, such as the\ndegree of respect, seriousness, or certainty they feel. To describe the tone very precisely, we will need to use multiple words. We\ncan ask ourselves about each of the aspects of tone listed in the table below and consider which of the accompanying tone words\nbest describe the argument we are analyzing. Note that words clustered together are in most cases not synonyms. They convey\nshades of meaning, so they are worth looking up in an online dictionary to confirm their connotations before using them.\nLike colors grouped next to similar colors, related tone words may describe similar but slightly different tones.

The writer may be\nshifting tone and emotional appeal in subtle or dramatic ways either to match shifts in the ideas or to create variety. If we think of\nargument in terms of relationship and intimate conversation, this idea becomes clearer. One style when we talk to another person is\nto stick with one tone and repeat an emotional appeal over and over. This can be successful in reinforcing the message and perhaps\nwearing down resistance, but it can also be offputting. It could even seem robotic, unresponsive to the reader\u2019s needs. A more\nflexible, varied tone with moments of greater and lesser intensity can provide contrast and relief and thus seem more sensitive to\nthe audience. Thus, sometimes even in serious, earnest arguments, it can help keep readers from tuning out if the writer lightens the\ntone or takes a step back.\nWe think of Shakespearean drama as exalted high culture, but Shakespeare famously wrote scenes of terrible puns, sex jokes, and\nplenty of slapstick into his most intense tragedies to keep the audience from pelting actors with rotten tomatoes. Similarly, a writer\nmay choose to offer some relief or distraction after an impassioned appeal through a moment of humor or a neutral statement.\nLike music, an argument can shift in tone and pacing to engage listeners.\nPhoto by Pixabay from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nWe can think of variety in emotional appeal as similar to the way music varies in volume and pacing. Sometimes a piece of music\nkeeps the same volume and pace throughout, but more often the composer adds notes to the musician on when to boom or hush,\nhurry or draw out the notes. Often the music gets faster and louder toward the end, in a crescendo of intensity. This is one\ntraditional way of ending an argument: on what we sometimes call a \u201cringing note\u201d meant to inspire and fire up readers to agree,\nremember, or take action.\nPractice Exercise 8.5.1\nChoose a Ted talk that includes a transcript, such as Jamila Lysicott\u2019s \u201c3 ways to speak English.\u201d Watch the talk and then read\nthe transcript, making notes on the tone in the margins.

Values, cultural beliefs, and life experiences shape our emotional reactions. While some appeals to our\nfeelings, such as the reference to parents\u2019 desire to protect their children, may be more universal, others will be more audience\nspecific. Different readers can have opposite emotional reactions to the same sentence. When the writer misjudges readers\u2019 values,\nassumptions or experiences, an emotional appeal may fall flat or may hurt the argument instead of helping. An obvious example is\na racist or sexist comment.\nThe speaker here seems attentive to the emotional reactions of her audience.\nPhoto by RF._.studio from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nIn the case of the border argument, the intended audience seems to be Americans who are citizens or legal residents. What if the\nwriter knew more about how the person\u2019s life experience might relate to the issue of illegal immigration? For example, how might\nAnna Mills shape the argument and appeal to emotions differently if she knew the reader was one of the following?\nA person whose parents are undocumented\nA person who waited seven years for a visa to come to the U.S.\nA person who has been raised to be afraid of Mexican immigrants\nIn the case of the person whose parents are undocumented, the writer might actually spend less time encouraging readers to feel\nempathy. She could choose not to waste time \u201cpreaching to the choir\u201d and instead focus on policy suggestions.\nIn the case of the person who waited for the visa, she might need to find a way to overcome some resentment against people who\ncame to America without waiting so long.\nIn the case of the person raised to be afraid of Mexican immigrants, she might focus on specific immigrant stories so the reader\nwould begin to have some vivid, moving stories of real people in their minds rather than racist stereotypes.\nPractice Exercise 8.6.1\nFor each argument, consider how you would persuade the two different audiences without misleading them.\n8.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31272 Here's a sample claim: \"Police should wear body cameras.\"\nWe could write this version for an audience of police: \"Body cameras seem unnecessary, and they make moving around more\ndifficult, but hard-working police should relish the opportunity to make their actions viewable.

But there is a reason emotional\nappeals have a dubious reputation: they are often abused. If a writer knows there is a problem with the logic, they may use an\nemotional appeal to distract from the problem. Or, a writer may create a problem with the logic, knowingly or unknowingly,\nbecause they cannot resist including a particular strong emotional appeal. In Chapter 4, we looked at fallacies, or problems with\narguments\u2019 logic. Many of the fallacies we have already looked at are so common because the illogical form of the argument makes\na powerful appeal. The writer chose the faulty reasoning because they thought it would affect readers emotionally. Arguments that\nfocus on a \u201cred herring,\u201d for example, distract from the real issue to focus on something juicier. A straw man argument offers a\ndistorted version of the other side to make the other side seem frighteningly extreme.\nTo be legitimate, emotional appeals need to be associated with logical reasoning. Otherwise, they are an unfair tactic. The emotions\nshould be attached to ideas that logically support the argument. Writers are responsible for thinking through their intuitive appeals\nto emotion to make sure that they are consistent with their claims.\nPhoto by Nick Youngson of Alpha Stock Images, licensed CC BY-SA 3.0.\nEmotional appeals should not mislead readers about the true nature or the true gravity of an issue. If an argument uses a mild word\nto describe something horrific, that means the argument can\u2019t connect its emotional appeal to any logical justification. A\neuphemism is a substitute neutral-sounding word used to forestall negative reactions. For example, calling a Nazi concentration\ncamp like Auschwitz a \u201cdetention center\u201d would certainly be an unjustifiable euphemism. Given the amount of evidence about\nwhat went on at Auschwitz, using the phrase \u201cDeath Camp\u201d would be a legitimate emotional appeal.\nA more controversial question is what to call the places where people are detained if they are caught trying to cross the U.S. border\nwithout permission. An argument calling U.S. Customs and Border Patrol detention centers to \u201cconcentration camps\u201d would need\nto justify its comparison by arguing for significant similarities. Otherwise, critics would claim that the comparison was a cheap shot\nintended to make people horrified by detention centers without good reason. Even if the argument simply called the centers\n\u201ccamps,\u201d the word would still bring to mind Nazi concentration camps and also the Japanese internment camps created by our own\ngovernment during World War II. The word \u201ccamp,\u201d when referring to a place where people are held against their will, has\ninevitable overtones of racism and genocide. An argument should only choose a word with connotations that it can stand by and\nexplain.\nA question like this about whether an emotional appeal is legitimate or not often is often at the heart of any disagreement or\nproductive discussion of the argument. If we agree that the comparison to concentration camps is legitimate, we will certainly agree\nthat the detention centers, as they are currently organized, should be done away with.\n8.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31273 Practice Exercise 8.7.1\nRead each argument below and describe the emotional appeal it makes.

Now we can back up and look at readers' responses through a different lens: that of trust.\nTrust provides an underlying foundation for the success of emotional and logical appeals. If we don't have a certain degree of trust\nin the writer, we will be less willing to let an argument affect us. We may not allow even a skillfully worded emotional appeal to\nmove us, and we may not be ready to agree even with a well-supported claim.\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nHow does a writer build trust if they never come face to face with the reader? This chapter will look at various approaches to\ncreating trust in written argument, including establishing the writer's authority on the subject, convincing readers of the writer's\nmoral character, showing respect and goodwill, and creating a sense of closeness or shared identity. To understand each of these\napproaches to trust, it will help to think of an argument not as words blared through a loudspeaker into the void, but as an offering\nwithin the context of a relationship. Even as the writer explains their ideas, they are also consciously or unconsciously implying a\nparticular relation between reader and writer.\nWhat do I mean by relationship here? Each relationship implies expected ways people interact, and it often involves a shared\nidentity, whether a family connection, an ethnic similarity, a job they need to complete together, or a situation they are concerned\nin. A relationship can be casual or formal, intimate or distanced. The writer draws the reader close, beckons the reader to their side,\nor holds the reader at arm's length. They choose a style typical of the role they imagine, whether of a friend, confidante, preacher,\ndoctor, or expert. The way they address us affects how we warm to their words. When we analyze an argument, we can ask\nourselves what kind of roles and interactions the words imply. Is the writer talking to us as if we were buddies? As if we were\nstudents in a lecture hall? As if we were spiritual followers? As if we were professional colleagues working together? Or as if we\nwere the jury at a trial?\nImage by Harish Sharma from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nFocusing on trust and relationship allows us to see how nuanced argument can be and how varied its effects on different readers.\nAn argument is not an equation. Not only does it affect our emotions, but, like a movie, a song, a novel, or a poem, it invites us into\na lived experience. If we accept, we grapple with ideas in an imagined encounter with another human being.\nThis page titled 9.1: An Argument Implies a Relationship is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nAnna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n9.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/31365 9.2: Authority\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (7 min, 15 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 77::1155\nOne kind of relationship of trust is between a person who is an authority on the subject and a person who is less of an authority.\nThe writer relates to us as a teacher and we defer to their greater knowledge. So the most common and ready way to establish trust\nis to make sure readers know what makes the writer an authority on the subject at hand. Here are some messages that writers send,\neither explicitly or implicitly, to readers about why they should be regarded as authorities. This kind of trust depends on the\nqualifications of the writer rather than on the style of writing. It is sometimes called extrinsic ethos.\n\"I am a recognized expert\"\nHow can a writer convince us that they are an expert on a topic? In general, they need to show that experts in their field have\nrecognized some level of competence or leadership in them. Different topics require different forms of expertise. If the topic fits\nwithin a particular academic field, the writer can refer to their degree and to the college, university, or think tank where they do\nresearch. The reputation of the institution they are affiliated with will affect their reputation as an expert. Readers will expect a\nhigher level of expertise from a Yale professor, for example, then from a state college professor. Sometimes specific departments\ndevelop reputations for excellence, however. For example, those familiar with the field will know that the University of Michigan\nhas a top sociology department.\nAny work the person has produced can also serve as evidence. Publishing a book on a topic lends credibility, but if the writer can\npoint to positive reviews of the book, robust sales, and examples where other experts have cited the book, so much the better.\nNewspaper and magazine articles will gain credibility from the reputation of the newspaper or magazine. We can assume that the\nNew York Times and the Wall Street Journal have high standards and make sure that their articles represent expert knowledge.\nIf the topic requires professional expertise, the writer will want to point to job experience, title, role in any professional\nassociations, and any professional awards or certifications. For example, a lawyer must pass a bar examination to be allowed to\npractice law, so identifying a person as a lawyer implies a certain level of expertise. If the lawyer works for a firm that is well\nknown in its specific area of law, naming that firm will boost the lawyer's credibility further. Of course, a partner at a prestigious\nfirm will have much more credibility than an intern.\n\"Eastern Sociological Association 2020 Philadelphia\" by Beverly Yuen Thompson on Flickr is licensed CC BY-NC 2.0.\nIf the writer has a public reputation as an expert above and beyond the items that could be listed on a resume, they can provide\nevidence of that reputation in the form of praise from other experts, number of times their work has been cited, radio or television\nshows where they have been interviewed, or any other sign of public recognition of expertise.\nIf we want to prove or assess the level of expertise of a writer, we may want to review the following list:\nDegrees earned\n9.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32371 Institutional affiliation\nJob title\nJob rank\nJob experience\nAwards\nPublications\nPublic reputation\nTo be relevant, of course, all of these need to be related to the topic of the argument at hand. Dr. Phil McGraw, for example, has a\nPh.D. in clinical psychology and has focused his career on mental health. He is not medically trained. Readers should only appeal\nto him as an expert on psychological matters.\n\"I have personal experience\"\nWe are all authorities on our own experiences, feelings, and values. If something in our experience is relevant to our topic, we can\nspeak with authority even without expertise. Using \"I,\" also called speaking in the first person, can allow a writer to speak honestly\nand with conviction to further an argument. Maybe a story from our lives illustrates a larger point we want to make. Or maybe an\nemotional reaction to something becomes part of our argument. The sample argument about immigration which we analyzed earlier\ndescribes what the writer herself would do if she were in a desperate situation in another country and needed to flee in order to\nprotect her children. Even though she has no experience of immigration, she can be considered an authority on her own sense of\nmorality. Thus, the claim that she would feel justified in crossing illegally is hard to refute. From this starting point, she launches\ninto a broader argument, claiming that others would feel the same way and that therefore, Americans need to rethink how they\ncriminalize undocumented immigrants.\nSometimes the authority of personal experience is combined with the authority of power. This allows the CEO of a company or the\ndirector of a nonprofit or the president of a country to use the pronoun \"we\" to speak for their group. Thus, David Drummond,\nGoogle's senior vice-president for corporate development and chief legal officer, can title an opinion piece, \"Google: We will bring\nbooks back to life.\" In the same Guardian opinion piece published in February, 2010, he supports a legal settlement to make\ncopyrighted books available online, arguing that, \"We at Google could make that wealth of knowledge available at a click. And\nauthors would earn too.\"\n\u201cI\u2019ve done my research\u201d\nWhen a writer has no particular qualification in relation to the subject, they can still establish a certain degree of authority by citing\nauthoritative sources. The essence of a journalist or a science writer's job, for example, is to find and present authoritative sources.\nIn academic research papers, we want readers to see that we have done due diligence and can represent a range of authorities on the\nsubject. We can build credibility by describing for readers what kind of expertise each source has. MLA and APA in-text citations\nand Works Cited pages are designed to help us showcase our authoritative sources and allow readers to check up on them.\nPractice Exercise 9.2.1\nUse a popular search engine like Google to find an article about a controversial topic. Then, investigate the source of the\ninformation, such as the author, organization, or institution that published it. Consider the following questions:\nIs the source of information an authority in the topic they discuss?\nWhere does the source gain their authority (i.e. by being recognized experts, by having relevant personal experience, or by\ndoing research)?\nPractice Exercise 9.2.2\nDo a quick brainstorm about your life\u2019s experiences, education, and personal interests. Then, with a pair or small group,\ndescribe some areas you have authority in, and explain if you got that authority by being a recognized expert, by having\nrelevant personal experience, or by doing research.\nThis page titled 9.2: Authority is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills (ASCCC Open\nEducational Resources Initiative) .\n9.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32371 9.3: Distance and Intimacy\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (9 min, 13 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 99::1133\nTrust through Distance and Formality\nOften when we think of an \"authoritative style,\" we think of someone who speaks impersonally and with confidence, describing\nhow some aspect of reality works without involving their own or the reader with \"I,\" \"you\" or \"we.\" This approach to earning the\nreader's trust is all about setting aside the personal to pursue objective, neutral, unbiased pronouncements. It requires the writer to\nstep back from their own personality and feelings to ally their speech with impersonal truth.\nA formal style indicates that the writer takes seriously the institution they are speaking for and the rigorous expectations of\nargument. Traditionally, academic writing is expected to be relatively formal and distanced.\nThink of a judge in black robes presiding over a courtroom. The judge is there as an official, not a private individual, and what they\nsay is understood to represent the rule of law, not their personal opinion. When they speak, they use formal language and usually\ndescribe events impersonally. As a representative of the law, they represent the government and the interests of the people as a\nwhole.\n\"Hennepin County Judge Tanya Bransford\" by Tony Webster on Flickr, licensed CC BY-NC 2.0.\nThink also of a professor asked to speak on a news program about their area of expertise. Despite a climate scientist's degrees and\ninstitutional affiliation, we may not trust their personal musings about the future of humanity while flying over melting Greenland\nice. Their impersonal style of speech and their focus on facts about climate, reassure us that what they tell us is unbiased, objective,\nneutral, and vested with all the authority of academic rigor. If they use \"we\" it will be to refer to their academic colleagues, as in\n\"As climate scientists, we look at overall trends rather than specific snowstorms or heat waves.\" We will expect the scientist to\nspeak in definite, precise language and to speak with a certain dignity and seriousness.\nFormality and distance have their disadvantages as well as their advantages. They can make the argument seem objective and solid,\nbut they can also alienate the reader. After all, distance means we are being pushed away. Our trust in a formal argument depends\non our trust in the institutions it represents, like the government or academia. The reader may be disillusioned with these\ninstitutions or may never have trusted them in the first place. The reader may not believe that the topic calls for neutrality. We may\nwonder, too, what personal opinions and experiences and feelings the writer is hiding behind a mask of neutrality.\nTrust through Intimacy and Informality\nOver the last few decades, academia has become less wedded to the idea of objectivity and formality. In the humanities, as we have\nquestioned the history of deferring to the white European male voice and considering it universal, many have questioned whether\nany observer can be objective. Even in physics, the discovery of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal introduced the idea that the\nobserver affects the phenomenon observed and is not separate from it.\n9.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32463 An alternate approach to trust involves connection rather than distance. We relate to the writer as to a friend or loved one rather\nthan an authority figure. The writer reveals their humanity and particular responses. A sense that the writer is being open with us\nand inviting us into an intimate conversation leads to trust.\nPhoto by Jessica Da Rosa on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nAn argument could be both intimate and formal, like a marriage vow, but that combination is rare. Usually the more comfortable\nwe are and the more we share about ourselves in an argument, the less formal the style. Conversely, the less formal the style, the\nfriendlier and more connected the argument usually feels. Of course, for this approach to work, the writer has to make the intimate\nconversation seem appealing and convince us they are genuine in their openness. The writer's approach and knowledge of how the\nreader will likely respond are key here. An informal and intimate approach can backfire if it comes across as presumptuous or\ninvasive. The reader may be uncomfortable with the degree of closeness presumed.\nSo how does a writer create a sense of intimacy with a reader they will probably never meet? The more the argument can follow the\nstyle of a close conversation, the more readers may consciously or unconsciously go along with that feeling. Using an informal\nstyle will often help. That might look like casual language, the use of humor, some simpler or abbreviated sentence structure or\noccasional questions interjected. The most direct and obvious way to create the feeling of a conversation, however, is to declare it\nto the reader by using the \"I,\" the \"we\" or the \"you\" instead of an impersonal voice.\nThe \"I\" of personal experience\nMany of us have heard the advice that academic arguments should never use \u201cI.\u201d In fact, many arguments in academic journals\nnowadays do use \u201cI\u201d on occasion, especially in introductions and conclusions. They use it judiciously when the personal experience\nof the writer is relevant to the argument. In addition to offering an emotional connection, personal anecdotes give readers a sense\nthat the author is a person who is reaching out to us as people.\nThe ordinary 'I'\nUsing the first person \"I\" to talk about an experience that many people share can create a folksy sense of the author as a humble,\nordinary person we can relate to. We might think that drawing attention to the writer's ordinariness would undermine credibility. Of\ncourse, if we are looking to find out how black holes work, we know we need to turn to an expert. But if the topic is less technical\nand closer to everyday life, we may trust someone down to earth and easy to relate to more than we trust a distant authority figure.\nThe attention-getting \u201cyou\u201d\nWhen we use 'you' we are demanding the reader's attention. We can think of it as taking the reader by the hand, tapping them on the\nshoulder, or grabbing their collar, depending on how forceful the tone is. Papers written for college classes can use \u201cyou\u201d on\noccasion, especially to command the reader\u2019s attention in an introduction or a conclusion.\nThe 'we' that unites reader and writer\nA writer may use 'we' to convey that they are not only in conversation with the reader other but on the same side or in the same\nboat. This approach is often combined with a reference to a shared identity, an appeal we will explore in the next section. It can\nalso be used, however, to speak more generally about the writer and readers as fellow humans, as in the sentence, \"We often forget\nthat our parents were ever new to parenting.\"\n9.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32463 Practice Exercise 9.3.1\nRead the two student paragraphs below and reflect on the following questions:\n\u25cf What parts help you to relate to the writer as a friend?\n\u25cf What words or phrases show that the writer is being open with you?\n\u25cf What words or phrases make this feel like a conversation?\n\u25cf Which of these two paragraphs creates more trust through intimacy overall?\nRewrite one or more sentences in each paragraph to help create more trust through intimacy.\nParagraph 1:\nDue to a recent pandemic, the whole world is experiencing something that has never been experienced in all of history. In order\nto prevent the spread of a very contagious disease, the whole world decided to go on lockdown. Now a worldwide lockdown\nhas never happened before, and it has led to an interesting experience that is greatly changing a lot of lives. This virus causes\nmany interesting results when studying human behavior. However, these results are also negative, which scares people when\nthinking of the possible economic recession. This paper will mainly cover how this pandemic affects crime rates. With\neveryone locked inside, it could lead to an increase in crime with fewer witnesses out. However, with fewer people to mug and\nnot being able to go outside for no reason, this pandemic could also lead to a decrease in the current crime rate. In order to see\nhow crime has been affected by the pandemic, it is necessary to analyze crime before and after the lockdown.\nParagraph 2:\nWe generate so much hate in this world. We seem to show more hate than love to each other. We put others down. We\ndiscriminate. We judge. We persecute. We hurt those who we see differently. We act before we think. Why do we hate? Hate is\nsuch a powerful word. We have all seen or experienced acts of hate occur within our lives. Whether it\u2019s the terrorism we see on\nthe news, or the bullying in our schools, it is extremely prevalent in every sector of our lives. The world would be a much\nbetter place if we had more empathy towards each other. Although hate and empathy can be very broad subjects, I want to\nfocus on how giving to others can lead to less unhappiness and instead more empathy.To figure this out, we need to define\nwhat empathy truly means. We need to find the motives behind empathetic people, and then compare them with those who are\nhateful. We can study their respective motives and learn how to shift them.\nThis page titled 9.3: Distance and Intimacy is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n9.3.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32463 9.4: Shared Sense of Identity\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nPage ID\nListen to an audio version of this page (6 min, 14 sec):\n32464\n00::0000 \/\/ 66::1144\nOne way to create sense of connection and trust is to point to an identity that writer and reader share. If emotions are bound up in\nthat identity, this can be a powerful way to gain trust and to encourage readers to care about the argument. As Jeanne Fahnestock\nand Marie Secor put it in A Rhetoric of Argument, \"Audience members find themselves looking into a mirror, hearing their own\ninterests and beliefs expressed powerfully--or perhaps they hear interests and beliefs they did not know they had until they heard\nthem expressed by their representative.\"\nPhoto by Chona Kasinger for Disabled and Here is licensed CC BY 4.0.\nTo signal this appeal to a shared identity, writers simply name the group, as in the phrase \"My fellow Americans.\" They may switch\nto an accent or specific vocabulary used by the group, a practice called \"code switching.\" Listeners, of course, will be deciding for\nthemselves whether the switch feels authentic. In April 2019, Representative Alejandra Ocasio-Cortez was accused of using\n\"verbal blackface\" because of the way she switched style at a dinner for the National Action Network led by prominent black\nleader Reverend Al Sharpton. As The Atlantic put it, she \"sprinkled some elements of Black English into her speech.\" The Atlantic\ndescribes it thus: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a bartender. Ain\u2019t nothing wrong with that,\u201d she said, also stretching \u201cwrong\u201d out a bit and\nintoning in a way sometimes referred to as a \u201cdrawl,\u201d but which is also part of the Black English tool kit.\" The Atlantic defended\nher speech as authentic. They explained that \"since the 1950s, long-term and intense contact between black and Latino people in\nurban neighborhoods has created a large overlap between Black English and, for example, \u201cNuyorican\u201d English, the dialect of New\nYork\u2019s Puerto Rican community. To a considerable extent, Latinos now speak \u201cEbonics\u201d just as black people do, using the same\nslang and constructions.\"\nEven if the group identity in question is not an emotionally charged one, referring to it can help readers feel connected to the writer\nand the argument. For example, an argument might begin, \"Those of us who drink fluoridated water every day reap many health\nbenefits, whether we know it or not.\" Such a reference brings the particular identity to the forefront of the reader\u2019s mind.\nSometimes writers feel that the most powerful thing they have in common with readers is opposition to a group rather than\nmembership in a group. They can try to get readers on their side by focusing on a group they presume the reader does not or will\nnot want to belong to. Defining that group negatively becomes the basis for unity and trust between writer and reader.\n9.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32464 Of course, any negative characterization of a group raises ethical questions. Is the negative assessment justifiable? Is it expressed in\na disrespectful or dehumanizing way? Does its use inflame divisions within society in a way that has harmful side effects? Apart\nfrom the question of whether or not referring to another group is right in a specific case, writers should also be aware of ways in\nwhich negative references can undermine trust, especially if the audience ends up being broader than the writer initially envisioned.\nSometimes putting the opposition in a group can backfire and hurt an argument more than it help. Here are two controversial\nexamples:\nIn 2016 when Hillary Clinton referred to some Donald Trump supporters as \"a basket of deplorables,\" she was not just\ncriticizing their ideas but trying to make them seem other, a group no one would want to belong to. She used the phrase in a\nspeech at an LGBT fundraising event, but news of it quickly went viral. In response, Trump declared to his supporters, \"While\nmy opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country.\"\nHis campaign printed shirts that read \"Proud to be a deplorable.\" Clinton apologized for her remark soon after, but many\nconsidered that she had done irretrievable damage. In her 2017 book What Happened, she reflected that the comment probably\ncontributed to her loss in the election.\nThe phrase \"OK Boomer,\" used to express Generation Z's frustration with baby boomers who seem stuck in their thinking, has\nbeen criticized as dismissive. The New York Times declared in October 2019 that \"\u2018OK Boomer\u2019 Marks the End of Friendly\nGenerational Relations.\"\nPractice Exercise 9.4.1\nLook up a recent speech by a politician you admire or detest. (Try a search on \"Biden speech\" or \"Trump speech.\") What\nappeals to shared identity does the speech make? What assumptions about the audience does it reveal?\nPractice Exercise 9.4.2\n1. In a small group, find an identity unrelated to school that you share with your group members. You might consider the\nfollowing questions:\nDo you all have a sports team you like or sport you all enjoy?\nDo you share a culture, ethnicity, country of origin, or place you grew up?\nDo you have a language in common in addition to English?\nWhat kinds of additional responsibilities do you have besides school?\nNow, come up with an argument that you can aim specifically at members of the group you all belong to. See the example\nbelow.\nSample shared identity: musician\nSample controversial topic: free college\nShared identity paragraph: My fellow drummers, bassists, pianists, guitarists, and anyone else who loves to create new\nand exciting sounds, I am addressing you today to bring up the topic of free college, which we are totally for. Free college\nis better than playing the main stage at The House of Blues, and let me tell you why: it benefits the economy and provides\nsupport for low-income students. How many of us want to spend money on college instead of new guitar strings? Yeah,\nthat\u2019s what I thought. Not to mention we are rarely paid for our work, so free college is the best way to get a new career;\nyou know, in case this whole rockstar thing doesn\u2019t work out.\nThis page titled 9.4: Shared Sense of Identity is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n9.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32464 9.5: Respect and Goodwill\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nPage ID\nListen to an audio version of this page (6 min, 18 sec):\n32465\n00::0000 \/\/ 66::1188\nWe don\u2019t tend to trust people who don\u2019t respect us and don\u2019t wish us well. Regardless of how formal or informal or how intimate or\ndistanced the argument is, if the reader feels the writer is disrespectful and doesn\u2019t care about the reader\u2019s perspective or\nexperience, the reader will lose trust.\nConversely, if the reader feels that the writer understands the reader's perspective and uses that understanding to make the\nexperience of reading the argument as straightforward and intellectually pleasant as possible, the reader will trust the writer more.\nGoodwill and respect distinguish a good argument from a rant which gives vent to the arguer\u2019s feelings while ignoring what readers\nmight need.\nPhoto by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nHere are a few concrete actions writers can take to show goodwill and respect toward readers:\nExpress ideas in a clear and straightforward way. Making things clear often takes a lot of mental sweat. Readers generally do\nnot appreciate having to do the work of sorting out unnecessarily convoluted sentences.\nGuide readers through the ideas with clear transitions. Showing how each part of the essay relates to the next also takes mental\nsweat on the part of the writer. Readers will appreciate not being left dangling at the end of one paragraph, trying to figure out\nwhy the writer switches topics in the next and how the two topics are connected.\nTell the reader what to expect from the structure of the argument. If there will be several parts to the argument, readers may feel\nsupported when the writer offers a clear map of what is coming. An example might be \"I will first describe how neurons carry\nmessages from the brain to other parts of the body before I explain how those messaging pathways can be disrupted in\nneurological disorders.\" Telling the readers what the writer plans to do in first person is also called the \u201cI\u201d of method because\nthe \"I\" is used not to describe personal experience but to describe the writer's methods in the text itself. If there is more than one\nwriter, as in scientific papers, of course, this would become the \"we\" of method. Of course, too much description of what the\nwriter is planning to do can become boring and can get in the way of the momentum of the argument.\nAnticipate and answer likely questions. This shows respect because the writer is giving the reader credit in advance for\nintelligence, curiosity, and critical thinking. One way to do this is to refer to the reader directly as \u201cyou,\u201d as in \u201cyou may well\n9.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32465 ask.\u201d It can also be done in third person, as in the phrases \"some will wonder\" and \"this raises the question of....\"\nCorrect misconceptions respectfully. If a writer is frustrated with popular misconceptions on a topic, they should give the reader\nthe benefit of the doubt and politely assume that such daft misconceptions belong to others. We can refer to those who hold the\nmisconception in the third person in a phrase like \"some may assume that\" rather than targeting the reader with a \"you may be\nassuming that...\"\nPractice Exercise 9.5.1\n1. Read the paragraphs below and reflect on the strategies the writer used to show respect and goodwill.\nAre there parts that are expressed clearly? Are there others that can be revised for clarity?\nAre there enough transitions to guide you?\nAre there any questions that show that the author gives the reader credit for intelligence, curiosity, or critical thinking?\nIs there a question that they could add?\n2. Revise one of the paragraphs to show more respect and goodwill.\nParagraph 1\nThere have been many theories about the idea of nature in mental health. Many researchers have begun to investigate\ncertain theories that focus on the correlation between our cognitive processes and the natural world. The most recognized\ntheories are the Attention Restoration Theory (ART), the Stress Reduction Theory (SRT), and specific preferences for\nnature. The Attention Restoration Theory (ART), developed and popularized by Stephen and Rachel Kaplan, professors of\npsychology at the University of Michigan, proposes that exposure to nature can help us improve our ability to concentrate\nas well as reduce the stress through the automatic generation of physiologic responses. This can be attributed to the more\nrelaxed sensation people may have when exposed to a natural environment. Stephen and Rachel Kaplan also proposed that\nthere are four cognitive states on the way to restoration, which include a clearer head\/concentration, mental fatigue\nrecovery, soft fascination\/interest, and reflection and restoration. In the first stage, thoughts, worries, and concerns are\npassed through the mind and are simply flowing through the mind naturally. During the second stage, restoration begins as\nthe directed attention recovers and is restored. The third stage is focused on distracting the individual as they become\nengaged in low restoring activities, giving them time and space to calm down. Lastly, as a result of spending time in this\nenvironment, the individual can feel like they can relax and reflect on themselves and their goals. This is the most essential\npart of the restorative stage.\nParagraph 2\nOne factor that social media primarily affects are sleep patterns. A study concluded that 37% of 268 young adolescents\nconfirmed that increased internet use is associated with shorter sleep duration, later bedtimes and rise times, longer sleep\nlatencies, and increased daytime tiredness (Woods 1). Sleep in a teenager\u2019s life is one of the utmost important factors to\nhealthy development. According to Better Health, sleep deprivation can cause an unhealthy mental state that can lead to\ndepression, aggression, low self-esteem, reduced physical and academic performance, and poor decision making. This leads\nto a vicious cycle: the cell phone causes sleep deprivation, which then causes mental health issues, which are confronted\nwith more cell phone use. This is problematic because they distract themselves with their devices and don\u2019t realize they\nneed professional help.\nThis page titled 9.5: Respect and Goodwill is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n9.5.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32465 9.6: Moral Character\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (7 min, 7 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 77::0077\nA part of our trust in a writer or in another person in any relationship is based on our perception of their moral character. Do they\nshare the values we find most important? The word \"character\" has connotations of both firmness and fairness. A person with\ncharacter stands up for their beliefs and is principled rather than self-interested. Note that there is some overlap between the trust\nappeal discussed in Section 9.5: Respect and Goodwill and a trust appeal through good moral character. A basic element of good\nmoral character is wishing others well, not ill.\nJust as people signal their moral character in how we present ourselves, writers can signal moral character through their writing\nchoices.\nPhoto by Liza Summer from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nFamous basketball coach John Wooden declared that \u201cThe true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching.\u201d\nStill, as humans, we constantly watch each other and assess each other's character. A writer can seek to gain the reader's trust by\ndrawing attention to their moral character either directly or indirectly. In a direct appeal, a writer might describe their values, tell\nstories that illustrate their past moral actions, mention their reputation for good character, or refer readers to others who can vouch\nfor them.\nIf a writer anticipates that some will question their character, they can present disclaimers, or rejections of others' likely\nmisconceptions. Imagine an argument that starts by asking how Robin Hood might be a relevant hero for today's America. The\nwriter would quickly need to clarify that they are not condoning stealing: \"I would never argue that we should actually steal from\nthe rich as Robin Hood did.\" Such a disclaimer is usually followed by a clarification of their position which highlights their good\ncharacter: \"I do think that the character of Robin Hood is an inspiration for today's advocates of a wealth tax to fund education and\ncombat rising inequality.\"\nDirect references to a writer's moral character run the risk of coming across as arrogant or presumptuous. More common and\narguably more effective are indirect attempts to demonstrate moral character in the way a writer makes their argument. As Jeanne\nFahnestock and Marie Secor write in A Rhetoric of Argument, \"We all know that character shows in what we say and do. It is\nequally obvious in what we write.\" Honesty and reasonableness are two aspects of character that are especially crucial to\ndemonstrate in argument.\n9.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32466 Honesty\nAbraham Lincoln was known in his day and after as \"Honest Abe.\" His reputation as such, along with his accomplishments,\nformed the core of his image as an American hero. Probably nothing is more important to establishing trust than truthfulness and\nopenness.\nEven lies of omission can undermine trust. As readers, we want to believe that the writer is giving us a fair overview of what they\nknow. If a writer fails to mention something relevant that makes them look bad, readers may well hear it from an opponent and\nconsider the writer to have wrongly concealed it. Acknowledging points that actually hurt the writer's argument can help to\ndemonstrate openness and honesty. This includes a writer's motivations, even those that involve self-interest. This may involve a\ndisclaimer like the following: \"It is true that I have an interest in maintaining high enrollment at our community college, since my\njob depends on it. But I do not think that is my main motivation for supporting the push to expand our offerings. I believe that the\ncommunity will benefit when we have greater community participation in adult education.\"\nAnother aspect of honesty is emotional honesty--the writer's sincerity about the values and feelings expressed. If the writer has\nmade an emotional appeal or an appeal to shared values, we as readers need to believe that the appeal represents the writer's\nauthentic feelings and values. If we feel we are being manipulated, we will likely recoil and resist both the emotions and the logic\nof the argument. How can we tell if a writer is sincere or not? There is no formula for this, just as there is no formula when we meet\nsomeone or listen to a speech and decide if the person is sincere. Readers' intuitions will be shaped by subtleties of word choice and\ncultural expectations. One highly dramatic emotional appeal or declaration of values may come across as exaggerated, and another\nmay come across as an earnest expression of the writer's strong convictions. In my own opinion, the best way for writers to create\nan impression of sincerity is to be sincere, not just about their feelings but about the degree of intensity of these feelings.\nReasonableness\nIt is our reason that allows us to make and evaluate arguments, so it comes as no surprise that writers want to come across as\nreasonable. Of course, as we have seen in earlier chapters, writers must actually make reasoned arguments or readers will notice\ntheir logical flaws and lose some trust in them. But to trust a writer, readers also need to have the impression that the writer is\nreasonable as a character trait.\nHere are some ways writers show themselves to be reasonable:\nResponding to alternate perspectives with respect. Even when you do not see any merit in the opposing argument, As Jeanne\nFahnestock and Marie Secor put it, \"Without conceding to the opposition, you can show your audience that you treat other\npositions with respect, understanding, and even kindness.\" We can show empathy for the motivations or perspectives of others\neven if we ultimately judge them to be misguided.\nShowing fairness toward alternate perspectives. We see reasonableness in the ways in which writers deal with challenges to\ntheir ideas. Do they summarize the challenge accurately without distorting it to make it seem worse or weaker than it is?\nShowing openness to possibilities that may challenge the writer's expectations. There is some overlap here with honesty as\ndiscussed above.\nMaking concessions when they see some validity to an opposing point.\nShowing moderation. A writer can send the message that they are not an extremist by pointing out and disavowing more\nextreme positions.\nAdmitting uncertainty. As Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor put it \"When you honestly find yourself somewhat uncertain on\nan issue, even after thinking through some arguments, you can shift into a lower gear by admitting your own uncertainty, the\ntentative nature of some of your conclusions, your openness to new ideas.\"\nNote that too much moderation can come across as wishy-washy. Good moral character also requires conviction and backbone. A\nwriter must balance being open and self-critical with being willing to take a stand and defend it.\nPractice Exercise 9.6.1\nFind a speech by a president, former president, or presidential candidate and reflect on how the speaker attempts to establish\ngood moral character in the speech. Which of the strategies listed above do they employ? How well do these strategies work to\nconvince you of the speaker's character?\n9.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32466 This page titled 9.6: Moral Character is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills (ASCCC\nOpen Educational Resources Initiative) .\n9.6.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32466 9.7: Combining Different Approaches to Trust and Connection\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 27 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::2277\nJust as arguments can change tone and emotional appeal, they can appeal to trust differently and create different imagined\nrelationships with the reader at different moments. Arguments don\u2019t need to choose one point of view and stick with it; many\narguments move between \u201cI,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cyou\u201d and the impersonal, shifting from sentence to sentence. Too many shifts could be jarring\nfor the reader, but some variety can be refreshing. Thus, a single argument can offer different ways for the reader to relate to the\nideas at hand.\nFor example, the sample border argument we have analyzed starts with a personal declaration, but if it stayed with \"I\" throughout it\nwould never be able to make an argument about policy. Usually, the first person in argument is combined with other approaches so\nthat the argument can be extended beyond the personal. Let\u2019s look at how the appeals to trust and connection shift in the last two\nparagraphs of the border argument:\nArgument Excerpt Notes on the Point of View\n\u201cI\u201d: The argument starts out with a personal declaration of what the\nauthor herself would do. The repeated emphasis on the \u201cI\u201d provides a\nIf I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community contrast to most news accounts which refer to undocumented\nplagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., immigrants as \u201cthey.\u201d It attempts to reverse a sense that such\nI would take it. immigrants are an outgroup.\nThe mention of the word \"family\" provides the first hint of the appeal to\nshared values around family loyalty and caring for family members.\nI would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough\nThis focuses on a shared value around parents' obligation to nurture\nto eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better\ntheir children with references to children's basic needs.\neducation and a better career.\nThe paragraph ends with a third-person rhetorical question, implying\nthat all parents would do the same.

If I don\u2019t have the papers, I guess it The argument imagines and rejects as ridiculous an \u201cI\u201d statement by an\nwould be wrong\u201d? imaginary parent. This statement is deliberately exaggerated in its\ncontrast between the powerful emotional phrase \"give my child a better\nlife\" and the rather mundane \"I don't have the papers.\"\nThe argument switches to \"us\" and \"we,\" extending the initial personal\nIf most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border\nstatement to include the readers in a group united by a sense that their\nwithout permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we\nobligation to nurture their children takes priority over the obligation to\nmust recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act.\nfollow immigration law.\nIf it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention The impersonal rhetorical question implies the general claim that walls\ncenter be on the side of justice? and detention centers are not right.\nWe must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be The argument returns to the \u201cwe,\u201d ending with a sense that writer and\ntreated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help. readers are united with a common, urgent moral purpose.\nPractice Exercise 9.7.1\nChoose a Ted talk that includes a transcript, such as Jamila Lysicott\u2019s \u201c3 ways to speak English.\u201d Watch the talk and then read\nthe transcript, making notes in the margins on the level of intimacy, degree of formality, appeals to authority, and mentions of\n9.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32469 moral character or shared identity.

We all probably know an\nacquaintance or a family member or a politician who we disagree with strongly on one of these topics, and who seems unlikely to\never change their mind.\nRather than giving up on addressing the opposing side at all, we might consider an approach called Rogerian argument, pioneered\nby therapist Carl Rogers. This approach seeks to shift the focus of an argument from conflict to common ground. It involves an\nemotional and intellectual commitment to move forward together. If a traditional combative argument is like a courtroom debate,\nRogerian argument is like mediation. In the courtroom, judge and jury have to decide between the prosecution and the defense. In\nmediation, both sides are looking for a sweet spot where their needs and opinions intersect.\nWe start by trying to convince the other side that we are not their enemy. If we describe their ideas and feelings with accuracy,\nrespect and empathy, they may soften. If they feel seen rather than judged, they may be more open to what we have to say. The first\nstep in Rogerian argument, then is to research the other side\u2019s beliefs, values, goals, and arguments so we can summarize them in a\nrespectful way.\nIn Rogerian argument, we seek to find empathy and common ground where there is conflict.\nPhoto by Artem Podrez on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nIn Rogerian argument, we also change our end goal. We accept that we will not be able to bring the audience over entirely to our\nway of thinking. Instead, we focus on a more limited claim that both sides can support. The idea is to try to make progress despite\ndeep differences. To get there, we must find beliefs, goals, or values we genuinely share.\nLet\u2019s take the example of the writer who wants the U.S. to help undocumented migrants rather than criminalize them. In Chapters 2\nand 3, we analyze an argument where she tries to create empathy by asking readers to put themselves in the place of a desperate\nmigrant and imagine what they would do. This might work with an undecided audience, but what if she wants to address a group\nof die-hard activists who want a crackdown on illegal immigration? Let\u2019s imagine that this group of activists feels strongly that the\nphysical safety of Americans should be our priority. They are afraid that undocumented immigrants will commit violent crimes.\nOne approach would be to try to convince them that their fears are unfounded. However, given the lack of trust between writer and\naudience, such an attempt might fail. Another approach would be to argue that we must take into account the need of all people to\nbe protected from violence, including refugees who face violence in their countries of origin. This might clash with the activists\u2019\nnationalist belief that American policy should always prioritize the safety of Americans.\nIf the writer were to try a Rogerian approach, she would stop trying to show the activists that they are wrong. She would instead\nspend some time reading about their organization and possibly watching videos of people explaining their ideas. She might even\ninterview one of them to find out what values and experiences led them to their opinions.\nThen she would reflect on what goals and values she could sympathize with or even endorse. In her original argument, she called\nfor \u201cregulation\u201d at the border; she too is concerned for the safety of Americans and believes that open immigration could involve\n9.8.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/82029 some dangers that we should address in our policies. The question is, can she shift the focus of her argument to a claim that will\nboth increase public safety and improve the treatment of the undocumented?\nShe might decide to argue for a border that does a better job of checking each person who is attempting to enter the country. Her\npolicy would turn back more people with criminal backgrounds while also allowing more people to enter legally as economic\nrefugees. In the process of forming this argument, she might actually become more sympathetic to the other side and her position\nmight shift toward the center. She might realize that she does want to \u201csecure the border\u201d and that she is grateful to ICE efforts to\ncombat weapons smuggling, drug cartel operations, and human trafficking. She might also decide that she would support\ndeportation of documented violent criminals. She could use those points to try to reassure her audience that she makes public\nsafety a priority.\nWill this argument actually work to further her original goal? Would the audience become more willing to allow in desperate\nundocumented immigrants if reassured that law enforcement would catch more of the dangerous elements? As a separate question,\nthe author needs to ask herself whether the new argument still represents a message she earnestly wants to send. Does she miss the\nimpassioned plea for empathy and legitimacy for desperate undocumented immigrants? Has she strayed too far from the raw\nexpression of her deep beliefs?\nQuestions of how confrontational and how collaborative argument should be arise constantly in everyday life and in the practice of\ndemocracy. Regardless of whether we personally tend toward conflict or compromise, it\u2019s worth learning the Rogerian process.\nThen when we run into a breakdown in trust, we can at least try out a collaborative approach as a thought experiment and decide\nwhether it is worthwhile.\nPractice Exercise 9.8.1\nChoose a topic on which you hold a strong opinion and read about the opposing side on the website ProCon.org. In a\nparagraph, summarize respectfully what you can learn about the beliefs, values, and viewpoints of the other side. Does this\nresearch suggest any goal you might share with those who disagree with you? Can you come up with a claim that both might\nagree on? Do you think it would be worth pursuing this middle ground, or does it seem more important to you to fight for your\nprecise position?\nThis page titled 9.8: Reaching a Hostile Audience (Rogerian Argument) is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed,\nand\/or curated by Anna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n9.8.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/82029 9.9: Faulty Appeals to Trust\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (12 min, 18 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1122::1188\nJust as we saw with appeals to emotion, appeals to trust and connection may or may not work. But apart from the question of\nwhether or not they work is the question of whether or not they are legitimate. Here are three questions to ask about the legitimacy\nof any appeal to trust:\nDoes the attempt to get the reader to trust suggest an idea that is not logical or not true?\nTo what extent is the appeal to trust really relevant to the trustworthiness of the argument?\nIs the argument asking for more trust than is really warranted? Even if the attempt to gain our trust is logical and relevant, we\nshould ask whether its importance has been exaggerated. Our decision to trust should be based on many different factors. Often\nappeals to trust imply that we should accept or reject a claim outright when in reality more caution is called for.\nWe will see answers to the above questions in each of the following faulty appeals to trust:\nInsincere appeals to shared identity or values\nObviously, lying about who we are or what we believe in is not a valid way to build trust. An appeal to a shared identity that is not\nreally shared or an appeal to a shared value that the writer does not really hold is certainly a breach of trust.\nAn insincere appeal to trust often comes across as creepy.\nPhoto by Parking Thought on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nHowever, referring to an identity that the writer doesn't share can be a legitimate gesture of goodwill, as long as the writer doesn't\nmisrepresent their own background. A white politician who interjects Spanish words into a speech to a largely Latinx audience is\nsignaling that they want to appear friendly and empathetic to a Latinx identity. Of course, the politician's accent may undermine\nthis to some extent by reminding the audience of their different background. Will the audience be glad that the politician is trying?\nWill they be put off by a sense that the politician is presuming too much or encroaching on an identity that doesn't belong to them?\nWriters will often try to signal respect and familiarity if they do refer to another group's identity, as in \"I know from talking to\ntransgender friends that using a single-gender restroom can feel stressful and dangerous.\"\nAppeal to popularity (bandwagon)\nAn extremely common technique is to suggest that a claim is true because it is widely accepted. Of course, we do legitimately need\nto refer to other people's opinions as guides to our own at times. An idea's popularity may be a legitimate reason to investigate it\nfurther. It might be a reason to consider it influential and thus important to address in a discussion. But it's popularity does not\nprove its validity. Popularity may be due to the correctness of the idea but it may be due to many other reasons as well.\n9.9.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32470 Photo by DJ Paine on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nAppeals to popularity encourage readers to base their decisions too much on their underlying desire to fit in, to be hip to what\neverybody else is doing, not to be considered crazy. Imagine that a talk show host introduces a guest as the author of a #1 New York\nTimes bestseller about climate change and the coming apocalypse. But this is a fallacy. We\u2019ve all known it\u2019s a fallacy since we were\nlittle kids, the first time we did something wrong because all of our friends were doing it, too, and our mom or dad asked us, \u201cIf all\nof your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?\u201d\nPersonal attacks\nWe commit this fallacy when, instead of attacking an opponent\u2019s views, we attack the opponent. What makes this a fallacy is the\ndisconnect between the reason and the claim. Logicians call this an ad hominem fallacy, which means \"to the person.\" The\nopponent may have bad qualities, but these qualities do not make their argument incorrect. They may give legitimate reason to trust\nthe argument less, but they do not invalidate it.\nPhoto by Ketut Subiyanto on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nThis fallacy comes in various forms; there are a lot of different ways to attack a person while ignoring (or downplaying) their actual\narguments. Abusive attacks are the most straightforward. The simplest version is simply calling your opponent names instead of\ndebating them. Donald Trump has mastered this technique. During the 2016 Republican presidential primary, he came up with\ncatchy nicknames for his opponents, which he used just about every time he referred to them: \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, \u201cLittle Marco\u201d\nRubio, \u201cLow-Energy Jeb\u201d Bush. If you pepper your descriptions of your opponent with tendentious, unflattering, politically\ncharged language, you can get a rhetorical leg-up.\nAnother abusive attack is guilt by association. Here, you tarnish your opponent by associating them or his views with someone or\nsomething that your audience despises. Consider the following:\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney was an advocate of a strong version of the so-called Unitary Executive interpretation of\nthe Constitution, according to which the president\u2019s control over the executive branch of government is quite firm and far-\nreaching. The effect of this is to concentrate a tremendous amount of power in the Chief Executive, such that those powers\narguably eclipse those of the supposedly co-equal Legislative and Judicial branches of government. You know who else was in\nfavor of a very strong, powerful Chief Executive? That\u2019s right, Hitler.\nThe argument just compared Dick Cheney to Hitler with only the tiniest shred of evidence. That evidence is not sufficient to make\na legitimate comparison: if it were, then any person who favored giving most government power to one leader could be compared\nto Hitler. Clearly, consolidating power was not the most significant thing Hitler did, nor, in itself, is it the reason we have such\nnegative associations with his name. Those powerful negative associations make comparisons to Hitler and the Nazis a powerful\nrhetorical strategy which is often used when it isn't justified. There is even a fake-Latin term for the tactic: Argumentum ad Nazium\n(cf. the real Latin phrase, ad nauseum\u2014to the point of nausea.\n9.9.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32470 A circumstantial attack is not as blunt an instrument as its abusive counterpart. It also involves attacking one\u2019s opponent,\nfocusing on some aspect of their person\u2014their circumstances\u2014as the core of the criticism. This version of the fallacy comes in\nmany different forms, and some of the circumstantial criticisms involved raise legitimate concerns about the relationship between\nthe arguer and his argument. They only become fallacies when these criticisms are taken to be definitive refutations, which, on their\nown, they cannot be.\nTo see what we\u2019re talking about, consider the circumstantial attack that points out one\u2019s opponent\u2019s self-interest in making the\nargument they do. Consider:\nA recent study from scientists at the University of Minnesota claims to show that glyphosate\u2014the main active ingredient in the\nwidely used herbicide Roundup\u2014is safe for humans to use. But guess whose business school just got a huge donation from\nMonsanto, the company that produces Roundup? That\u2019s right, the University of Minnesota. Ever hear of conflict of interest?\nThis study is junk, just like the product it\u2019s defending.\nThis argument is flawed. It doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that the University received a grant from Monsanto that scientists working\nat that school faked the results of a study. But the fact of the grant does raise a red flag. There may be some conflict of interest at\nplay. Such things have happened in the past (e.g., studies funded by Big Tobacco showing that smoking is harmless). But raising\nthe possibility of a conflict is not enough, on its own, to show that the study in question can be dismissed out of hand. It may be\nappropriate to subject it to heightened scrutiny, but we cannot shirk our duty to assess its arguments on their merits.\nA similar thing happens when we point to the hypocrisy of someone making a certain argument\u2014when their actions are\ninconsistent with the conclusion they\u2019re trying to convince us of. Consider the following:\nThe head of the local branch of the American Federation of Teachers union wrote an op-ed yesterday in which she defended\npublic school teachers from criticism and made the case that public schools\u2019 quality has never been higher. But guess what?\nShe sends her own kids to private schools out in the suburbs! What a hypocrite. The public school system is a wreck and we\nneed more accountability for teachers.\nThis passage makes a strong point, but then commits a fallacy. It would appear that, indeed, the AFT leader is hypocritical; her\nchoice to send her kids to private schools suggests (but doesn\u2019t necessarily prove) that she doesn\u2019t believe her own assertions about\nthe quality of public schools. Again, this raises a red flag about her arguments; it\u2019s a reason to subject them to heightened scrutiny.\nBut it is not a sufficient reason to reject them out of hand, and to accept the opposite of her conclusions. That\u2019s committing a\nfallacy. She may have perfectly good reasons, having nothing to do with the allegedly low quality of public schools, for sending her\nkids to the private school in the suburbs. Or she may not. She may secretly think, deep down, that her kids would be better off not\ngoing to public schools. But none of this means her arguments in the op-ed should be dismissed; it\u2019s beside the point. Do her\nreasons back up her conclusion? Are her reasons true? Even if the person arguing is hypocritical, they may still be making a sound\nargument. We still need to decide whether their reasoning is valid before rejecting the argument.\nA very specific version of the circumstantial attack, one that involves pointing out one\u2019s opponent\u2019s hypocrisy, is worth\nhighlighting, since it happens so frequently. It has its own Latin name: tu quoque, which translates roughly as \u201cyou, too.\u201d This is\nthe \u201cI know you are but what am I?\u201d fallacy; the \u201cpot calling the kettle black\u201d; \u201clook who\u2019s talking\u201d. It\u2019s a technique used in very\nspecific circumstances: your opponent accuses you of doing or advocating something that\u2019s wrong, and, instead of making an\nargument to defend the rightness of your actions, you simply throw the accusation back in your opponent\u2019s face\u2014they did it too.\nBut that doesn\u2019t make it right.\nThe final variant of the circumstantial attack is perhaps the most egregious. It\u2019s certainly the most ambitious: it\u2019s a preemptive\nattack on one\u2019s opponent to the effect that, because of the type of person they are, nothing they say on a particular topic can be\ntaken seriously; they are excluded entirely from debate. It\u2019s called poisoning the well. We poison the well when we exclude\nsomeone from a debate because of who they are. Imagine an English person saying, \u201cIt seems to me that you Americans should\nreform your healthcare system. Costs over here are much higher than they are in England. And you have millions of people who\ndon\u2019t even have access to healthcare. In the UK, medical care is a basic right of every citizen.\u201d Suppose an American responded by\nsaying, \u201cWhat you know about it? Go back to England.\u201d That would be poisoning the well. The English person is excluded from\ndebating American healthcare just because of who they are.\n9.9.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/32470 Practice Exercise 9.9.1\nThe following short critique mentions something about the author of the argument they critique.

Such an argument analysis, also called a rhetorical analysis, asks\nyou to describe what the other writer is up to, not just in terms of ideas but in terms of all the strategies they used to make the\nargument convincing. You become a kind of detective, piecing together the moves the writer made, the reasons for them, and their\nlikely effects on readers.\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nIn such an essay, you will need to analyze and evaluate the quality of the logical reasoning, as we learned to do in Chapter 4:\nAssessing the Strength of an Argument. But you will also need to describe and evaluate how the writer seeks to affect readers'\nemotions and gain readers' trust. How well are the author's appeals to trust and emotion likely to work? Will readers likely respond\nas the writer imagines?\nThe introduction should include the title of the argument you analyze and several sentences that summarize the argument.\nImagining an audience unfamiliar with the argument will encourage you to choose your words carefully and offer full explanations.\nAfter introducing readers to the content of the argument, you can state your thesis: your assessment of how convincing the\nargument is and what its weaknesses are, if any.\nThere is a lot to cover in such a paper since you will need to summarize and analyze the ideas, identify strategies the author has\nused, and discuss how readers will respond to these strategies. With so many points to discuss, you may wonder how you can create\na cohesive thesis. The key is to focus on what you consider to be most important in propelling the argument forward or sinking it.\nA thesis can pick two or three important aspects of the argument and identify them as strengths or weaknesses. The more you can\ngroup several different strategies together under a common theme, the more focused and memorable your thesis becomes. For\nexample, if a writer uses \u201cwe\u201d to refer to Latinx people, inserts Spanish phrases, and tells a moving story of a family\u2019s immigration\nto the U.S. from Mexico, you could refer to all three of those aspects of the argument at once in your thesis by noting that the writer\n\u201cappeals to readers\u2019 Latinx identity.\u201d\nEach body paragraph can focus on just one aspect of the reasoning or on an argumentative strategy. In the above example, you\ncould develop one paragraph about the use of \u201cwe\u201d to refer to Latinx people, another paragraph about the use of the Spanish\nlanguage in the argument, and another about how the writer introduces a Spanish-speaking immigrant story. Your transitions could\nrefer to what these paragraphs have in common--a reference to Latinx identity. To support your ideas in each body paragraph, you\ncan use evidence in the form of quotations and paraphrases from the argument analyzed.\nThe conclusion should provide some assessment of the overall effectiveness of the argument. You can make a prediction about how\nmost readers will respond in the end.

This means figuring out who the author is, what kind of text we\nare dealing with, who it is trying to persuade, and when and where it was written. The rhetorical situation (also called kairos) is\nthe combination of author, audience, context, purpose, constraints, and genre. It is the situation shaping the text, the situation to\nwhich the text responds.\nKey Elements of the Rhetorical Situation\nTo fully understand an argument, experienced readers ask big-picture questions about the author, the audience they address, the\ncontext, the genre of the text, the purpose of the text, and the constraints that shape how it is written.\nAuthor\nWho is the author? Where are they coming from? When reading a text, take a few minutes to research who the author is. Who are\nthey, what kind of writing do they do, what organizations do they belong to, what is their reputation?\nIndie Author Day 2017 by BuffaloLibrary on Flickr is licensed CC BY 2.0.\nAudience\nIn 7.2: Tailoring an Argument to an Audience, we discussed how to shape our own arguments with a particular audience in mind.\nWe analyze an argument, we work backward to infer what the intended audience was. From there, we can also infer how the\nwriter's sense of their audience shaped their choices as they wrote.\nWho does it appear the author is trying to reach? How does the author address and imagine the audience?\nIs the text aimed at a particular age, gender, cultural background, class, political orientation, or religion, for example? How is\nthe text shaped to target this audience?\nDoes the text also seem to address a secondary audience?\nFiguring out where the text was published, when it was published, what kind of text it is (speech, op-ed, article, song, etc.), and\nhow it addresses readers can help provide clues to audience.\nWho is likely to find the text important, relevant, or useful? Conversely, who is going to be alienated by the text? Reread the\nfirst page and consider what readers have to believe, value, or care about to get past it. Who is likely to set it aside based on\nsomething they see at the very beginning?\nConsider style, tone, diction, and vocabulary. What do these tell you about the potential audience for the text? Examine the\nother authors and works referred to in the text (if there are footnotes or a Works Cited page, look at what is listed there. Just as\nyou can learn a lot about a person by the people around them, you can learn a lot about a text from all the other texts it\n10.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127290 references). What does the author assume their readers know? What does the author assume about readers\u2019 age, education,\ngender, location, or cultural values?\nPhoto by Matheus Bertelli from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nPurpose\nWhat is the author trying to achieve? What does the author want us to do, believe, or understand? All writing has a purpose. We\nwrite to bring awareness to a problem, make sense of an experience, call people to action, contribute to an area of knowledge,\ncriticize or defend a position, redefine a concept, complain, clarify, challenge, document, create a beautiful story, and entertain (to\nname just a few purposes for writing).\nAs we analyze, we can ask ourselves what seems to be the question at issue. Why has the author written this text? What is the\nproblem, dispute, or question being addressed? What motivated them to write, what do they hope to accomplish?\nAs we saw in 7.1: Deciding the Purpose of a Research-Based Argument, one way to classify arguments is according to the kind of\nquestion they set out to answer. If we determine that the argument we are analyzing is a definition, evaluation, causal, or\nproposal argument, we can look for common elements of that type of argument to help us understand the writer's choices and\nassess their effectiveness.\nArgument Purposes\nQuestion the Argument Answers Argument Purpose\nr\u2026 What is the nature of ________? Definition argument (see 7.3: Definition Arguments)\nr\u2026 How good and\/or bad is ________? Evaluation argument (see 7.4: Evaluation Arguments)\nr\u2026 What caused ________? Causal argument (see 7.5: Causal Arguments)\nr\u2026 What should be done about ________? Proposal argument (see 7.6: Proposal Arguments)\nContext\nContext refers to situational influences that are specific to time, place, and occasion. When and where was the text written, and\nwhere is it intended to be read, seen, or heard? In her book Teaching Arguments, Jennifer Fletcher writes of \"...the immediate social\nspace and situation in which arguments must be made, including what's expected in terms of propriety or fitness for the occasion.\u201d\nWhat is the situation that prompted the writing of this text? What was going on at the time? Can you think of any social,\npolitical, or economic conditions that were particularly important?\nWhat background information on the topic or associations with the topic would a reader of this time period likely have?\nPart of the context is the \u201cconversation\u201d the text is part of. It\u2019s unlikely the author is the first person to write on a particular\ntopic. As Graff and Birkenstein point out, writers invariably add their voices to a larger conversation. How does the author\nrespond to other texts? How does she enter the conversation (\u201cMany authors have argued X, but as Smith shows, this position is\nflawed, and I will extend Smith\u2019s critique by presenting data that shows\u2026\u201d) How does the author position herself in relation to\nother authors?\nHow does the knowledge of the text's original context influence our reading of it? How have circumstances changed since it\nwas written?\n10.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127290 Let's take an example: say we are analyzing an article on climate change, and we find that it doesn't try to prove that climate change\nis happening. Is it neglecting to address a counterargument? Is it making a bold choice to ignore likely objections? To answer, we\nwould need to know in what decade the article was written. In the 1990s, when climate change was first widely publicized, many\npeople doubted whether it was real. Now, in the 2020s, the negative effects of climate change are more prominently visible than\nbefore, and very few people deny that the earth is warming due to human influence. Global warming isn\u2019t talked about like a scary\nmonster that we can warn our children about at bedtime; now, global warming is a very real monster huffing and puffing at our\nfront door. If we were commenting on a dated article on climate change by Glaiza Aquino, we might note something like \"Aquino's\nchoice not to address climate deniers' claims is bold for its time. She counts on others to dispel those claims and focuses instead\non making an informed case for nuclear energy as the only way out of the crisis.\"\nGenre\nGenres are types of communication that have become routine and conventionalized. A poem, meme, lab report, op-ed, and\nmagazine article are all examples of genres. Identifying the text\u2019s genre can tell us a lot about audience, purpose, and context. We\ncan ask ourselves, what kind of writing is this? Is this an academic argument? A Ted Talk? Is this a personal narrative essay that\nexplores a momentous moment in the writer's life? Is this a literary analysis? A letter to the editor in a newspaper?\nGenres give us clues about how we should read a text, what we can do with the text, and who the audience is. Consider the two\nimages below.\n\"Kangaroo Sign at Stuart Highway\" from Wikimedia Commons is licensed under the CC BY SA 3.0 Unported license.\n\"Kangaroo Jump\" by Heather on Flickr, licensed CC BY-NC 2.0.\nThe image below does not, by itself, give much guidance on how we should interpret it. But the image above is in a familiar genre\n\u2013 the road sign. Even if we have never seen a sign like this, we have a good idea of its purpose, intended audience, and meaning.\nIdentifying a text\u2019s genre will often reveal much about the rhetorical situation.\nAttributions\nMuch of this text was adapted by Anna Mills from Reading, Writing, and Evaluating Argument by Chris Werry, Department of\nRhetoric and Writing Studies, San Diego State University, licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\nPortions of the text were written by Dylan Altman.\n10.2: Analyzing an Argument's Situation (Kairos, or the Rhetorical Situation) is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored,\nremixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n10.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127290 10.3: Generating Ideas for an Argument Analysis Paper\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 18 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::1188\nHere are some questions to consider each in relation to the argument you are analyzing.

For a more traditional visual format, see (cid:0)the PDF version of \"Henig's Perspective on the Gender Revolution.\"\nJun Stephens\nEnglish 1C\n14 February 2019\nNote: This essay analyzes the following three-paragraph excerpt from the January 2017 National Geographic article titled \u201cGender\nRevolution: How Science Is Helping Us Understand Gender\u201d\nExcerpt\nEric Vilain, a geneticist and pediatrician who directs the UCLA Center for Gender-Based Biology, says that children express many\ndesires and fantasies in passing. What if saying \u201cI wish I were a girl\u201d is a feeling just as fleeting as wishing to be an astronaut, a\nmonkey, a bird? When we spoke by phone last spring, he told me that most studies investigating young children who express\ndiscomfort with their birth gender suggest they are more likely to turn out to be cisgender (aligned with their birth-assigned gender)\nthan trans\u2014and relative to the general population, more of these kids will eventually identify as gay or bisexual.\n\u201cIf a boy is doing things that are girl-like\u2014he wants long hair, wants to try his mother\u2019s shoes on, wants to wear a dress and play\nwith dolls\u2014then he\u2019s saying to himself, \u2018I\u2019m doing girl things; therefore I must be a girl,\u2019\u201d Vilain said. But these preferences are\ngender expression, not gender identity. Vilain said he\u2019d like parents to take a step back and remind the boy that he can do all sorts\nof things that girls do, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is a girl...\nAs Vilain might have instructed, Mack tried to broaden her child\u2019s understanding of how a boy could behave. \u201cI told my child over\nand over again that he could continue to be a boy and play with all the Barbies he wanted and wear whatever he liked: dresses,\nskirts, all the sparkles money could buy,\u201d Mack said in her podcast, How to Be a Girl. \u201cBut my child said no, absolutely not. She\nwas a girl.\u201d (Note: the excerpt ends here.)\nHenig\u2019s Perspective on the Gender Revolution\nThe above excerpt is from Robin Marantz Henig\u2019s article in the January 2017 issue of National Geographic called \u201cGender\nRevolution: How Science Is Helping Us Understand Gender.\u201d (Note: The introduction signals that the argument analyzed contrasts\nthe ideas of two other thinkers.) Here she offers two interesting points of view: that of Eric Vilain, geneticist, pediatrician, and\ndirector of the UCLA Center for Gender-Based Biology, and Marlo Mack, a mom of a transgender girl and creator of the podcast\n\u201cHow to Be a Girl.\u201d Vilain states that children can\u2019t differentiate between gender expression and gender identity easily, and that\nthey go through many phases of wanting to be impossible things. (Note: Summary of a summary of the ideas of the first thinker\ndiscussed in Henig's argument and the contrasting response of the second thinker.) He says most studies on children questioning\ntheir birth-assigned gender suggest they are more likely to be cisgender than transgender later on. He advises parents of questioning\nchildren to \u201ctake a step back\u201d and tell their children that they can do anything a child of another gender can do, but it doesn\u2019t mean\nthey aren\u2019t the gender they were assigned at birth. Mack, however, has tried this with her daughter, who, even though she was told\nthat boys can play with Barbies and wear dresses, insisted that she was a girl every time.\nThe author relies on Vilain\u2019s scholarly reputation. He is a doctor, scientist, and in charge of a gender-related facility at a prestigious\nuniversity. (Note: Discusses how Henig establishes Vilain as an authority to be trusted, with partial success.) However, from an\nintrinsic ethos perspective, the quotes included for him leave something to be desired. He said that most studies on children who\n10.5.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92717 show discomfort with their assigned at birth gender reveal that most of those children remain cisgender (identifies with their\nassigned at birth gender). This leaves the reader with questions. How did they define \u201cdiscomfort\u201d with their gender and for how\nlong had they been expressing those feelings? A specific cited study that is well respected amongst pediatricians, endocrinologists,\nand psychologists working with trans children would have increased the support for his claim. The author let the reader ask these\nquestions and look at his argument critically.\nAs well as a trust strategy, Henig presents Vilain\u2019s argument with sound reasoning. (Note: Compares the main strength of the Vilain\nargument--sound reasoning--with the main strength of the Mack argument, its appeal to sympathy with parental care.)What is\nquoted from him is logical. His claim is that children shouldn\u2019t be trusted to identify their gender. His warrant is that children go\nthrough many phases of wanting to be things they\u2019re not, and that children can\u2019t differentiate between gender expression and\nidentity. Finally, his reason is that one\u2019s gender identity is not a phase, or gender expression. This is countered with Mack\u2019s\nargument which although it also has sound reasoning, is unique because of it\u2019s appeal to emotion. Henig knows the National\nGeographic audience to be one composed of everyday people and families, so an argument with an emotional appeal that is\nrelatable to readers is a convincing tool. She knows the values of her audience.\nThe author introduces Mack one paragraph away from Villain's last words. He said \u201che\u2019d like parents to take a step back and\nremind the boy that he can do all sorts of things that girls do, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is a girl.\u201d A better quote could not have been\nchosen by Henig for Mack to respond to. The author begins with \u201cAs Vilain might have instructed,\u201d to start Mack\u2019s account of her\nexperience. (Note: Shows how the summary of the second argument is effectively poised to counter the first.) Mack is a parent\nwith a trans girl, and the article states \u201c\u2018I told my child over and over again that he could continue to be a boy and play with all the\nBarbies he wanted...But my child said no, absolutely not. She was a girl.\u201d Not only does this respond directly to Vilain\u2019s call to\naction\u2014or inaction, rather, but it breaks down his assumption. His assumption was that children go through many phases of\nwanting to be things they\u2019re not, and that children can\u2019t differentiate between gender expression and identity. If his argument were\nto stand, Mack\u2019s daughter would\u2019ve told her mom that she didn\u2019t know boys could play with girl things. She didn\u2019t. (Note: Shows\nhow Henig's description of the arguments accentuates Vilain's weakness.)\nPerhaps Vilain has conceded to children in the past, and has personally had experience with those who do know the difference\nbetween gender expression and identity, such as Mack\u2019s daughter. This would have proved for a stronger argument from Vilain, and\nwould have convinced the reader that he is reasonable, and not an extremist. Either such a case of his has yet to exist, or the author\npurposefully left it out. Henig provided us with a real example of someone trying Vilain\u2019s technique, and it failing over and over.\nThe similar use of language in Vilain\u2019s section and in Mack\u2019s section, as well as the placement of their arguments one after another,\nshow that the author intended for the reader to choose one side over the other. (Note: Highlights Henig's indirect method of\nconvincing the readers of one side through the argument's structure.)\nHenig\u2019s article is an apparently unbiased piece on gender and how people come to identify. However, the positioning of Mack\u2019s\nresponse to Vilain\u2019s technique on raising gender-questioning children shows Henig\u2019s support for Mack, and therefore supports\nchildren deciding their own gender. She does this by choosing a quote from Mack that would convince the reader with intrinsic\nethos. She gets a different perspective by having the counterpoint be presented by a mother of a trans child, as opposed to only\nshowing scientists\u2019 perspectives. Henig positions Mack\u2019s story right after Vilain in this article. While it would still be relevant\nelsewhere, that positioning and the quote she chose indicates that it is a response to Vilain\u2019s statement just a couple paragraphs\nbefore. These strategies were effectively used by Henig to endorse one side of this controversial argument. Because of this, the\nreader is inclined to agree, and will come out of reading an almost neutral article with support for Mack and her experience. (Note:\nHere we find the positive evaluation of the effectiveness of Henig's argument as a whole.)\nAttribution\nThe essay was written by Jun Stephens and adapted with her permission for use in the textbook How Arguments Work.

However, a decade ago at the\ntime of its launch, the iPad actually sparked idealistic, energetic protest. (Note: The opening seeks to catch the reader's interest\nthrough the contrast between today's perspective and a decade ago.) (Note: Mentions the author, title, and place of publication of\nthe argument analyzed.) Writers like Cory Doctorow lamented the way the iPad shut down possibilities for an open platform not\ncontrolled by a single company. Doctorow\u2019s 2010 article \u201cWhy I Won\u2019t Buy an iPad (and Think You Shouldn\u2019t, Either)\u201d on\nBoingBoing critiques the iPad in the face of enormous media hype over its release. Apple proclaimed the iPad a technological\nrevolution, but Doctorow thinks the real revolution would consist in opening up the hardware and software to consumers to modify.\n(Note: A teaser hinting at the argument's main point.)\nDoctorow\u2019s perspective in this article grows out of his passionate advocacy of free digital media sharing. He got his start as a CD-\nROM programmer and is now a successful blogger and author on the tech site BoingBoing. (Note: Background on the author's\ninterests and credibility.) In this article, he argues that the iPad is just another way for established technology companies to control\nour technological freedom and creativity. Doctorow complains that Apple limits the digital rights of those who use its products by\ncontrolling the content that can be used and created on the device. (Note: Summary of Doctorow's thesis.) While he cites valid\nconcerns, his argument against buying the iPad will likely only persuade software developers. The disadvantages he cites for\nconsumers are slight compared with the advantage of smooth user experience the iPad offers. Yet his argument remains relevant to\nall today because it can revive a sense of excitement and possibility around open models that could still be developed with the right\npolicies. (Note: Three sentences work together as the full thesis. The first provides a negative assessment of the argument. The\nsecond explains the reason for the failure. The third suggests a way the argument could still inspire us.)\nDoctorow draws readers in by encouraging them to side with him as a smart, hip techie. (Note: Topic sentence shows how one of\nDoctorow's strategies affects the reader. No technical rhetoric terms are needed, but we see from the wording that this paragraph\nfocuses on an emotional appeal.) He builds credibility by quoting popular science fiction writer and technology guru William\nGibson, known among techies as a brilliant expert, the one who coined the term \u201cvirtual reality.\u201d Doctorow joins with Gibson in\nscoring the idea that consumers are passive and stupid by quoting at length Gibson\u2019s satirical picture of this view of the consumer\nas a drooling mutant. The implication is that corporations that try to create a streamlined user experience are dumbing things down\ntoo much. Doctorow implies that smart and creative users will be offended by these assumptions. He appeals to readers\u2019 pride as he\ninvites us to see ourselves as active, creative consumers who reject technology built for dummies.\nDoctorow creates a sense of the wonderful, cheap variety that users could enjoy if they weren\u2019t bound by Apple\u2019s restrictive,\nexpensive platform. (Note: This paragraph describes one reason Doctorow gives not to buy the iPad, but it also shows how he\ncreates a feeling of excitement as he gives that reason.) He argues that consumers do not have to settle for limited digital rights; we\nhave other options. According to him, \u201cThe reason people have stopped paying for a lot of \u2018content\u2019 isn\u2019t just that they can get it\nfor free, though: it\u2019s that they can get lots of competing stuff for free, too\u201d (4). Doctorow essentially says, \u201cYou could have this one\n10.6.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92718 thing\u2026or you could have all of these things.\u201d Why pay for an expensive iPad and monitored apps, when you can get equal or better\nproducts and programs for free?\nHe underscores this vision of abundance by appealing to the value of freedom. (Note: The transition refers back to the idea of the\nprevious paragraph (summarized in the word \"abundance\") and introduces a complementary appeal.) He writes, \u201cAs an adult, I\nwant to be able to choose whose stuff I buy and whom I trust to evaluate that stuff. I don\u2019t want my universe of apps constrained to\nthe stuff that the Cupertino Politburo decides to allow for its platform\u201d (3). By referencing the constricting forces of Communist\nRussia, the author appeals to a basic human fear of being controlled. He stirs up a natural rebellion against being told what to do.\nHe appeals to our patriotism by implying that an open digital platform is more American, whereas Apple\u2019s policies are more typical\nof a totalitarian regime like the Soviet Union.\nDoctorow appeals effectively to our values and pride in the way he contrasts the open approach to the consumer with the Apple\napproach. (Note: This sentence summarizes the previous body paragraphs by pointing out that they all show the success of\nemotional appeals.) However, he does not bother to support his claim that consumers can really get what they want from an open\nplatform. (Note: The paper turns toward critique with the word \"however\" and then undercuts the more positive assessment of the\nprevious paragraph by citing a lack of evidence and possible bias.) He asserts that the free products available elsewhere are just as\ngood as what the iPad offers, but are they really? Doctorow provides no evidence that this is so. Rather, he creates the suspicion\nthat his interests as an independent software creator guide his assessment more than the actual consumer experience. As a software\ncreator, he has something personal to gain from free digital media sharing and thus opposes digital rights management (DRM). He\nreminds us that he identifies as a developer when he writes, \u201cIt [Apple] uses DRM to control what can run on your devices, which\nmeans that...Apple developers can\u2019t sell on their own terms\u201d (3). He fumes, \u201cOf course I believe in a market where competition can\ntake place without bending my knee to a company that has erected a drawbridge between me and my customers!\u201d (3). The problem\nis that not everyone is interested in making or modifying software, and, therefore, not everyone cares.\nDoctorow wants consumers to take an active role like software developers, but that is his priority, not everyone\u2019s. He overestimates\nhow much intelligent consumers want to look under the hood of their device and their apps. He underestimates how much they\nwant a streamlined experience so they can focus on their own objectives. Doctorow could have been more fair-minded about the\nbenefits of owning the iPad and, by implication, the benefits big corporations can offer consumers. His only positive mention of the\niPad states, \u201cClearly there\u2019s a lot of thoughtfulness and smarts that went into the design\u201d (2). He could have gone on to\nacknowledge that the iPad could be a great piece of equipment for people who are willing to commit to one platform. If he had\nconceded this, he would have built credibility as a person in touch with consumer needs. (Note: Doctorow's failure to recognize his\nreaders' needs costs him readers' trust.)\nThe last decade has shown that the iPad succeeded in convincing consumers. (Note: A historical claim that doesn't reference the\ntext introduces a larger perspective on the argument.) Doctorow\u2019s idea of an open platform never materialized. Apple has\nencountered competition in the tablet market only from other huge companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Samsung that offer\nsimilarly proprietary platforms. (Note: A concluding meditation on the value of the argument.) Yet Doctorow\u2019s article still has\nvalue because it reminds us of the possibility of a different model. He should follow it up today with a proposal for 2020, a longer\nrange vision for replacing these closed corporate platforms with an open marketplace. (Note: Suggests a way in which the\nargument could be made more convincing by changing its focus to one that it can achieve.) After all, his real enemy is not the iPad,\nbut the laws that allow for digital rights management and monopolistic power. It remains to be seen whether, given the right\ngovernment regulation, an open platform could give consumers ease of use at the same time as it gave everyone access to create\nand sell and modify software. Maybe a glance at Doctorow\u2019s vision from 2010 will yet help us move toward that vision. (Note:\nFinal reference to the value of the argument, using language intended to inspire.)\nWork Cited\nDoctorow, Cory. \u201cWhy I Won\u2019t Buy an iPad (and Think You Shouldn\u2019t, Either).\u201d BoingBoing. 2 Apr. 2010.

(Note: The author introduces visual arguments as an everyday\nphenomenon that the reader may often encounter without consciously recognizing as arguments. Virtually every man-made image\nis meant to communicate something, and even things so simple and everyday as magazine advertisements or internet banner ads\u2014\nthings we see so often that we often no longer consciously notice\u2014convey the implied argument that we should buy a product,\nsubscribe to a service, or otherwise do what the advertisement wants us to do. The same is nonetheless true of military recruitment\nposters and ads, which generally share the same common argument: the viewer should join the Armed Forces. (Note: This\nstatement narrows the broad topic of visual arguments down to a particular example: military recruitment posters and ads.\nThe entry of the United States into World War I led to a massive recruitment drive for military service as a nation without a large\nstanding army was drawn into an ongoing conflict and forced to rapidly mobilize the population. (Note: This paragraph provides\nhistorical context for the posters under discussion, focusing the lens on WWI recruitment in the United States. Although a draft\nwas issued, making military service for draftees compulsory, there was understandably a vested national interest in recruiting as\nmany volunteers for the armed services as possible. These two recruitment posters below (Figs. 1 and 2), originally printed during\nWorld War I and for the United States Army and Navy respectively, use different techniques to appeal to potential recruits'\nsensibilities and desires. (Note: This is the essay's real thesis, citing the Army and Navy posters as using different techniques to\nappeal to readers. Comparing these techniques is the focus of the essay's body paragraphs.\nThe \u201cI Want YOU for U.S. Army\u201d poster, featuring James Montgomery Flagg's iconic illustration of Uncle Sam, is an image so\ninstantly recognizable that it has become part of the American cultural vocabulary (Fig. 1). (Note: The beginning of this body\nparagraph introduces the name and source for Figure 1. Uncle Sam, with his red, white, and blue wardrobe and star-spangled hat,\ndraws on the iconography of the American flag to represent something of the American national spirit. (Note: The author describes\n10.8.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92721 the poster's imagery and typography, what the poster denotes. Although depicted as an older man, with longish white beard and\nhair and bushy white eyebrows, he is depicted as active and authoritative, staring and pointing with one finger at the viewer. Even\nwithout the text, it is clear from Uncle Sam's posture and gesture that we, the viewer, are the one being addressed. The text makes\nthe poster's appeal explicit: \u201cI Want YOU for U.S. Army,\u201d with the \u201cYOU\u201d highlighted in red text for added emphasis. (Note: The\nauthor here shifts into an analysis of what that imagery may mean, or what feelings or ideas it may arouse (what the poster\nconnotes). The appeal here is primarily one to trust: this character of the national spirit, drawn as an older and paternalistic figure,\ncalls on the viewer directly to go to the \u201cNearest Recruiting Station.\u201d Given that the average Army recruit is bound to be a younger\nman, this appeal from an older, paternal figure endows the appeal to enlist with an almost filial sense of obligation: if obeying one's\nfather is what a good son does, obeying Uncle Sam is what a good citizen does. Uncle Sam's unsmiling expression signals to the\nrecruit that this appeal to join is a matter of grave importance and urgency, and clearly no laughing matter.\nThe naval recruitment poster, featuring Richard Fayerweather Babcock's illustration of a sailor riding a torpedo, employs an\nentirely different aesthetic and makes a radically different appeal to its audience. (Note: The author introduces the name and source\nof Figure 2, while also emphasizing its contrast with Figure 1. If the Army recruitment poster invokes a sense of solemn duty, the\nNavy recruitment poster invokes a sense of adventure. (Note: Here a different pattern is employed: instead of talking about the\nimagery or type first, the author first describes the feelings aroused by the poster, contrasting these with Figure 1. Rather than a\nfigure addressing the viewer, we see a sailor riding a torpedo in the manner of a rodeo cowboy riding a bull--even with reins\n(somewhat inexplicably) in hand. (Note: This passage describes Figure 2's imagery and typography, its content, similar to how the\nlast paragraph described the imagery of Figure 1\u2026 The torpedo, rather than submerged in the water, kicks up spray by the sailor's\nfeet as it skims the water's surface. The sailor's right hand wields a length of rope to act as a crop, showing that he is not a passive\npassenger on his unlikely steed but in control, whipping it forward, onward. Without context, this image might be confusing as it\nemploys not only an unrealistic depiction of the life of the average sailor but also one that seems as reckless and suicidal as well,\nriding a bomb. However, the poster's text clarifies its appeal and makes it explicit: \u201cJoin the Navy, the Service for Fighting Men.\u201d\n(Note: Here the argument shifts again into an analysis of the emotional appeal being made there. The characterization of the Navy\nas the \u201cService for Fighting Men,\u201d combined with the rodeo cowboy imagery, the inherent and obvious danger of riding an\n(arguably phallic) torpedo qualify the poster's call to wild adventure with a macho, masculine sensibility. Again, given that the\naverage recruit is a young man, these subtle and not-so-subtle appeals to the viewer's masculinity qualify as appeals to the viewer's\nemotions and self-image. If the Uncle Sam poster gravely calls on dutiful citizens to join the Army, the Navy poster calls on\nadventurous \u201cFighting Men.\u201d While this poster may have been effective at reaching the audience of its time, it must be noted that\naudience of a modern Naval recruitment poster has changed. (Note: Unlike the previous paragraph, there is an additional analysis\nprovided of how the appeal of Figure 2's argument has perhaps not aged as well as that of Figure 1. With the abolition of gender\nrestrictions in the Armed Forces and the re-orientation of recruitment efforts, it's likely that a poster calling on \u201cFighting Men\u201d to\nenlist would prove less appealing to a broader audience. Also, the cultural connotation of riding a bomb has itself changed, and\nwould today perhaps be sooner associated with Dr. Strangelove and catastrophic self-destruction than a call to adventure.\nAnalysis of visual arguments can be rewarding and surprising. (Note: The essay returns to the broader subject of visual arguments\nand how visual elements can enhance, strengthen, or complicate the argument beyond what can be achieved through words alone.\nImages can subtly convey a rich and dense amount of information, saying a lot without necessarily saying anything at all. In these\nexamples, most of the message is carried in image alone. Text slogans like \u201cI Want You for U.S. Army\u201d and \u201cJoin the Navy\u201d would\nhardly capture a sense of grave patriotic duty or wild, dangerous adventure without such evocative illustrations to appeal to\n10.8.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/92721 patriotism and a collective national identity or a wild adventure on the high seas. The effectiveness and appeal of these posters are\nenough to show how effective a non-verbal argument can be.\nWorks Cited\n(Note: Works Cited page uses MLA documentation style appropriate for an English class.\nBabcock, Richard Fayerweather, Artist.

So many of us, whether we are beginning or experienced writers, feel anxious or even paralyzed as we\nface a new assignment. We may feel discouraged and question our skill because we can't envision a fully-formed essay on the spot.\nBut it's not actually a bad sign if we can't. As Anne Lamott says in her book Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life,\n\u201cAlmost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere.\u201d Writing itself will help us form our ideas\nif we take it step by step. In Section 1.1: Why Study Argument? we suggested that writing helps us think clearly and deeply about\na topic. We may start with little to no idea of where we are going, or we may have a working idea. Either way, if we engage in the\nprocess, we almost always get to greater insight and clarity for ourselves and our readers.\nBelow are the common steps most writers follow to move through the early stages of murky thoughts. In general, the order of these\nsteps makes sense, but we are not bound to it. We can customize the process to fit our own style and the particular assignment. The\nkey is to notice what is challenging at each point and find the strategy that will help the most. Often, a question or problem will\narise as we work, and returning to an earlier strategy in the writing process can help us resolve the difficulty.\nStudying the prompt: The instructor's guidance can help us focus our efforts from the start so we don't spend time writing\nsomething that doesn't fit the assignment.\nReading and annotating: Reading, rereading, and making notes on other texts is often the first step toward coming up with our\nown contribution to the larger conversation. As we have seen, most college writing comments on or responds to the arguments\nof others.\nGenerating ideas: Various prewriting strategies can help us decide what to write about and gather specifics to support or\nexplain what we want to say.\nPlanning how to organize the ideas: Outlines, formal or informal, can help us structure the essay.\nDrafting: Writing the first version of the essay, often called the rough draft. Most writers go through many drafts.\nRevising: Reconsidering the ideas and content of the essay as well as refining the style and structure of the paper.\nEditing: Correcting grammar, punctuation, spelling, and mechanics. We can also call this proofreading.\nPublishing: Sharing the final draft with others.\n11.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120088 \u201cThe Writing Proces,\u201d Kalyca Schultz, Virginia Western Community College, is licensed under CC-0.

Reading doesn't have to be passive; we can find our own voices as we begin a\nconversation with the text. As a step in the writing process, annotation can be invaluable. As we have seen in this book, most\ncollege writing assignments ask us to respond to other arguments. e don't have to pull our ideas out of thin air. Early in the writing\nprocess, we can get ideas by rereading and making notes on any text we are going to write about. These notes will help us come up\nwith specific points to make in our essay. We may even be able to copy and paste whole sentences of annotation into an essay first\ndraft.\nPhoto by Jeswin Thomas on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nAnnotate to engage\nAnnotating can help us stay focused on, and emotionally and intellectually connected to, what we are reading. It suggests that we\nfeel empowered to speak back to the text.\nStrategies for Engaging with a Text through Annotation\nWhat we might do or think What we might write\n\u2026 Respond to the text emotionally \"Inspiring :-) Discouraging :-(\"\n\"Ref.

It can also help us prepare to write a summary, as we saw in Chapter 3. Noting any difficulties we have with understanding\ncan remind us to ask or research the question later, and it can also get our minds working on solving the problem.\nStrategies for Understanding a Text through Annotation\nWhat we might do or think What we might write\n\u2026 We don\u2019t understand a word or term, so we go back and reread the Circle the word, and, after we figure out its meaning, write the meaning\nsentence and figure it out \u2013 or look it up. next to the word.\n\u2026 We don\u2019t understand a word, but realize we can keep reading and still\nCircle the word and look it up later.\nunderstand.

Often these notes about possible strengths and weaknesses will point us toward our own\noriginal responses, suggestions, or counterarguments.\nStrategies for Assessing or Comparing a Text through Annotation\nWhat we might do or think What we might write\n\"This seems like an isolated case.

We can call these methods\nbrainstorming techniques or invention techniques. They all have a few common rules:\nWrite down everything that occurs to you; don\u2019t eliminate anything until you are done brainstorming.\nDon\u2019t bother with editing at this stage.\nWork as quickly as you can.\nListing\nBrainstorm list: Simply make a list of all the ideas related to your topic. Do not censor your ideas; write everything down,\nknowing you can cross some off later. As you brainstorm, try not to focus your writing radar too narrowly, on a single aspect of\nyour topic or a single question. The broader you cast your brainstorming net, the better because a large list of possibilities will give\nyou a wealth of choices when time comes to compose your first draft.\nWhat I know\/don\u2019t know lists: If you know that your topic will require research, you can make two lists. The first will be a list of\nwhat you already know about your topic; the second will be a list of what you don\u2019t know and will have to research. For example,\nyou might label one list \"10 things I know to be true about\u2026\" and another \"10 things I wonder about...\"\nImage by Nenad Stojkovic on Flickr, licensed CC BY 2.0.\nMapping\nA mind map or cluster is a method of brainstorming that allows you to draw connections between ideas.\n1. To make a cluster, start with a big concept related to your assignment prompt. Write this in the center of a page or screen and\ncircle it.\n2. Think of ideas that connect to the big concept or branch out of it. Write these around the big concept and draw connecting lines\nto the big concept.\n3. As you think of ideas that relate to any of the others, create more connections by writing those ideas around the one idea that\nconnects them and draw connecting lines.\nNotice that you can use color, larger type, etc., to create organization and emphasis.\n11.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120091 Image by Rob Enslin on Flickr, licensed CC BY 2.0.\nFreewriting\nFreewriting is an exercise in which you write freely (jot, list, write paragraphs, write question, take off on tangents: whatever \u201cfree\u201d\nmeans to you) about a topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes or until you run out of ideas or energy).\nTry to write without checking, censoring, or editing yourself in any way. Don't put your pen or pencil down, or stop typing on the\ncomputer, no matter what. Let your mind go, go with the flow, and don\u2019t worry about the end product. Don\u2019t even worry about\nfinishing your sentences or separating your paragraphs. You are not writing a draft of your paper. Instead, you are producing raw\nmaterial. Later on, you just might find a gem of an idea in that raw material which you can develop into a complete draft.\nWrite as much as you can, as quickly as you can.\nDon\u2019t edit or cross anything out. (Note: if you must edit as you go, just write the correction and keep moving along. Don\u2019t go\nfor the perfect word, just get the idea on the page.)\nKeep your pen, pencil, or fingers on the keyboard moving.\nYou don\u2019t need to stay on topic or write in any order. Feel free to follow tangents.\nIf you get stuck, write a repeating phrase until your brain gets tired and gives you something else to write. (For example, \"I\nreally hate having to do this, why isn\u2019t it lunch-time already, please let me think of something, please let me think of\nsomething.\")\nChoose a prompt, an idea or question that gets you started. An example of a writing prompt might be \u201cWhat do I already know\nabout this topic?\u201d Or \u201cWhat is the first idea I have about my topic?\u201d If you started with a list or an outline, you can freewrite\nabout each item.\nLooping\nLooping is a technique built on freewriting. It can help you move within a topic to get all related ideas into writing.\n1. To begin, start with a freewrite on a topic. Set a timer and write for 5-15 minutes (whatever you think will be enough time to get\ngoing but not so much that you will want to stop).\n2. When the time period ends, take a short break. Read over what you\u2019ve written and circle anything that needs to be fleshed out\nor that branches into new ideas. Select one of these for your next loop.\n3. Freewrite again for the same time period, using the idea you selected from the first freewrite.\n4. Repeat as long as you see an interesting idea that could be expanded.\nFor more on using a timer and breaks to get going on tasks you tend to procrastinate on, you may want to read about the Pomodoro\nTechnique.\n11.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120091 Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nAsking Questions\nTo stimulate ideas, you can ask questions that help you generate content. Use some of the examples below or come up with your\nown.\nProblem\/Solution: What is the problem that your writing is trying to solve? Who or what is part of the problem? What solutions\ncan you think of? How would each solution be accomplished?\nCause\/Effect: What is the reason behind your topic? Why is it an issue? Conversely, what is the effect of your topic? Who will be\naffected by it?\nThe set of 5 journalist\u2019s questions, sometimes called the five W\u2019s, can help us generate basic information about a topic. Here are\nthe questions:\nWho: Who is involved? Who is affected?\nWhat: What is happening? What will happen? What should happen?\nWhere: Where is it happening?\nWhen: When is it happening?\nWhy\/how: Why is this happening? How is it happening?\nImage by Valerie Everett on Flickr, licensed CC BY SA 2.0.\nTalking\nSome of us feel more comfortable expressing ourselves in conversation than on the page. We can generate ideas by speaking aloud\nas well; this may stimulate our brain in a different way. All of the above strategies can be adapted for speaking rather than typing\nor writing. These spoken brainstorms can be social or solitary. Here are a few approaches:\nConversations with peer or tutors\nA conversation with a live person can help us come up with ideas that might not have occurred to us if we weren't energized by the\nother person and imagining what might interest them. It can work well to follow up more solitary kinds of brainstorming with a\npeer or group time to share what we came up with. Writing tutors are usually trained to question, encourage and draw out ideas.\nPhoto by fauxels from Pexels under the Pexels License.\n11.3.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120091 Talking to ourselves\nIf we can let go of feeling foolish, a private conversation with ourselves can be a great way to get past writer's block and tap into\nnew energy. We could start a monologue with our questions and doubts. For example, \"Hmm, well, I'm somewhat interested in\nelectric cars, but I know so many people are doing that topic. What would my angle be? The battery problems in these cars are\nsevere, so I don't want to endorse them, but I don't want to give up on them either...\"\nVoice typing\nMost word processing programs now, including Google Docs, include voice typing features that allow us to speak and see the\nwords transcribed on the page. We might have to edit the transcription later, of course, but if we can bring ourselves to talk but we\ncan't bring ourselves to write, this is a great way to get something down.\nRecording ourselves\nWe can use our phones to record voice memos of ideas at any time. If your voicemail transcribes your message automatically, you\ncan leave yourself voice messages and glance at what you've said later for reference.\nImage by IO-Images from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from The Word on College Reading and Writing by Carol Burnell, Jaime Wood, Monique Babin, Susan\nPesznecker, and Nicole Rosevear of Clackamas Community College and Portland State University, published\nby OpenOregon under a CC BY-NC license.\nSelect sentences and paragraphs added from Methods of Discovery by Pavel Zemliansky, licensed CC BY NC-SA 3.0.\nThe section on \"Talking\" is original content by Anna Mills, licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\n11.3: Brainstorming is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n11.3.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120091 11.4: Outlining\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (9 min, 44 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 99::4444\nOnce we have plenty of ideas for an essay, writing an outline can help us organize them. Outlining makes sense when we know a\ntopic well or at least know the areas we want to explore. Outlines range from formal to informal. Not all writers use outlines; many\nwriters work best from a list of ideas or from freewriting, but in some cases, outlines can save us a lot of rewriting later on.\nLike a sketch of an item we want to make, a written outline shows the basic structure of an essay.\nImage by Michael Burrows on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nTraditional outlines\nA traditional outline uses a numbering and indentation scheme to help organize your thoughts. Generally, you begin with your main\npoint, perhaps stated as a thesis (see \u201cFinding the Thesis\u201d in the \u201cDrafting Section\u201d), and place the subtopics, usually the main\nsupports for your thesis\/main point, and finally flesh out the details underneath each subtopic. Each subtopic is numbered and has\nthe same level of indentation. Details under each subtopic are given a different style of number or letter and are indented further to\nthe right. It\u2019s expected that each subtopic will merit at least two details.\nHow much should I write?\nPhrase outlines\nA phrase may be sufficient to describe each topic sentence or supporting detail. It is usually helpful to write a whole sentence to\ndescribe the thesis in order to specify not just the topic, but what you plan to say about it.\nSentence outlines\nWriting a full sentence for each supporting idea and detail challenges us to clarify what we are going to say about each point and to\nthink through how it relates to the other points and the thesis. Some instructors require a complete sentence for each item in a\nformal outline.\nSample traditional outline format\nI. Major idea or thesis\na. Supporting idea\ni. Detail\nii. Detail\niii.

You might try color-coding like items and then grouping the items with the same color together.\nAnother method is to print your prewriting, then cut it up into smaller pieces, and finally put the pieces into piles of related items.\nTape the like items together, then put the pieces together into a whole list\/outline\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from The Word on College Reading and Writing by Carol Burnell, Jaime Wood, Monique Babin, Susan\nPesznecker, and Nicole Rosevear of Clackamas Community College and Portland State University, published\nby OpenOregon under a CC BY-NC license.\nThe sample traditional outline comes from English Composition I from Saylor Academy, licensed CC BY NC SA 3.0.\nThis page titled 11.4: Outlining is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Carol Burnell, Jaime\nWood, Monique Babin, Susan Pesznecker, and Nicole Rosevear (OpenOregon) via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the\nLibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\n11.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120092 11.5: Drafting\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 22 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::2222\nDrafting is the stage of the writing process in which we develop a complete first version of a piece of writing. If we have done\nsome prewriting, we probably have sentences and ideas that can become part of the draft.\nPhoto by Vlada Karpovich on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nTips for getting going\nIf you are more comfortable starting on paper than on the computer, you can start on paper and then type it before you revise. You\ncan also use a voice recorder to get yourself started, dictating a paragraph or two to get you thinking. The following approaches\nmay help as you begin to write:\nBegin writing with the part that is clearest in your mind. There is no need to write in the order that the paragraphs will\nappeal in the end. You can start with the third paragraph in your outline if ideas come easily to mind. You can start with the\nsecond paragraph or the first paragraph, too. Many people write your introduction and conclusion last, after they have fleshed\nout the body paragraphs.\nTake short breaks to refresh your mind. This tip might be most useful if you are writing a multipage report or essay. Still, if\nyou are antsy or cannot concentrate, take a break to let your mind rest. Don't beat yourself up. Try setting an alarm to limit your\nbreak, and when the time is up, return to your desk to write. As Anne Lamott says in her book Bird by Bird: Some Instructions\non Writing and Life, \"Try looking at your mind as a wayward puppy that you are trying to paper train. You don't drop-kick a\npuppy into the neighbor's yard every time it piddles on the floor. You just keep bringing it back to the newspaper.\u201d\nDon't let your inner critic slow you down. Anne Lamott says, \"Perfectionism...is the main obstacle between you and a shitty\nfirst draft.\" Try to think of the bad first draft as the goal, not a sign of failure. A bad first draft is a step forward. Try to let go of\nyour worries. There will be time to rethink, rephrase, and rework during the revision process.\nRefer back to your prewriting. If you are stuck, you may want to copy and paste something in from a brainstorm. If you have\nan outline, use it to guide the development of your paragraphs and the elaboration of your ideas. Each main idea becomes the\n11.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120093 topic of a new paragraph. Develop it with the supporting details and the subpoints of those details that you included in your\noutline.\nSet small goals and time yourself. Some call this \"fast drafting.\" By experimenting, you can figure out how long you can\nusually concentrate given the right conditions: 30 minutes? 60 minutes? 75? Plan one longer session or several shorter ones.\nDecide on the goal: Write a paragraph in 10 minutes, 2 pages in 1 hour, or a complete essay in 1 hour and 15 minutes. Turn off\nphones and social media, close extra browser windows and tabs, let the dog outside. This needs to be quiet, concentrated\ntime. You may want to tie a small reward to each goal like watching a video, eating a snack, or checking social media.\nKeep your audience and purpose in mind as you write. Your purpose will guide your mind as you compose your sentences.\nYour sense of your audience will guide word choice. For most college assignments, the audience is assumed to be an intelligent\ngeneral reader. It may help to imagine your classmates as your write. Keep asking yourself what your readers, with their\nbackground and experience, need to be told in order to understand. How can you best express your ideas so they are totally\nclear?\nPhoto by hannah grace on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing for Success, created by an author and publisher who prefer to remain anonymous, adapted\nand presented by the Saylor Foundation and licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\nThe section on fast drafting was adapted from English Composition: Connect, Collaborate, Communicate by Ann Inoshita,\nKaryl Garland, Kate Sims, Jeanne K.

This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts\u201d (21). Novelist\nVladimir Nabokov once said, \"I have rewritten\u2013often several times\u2013every word I have ever published. My pencils outlast their\nerasers.\"\nFor most writers, the process of writing and revision is the way we figure out exactly what we want to say. Writing helps us think.\nRevision can be one of the most important, instructive, and even pleasurable parts of the writing process. We respond to others\u2019\ncritiques and questions and watch the work transform into something stronger, clearer, and more persuasive. It may seem like a\nparadox, but the better we get at writing, the more time we will probably spend revising.\nMany people hear the words \u201ccritique\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d and pick up only negative vibes. However, a critique can energize us and\nmake us feel good about our writing. We can learn to be critical of ourselves in a constructive way and still feel good about\nourselves as writers. Critiques don\u2019t mean we\u2019ve done something wrong. It\u2019s better to see them as an opportunity to hear another\nperspective. Most well-regarded books include acknowledgments pages that thank all the people who gave feedback. The authors\nknow that getting feedback and making changes is a normal part of producing the best possible work.\nWhat Should We Prioritize in Revision?\nBy revision, we mean looking for ways to make ideas clearer and more convincing. When revising, we add, cut, move, or change\nwhole sentences or paragraphs. Revising is far more than just editing; it is really a re-vision of an entire essay: ideas, organization,\nand development.\nPhoto by Michael Burrows on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nIt\u2019s most efficient to revise from \u201cbig\u201d to \u201csmall.\u201d That is, we focus first on ideas and organization before turning our attention to\nsentence-level clarity. If we separate out these two stages, we won\u2019t waste time editing the grammar of sentences that we might\nlater have to change or cut.\nOnce we feel like we\u2019ve finished the content of the essay, we can move on to sentence-level editing. Then we take a second look at\nhow we expressed our ideas. We add or change words; fix problems in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure; and improve\nthe writing style. The goal is to turn out a polished piece of writing we feel proud of.\n11.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120094 Strategies for Getting Perspective\nOften the intense process of writing a draft leaves us feeling unsure where to begin revising. We may be too immersed in what we\nhave done to see what can be improved. Here are some revision strategies that writers use to get a fresh perspective on what they\nhave written:\nTake a break. Set aside your writing for a few hours or even a day until you can look at it objectively.\nPrint out a clean copy of the essay you plan to revise. Mark revision notes by hand and later use the printout to go back to the\ncomputer and make changes.\nRead your work aloud to yourself or a friend, or use a computer reader like NaturalReaders.com to listen to it. Often in\nlistening, we notice more things that we skip over when reading.\nAsk a tutor or someone you trust for feedback and constructive criticism.\nPretend you are one of your readers. Are you satisfied or dissatisfied? Why? Think of yourself as a translator whose job it is to\ntranslate your writing into clearer, more dynamic English.\nUse the tutoring resources that your college provides. Find out where your school\u2019s writing lab is located and ask about the\nassistance they provide online and in person.\nFour Ways to Approach Revision\n1. Focus on the Connections between Ideas\nOne way to revise is to look at the structure of the essay and see if it is solid. We want to make sure all of our points are related\nto the main point\u2014they unite to support the thesis. When a piece of writing has unity, all the ideas in each paragraph\u2014and in\nthe entire essay\u2014clearly belong, and the reader can see how each idea relates to the one before it. We can achieve this through\nreferring back, repeating key words and phrases, and using pointing and transition words. See 12.3: Showing How a New Idea\nFits in and 12.4: Referring Back to Make the Connection.\nOften when we are first trying to get something on paper, we may wander off topic, adding information that doesn\u2019t develop the\nmain idea. That\u2019s fine, as long as we catch it and correct it in revision. We can check each paragraph to make sure it helps\nprove the thesis. Then we can make sure the sentences in the paragraph support the topic sentence. Have we addressed the\nimportant ideas and questions that will come to readers\u2019 minds?\nDon't be afraid to delete material if you realize it is off topic. Alternately, you might see if you can reframe that material so it\nmore clearly connects to the thesis and the idea that came before it.\n2. Focus on Balancing \u201cThey Say\u201d and \u201cI Say\u201d\nAs we have seen in Chapter 4: Assessing the Strength of an Argument (Logos) and Chapter 5: Responding to an Argument:,\nmany college essays require both a summary of another text and a response to that text. In such essays, we aim for a balance of\nsummary and response, or \u201cthey say\u201d and \u201cI say.\u201d If you have been told or suspect that you need more sources to back up your\nclaims, or you need to give more of your own opinion, try this exercise:\nAssess How Much \u201cThey Say\u201d and \u201cI Say\u201d You Have:\n1. Take two different-colored highlighters.\n2. With your first highlighter color, highlight all the sentences in the body of the essay that summarize, paraphrase, or quote the\nideas of your source text.\n3. Now, take out highlighter color two. Go through and mark those passages containing your opinions, viewpoints, unique\nideas, or thoughts. Many students will find this color a bit underused, but others will notice too much color here if their\nessays lack source material.\n4. Take a moment to diagnose these disparate problems. Too much of one color means source overload\u2014too much \u201cthey say\u201d\nand not enough \u201cI say.\u201d Too much of the other color means empty opinion and guesswork\u2014too much \u201cI say,\u201d not backed up\nby \u201cthey say.\u201d Check your essay assignment to see if the teacher has given any guidance about how much of the essay\nshould be \u201cthey say\u201d and how much should be \u201cI say.\u201d Do you need to add more of one or the other?\nBring in More \u201cI Say,\u201d If Needed:\n1. Take one of your sources and read yourself a few paragraphs. After each major thought or idea, free-write a response in your\nown words: don\u2019t restate what the author says, respond honestly with your own opinionated, conversational response to\n11.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120094 what the source has just said. Pretend that you\u2019re talking face-to-face with the author, replying naturally.\n2. Once you feel you\u2019ve got sufficient conversation\/dialogue generated on paper, read your replies quietly to yourself, creating\nan actual conversation. Can you bring some of this \u201cdialogue\u201d into your essay? Strong essays should read like all the\nsources, including your analysis, are talking to each other.\n3. Repeat with any other source texts.\nBring in More \u201cThey Say,\u201d If Needed:\n1. Next, try the same with the highlighted source sections of your drafts. After each assessment or opinion you give, check to\nmake sure it is linked with corresponding ideas from your source texts.\n2. Pretend the author of the texts are speaking back to you. What would they have to say about your claims? Comb through\ntheir work and try to find instances in which they agreed, disagreed, or complicated your read and consider weaving it into\nthe text. If they offer a counter-argument then you might want to address it. If they reinforce your ideas, then you may have\nstrengthened your ideas.\n3. Repeat with any other source texts.\n3. Focus on the Thesis\n1. Find the essay\u2019s thesis statement, the one-sentence version of the whole essay. (Some teachers may allow for two-sentence\ntheses, but most commonly the thesis can be expressed in one sentence). If you cannot find it, read the whole essay, and\ncraft one.\n2. Does your thesis consist of a clear claim? Will readers know what you mean after reading that sentence alone? Imagine\nreading it to a friend. Would you want to change anything so they could understand it better?\n3. Does the thesis include or at least touch on all the ideas developed in the essay? If not, you may need to revise it so it covers\nmore.\n4. If the thesis is very general, consider ways to make it more specific. Whom does this apply to? When? Where? What are the\nclaim\u2019s implications? Look for generalizations, and replace them with specifics.\n4. Focus on Developing the Ideas\nIf your ideas don\u2019t feel fully developed or you\u2019re struggling to fill the page requirement, one approach is to go through each\nsentence of each paragraph to see what you need to add. For each paragraph, determine whether all the ideas included are\nsufficiently explained.\n1. Are all terms defined for the reader?\n2. Has each point been explained in enough detail?\n3. Have you given an example, quotation, or other specific information to support each point that needs it?\n4. Is there anything you mention that might well leave readers confused or asking questions?\n5. Is it clear how the paragraph relates to the previous paragraph and the thesis?\nRevise each under-developed paragraph to answer questions and provide a full picture for the reader. If a paragraph seems to be\ngetting long, consider whether it includes more than one important point. Often a paragraph on one topic can be split into two\nparagraphs, each on a subtopic. The transition can show how they are related.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from \u201cWriting, Reading, and College Success\u201d by Athena Kashyap and Erika Dyquisto, ASCCC Open\nEducational Resources Initiative, licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\nWorks Cited\nLamott, Anne. \u201cShitty First Drafts.\u201d Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life.

This task is usually called peer review, a\nconcept you will also learn about when you begin to use academic research. At first, this may seem intimidating. Writers may\nthink, \u201cI\u2019m not a teacher\u2013how can I give useful feedback to another writer?\u201d What writers can do is give their peers an honest\nreaction as a reader and give advice based on their own experience. It is ultimately up to the writer to decide if they want to make\nsure of the feedback given. If you feel unsure of your ability to give feedback, remember that you are learning from the process. In\na class, the other students will also receive feedback from the instructor.\nThis understanding may also help students who don\u2019t feel that other students are qualified to give feedback. If you feel that the\nadvice given to you by a peer isn\u2019t right, you can choose to ignore it or decide to check with your instructor first. Remember that\nyour peers are learning how to give feedback, just as you are.\nGiving feedback on writing is a powerful skill that you may use outside of school for work projects, for personal writing, or even to\nhelp your children with their homework.\nPhoto by Anna Tarazevich on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nGiving peer feedback\nWhen your role in peer review is to give feedback, your job is to help the writer by giving your reaction as a reader to the writing.\nThink about the kind of feedback you would like to get and also how you would like that feedback to be given. What follows here\nare some basic rules to follow for responding to someone else\u2019s writing.\nFirst, listen to the writer. What kind of feedback are they asking for? Do they want to know if their thesis is clear? Do they\nhave questions about citing sources? Make a note about what kind of feedback the writer has requested and keep that in mind as\nyou respond.\nBe kind. When you are receiving criticism, isn\u2019t it easier to hear if the person giving the criticism is kind and respectful to you?\nDo the same for your peer.\nComment on the higher-order concerns first. That means asking questions about anything that confuses you, checking to see\nif the writing did what the assignment called for, and considering if the order of the paper makes sense. Sometimes your\ninstructor will give you specific things they want you to comment on; if so, be sure you do so.\nUse \u201cI\u201d statements to help stay focused on your reaction to the writing. For example, instead of saying, \u201cYou aren\u2019t clear in\nthis paragraph,\u201d try saying, \u201cI\u2019m confused in this paragraph. Did you mean X or Y?\u201d\nBe specific. Never say \u201cI liked it\u201d or \u201cIt was good\u201d unless you follow up with an explanation of exactly what you liked or\nthought was good. The same goes for criticism; say exactly what confused you or what was missing.\nAsk questions. Use questions to clarify what the writer means, what the resources given are saying, and what the writer is\ntrying to do.\n11.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120095 Offer advice based on your own experience. For example, you could say \u201cif this were my paper, the two things I would do next\nare A and B.\u201d Provide options such as, \u201cIf you wanted to expand this, you could do A, B, or C.\u201d\nDon\u2019t try to make the writer sound like you. If a word is the wrong word, note that, but if you just think of a word you like\nbetter, that\u2019s just a matter of style and voice.\nDon\u2019t edit your peer\u2019s writing for them. Only comment on editing when the writing is a final draft or when your instructor\nhas included checking for errors in the instructions for peer review. Correcting errors is important at some point, but it makes no\nsense to spend time editing a paragraph if that paragraph may need to be deleted or changed. It\u2019s okay to remind the writer to\nrun spellcheck and grammar check if you notice minor errors. Otherwise, only ask about editing errors if you have trouble\nunderstanding the sentence because of the mistakes. If your instructor does want you to comment on errors, see Proofreading\nStrategies and be sure to follow the instructions.\nMake the most of peer feedback\nNow let\u2019s consider your role in receiving feedback, not giving it. Are you eager to get feedback? Scared to share your work? If you\nare receiving feedback from your peers, remember that ultimately you get to decide what feedback to accept. If you don\u2019t think the\nfeedback is correct, ask your instructor what they think. And give your peers a break; they are also just learning how to give\nfeedback.\nOne way to improve the feedback you get is to ask for the kind of feedback you want. Don\u2019t be afraid to give your peer reviewer\nsome direction.\nListen to or read the feedback with an open mind. Consider that the peer reviewer is your reader. It\u2019s good to know what a real\nreader got out of your writing.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure about the feedback or feel upset about it, reconsider the suggestions after a break. It\u2019s okay to say, \u201cI\u2019ll think\nabout that.\u201d If you feel that the reviewer is trying to change your style so that the paper doesn\u2019t sound like you anymore, consider\nwhether the feedback helps you make the paper better. If not, feel free to set that feedback aside.\nWhy meet with a writing tutor?\nSometimes your instructor may ask you to visit the Writing Center, or it may even be a requirement for your class. Or you may just\nbe curious about what a writing tutor has to offer. Many colleges have writing centers or subscribe to online services that provide\ntutoring in writing. What\u2019s the benefit?\nWriting tutors offer you another perspective on your writing. They serve as a real audience for your words and ideas. In addition to\nthat, they have some additional expertise either because they are more experienced writers or they are writing instructors. Writing\ntutors also have experience with resources for writing that you may not be aware of.\nConsider meeting with a tutor online if your college offers that option.\nPhoto by William Fortunato on Pexels under the Pexels License.\nPreparing to meet with a tutor\nTo prepare for a Writing Center session, print your paper out and consider printing a second copy to make it easier for both you and\nthe tutor to read along at the same time. Be ready to take notes and listen carefully. It\u2019s helpful if you bring the assignment or have\n11.7.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120095 access to it online. Your tutor will spend a few minutes in the beginning of the session figuring out what you are writing, what the\nrequirements are, and when your work is due. They may ask what you have already done to improve the writing, and they will\nalmost always ask you what you would like help with.\nKeep in mind that your tutor will want to focus on a few important things rather than try to catch every little thing in your paper.\nTutors won\u2019t edit your paper for you, but they can help you learn how to edit your own work better. Don\u2019t be surprised if your tutor\nshows you how to use a writing resource such as a handbook or the Purdue OWL online; part of the tutor\u2019s job is to help you learn\nto navigate resources on your own, so that you eventually have the same tools as the tutor.\nAt the end of a session, the tutor will probably ask you what you plan to do next with your writing. That\u2019s how they check to see\nthat you got what you needed from the session and that you understood the advice given. After you revise your writing, you may\nwant to schedule another tutoring session to work on additional aspects of the assignment.\nWhat about getting help from a friend or family member?\nGetting feedback from a reader outside of your class can sometimes be a good idea. If you want to ask a friend or family member\nfor feedback, set some ground rules. They should follow the same rules as a peer reviewer. At the very least, asking a friend or\nfamily member to read your paper aloud will help you hear how your paper sounds. You will probably catch more errors, too.\nPreparing for a student\/teacher conference\nGetting in-person help from your instructor is one of the best ways to receive feedback. You can prepare for a conference with your\ninstructor so that you get the most out of it. Usually, a conference happens with just you and your instructor. Friends aren\u2019t invited,\nand parents can only attend with your permission due to the Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act (FERPA). See this handy\nlink to \u201cFERPA General Guidance for Students\u201d from the US Department of Education (found at studentprivacy.ed.gov).\nBring your best work to the conference. The more effort you have already made means that the instructor won\u2019t waste time telling\nyou things you already know you need to fix. Re-read your work before the conference and prepare some questions. What do you\nthink is working? What do you need help with? During the conference, take notes. If the instructor writes anything down, ask if\nyou can take their notes with you. At the end of the conference, work with your instructor on an action plan to revise your work.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from The Word on College Reading and Writing by Carol Burnell, Jaime Wood, Monique Babin, Susan\nPesznecker, and Nicole Rosevear of Clackamas Community College and Portland State University, published\nby OpenOregon under a CC BY-NC license.\nThis page titled 11.7: Giving and Receiving Feedback is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by\nCarol Burnell, Jaime Wood, Monique Babin, Susan Pesznecker, and Nicole Rosevear (OpenOregon) via source content that was edited to the style\nand standards of the LibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\n11.7.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120095 CHAPTER OVERVIEW\n12: Essay Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nWrite a thesis that summarizes the main point of an essay\nWrite a topic sentence that summarizes the main point of a paragraph\nIntroduce relevant specific evidence to support a topic sentence\nIntegrate quotations and paraphrases from other texts as support\nConnect a new idea to a previous point or to the thesis\nIntroduce essays in ways that engage the reader in the specific topic\nConclude essays in ways that sum up as needed and point toward further questions or implications.\n12.1: Developing a Thesis Statement\n12.2: Topic Sentences\n12.3: Showing How a New Idea Fits in (Transitions)\n12.4: Referring Back to Make the Connection (Cohesion)\n12.5: Developing Paragraphs\n12.6: Quoting and Paraphrasing\n12.7: Introductions\n12.8: Conclusions\n\"Building Blocks\" is by Karl Abuid on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\n12: Essay Organization is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n1 12.1: Developing a Thesis Statement\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (9 min, 29 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 99::2299\nWhat is a thesis and why is it important?\nWe can think of a thesis statement as a very short version of the whole essay. If a friend asks us, \"What are you trying to say in your\nessay?\" the thesis should give the answer. It's like a signpost that signals the essay\u2019s destination. The essay itself explains, justifies,\nquestions, and elaborates on that thesis.\nAs to why we need a thesis, have you ever listened to someone talk and asked yourself, \"Where are they going with this? What's\nthe point?\" When we listen or when we read, we can take in multiple ideas if we know how they are related to an overall claim.\nOtherwise, we may be tempted to tune out.\nIn Chapter 2: Reading to Figure out the Argument, we practiced looking for main claims and supporting reasons as well as\ncounterarguments and limits. When we write our own essays, we want to make clear to readers what our main claim is and how\nour other points fit in.\nHow do I come up with a good thesis?\nA thesis is most commonly one sentence long and appears toward the end of the introduction. However, as our essays get longer\nand more complex, we may need two sentences to fully articulate the thesis. Check with your professor to see if they consider a\ntwo-sentence thesis legitimate and necessary in your case. In general, keeping the thesis short and stating it early will allow readers\nto easily grasp where the essay is going and how each paragraph relates. A strong thesis statement will have the following qualities:\nSpecific. A thesis statement must be precise enough to allow for a coherent argument and remain focused on the topic. For\nexample, health care is a broad topic, but a proper thesis statement would focus on a specific area of that topic, such as the\nlimited options for individuals without health care coverage.\nArguable. A thesis statement needs to be something that not everyone would immediately accept right away. A point of view or\njudgment about a topic is arguable and worth exploring in an essay. An established fact is not arguable.\nSupportable. For any claim we make in our thesis, we must be able to provide reasons and examples. We can rely on personal\nobservations in order to do this, or we can consult outside sources to demonstrate that what we assert is valid. A strong\nargument is backed by examples and details.\nIn essay assignments, teachers often provide a central question they want us to answer. That question can be our guide as we\ndevelop the thesis. The thesis can be our best answer to the question, an answer we can explain in more detail throughout the\nessay. If the teacher does not ask a question in the essay assignment, they may still describe a general topic. In that case, we can ask\nourselves, \u201cWhat do I want to say about this topic?\u201d We will discuss coming up with a topic for more open-ended essay\nassignments in Section 6.*: Focused Research Topics (link).\nOften as we write, we get a clearer idea of what it is we are ultimately trying to say, so we can revise the thesis as we go. Writing\nprocess strategies such as brainstorming, outlining, getting feedback, and revising will help us refine the thesis (Writing Process\nChapter reference and link).\nExamples of thesis statements\n1. Closing all American borders for a period of five years is one solution that will tackle illegal immigration.\n2. Compared to an absolute divorce, no-fault divorce is less expensive, promotes fairer settlements, and reflects a more realistic\nview of the causes for marital breakdown.\n3. Exposing children from an early age to the dangers of drug abuse is a sure method of preventing future drug addicts.\n4. In today\u2019s crumbling job market, a high school diploma is not significant enough education to land a stable, lucrative job.\n12.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120097 5. The societal and personal struggles of Troy Maxson in the play Fences symbolize the challenge of black males who lived\nthrough segregation and integration in the United States.\nHow can I improve a thesis?\n1. Check if it covers the ideas in the essay\nYour thesis will probably change as you write, so you will need to modify it to reflect exactly what you have discussed in your\nessay. Working thesis statements often become stronger as we gather information and form new opinions and reasons for those\nopinions. Revision helps us strengthen our thesis so that it matches what you have expressed in the body of the paper.\n2. Make it more specific\nReplace nonspecific words, such as people, everything, society, or life, with more precise words.\nWorking thesis: Young people have to work hard to succeed in life.\nRevised thesis: Recent college graduates must have discipline and persistence in order to find and maintain a stable job in\nwhich they can use and be appreciated for their talents.\nThe revised thesis makes a more specific statement about success and what it means to work hard. The original includes too\nbroad a range of people and does not define exactly what success entails. By replacing those general words like people and\nwork hard, the writer can better focus his or her research and gain more direction in his or her writing.\nAdd key information\nWe can ask ourselves the following questions to anticipate what readers will want to know.\nWorking thesis: Kansas City schoolteachers are not paid enough.\nWho is not paying the teachers enough?\nWhat is considered \u201cenough\u201d? Why?\nHow do the low salaries of teachers affect the overall functioning of a school?\nRevised thesis: The Kansas City legislature cannot afford to pay its educators, resulting in job cuts and resignations in a\ndistrict that sorely needs highly qualified and dedicated teachers\n3. Clarify an idea\nWhat might readers be confused about after they read the thesis? What basic questions will they have about the meaning of the\nthesis? We can revise to make the answers clear.\nWorking thesis: The welfare system is a joke.\nA joke means many things to many people. Readers bring all sorts of backgrounds and perspectives to the reading process and\nwould need clarification for a word so vague. This expression may also be too informal for the selected audience. By asking\nquestions, the writer can devise a more precise and appropriate explanation for joke.\nRevised thesis: The welfare system keeps a socioeconomic class from gaining employment by alluring members of that class\nwith unearned income, instead of programs to improve their education and skill sets.\nWorking thesis: Today\u2019s teenage girls are too sexualized.\nIt is true that some young women in today\u2019s society are more sexualized than in the past, but that is not true for all girls. The\nwriter of this thesis should ask the following questions:\nWhich teenage girls?\nWhat constitutes \u201ctoo\u201d sexualized?\nAre we talking about the girls' behavior or the way other people view them, or both?\nWhat is causing this?\nWhy does it matter? What are the repercussions?\nRevised thesis: Teenage girls who are captivated by the sexual images on MTV are conditioned to believe that a woman\u2019s\nworth depends on her sexual attractiveness, a feeling that harms their self-esteem and behavior.\n12.1.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120097 Exercise 12.1.2\nRead the following thesis statements. Choose three that need improvement and revise them. Explain why each revision is\nbetter.\n1. The subject of this paper is my experience with ferrets as pets.\n2. The government must expand its funding for research on renewable energy resources in order to prepare for the impending\nend of oil.\n3. Edgar Allan Poe was a poet who lived in Baltimore during the nineteenth century.\n4. There are many reasons why slot machines should not be legalized in Baltimore.\n5. Despite his promises during his campaign, President Kennedy took few executive measures to support civil rights\nlegislation.\n6. Because many children\u2019s toys have potential safety hazards that could lead to injury, it is clear that not all children\u2019s toys\nare safe.\n7. My experience with young children has taught me that I want to be a disciplinary parent because I believe that a child\nwithout discipline can be a parent\u2019s worst nightmare.\nAttributions\nSome sections of the above are original content by Anna Mills and others are adapted by Anna Mills from the following:\nWriting for Success, created by an author and publisher who prefer to remain anonymous, adapted and presented by the Saylor\nFoundation and licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\nSuccessful College Composition, also licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, which was itself adapted from Writing for Success.\n12.1: Developing a Thesis Statement is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n12.1.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120097 12.2: Topic Sentences\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (11 min, 10 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1111::1100\nWhat is a topic sentence and why is it useful?\nImagine reading one long block of text, with each idea blurring into the next. We are likely to lose interest in writing that is\ndisorganized and spans many pages without breaks. Paragraphs separate ideas into logical, manageable chunks. By exploring one\nidea at a time, the writer has a chance to explain and support that idea. The reader can then digest the idea before moving on to the\nnext, related paragraph.\nA topic sentence is a sentence that summarizes the main idea of a paragraph, just as a thesis summarizes a whole essay. As the\nunifying sentence for the paragraph, the topic sentence is the most general, whereas other, supporting sentences provide more\nspecific information, such as facts, details, or examples.\nEach topic sentence should clearly relate to the essay's thesis. We will talk more about how to make that connection in the next\nsections, 12.3: Showing How a New Idea Fits in (Transitions) and 12.4: Referring Back to Make the Connection (Cohesion).\nPhoto by Pixabay from Pexels under the Pexels License.\nWhat makes a good topic sentence?\nThe goal of a topic sentence is to help readers focus on and remember the main idea of the paragraph. So the trick is to write a\nsentence that covers all the points of the paragraph but does not cram in too many words or details. We want to give a sense of\nwhat the paragraph will contain without listing all the specifics.\nExample 12.2.1\nVague topic sentence: \"First, we need a better way to educate students.\"\nExplanation: The claim is vague because it does not provide enough information about what will follow, and it is too broad to\nbe covered effectively in one paragraph.\nRevised version: \"Creating a national set of standards for math and English education will improve student learning in many\nstates.\"\nExplanation: The sentence replaces the vague phrase \u201ca better way\u201d and leads readers to expect supporting facts and examples\nas to why standardizing education in these subjects might improve student learning in many states.\n12.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120098 In addition, we want to make sure that the topic sentence gets right to the point. A good topic sentence is clear and easy to follow.\nExample 12.2.2\nConfusing topic sentence: \"In general, writing an essay, thesis, or other academic or nonacademic document is considerably\neasier and of much higher quality if you first construct an outline, of which there are many different types.\"\nExplanation: The convoluted sentence structure and unnecessary vocabulary bury the main idea, making it difficult for the\nreader to follow the topic sentence.\nRevised version: Most forms of writing can be improved by first creating an outline.\nExplanation: This topic sentence cuts out unnecessary verbiage and simplifies the previous statement, making it easier for the\nreader to follow. The writer can include examples of what kinds of writing can benefit from outlining in the supporting\nsentences.\nWhere should I put a topic sentence?\nIn academic writing, the topic sentence is usually the first sentence or second sentence of a paragraph and expresses its main idea,\nfollowed by supporting sentences that help explain, prove, or enhance the topic sentence. In most college essays, placing an explicit\ntopic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph (the first or second sentence) makes it easier for readers to follow the essay and\nfor writers to stay on topic.\nHowever, ultimately what matters is whether the reader can easily pick up on the main idea of the paragraph. Sometimes,\nespecially in narrative or creative writing, a writer may choose to build up to the topic sentence or even leave it implied. The\nfollowing examples illustrate varying locations for the topic sentence. In each example, the topic sentence is underlined.\nTopic Sentence Begins the Paragraph (General to Specific)\nParagraphs that begin with the topic sentence move from the general to the specific. They open with a general statement about a\nsubject and then discuss specific examples. This is the common pattern for most academic essays.\nAfter reading the new TV guide this week I wondered why we are still being bombarded\nwith reality shows, a plague that continues to darken our airwaves. Along with the return\nof viewer favorites, we are to be cursed with yet another mindless creation. Prisoner\nfollows the daily lives of eight suburban housewives who have chosen to be put in jail for\nthe purposes of this fake psychological experiment. A preview for the first episode shows\nthe usual tears and tantrums associated with reality television. I dread to think what\nproducers will come up with next season and hope that other viewers will express their\ncriticism. These producers must stop the constant stream of meaningless shows without\nplotlines. We\u2019ve had enough reality television to last us a lifetime!\nHere, the first sentence tells readers that the paragraph will be about reality television shows, and it expresses the writer\u2019s distaste\nfor these shows through the use of the word bombarded. Each of the following sentences in the paragraph supports the topic\nsentence by providing further information about a specific reality television show and why the writer finds it unappealing. The final\nsentence is the concluding sentence. It reiterates the main point that viewers are bored with reality television shows by using\ndifferent words from the topic sentence.\nTopic Sentence Ends the Paragraph (Specific to General)\nSometimes, especially in persuasive writing, we might want to save the general statement for last, when we have given enough\nsupporting details to convince the reader. If we build up to the topic sentence, then the reader might feel they are coming to the\nconclusion along with us. The risk is that the reader will want to know sooner where the paragraph is going.\nIn the paragraph below, the topic sentence comes last. Specific examples, a cat that tracked down its owners and a dog that can\npredict seizures, prepare us for the general conclusion: animals\u2019 senses are better than humans\u2019.\n12.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120098 Last year, a cat traveled 130 miles to reach its family, who had moved to another state\nand had left their pet behind. Even though it had never been to their new home, the cat\nwas able to track down its former owners. A dog in my neighborhood can predict when its\nmaster is about to have a seizure. It makes sure that he does not hurt himself during an\nepileptic fit. Compared to many animals, our own senses are almost dull.\nTopic Sentence in the Middle of the Paragraph\nOccasionally, a writer might choose to hook the reader or introduce a concept before giving the topic sentence in the middle of the\nparagraph. In the paragraph below, the underlined topic sentence expresses the main idea\u2014that breathing exercises can help control\nanxiety. The preceding sentences enable the writer to build up to their main point by using a personal anecdote. The supporting\nsentences then expand on how breathing exercises help the writer by providing additional information. The concluding sentence\nrestates how breathing can help manage anxiety.\nFor many years, I suffered from severe anxiety every time I took an exam. Hours before\nthe exam, my heart would begin pounding, my legs would shake, and sometimes I would\nbecome physically unable to move. Last year, I was referred to a specialist and finally\nfound a way to control my anxiety\u2014breathing exercises. It seems so simple, but by doing\njust a few breathing exercises a couple of hours before an exam, I gradually got my\nanxiety under control. The exercises help slow my heart rate and make me feel less\nanxious. Better yet, they require no pills, no equipment, and very little time. It\u2019s amazing\nhow just breathing correctly has helped me learn to manage my anxiety symptoms.\nNote\nIf you notice that you have used a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph in an academic essay, read through the paragraph\ncarefully to make sure that it contains only one major topic.\nImplied Topic Sentences\nSome well-organized paragraphs do not contain a topic sentence at all, a technique often used in descriptive and narrative writing.\nInstead of being directly stated, the main idea is implied in the content of the paragraph, as in the following narrative paragraph:\nHeaving herself up the stairs, Luella had to pause for breath several times. She let out a\nwheeze as she sat down heavily in the wooden rocking chair. Tao approached her\ncautiously, as if she might crumble at the slightest touch. He studied her face, like\nparchment, stretched across the bones so finely he could almost see right through the skin\nto the decaying muscle underneath. Luella smiled a toothless grin.\nAlthough no single sentence in this paragraph states the main idea, the entire paragraph focuses on one concept\u2014that Luella is\nextremely old. All the details in the paragraph can work together to convey the dominant impression of Luella\u2019s age. In a paragraph\nsuch as this one, an explicit topic sentence such as \"Luella was very old\" would seem awkward and heavy-handed. Implied topic\nsentences work well if the writer has a firm idea of what he or she intends to say in the paragraph and sticks to it. One risk is that an\nimplied topic sentence may be too subtle for the reader to catch.\nExercise 12.2.1\nIn each of the following sentence pairs, choose the more effective topic sentence and explain what makes it better.\n1. a. This paper will discuss the likelihood of the Democrats winning the next election.\nb. To boost their chances of winning the next election, the Democrats need to listen to public opinion.\n2. a. The unrealistic demands of union workers are crippling the economy for three main reasons.\nb. Union workers are crippling the economy because companies are unable to remain competitive as a result of added\nfinancial pressure.\n12.2.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120098 3. a. Authors are losing money as a result of technological advances.\nb. The introduction of new technology will devastate the literary world.\n4. a. Rap music is produced by untalented individuals with oversized egos.\nb. This essay will consider whether talent is required in the rap music industry.\nAttributions\nSome sections of the above are original content by Anna Mills and others are adapted from the following sources:\nWriting for Success, created by an author and publisher who prefer to remain anonymous, adapted and presented by the Saylor\nFoundation and licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\nSuccessful College Composition, also licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, which was itself adapted from Writing for Success.\n12.2: Topic Sentences is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n12.2.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120098 12.3: Showing How a New Idea Fits in (Transitions)\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (10 min, 47 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1100::4477\nAs we develop our own arguments in longer papers in college, we get more choices about what to put in and in what order. Adding\nlength and complexity poses a risk. How do we make sure readers don't lose the thread of what we're saying? How do we start a\nnew paragraph so that readers will know why it comes next and how it fits into the overall argument? For that matter, how do we\nmove from sentence to sentence so that the reader sees the connection between one supporting idea and the next?\nA caution about transition words\nSome writing teachers focus on encouraging students to use transition words like \u201chowever,\u201d and \u201ctherefore.\u201d As we have seen in\nthe templates above, such words can definitely help show a connection. They are only useful, though, if they really reflect the\nrelationship between the previous idea and the next. As writers, we may be tempted to rely too much on a transition word without\nthinking through the connection fully. The final test is whether the reader understands the connection between new and old ideas.\nSome transition words do not tell us anything about how the previous idea relates to the next one. Be wary of \u201cin addition,\u201d\n\u201cmoreover,\u201d \u201calso,\u201d etc. , They tell us that a new idea is coming, but not much else. We can use them if we also highlight the\nconnection to the previous idea through a repeated key concept. Similarly, the phrases \u201cin conclusion\u201d and \u201cto conclude\u201d don\u2019t help\nthe reader see how the previous paragraphs have been building up to the final point. We can still use them if we make sure that the\nrest of the words show how your final thoughts grow out of the paragraphs that come before (see the section on conclusions for\nmore on how to do that).\nThe benefits of clarifying the connections\nProviding a clear sense of the connection between one idea and the next can be one of the most challenging parts of the writing\nprocess. Don\u2019t worry if it doesn\u2019t come naturally; for most people it requires mental sweat and revision. Even if we have already\ndone an outline, there will be more to figure out as we face the start of a new paragraph. Ultimately, though, hitting upon the right\nway to link our ideas can be one of the most satisfying moments in the writing process. Everything falls into place. When we do\nmanage to clarify that connection, we can relax and readers can relax as they follow the argument\u2019s flow from one point to the\nnext.\nWhat role does the next idea play in the argument?\nIf we map out an argument, as we did in Chapter 2 of this book, arrows show when a reason supports a claim. Labels like\n\u201ccounterargument\u201d or \u201climit\u201d show how one idea modifies or responds to another. When we write our own arguments, though, we\nneed words to stand in for these visual cues. Phrases can signal to readers how a new paragraph or sentence fits into the overall\nstructure. In Chapters 2 and 3 when we talked about reading and summarizing, we looked for typical phrases that signal a reason, a\ncounterargument, a limit, or a rebuttal. Now we can use many of these same phrases to guide our readers through our own\narguments.\nParadoxically, the first step toward writing a good transition sentence can be to remind ourselves of the point we have just made. If\nwe can formulate that point in a simple phrase, we can focus better on the nature of the connection. How does the new idea relate to\nthat previous claim? Below are some possible ways it might connect along with accompanying phrases.\nA reason for the previous claim\n_________ because _________.\n_________ is a result of _________.\nThe reason for _________ lies in _________.\n_________ causes this _________.\n12.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120099 _________ happens because _________.\nWe see the cause of _________ in _________.\nWhy does _________ happen?

We remind the reader of\nthe old and put it into relationship with the new. But how do we reference ideas we\u2019ve already covered without repeating ad\nnauseum?\nImage by Tumisu from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nRepetition\nRepetition sounds like something boring we are supposed to avoid, but is actually essential to cohesion. Repeating a short key\nphrase can link two sentences or paragraphs by showing what topic they have in common. If we find we are using a particular\nphrase too much, we can vary the wording without changing the concept. As an example, imagine we want to prove the following\nthesis:\nEconomic inequality in America will only increase unless the government takes the excess\npossessions of the ultra-rich.\nWe can be pretty sure we\u2019ll need to repeat the key phrase \u201ceconomic inequality\u201d in ensuing paragraphs or substitute variations like\n\u201cinequality,\u201d \u201ceconomic stratification\u201d or \u201cthe disparity between rich and poor,\u201d to remind readers of our central idea. That will\nallow us to suggest the causes of inequality, define the extent of inequality, and make predictions about future inequality without\nseeming like we are jumping from one random point to another.\nIf we think the reader may not remember what we are referring to, or if its complexity makes it worth summing up, we might need\nto briefly restate an idea. We can paraphrase and condense a point made in a previous paragraph into just a few words. Often\nlooking at a previous topic sentence can help us focus on the key idea and describe the heart of it.\nPointing words\nIn order to remind the reader that we have already discussed an idea, we can use what Graff and Birkenstein call pointing\nwords like \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthat.\u201d These combine with the repeated phrase or concept to work like an arrow pointing back to a section of\na previous paragraph. For example, we might use the phrase \u201cthis growing inequity\u201d or \u201cthat very economic inequality.\u201d The\nwords \"this\" and \"that\" reassure readers they can go back and look up the earlier idea if needed.\nAbstract nouns\nTo make the reference to the prior idea clear, we can couple \"this\u201d or \u201cthat\" with an abstract noun, or a word that represents the\nkind of idea we are talking about. You may also see these referred to as anaphoric nouns or shell nouns.\n12.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120100 Below are a few common abstract nouns that can refer back to an established idea. There are many others. As you'll notice, the\nfirst few refer to elements of an argument.\nreason \/ evidence\nclaim\nfact\nargument\nfindings \/ conclusion\npurpose\ncause \/ factor\neffect \/ result \/ consequence\nidea \/ concept\nsubject \/ issue \/ topic\nphenomenon\nproblem \/ challenge \/ difficulty\nsolution\nfeature \/ characteristic \/ aspect\nmethod \/ technique \/ strategy \/ approach \/ way \/ manner\ntendency \/ trend \/ pattern\nExamples of these connection techniques\nHere is an example template that combines repetition, a pointing word, \"this,\" and an abstract noun, \"idea\":\nAs we have seen, _____________. This idea has implications for _____________.\nLet's look at a more extended example. Say that we want to write about inequality in the early 21st century. The topic stays the\nsame, and the time period changes. First we give some history about the late 1800s. Then we describe how inequality changed\nover time, and we want to start a paragraph about the Occupy Wall Street movement that started in 2011. What is the connection\nbetween an old idea and a new idea? We might decide that Occupy Wall Street was a direct result of inequality and start the\nparagraph thus:\nThe increased inequality that became obvious after the 2007 financial crisis eventually\nled to a backlash. In September 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protest trumpeted the cause\nof the \u201c99%\u201d of Americans who were left out while the top 1% enjoyed most of the profits\nof American capitalism.\nThe new paragraph thus points back to the cause and ahead to the effect, signaling this causal relationship with the word \u201cled.\u201d\nNote that the phrase \u201cincreased inequality\u201d refers to a core topic of the overall argument, and the phrase \u201cthat became obvious after\nthe 2007 financial crisis\u201d reminds us of the concept developed in the previous paragraph.\nPractice Exercise 12.4.1\nChoose one of the sample annotated essays contained in this textbook. Go through it and circle any repetition, pointing words,\nor abstract nouns that refer back to an idea. Draw an arrow from each referring word back to the earlier part of the essay it\nrefers to. How do these words help make the essay more cohesive and easier to follow for you as a reader?

Supporting sentences can explain, prove, or\nenhance the idea in the topic sentence. For example, in a persuasive essay about raising the wage for certified nursing assistants, a\nparagraph might focus on the expectations and duties of the job, comparing them to that of a registered nurse. Needless to say, a\nsingle topic sentence that lists the certified nursing assistant\u2019s duties will not give readers a complete enough idea of what these\nhealthcare professionals do. If readers do not have plenty of information about the duties and the writer\u2019s experience in performing\nthem for what she considers inadequate pay, the paragraph fails to do its part in convincing readers that the pay is inadequate and\nshould be increased.\nA paragraph, like a column, needs support in the middle. Image by Monika Grafik from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nIn informative or persuasive writing, a supporting sentence usually offers one of the following:\nFact: Many families now rely on older relatives to support them financially.\nStatistic: Nearly 10 percent of adults are currently unemployed in the United States.\nQuotation: \u201cWe will not allow this situation to continue,\u201d stated Senator Johns.\nAnecdote or example: Last year, Bill was asked to retire at the age of fifty-five.\nThe type of supporting sentence you choose will depend on what you are writing and why you are writing. For example, if you are\nattempting to persuade your audience to take a particular position, you should rely on facts, statistics, and concrete examples, rather\nthan personal opinions. Personal testimony in the form of an extended example can be used in conjunction with the other types of\nsupport. Let's look at a sample paragraph as a list of all the elements we've just discussed, plus a concluding sentence, which we'll\ndiscuss below.\nTopic sentence: There are numerous advantages to owning a hybrid car.\nSentence 1 (statistic): First, they get 20 percent to 35 percent more miles to the gallon than a fuel-efficient gas-powered vehicle.\nSentence 2 (fact): Second, they produce very few emissions during low-speed city driving.\nSentence 3 (reason): Because they do not require gas, hybrid cars reduce dependency on fossil fuels, which helps lower prices at\nthe pump.\nSentence 4 (example): Alex bought a hybrid car two years ago and has been extremely impressed with its performance.\nSentence 5 (quotation): \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest car I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said. \u201cThe running costs are far lower than previous gas powered\nvehicles I\u2019ve owned.\u201d\n12.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120101 Concluding sentence: Given the low running costs and environmental benefits of owning a hybrid car, it is likely that many more\npeople will follow Alex\u2019s example in the near future.\nConcluding Sentences\nParagraphs do not necessarily need concluding sentences. However, a concluding sentence can help if you think your readers need\na reminder of what the main point was or what we have learned from the paragraph. If the material in the paragraph taken together\nseems to logically imply an idea, we can name that idea in the concluding sentence. This might take the form of a prediction,\nsuggestion, or recommendation about the information in the paragraph. For example, a paragraph on childhood obesity might\nconclude, \"These statistics indicate that unless we take action, childhood obesity rates will continue to rise.\"\nSometimes it seems as if all sentences in a paragraph point toward the concluding sentence.\nImage by Ryan McGuire from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nIf we repeat the main point, we should express it in different words to avoid sounding too repetitive. For example, let's compare the\ntopic sentence and concluding sentence from the first example on hybrid cars:\nTopic Sentence: There are many advantages to owning a hybrid car.\nConcluding Sentence: Given the low running costs and environmental benefits of owning a hybrid car, it is likely that many more\npeople will follow Alex\u2019s example in the near future.\nNotice the use of the synonyms advantages and benefits. The concluding sentence reiterates the idea that owning a hybrid is\nadvantageous without using the exact same words. It also summarizes two examples of the advantages covered in the supporting\nsentences: low running costs and environmental benefits.\nNote\nWriters should avoid introducing any new ideas into a concluding sentence because a conclusion is intended to provide the\nreader with a sense of completion. Introducing a subject that is not covered in the paragraph will confuse readers.\nParagraph Length\nWriters often want to know how many words a paragraph should contain. There is no set number; a paragraph needs to develop an\nidea enough to satisfy the writer and readers. Paragraphs can vary in length from one or two sentences, to over a page; however, in\nmost college assignments, successfully developed paragraphs usually contain one hundred to two hundred and fifty words and span\none-fourth to two-thirds of a typed page.\nParagraphs, like pencils, can be of varying lengths.\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nIf a paragraph is over a page long, consider providing a paragraph break for readers. Look for a logical place to divide the\nparagraph; then revise the opening sentence of the second paragraph to maintain coherence.\n12.5.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120101 Occasionally a short paragraph may serve to emphasize an idea, but a series of short paragraphs can be confusing and choppy.\nExamine the content of the paragraphs and combine ones with related ideas or develop each one further.\nExercise 12.5.1\nConsider the paragraph below on the topic of trauma in novelist J. D. Salinger\u2019s work. Identify the topic sentence\nand supporting points. Some of the supporting points may be more than one sentence each.

Novice writers sometimes inadvertently misrepresent their sources when they quote very minor\npoints from an article or even positions that the authors of an article disagree with. It often happens when students approach their\nsources with the goal of finding snippets that align with their own opinion. For example, the passage above contains the phrase\n\u201cmeasuring teachers\u2019 performance by student test scores is the best way to improve education.\u201d An inexperienced writer might\ninclude that quote in a paper without making it clear that the author(s) of the source actually dispute that very claim. Doing so is\nnot intentionally fraudulent, but it reveals that the paper-writer isn\u2019t really thinking about and responding to claims and arguments\nmade by others. In that way, it harms his or her credibility.\nAcademic journal articles are especially likely to be misrepresented by student writers because their literature review sections often\nsummarize a number of contrasting viewpoints. For example, sociologists Jennifer C. Lee and Jeremy Staff wrote a paper in which\nthey note that high-schoolers who spend more hours at a job are more likely to drop out of school.1 However, Lee and Staff\u2019s\nanalysis finds that working more hours doesn\u2019t actually make a student more likely to drop out. Instead, the students who express\nless interest in school are both more likely to work a lot of hours and more likely to drop out. In short, Lee and Staff argue that\ndisaffection with school causes students to drop-out, not working at a job. In reviewing prior research about the impact of work on\ndropping out, Lee and Staff write \u201cPaid work, especially when it is considered intensive, reduces grade point averages, time spent\non homework, educational aspirations, and the likelihood of completing high school\u201d2. If you included that quote without\nexplaining how it fits into Lee and Staff\u2019s actual argument, you would be misrepresenting that source.\nProvide context\nAnother error beginners often make is to drop in a quote without any context. If you simply quote, \u201cStudents begin preschool with\na set of self-regulation skills that are a product of their genetic inheritance and their family environment\u201d (Willingham, 2011, p.24),\nyour reader is left wondering who Willingham is, why he or she is included here, and where this statement fits into his or her larger\nwork. The whole point of incorporating sources is to situate your own insights in the conversation. As part of that, you should\nprovide some kind of context the first time you use that source. Some examples:\nWillingham, a cognitive scientist, claims that \u2026\nResearch in cognitive science has found that \u2026 (Willingham, 2011).\nWillingham argues that \u201cStudents begin preschool with a set of self-regulation skills that are a product of their genetic\ninheritance and their family environment\u201d (Willingham, 2011, 24). Drawing on findings in cognitive science, he explains\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAs the first example above shows, providing a context doesn\u2019t mean writing a brief biography of every author in your bibliography\n\u2014it just means including some signal about why that source is included in your text.\nQuoted material that does not fit into the flow of the text baffles the reader even more. For example, a novice student might write,\nSchools and parents shouldn\u2019t set limits on how much teenagers are allowed to work at\njobs. \u201cWe conclude that intensive work does not affect the likelihood of high school\n12.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120102 dropout among youths who have a high propensity to spend long hours on the job\u201d (Lee\nand Staff, 2007, p. 171). Teens should be trusted to learn how to manage their time.\nThe reader is thinking, who is this sudden, ghostly \u201cwe\u201d? Why should this source be believed? If you find that passages with quotes\nin your draft are awkward to read out loud, that\u2019s a sign that you need to contextualize the quote more effectively. Here\u2019s a version\nthat puts the quote in context:\nSchools and parents shouldn\u2019t set limits on how much teenagers are allowed to work at\njobs. Lee and Staff\u2019s carefully designed study found that \u201cintensive work does not affect\nthe likelihood of high school dropout among youths who have a high propensity to spend\nlong hours on the job\u201d (2007, p. 171). Teens should be trusted to learn how to manage\ntheir time.\nIn this latter example, it\u2019s now clear that Lee and Staff are scholars and that their empirical study is being used as evidence for this\nargumentative point. Using a source in this way invites the reader to check out Lee and Staff\u2019s work for themselves if they doubt\nthis claim.\nMany writing instructors encourage their students to contextualize their use of sources by making a \u201cquotation sandwich\u201d; that is,\nintroduce the quote in some way and then follow it up with your own words. If you\u2019ve made a bad habit of dropping in\nunintroduced quotes, the quotation sandwich idea may help you improve your skills, but in general you don\u2019t need to approach\nevery quote or paraphrase as a three-part structure to have well-integrated sources. You should, however, avoid ending a paragraph\nwith a quotation. If you\u2019re struggling to figure out what to write after a quote or close paraphrase, it may be that you haven\u2019t yet\nfigured out what role the quote is playing in your own analysis. If that happens to you a lot, try writing the whole first draft in your\nown words and then incorporate material from sources as you revise with \u201cThey Say\/I Say\u201d in mind.\nUse sources efficiently\nSome student writers are in a rut of only quoting whole sentences. Some others, like myself as a student, get overly enamored of\nextended block quotes and the scholarly look they give to the page.7 These aren\u2019t the worst sins of academic writing, but they get in\nthe way of one of the key principles of writing with sources: shaping quotes and paraphrases efficiently. Efficiency follows from\nthe second principle, because when you fully incorporate sources into your own explicit argument, you zero in on the phrases,\npassages, and ideas that are relevant to your points. It\u2019s a very good sign for your paper when most quotes are short (key terms,\nphrases, or parts of sentences) and the longer quotes (whole sentences and passages) are clearly justified by the discussion in which\nthey\u2019re embedded. Every bit of every quote should feel indispensable to the paper. An overabundance of long quotes usually means\nthat your own argument is undeveloped. The most incandescent quotes will not hide that fact from your professor.\nAlso, some student writers forget that quoting is not the only way to incorporate sources. Paraphasing and summarizing are\nsophisticated skills that are often more appropriate to use than direct quoting. The first two paragraphs of the example passage\nabove do not include any quotations, even though they are both clearly focused on presenting the work of others. Student writers\nmay avoid paraphrasing out of fear of plagiarizing, and it\u2019s true that a poorly executed paraphrase will make it seem like the student\nwriter is fraudulently claiming the wordsmithing work of others as his or her own. Sticking to direct quotes seems safer. However,\nit is worth your time to master paraphasing because it often helps you be more clear and concise, drawing out only those elements\nthat are relevant to the thread of your analysis.\nFor example, here\u2019s a passage from a hypothetical paper with a block quote that is fully relevant to the argument but, nevertheless,\ninefficient:\nDrawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman concludes our brains are prone to\nerror:\nSystem 1 registers the cognitive ease with which it\nprocesses information, but it does not generate a\nwarning signal when it becomes unreliable. Intuitive\n12.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120102 answers come to mind quickly and confidently,\nwhether they originate from skills or from heuristics.\nThere is no simple way for System 2 to distinguish\nbetween a skilled and a heuristic response. Its only\nrecourse is to slow down and attempt to construct\nan answer on its own, which it is reluctant to do\nbecause it is indolent. Many suggestions of System\n1 are casually endorsed with minimal checking, as\nin the bat-and-ball problem.\nWhile people can get better at recognizing and avoiding these errors, Kahneman\nsuggests, the more robust solutions involve developing procedures within\norganizations to promote careful, effortful thinking in making important decisions\nand judgments.\nEven a passage that is important to reference and is well contextualized in the flow of the paper will be inefficient if it introduces\nterms and ideas that aren\u2019t central to the analysis within the paper. Imagine, for example, that other parts of this hypothetical paper\nuse Kahneman\u2019s other terms for System 1 (fast thinking) and System 2 (slow thinking); the sudden encounter of \u201cSystem 1\u201d and\n\u201cSystem 2\u201d would be confusing and tedious for your reader. Similarly, the terms \u201cheuristics\u201d and \u201cbat-and-ball problem\u201d might be\nunfamiliar to your reader. Their presence in the block quote just muddies the waters. In this case, a paraphrase is a much better\nchoice. Here\u2019s an example passage that uses a paraphrase to establish the same points more clearly and efficiently:\nDrawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman summarizes that our brains are prone to\nerror because they necessarily rely on cognitive shortcuts that may or may not yield valid\njudgments.4 We have the capacity to stop and examine our assumptions, Kahneman points\nout, but we often want to avoid that hard work. As a result, we tend to accept our quick,\nintuitive responses. While people can get better at recognizing and avoiding these errors,\nKahneman suggests that the more robust solutions involve developing procedures within\norganizations to promote careful, effortful thinking in making important decisions and\njudgments.\nNot only is the paraphrased version shorter (97 words versus 151), it is clearer and more efficient because it highlights the key\nideas, avoiding specific terms and examples that aren\u2019t used in the rest of the paper. If other parts of your paper did refer to\nKahneman\u2019s System 1 and System 2, then you might choose to include some quoted phrases to make use of some of Kahneman\u2019s\ngreat language. Perhaps something like this:\nDrawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman summarizes that our brains are prone to\nerror because they necessarily rely on cognitive shortcuts that may or may not yield valid\njudgments.5 System 1, Kahneman explains, \u201cdoes not generate a warning signal when it\nbecomes unreliable.\u201d 6 System 2 can stop and examine these assumptions, but it usually\nwants to avoid that hard work. As a result, our quick, intuitive responses are \u201ccasually\nendorsed with minimal checking.\u201d 7 While people can get better at recognizing and\navoiding these errors, Kahneman suggests, the more robust solutions involve developing\nprocedures within organizations to promote careful, effortful thinking in making important\ndecisions and judgments.\n12.6.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120102 Whether you choose a long quote, short quote, paraphrase or summary depends on the role that the source is playing in your\nanalysis. The trick is to make deliberate, thoughtful decisions about how to incorporate ideas and words from others.\nParaphrasing, summarizing, and the mechanical conventions of quoting take a lot of practice to master. Numerous other resources\n(like those listed at the end of this chapter) explain these practices clearly and succinctly. Bookmark some good sources and refer to\nthem as needed.

A conclusive one (\u201cdetermines\u201d)?\nA controversial one (\u201ccounters\u201d)? You can further show how you\u2019re incorporating these sources into your own narrative. For\nexample, if you write that an author \u201cclaims\u201d something, you\u2019re presenting yourself as fairly neutral about that claim.

The five-paragraph format that most students mastered before coming to college suggests\nthat introductory paragraphs should start very general and gradually narrow down to the thesis. As a result, students frequently\nwrite introductions for college papers in which the first two or three (or more) sentences are patently obvious or overly broad.\nCharitable and well-rested instructors just skim over that text and start reading closely when they arrive at something substantive.\nFrustrated and overtired instructors emit a dramatic self-pitying sigh, assuming that the whole paper will be as lifeless and gassy as\nthose first few sentences. If you\u2019ve gotten into the habit of beginning opening sentences with the following phrases, firmly resolve\nto strike them from your repertoire right now:\nIn today\u2019s world \u2026\nThroughout human history \u2026\nSince the dawn of time \u2026\nWebster\u2019s Dictionary defines [CONCEPT] as \u2026\nFor one thing, sentences that begin with the first three stems are often wrong. For example, someone may write, \u201cSince the dawn of\ntime, people have tried to increase crop yields.\u201d In reality, people have not been trying to increase crop yields throughout human\nhistory\u2014agriculture is only about 23,000 years old, after all\u2014and certainly not since the dawn of time (whenever that was). For\nanother, sentences that start so broadly, even when factually correct, could not possibly end with anything interesting.\nSometimes we know that more precise and vivid intros and conclusions are ideal but still settle on the vague language that seems\nfamiliar, safe, and do-able. Knowing the general form of academic writing (simplified in the five-paragraph theme) helps writers\norganize their thoughts; however, it leads some student writers to approach papers as mere fill-in-the-blank exercises.\nI hope you will instead envision paper-writing as a task of working through an unscripted and nuanced thought process and then\nsharing your work with readers. When you\u2019re engaged with the writing process, you\u2019ll find yourself deciding which substantive\npoints belong in those introductory and concluding paragraphs rather than simply filling those paragraphs out with fluff. They\nshould be sort of hard to write; they\u2019re the parts of the paper that express your most important ideas in the most precise ways. If\nyou\u2019re struggling with intros and conclusions, it might be because you\u2019re approaching them in exactly the right way. Having a\nclear, communicative purpose will help you figure out what your reader needs to know to really understand your thinking.\nSo what should you do? Well, start at the beginning. By that I mean, start explaining what the reader needs to know to comprehend\nyour thesis and its importance. For example, compare the following two paragraphs.\nFive-paragraph theme version of a paragraph:\nThroughout time, human societies have had religion. Major world religions since the\ndawn of civilization include Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Animism, Judaism, Christianity,\nand Islam. These and all other religions provide a set of moral principles, a leadership\nstructure, and an explanation for unknown questions such as what happens after people\ndie. Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is\nbased on faith and the other on reason. However, the notion of embodied cognition is a\nplace where physical phenomena connect with religious ones. Paradoxically, religion can\nemphasize a deep involvement in reality, an embodied cognition that empowers followers\n12.7.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120103 to escape from physical constraints and reach a new spirituality. Religion carefully\nconstructs a physical environment to synthesize an individual\u2019s memories, emotions, and\nphysical actions, in a manner that channels the individual\u2019s cognitive state towards\nspiritual transcendence.\nOrganically structured version of the same paragraph:\nReligion is an endeavor to cultivate freedom from bodily constraints to reach a higher\nstate of being beyond the physical constraints of reality. But how is it possible to employ a\nsystem, the human body, to transcend its own limitations? Religion and science have\nalways had an uneasy relationship as empiricism is stretched to explain religious\nphenomena, but psychology has recently added a new perspective to the discussion.\nEmbodiment describes the interaction between humans and the environment that lays a\nfoundation for cognition and can help explain the mechanisms that underlie religion\u2019s\ninfluence on believers. This is a rare moment where science and religion are able to\ncoexist without the familiar controversy. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep\ninvolvement in reality, an embodied cognition that empowers followers to escape from\nphysical constraints and reach a new spirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical\nenvironment to synthesize an individual\u2019s memories, emotions, and physical actions, in a\nmanner that channels the individual\u2019s cognitive state towards spiritual transcendence.\nIn the first version, the first three sentences state well-known facts that do not directly relate to the thesis. The fourth sentence is\nwhere the action starts, though that sentence (\u201cSince the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is\nbased on faith and the other on reason\u201d) is still overstated: when was this dawn of religion? And was there \u201cscience,\u201d as we now\nunderstand it, at that time? The reader has to slog through to the fifth sentence before the intro starts to develop some momentum.\nTraining in the five-paragraph theme format seems to have convinced some student writers that beginning with substantive material\nwill be too abrupt for the reader. But the second example shows that a meatier beginning isn\u2019t jarring; it is actually much more\nengaging. The first sentence of the organic example is somewhat general, but it specifies the particular aspect of religion\n(transcending physical experience) that is germane to the thesis. The next six sentences lay out the ideas and concepts that explain\nthe thesis, which is provided in the last two sentences. Overall, every sentence is needed to thoroughly frame the thesis. It is a\nlively paragraph in itself, and it piques the reader\u2019s interest in the author\u2019s original thinking about religion.\nSometimes a vague introductory paragraph reflects a simple, obvious thesis and a poorly thought-out paper. More often, though, a\nshallow introduction represents a missed opportunity to convey the writer\u2019s depth of thought from the get-go. Students adhering to\nthe five-paragraph theme format sometime assume that such vagueness is needed to bookend an otherwise pithy paper. As you can\nsee from these examples, that is simply untrue. I\u2019ve seen some student writers begin with a vague, high-school style intro (thinking\nit obligatory) and then write a wonderfully vivid and engaging introduction as their second paragraph. Other papers I\u2019ve seen have\nan interesting, original thesis embedded in late body paragraphs that should be articulated up front and used to shape the whole\nbody. If you must write a vague \u201csince the dawn of time\u201d intro to get the writing process going, then go ahead. Just budget the time\nto rewrite the intro around your well developed, arguable thesis and ensure that the body paragraphs are organized explicitly by\nyour analytical thread.\nHere are two more examples of excellent introductory paragraphs written by undergraduate students in different fields. Note how,\nin both cases, (1) the first sentence has real substance, (2) every sentence is indispensable to setting up the thesis, and (3) the thesis\nis complex and somewhat surprising. Both of these introductory paragraphs set an ambitious agenda for the paper. As a reader, it\u2019s\npretty easy to imagine how the body paragraphs that follow will progress through the nuanced analysis needed to carry out the\nthesis.\nFrom Davis O\u2019Connell\u2019s \u201cAbelard\u201d:\n12.7.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120103 He rebelled against his teacher, formed his own rival school, engaged in a\npassionate affair with a teenager, was castrated, and became a monk. All in a\nday\u2019s work. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Peter Abelard gained the title of \u201cheretic\u201d\nalong the way. A 12th-century philosopher and theologian, Abelard tended to\nalienate nearly everyone he met with his extremely arrogant and egotistical\npersonality. This very flaw is what led him to start preaching to students that he\nhad stolen from his former master, which further deteriorated his reputation. Yet\ndespite all of the senseless things that he did, his teachings did not differ much\nfrom Christian doctrine. Although the church claimed to have branded Abelard a\nheretic purely because of his religious views, the other underlying reasons for\nthese accusations involve his conceited personality, his relationship with the 14-\nyear-old Heloise, and the political forces of the 12th century.\nFrom Logan Skelly\u2019s \u201cStaphylococcus aureus\"3:\nBacterial resistance to antibiotics is causing a crisis in modern healthcare. The evolution\nof multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus is of particular concern because of the\nmorbidity and mortality it causes, the limited treatment options it poses, and the difficulty\nin implementing containment measures for its control. In order to appreciate the virulence\nof S. aureus and to help alleviate the problems its resistance is causing, it is important to\nstudy the evolution of antibiotic resistance in this pathogen, the mechanisms of its\nresistance, and the factors that may limit or counteract its evolution. It is especially\nimportant to examine how human actions are causing evolutionary changes in this\nbacterial species. This review will examine the historical sequence of causation that has\nled to antibiotic resistance in this microorganism and why natural selection favors the\nresistant trait. It is the goal of this review to illuminate the scope of the problem produced\nby antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and to illustrate the need for judicious antibiotic\nusage to prevent this pathogen from evolving further pathogenicity and virulence.\nIf vague introductory paragraphs are bad, why were you taught them? In essence, you were taught the form so that you could later\nuse it to deepen your thinking. By producing the five-paragraph theme over and over, it has probably become second nature for you\nto find a clear thesis and shape the intro paragraph around it, tasks you absolutely must accomplish in academic writing. However,\nyou\u2019ve probably been taught to proceed from \u201cgeneral\u201d to \u201cspecific\u201d in your intro and encouraged to think of \u201cgeneral\u201d as \u201cvague\u201d.\nAt the college level, think of \u201cgeneral\u201d as context: begin by explaining the conceptual, historical, or factual context that the reader\nneeds in order to grasp the significance of the argument to come. It\u2019s not so much a structure of general-to-specific; instead, it\u2019s\ncontext-to-argument.\n1 This example is slightly adapted from a student-authored essay: Victor Seet, \u201cEmbodiment in Religion,\u201d Discoveries, 11 (2012).\nDiscoveries is an annual publication of the Knight Institute for Writing in the Disciplines of Cornell University which publishes\nexcellent papers written by Cornell undergraduates.\n2Davis O\u2019Connell, \u201cAbelard: A Heretic of a Different Nature,\u201d Discoveries 10 (2011): 36-41.\n3Logan Skelly, \u201cStaphylococcus aureus: The Evolution of a Persistent Pathogen,\u201d Discoveries 10 (2011): 89-102.\n12.7.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120103 Exercise 12.7.1\nBrowse online articles on The New York Times, The Washington Post, Medium.com, The Atlantic, Time, or other reputable\nwebsites, journals, or newspapers.

You\u2019ve probably been taught to re-state your thesis using different words, and it is true that your reader will likely\nappreciate a brief summary of your overall argument: say, two or three sentences for papers less than 20 pages. It\u2019s perfectly fine to\nuse what they call \u201cmetadiscourse\u201d in this summary; metadiscourse is text like, \u201cI have argued that \u2026\u201d or \u201cThis analysis reveals\nthat \u2026 .\u201d Go ahead and use language like that if it seems useful to signal that you\u2019re restating the main points of your argument. In\nshorter papers you can usually simply reiterate the main point without that metadiscourse: for example, \u201cWhat began as a protest\nabout pollution turned into a movement for civil rights.\u201d If that\u2019s the crux of the argument, your reader will recognize a summary\nlike that. Most of the student papers I see close the argument effectively in the concluding paragraph.\nThe second task of a conclusion\u2014situating the argument within broader implications\u2014is a lot trickier. A lot of instructors describe\nit as the \u201cSo what?\u201d challenge. You\u2019ve proven your point about the role of agriculture in deepening the Great Depression; so what?\nI don\u2019t like the \u201cso what\u201d phrasing because putting writers on the defensive seems more likely to inhibit the flow of ideas than to\ndraw them out. Instead, I suggest you imagine a friendly reader thinking, \u201cOK, you\u2019ve convinced me of your argument. I\u2019m\ninterested to know what you make of this conclusion. What is or should be different now that your thesis is proven?\u201d In that sense,\nyour reader is asking you to take your analysis one step further. That\u2019s why a good conclusion is challenging to write. You\u2019re not\njust coasting over the finish line.\nSo, how do you do that? A thesis can situate an arguable claim within broader implications. If you\u2019ve already articulated a thesis\nstatement that does that, then you\u2019ve already mapped the terrain of the conclusion. Your task then is to explain the implications you\nmentioned: if environmental justice really is the new civil rights movement, then how should scholars and\/or activists approach it?\nIf agricultural trends really did worsen the Great Depression, what does that mean for agricultural policy today? If your thesis, as\nwritten, is a two-story one, then you may want to revisit it after you\u2019ve developed a conclusion you\u2019re satisfied with and consider\nincluding the key implication in that thesis statement. Doing so will give your paper even more momentum.\nLet\u2019s look at the concluding counterparts to the excellent introductions that we\u2019ve read to illustrate some of the different ways\nwriters can accomplish the two goals of a conclusion:\nVictor Seet on religious embodiment:1\nEmbodiment is fundamental to bridging reality and spirituality. The concept demonstrates\nhow religious practice synthesizes human experience in reality\u2014mind, body, and\nenvironment\u2014to embed a cohesive religious experience that can recreate itself. Although\nreligion is ostensibly focused on an intangible spiritual world, its traditions that\neventually achieve spiritual advancement are grounded in reality. The texts, symbols, and\nrituals integral to religious practice go beyond merely distinguishing one faith from\nanother; they serve to fully absorb individuals in a culture that sustains common\nexperiential knowledge shared by millions. It is important to remember that human senses\ndo not merely act as sponges absorbing external information; our mental models of the\nworld are being constantly refined with new experiences. This fluid process allows\nindividuals to gradually accumulate a wealth of religious multimodal information, making\nthe mental representation hyper-sensitive, which in turn contributes to religious\nexperiences. However, there is an important caveat. Many features of religious visions\n12.8.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120104 that are attributed to embodiment can also be explained through less complex cognitive\nmechanisms. The repetition from religious traditions exercised both physically and\nmentally, naturally inculcates a greater religious awareness simply through familiarity.\nReligious experiences are therefore not necessarily caused by embedded cues within the\nenvironment but arise from an imbued fluency with religious themes. Embodiment\nproposes a connection between body, mind, and the environment that attempts to explain\nhow spiritual transcendence is achieved through physical reality. Although embodied\ncognition assuages the conflict between science and religion, it remains to be seen if this\nintricate scientific theory is able to endure throughout millennia just as religious beliefs\nhave.\nThe paragraph first re-caps the argument, then explains how embodiment relates to other aspects of religious experience, and\nfinally situates the analysis within the broader relationship between religion and science.\nFrom Davis O\u2019Connell:2\nLooking at Abelard through the modern historical lens, it appears to many historians that\nhe did not fit the 12th-century definition of a heretic in the sense that his teachings did not\ndiffer much from that of the church. Mews observes that Abelard\u2019s conception of the\nTrinity was a continuation of what earlier Christian leaders had already begun to ponder.\nHe writes: \u201cIn identifying the Son and Holy Spirit with the wisdom and benignity of God,\nAbelard was simply extending an idea (based on Augustine) that had previously been\nraised by William of Champeaux.\u201d St. Augustine was seen as one of the main Christian\nauthorities during the Middle Ages and for Abelard to derive his teachings from that\nsource enhances his credibility. This would indicate that although Abelard was not\nnecessarily a heretic by the church\u2019s official definition, he was branded as one through all\nof the nontheological social and political connotations that \u201cheresy\u201d had come to\nencompass.\nO\u2019Connell, interestingly, chooses a scholarly tone for the conclusion, in contrast to the more jocular tone we saw in the\nintroduction. He doesn\u2019t specifically re-cap the argument about Abelard\u2019s deviance from social norms and political pressures, but\nrather he explains his summative point about what it means to be a heretic. In this case, the implications of the argument are all\nabout Abelard. There aren\u2019t any grand statements about religion and society, the craft of historiography, or the politics of language.\nStill, the reader is not left hanging. One doesn\u2019t need to make far-reaching statements to successfully conclude a paper.\nFrom Logan Skelly:3\nConsidering the hundreds of millions of years that S. aureus has been evolving and\nadapting to hostile environments, it is likely that the past seventy years of human\nantibiotic usage represents little more than a minor nuisance to these bacteria. Antibiotic\nresistance for humans, however, contributes to worldwide health, economic, and\nenvironmental problems. Multi-drug resistant S. aureus has proven itself to be a versatile\nand persistent pathogen that will likely continue to evolve as long as selective pressures,\nsuch as antibiotics, are introduced into the environment. While the problems associated\nwith S. aureus have received ample attention in the scientific literature, there has been\nlittle resolution of the problems this pathogen poses. If these problems are to be resolved,\nit is essential that infection control measures and effective treatment strategies be\ndeveloped, adopted, and implemented in the future on a worldwide scale\u2014so that the\n12.8.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120104 evolution of this pathogen\u2019s virulence can be curtailed and its pathogenicity can be\ncontrolled.\nSkelly\u2019s thesis is about the need to regulate antibiotic usage to mitigate antibiotic resistance. The concluding paragraph\ncharacterizes the pathogens evolutionary history (without re-capping the specifics) and then calls for an informed, well planned,\nand comprehensive response.\nAll three conclusions above achieve both tasks\u2014closing the argument and addressing the implications\u2014but the authors have\nplaced a different emphasis on the two tasks and framed the broader implications in different ways.

That doesn\u2019t mean that you need to write perfectly without a single\nerror; no one does. But as you can imagine, being able to write mostly correct Standard English will likely be a significant\nadvantage in your working life. A r\u00e9sum\u00e9, an email inquiring about a job, a nurse\u2019s notes on a patient, a police report, a complaint--\nall need to be in Standard English. Being able to write Standard English will also allow you to have more of a voice in our\ndemocracy when you write to a politician or post on social media to express your opinion.\nLet\u2019s not deny that there is inherent unfairness built into this expectation. Learning the grammar of Standard English is more work\nif we grew up speaking African American Vernacular English (AAVE) or Spanglish or another of the rich and beautiful dialects of\nEnglish spoken in working-class communities and communities of color across America. Those who grew up speaking another\nlanguage entirely will of course have to work yet harder. Meanwhile, those whose families who speak something similar to\nstandard English will be able to write it with much less effort. None of that is fair, and the unfairness aligns with historical patterns\nof who has it easy and who has it harder in America.\nLet\u2019s be clear, though. College does not demand that we give up speaking our own language or dialect. Most English teachers no\nlonger assert that Standard English is superior. The National Council of Teachers of English made a public declaration\nof \"Students\u2019 Right to Their Own Language\" in 1974. They wrote that \u201cA nation proud of its diverse heritage and its cultural and\nracial variety will preserve its heritage of dialects...The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one\nsocial group to exert its dominance over another.\u201d They write, \u201cWe affirm the students' right to their own patterns and varieties of\nlanguage -- the dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they find their own identity and style.\u201d\nStill, even if much of the time we choose not to speak or write Standard English, it remains a crucial tool. Mainstream audiences\nwill probably not consider our arguments credible in professional or academic settings unless we write in Standard English. Once\nwe feel comfortable writing in this way, we can take pride in being able to code-switch at will. Ideally, we can enjoy our flexibility\nand heightened awareness of language. And we can choose to maintain a sense of pride and identity in relation to our home way of\nspeaking.\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash under the Unsplash License.\nThis page titled 13.1: Why Spend Time on \"Correct\" Standard English? is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed,\nand\/or curated by Anna Mills (ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n13.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/69178 13.2: Proofreading Strategies\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 2 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::0022\nHow to find errors you already know how to fix\nSo when we want to write correct Standard English, what are the most efficient ways to find and fix errors? The first round of\nproofreading is just about finding ways to notice errors so we can correct them. The strategies below can help us recognize where\nwe have written something that we didn\u2019t intend.\nSet your paper aside for a few hours or a few days and then come back to it.\nPrint out a hard copy of your paper and read it aloud to yourself with a pencil in hand to mark errors. Many of us feel shy\nabout doing this even in private, but if we can get past the initial hesitation, listening to what we\u2019ve written can be surprisingly\nhelpful. Our brain registers the words differently when we hear them aloud.\nRead your paper backward one sentence at a time, focusing solely on grammar, punctuation, typos, and missing or repeated\nwords.\nRead your paper aloud to a friend. Having a live audience makes us even more aware of errors. Alternately, have a friend read\nyour paper aloud to you and make notes as you hear things you need to change.\nListen to the computer read your paper aloud to you. This is a built-in feature of most phones and computers now. Go to\n\u201cAccessibility\u201d in settings and look for \u201ctext to speech.\u201d There are many other free programs online: one highly rated one is\nNatural Readers. Most will highlight the words as they read them, so you can easily track where to make corrections.\nExperiment with a couple of text-to-speech platforms with different voice settings and speeds to see what you are most\ncomfortable with.\nHow to find and fix errors you haven\u2019t learned about yet\nUse the Grammarly app to identify mistakes and possible corrections. Grammar checking software has gotten better in recent\nyears, and Grammarly is currently the top-rated one. Even the free version of Grammarly can catch many errors, and the \u201c...\u201d\nlink next to each suggestion will take you to an explanation. Keep in mind that some of the suggestions will be incorrect or will\nchange the meaning of your sentence in a way you don\u2019t intend. Look up any new suggested words or spelling variants to\nconfirm that they fit your meaning. Use the strategies below to learn about any grammar corrections suggested by Grammarly\nand confirm that they reflect your meaning as well. Microsoft Word also has a built-in grammar checker.\nRefer to a grammar handbook when in doubt on a rule. Experienced professional writers like to have these on hand. Your\ncollege\u2019s English department may have a recommended handbook available in the library, tutoring center, or bookstore. You\ncan also get used copies of older editions quite cheaply on Alibris or Amazon. If you get comfortable with a particular\nhandbook, it will be easy to quickly look up a comma rule you\u2019ve forgotten or the correct time to use \u201cwhom.\u201d Most handbooks\nhave a short table of contents on the back page that allows you to scan for the right section without flipping through the entire\nbook.\nOnline grammar resources can take the place of a physical grammar handbook. Start with this book's Chapter 13: Correcting\nGrammar and Punctuation.\nUse a dictionary to check word choice or preposition combinations. Longman is particularly good for finding the prepositions\n(words like \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d) that go with particular words.\nMeet with a tutor to focus solely on grammar. Your tutor should not fix errors for you, but rather let you know what your most\ncommon and serious errors are. The tutor can help you to a better understanding of these errors, and practice fixing them with\nyou, so later you can do it on your own.\n13.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/69408 Schedule a meeting with your instructor to work on grammar. Most instructors will be willing to help and glad that you are\nmotivated to improve.\nThis page titled 13.2: Proofreading Strategies is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by Anna Mills\n(ASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative) .\n13.2.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/69408 13.3: Subject-Verb Agreement\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (22 min, 18 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 2222::1188\nIntroduction\nSubject-verb agreement errors are common, and correcting them will do a lot to improve the writer's professional or academic\ncredibility and make a good impression on readers.\nTo correct such an error, we first need to identify the subject and verb. Every complete sentence, and indeed every complete\nthought, has a subject and a verb at its heart.\nIdentifying subjects\n\"SUBJECT\" by Luca Pedrotti on flickr is licensed CC BY-NC 2.0.\nThe subject, or what the sentence is about, usually appears at the beginning of a sentence as a noun or a pronoun. A noun is a\nword that identifies a person, place, thing, or idea. A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun. Common pronouns are I, he, she, it,\nyou, they, and we. In the sentences below, the subjects are in bold.\nExamples of Subjects in Sentences\nSample sentence with subjects in bold Explanation\nMalik is the project manager for this project. He will give us our In these sentences, the subject is a person: Malik. The pronoun He\nassignments. replaces and refers back to Malik.\nThe computer lab is where we will work. It will be open twenty-four In the first sentence, the subject is a place: computer lab. In the second\nhours a day. sentence, the pronoun It substitutes for computer lab as the subject.\nIn the first sentence, the subject is a thing: project. In the second\nThe project will run for three weeks. It will have a quick turnaround.\nsentence, the pronoun It stands in for the project.\nCompound subjects\nA sentence may have more than one person, place, or thing as the subject. These subjects are called compound subjects. Compound\nsubjects are useful when you want to discuss several subjects at once. In the following examples, \"Desmond and Maria\" and\n\"Books, magazines and online articles\" are compound subjects.\nDesmond and Maria have been working on that design for almost a year.\nBooks, magazines, and online articles are all good resources.\n13.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120121 Prepositional phrases\nYou will often read a sentence that has more than one noun or pronoun in it. You may encounter a group of words that includes a\npreposition with a noun or a pronoun. Prepositions connect a noun, pronoun, or verb to another word that describes or modifies that\nnoun, pronoun, or verb. Common prepositions include in, on, under, near, by, with, and about. A group of words that begin with a\npreposition is called a prepositional phrase. A prepositional phrase begins with a preposition and modifies or describes a word. It\ncannot act as the subject of a sentence. The following example includes the prepositional phrases \"on a business trip,\" \"with the\nfamous pizza,\" \"on the way\" and \"for lunch.\"\nWe went on a business trip. That restaurant with the famous pizza was on the way. We stopped for lunch.\nExercise 13.3.1\nIdentify the subjects and the prepositional phrases in the following sentences.\n1. The gym is open until nine o\u2019clock tonight.\n2. We went to the store to get some ice.\n3. The student with the most extra credit will win a homework pass.\n4. Maya and Tia found an abandoned cat by the side of the road.\n5. The driver of that pickup truck skidded on the ice.\n6. Anita won the race with time to spare.\n7. The people who work for that company were surprised about the merger.\n8. Working in haste means that you are more likely to make mistakes.\n9. The soundtrack has over sixty songs in languages from around the world.\n10. His latest invention does not work, but it has inspired the rest of us.\nIdentifying verbs\nOnce you locate the subject of a sentence, you can move on to the next part of a complete sentence: the verb. A verb is often an\naction word that shows what the subject is doing. A verb can also link the subject to a describing word. There are three types of\nverbs that you can use in a sentence: action verbs, linking verbs, or helping verbs.\n\"Pure Verb\" by Rebecca Siegel on flickr is licensed CC BY 2.0.\nAction verbs\nA verb that connects the subject to an action is called an action verb. An action verb answers the question \"What is the subject\ndoing?\" The following sentences include the action verbs barked and gave.\nThe dog barked at the jogger.\nHe gave a short speech before we ate.\nLinking verbs\nA verb can often connect the subject of the sentence to a describing word. This type of verb is called a linking verb because it links\nthe subject to a describing word. The following sentences include the linking verbs was and seemed.\nThe coat was old and dirty.\n13.3.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120121 The clock seemed broken.\nIf you have trouble telling the difference between action verbs and linking verbs, remember that an action verb shows that the\nsubject is doing something, whereas a linking verb simply connects the subject to another word that describes or modifies the\nsubject. A few verbs can be used as either action verbs or linking verbs. In the following examples, the verb looked is paired\nwith the subject boy, in one case as an action verb and in the other as a linking verb.\nAction Verb: The boy looked for his glove.\nLinking Verb: The boy looked tired.\nAlthough both sentences start with the same words, the two sentences have completely different meanings. In the first sentence, the\nverb describes the boy\u2019s action. In the second sentence, the verb describes the boy\u2019s appearance.\nHelping verbs\nA third type of verb is a helping verb. Helping verbs are used with the main verb to describe a mood or verb tense. Helping verbs\nare usually a form of be, do, or have. The word can is also used as a helping verb. In the following examples, is, does, have, and\ncan are helping verbs and known, speak up, seen, and tell are action verbs.\nThe restaurant is known for its variety of dishes.\nShe does speak up when prompted in class.\nWe have seen that movie three times.\nShe can tell when someone walks on her lawn.\nExercise 13.3.2\nFind the verbs in the following sentences and decide whether each is an action, verb, linking verb, or a helping verb.\n1. The cat sounds ready to come back inside.\n2. We have not eaten dinner yet.\n3. It took four people to move the broken-down car.\n4. The book was filled with notes from class.\n5. We walked from room to room, inspecting for damages.\n6. Harold was expecting a package in the mail.\n7. The clothes still felt damp even though they had been through the dryer twice.\n8. The teacher who runs the studio is often praised for his restoration work on old masterpieces.\nSubject-verb agreement\nAgreement in writing refers to a consistent grammatical match between words. Subject-verb agreement describes the match\nbetween subjects and verbs. Because subjects and verbs are either singular or plural, the subject of a sentence and the verb of a\nsentence must agree with each other in number. That is, a singular subject belongs with a singular verb form, and a plural subject\nbelongs with a plural verb form. In the examples below, the singular verb jumps is used with the singular subject cat, while the\nplural jump goes with plural subject cats.\nSingular: The cat jumps over the fence.\nPlural: The cats jump over the fence.\nRegular verbs follow a predictable pattern. For example, in the third person singular, regular verbs always end in -s. Other forms of\nregular verbs do not end in -s.\nRegular Verbs in Present Tense\nPerson Singular Form Plural Form\nFirst Person (\"I\") I do. We do.\nSecond Person (\"you\") You do. You do.\n13.3.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120121 Person Singular Form Plural Form\nThird Person (\"she,\" \"he,\" singular \"they\"\nHe\/She\/They\/It does. They do.\nor \"it\")\nA note on singular they\nThey and their can now be used to refer to a single person whose gender is unknown or to a person who identifies as nonbinary, as\nin \"A teacher should consider their students' responses. They should ask for student feedback.\" However, it is still considered\nawkward to use the singular they directly with a singular verb. So when referring to a single teacher, instead of the awkward \"They\nhas a duty to find out whether students are learning from their teaching,\" we could write, \"They have a duty...\" See the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary's \"A Brief History of Singular They.\"\nExercise 13.3.3\nComplete the following sentences with the correct present tense form of be, have, or do.\n1. I ________ sure that you will succeed.\n2. They ________ front-row tickets to the show.\n3. He ________ a great Elvis impersonation.\n4. We ________ so excited to meet you in person!\n5. She ________ a fever and a sore throat.\n6. You ________ not know what you are talking about.\n7. You ________ all going to pass this class.\n8. She ________ not going to like that.\n9. It ________ appear to be the right size.\n10. They ________ ready to take this job seriously.\nTypes of subject-verb agreement errors\nErrors in subject-verb agreement frequently occur when\na sentence contains a compound subject;\nthe subject of the sentence is separate from the verb;\nthe subject of the sentence is an indefinite pronoun, such as anyone or everyone;\nthe subject of the sentence is a collective noun, such as team or organization;\nthe subject appears after the verb.\nCan you find the subject-verb agreement error here?\n\"Weird Plural-Singular conflict\" by zimpenfish on Flickr is licensed under CC BY 2.0.\nCompound subjects\nA compound subject is formed by two or more nouns and the coordinating conjunctions and, or, or nor. A compound subject can\nbe made of singular subjects, plural subjects, or a combination of singular and plural subjects.\nCompound subjects combined with and take a plural verb form. In the sentences below, the compound subjects are in bold.\n13.3.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120121 Examples of compound subjects joined with and\nSubject type Sample sentence Explanation\nAlicia and Miguel are the singular subjects,\nAlicia and Miguel ride their bikes to the\nTwo singular subjects which combine to form a plural compound\nbeach.\nsubject, and ride is the plural verb.\nGirls and boys are the plural subjects, which\nThe girls and the boys ride their bikes to the\nTwo plural subjects combine to form a plural compound subject,\nbeach.\nand ride is the plural verb.\nAlicia is a singular subject, boys is a plural\nAlicia and the boys ride their bikes to the\nSingular and plural subjects subject; they combine to form a plural\nbeach.\ncompound subject, and ride is the plural verb.\nCompound subjects combined with or and nor are treated separately.

Often, prepositional phrases or dependent clauses add more\ninformation to the sentence and appear between the subject and the verb. These words in between subject and verb may distract the\nwriter and lead them to a subject-verb agreement error.\nOne way to find the main subject and verb in this case is to cross out or ignore the phrases and clauses that begin with prepositions\nor dependent words. The subject of a sentence will never be in a prepositional phrase or dependent clause.\nThe following sentences each show a subject and verb separated by a prepositional phrase:\nThe students with the best grades win the academic awards. (Students is the subject and win is the verb.)\nThe puppy under the table is my favorite. (Puppy is the subject and is is the verb.)\nThe following is an example of a subject and verb separated by a dependent clause:\nThe car that I bought has power steering and a sunroof. (Car is the subject and has is the verb.)\nThe representatives who are courteous sell the most tickets. (Representatives is the subject and sell is the verb.)\nIndefinite pronouns\nIndefinite pronouns such as anybody, each, or all refer to an unspecified person, thing, or number. When an indefinite pronoun\nserves as the subject of a sentence, you will often use a singular verb form.\nHowever, keep in mind that exceptions arise. Some indefinite pronouns may require a plural verb form. To determine whether to\nuse a singular or plural verb with an indefinite pronoun, consider the noun that the pronoun would refer to. If the noun is plural,\nthen use a plural verb with the indefinite pronoun.\nCommon Indefinite Pronouns and the Verb Forms They Agree with\nIndefinite Pronouns That Always Take a Singular Verb Indefinite Pronouns That Can Take a Singular or Plural Verb\nanybody, anyone, anything All\neach Any\n13.3.28 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120121 Indefinite Pronouns That Always Take a Singular Verb Indefinite Pronouns That Can Take a Singular or Plural Verb\neverybody, everyone, everything None\nmuch Some\nmany\nnobody, no one, nothing\nsomebody, someone, something\nExamples of Subject-Verb Agreement with Indefinite Pronouns\nSample sentence with the indefinite pronoun in bold and the verb in\nWhy the indefinite pronoun is plural or singular in this case\nitalics\nThe indefinite pronoun everybody takes a singular verb form, sings,\nSingular: Everybody in the kitchen sings along when that song comes\nbecause everybody refers to a group performing the same action as a\non the radio.\nsingle unit.\nPlural: All the people in the kitchen sing along when that song comes The indefinite pronoun all takes a plural verb form, sing, because all\non the radio. refers to the plural noun people. Because people is plural, all is plural.\nIn this sentence, the indefinite pronoun all takes a singular verb form,\nSingular: All the cake is on the floor. is, because all refers to the singular noun cake. Because cake is singular,\nall is singular.\nCollective nouns\nA collective noun, such as family or group, is a noun that identifies more than one person, place, or thing and considers those\npeople, places, or things one singular unit. Because collective nouns are counted as one, they are singular and require a singular\nverb. Some commonly used collective nouns are group, team, army, flock, family, and class, as in the following example.\nSingular: The class is going on a field trip. (Class is the subject and is is the verb.)\nIn this sentence, class is a collective noun. Although the class consists of many students, the class is treated as a singular unit and\nrequires a singular verb form, is.\nThe subject follows the verb\nIn some sentences, the subject comes after the verb instead of before the verb. This may lead to a subject-verb agreement error\nbecause the writer may not recognize the subject and form the verb accordingly. The most common such sentences begin with here\nor there, as in the following examples.\nHere is my wallet! (Wallet is the subject and is is the verb.)\nThere are thirty dolphins in the water. (Dolphins is the subject and are is the verb.)\nOne way to identify the subject and verb is by reversing the order of the sentence so the subject comes first, as we demonstrate\nbelow.\n\"Here is my wallet!\" becomes \"My wallet is here.\" (Wallet is the subject and is is the verb.)\n\"There are thirty dolphins in the water\" becomes \"Thirty dolphins are in the water.\" (Dolphins is the subject and are is the\nverb.)\nExercise 13.3.4\nWhich of the following sentences have errors in subject-verb agreement? Correct any errors you find.\n1. My dog and cats chases each other all the time.\n2. The books that are in my library is the best I have ever read.\n3.

A fragment may express part of an idea, but the\nreader will be expecting something further to complete the thought. An intuitive way to see if a sentence is a fragment is to put the\nwords \"I think that\" in front of it. If the sentence is a complete thought, we should be able to introduce it with \"I think that\" and\nhave it make sense. For example, take the following sentence: \"Children helping in the kitchen.\" We can try writing, \"I think that\nchildren helping in the kitchen.\" Readers will be wondering, \"What about the children helping?\" Something is clearly missing.\nA half of a dollar is no good on its own; likewise, a fragment needs more words to make it a complete thought.\n\"Dollar Bill Cut in Half\" by Images_of_Money is licensed under CC BY 2.0.\nGrammatically speaking, a fragment lacks a main subject or a main verb or both. \"Children helping in the kitchen\" is missing a\nmain verb. We could make it into a complete sentence below by adding a main verb, make, as shown below.\nFragment: Children helping in the kitchen.\nComplete sentence: Children helping in the kitchen often make a mess.\nSee whether you can identify which fragment below is missing a subject and which is missing a verb.\nFragment: Told her about the broken vase.\nComplete sentence: I told her about the broken vase.\nFragment: The store down on MLK Drive.\nComplete sentence: The store down on MLK Drive sells music.\nFixing fragments\nCombine the fragment with a nearby sentence\nOften a fragment belongs with the sentence before or after it. If the sentence before or after can complete the thought, the simplest\nway to fix the fragment is to join the two. Writers sometimes create fragments when we are trying to avoid run-ons. We may feel\nthat a sentence is getting too long. Remember, however, that it is fine to write a long sentence if any independent clauses are\nconnected with the right punctuation and connecting words. It is also fine to break the sentence up if it seems too long, but in that\ncase we need to make sure that each resulting sentence is complete on its own.\n13.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120122 Often, a fragment fits as part of a nearby sentence.\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay under the Pixabay License.\nAdd words to complete the thought\nIf there is no sentence before or after the fragment that naturally completes its meaning, we can add words to make the fragment\ninto a full sentence. This might mean adding a main subject or verb or a whole independent clause.\nFragment: Not understanding the nature of capitalism and the way it encourages everyone to believe they will likely become\nrich.\nComplete sentence: The general public does not understand that capitalism by nature encourages everyone to believe they will\nlikely become rich.\nIn the first version in the above example, readers would not have known who was not understanding. The beginning of the sentence\nwas a verbal phrase without a main subject and verb. The first version did include a clause with subject and verb (\"it encourages\"),\nbut that clause was serving to describe the noun \"way.\" There was no main verb to go with \"way.\" The revised complete sentence\nadded a subject, \"the general public\" and changed the verb from the -ing form into a main verb, \"does not understand.\" The revision\nalso condensed the sentence by cutting out \"the way it.\"\nCommon fragment patterns\nBelow are some common patterns that fragments take with sample corrections. In each case, there is a word or a grammatical\nfeature that signals to the reader that the phrase is not the main idea but a side idea in the sentence.\nPrepositional phrases\nPrepositions are words such as in, at, on, of, after, and before. They introduce other words and make a group of words into a\nprepositional phrase. If a prepositional phrase is not connected to a complete sentence, it is a fragment. Often we can connect the\nprepositional phrase to a sentence before or after it. If we add it to the beginning of the other sentence, we need to insert a comma\nafter the prepositional phrase.\nFragment: After walking over two miles. Tamika remembered their wallet.\nComplete sentence: After walking over two miles, Tamika remembered their wallet.\nComplete sentence: John remembered his wallet after walking over two miles.\nDependent words\nDependent words like since, because, without, or unless signal to the reader that a clause is not the main point of the sentence. A\ndependent clause will have a subject and verb, but it still cannot stand on its own. Like prepositional phrases, a dependent clause\ncan be a fragment if it is not connected to an independent clause containing a main subject and verb. To fix the problem, we can\nadd such a fragment to the beginning or end of an independent clause. When we add the fragment to the beginning of a sentence,\nwe follow it with a comma.\nFragment: Because we lost power. The entire family overslept.\nComplete sentence: Because we lost power, the entire family overslept.\nComplete sentence: The entire family overslept because we lost power.\nFragment: He has been seeing a physical therapist. Since his accident.\nComplete sentence: Since his accident, he has been seeing a physical therapist.\nComplete sentence: He has been seeing a physical therapist since his accident.\n13.4.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120122 Gerunds\nAnother common fragment pattern is a phrase that centers on a verb in -ing form. If we use an -ing form we should double-check\nthat there is a main subject and verb. The main verb itself can't be in -ing form, and verbs in -ing form also often appear without a\nsubject.\nFragment: Taking deep breaths. Saul prepared for his presentation.\nComplete sentence: Taking deep breaths, Saul prepared for his presentation.\nComplete sentence: Taking deep breaths helped Saul prepare for his presentation.\nInfinitives\nAnother kind of phrase that commonly gets left to stand on its own is an infinitive phrase, or a verb paired with the word to such\nas to run, to write, or to reach. Like an -ing form, an infinitive cannot be used as the main verb.\nFragment: We needed to make three hundred more paper cranes. To reach the one thousand mark.\nComplete sentence: We needed to make three hundred more paper cranes to reach the one thousand mark.\nExercise 13.4.1\nFind the fragments below, and either add words or combine the fragment with the independent clause to create a complete\nsentence.\n1. Working without taking a break. We try to get as much work done as we can in an hour.\n2. I needed to bring work home. In order to meet the deadline.\n3. Unless the ground thaws before spring break. We won\u2019t be planting any tulips this year.\n4. Turning the lights off after he was done in the kitchen. Camilo tries to conserve energy whenever possible.\n5.

Not\nall long sentences are run-ons. A sentence can be many lines and still be correct if all its parts are connected with the correct\npunctuation and connecting words.\nA comma is not enough to correctly join two complete thoughts or independent clauses. Using a comma to join complete thoughts\nis a type of run-on sentence error called a comma splice.\nRun-on sentence: Driverless cars with drivers in them are becoming common companies must be test driving the\ntechnology.\nComma splice: Driverless cars with drivers in them are becoming common, companies must be test driving the technology.\nFixing run-on sentences\nThere are several options for fixing a run-on sentence. We can keep the two complete ideas together in one sentence, or we can\nseparate them into two sentences. If we keep them together, we can add a word to clarify the connection between the two ideas, or,\nif the connection is already obvious, we can connect them with the right punctuation. Punctuation alone can technically fix a run-\non; however, if readers are likely to miss the connection between the two ideas, a connecting word will be important as well. There\nare several types of connecting words, each of which needs different punctuation. We can consider which option best helps the\nreader absorb the ideas and see their relationship.\nUse a period to separate the ideas\nAdding a period will correct the run-on by creating two separate sentences. This allows the reader to absorb the ideas one at a\ntime. This can be a good option if the connection between the ideas is clear, if the combination is difficult to follow, and if the\npiece of writing does not already have too many short sentences. It's worth considering the other options as well before deciding to\nfix a run-on with a period.\nRun-on: There were no seats left, we had to stand in the back.\nComplete sentence: There were no seats left. We had to stand in the back.\nUse a semi-colon to keep closely related ideas together\nA semi-colon can be used to connect two complete ideas or independent clauses in one sentence. Two closely related ideas can stay\ntogether this way without any additional words. This is a good option as long as it is clear how the two ideas relate.\nRun-on: The accident closed both lanes of traffic we waited an hour for the wreckage to be cleared.\nComplete sentence: The accident closed both lanes of traffic; we waited an hour for the wreckage to be cleared.\nUse a coordinating conjunction\nYou can also fix run-on sentences by adding a comma and a coordinating conjunction. A coordinating conjunction acts as a link\nbetween two independent clauses.\nThese are the seven coordinating conjunctions that you can use: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. Choose one that shows the\nrelationship between the ideas when you want to link the two independent clauses. The acronym FANBOYS will help you\n13.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120123 remember this group of coordinating conjunctions. In the example below, we correct the run-on by adding the coordinating\nconjunction but between the two independent clauses.\nRun-on: The new printer was installed, no one knew how to use it.\nComplete sentence: The new printer was installed, but no one knew how to use it.\nUse a conjunctive adverb\nAnother kind of connecting word or transition word is a conjunctive adverb such as \"however,\" \"therefore,\" \"thus,\" \"also,\" and\n\"similarly.\" A sentence with one of these words will still need a semi-colon in between the independent clauses. After the\nsemicolon, add the conjunctive adverb and follow it with a comma. In the example below, we correct the run-on using the\nconjunctive adverb however.\nRun-on: The project was put on hold we didn\u2019t have time to slow down, so we kept working.\nComplete sentence: The project was put on hold; however, we didn\u2019t have time to slow down, so we kept working.\nUse a dependent word to emphasize one idea over another\nDependent words such as because and although, also called subordinators, can show a relationship between two independent\nclauses. If we put a dependent word in front of a clause, we have a dependent clause. That means that the clause is not a complete\nthought on its own: the dependent word signals that we need to connect it to an independent clause.\nA dependent word signals that the main point of the sentence lies elsewhere. It de-emphasizes the clause it goes with.\nIf a sentence starts with a dependent clause, put a comma before the independent clause starts. If the dependent word comes in the\nmiddle of the sentence no comma is used. In the examples below, we correct the run-ons using the dependent\nwords although and because.\nRun-on: We took the elevator, the others still got there before us.\nComplete sentence: Although we took the elevator, the others got there before us.\nRun-on: Cobwebs covered the furniture, the room hadn\u2019t been used in years.\nComplete sentence: Cobwebs covered the furniture because the room hadn\u2019t been used in years.\nExercise 13.5.1\nFind and fix the run-on sentences in the following passages:\n1. The report is due on Wednesday but we\u2019re flying back from San Diego that morning. I told the project manager that we\nwould be able to get the report to her later that day she suggested that we come back a day early to get the report done and I\ntold her we had meetings until our flight took off. We e-mailed our contact who said that they would check with his boss,\nshe said that the project could afford a delay as long as they wouldn\u2019t have to make any edits or changes to the file our new\ndeadline is next Friday.\n2. Alma tried getting a reservation at the restaurant, but when she called they said that there was a waiting list so she put our\nnames down on the list when the day of our reservation arrived we only had to wait thirty minutes because a table opened\nup unexpectedly which was good because we were able to catch a movie after dinner in the time we\u2019d expected to wait to\nbe seated.\n3. Without a doubt, my favorite artist is Leonardo da Vinci, not because of his paintings but because of his fascinating designs,\nmodels, and sketches, including plans for scuba gear, a flying machine, and a life-size mechanical lion that actually walked\nand moved its head.

Verb tense identifies the time of action described\nin a sentence. Helping verbs, such as be and have, also work to create verb tenses, such as the future tense. For a full list and\ndescriptions of verb tenses, see \"Verbs and Verb Tense\" in Writing, Reading, and College Success, edited by Athena Kashyap and\nErika Dyquisto. Here are a few of the most common tenses:\nCommon Verb Tenses\nVerb tense Sample verb Sample sentence with the verb in bold\npast tense walked Yesterday, they walked to the laundromat.\npresent tense walks Achara walks toschool.\npresent progressive tense are walking Sara and Kimmy are walking to a cafe.\nSumita has walked to the corner store twice\npresent perfect tense has walked\nalready.\nNext weekend, they will walk to thefarmer's\nfuture tense will walk\nmarket.\nMaintaining consistent verb tense\nSometimes without realizing it we may shift tense as we write. This can be jarring or confusing for the reader. it is important to use\nthe same verb tense consistently and to avoid shifting from one tense to another unless there is a good reason for the tense shift.\nExamples of Consistent and Inconsistent Verb Tenses\nSample sentence with the verbs in bold Explanation\nInconsistent tense: The verb starts is in present tense, but the\nThe crowd starts cheering as Melina approached the finish line.\nverb approached is in past tense.\nConsistent tense: The verbs started and approached are both in past\nThe crowd started cheering as Melina approached the finish line.\ntense.\nConsistent tense: The verbs starts and approaches are both in present\nThe crowd starts cheering as Melina approaches the finish line.\ntense.\nIn some cases, we need to use different tenses in the same sentence. If the time frame for each action or state is different, a tense\nshift is appropriate.\nExample of an Appropriate Shift in Verb Tense\nSample sentence with the verbs in bold Explanation\nAppropriate shift in verb tense: The verb wanted is in past tense to\nWhen I was a teenager, I wanted to be a firefighter, but now I am\ndescribe a past feeling, whereas the verb am studying is in present\nstudying computer science.\nprogressive tense to describe an ongoing present action.\n13.6.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120512 Exercise 13.6.1\nEdit the following paragraph by correcting any cases of inconsistent verb tense.\nIn the Middle Ages, most people lived in villages and work as agricultural laborers, or peasants. Every village has a \u201clord,\u201d and\nthe peasants worked on his land. Much of what they produce go to the lord and his family. What little food was leftover goes to\nsupport the peasants\u2019 families. In return for their labor, the lord offers them protection. A peasant\u2019s day usually began before\nsunrise and involves long hours of backbreaking work, which includes plowing the land, planting seeds, and cutting crops for\nharvesting. The working life of a peasant in the Middle Ages is usually demanding and exhausting.\nPast and present tense in academic essays\nIn academic writing, as in other situations, we generally use past tense for historical events and present tense for present conditions.\nThere is one convention, though, that might not seem intuitive. Academic writing uses the present tense for ideas that come alive\nin the present as we read them, even if they were written down in the past. This is called the literary present. It is as if the\nconversation that takes place about issues in books and essays is always going on and writers continue to voice their opinions now\nthrough their recorded words. So if we write about a study, we would say \"The researchers conclude that...\" If we write about a\nnewspaper opinion piece, we would say \"The author maintains that...\" In Chapter 3: Writing a Summary of Another Writer's\nArgument, we saw many examples of this use of present tense in the suggested phrases for describing arguments.\nIf we shift, however, to talking about a past action or a condition during a past time period, we should switch to the past tense for\nthat. For example, let's say we are analyzing Barack Obama's memoir Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and\nInheritance. We might write, \"Obama describes his upbringing by a white mother after his father returned to Kenya.\"\nExercise 13.6.2\nFor each sentence below, decide whether the verb should be in simple past or simple present tense to best fit the meaning.e\n1. The Dust Bowl (is, was) a name given to a period of very destructive dust storms that occurred in the United States during\nthe 1930s.\n2. Historians today (consider, considered) the Dust Bowl to be one of the worst weather events in American history.\n3. The Dust Bowl mostly (affects, affected) the states of Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico.\n4. John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath (describes, described) a family's flight from the Dust Bowl to California.\n5. Dust storms (continue, continued, will continue) to affect the region, but hopefully they will not be as destructive as the\nstorms of the 1930s.\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing for Success, created by an author and publisher who prefer to remain anonymous, adapted and\npresented by the Saylor Foundation and licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\n13.6: Verb Tense is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n13.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120512 13.7: Pronoun Agreement\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (19 min, 23 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1199::2233\nPronouns help a writer avoid constant repetition. If there were no pronouns, we would soon be frustrated by reading sentences like\n\"Asha said Asha was tired.\" A pronoun, however, can refer back to a word from earlier in the text so we don't have to repeat it:\n\"Asha said she was tired.\"\nSince pronouns can be singular or plural and gender-neutral, feminine, or masculine, we need to make sure that we use the pronoun\nform that matches the word it refers to. (The word the pronoun refers to is often called the antecedent.) Pronoun agreement errors\noccur when the pronoun and the word it refers to do not match, or agree with each other.\nExamples of pronoun agreement\nSample sentence with a pronoun and the noun it refers to in bold Explanation\nLani complained that she was exhausted.

It has long been common in speech to use \"they\" to refer to\none person, but for years grammarians declared it incorrect. This rule has changed in recent years. Singular they has become\naccepted as a way to counter sexism in language and promote inclusivity. As of 2019, the Associated Press, the Oxford English\nDictionary, the Chicago Manual of Style, the MLA style manual, and the APA style manual all accept use of singular they. The\nMLA article \"How Do I Use Singular They?\" outlines the following two cases:\n1. Singular they can refer to a person who takes they\/them pronouns.\n\"Gender Neutral Pronouns\" by The Focal Project on Flickr is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0.\nMerriam-Webster's dictionary added this use of they in 2019, as discussed in the article \"Singular 'They': Though singular 'they'\nis old, 'they' as a nonbinary pronoun is new\u2014and useful.\" Many people do not feel 100% male or 100% female. If a person\nindicates that their pronoun is they\/them, go ahead and use they or them even in cases where you are referring just to that one\nperson. For a full discussion of etiquette around pronouns and gender identity, see MyPronouns.org.\n2. Singular they can refer to a general case where gender is unknown or irrelevant. Previously, we were taught to use his or her in\nthis case, but now they is preferred.

I is used for the subject of a sentence, and me is used\nfor the object of an action, as in \"She helped me.\" Subject pronouns function as subjects in a sentence. Object pronouns function as\nthe object of a verb or of a preposition.\nSingular subject and object pronouns\nSubject pronouns Object pronouns\nI me\nyou you\nhe, she, it, they (gender-neutral or non-binary use) him, she, its, their (gender-neutral or nonbinary use)\nPlural subject and object pronouns\nSubject pronouns Object pronouns\nwe us\n13.7.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120107 Subject pronouns Object pronouns\nyou you\nthey them\nIn the following sentences, the pronouns she and they serve as subjects:\n1. She loves tai chi.\n2. Every summer, they picked up litter from the local beach.\nIn the following sentences, the pronouns him and it serve as objects:\n1. Marie leaned over and kissed him.\n2. Jingyi moved it to the corner.\nTip\nNote that a pronoun can also be the object of a preposition, as in the sentence \"My mother stood between us.\" The\npronoun us is the object of the preposition between. It answers the question between whom?\nCompound subject pronouns are two or more pronouns joined by a conjunction or a preposition that function together as the subject\nof the sentence. Compound object pronouns are two or more pronouns joined by a conjunction or a preposition that function\ntogether as the object of the sentence.\nExamples of correct and incorrect pronoun case with compound subjects\nSample sentence with the pronouns in bold Explanation\nIncorrect: The pronoun me is in object case but is used as part of the\nMe and Ananya just started learning Arabic. compound subject of the sentence.\nCorrect: The pronoun I is in subject case and is used as part of the\nAnanya and I just started learning Arabic. compound subject of the sentence.\nIncorrect: The pronoun I is in subject case but is used as part of the\nThe conversation group helped Ananya and I learn Arabic. compound object of the verb helped.\nCorrect: The pronoun me is in object case and is used as part of the\nThe conversation group helped Ananya and me learn Arabic. compound object of the verb helped.\nNotes\nIt is standard to write Ananya and me rather than me and Ananya. This rule developed because it is considered more polite\nto refer to ourselves after another person.\nOne way to check whether the pronoun case in a compound subject is correct is to try the sentence with only the pronoun.\nFor example, \"Me just started learning Arabic\" sounds more obviously incorrect.\nExercise 13.7.3\nRevise any sentences in which the subject and object pronouns are used incorrectly.\n1. Meera and me enjoy doing yoga together on Sundays.\n2. She and him have decided to sell their house.\n3. Between you and I, I do not think Jeffrey will win the election.\n4. Us and our friends have game night the first Thursday of every month.\n5. They and I met while on vacation in Mexico.\n6. Napping on the beach never gets boring for Alice and I.\n7. New Year\u2019s Eve is not a good time for she and I to have a serious talk.\n8. You exercise much more often than me.\n9. I am going to the comedy club with Yolanda and she.\n13.7.5 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120107 10. The cooking instructor taught her and me a lot.\nA special case: who versus whom\nWho or whoever is always the subject of a verb. Use who or whoever when the pronoun performs the action indicated by the\nverb. On the other hand, whom and whomever serve as objects. They are used when the pronoun does not perform an action. Use\nwhom or whomever when the pronoun is the direct object of a verb or the object of a preposition.\nExamples of correct use of who and whom\nSample sentence with the pronouns in bold Explanation\nCorrect: The word who is the subject of the verb won, so subject case\nWho won the game last Tuesday? is appropriate.\nCorrect: The word who is the subject of the verb came, so subject case\nis appropriate even though who is also the object of the\nI wonder who came up with that terrible idea!\nverb wonder. Who is the subject within its own clause.\nCorrect: The word whom functions as the direct object of the verb\nWhom did Frank marry the third time? marry, so object case is appropriate.\nCorrect: The word whom functions as the object of the\nFrom whom did you buy that old CD player?. preposition from so object case is appropriate.\nTip\nIf you are having trouble deciding when to use who and whom, try this trick. Take the following sentence: \"Who\/Whom do I\nconsider my best friend?\" Reorder the sentence in your head, using either she or her, he or him, or they or them in place of who\nor whom.\nI consider her my best friend.\nI consider she my best friend.\nThe second sentence will sound wrong to experienced English speakers. So the trick is, if you can use her, him, or them, you\nshould use whom.\nExercise 13.7.4\nComplete the following sentences by adding who or whom.\n1. ________ hit the home run?\n2. I remember ________ won the Academy Award for Best Actor last year.\n3. To ________ is the letter addressed?\n4. I have no idea ________ left the iron on, but I am going to find out.\n5. ________ are you going to recommend for the internship?\n6. With ________ are you going to Hawaii?\n7.

Generally, we want to choose words that convey our meaning precisely and\nare not jarring to readers. If we are considering whether a particular word works in a particular sentence, we can look up\nits definition and examples of how it is used to check whether it fits our purpose.\nUsing dictionary definitions\nEven professional writers need help with the meanings, spellings, pronunciations, and uses of particular words. In fact, they rely on\ndictionaries to help them write better. No one knows every word in the English language and their multiple uses and meanings, so\nall writers, from novices to professionals, can benefit from the use of dictionaries.\nMost dictionaries provide the following information:\nSpelling. How the word and its different forms are spelled.\nPronunciation. How to say the word.\nPart of speech. The function of the word.\nDefinition. The meaning of the word.\nSynonyms. Words that have similar meanings.\nEtymology. The history of the word.\nLook at the following sample dictionary entry and see which of the preceding information you can identify:\nDefinition\nmyth, mith, n. [Gr. mythos, a word, a fable, a legend.] A fable or legend embodying the convictions of a people as to their gods\nor other divine beings, their own beginnings and early history and the heroes connected with it, or the origin of the world; any\ninvented story; something or someone having no existence in fact.\u2014myth \u2022 ic, myth \u2022 i \u2022 cal\nChecking examples of how a word is commonly used\nSometimes a word's definition suggests that it fits our meaning, but the word is not commonly used in the way we want to use it. It\nmay call up feelings or associations we don't intend. See 8.2: Word Choice and Connotation for much more on the emotional\nassociations of words. It may also be that a word is more formal or informal than we intend. For example, slang might be fine in\nconversation with peers but jarring to our readers if we are writing an essay for a general academic audience. See 9.3: Distance and\nIntimacy for more on choosing the level of formality that fits our purpose.\nMost dictionaries also offer brief samples of sentences or phrases that use the word in question, so we can start by reading those to\nget an idea of a word's common usage patterns. A Google search on the word will turn up additional sample sentences. We may\nwant to search a specific publication's website, like the New York Times. To do that, enter the word into a search engine followed\nby \"site:\" and the website we want to search. For example, if we want to look for examples of how the word precocious is\ncommonly used, we would enter the following into a search engine:\nprecocious site:nytimes.com\nThe results would include many examples of the word precocious used in sentences in New York Times articles. Since the New York\nTimes is known for high editorial standards, we can be confident that the word will be used correctly according to common usage.\n13.8.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120117 Choosing specific words over general words\nSpecific words and images make writing more interesting. Whenever possible, avoid overly general words in your writing; instead,\ntry to replace general language with particular nouns, verbs, and modifiers that convey details and that bring words to life. Add\nwords that provide color, texture, sound, and even smell to your writing.\nGeneral: My new puppy is cute.\nSpecific: My new puppy is a ball of white fuzz with the biggest black eyes I have ever seen.\nGeneral: My teacher told us that plagiarism is bad.\nSpecific: My teacher, Ms. Liu, created a presentation detailing exactly how plagiarism is illegal and unethical.\nExercise 13.8.4\nRevise the following sentences by replacing the overly general words with more precise and attractive language.

It can show the relationship between the\nwords it connects. Sometimes changing the preposition can change the meaning of the sentence completely.\nThere are some general rules about preposition use described below. Choosing the correct preposition often depends on knowing\nthe standard patterns of usage for the words the prepositions connect to. Often consulting a dictionary will be the best way to\ndetermine the right preposition combination.\nPrepositions for location and time\nMost prepositions such as above, below, and behind usually indicate a location in the physical world, but some prepositions such as\nduring, after, and until show location in time. The prepositions in, at, and on are used to indicate both location and time, but they\nare used in specific ways. The tables below show when to use each one.\nThe Preposition in\nTime Example Place Example\nyear in 1942 country in Zimbabwe\nmonth in August state in California\nseason in the summer city in Chicago\ntime of day (not with night) in the afternoon\nThe Preposition on\nTime Example Place Example\nday on Monday surfaces on the table\ndate on May 23 streets on 124th Street\nspecific days\/dates on Monday modes of transportation on the bus\nThe Preposition at\nTime Example Place Example\ntime at five o\u2019clock addresses at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\nwith night at night location at Rooney\u2019s Grill\nExercise 13.9.1\nEdit the following letter from a resident to her landlord by correcting errors with in, at, and on.\n13.9.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120120 Dear Mrs. Salazar,\nI am writing this letter to inform you that I will be vacating apartment 2A in 356 Maple Street at Wednesday, June 30, 2010.

I have enjoyed living at Austin, Texas, but I\nwant to explore other parts of the country now.\nSincerely,\nMilani Davis\nPrepositions after verbs\nPrepositions often follow verbs to create expressions with distinct meanings. These expressions are sometimes called prepositional\nverbs. It is important to remember that these expressions cannot be separated.\nVerb and Preposition Combinations\nSample sentence with the verb and\nVerb + preposition Meaning\npreposition in bold\nagree with to agree with something or someone My husband always agrees with me.\nto express regret for something, to say sorry\napologize for I apologize for being late.\nabout something\napply for to ask for something formally I will apply for that job.\nto have a firm conviction in something; to\nbelieve in I believe in educating the world\u2019s women.\nbelieve in the existence of something\nto think that someone or something is\ncare about I care about the health of our oceans.\nimportant\nhear about to be told about something or someone I heard about the teachers\u2019 strike.\nWill you look after my dog while I am on\nlook after to watch or to protect someone or something\nvacation?\nWe will talk about the importance of\ntalk about to discuss something\nrecycling.\nspeak to, with to talk to\/with someone I will speak to their teacher tomorrow.\nwait for to await the arrival of someone or something I will wait for my package to arrive.\nExercise 13.9.2\nFor each of the sentences below, choose the correct verb and preposition combination to fit the meaning.\n1.

Pavel said he was going to ________ (believe in, apply for) the internship.\n4. Jonas would not ________ (talk about, apologize for) eating the last piece of cake.\n5. I ________ (care about, agree with) the environment very much.\nPrepositions after adjectives\nSimilar to prepositions after verbs, prepositions after adjectives create expressions with distinct meanings unique to English.\nRemember, like prepositional verbs, these expressions also cannot be separated.\nAdjective and Preposition Combinations\nSample sentence with the adjective and\nAdjective + preposition Meaning\npreposition in bold\n13.9.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120120 Sample sentence with the adjective and\nAdjective + preposition Meaning\npreposition in bold\nto feel or show anger toward (or about)\nangry at, about I am angry about the oil spill in the ocean.\nsomeone or something\nto be unable to think with clarity about Shawn was confused about the concepts\nconfused about\nsomeone or something. presented at the meeting.\nto feel dissatisfaction with someone or I was disappointed in my husband because he\ndisappointed in, with\nsomething voted for that candidate.\ndressed in to clothe the body He was dressed in a pin-striped suit.\nI was happy for my sister who graduated from\nhappy for to show happiness for someone or something\ncollege.\ngiving attention to something, expressing\ninterested in I am interested in musical theater.\ninterest\nto feel resentful or bitter toward someone or\nI was jealous of her because she always went\njealous of something (because of their status,\non vacation.\npossessions, or ability)\nthankful for to express thanks for something I am thankful for my wonderful friends.\ntired of to be disgusted with, have a distaste for I was tired of driving for hours without end.\nworried about to express anxiety or worry about something I am worried about my father\u2019s health.\nExercise 13.9.3\nComplete the following sentences by choosing the correct adjective and preposition combination to follow the verb.\n1.

Right now, you may be surrounded by desks, computers, and\nnotebooks. These are called count nouns because you can count the exact number of desks, computers, and notebooks\u2014three\ndesks, one computer, and six notebooks, for example.\nOn the other hand, you may be carrying a small amount of money in your wallet and sitting on a piece of furniture. These are called\nnoncount nouns. Although you can count the pieces of furniture or the amount of money, you cannot add a number in front of\nmoney or furniture and simply add \u2013s to the end of the noun. Instead, you must use other words and phrases to indicate the quantity\nof money and furniture.\nIncorrect: five moneys, two furnitures\nCorrect: some money, two pieces of furniture\nCount nouns\nA count noun refers to people, places, and things that are separate units. You make count nouns plural by adding \u2013s.\nCount nouns\nCount noun Sample sentence with a plural count noun in bold\nquarter It takes six quarters to do my laundry.\nchair Make sure to push in your chairs before leaving class.\ncandidate The two candidates debated the issue.\nadult The three adults in the room acted like children.\ncomedian The two comedians made the audience laugh.\nNoncount nouns\nA noncount noun identifies a whole object that cannot separate and count individually. Noncount nouns may refer to concrete\nobjects or abstract objects. A concrete noun identifies an object you can see, taste, touch, or count. An abstract noun identifies an\nobject that you cannot see, touch, or count. There are some exceptions, but most abstract nouns cannot be made plural, so they are\nnoncount nouns. Examples of abstract nouns include anger, education, melancholy, softness, violence, and conduct.\nTypes of noncount nouns\nSample sentences with noncount nouns in\nType of noncount noun Examples\nbold\nfoods sugar, salt, pepper, lettuce, rice Add more sugar to my coffee, please.\nThe ice cream was covered in creamy\nsolids concrete, chocolate, silver, soap\nchocolate.\nI need more information about the insurance\nabstract nouns peace, warmth, hospitality, information\npolicy.\n13.10.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120118 Exercise 13.10.1\nLabel each of the following nouns as count or noncount.\n1. electricity\n2. water\n3. book\n4. sculpture\n5. advice\nExercise 13.10.2\nIdentify all the noncount nouns in the sentences below.\n1.

I prefer film cameras instead of digital ones.\n5. My favorite subject is history.\nDefinite and indefinite articles\nThe word the is a definite article. It refers to one or more specific things. For example, the woman refers to not any woman but a\nparticular woman.

If the modifier is not right next to the word or phrase it\ndescribes, readers may not be able to tell what it is doing in the sentence. The two common types of modifier errors are called\nmisplaced modifiers and dangling modifiers.\nMisplaced modifiers\nA misplaced modifier is a modifier that is placed too far from the word or words it modifies. Misplaced modifiers make the\nsentence awkward and sometimes unintentionally humorous.\nMisplaced modifying phrases\nOften a modifier is a whole phrase or clause that expresses an idea about another part of the sentence.\nExamples of misplaced modifiers\nSample sentence with the modifier in bold Explanation\nIncorrect: This version makes it sound as if her head was too large. Of\nShe wore a bicycle helmet on her head that was too large. course, the writer is referring to the helmet, not to the person\u2019s head.\nCorrect: This version places the modifier that was too large next to the\nShe wore a bicycle helmet that was too large on her head. noun it modifies, helmet.\nIncorrect: This version suggests that the brother\u2019s name is Shadow.\nThat\u2019s because the modifier they call Shadow is too far from the word it\nThey bought a kitten for my brother they call Shadow.\nmodifies, kitten.\nCorrect: Now the modifier they call Shadow comes right after the noun\nThey bought a kitten they call Shadow for my brother. it modifies, kitten.\nIncorrect: The modifier with stomach pains comes right after nurse\nThe patient was referred to the nurse practitioner with stomach practitioner, so the sentence reads as if it is the nurse practitioner who\npains. has stomach pains.\nCorrect: Now the modifier with stomach pains comes right after the\nThe patient with stomach pains was referred to the nurse\npatient, so it is clear who is suffering.\npractitioner.\nMisplaced simple modifiers\nA modifier can also be a single word.

If we list two or more things, we should try to refer\nto those things using the same grammatical form. Parallelism creates a sense of rhythm and balance within a sentence. We often\ncorrect faulty parallelism intuitively because an unbalanced sentence sounds awkward and poorly constructed. Repetition of\ngrammatical construction makes the sentence flow and minimizes the amount of work the reader has to do to make sense of it. Try\nreading the following sentences aloud:\nExamples of correct and incorrect parallelism\nSentences with parallel items in bold Explanation\nIncorrect: Each item in the list is a verb in a different form: to iron, do\nKelly had to iron, do the washing, and shopping before her\nthe washing, and shopping.\nparents arrived.\nCorrect: Now the items in the list all have the same -ing verb\nKelly had to do the ironing, washing, and shopping before her\nform: ironing, washing, and shopping.\nparents arrived.\nIncorrect: The list begins with a noun, coordination, but ends with a\nDriving a car requires coordination, patience, and to have good\nphrase, to have good eyesight.\neyesight.\nCorrect: Each item in the list is in noun form: coordination, patience,\nDriving a car requires coordination, patience, and good\nand good eyesight.\neyesight.\nIncorrect: Jeans is a noun, but wearing a suit is a verbal phrase.\nAli prefers jeans to wearing a suit.\nCorrect: Now the sentence lines up one verbal phrase, wearing jeans,\nAli prefers wearing jeans to wearing a suit. next to another, wearing a suit.\nTip\nA simple way to check for parallelism in your writing is to make sure you have paired nouns with nouns, verbs with verbs,\nprepositional phrases with prepositional phrases, and so on. Underline each element in a sentence and check that the\ncorresponding element uses the same grammatical form.\nHow to create parallelism\nParallelism may be created by connecting two clauses or making a list using coordinating conjunctions; by comparing two items\nusing than or as; or by connecting two parts of a sentence using correlative conjunctions.\nCreating parallelism using coordinating conjunctions\nWhen you connect two clauses using a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), make sure that the same\ngrammatical structure is used on each side of the conjunction. Take a look at the following example:\n13.13.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120592 Faulty parallelism: When I walk the dog, I like to listen to music and talking to friends on the phone.\nCorrect parallelism: When I walk the dog, I like listening to music and talking to friends on the phone.\nThe first sentence uses two different verb forms (to listen, talking). In the second sentence, the grammatical construction on each\nside of the coordinating conjunction (and) is the same, creating a parallel sentence.\nThe same technique should be used for joining items or lists in a series:\nFaulty parallelism: This committee needs to decide whether the company should reduce its workforce, cut its benefits,\nor lowering workers\u2019 wages.\nCorrect parallelism: This committee needs to decide whether the company should reduce its workforce, cut its benefits,\nor lower workers\u2019 wages.\nThe first sentence contains two items that use the same verb construction (reduce, cut) and a third item that uses a different verb\nform (lowering). The second sentence uses the same verb construction in all three items, creating a parallel structure.\nExercise 13.13.1\nRevise each of the following sentences to create parallel structure using coordinating conjunctions.\n1. Mr. Holloway enjoys reading and to play his guitar at weekends.\n2. The doctor told Mrs. Franklin that she should either eat less or should exercise more.\n3. Breaking out of the prison compound, the escapees moved carefully, quietly, and were quick on their feet.\n4. I have read the book, but I have not watched the movie version.\n5. Deal with a full inbox first thing in the morning, or by setting aside short periods of time in which to answer e-mail queries.\nCreating parallelism using than or as\nWhen you are making a comparison, the two items being compared should have a parallel structure. Comparing two items without\nusing parallel structure can lead to confusion about what is being compared. Comparisons frequently use the words than or as, and\nthe items on each side of these comparison words should be parallel. Take a look at the following example:\nFaulty parallelism: Swimming in the ocean is much tougher than a pool.\nCorrect parallelism: Swimming in the ocean is much tougher than swimming in a pool.\nIn the first sentence, the elements before the comparison word (than) are not equal to the elements after the comparison word. It\nappears that the writer is comparing an action (swimming) with a noun (a pool). In the second sentence, the writer uses the same\ngrammatical construction to create a parallel structure. This clarifies that an action is being compared with another action.\nTo correct some instances of faulty parallelism, it may be necessary to add or delete words in a sentence.\nFaulty parallelism: A brisk walk is as beneficial to your health as going for a run.\nCorrect parallelism: Going for a brisk walk is as beneficial to your health as going for a run.\nIn this example, it is necessary to add the verb phrase going for to the sentence in order to clarify that the act of walking is being\ncompared to the act of running.\nExercise 13.13.2\nRevise each of the following sentences to create parallel structure using than or as.\n1. I would rather work at a second job to pay for a new car than a loan.\n2. How you look in the workplace is just as important as your behavior.\n3. The firefighter spoke more of his childhood than he talked about his job.\n4. Indian cuisine is far tastier than the food of Great Britain.\n5. Jim\u2019s opponent was as tall as Jim and he carried far more weight.\n13.13.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120592 Creating parallelism using correlative conjunctions\nA correlative conjunction is a paired conjunction that connects two equal parts of a sentence and shows the relationship between\nthem. Common correlative conjunctions include the following:\neither\u2026or\nnot only\u2026but also\nneither\u2026nor\nwhether\u2026or\nrather\u2026than\nboth\u2026and\nCorrelative conjunctions should follow the same grammatical structure to create a parallel sentence. Take a look at the following\nexample:\nFaulty parallelism: We can neither wait for something to happen nor can we take evasive action.\nCorrect parallelism: We can neither wait for something to happen nor take evasive action.\nWhen using a correlative conjunction, the words, phrases, or clauses following each part should be parallel. In the first sentence,\nthe construction of the second part of the sentence does not match the construction of the first part. In the second sentence, omitting\nneedless words and matching verb constructions create a parallel structure. Sometimes, rearranging a sentence corrects faulty\nparallelism.\nFaulty parallelism: It was both a long movie and poorly written.\nCorrect parallelism: The movie was both long and poorly written.\nTip\nTo see examples of parallelism in use, read some of the great historical speeches by rhetoricians such as Abraham Lincoln and\nMartin Luther King Jr. Notice how they use parallel structures to emphasize important points and to create a smooth, easily\nunderstandable oration. You may want to watch and listen to Martin Luther King\u2019s speech \u201cI Have a Dream.\"\nExercise 13.13.3\nRevise each of the following sentences to create parallel structure using correlative conjunctions.\n1. The cyclist owns both a mountain bike and has a racing bike.\n2. The movie not only contained lots of action, but also it offered an important lesson.\n3. My current job is neither exciting nor is it meaningful.\n4. Jason would rather listen to his father than be taking advice from me.\n5. We are neither interested in buying a vacuum cleaner nor do we want to utilize your carpet cleaning service.\nExercise 13.13.4\nRead through the following paragraph, and revise any instances of faulty parallelism to create parallel structure.\nOwning a pet has proven to be extremely beneficial to people's health. Pets help lower blood pressure, boost immunity, and are\nlessening anxiety. Studies indicate that children who grow up in a household with cats or dogs are at a lower risk of developing\nallergies or suffer from asthma. Owning a dog offers an additional bonus; it makes people more sociable. Dogs are natural\nconversation starters and this not only helps to draw people out of social isolation but also they are more likely to find a\nromantic partner. Benefits of pet ownership for elderly people include less anxiety, lower insurance costs, and they also gain\npeace of mind. A study of Alzheimer's patients showed that patients have fewer anxious outbursts if there is an animal in the\nhome. Some doctors even keep dogs in the office to act as on-site therapists. In short, owning a pet keeps you healthy, happy,\nand is a great way to help you relax.\n13.13.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120592 Attributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing for Success, created by an author and publisher who prefer to remain anonymous, adapted and\npresented by the Saylor Foundation and licensed CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\n13.13: Parallelism is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n13.13.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120592 13.14: Using Quotation Marks\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (4 min, 45 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 44::4455\nQuotation marks (\u201c \u201d) set off a group of words from the rest of the text.

Quotation marks always appear in pairs.\nDirect Quotations\nA direct quotation is an exact account of what someone said or wrote. To include a direct quotation in your writing, enclose the\nwords in quotation marks. An indirect quotation is a restatement of what someone said or wrote. An indirect quotation does not use\nthe person\u2019s exact words.

When using identifying words in the\nmiddle of the quote, the beginning of the second part of the quote does not need to be capitalized.\nUse commas between identifying words and quotes. Quotation marks must be placed after commas and periods.

There are several ways to work a quotation in\nso that it flows smoothly and fits logically and grammatically with our own words. Let's say we want to integrate the following\nopening sentence from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, as an example:\n\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\u201d\nBelow are three methods for bringing this quotation into a sentence.\nSeamless Integration Method\nEmbed the quoted words, either a phrase or a whole sentence, as if they were an organic part of your sentence. With this method, if\nyou read the sentence aloud, your listeners would not know there was a quotation. With this method, no additional punctuation is\nadded before the quote. Here is an example:\nCharles Dickens begins his novel with the paradoxical observation that the eighteenth century was both \u201cthe best of times\u201d and\n\u201cthe worst of times\u201d [1].\nSignal Phrase Method\nUse a signal phrase (author + verb) to introduce the quotation, clearly indicating that the quotation comes from a specific source.\nSee 12.5: Quoting and Paraphrasing for more on choosing signal phrases. Use a comma after the signal phrase and before the\nquotation, as in the example below:\nDescribing the eighteenth century, Charles Dickens observes, \u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\u201d [1].\nIf you use the word that with your signal phrase in the pattern (author + verb + that), however, omit the comma and do not\ncapitalize the first word in the quote, as in this version:\nDescribing the eighteenth century, Charles Dickens observes that \u201cit was the best of times, it was the worst of times\u201d [1].\nColon Method\nIf your own introductory words form a complete sentence, you can use a colon to introduce and set off the quotation. This can give\nthe quotation added emphasis.\nDickens defines the eighteenth century as a time of paradox: \u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\u201d [1].\nAttributions\nAdapted by Anna Mills from \"Appendix C: Integrating Source Evidence into Your Writing\" by Suzan Last and Candice Neveu\nin Technical Writing Essentials, provided by BCcampus, licensed CC BY 4.0.\n13.15: Fitting a Quotation into a Sentence is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n13.15.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/127361 13.16: Commas\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (12 min, 28 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 1122::2288\nOverview of commas\nOne of the punctuation clues to reading you may encounter is the comma. The comma is a punctuation mark that indicates a pause\nin a sentence or a separation of things in a list. Commas can be used in a variety of ways. Look at some of the following sentences\nto see how you might use a comma when writing a sentence.\nIntroductory word: Personally, I think the practice is helpful.\nLists: The barn, the tool shed, and the back porch were destroyed by the wind.\nCoordinating adjectives: He was tired, hungry, and late.\nConjunctions in compound sentences: The bedroom door was closed, so the children knew their mother was asleep.\nInterrupting words: I knew where it was hidden, of course, but I wanted them to find it themselves.\nDates, addresses, greetings, and letters: The letter was postmarked December 8, 1945.\nCommas after an introductory word or phrase\nYou may notice a comma that appears near the beginning of the sentence, usually after a word or phrase. This comma lets the\nreader know where the introductory word or phrase ends and the main sentence begins.\nWithout spoiling the surprise, we need to tell her to save the date.\nIn the sentence above, without spoiling the surprise is an introductory phrase, while we need to tell her to save the date is the main\nsentence. Notice how they are separated by a comma. When only an introductory word appears in the sentence, a comma also\nfollows the introductory word.\nIronically, she already had plans for that day.\nExercise 13.16.1\nAdd a comma after the introductory word or phrase to correct the sentence.\n1. Suddenly the dog ran into the house.\n2. In the blink of an eye the kids were ready to go to the movies.\n3. Confused he tried opening the box from the other end.\n4. Every year we go camping in the woods.\n5. Without a doubt green is my favorite color.\n6. Hesitating she looked back at the directions before proceeding.\n7. Fortunately the sleeping baby did not stir when the doorbell rang.\n8. Believe it or not the criminal was able to rob the same bank three times.\nCommas in a list of items\nWhen you want to list several nouns in a sentence, you separate each word with a comma. This allows the reader to pause after\neach item and identify which words are included in the grouping. When you list items in a sentence, put a comma after each noun,\nthen add the word and before the last item. However, you do not need to include a comma after the last item.\nWe\u2019ll need to get flour, tomatoes, and cheese at the store.\nThe pizza will be topped with olives, peppers, and pineapple chunks.\n13.16.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120109 Commas and coordinating adjectives\nYou can use commas to list both adjectives and nouns. A string of adjectives that describe a noun are called coordinating\nadjectives. These adjectives come before the noun they modify and are separated by commas. One important thing to note,\nhowever, is that unlike listing nouns, the word and does not always need to be before the last adjective.\nIt was a bright, windy, clear day.\nOur kite glowed red, yellow, and blue in the morning sunlight.\nExercise 13.16.2\nAdd commas to the following sentences as needed.\n1. Monday Tuesday and Wednesday are all booked with meetings.\n2. It was a quiet uneventful unproductive day.\n3. We\u2019ll need to prepare statements for the Franks Todds and Smiths before their portfolio reviews next week.\n4. Michael Nita and Desmond finished their report last Tuesday.\n5. With cold wet aching fingers he was able to secure the sails before the storm.\n6. He wrote his name on the board in clear precise delicate letters.\nCommas before conjunctions in compound sentences\nCommas are sometimes used to separate two independent clauses. The comma comes after the first independent clause and is\nfollowed by a conjunction, such as for, and, or but.\nHe missed class today, and he thinks he will be out tomorrow, too.\nHe says his fever is gone, but he is still very tired.\nExercise 13.16.3\nFor each pair of sentences below, combine the two independent clauses with a comma and a coordinating conjunction.\n1. The presentation was scheduled for Monday. The weather delayed the presentation for four days.\n2. He wanted a snack before bedtime. He ate some fruit.\n3. The patient is in the next room. I can hardly hear anything.\n4. We could go camping for vacation. We could go to the beach for vacation.\n5. I want to get a better job. I am taking courses at night.\n6. I cannot move forward on this project. I cannot afford to stop on this project.\n7. Patrice wants to stop for lunch. We will take the next exit to look for a restaurant.\n8. I\u2019ve got to get this paper done. I have class in ten minutes.\n9. The weather was clear yesterday. We decided to go on a picnic.\n10. I have never dealt with this client before. I know Leonardo has worked with them. Let\u2019s ask Leonardo for his help.\nCommas before and after interrupting words\nIn conversations, you might interrupt your train of thought by giving more details about what you are talking about. In a sentence,\nyou might interrupt your train of thought with a word or phrase called interrupting words. Interrupting words can come at the\nbeginning or middle of a sentence. When the interrupting words appear at the beginning of the sentence, a comma appears after the\nword or phrase.\nIf you can believe it, people once thought the sun and planets orbited around Earth.\nLuckily, some people questioned that theory.\nWhen interrupting words come in the middle of a sentence, they are separated from the rest of the sentence by commas. You can\ndetermine where the commas should go by looking for the part of the sentence that is not essential for the sentence to make sense.\nAn Italian astronomer, Galileo, proved that Earth orbited the sun.\n13.16.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120109 We have known, for hundreds of years now, that the Earth and other planets exist in a solar system.\nExercise 13.16.4\nInsert commas in the sentences below to separate the interrupting words from the rest of the sentence.\n1. I asked my neighbors the retired couple from Florida to bring in my mail.\n2. Without a doubt his work has improved over the last few weeks.\n3. Our professor Professor Alamut never lectured; they always made us come up with discussion questions.\n4. The meeting is at noon unfortunately which means I will be late for lunch.\n5. We came in time for the last part of dinner but most importantly we came in time for dessert.\n6. All of a sudden our network crashed and we lost our files.\n7. Sofia hand the wrench to me before the pipe comes loose again.\nCommas in dates, addresses, and the greetings and closings of letters\nYou also use commas when you write the date, such as in cover letters and e-mails. Commas are used when you write the date,\nwhen you include an address, and when you greet someone.\nIf you are writing out the full date, add a comma after the day and before the year. You do not need to add a comma when you write\nthe month and day or when you write the month and the year. If you need to continue the sentence after you add a date that includes\nthe day and year, add a comma after the end of the date.\nThe letter is postmarked May 4, 2001.\nHer birthday is May 5.\nHe visited the country in July 2009.\nI registered for the conference on March 7, 2010, so we should get our tickets soon.\nYou also use commas when you include addresses and locations. When you include an address in a sentence, be sure to place a\ncomma after the street and after the city. Do not place a comma between the state and the zip code. Like a date, if you need to\ncontinue the sentence after adding the address, simply add a comma after the address.\nWe moved to 4542 Boxcutter Lane, Hope, Missouri 70832.\nAfter moving to Boston, Massachusetts, Eric used public transportation to get to work.\nGreetings are also separated by commas. When you write an e-mail or a letter, you add a comma after the greeting word or the\nperson\u2019s name. You also need to include a comma after the closing, which is the word or phrase you put before your signature.\nExample 13.16.1\nHello,\nI would like more information about your job posting.\nThank you,\nAnita Al-Sayf\nDear Mrs. Al-Sayf,\nThank you for your letter. Please read the attached document for details.\nSincerely,\nJack Fromont\nExercise 13.16.5\nAdd commas as needed to the following letter.\nMarch 27 2010\nAlexa March\u00e9\n14 Taylor Drive Apt. 6\n13.16.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120109 New Castle Maine 90342\nDear Mr. Jian\nThank you for agreeing to meet with me.

My brother Nathaniel is a collector of many rare unusual things. He has collected lunch boxes limited edition books and\nhatpins at various points of his life. His current collection of unusual bottles has over fifty pieces. Usually he sells one\ncollection before starting another.\n2. Our meeting is scheduled for Thursday March 20. In that time we need to gather all our documents together. Alice is in\ncharge of the timetables and schedules. Tom is in charge of updating the guidelines. I am in charge of the presentation. To\nprepare for this meeting please print out any e-mails faxes or documents you have referred to when writing your sample.\n3. It was a cool crisp autumn day when the group set out. They needed to cover several miles before they made camp so they\nwalked at a brisk pace. The leader of the group Aviva kept checking her watch and their GPS location.

Relying on a period to separate the related clauses into two\nshorter sentences could lead to choppy writing. Using a comma would create an awkward run-on sentence. Note that writing\nindependent clauses as two sentences separated by a period is correct. However, sometimes having two short sentences in a row\ncan sound choppy. Using a semicolon to combine two clauses that are clearly connected can help avoid the choppiness and\nunderscore the connection in meaning, as in the example below.\nCorrect: Be sure to wear clean, well-pressed clothes to the interview; appearances are important.\nCorrect but choppy: Be sure to wear clean, well-pressed clothes to the interview. Appearances are important.\nIncorrect: Be sure to wear clean, well-pressed clothes to the interview, appearances are important.\nTip\nA semicolon on its own can join two main clauses. But what if there is also a connecting word joining the clauses? Use a\nsemicolon before a conjunctive adverb such as however or therefore, but do not use a semicolon with a coordinating\nconjunction such as and, or, and but.\nSemicolons to join items in a list\nYou can also use a semicolon to join items in a list when the items in the list already require commas. Semicolons help the reader\ndistinguish between items in the list. By using semicolons in the example below, the reader can easily distinguish between the three\nsets of colors.\nCorrect: The color combinations we can choose from are black, white, and grey; green, brown, and black; or red, green, and\nbrown.\nIncorrect: The color combinations we can choose from are black, white, and grey, green, brown, and black, or red, green, and\nbrown.\nExercise 13.17.1\nCorrect the following sentences by adding semicolons as needed. In some cases, no correction may be needed.\n1. I did not notice that you were in the office I was behind the front desk all day.\n2. Do you want turkey, spinach, and cheese roast beef, lettuce, and cheese or ham, tomato, and cheese?\n3. Please close the blinds there is a glare on the screen.\n4. Unbelievably, no one was hurt in the accident.\n5. I cannot decide if I want my room to be green, brown, and purple green, black, and brown or green, brown, and dark red.\n6. Let\u2019s go for a walk the air is so refreshing.\n13.17.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120110 Colons\nColons to introduce a list\nUse a colon to introduce a list of items. Introduce the list with an independent clause, as in the examples below.\nThe team will tour three states: New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.\nI have to take four classes this semester: Composition, Statistics, Ethics, and Italian.\nColons to introduce quotations\nYou can use a colon to introduce a quote as long as the words before the quote form a complete sentence in themselves, as in the\nfollowing example.\nMark Twain said it best: \u201cWhen in doubt, tell the truth.\u201d\nIf a quote is longer than forty words, skip a line after the colon and indent the left margin of the quote five spaces. Long quotations,\nwhich are forty words or more, are called block quotations. Block quotations frequently appear in longer essays and research\npapers. Because quotations longer than forty words use line spacing and indentation to indicate a quote, quotation marks are not\nnecessary, as in the example below.\nMy father always loved Mark Twain\u2019s words:\nThere are basically two types of people. People who accomplish things, and people who claim to have accomplished\nthings. The first group is less crowded.\nColons to introduce examples or explanations\nUse a colon to introduce an example or to further explain an idea presented in the first part of a sentence. The first part of the\nsentence must always be an independent clause; that is, it must stand alone as a complete thought with a subject and verb. Do not\nuse a colon after phrases like such as or for example.\nCorrect: Our company offers many publishing services: writing, editing, and reviewing.\nIncorrect: Our company offers many publishing services, such as: writing, editing, and reviewing.\nCapitalization after colons\nCapitalize the first letter following a colon for a proper noun, the beginning of a quote, or the first letter of another independent\nclause. Do NOT capitalize if the information following the colon is not a complete sentence.\nProper noun: We visited three countries: Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.\nBeginning of a quote: My mother loved this line from Hamlet: \u201cTo thine own self be true.\u201d\nTwo independent clauses: There are drawbacks to modern technology: My brother\u2019s cell phone died and he lost a lot of\nphone numbers.\nIncorrect: The recipe is simple: Tomato, basil, and avocado.\nExercise 13.17.2\nCorrect the following sentences by adding semicolons or colons as needed. In some cases, no semicolon or colon should be\nadded.\n1. Don\u2019t give up you never know what tomorrow brings.\n2. Our records show that the patient was admitted on March 9, 2010 January 13, 2010 and November 16, 2009.\n3. Allow me to introduce myself I am the greatest ice-carver in the world.\n4. Where I come from there are three ways to get to the grocery store by car, by bus, and by foot.\n5.

To show possession with a singular noun, add \u2019s.\nExamples of possessive apostrophes with singular nouns\nSample sentence with the possessive apostrophe and s in bold Explanation\nThe dance routine belongs to Ibrahim, so 's is added after Ibrahim's\nIbrahim\u2019s dance routine mesmerized everyone in the room.\nname.\nThe dog\u2019s leash is hanging on the hook beside the door. The leash belongs to the dog, so 's is added after the dog.\nJess\u2019s sister is also coming to the party. The sister referred to is the sister of Jess, so 's is added to Jess.\nNotice that singular nouns that end in s still take the apostrophe s (\u2019s) ending to show possession. See \"Should I use its or\nit's\" below for one exception: we do not add an apostrophe to make the singular pronoun it possessive; we only add an s.\nPlural nouns\nTo show possession with a plural noun that ends in s, just add an apostrophe (\u2019). If the plural noun does not end in s, add an\napostrophe and an s (\u2019s).\nExamples of possessive apostrophes with plural nouns\nSample sentence with the possessive apostrophe and s in bold Explanation\nDrummers is a plural noun that ends in s, so we add an apostrophe but\nThe drummers\u2019 sticks all moved in the same rhythm, like a machine.\nno additional s after the apostrophe.\nThe people\u2019s votes clearly showed that no one supported the People is a plural noun that does not end in s, so we add an apostrophe\nmanagement decision. and an s.\nContractions\nA contraction is a word that is formed by combining two words. In a contraction, an apostrophe shows where one or more letters\nhave been left out. Contractions are commonly used in informal writing but not in formal writing.\nFor example, \"I do not like ice cream\" becomes \"I don\u2019t like ice cream.\" The words do and not have been combined to form the\ncontraction don\u2019t. The apostrophe shows where the o in not has been left out.\nCommonly Used Contractions\nContraction Original Words\naren't are not\ncan\u2019t cannot\ndoesn\u2019t does not\n13.18.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120113 Contraction Original Words\ndon\u2019t do not\nisn\u2019t is not\nhe\u2019ll he will\nI\u2019ll I will\nshe\u2019ll she will\nthey\u2019ll they will\nyou\u2019ll you will\nit\u2019s it is, it has\nlet\u2019s let us\nshe\u2019s she is, she has\nthere\u2019s there is, there has\nwho\u2019s who is, who has\nShould I use it's or its?\nMany writers confuse the possessive form its with the contraction it's. Its is a possessive pronoun. It\u2019s is a contraction of the words\nit and is. When in doubt, substitute the words it is in a sentence. If the sentence still makes sense, use the contraction it\u2019s.\nExamples of its and it's\nSample sentence with its or it's in bold Explanation\nIt\u2019s cold and rainy outside. It is cold and rainy outside, so we use the contraction it's.\nThe cat was chasing its tail.

A writing style can give pleasure through elegant, graceful, and\npleasing word combinations.\nHowever, most writers and teachers of writing agree that clarity should be our first goal. Any stylistic choices we make should also\nhelp our readers understand our points. In turn, writing clearly will generally make for good style. British poet Matthew Arnold\nadvised \"Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is the only secret of style.\"1\nPhoto by Justin Katigbak of Disabled And Here, licensed CC BY 4.0.\nAvoid academese\nProfessors and students alike can be tempted to write in a wordy, complex, self-consciously scholarly style. This is an\nunderstandable mistake. We want to make our words sound formal and authoritative in part because, in the past, academic culture\nhas favored such an ornamented style. Some call it \u201cacademese.\u201d Compare the following two versions of a sentence:\nAcademese style: \u201cTo satisfy her hunger for nutrition, she consumed the bread.\u201d\nStraightforward style: \u201cShe was hungry, so she ate the bread.\u201d1\nClearly, the academese style runs the risk of becoming tedious and alienating readers. Unnecessary jargon, fancy vocabulary, and\nconvoluted sentences can make anything harder to understand.\nThe academese style also signals elitism. It shows off a high level of education. As Joseph Williams puts it, \"it is a language of\nexclusion that a diverse and democratic society cannot tolerate.\"2 The culture is shifting among scholars to favor plainer language\nand insist on clarity. Readers, including professors, are much more likely to find a self-consciously highbrow writing style\nannoying rather than impressive. As the saying goes3, any fool can make simple things complicated; it takes a genius to make\ncomplicated things simple.\nOf course, as writers we look for ways to develop confidence in our voices, to take ourselves seriously and make sure we are taken\nseriously. We can develop this sense of confidence, however, without fancy vocabulary or a hyper-formal, fussy style. Removing\nthe pressure to sound academic can be a relief. Sometimes we can just say something very bluntly and simply and leave it at that.\n14.1.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27132 Confidence will come as we clarify our thinking, and writing in a straightforward style can help us to do that. Unclear and bloated\nprose gets in the way, both for the writer and the reader. Focusing on saying plainly what we mean can free us up to make\nintellectual progress.\nConfidence, directness, and simplicity in writing inspire trust, as they do in in-person interactions.\nPhoto by Paula Bronstein for the Hewlett Foundation's Images of Empowerment, licensed CC BY NC 4.0.\nDon't worry about style until the end\nThe best way to achieve clarity and concision in writing is to separate the drafting process from the revision process. Experienced\nwriters routinely produce vague, tortuous, and bloated drafts, and are happy to do so. It usually means that we're onto an interesting\nidea. We may express the same idea in three or four different ways as we're getting thoughts down on paper. That\u2019s fine. In fact,\neach repetition helps us develop key ideas and alternative approaches to conveying them. A snarly first draft is often a great\nachievement. We just need to allow ourselves the time at the end of the writing process to revise for clarity and concision (See\nChapter 11: The Writing Process).\nOnce we have our ideas clear, it will be easier to write effective sentences. Editing for style can then be a satisfying and not overly\nburdensome part of the process. One common metaphor notes that a good edit is like the last twist of a camera lens that brings the\nwhole picture into focus. In the following sections we will look at ways to edit sentences for clarity, concision, balance, and variety.\nAttribution\nAdapted by Anna Mills from Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence by Amy Guptill, published by Open SUNY\nTextbooks, licensed CC BY NC SA 4.0.\nReferences\n1Michael Harvey, The Nuts and Bolts of College Writing.

In drafting, we are still\nthinking our ideas out and searching for the best way to articulate it. However, readers often don't want to read all those versions of\nthe same thing. If we can cut out repetition in the final version, we can create a more lively, interesting, and focused piece. Cutting\nout excess wordiness can help make space for new, related ideas and a stronger argument.\nReaders may roll their eyes when writers go on and on.\n\"Eye Roll\" by Jaysin Trevino on Flickr is licensed CC BY 2.0.\nA general rule to go by is that every word and sentence should be doing some significant work for the paper as a whole. Sometimes\nthat work is more to provide pleasure than meaning\u2014we needn\u2019t ruthlessly eliminate every flourish\u2014but each phrase in the final\nversion should add something unique to the paper.\nOf course, we may be tempted to add padding to our writing to meet the length criteria for an assignment. But such padding will be\ntedious for readers, including the instructor. Often, instructors require a certain word count because they can't imagine a shorter\npiece of writing meeting the goals of the assignment. If our writing isn't long enough yet, a good first move is to go back to the\nassignment description and see if there's anything we haven't fully addressed.\nMichael Harvey1 notes that sometimes we may be reluctant to write concisely because it makes us feel more vulnerable.\nWordiness may seem to add to our academic credibility, and it can cover over areas of uncertainty. Harvey writes,\n[M]any of us are afraid of writing concisely because doing so can make us feel exposed. Concision leaves us fewer words to\nhide behind. Our insights and ideas might appear puny stripped of those inessential words, phrases, and sentences in which we\nrough them out. We might even wonder, were we to cut out the fat, would anything be left?\nAs writers, we may need encouragement from peers and teachers to gradually gain confidence and trust that our ideas, even in their\nbarest, simplest forms, are worthwhile. Others will take our writing seriously when it is clear and substantive.\nStrategies for eliminating wordiness\nIt's best to wait until the final stage of the revision process to look for wordiness. (For more on how to prioritize, see Chapter 11:\nThe Writing Process.) Then, we can try the strategies below. The more we do this, the more it will become second nature.\n14.2.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27134 1. Look for words and phrases that you can cut entirely. Some bits may be redundant or meaningless, as in the following phrases,\nwhere the italicized words can be cut:\neach and every\nunexpected surprise\npredictions about the future\nvery unique\ncertain factors\nslightly terrifying\n2. Look for opportunities to replace longer phrases with shorter phrases or words. For example, \u201cthe way in which\u201d can often be\nreplaced by \u201chow\u201d and \u201cdespite the fact that\u201d can usually be replaced by \u201calthough.\u201d Strong, precise verbs can often replace\nbloated phrases. Consider this example: \u201cThe goal of Alexander the Great was to create a united empire across a vast distance.\u201d\nAnd compare it to this: \u201cAlexander the Great sought to unite a vast empire.\u201d\n3. Try to rearrange sentences or passages to make them shorter and livelier. Williams and Bizup2 recommend changing negatives\nto affirmatives. Consider the negatives in this sentence: \u201cSchool nurses often do not notice if a young schoolchild does not have\nadequate food at home.\u201d You could more concisely and clearly write, \u201cSchool nurses rarely notice if a young schoolchild lacks\nadequate food at home.\u201d It says the same thing, but is much easier to read which makes for a happier and more engaged reader.\n4. Good parallelism can also help us write shorter text that better conveys our thinking. For example, Stacy Schiff writes this in\nher best-selling biography of Cleopatra3:\nA goddess as a child, a queen at eighteen, a celebrity soon thereafter, she was an object of speculation and veneration,\ngossip and legend, even in her own time.\nImagine if, instead, Schiff wrote this:\nCleopatra was seen as divine when she was a child. She became the sovereign ruler at eighteen, and she became well\nknown throughout the ancient world early in her reign. People speculated about her, worshipped her, gossiped about her,\nand told legends about her, even in her own time.\nThe second version says the same thing, but the extra words tend to obscure Schiff\u2019s point. The original (\u201cgoddess as a\nchild, queen at eighteen, celebrity soon thereafter\u201d) uses parallelism to vividly convey the dramatic shifts in Cleopatra\u2019s\nroles and her prominence in the ancient world. See 13.10: Parallelism for more on how to create parallel structure.\nExercise 14.2.1\nEdit these passages for concision, using the three moves described above. Be sure to preserve all of the meaning contained in\nthe original.\n1. Each and every student enrolled in our educational institutions deserves and is entitled to competent instruction in all of the\nkey academic areas of study.

Williams and Bizup offer another key point. They explain that readers\nexperience writing as clear when the \u201ccharacter\u201d of a sentence is also its grammatical subject and the key \u201caction\u201d a grammatical\nverb. They provide this fanciful example:1\nOnce upon a time, as a walk through the woods was taking place on the part of Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf\u2019s jump out\nfrom behind a tree caused her fright.\nGrammatically, the subject of the first part is \u201ca walk through the woods,\u201d and the verb is \u201ctaking place\u201d. The character, though, is\nobviously Little Red Riding Hood and the action is walking. A much more straightforward version\u2014\u201cAs Little Red Riding Hood\nwalked through the woods\u201d\u2014makes the character the subject and the action the key verb. That example goes out of its way to be\nsilly, but consider this example from a website offering free college papers:2\nAnother event that connects the colonist and the English together is the event of a hated King in England trying to take away\nfreedom and go back to the old ways. The idea of how much power the King had struck Parliament. After that, the Parliament\nand the people made the King sign the Magna Carta, which limits the amount of power the King has. The Magna Carta also\naffected the rights of the American colonies. It practically took away all relationships between the King and the colonies. After\nthe relationship was broken, America broke off from England.\nApparently, the author is claiming that the colonists (in the 1700s?) pushed back against the power of the English crown in a\nmanner similar to the Parliamentarians in 1215 (after having apparently been \u201cstruck\u201d by an \u201cidea\u201d of \u201chow much power the King\nhad\u201d). Grammatically, the subjects are an \u201cevent\u201d and an \u201cidea\u201d rather than the characters, colonists, the king, and Parliament. The\nthird sentence is refreshingly straightforward in structure (though vague on details). The fifth and sixth sentences are fairly\nstraightforward, but also incredibly vague: the Magna Carta predated the American colonies by at least 400 years3; how does that\ndocument relate to the American Revolution? The last sentence essentially says that after the relationship was broken, the\nrelationship was broken. If the author were to rewrite the passage to make the grammatical subjects match the characters, he or she\nwould be prompted to clarify what exactly the king, the Parliament, the English populace, and the American colonists did (and to\nwho), something which the author of the above passage may not actually understand. This example illustrates how clarifying \u201cwho\ndid what to whom\u201d for the reader also makes writers clarify it for themselves. Writing clearly involves thinking clearly, and clear\nrigorous thinking is why your professors assign you writing in the first place.\nWhile the Magna Carta example is comically bad, here\u2019s one that is more or less logical but would still benefit from greater clarity:\nIgE-dependent allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic asthma and food allergy involve mast cells which are\ntypically regarded as troublesome cells as a result. Further, the allergic sensitization-processes also involves a role for mast\ncells. Recent findings show that their functionality is not only pro-inflammatory, but can on the contrary have suppressive or\nimmunomodulatory effects in allergic inflammation.\nThe above passage isn\u2019t a terrible slog, and it\u2019s fairly clear that the whole passage is about mast cells. But here\u2019s a version of the\nsame passage\u2014the real version as it were\u2014which demonstrates that the passage feels a lot clearer when mast cells, the\n\u201ccharacters\u201d driving the narrative, are also the grammatical subject of the sentence and the referent for the key verbs:6\nMast cells are typically regarded as troublesome cells due to their prominent role in IgE-dependent allergic hypersensitivity\nreactions such as allergic asthma and food allergy. Further, it seems that mast cells are also able to play an additional role in the\n14.3.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27133 allergic sensitization-processes. Recent findings show that mast cell functionality is not only pro-inflammatory, but can on the\ncontrary have suppressive or immunomodulatory effects in allergic inflammation.\nBoth versions of the passage are consistently about mast cells, but the second version makes that consistency much more obvious\nto readers as mast cells are the main character of every sentence. That clear consistency allows us to devote more of our brain\npower to recalling technical terms (like immunomodulatory) and comprehending the key ideas. That makes it both easier and more\ninteresting to read.\nTo further illustrate the principle, let\u2019s take a nicely straightforward passage and rewrite it so that the characters are objects (rather\nthan subjects) and the actions are nouns7 (rather than verbs). Here\u2019s the nicely clear original:8\nWhat most people really feel nostalgic about has little to do with the internal structure of 1950s families. It is the belief that the\n1950s provided a more family-friendly economic and social environment, an easier climate in which to keep kids on the\nstraight and narrow, and above all, a greater feeling of hope for a family\u2019s long-term future, especially for its young.\nIn these two sentences, the character is a belief rather than a person or thing. However, the passage is still clear to the reader\nbecause it keeps the character consistent and explains what that character does (creates nostalgia) to who (people at large). Imagine\nif the author wrote this instead:\nPeople feel nostalgic not about the internal structure of 1950s families. Rather, the beliefs about how the 1950s provided a\nmore family-friendly economic and social environment, an easier climate in which to keep kids on the straight and narrow, and\nabove all, a greater feeling of hope for a family\u2019s long-term future (especially for its young) are what lead to those nostalgic\nfeelings.\nThis second version says substantially the same thing, but it\u2019s tedious to read because the character changes abruptly from \u201cpeople\u201d\nto \u201cbeliefs\u201d (which works against cohesion) and one has to get to the end of the sentence to learn how these beliefs fit in. The key\npoint is this: one of the best things you can do to revise for greater clarity is to recast a passage so that the characters are the\ngrammatical subjects and the key actions are the verbs.\nPractice Exercise 14.3.1\nRewrite these passages to make the \u201ccharacters\u201d the grammatical subjects and the key \u201cactions\u201d the verbs.

An elegant and apt turn of phrase is satisfying both to write and to read. While you can\u2019t\noften summon elegance out of nowhere, you can learn a few structures that are often pleasing to the reader\u2019s ear because they\nharmonize what you\u2019re saying with how you\u2019re saying it. Here are two rhetorical tricks that you can use to reinforce your points.\n1. Balance. Readers often find balanced sentences and phrases pleasing. The Cleopatra example above (\u201cgoddess as a child, queen\nat eighteen, celebrity soon thereafter\u201d) illustrates parallelism, which is one kind of balance: using parallel structures to convey a\nparallel idea. This parallelism not only helps Schiff be powerfully concise, it quickly and vividly conveys the idea that\nCleopatra led a remarkable life. Williams and Bizup1 offer another example of an elegant sentence in which the two parts are\nbalanced in their structure:\nA government that is unwilling to listen to the moderate hopes of its citizenry must eventually answer to the harsh justice of\nits revolutionaries.\nThe same sentence with the parallel parts marked in bold:\nA government that is unwilling to listen to the moderate hopes of its citizenry must eventually answer to the harsh\njustice of its revolutionaries.\nThe balanced structure and contrasting language reinforce the author\u2019s either-or point: \u201clisten\u201d or \u201canswer\u201d; \u201cmoderate hopes\u201d\nor \u201charsh justice\u201d, \u201ccitizenry\u201d or \u201crevolutionaries.\u201d The balanced structure adds rhetorical force to the argument.\n2. Emphasis. Read these sentences out loud, or imagine yourself doing so:\nVersion 1: But far and away, the largest weight-inducing food, out-stripping all others, was the potato chip.2\nVersion 2: But far and away, the potato chip was the largest weight-inducing food, out-stripping all others.\nThe first version places a particular rhetorical emphasis on \u201cthe potato chip\u201d because it comes last in the sentence after a three-part\nbuild-up. The second version says the exact same thing, and it isn\u2019t hard to see that \u201cpotato chip\u201d is the key part of the sentence.\nHowever, the rhetorical emphasis on \u201cthe potato chip\u201d is somewhat weaker. This common rhetorical trick is to put the part you\nwant to emphasize at the very end of the sentence.\nThese are just two rhetorical structures that scholars have identified. You can find others (Google \u201crhetorical device\u201d) that you can\nbring into your repertoire. Most people can\u2019t set out to write elegantly per se, and you certainly shouldn\u2019t spend your writing time\ncrafting elegantly balanced sentences that have little to do with your argument or analysis. But the more familiar you are with these\nrhetorical structures, the more often you can recognize and use them.\nReferences\n1Williams and Bizup, Style, 171.\n2Michael Moss, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us (New York: Random House, 2013), 328.\n14.4: Giving the Reader Pleasure is shared under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and\/or curated by LibreTexts.\n14.4.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27136 14.5: Understanding Convoluted Sentences\n\uf08d Media Alternative\nListen to an audio version of this page (3 min, 27 sec):\n00::0000 \/\/ 33::2277\nThere is less tolerance for academese than there used to be in scholarly communities; however, a lot of landmark texts were written\nin a time when there wasn\u2019t such a high value placed on clarity and concision.

In reading this passage, 1 imagine \u201cego\u201d and \u201calter\u201d as two people interacting:\nCommunication through a common system of symbols is the precondition of this reciprocity or complementarity of\nexpectations. The alternatives which are open to alter must have some measure of stability in two respects: first, as realistic\npossibilities for alter, and second, in their meaning to ego. This stability presupposes generalization from the particularity of\nthe given situations of ego and alter, both of which are continually changing and are never concretely identical over any two\nmoments in time. When such generalization occurs, and actions, gestures, or symbols have more or less the same meaning for\nboth ego and alter, we may speak of a common culture existing between them, through which their interaction is mediated.\nHere\u2019s a version after I edited for concision using the three moves described above:\nReciprocity, or complementary expectations, depends on a common system of symbols. The symbolic alternatives for alter\nmust be stable, in that they are both realistic for alter and meaningful to ego. That is, actions, gestures, or symbols must have a\nshared and persistent meaning for ego and alter even though ego and alter are in different situations and are constantly\nchanging. When meanings are shared and persistent, we may say that the interaction between alter and ego is mediated by a\ncommon culture.\nThe revised version is about 30 percent shorter, and it demonstrates how concision makes one\u2019s points come through more clearly.\nYou will almost certainly have to read works of authors who did not prioritize clarity and concision (or even cohesion and\ncoherence), and that\u2019s a drag. But knowing how wordiness interferes with clarity can help you distill essential meanings from\nchallenging texts. In many ways, writing well and reading incisively are two facets of the same cognitive skill set.\n14.5.1 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/27135 Practice Exercise 14.5.1\nTake these straightforward passages and make them less clear without changing the meaning.

Just as a meal might lack the finishing touches needed to spice it up, so too might a paragraph contain all the basic\ncomponents but still lack the stylistic finesse required to engage a reader. Sometimes writers have a tendency to reuse the same\nsentence pattern throughout their writing. Like any repetitive task, reading text that contains too many sentences with the same\nlength and structure can become monotonous and boring. Experienced writers mix it up by using an assortment of sentence\npatterns, rhythms, and lengths.\nThis section discusses how to introduce sentence variety into writing, how to open sentences using a variety of techniques, and how\nto use different types of sentence structure when connecting ideas. You can use these techniques when revising a paper to bring life\nand rhythm to your work. They will also make reading your work more enjoyable.\nIncorporating Sentence Variety\nExperienced writers incorporate sentence variety into their writing by varying sentence style and structure. Using a mixture of\ndifferent sentence structures reduces repetition and adds emphasis to important points in the text. Read the following example:\nDuring my time in office I have achieved several goals. I have helped increase funding for local schools. I have reduced crime\nrates in the neighborhood. I have encouraged young people to get involved in their community. My competitor argues that she\nis the better choice in the upcoming election. I argue that it is ridiculous to fix something that isn\u2019t broken. If you reelect me\nthis year, I promise to continue to serve this community.\nIn this extract from an election campaign, the writer uses short, simple sentences of a similar length and style. Writers often\nmistakenly believe that this technique makes the text more clear for the reader, but the result is a choppy paragraph that does not\ngrab the audience\u2019s attention. Now read the revised paragraph with sentence variety:\nDuring my time in office, I have helped increase funding for local schools, reduced crime rates in the neighborhood, and\nencouraged young people to get involved in their community. Why fix what isn\u2019t broken? If you reelect me this year, I will\ncontinue to achieve great things for this community. Don\u2019t take a chance on an unknown contender; vote for the proven\nsuccess.\nNotice how introducing a short rhetorical question among the longer sentences in the paragraph is an effective means of keeping\nthe reader\u2019s attention. In the revised version, the writer combines the choppy sentences at the beginning into one longer sentence,\nwhich adds rhythm and interest to the paragraph.\nExercise 14.6.1\nCombine each set of simple sentences into one sentence using a connecting word (see the techniques in Fixing Run-Ons for\nexamples using a coordinating conjunction, a conjunctive adverb, or a dependent word).\n1.

Since the subject-verb-object\npattern is the simplest sentence structure, many writers tend to overuse this technique, which can result in repetitive paragraphs\nwith little sentence variety. This section examines several ways to introduce sentence variety at the beginning of sentences.\nStarting a Sentence with an Adverb\nOne technique you can use so as to avoid beginning a sentence with the subject is to use an adverb. An adverb is a word that\ndescribes a verb, adjective, or other adverb and often ends in \u2013ly. Examples of adverbs include quickly, softly, quietly, angrily, and\ntimidly. Read the following sentences:\nShe slowly turned the corner and peered into the murky basement.\nSlowly, she turned the corner and peered into the murky basement.\nIn the second sentence, the adverb slowly is placed at the beginning of the sentence. If you read the two sentences aloud, you will\nnotice that moving the adverb changes the rhythm of the sentence and slightly alters its meaning. The second sentence emphasizes\nhow the subject moves\u2014slowly\u2014creating a buildup of tension. This technique is effective in fictional writing.\nNote that an adverb used at the beginning of a sentence is usually followed by a comma. A comma indicates that the reader should\npause briefly, which creates a useful rhetorical device. Read the following sentences aloud and consider the effect of pausing after\nthe adverb:\nCautiously, he unlocked the kennel and waited for the dog\u2019s reaction.\nSolemnly, the policeman approached the mayor and placed her under arrest.\nSuddenly, they slammed the door shut and sprinted across the street.\nExercise 14.6.2\nRewrite the following sentences by moving the adverbs to the beginning.\n1. The red truck sped furiously past the camper van, blaring its horn.\n2. Jeff snatched at the bread hungrily, polishing off three slices in under a minute.\n3. Underage drinking typically results from peer pressure and lack of parental attention.\n4. The firefighters bravely tackled the blaze, but they were beaten back by flames.\n5. Mayor Johnson privately acknowledged that the budget was excessive and that further discussion was needed.\nStarting a Sentence with a Prepositional Phrase\nA prepositional phrase is a group of words that behaves as an adjective or an adverb, modifying a noun or a verb. Common\nprepositions include works like \"in,\" \"at,\" \"of,\" \"after,\" \"for,\" and \"below.\" Prepositional phrases contain a preposition (a word that\nspecifies place, direction, or time) and an object of the preposition (a noun phrase or pronoun that follows the preposition). See\nSection 13.16: Prepositions for more details.\nLet's take the following sentence as an example:\nThe terrified child hid underneath the table.\n14.6.2 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120593 Here, the prepositional phrase is underneath the table. The preposition underneath relates to the object that follows the preposition\n\u2014the table. Adjectives may be placed between the preposition and the object in a prepositional phrase.\nThe terrified child hid underneath the heavy wooden table.\nSome prepositional phrases can be moved to the beginning of a sentence in order to create variety in a piece of writing. Look at the\nfollowing revised sentence:\nUnderneath the heavy wooden table, the terrified child hid.\nNotice that when the prepositional phrase is moved to the beginning of the sentence, the emphasis shifts from the subject\u2014the\nterrified child\u2014to the location in which the child is hiding. Words that are placed at the beginning or end of a sentence generally\nreceive the greatest emphasis. Take a look at the following examples. The prepositional phrase is underlined in each:\nThe bandaged man waited in the doctor\u2019s office.\nIn the doctor\u2019s office, the bandaged man waited.\nMy train leaves the station at 6:45 a.m.\nAt 6:45 a.m., my train leaves the station.\nTeenagers exchange drugs and money under the railway bridge.\nUnder the railway bridge, teenagers exchange drugs and money.\nMake Sure the Prepositional Phrase Stays with What It Modifies\nNote that not all prepositional phrases can be placed at the beginning of a sentence. Read the following sentence:\nI would like a chocolate sundae without whipped cream.\nIn this sentence, without whipped cream is the prepositional phrase. Because it describes the chocolate sundae, it cannot be moved\nto the beginning of the sentence. \u201cWithout whipped cream I would like a chocolate sundae\u201d does not make as much (if any) sense.\nTo determine whether a prepositional phrase can be moved, we must determine the meaning of the sentence.\nUse Prepositional Phrases Judiciously\nExperienced writers often include more than one prepositional phrase in a sentence; however, it is important not to overload your\nwriting. Using too many modifiers in a paragraph may create an unintentionally comical effect as the following example shows:\nThe treasure lay buried under the old oak tree, behind the crumbling fifteenth-century wall, near the schoolyard, where children\nplayed merrily during their lunch hour, unaware of the riches that remained hidden beneath their feet.\nA sentence is not necessarily effective just because it is long and complex. If your sentence appears cluttered with prepositional\nphrases, divide it into two shorter sentences. The previous sentence is far more effective when written as two simpler sentences:\nThe treasure lay buried under the old oak tree, behind the crumbling fifteenth-century wall. In the nearby schoolyard, children\nplayed merrily during their lunch hour, unaware of the riches that remained hidden beneath their feet.\nStarting a Sentence by Inverting Subject and Verb\nAs we noted earlier, most writers follow the subject-verb-object sentence structure. In an inverted sentence, the order is reversed so\nthat the subject follows the verb. Read the following sentence pairs:\n1. A truck was parked in the driveway.\n2. Parked in the driveway was a truck.\n1. A copy of the file is attached.\n2. Attached is a copy of the file.\n14.6.3 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120593 Notice how the second sentence in each pair places more emphasis on the subject\u2014a truck in the first example and the file in the\nsecond. This technique is useful for drawing the reader\u2019s attention to your primary area of focus.\nExercise 14.6.3\nOn your own sheet of paper, rewrite the following sentences as inverted sentences.\n1. Teresa will never attempt to run another marathon.\n2. A detailed job description is enclosed with this letter.\n3. Bathroom facilities are across the hall to the left of the water cooler.\n4. The well-dressed stranger stumbled through the doorway.\n5. My colleagues remain unconvinced about the proposed merger.\nConnecting Ideas to Increase Sentence Variety\nReviewing and rewriting the beginning of sentences is a good way of introducing sentence variety into your writing. Another useful\ntechnique is to connect two sentences using a modifier, a relative clause, or an appositive. This section examines how to connect\nideas across several sentences in order to increase sentence variety and improve writing.\nJoining Ideas Using an \u2013ing Modifier\nSometimes it is possible to combine two sentences by converting one of them into a modifier using the \u2013ing verb form\u2014singing,\ndancing, swimming. A modifier is a word or phrase that qualifies the meaning of another element in the sentence. Read the\nfollowing example:\nOriginal sentences: Steve checked the computer system. He discovered a virus.\nRevised sentence: Checking the computer system, Steve discovered a virus.\nTo connect two sentences using an \u2013ing modifier, add \u2013ing to one of the verbs in the sentences (checking) and delete the subject\n(Steve). Use a comma to separate the modifier from the subject of the sentence. It is important to make sure that the main idea in\nyour revised sentence is contained in the main clause, not in the modifier. In this example, the main idea is that Steve discovered a\nvirus, not that he checked the computer system.\nIn the following example, an \u2013ing modifier indicates that two actions are occurring at the same time:\nNoticing the police car, she shifted gears and slowed down.\nThis means that she slowed down at the same time she noticed the police car.\nBarking loudly, the dog ran across the driveway.\nThis means that the dog barked as it ran across the driveway.\nYou can add an \u2013ing modifier to the beginning or the end of a sentence, depending on which fits best.\nBeginning: Conducting a survey among her friends, Amanda found that few were happy in their jobs.\nEnd: Maria filed the final report, meeting her deadline.\nJoining Ideas Using an \u2013ed Modifier\nSome sentences can be combined using an \u2013ed verb form\u2014stopped, finished, played. To use this method, one of the sentences must\ncontain a form of be as a helping verb in addition to the \u2013ed verb form. Take a look at the following example:\nOriginal sentences: The Jones family was delayed by a traffic jam. They arrived several hours after the party started.\nRevised sentence: Delayed by a traffic jam, the Jones family arrived several hours after the party started.\nIn the original version, was acts as a helping verb\u2014it has no meaning by itself, but it serves a grammatical function by placing the\nmain verb (delayed) in the perfect tense.\n14.6.4 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120593 To connect two sentences using an \u2013ed modifier, drop the helping verb (was) and the subject (the Jones family) from the sentence\nwith an \u2013ed verb form. This forms a modifying phrase (delayed by a traffic jam) that can be added to the beginning or end of the\nother sentence according to which fits best. As with the \u2013ing modifier, be careful to place the word that the phrase modifies\nimmediately after the phrase in order to avoid a dangling modifier.\nUsing \u2013ing or \u2013ed modifiers can help streamline your writing by drawing obvious connections between two sentences.\nJoining Ideas Using a Relative Clause\nAnother technique that writers use to combine sentences is to join them using a relative clause. A relative clause is a group of\nwords that contains a subject and a verb and describes a noun. Relative clauses function as adjectives by answering questions such\nas which one? or what kind? Relative clauses begin with a relative pronoun, such as who, which, where, why, or when. Read the\nfollowing examples:\nOriginal sentences: The managing director is visiting the company next week. He lives in Seattle.\nRevised sentence: The managing director, who lives in Seattle, is visiting the company next week.\nTo connect two sentences using a relative clause, substitute the subject of one of the sentences (he) for a relative pronoun (who).\nThis gives you a relative clause (who lives in Seattle) that can be placed next to the noun it describes (the managing director).\nMake sure to keep the sentence you want to emphasize as the main clause. For example, reversing the main clause and subordinate\nclause in the preceding sentence emphasizes where the managing director lives, not the fact that he is visiting the company.\nRevised sentence: The managing director, who is visiting the company next week, lives in Seattle.\nRelative clauses are a useful way of providing additional, nonessential information in a sentence.\nJoining Ideas Using an Appositive\nAn appositive is a word or group of words that describes or renames a noun or pronoun. Incorporating appositives into your writing\nis a useful way of combining sentences that are too short and choppy. Take a look at the following example:\nOriginal sentences: Harland Sanders began serving food for hungry travelers in 1930. He is Colonel Sanders or \u201cthe Colonel.\u201d\nRevised sentence: Harland Sanders, \u201cthe Colonel,\u201d began serving food for hungry travelers in 1930.\nIn the revised sentence, \u201cthe Colonel\u201d is an appositive because it renames Harland Sanders. To combine two sentences using an\nappositive, drop the subject and verb from the sentence that renames the noun and turn it into a phrase. Note that in the previous\nexample, the appositive is positioned immediately after the noun it describes. An appositive may be placed anywhere in a sentence,\nbut it must come directly before or after the noun to which it refers:\nAppositive after noun: Scott, a poorly trained athlete, was not expected to win the race.\nAppositive before noun: A poorly trained athlete, Scott was not expected to win the race.\nUnlike relative clauses, appositives are always punctuated by a comma or a set commas.\nExercise 14.6.4\nOn your own sheet of paper, rewrite the following sentence pairs as one sentence using the techniques you have learned in this\nsection.\n1. Baby sharks are called pups. Pups can be born in one of three ways.\n2. The Pacific Ocean is the world\u2019s largest ocean. It extends from the Arctic in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south.\n3. Michael Phelps won eight gold medals in the 2008 Olympics. He is a champion swimmer.\n4. Ashley introduced her colleague Dan to her husband, Jim. She speculated that the two of them would have a lot in\ncommon.\n5. Cacao is harvested by hand. It is then sold to chocolate-processing companies at the Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange.\n14.6.5 https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/@go\/page\/120593 "}
