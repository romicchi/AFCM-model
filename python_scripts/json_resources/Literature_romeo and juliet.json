{"text":"Act 1\nPROLOGUE\nCHORUS\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\nFrom ancient grudge, break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\n5 From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\nA pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,\nWhose misadventured piteous overthrows\u00b0 \u00b0destruction\nDoth with their death bury their parents\u2019 strife.\nThis fearful showing of their death-marked love,\n10 And the exhibition of their parents\u2019 rage\u2014\nWhich, but their children\u2019s end, naught could remove\u2014\nIs now the two hours\u2019 traffic of our stage\nThat which\u2013if you with patient ears attend\u2014\nHere goes unsaid, our toil shall strive to mend.\n\u2756\u2756\u2756\nACT 1, SCENE 1\nServants of the Capulet family start a fight with Montague family servants. Benvolio, a Montague, draws\nhis sword and attempts to break up the fight. Tybalt, a Capulet, sees the drawn sword of Benvolio. Tybalt\ndraws his sword and, after Benvolio tries to avoid conflict, Tybalt attacks. The fight escalates. Montague\nand Capulet enter the scene. The Prince enters and commands the fight to end. Frustrated with the family\nfeud, the Prince declares a death sentence on anybody who starts more trouble.\nIn the aftermath, Lady Montague asks Benvolio if he\u2019s seen Romeo, her son. Benvolio tells her that he saw\nRomeo earlier, but Romeo seemed troubled. Later, Benvolio approaches to ask Romeo about the mood\nhe\u2019s in. Romeo replies that he is in love with Rosaline, but saddened that she doesn\u2019t seem to love him\nback.\nOn a street somewhere in Verona:\nEnter two servingmen of the Capulets\n2 | Act 1 SAMPSON\n1\nGregory, on my word, we\u2019ll not carry coals.\nGREGORY\nNo, for then we should be colliers\u00b0. \u00b0coal miners\nSAMPSON\nI mean that if we be in choler\u00b0 we\u2019ll draw. \u00b0anger\nGREGORY\n2\nAye, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\nSAMPSON\n5 I strike quickly when moved.\nGREGORY\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\nSAMPSON\nA dog of the house of Montague would move me.\nGREGORY\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:\nTherefore if thou art moved, thou runn\u2019st away.\nSAMPSON\n10 A dog of that house shall move me to stand;\n3\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague\u2019s.\nGREGORY\n4\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest go to the wall.\n1. To not carry coals: to bear no insults\n2. Collar might refer to a hangman\u2019s noose.\n3. take the wall: There were no sidewalks at this time, so when passing one another on the street one person would \u201ctake the\nwall,\u201d forcing the other to walk in the gutter.\n4. slave: meant as an insult to someone\u2019s class. See also note to 1.5.55\nAct 1 | 3 SAMPSON\n\u2018Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever\n5\nthrust to the wall. Therefore, I will push Montague\u2019s men from\n15 the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.\nGREGORY\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\nSAMPSON\n\u2018Tis the same. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought\nwith the men, I will be civil with the maids, and cut off their\nheads.\nGREGORY\n20 The heads of the maids?\nSAMPSON\nAye, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads\u00b0; take it in \u00b0virginities\nwhat sense thou wilt.\nGREGORY\n6\nThose who feel it must take it in that sense.\nSAMPSON\nThey shall feel me while I\u2019m able to stand, and \u2018tis known I\u2019m a\n25 pretty piece of flesh.\nGREGORY\n\u2018Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-\n7\njohn. Draw thy tool! Here comes of the house of Montague.\nEnter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR, servingmen of the Montagues\n5. Sensitivity Footnote: Thrust...wall is a phrase alluding to sexual assault; in the context of this line, the speaker is saying\nbecause women are weak they are \"thrust to the wall.\" This is an example of victim blaming and misogyny.\n6. Sensitivity note: Take it is referring to rape in this context.\n7. poor-john: fish that was salted or dried because of its inferior quality\n4 | Act 1 SAMPSON\nMy naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back thee.\nGREGORY\nHow?

I will bite my thumb at them, which is\n35 disgrace to them if they bear it.\nABRAHAM\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\nSAMPSON\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\nABRAHAM\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\nSAMPSON\n[To GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say aye?\nAct 1 | 5 GREGORY\n40 No.\nSAMPSON\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.\nGREGORY\nDo you quarrel, sir?\nABRAHAM\nQuarrel, sir? No sir.\nSAMPSON\nIf you do, sir, I am yours to fight. I serve as good a man as you.\nABRAHAM\n45 No better than mine.\nSAMPSON\nWell, sir.\nEnter BENVOLIO\nGREGORY\nSay ours is better; here comes one of our master\u2019s kinsmen.\nSAMPSON\nYes: better, sir.\nABRAHAM\nYou lie.\nSAMPSON\n50 Draw, if you be men.

Were you here when it began?\nBENVOLIO\nHere were the servants of your adversary\n95 And yours, close fighting ere\u00b0 I did approach. \u00b0before\nI drew to part them; in the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about its head and cut the winds,\n100 Which, nothing hurt at all, hissed it in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\nCame more and more who fought on part and part,\nTil the prince came, who parted either part.\nLADY MONTAGUE\nO, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?\n105 Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\nBENVOLIO\nMadam, an hour before the worshipped sun\nPeered forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drove me to walk abroad\nWhere, underneath the grove of sycamore\n110 Which westward rooteth on this city-side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\nTowards him I made, but he was \u2018ware of me,\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\nI, presuming his affections as my own,\n115 Which then most sought where most might not be found,\nFeeling one too many with my weary self,\n12\nPursued my humor, not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunned who gladly flew from me.\nMONTAGUE\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\n120 With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.\n11. abroach: in action or agitation\n12. humor: fancy, whim; can also refer to mood\nAct 1 | 9 And all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nDoth in the farthest east begin to draw\n13\nThe shady curtains from Aurora\u2019s bed,\n125 Away from light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\nBlack and portentous\u00b0 will his humor prove \u00b0of a warning\n130 Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\nBENVOLIO\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\nMONTAGUE\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\nBENVOLIO\n14\nHave you importuned him by any means?\nMONTAGUE\nBoth by myself and many other friends.\n135 But he, his own affections counselor\nIs to himself\u2014I will not say how well\u2014\nKeeping himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nLike the flowerbud bit by an envious worm\n140 Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the same.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\nEnter ROMEO\nBENVOLIO\nSee where he comes.

This love that thou hast shown\nDost add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke raised from the fumes of sighs;\nWhen cleared, a fire sparkling in lovers\u2019 eyes;\nWhen vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.\n16\n185 What is it else?

Why no, but sadly tell me who.\nROMEO\n195 A sick man in sadness makes his will,\nIll are urging words to one already ill.\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\nBENVOLIO\nI aimed so near, when I supposed you loved.\nROMEO\nA right good marksman! And she\u2019s fair I love.\nBENVOLIO\n200 A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\nROMEO\nWell, in that hit you miss. She\u2019ll not be hit\nAct 1 | 13 17\nWith Cupid\u2019s arrow; she hath Diana\u2019s wit\nAnd, proving chastity strong and well-armed,\nFrom love\u2019s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.\n205 She will not stay the siege of loving words,\nNor bear th\u2019 encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope\u00b0 her lap to saint-seducing gold, \u00b0open\nO, she is rich in beauty; only poor,\nFor when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\nBENVOLIO\n210 Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\nROMEO\nShe hath, and in that sparing, makes huge waste.\nFor beauty, starved by chaste severity,\nCuts beauty off from all posterity\u00b0. \u00b0future children\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\n215 To merit bliss\u00b0 by causing me despair. \u00b0heaven\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow,\nDo I live dead that live to tell it now.\nBENVOLIO\nBe ruled by me: forget to think of her.\nROMEO\nO, teach me how I should forget to think!\nBENVOLIO\n220 By giving liberty unto thine eyes:\nExamine other beauties.\nROMEO\n\u2018Tis the way\nTo call hers exquisite, in question more.\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies\u2019 brows,\n225 Being black, puts to mind that they hide the fair.\nHe that is struck blind cannot forget\nThe previous treasure of his eyesight lost.\n17.

One of Capulet\u2019s servants invites them to a party Capulet is\nthrowing\u2014not knowing they are Montagues.

As they go Romeo claims, among\nother concerns, that he will not dance. Mercutio twists Romeo\u2019s melancholy comments into sexual jokes.\nRomeo, not interested in Mercutio\u2019s humor, says that a dream convinced him that attending the party is\na bad idea. Mercutio launches into a speech about Queen Mab, the fairy queen, who visits people in their\ndreams. Though the speech begins in a lighthearted manner, it takes a dark turn. Romeo snaps Mercutio\nout of his speech. Benvolio convinces them to get moving and get to the party.\nOn a street somewhere in Verona, near the Capulet estate:\nEnter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six other maskers, torch-bearers\nROMEO\nWhat speech shall be spoken to excuse us?\nOr shall we move on without apology?\nBENVOLIO\n36\nThe date is out of such prolixity.\nWe\u2019ll have no Cupid, tricked and blindfolded,\n37\n5 Bearing a Tartar\u2019s painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper\u00b0. \u00b0scarecrow\nBut let them measure us by what they will;\nWe\u2019ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\nROMEO\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling\u00b0. \u00b0dancing\n10 Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\nMERCUTIO\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\nROMEO\nNot I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\nWith nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\n36. The date is out of such prolixity: i.e., such boring excuses are unfashionable\n37. Tartar: ethnic group known for shooting arrows while moving on horseback. Bow of lath: cheap wood used for pretend\nbows. Benvolio is saying they won\u2019t have someone dressed up as Cupid introducing them to the party while holding this\nitem. Sensitivity note: Tartar is any member of several Turkic-speaking peoples that lived mainly in west-central Russia. But\nin this line, used as a way to describe Romeo's \"unacceptable\" appearance. This oppressive language exhibits harmful\nrepresentation.\nAct 1 | 25 That so stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\nMERCUTIO\n15 You are a lover: borrow Cupid\u2019s wings\n38\nAnd soar above a common bound.\nROMEO\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound\n39\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\n20 Under love\u2019s heavy burden do I sink.\nMERCUTIO\nAnd, to sink in it, so you burden love:\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\nROMEO\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.\nMERCUTIO\n25 If love be rough with you, be rough with love,\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\nGive me a case to put my visage\u00b0 in, \u00b0face; expression\nA visor\u00b0 for a visor. What care I \u00b0mask\n40\nIf a curious eye doth note deformities?\n41\n30 Here are the beetle-brows that shall blush for me.\nBENVOLIO\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in,\n42\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\n38. common bound: a normal jump, which was a popular dance move\n39. bound a pitch above dull woe: i.e., muster any feeling but woe\n40. Sensitivity note: deformities is used here to mean \"flaws.\" The diction displays ableism, and suggests that disabled folks need\n\"fixing.\"\n41. Beetle-brows: Mercutio\u2019s mask has beetle-brows (thick eyebrows)\n42. betake him to his legs: i.e., let\u2019s start dancing\n26 | Act 1 ROMEO\n43\nA torch for me. Let wantons light of heart\nTickle the senseless rushes\u00b0 with their heels, \u00b0the floor\n44\n35 For I am proverbed with a grandsier phrase.\nI\u2019ll be a candle-holder, and look on,\n45\nThe game was never so fair, and I am done.\nMERCUTIO\n46\nTut, dun\u2019s the mouse, the constable\u2019s own word,\nIf thou art done, we\u2019ll draw thee from the mire\u00b0 \u00b0your misery\n47\n40 Or\u2014save your reverence \u2014love, wherein thou stickest\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\nROMEO\nNay, that\u2019s not so.\nMERCUTIO\nI mean, sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, like lights by day;\n45 Take our good meaning\u00b0, for our judgment\u2019s fit \u00b0good intentions\nFive times in that, ere once in our fine wits.\nROMEO\nAnd we mean well in going to this masque\u00b0, \u00b0masquerade\nBut \u2018tis no wit to go.\nMERCUTIO\nWhy, may one ask?\nROMEO\n50 I dreamt a dream tonight.\n43. wantons light of heart: i.e., carefree partygoers\n44. For I am proverbed with a grandsier phrase: i.e., I know an old proverb that applies here\n45. The game was never so fair, and I am done: i.e., it\u2019s best to leave when the party is best\n46. Mercutio has interpreted \u201cdone\u201d as dun: a reference to the game \u201cDun the horse is in the mire,\u201d in which players would try to\nlift a large log from the mire (mud). He refers to the phrase \u201cdun\u2019s the mouse\u201d (meaning \u201cquiet as a mouse\u201d), saying this is an\nappropriate saying for a useless policeman. Basically, he mocks Romeo for being mouselike and a stick-in-the-mud.\n47. save your reverence: a phrase used to replace a rude word\nAct 1 | 27 MERCUTIO\nAnd so did I.\nROMEO\nWell, what was yours?\nMERCUTIO\nThat dreamers often lie.\nROMEO\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\nMERCUTIO\n55 O, then I see Queen Mab has been with you.\nShe is the Fairies\u2019 midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone,\nOn the forefinger of an alderman\u00b0, \u00b0councilman\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\u00b0 \u00b0miniscule creatures\n60 Over men\u2019s noses as they lie asleep.\nHer wagon spokes made of long spinners\u2019 legs\u00b0, \u00b0spider legs\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers,\nHer traces\u00b0 of the smallest spider web, \u00b0reins\nHer collars\u00b0 of the moonshine\u2019s watery beams, \u00b0part of a harness\n65 Her whip of cricket\u2019s bone, the lash of philome\u00b0, \u00b0film; fine thread\nHer waggoner, a small gray-coated gnat\nNot half so big as a round little worm\n48\nPricked from the lazy finger of a maid.\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\n70 Made by the joiner\u00b0 squirrel or old grub, \u00b0carpenter\n49\nTime out o\u2019 mind the fairies\u2019 coach-makers.\nIn this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers\u2019 brains, and then they dream of love;\n50\nOn courtiers\u2019 knees, that dream on curtsies straight,\n75 O\u2019er ladies\u2019 lips, who strait on kisses dream\u2014which\nOft the angry Mab with blisters plagues\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats\u00b0 tainted are. \u00b0candy\nSometime she gallops o\u2019er a lawyer\u2019s nose,\nThen dreams he of smelling out a suit.\n48. Sensitivity note: lazy finger of a maid is inherently sexist and undermining to the hardworking women of the time period.\n49. Time out o\u2019 mind: for as long as anyone can remember\n50. dream on curties straight: immediately dream about curtsies\n28 | Act 1 51\n80 And sometime comes she with a tithe-pigs tail,\nTickling a person\u2019s nose that lies asleep,\n52\nThen he dreams of another benefice.\nSometimes she drives over a soldier\u2019s neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\n85 Of breaches, ambuscados\u00b0, Spanish blades, \u00b0ambushes\n53\nOf healths five-fathom deep, and then anon\nDrums in his ears, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\n90 That plaits the manes of horses in the night\nAnd bakes the elklocks in foul sluttish hairs\n54\nWhich, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\n95 Making them women of good carriage.\n55\nThis is she\u2014\nROMEO\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\nThou talkst of nothing.\nMERCUTIO\nTrue, I talk of dreams\n100 Which are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who woos\nEven now the frozen bosom\u00b0 of the North; \u00b0breast\n105 And, being angered, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his tide to the dew-dropping South.\n51. tithe-pig: to pay a tax to their church, people would often choose to pay one pig out of ten\n52. benefice: i.e., giving tax to a church\n53. healths five-fathoms deep: The soldier would dream of toasts (\u201chealths\u201d) that go on and on; basically, cups of alcohol that\nnever run dry.\n54. This is that very Mab\u2026which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes: Mab secretely tangles horses\u2019 manes at night, which\nbring bad luck when untangled.\n55. Sensitivity note: Mercutio's description of Mab plays into the concept of \"woman as myth,\" where men describe women as\nbeings with bad intentions, such as the witch\/the seductress\/the Medusa. This mythological aura of women is a direct\nacknowledgement that men do not understand women, and instead of trying to recognize their ignorance they instead\nportray women as unknowable.\nAct 1 | 29 BENVOLIO\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\nROMEO\nI fear too early, for my mind misgives\n110 Some consequence yet hanging in the stars\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night\u2019s revels, and expire the term\nOf the despised life closed in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\n115 But he that hath the steerage of my course,\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\nBENVOLIO\nStrike, drum!\nExit all\n\u2756\u2756\u2756\nACT 1, SCENE 5\nThe party begins. Capulet greets guests, encouraging them to dance and have a good time. Romeo sees\nJuliet. For him, it\u2019s love at first sight. Tybalt recognizes Romeo as a Montague, and wants to fight. Capulet\nhears this and rebukes Tybalt. Capulet wants no disturbances at the party, and explains that Romeo is a\nrespected youth in the community.\nRomeo approaches Juliet, touching her hand. They flirt back and forth and eventually kiss. The Nurse\nfinds Juliet and beckons her away. Romeo asks the Nurse who Juliet is. The Nurse tells him she\u2019s Capulet\u2019s\ndaughter. Juliet is intrigued by Romeo, and convinces the Nurse to find out who he is. The Nurse finds out,\nand tells Juliet that Romeo is a Montague. Romeo and Juliet are each crushed to find out the identity of\nthe other. They both feel powerful longing for one another despite their family conflict.\nInside the Capulet estate:\nEnter SERVINGMEN with napkins\nPETER\nWhere\u2019s Potpan, that he does not help us clear away? He took a plate? He eats from it?\n30 | Act 1 FIRST SERVINGMAN\nWhen good manners are found in just one or two men\u2019s hands,\nand they unwashed too, \u2018tis a foul thing.\nSECOND SERVINGMAN\n5 Take away the joint stools, remove the sideboards, and the plates\n56\ntoo, good thou, save me a piece of marzipan, and if thou loves\n57\nme, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.\nEnter ANTHONIE and POTPAN\nAnthonie and Potpan!\nANTHONIE\nAye, boy, ready.\nPETER\n10 You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for in the\ngreat chamber.\nPOTPAN\nWe cannot be here and there too.

She that makes dainty,\nShe I\u2019ll swear hath corns. Am I come near to truth?\nWelcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\nWhen I could wear a mask and tell\n20 A whispering tale in a fair lady\u2019s ear\n56. marzipan: confection of crushed almonds or almond paste, sugar, and egg whites\n57. Susan Grindstone and Nell: his friends\n58. makes dainty: coyly refuses\nAct 1 | 31 Such as would please. \u2018Tis gone, \u2018tis gone, \u2018tis gone.\nYou are welcome, gentlemen!\u2014Come, musicians, play!\nMusic plays, they dance\nThe hall, the hall, make room! And foot it, girls.\n[To SERVANTS] More light, you knaves\u00b0. And turn the tables up. \u00b0fools\n25 And quench the fire. The room has grown too hot.\nAh sirrah, this unlooked-for sport feels well.\n[To COUSIN] Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,\nFor you and I are past our dancing days.\nHow long is \u2018t now since last yourself and I\n30 Were in a mask?\nCOUSIN CAPULET\n59\nBy\u2019r Lady, about thirty years.\nCAPULET\nWhat man, \u2018tis not so much, \u2018tis not so much.\n\u2018Tis since the nuptial\u00b0 of Lucentio, \u00b0wedding\nCome the years as quickly as they will,\n35 Some five and twenty years than last we masked.\nCOUSIN CAPULET\n\u2018Tis more, \u2018tis more, his son is older, sir.\nHis son is thirty.\nCAPULET\nWill you tell me that?\nHis son was but a ward\u00b0 two years ago. \u00b0a child\nROMEO\n40 What lady is that which does enrich the hand of yonder Knight?\nSERVINGMAN\nI know not, sir.\n59. By\u2019r Lady: an exclamation derived from the phrase \u201cby our Lady\u201d\n32 | Act 1 ROMEO\nOh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright,\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\n45 Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop\u2019s\u00b0 ear, \u00b0Ethiopian\u2019s\n60\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.\nSo shows like a snowy dove trooping with crows,\nThat yonder lady o\u2019er her fellows shows.\nWhen dancing done, I\u2019ll find her place of stand,\n50 And touching hers, make bless\u00e8d my rude hand.\nIf my heart loved till now, forswear\u00b0 it sight, \u00b0swear off\nFor I never saw true beauty till this night.\nTYBALT\nThis by that voice, should be a Montague.\n61\nFetch me my rapier, boy.\nHis PAGE exits\n62\n55 How dares the slave\nCome hither covered with a masked face,\nTo laugh and scorn at our ceremony?\nNow, by the stock\u00b0 and honor of my kin, \u00b0breeding; pedigree\nI\u2019ll strike him dead, and hold it not a sin.\nCAPULET\n60 Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\nTYBALT\nUncle, this is a Montague, our foe.\nA villain that is hither come in spite,\nTo scorn at our ceremony this night.\nCAPULET\nYoung Romeo, is it?\n60. Sensitivity note: Ethiope is a shortening of \"Ethiopian,\" which in the period written implies a Black person. The word evokes\ncontrast: according to this language, rich jewelry stands out on a Black person's skin, as the moon against the night. This is\nan example of how language is used in an oppressive way without an overt statement of racism.\n61. rapier: a thin, sharp sword\n62. Sensitivity note: the word slave was probably meant as an insult to his class or as a way to say rascal. America, specifically the\nUnited States, has a very radicalized history of slavery; when this play was first performed, modern ideas of race were starting\nto develop and England was at the start of a long period of colonization and engagement in the Atlantic slave trade.\nAct 1 | 33 TYBALT\n65 \u2018Tis he, that villain Romeo.\nCAPULET\nContent thee, gentle cousin. Let him alone.\nHe bears himself like a real gentleman.\nAnd, to say truth, Verona brags of him\nTo be a virtuous and well-governed youth.\n70 I would not, for the wealth of all this town,\nHere in my house do him disparagement.\nTherefore be patient, take no note of him.\nIt is my will, so if this thou respect,\nShow a fair presence, and give up those frowns\n75 Which are ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\nTYBALT\nIt fits, when such a villain is a guest.\nI\u2019ll not endure him.\nCAPULET\nHe shall be endured.\n63\nWhat, lordful boy! I say he shall. Go to.\n80 Am I the master here or you? Go to.\nYou\u2019ll not endure him. God shall mend my soul!\nYou\u2019ll make a mutiny among my guests:\nYou will set chaos here. You\u2019ll be the cause!\nTYBALT\nBut Uncle, he shames us.\nCAPULET\n85 Go to, go to.\nYou are a saucy boy. Is\u2019t so, indeed?\nThis trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.\nMust you contradict me? Marry, \u2018tis time\u2013\n[To GUESTS] Well said, my hearts \u2014 [To TYBALT] You are a young fool.

Tybalt is being chastised for his presumptive attitude.\n34 | Act 1 TYBALT\nPatience forced, with willful choler meeting,\nMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\nI will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,\n95 Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall.\nExit TYBALT\nROMEO\nIf I profane with my unworthiest hand\nThis holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, readily stand,\nTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\nJULIET\n100 Good Pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much.\nSuch mannerly devotion shows in this,\nFor saints have hands, that pilgrims\u2019 hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers\u2019 kiss.\nROMEO\nHave not saints lips? And holy palmers too?\nJULIET\n105 Aye, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.\nROMEO\nO then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,\nAnd pray. Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair?\nJULIET\nSaints do not move; they grant for prayers\u2019 sake.\nROMEO\nThen move not while my prayer\u2019s effect I take.\n110 Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.\nThey kiss\nAct 1 | 35 JULIET\nNow have my lips the sin that they have took.\nROMEO\nSin from my lips?

Romeo!\nAct 2 | 39 MERCUTIO\nHe is wise, and on my life he hath stolen home to bed.\nBENVOLIO\n5 He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.\nCall, good Mercutio.\nMERCUTIO\nNay, I\u2019ll conjure\u00b0 too. \u00b0summon (as in a spirit)\nRomeo, Humors, Madman, Passion, Lover,\nAppear thou in the likeness of a sigh,\nSpeak but one rhyme, and I\u2019ll be satisfied:\n10 Cry out at me, \u201cAye me,\u201d pronounce but \u201clove\u201d and \u201cdove.\u201d\nSpeak to my gossip\u00b0 Venus one fair word, \u00b0good friend\n1\nOne nickname for her pureblind\u00b0 son and heir, \u00b0blind\nYoung Abraham: Cupid\u2013he that shot so true,\n2\nWhen King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.\n15 He hears me not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.\nThe ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\nI conjure thee by Rosaline\u2019s bright eyes,\n3\nBy her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,\nBy her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,\n4\n20 And the domains that there adjacent lie,\nThat in thy likeness, thou appear to us.\nBENVOLIO\nAnd if he hears you, that will anger him.\nMERCUTIO\nThis cannot anger him. It would anger him\nTo raise a spirit in his mistress\u2019s circle,\n25 Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\nTill she had laid it, and conjured it down.\n1. Sensitivity note: Cupid is the Greek god of love, often portrayed as a young winged boy wearing a blindfold and carrying a\nbow and arrow. This is meant to symbolize the randomness of love and attraction, and is where we find the phrase \"Love is\nblind\".\n2. King Cophetua: An African king who had no interest in women until he fell in love with a beggar woman outside his palace.\n3. high forehead: a sign of female beauty\n4. Sensitivity note: In referring to and openly discussing Rosaline's body, Mercutio is being purposefully crude in order to draw\nout Romeo. This type of bawdy humor was a mark of Shakespeare's comedy, and was often done at the expense of the\nfemale characters.\n40 | Act 2 That were some spite. My invocation\u00b0 \u00b0appeal\nIs fair and honest, and, his mistress\u2019s name,\nI conjure only but to raise him up.\nBENVOLIO\n30 Come, he hath hidden himself among these trees\nTo be comforted by the humorous\u00b0 night. \u00b0humid\nBlind is his love, which best befits the dark.\nMERCUTIO\nIf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\n5\nNow he will sit under a medlar tree,\n35 And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit,\nAs maids call medlars when they laugh alone.\nO Romeo, that she were\u2013O that she were\n6\nAn open arse, and thou a \u201cpoperin\u201d pear.\nRomeo, goodnight, I\u2019ll go to my trundle bed,\n40 This field bed is too cold for me to sleep.\nCome, shall we go?\nBENVOLIO\nGo then, for it is in vain\nTo seek him here that means not to be found.\nExit BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO\nROMEO\nHe laughs at scars that never felt a wound.\n\u2756\u2756\u2756\nACT 2, SCENE 2\nJuliet appears in a window above Romeo, and she thinks she\u2019s alone. She talks to herself, lamenting\nRomeo\u2019s nature as a Montague. She wishes he would abandon his name, or that she could abandon hers,\nso that they could be together. Upon hearing this, Romeo reveals himself and professes his love to Juliet.\nJuliet shares the feelings of love, but worries that Romeo\u2019s feelings might be fleeting. The Nurse calls for\n5.

Cast it off.\nIt is my lady, O it is my love, O that she knew she were.\n10 She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses\u00b0; I will answer it. \u00b0communicates\n\u2026I am too bold. \u2018Tis not to me she speaks:\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the Heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\n15 To twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there and they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\nAs daylight does a lamp; her eye in Heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\n20 That birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand?\nO, that I were a glove upon that hand\nThat I might touch that cheek!\nJULIET\nAye, me.\nROMEO\n25 She speaks!\nO, speak again, bright Angel!

It is nor hand nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man.\nWhat\u2019s in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet.\n45 So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\nRetain that divine perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff\u00b0 thy name, \u00b0remove; cast away\nAnd for thy name which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\nROMEO\n50 I take thee at thy word,\nCall me but love, and I\u2019ll be new baptized.\nHenceforth, I never will be Romeo.\nJULIET\nWhat man art thou, that thus bescreened\u00b0 by night, \u00b0concealed\nSo stumbles on my counsel\u00b0? \u00b0private thoughts\nROMEO\n55 By a name, I know not how to tell thee who I am.\nMy name, dear Saint, is hateful to myself\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\nAct 2 | 43 JULIET\nMy ears have not yet drunk a hundred words\n60 Of thy tongue\u2019s uttering, yet I know the sound.\nArt thou not Romeo and a Montague?\nROMEO\nNeither, fair Saint, if either thee dislike.\nJULIET\nHow camest thou hither?\nTell me, and wherefore?\n65 The orchard walls are high and hard to climb\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\nROMEO\nWith love\u2019s light wings did I o\u2019erperch\u00b0 these walls, \u00b0fly over\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\n70 And what love can do, that dares love attempt,\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.\nJULIET\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\nROMEO\nAlas, there lies more peril in thine eyes\nThan twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,\n75 And I am proof\u00b0 against their enmity\u00b0. \u00b0immune \u00b0hostility\nJULIET\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\nROMEO\nI have night\u2019s cloak to hide me from their eyes,\nAnd, but thou love me, let them find me here.\nMy life were better ended by their hate\n80 Than death prolonged, wanted of thy love.\n44 | Act 2 JULIET\nBy whose direction found\u2019st thou out this place?\nROMEO\nBy love, that first did prompt me to inquire.\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, were thou as far\n85 As the vast shore washeth with the farthest sea,\nI should adventure for such merchandise.\nJULIET\nThou knowest the mask of night on my face,\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\n90 Fain\u00b0 would I dwell on form\u00b0.

I know thou wilst say \u201cAye,\u201d\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear\u2019st,\nThou might prove false. At lovers\u2019 perjuries\n8\n95 They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr if thou think I am too quickly won,\nI\u2019ll frown and be perverse\u00b0, and say thee nay \u00b0destruction\nSo thou wilt woo; but else not for the world.\n100 In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond:\nAnd therefore thou might think my behavior light\u00b0. \u00b0immodest\nBut trust me, gentleman, I\u2019ll prove more true\nThan those who have more cunning to be strange\u00b0. \u00b0standoffish\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\n105 But that thou overheard, ere I was \u2018ware,\nMy true love\u2019s passion. Therefore, pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\nROMEO\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\n110 That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops\u2014\nJULIET\nO swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\n8.

Romeo\nfinds the friar. The friar notices that Romeo hasn\u2019t slept, and asks if Romeo slept with Rosaline in sin.\nRomeo denies it and describes his new love of Juliet. The friar is concerned at how quickly Romeo\u2019s feelings\nhave changed. Romeo convinces the friar to perform a wedding for Romeo and Juliet. The friar hopes that\nsome good may come of it, perhaps even an end to the feud between the Capulets and Montagues.\nFriar Lawrence\u2019s cell in Verona; early morning:\nEnter FRIAR alone with a basket\nFRIAR\nThe grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,\nCheckering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\nAnd fleck\u00e8d darkness like a drunkard reels\n11\nFrom forth day\u2019s path and Titan\u2019s fiery wheels.\n5 Now ere the sun advance his burning eye,\nThe day to cheer, and night\u2019s dank dew to dry,\nI must fill up this reed basket of ours\nWith deadly weeds, and precious juiced flowers.\nThe earth, that\u2019s nature\u2019s mother, is her tomb,\n10 And is her burying grave, and is her womb.\nAnd from her womb children of diverse kind\n11.

Benvolio found out from a Montague servant that\nRomeo never returned home the night before. Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has challenged Romeo\nto a duel. Mercutio describes why he hates Tybalt. When Romeo arrives, Mercutio mocks Romeo for being\nweak because of his love for Rosaline. Romeo neglects to tell them about Juliet. The Nurse enters with a\nCapulet servant, Peter. Romeo tells her to pass on a message: have Juliet meet him for confessional at Friar\nLawrence\u2019s cell that afternoon, where Friar Lawrence will marry them. The Nurse agrees.\nSomewhere in Verona; morning:\nEnter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO\nMERCUTIO\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?\nBENVOLIO\nNot to his father\u2019s.

And is\nhe a man to encounter Tybalt?\nBENVOLIO\n15 Why, what is Tybalt?\nMERCUTIO\n19\nMore than the Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\u2019s the\ncourageous Captain of Compliments.

What counterfeit\nDid I give you?\n23. the immortal\u2026the hay: Italian fencing terms\n24. pox: exclamation of irritation\n25. antic: possibly grotesque or \u201cantique,\u201d though due to the era\u2019s spelling and the context \u201cantic\u201d is likely\n26. their bones: pun on French \u201cbon\u201d\n27. roe: fish eggs, or the \u201cro\u201d in Romeo\n28. dowdy: unattractively dressed woman\n29.

Follow me this jest now, till thou has worn out thy\n55 pump, that when the single role of it is worn, the jest may remain,\nafter the wearing, solely singular.\nROMEO\n32\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness.\nMERCUTIO\nCome between us, good Benvolio. My wits fail.\nROMEO\n33\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs, or I\u2019ll win this match.\nMERCUTIO\n60 Nay, if our wits run the wild goose chase, I am done: for thou\nhast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I\nhave in my whole five.

Now art thou\nsociable; now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art\n75 as well as by nature: for this riveling love is like a great natural\u00b0, \u00b0idiot\nthat runs lolling\u00b0 up and down to hide his bauble\u00b0 in a hole. \u00b0loose \u00b0jester\u2019s baton\nBENVOLIO\nStop there, stop there.\nMERCUTIO\n34\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\nBENVOLIO\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\nMERCUTIO\n80 O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: For I was come\nto the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the\nargument no longer.\nEnter NURSE and her man, PETER\nROMEO\nHere comes goodly stuff.

Pray you, sir, a word. And as I told you, my young\nlady bid me inquire you out; what she bid me say, I will keep to\nmyself, but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool\u2019s\nparadise, as they say, it would be very gross kind of behavior, as\nthey say. For the gentlewoman is young, and therefore, if you\n140 should deal double\u00b0 with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered \u00b0double cross\nto any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing\u00b0. \u00b0poor behavior\nROMEO\n46\nNurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress, I protest unto\nthee\u2014\nNURSE\nGood heart, and in faith, I will tell her as much.

When the Nurse returns, Juliet begs her for information. The Nurse\ndelays, saying she\u2019s too tired and her body is too sore. Juliet pressures her until the Nurse gives in and tells\nher that Romeo is waiting to marry her at Friar Lawrence\u2019s cell.\nSomewhere outside the Capulet estate:\nEnter JULIET\nJULIET\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That\u2019s not so:\n55\nO, she is lame!

Send thy man away.\nNURSE\n20 Peter, stay at the gate.\nExit PETER\n55. Sensitivity note: \"Lame,\" as used here, means feeble or slow. Though \"lame\" is primarily used to describe someone who is\ndisabled in their leg or foot, it has evolved to mean \"uninspiring\" or \"slow.\" It is important to be conscious of using words\nrelated to disability in a derogatory manner, as it can contribute to a negative connotation surrounding words that are still\nprimarily used to objectively describe differently-abled individuals.\n56. nimble-pinioned doves draw Love: as doves pull Venus in her chariot\n57.

Can you not wait awhile?\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\nJULIET\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me, that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay,\n35 Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\n59\nSay either, and I\u2019ll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied, is\u2019t good or bad?\nNURSE\nWell, you have made a foolish choice. You know not how to\n40 choose a man. Romeo, no, not he, though his face be better than\nany man\u2019s; and his leg excels all mens\u2019; and for a hand, and a foot,\nand a body, though not much to talk on, yet they are past\n60\ncompare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but I\u2019ll warrant him as\ngentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God. What, have you\n45 dined at home?\n58.

The Nurse is enduring pain so that Juliet may find happiness. However, she suggests that Juliet will soon be the one\nenduring pain for the pleasure of another when she consummates her marriage with Romeo. The implication is that it will\nbe Juliet's burden as a wife to please her husband. This fits the comedic albeit insensitive tone typical of the Nurse.\nAct 2 | 69 ROMEO\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrows will,\nThey cannot countervail\u00b0 the exchange of joy \u00b0equal\n5 That one short minute gives me of her sight.\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\nFRIAR\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\n10 And in their triumph die like fire and powder\u00b0. \u00b0gun powder\nWhich, as they kiss, consume.

Tybalt and other Capulets arrive, whom Mercutio taunts. Benvolio tries to move the conflict\nsomewhere private, but Romeo interrupts with his arrival. Tybalt challenges him to fight, citing prior\ngrievances; Romeo refuses and attempts to de-escalate the situation. Mercutio goads Tybalt into a duel,\nwhich Romeo tries and fails to stop. Tybalt stabs Mercutio, who in his dying moments curses both the\nMontague and Capulet houses. Benvolio informs Romeo that Mercutio is dead; upon re-encountering\nTybalt, Romeo fights and kills him. Benvolio convinces Romeo to flee before passersby arrive. The Prince\nand both families then arrive to the scene. Benvolio explains what happened, but Lady Capulet, observing\nBenvolio to be biased, urges the Prince to punish the Montague family by executing Romeo. The Prince\nchooses instead to banish Romeo from the city.\nOn a street somewhere in Verona:\nEnter MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO\nBENVOLIO\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let\u2019s retire,\nThe day is hot, the Capulets are abroad,\nAnd if we meet we shall not \u2018scape a brawl,\nFor these hot days is the mad blood stirring.\nMERCUTIO\n5 Thou art like one of these fellows who, when he enters the\nconfines of a tavern, claps down his sword upon the table and\nsays \u201cGod send me no need of thee,\u201d but under the influence\nof the second cup, draws it on the drawer\u00b0, when indeed there is no \u00b0bartender\nneed.\nBENVOLIO\n10 Am I like such a fellow?\nMERCUTIO\nCome, come, thou art such a Jack in thy moods as any in Italy,\nand as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be\nmoved.\n72 | Act 3 BENVOLIO\n1\nAnd what to?\nMERCUTIO\n15 Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for\none would kill the other. Thou\u2014why, thou wilt quarrel with a\nman who hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou\nhast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts\u00b0, having no \u00b0hazelnuts\nother reason than that thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such\n20 an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of\nquarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head has been\nbeaten as addled\u00b0 as an egg from quarrelling. Thou once \u00b0beaten\nquarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath\nwakened thy dog that had lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not\n25 fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet\u00b0 before Easter? \u00b0jacket\nWith another for tying his new shoes with old ribbons? And\n2\nthou wilt tutor me from quarrelling?\nBENVOLIO\nAn I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the\nfee-simple\u00b0 of my life for an hour and a quarter. \u00b0ownership\nMERCUTIO\n30 The fee-simple? O, simple!\nEnter TYBALT and his company\nBENVOLIO\nBy my head, here come the Capulets.\nMERCUTIO\nBy my heel, I care not.\nTYBALT\n[To his company] Follow me close, for I will speak to them.\nGentlemen, good den\u00b0.

Juliet pretends to hate Romeo while telling the audience that\nshe forgives him completely. Lady Capulet tells Juliet that she is set to be married to Paris next Thursday.\nJuliet protests that it is far too soon. Her father enters, just as surprised as his wife that Juliet is still grieving.\nHe expects Juliet to be pleased at the news of the marriage; when she begs him to change their plans,\nhe flies into a rage, silencing the Nurse who jumps to Juliet\u2019s defense. He threatens to disown Juliet if she\nrefuses to marry and then leaves. Juliet asks her mother for help; she refuses and also exits. Juliet then goes\nto the Nurse for comfort, who tells her that she should marry Paris and be happy since Romeo is as good\nas dead in exile.

Look, love: what envious streaks\nDo lace the severing\u00b0 clouds in yonder east; \u00b0parting\nNight\u2019s candles are burnt out, and jocund\u00b0 day \u00b0cheerful\n10 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\nJULIET\nYond light is not daylight\u2014I know it.

Hastes our marriage: To move quickly with the wedding\n108 | Act 4 3\nMay be put from her by society.\n15 Now you do know the reason of this haste.\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\n4\n[To himself] I would I knew not why it should be slowed.\n[To PARIS] Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.\nEnter Juliet\nPARIS\nHappily met, my lady and my wife.\nJULIET\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\nPARIS\n20 That \u201cmay be\u201d must be, love, on Thursday next.\nJULIET\nWhat must be shall be.\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThat\u2019s a certain text\u00b0. \u00b0truth\nPARIS\n5\nCome you to make confession to this father?\nJULIET\nTo answer that, I would confess to you.\n3. May be put from her by society: Paris is saying that with company, she might cry less\n4. I would I knew not what it should be slowed: Friar Lawrence wants to be heard by the audience, not Paris, and is saying that\nhe wishes he didn't know what was to come.\n5. Come you to make confession to this father?: Paris is asking Juliet if she has come to confess to the Friar. Confession is a\ncommon practice in the Catholic religion.\nAct 4 | 109 PARIS\n25 Do not deny to him that you love me.\nJULIET\n6\nI will confess to you that I love him.\nPARIS\nSo will ye \u2013 I am sure that you love me.\nJULIET\nIf I do so, it will be of more worth\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\nPARIS\n30 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.\nJULIET\nThe tears have got small\u00b0 victory by that, \u00b0not much\n7\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\nPARIS\nThou wrong\u2019st it more than tears, with that report.\nJULIET\nThat is no slander, sir, when it\u2019s a truth,\n35 And what I said, I said it to my face.\nPARIS\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.\n6. I will confess to you that I love him: Juliet is using tricky and playful language to confuse Paris and keep him under the\nimpression that she does love him. In fact, she is actually saying that she will confess that she loves Romeo.\n7. For it was bad enough before their spite: Her face was abused and dirty enough before the tears. She is trying to get Paris to\nleave her alone.\n110 | Act 4 JULIET\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own. \u2014\nAre you at leisure, Holy Father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening Mass?\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\n40 My leisure serves me, somber daughter, now.\nMy lord, we must ask for this time alone.\nPARIS\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.\nHe kisses her\nExit Paris\nJULIET\n45 O, shut the door!

Shall be the label to another deed: That Juliet should be married to both Romeo and Paris.\nAct 4 | 111 Therefore out of thy long-experienced time,\nGive me some present counsel, or, behold,\n\u2018Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the umpire, arbitrating that,\n9\n65 Which the commission of thy years and art\nCould not to this issue true honor bring.\nBe not so long to speak; I long to die\nIf what thou speak\u2019st speak not of remedy.\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHold, daughter! I do spy a kind of hope\n70 Which craves as desperate an execution\n10\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf rather than to marry County Paris\nThou hast the strength or will to slay thyself,\nThen it is likely thou wilt undertake\n75 A thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat copes with Death himself to \u2018scape from it;\nAnd, if thou darest, I\u2019ll give thee remedy.\nJULIET\nO bid me leap \u2013 rather than marry Paris \u2013\nFrom off the battlements of any tower,\n80 Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears\n11\nOr hide me nightly in a charnel house,\nO\u2019ercovered quite\u00b0 with dead men\u2019s rattling bones, \u00b0entirely\n12\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\n85 Or bid me go into a new-made grave\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his tomb;\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt\nTo keep myself a faithful unstained wife\n90 To my dear lord, my dearest Romeo.\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHold then: go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.\n9. the commission of thy years and art: the authority of your age and skills\n10. Which craves as...which we would prevent: the friar is saying that his plan is as difficult as their current situation, but that it\ncould work.\n11. charnel house: structure that stores burial remains\n12. reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls: smelly bones and jawless skulls\n112 | Act 4 Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\nAnd when thou art alone, take thou this vial,\n95 And this distilling liquor drink thou off,\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse\nShall keep his native rhythm but surcease\u00b0. \u00b0cease\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest;\n100 The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo many ashes.

Repentant, she asks for forgiveness and\nagrees to marry Paris. Lord Capulet, in his excitement, decides to advance the ceremony from Thursday\nto Wednesday (tomorrow). Ignoring his wife\u2019s protests, he instructs her to be with Juliet while he finishes\npreparations and sends word to Paris of the changed itinerary.\nSomewhere within the Capulet estate:\nEnter Capulet, Lady capulet, Nurse, and Servingmen\nCAPULET\nSo many guests invite as here are writ.\nGives a list to a SERVANT, who then exits.\nSirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.\nSERVINGMAN\n15\nYou shall have none ill\u00b0, sir, for I\u2019ll test if they will lick their fingers. \u00b0unskilled\nCAPULET\nHow canst thou test them so?\nSERVINGMAN\n5 Marry sir, \u2018tis an ill cook that will not lick his own fingers:\nTherefore he that will not lick his fingers goes not with me.\nCAPULET\nGo, be gone.\n15. lick their fingers: The servingman speaks with a dialect of the lower class. Licking their fingers is a sign that a cook likes their\nown cooking, so they must be a good hire.\n114 | Act 4 Exit Servingman\nWe shall be much unfurnished\u00b0 for this time. \u00b0unprepared\nWhat, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?\nNURSE\n10 Aye, forsooth.\nCAPULET\nWell he may chance to do some good on her.\nA peevish, self-willed harlotry\u00b0 it is. \u00b0unprincipled behavior\nEnter Juliet\nLADY CAPULET\nSee, here she commeth from confession.\nCAPULET\nHow now, my headstrong?\n15 Where have you been gadding\u00b0? \u00b0wandering\nJULIET\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin\nOf disobedient opposition\nTo you and your behests, and am enjoined\u00b0 \u00b0compelled\nBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here [Juliet kneels]\n20 To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!\nHenceforward I am ever ruled by you.\nCAPULET\nNow before God, this holy reverend Friar,\nAll our whole city is much bound\u00b0 to him! \u00b0indebted\nSend for the County. Go tell him of this.\n16\n25 I\u2019ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.\nJULIET\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence\u2019s cell,\n16. this knot knit up tomorrow morning: this means Juliet will be married in the morning, a day earlier than planned.\nAct 4 | 115 And gave him what becomed love I might,\nNot stepping o\u2019er the bounds of modesty.\nCAPULET\nWhy, I am glad on\u2019t. This is well. Stand up.\n30 This is as\u2019t should be.

My heart is wondrous light\nSince this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.\nExit all\n\u2756\u2756\u2756\nACT 4, SCENE 3\nJuliet sends the nurse and Lady Capulet from her bedroom on the pretext of getting rest. She then\nexperiences a series of doubts about the plan: what if the poison doesn\u2019t work? What if the Friar actually\nintends to kill her to preserve the sanctity of her first marriage? What if she wakes up too early and\nsuffocates? What if waking in the tomb will drive her insane? She rebuts most of these fears and drinks the\npoison, falling into a death-like trance.\nJuliet\u2019s chambers within the Capulet estate:\nEnter JULIET and NURSE\nJULIET\nAye, those attires are best; but gentle Nurse\nI pray thee leave me to myself tonight\nFor I have need of many orisons\u00b0 \u00b0prayers\nTo move the heavens to smile upon my state,\n5 Which, well thou know\u2019st, is cross and full of sin.\nEnter LADY CAPULET\nLADY CAPULET\nWhat, are you busy \u2013 do you need my help?\n17. Sensitivity note: housewife in this context represents another example of Shakespeare's assumed gender roles. Keep in mind\nthat though this may have been a common phrase in his time, it does not mean it was an accurate or respectful statement.\nAct 4 | 117 JULIET\nNo, madam, we have culled\u00b0 such necessaries \u00b0selected\nAs are behooveful\u00b0 for our state tomorrow. \u00b0necessary\nSo please you, let me now be left alone;\n10 And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,\nFor I am sure you have your hands full all\nIn this so sudden business.\nLADY CAPULET\nGoodnight.\nGet thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.\nExit NURSE and LADY CAPULET\nJULIET\n15 Farewell:\nGod knows when we shall meet again.\nI have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,\nThat almost freezes up the heat of life.\nI\u2019ll call them back again to comfort me.\u2014\n18\n20 Nurse!\u2014 What should she do here?\nMy dismal scene I needs must act alone.\nCome, vial.\nTakes out vial.\nWhat if this mixture should not work at all?\nShall I be married then tomorrow morning?\n25 No, no, this shall forbid it.\nTakes out knife.\nLie thou there.\nWhat if it be a poison, which the Friar\nSubtly hath ministered to have me dead,\nLest in this marriage he should be dishonored,\nBecause he married me before to Romeo?\n30 I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,\nFor he hath still been tried a holy man.\nHow, if when I am laid into the tomb,\nI wake before the time that Romeo\nComes to redeem me? There\u2019s a fearful point:\n18. Nurse: Juliet is breaking her soliloquy to call out for the nurse before quickly coming to her senses and thinking to herself\nagain.\n118 | Act 4 35 Shall I not then be stifled\u00b0 in the vault, \u00b0suffocated\nTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\nOr, if I live, is it not very like\u00b0 \u00b0likely\nThe horrible conceit\u00b0 of death and night, \u00b0notion; idea\n40 Together with the terror of the place\u2014\nAs in the vault, an ancient receptacle\nWhere for these many hundred years the bones\nOf all my buried ancestors are packed:\n19\nWhere bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\n45 Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,\nAt some hours in the night spirits resort\u00b0. \u00b0haunt\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I\nIn early waking, what with loathsome smells,\n20\nAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\n50 That living mortals hearing them run mad\u2014\nO, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\nEnvironed\u00b0 with all these hideous fears, \u00b0surrounded; buried\nAnd madly play with my forefathers\u2019 joints?\nAnd pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?\n55 And, in this rage, with some great kinsman\u2019s bone,\nAs with a club, dash out my desperate brains?\nO look, methinks I see my cousin\u2019s ghost,\nSeeking out Romeo that did spit\u00b0 his body \u00b0impale\nUpon a rapier\u2019s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!\n21\n60 Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here\u2019s drink; I drink to thee.\nShe drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtains.\n\u2756\u2756\u2756\nACT 4, SCENE 4\nThe Capulets work through the night in preparation.

And lead you even to death: i.e., be your leader in grief\n23. let mischance be slave to patience: i.e., let patience guide your misfortune\n24. make: give evidence\n25. For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined: i.e., Friar implies Juliet only care about Romeo and cares nothing for Tybalt.\n144 | Act 5 That he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from the borrowed grave\nBeing the time the potion\u2019s force should cease.\n255 But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stayed by accident, and yesternight\nReturned my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred\u2019s vault,\n260 Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,\n\u2018Til I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came some minute ere the time\nOf her awakening, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris, and true Romeo, dead.\n265 She wakes, and I entreated her come forth\n26\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me\nBut as it seems, did violence on herself.\n270 All this I know, and to the marriage her Nurse is privy.\n27\nAnd if aught in this miscarried by my fault,\nLet my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time\nUnto the rigor of severest law.\nPRINCE\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\n275 Where\u2019s Romeo\u2019s man? What can he say to this?\nBALTHASAR\nI brought my master news of Juliet\u2019s death,\nAnd then in post\u00b0 he came from Mantua, \u00b0by horseback\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\n280 And threatened me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\nPRINCE\nGive me the letter; I will look on it.\nWhere is the County\u2019s page that raised the Watch?\n28\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\n26. this work of heaven: i.e., this tragedy\n27. if aught in this miscarried by my fault: i.e., if anything in this was my fault\n28. what made your master: i.e., what was he doing?\nAct 5 | 145 PAGE\n285 He came with flowers to strew his lady\u2019s grave,\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to open the tomb,\nAnd, by and by, my master drew on him,\nAnd then I ran away to call the Watch.\nPRINCE\n290 [reading letter] This letter doth make good the Friar\u2019s words.\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor apothecary, and there with it\nCame to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.\n295 Where be these enemies? Capulet? Montague?\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\n29\nAnd I, for winking at your discords, too\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.\nCAPULET\n300 O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter\u2019s jointure\u00b0, for no more \u00b0dowry\nCan I demand.\nMONTAGUE\nBut I can give thee more,\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold\n30\n305 That whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall be no figure at such rate be set\u00b0 \u00b0praised\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\nCAPULET\n31\nAs rich shall Romeo\u2019s by his lady\u2019s lie,\nPoor sacrifices for our enmity.\nPRINCE\n310 A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\n29. winking at your discords: looking the other way\n30. whiles Verona by that name is known: while Verona is called Verona\n31.
