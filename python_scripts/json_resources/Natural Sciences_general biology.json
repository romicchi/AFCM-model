logos, word\nor knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is\nsometimes known as Life Science.\nThe science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany1, bacteriology,\nanatomy2, zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics3, molecular biol-\nogy4, systematics, immunology, microbiology5, physiology, cell biology6, cytology, ecology7,\nand virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,\nincluding paleontology8, taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-\ntomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and\nanthropology.\n2.1 Characteristics of life\nNot all scientists agree on the definition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics\ndescribe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can\nthink of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving\nbeing classified as living or something living classified as nonliving. Therefore we are careful\nnot to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.\n\u2022 Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple\nmolecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.\nAn easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,\nMove, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)\n\u2022 Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.\n\u2022 Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.\n\u2022 Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.\n\u2022 All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA9.\n1 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/botany\n2 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/anatomy\n3 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/genetics\n4 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Molecular%20Biology\n5 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/microbiology\n6 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cell%20Biology\n7 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ecology\n8 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/paleontology\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\n5 Biology - The Life Science\n\u2022 Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a\nliving thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis10.\nLiving things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells11. Atoms are\narranged into molecules, then into macromolecules12, which make up organelles13, which\nwork together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire\nmulticellular organisms. Cells together form tissues14, which make up organs, which are\npart of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond\nthis, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's\necosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.\nExample:-\nsub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,\ncommunity, eco systems\n2.2 Nature of science\nScience is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application\nof knowledge.\nThe scientific method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the\nformation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.\nReasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (specific data is used to\ndevelop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads\nto specific conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.\nScience as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.\n2.3 Scientific method\nThe scientific method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a\nmethodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists\nmust be able to have an \"imaginative preconception\" of what the truth is. Scientists will\noften observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all\nof their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that\nmight be true. A typical scientific investigation might go like so:\nYouobservethataroomappearsdark, andyouponderwhytheroomisdark. Inanattempt\nto find explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several different hypotheses. One\nhypothesis might state that the lights are turned off. Another hunch might be that the\nroom's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeostasis\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cell\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macromolecule\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle\n14 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FTissues\n6 Scientific method\nyou experiment. You feel your way around the room and find a light switch and turn it on.\nNo light. You repeat the experiment, flicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That\nmeans your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are off, has been rejected.\nYou devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a flashlight to prove that\nyou are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,\nyou could predict that changing the light bulb will fix the problem. If all your predictions\nsucceed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your\npredictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is off.\nFigure 1 How Science is Done\nA diagram that illustrates scientific investigation\nScientists first make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the\nobserved phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This\nis the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why\n7 Biology - The Life Science\nan event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible\nhypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of\ntheir hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are\nconfirmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been confirmed, the\nhypothesis then may become a theory.\nQuick Definitions\nObservation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.\nInference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.\nHypotheses - A suggested explanation.\nRejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.\nAccepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive\nexperimentation and makes verifiable predictions that are true.\nExperiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already\nknown.\nScientific Method - The process of scientific investigation.\nTheory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and\nusually never rejected.\nThe scientific method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.\nThis involves a control, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist\nwill also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum\nnumber of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you\nbelieve or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the\nhypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more firmly\nwhat is and what is not true.\nA founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the\nmost likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsification. All knowledge\nhas its relative uncertainty.\nTheories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsification. Common\ntheories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of\ncells. The scientific community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas\nthan contradicts them.\n8 Charles Darwin\n2.4 Charles Darwin\nFigure 2\nCharles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution\nthrough natural selection.\nThe seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a\nfive-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied\nfossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and\nrelatedness of island life forms, and the affinity of island forms to mainland forms.\nUpon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that\nevolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work\nbecauseofitscontroversialnature. However, whenanotherscientist, Wallace, reachedsimilar\nconclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis\nrevolutionized biology and has yet to be falsified by empirical data collected by mainstream\nscientists.\n2.5 After Darwin\nSince Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including\nmicroorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties\nto Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than\nDarwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of\nthe mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to\nDarwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.\nToday we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain\n(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.\n9 Biology - The Life Science\nThe molecular biology15 study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary\nhistory consistent with fossil and anatomical record.\n2.6 Challenges to Darwin\nFigure 3\nDarwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The\nchallenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conflict with the preconceived\nnotion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the\nyoung earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all\nspecies were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have\nsuggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were different or nonexistent in\nearlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientifically testable\nand fall outside the area of attention of the field of biology, or have been disproved by one\nor more fields of science.\nThis text is based on notes very generously donated by Dr. Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of Cleveland\nState University.\n15 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/molecular%20biology\n10 3 The Nature of Molecules\n3.1 Matter\nMatter is defined as anything that has mass1 (an amount of matter in an object) and\noccupies space2 (which is measured as volume3).\n\u2022 Particles, from smallest to largest\n1.

Evolution.\n5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses\n\u2022 Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe\n\u2022 evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L\nforms)\n\u2022 questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock\n-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have\nhad to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only difference would\nbe that life did not originate on Earth.\n\u2022 Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by\nnatural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)\n-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a\nchemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be\nin a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked\nfor religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating\nhumans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution\n19 Life: History and Origin\nwithout evidence of an \"in-between stage\" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are\ndisputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals\nhave been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons\nhave been sketched out from a limited number of bones.\n\u2022 Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of\nthis.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other\nIntelligent Designer).\n\u2022 Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only\nhave been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.\n-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often\nregarded as superstitious and/or unscientific.\n\u2022 It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking\nabout the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses\n(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this\nwikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or\nthe other.\n5.3 The early earth\nIt is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.\n\u2022 Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.\n\u2022 Reducing atmosphere: much free H\n\u2022 also H O, NH , CH\n2 3 4\n\u2022 little, if any, free O\n2\n\u2022 with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C\n\u2022 Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88\u00b0C\n\u2022 Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy\n2 3\nChemical reactions on early earth\n\u2022 UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic\nmolecules\n\u2022 Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment\n\u2022 simulated early atmospheric conditions\n\u2022 found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life\n\u2022 won Nobel prize for work\n\u2022 experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible\nIssues\n\u2022 Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of\nwhat is currently thought to be those of early earth\n\u2022 He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into\nreplicating molecules and cells\n\u2022 In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, significant issues and problems for biogenesis have been\nidentified. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.\n20 Origin of cells\n\u2022 Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.\n5.4 Origin of cells\nCells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells\ndo not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)\nwas created on Earth.\n\u2022 Bubble hypothesis\n\u2022 A.

The cell is the basic unit of all\nliving things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and\ncritical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as \"the building blocks of\nlife\". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one\ncell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.\nAccording to Cell Theory, first proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists\nof cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital\nfunctions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells\ncontain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate\nthemselves.\nAll cells contain:\n\u2022 Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane1)\n\u2022 Cytoplasm2\n\u2022 DNA3 (hereditary information)\n\u2022 Ribosomes4 for protein synthesis\nEukaryotic cells also contain:\n\u2022 At least one nucleus5\n\u2022 Mitochondria6 for cell respiration and energy\nCells may also contain:\n\u2022 Lysosomes7\n\u2022 Peroxisomes8\n\u2022 Vacuoles9\n\u2022 Cell walls10\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plasma%20membrane\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20Nucleus\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuole\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20Wall\n25 Cell structure\n7.1.1 Concepts\nPlasma Membrane\nPhospholipidbilayer,whichcontainsgreatamountofproteins,themostimportantfunctions\nare the following:\n1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.\n2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.\n3. Communicates with other cells.\nModel of the fluid mosaic\nDescribes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by\ncellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.\nPhospholipid bilayer\nIs in the plasma membrane and produces the fluid part of membranes.\nProteins\nLong chains of amino acids.\nGlucose proteins\nProteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts\nof the cell.\nFunctions of proteins\nTransport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with\nits environment.\nTransport Proteins\nRegulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some\ntransport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so\nthat water soluble molecules pass.\nCarrying proteins\nHave union sites that can hold specific molecules.\nReception proteins\nThey activate cellular responses when specific molecules join.\nProteins of recognition\nThey work as identifiers and as place of union to the cellular surface.\nFluid\nIt is any substance that can move or change of form.\nConcentration\nNumber of molecules in a determined unit of volume.\n26 What is a cell?\nGradient\nPhysical difference between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to\nmove in response to the gradients.\nDiffusion\nMovement of the molecules in a fluid, from the regions of high concentration to those of\nlow concentration.\nPassive transport\nMovement of substances in a membrane that doesn\u2019t need to use energy.\nSimple diffusion\nDiffusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.\nFacilitated diffusion\nDiffusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.\nOsmosis\nDiffusion of the water across a membrane with differential permeability.\nTransport that needs energy\nMovement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of\nconcentration with the requirement of energy.\nActive transport\nMovement of small molecules using energy (ATP).\nEndocytosis\nMovement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose\nparticles or liquids.\nPinocytosis\n(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.\nPhagocytosis\nWay of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.\nPseudopods\nFalse feet (the amoeba).\nExocitosis\nMovement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.\nIsotonic\nThe cytoplasm fluid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.\nHypertonic solution\n27 Cell structure\nThe solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular\ncytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.\nHypotonic\nThe solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell\nand that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.\nSwelling\nPressure of the water inside the vacuole.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum\nIt is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.\n7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell\nRudolf Virchow\nZoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells\ncould grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from\nother equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:\n1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells\n2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of\nthe multicellular organisms.\n3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.\n7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells\nMolecular components\nProteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.\nStructural components\nPlasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.\nRobert Hooke\nHe postuled for the first time the term cell\nProkaryotes\nTheir genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias\nEukaryotes\nTheir genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane\n28 History of cell knowledge\n7.2 History of cell knowledge\nThe optical microscope was first invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began\nto examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of\nlife. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:\n\u2022 The invention of the microscope11, which allowed scientists for the first time to see\nbiological cells\n\u2022 Robert Hooke12 in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called\ncork \"cells\"\n\u2022 Anton van Leeuwenhoek13 called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the\nmicroscope \"animalcules\"\n\u2022 Matthias Jakob Schleiden14, a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of\ncells\n\u2022 Theodor Schwann15, a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells\n\u2022 Rudolf Virchow16 proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells\nIn 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann\ndiscovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,\nthe two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.\nIn 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure\nand Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the first statement of their joint cell\ntheory.\n7.2.1 Cell Theory\nSchleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,\nbut spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis17) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow\nfamously stated \"Omnis cellula e cellula\"... \"All cells only arise from pre-existing cells.\" The\nparts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to\nscientific scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientific community today.\nThe generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the\nfundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up\nof one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry\ngenetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially\nthe same in chemical composition. (6) Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs\nwithin cells.\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microscope\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Hooke\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%20van%20Leeuwenhoek\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias%20Jakob%20Schleiden\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor%20Schwann\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf%20Virchow\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\n29 Cell structure\n7.3 Microscopes\n\u2022 Allow greater resolution, can see finer detail\n\u2022 Eye: resolution of \u02dc 100 \u03bcm\n\u2022 Light microscope18: resolution of \u02dc 200 nm\n\u2022 Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells\n\u2022 Confocal microscopy19: 2 dimension view\n\u2022 Electron microscope20: resolution of \u02dc0.2 nm\n\u2022 Laser tweezers: move cell contents\n7.4 Cell size\nOne may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneficial\nto the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical\nlimitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diffuse gases and nutrients in\nand out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a\nresult a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it\nis reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can\nbe large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a\nrelatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.\nThat is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less efficient at exchanging\nmaterials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These\ncells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture\nproteins locally within different parts of the cell.\nKey concepts: Cell size:\n\u2022 Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate\n\u2022 Diffuse oxygen and other gases\n\u2022 Transport of mRNA21 and protein22s\n\u2022 Surface area to volume ratio limited\n\u2022 Larger cells typically:\n\u2022 Have extra copies of genetic information\n\u2022 Have slower communication between parts of cell\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light%20microscope\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microscopy\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron%20microscope\n21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA\n22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protein\n30 8 Structure of Eukaryotic cells\nEukaryotic1 cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-\nsome2s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER3, SER4,\nlysosomes, vacuole5s, chloroplast6s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton7. Also, plants, fungi, and\nsome protists have a cell wall.\n8.1 Structure of the nucleus\nThe nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the\ncell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.\n8.1.1 Nuclear envelope\nThenuclearenvelopeisadouble-layeredplasmamembrane8 likethecellmembrane, although\nwithout membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear\nenvelope has structures called Nuclear pore9s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the\nendoplasmic reticulum.\n8.1.2 Nucleolus\nThe nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus\nis the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription10 taking place.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RER\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SER\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vacuole\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chloroplast\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cytoskeleton\n8 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Plasma%20membrane\n9 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Nuclear%20pore\n10 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/DNA%20transcription\n31 Structure of Eukaryotic cells\n8.2 Chromatin\nChromosomes consist of chromatin11. This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically\nmeasure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone12 core\nand organized into nucleosome13s.\nThe chromatin14 must be uncoiled for gene expression15 and replication16. Chromosome\nmicrograph\n8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum17 is a cellular organelle18 made up of a series of extended folded\nintracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.\nThere are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:\n\u2022 RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis19) associated with ribosomes\n\u2022 SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis20)\n8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum\nProteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide21s on\nthe ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-\nsome/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,\nthe signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open\nit. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to\ntranslate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes\ncan happen.\n1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein\nsynthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing\nprotein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus\nfor processing of the polypeptide.\n2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous\nsecretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the\nsignal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then\noccur.\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromatin\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/histone\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleosome\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromatin\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gene%20expression\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/replication\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endoplasmic%20reticulum\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protein%20synthesis\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipid%20synthesis\n21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polypeptide\n32 Endoplasmic reticulum\nWhen produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are\neither modified for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast\nwithribosomeswhichdonotassociatewiththeRERandproduceproteinswhichwillbecome\ncytosolic enzymes for example.\n8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum\nSmooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme22s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis\nand detoxification RER\n8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum\nThis is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-\nparticularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is different from the other 2 types in\nthat is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which\nrespond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.\nThis can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.\nFigure 1 :Image of nucleus23, endoplas-\nmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.\n1.

Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the\ncell nucleoli28 and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are\ncomposed of RNA and protein.\nProkaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are different, the eukaryotic ones being larger and\nmore complicated.\n8.6 DNA-containing organelles\nMitochondria\n\u2022 Double membrane\n\u2022 Aerobic metabolism, internal membrane\n\u2022 DNA, ribosomes\n\u2022 Give rise to new mitochondria\nChloroplast29\n\u2022 Double membrane\n\u2022 Photosynthesis, internal membrane\n\u2022 DNA, ribosomes\n\u2022 Give rise to new chloroplasts\nCentriole30s\n24 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi%20apparatus\n25 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbody\n26 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome\n27 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalase\n28 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleoli\n29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast\n30 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole\n34 Cytoskeleton\n\u2022 Microtubule organizing centers\n\u2022 Animal cells and many protists\n\u2022 Pair constitutes the centrosome\n\u2022 Give rise to flagellum during spermatogenesis\n\u2022 Consist of 9 triplet microtubules\n\u2022 Mitosis31, meiosis32\n8.7 Cytoskeleton\nCytoskeleton is a collective term for different filaments of proteins that can give physical\nshape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried\nalong.\n\u2022 Gives the cell shape\n\u2022 Anchors other organelles\n\u2022 Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules\nThe cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of filaments:\n\u2022 Actin33 filaments (7 nm)\n\u2022 Microtubule34s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.\n\u2022 Intermediate Filament35s\nBoth actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.\n8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments\nThese are rope like filaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to\ncells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neurofilaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply\nmakes up hair, nails and horns.\n8.7.2 Actin Filaments\nGrowth\nThese filaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They\ncontain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the\nstructure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin filaments is\nconcentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater\nthe polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and\npolymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.\n31 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitosis\n32 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meiosis\n33 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin\n34 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule\n35 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate%20Filament\n35 Structure of Eukaryotic cells\nCilia and flagella are threads of microtubules that extend from the exterior of cells and used\nto move single celled organisms as well as move substances away from the surface of the cell.\nmotor proteins-move, wave motion\n36 9 Membranes\n9.1 Biological membranes\nFigure 5 Plasma membrane bilayer\n37 Membranes\nBiologicalmembranessurroundcellsandservetokeeptheinsidesseparatedfromtheoutsides.\nThey are formed of phospholipid bilayer1s, which by definition are a double layer of fatty\nacid2 molecules (mostly phospholipid3s, lipids containing lots of phosphorus).\nProteins4 serveveryimportantfunctionsincellularmembranes.

More specifically, light\nturns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.\nHow the \"Chloroplast-Battery\" Charges ATP:\nThe stroma is the fluid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This\nmeans that it contains about a \"gazillion\" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.\nThe fluid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen\n(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the fluid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk\nfluid is water.\nA chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a\nstrong negative charge in two different compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions\n(free protons) flow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,\nsince it is a flow of charged particles.\nThe protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;\nthis reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given off is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is\nthe phosphate ion):\nADP + Pi --> ATP\nThe proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.\nSince one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the first reaction releases\nenergy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'\ntogether so that the first fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for\nthis to happen.\nChlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:\nHundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk\ngreen. The nonpolar \"tails\" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of\nthe thylakoid.\n52 \u201cDark\u201d reactions\n13.2 \u201cDark\u201d reactions\n\u2022 ATP drives endergonic reactions\n\u2022 NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)\n2\n\u2022 Occur in the stroma\n\u2022 First step in carbon fixation\n13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions\nWhat the Dark Reactions Do:\nThe dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy\nfrom ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions\noccur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they\ndon't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out\n(usually about 30 seconds).\nThe Calvin Cycle:\nThe Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This\nmeans that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of different enzymes\nto catalyze the reactions.\nCarbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms\nare strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon\natoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.\nWhen inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as\nsugar), this is called carbon fixation.\nIt takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.\nSome portions of this text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D.,\nof the Cleveland State University.

DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in\neach strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each\nstrand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a\nmillion matches out of sequence.\nHowever, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order differently\nthanintheparentchain,itcanbethebasisofamutation. ThesechangesinDNAsequences\nare the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest\ndifference in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the\norganism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the\nexample of Sickle cell anemia3 is commonly given as its origin is a difference of only one\nbase pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.\nIndividual sequences of DNA that encode for specific proteins are called genes and are the\nunits of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide4, and together all of the genes (and some\nsequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)\ntogether make up the entire chromosome5\n16.1 Mendel\n\u2022 Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants\n\u2022 Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes\n\u2022 Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios\n\u2022 Work is model of scientific method\n\u2022 In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and\nrecessive traits\n\u2022 Published work in 1866, went unnoticed\n\u2022 In 1900 his scientific paper was \u201crediscovered\u201d\n1 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle%20cell%20anaemia\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleotide\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome\n65 Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance\n\u2022 Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics\n\u2022 still used alphabet letters to designate genes\n\u2022 still refer to dominant and recessive genes\n\u2022 still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis\n\u2022 principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel\u2019s results\nwere immediately applied to humans in 1900\n16.2 Mendel\u2019s experiments\n\u2022 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum\n\u2022 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found\n\u2022 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society\n\u2022 Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because\nthe species did not undergo true fertilization\n\u2022 discrete traits in Pisum sativum\n\u2022 pure-breeding lines\n\u2022 dominant/recessive alleles\n\u2022 alleles are two alternate versions of a gene\n\u2022 gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis\n\u2022 homozygous has two of the same allele\n\u2022 heterozygous has two different alleles\n\u2022 reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3\n\u2022 counted offspring, noted ratios\n\u2022 inferred genotypes from phenotypes\n\u2022 tested hypotheses with testcrosses\n\u2022 attempted to repeat with another species\n16.3 Mendel\u2019s seven pairs of traits\n1.

Plant heights (tall or short)\n16.4 Locus\n\u2022 The location of a specific gene within a chromosome\n66 Modern Y chromosome\n16.5 Modern Y chromosome\nY-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-\nmosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex\ndetermining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and\nresults in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.\n16.6 Chromosome phenomena\n\u2022 X-chromosome inactivation\n\u2022 Barr bodies\n\u2022 Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis\n\u2022 Results in 2N \u00b1 1 chromosome number\n\u2022 Trisomy 2N + 1\n\u2022 Usually lethal.

The individual suffering from this type of\nsyndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex\nchromosome but an autosome.\nMost cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.\nThe affected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life\nexpectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the\nterm mongolism.\nKlinefelter's Syndrome\n67 Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance\nWhen an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called\nKlinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome\nshow the following characteristics:\n\u2022 testes are small\n\u2022 sperms are never produced\n\u2022 breasts are enlarged\n\u2022 body hair is sparse\n\u2022 individuals are mentally defective\nThe same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or\nno sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).\nThis is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the offspring.\n68 17 DNA: The Genetic Material\n17.1 DNA\nDNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is\nthe hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all\nkingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it\ndoes not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)\nWhen someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:\nThey may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double\nhelix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.\n\u2022 antiparallel\n\u2022 Double helix\n\u2022 Semiconservative replication\n\u2022 Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide\n17.2 Historical perspective\n\u2022 Mitosis and meiosis\n\u2022 Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-\ntion\n\u2022 Bridges/Morgan,usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes\n(1910s)\n\u2022 Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)\n\u2022 Griffith: transformation of bacteria (1928)\n\u2022 Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)\n\u2022 Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)\n\u2022 Rosalind Franklin\n\u2022 Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)\n17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment\nThe Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a\ngenetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA\ninto a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with\na radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the\nbacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria\n69 DNA: The Genetic Material\nwas radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria\nwas radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed\non in viruses.\n17.4 DNA/RNA components\n\u2022 Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869\n17.4.1 Structure of DNA\nDNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides.

A mutation event is when the\norder of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.\nMutations come in a number of forms:\n20.1 Point Mutations\nPoint mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form\nof substitutions, insertions and deletions:\n20.2 Substitution\nSubstitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of\nDNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing\nthe codon. The altered codon codes for a different amino acid substitution.The substitution\nmutations are of two types:\n1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another\npurine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)\n2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine\nor pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\n2 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FEvolution\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleotide\n81 Mutation\n20.2.1 Insertion\n20.2.2 Deletion\n20.3 Larger mutations\nLargermutationswhichinvolvemorethanonenucleotidealsoincludeinsertionsanddeletions,\nbut can also include inversions, rearrangement of nucleotides and duplication of entire genes:\n20.3.1 Inversion\n20.3.2 Rearrangement\n20.3.3 Gene/Exon Duplications\nTransposition\nRetrotransposition\n20.4 Chromosomal mutations\nChromosomal mutations involve changes to entire chromosomes.

Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations\nelsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.\nMutations can be classified by their effects:\n20.6.1 Silent Mutation\nSilent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid\nsequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within\nan intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the final\namino acid chain.\n20.6.2 Frameshift\n20.6.3 Missense Mutation\nMissense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to\ncause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein\nnonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.\n20.6.4 Nonsense Mutation\n20.7 Further reading\n20.7.1 Books\n\u2022 Jones, S. 1993. The Language of the Genes.

Classification does\nnot only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their\nproducts by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may\noccupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis\nmeans arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed\nby the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical\ncharacteristics of organisms to identify and differentiate between different species.\nLinneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish different levels of\nsimilarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.\nTo remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical\norder:\n\u2022 Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote\n\u2022 Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria\n\u2022 Phylum\n\u2022 Class\n\u2022 Order\n\u2022 Family\n\u2022 Genus\n\u2022 Species\nThe domain is the broadest category, while species is the most specific category available.\nThe taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise\nthings based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would\nbe classified as follows:\nEukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->\nLepus --> Lepus europaeus.\nBinomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the first word beginning\nwith a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case\nletter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was\nthe major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientific name can be also\nabbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its first letter followed by a period. In our\nexample, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.\nTaxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both specific methods of classifying an organism.\nThey help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused\nby common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is\n93 Classification of Living Things\nquite different from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between\ncrayfish and catfish, where one might believe that they both are fish when in fact, they are\nquite different.\nNomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement\nwith published rules.\n22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes\nRecall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.\nEukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.\nSome characteristics of eukaryotes are:\n\u2022 Large (100 - 1000 \u03bcm)\n\u2022 DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane\n\u2022 Genome consists of several chromosomes.\n\u2022 Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis\n\u2022 Mitochondria and other organelles present\n\u2022 Most forms are multicellular\n\u2022 Aerobic\nProkaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no\nmembrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:\n\u2022 Small (1-10 \u03bcm)\n\u2022 DNA circular, unbounded\n\u2022 Genome consists of single chromosome.\n\u2022 Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.\n\u2022 No general organelles\n\u2022 Most forms are singular\n\u2022 Anaerobic\n22.0.3 The Three Domains\nThe three domains are organised based on the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.\nToday's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and different from eukaryotes. This fact has\nbeen proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.\nThe three domains are as follows:\nArchea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme\nenvironments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.\nEubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria\nbelongs to this domain.\nEukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,\nFungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.\n94 Stem cells\n22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms\nUnderthethreedomainsaresixkingdomsintaxonomy. Thefirsttwo, PlantsandAnimals,\nare commonly understood and will not be expounded here.\nProtista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in\n1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are\nquite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between\norganisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit\nproperties of both animals and plants.\nFungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms\nand moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but\nwere recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.\nEubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which differ in appearance from the\norganisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell\nwalls made of peptidoglycan.\nArchae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as\nsalt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies\nhave shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not\nfound in any other organism)which differ them from other bacteria and which allow them to\nlive where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.\n22.0.5 Origins of Diversity\nThe diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed\nin climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much\nthat new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was first described\nby British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.\nFor an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are\naccidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most\neukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces\nhaploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into\na diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough\narrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an\nimmense potential of genetic variety.\nOne goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be\nachieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in\nanatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,\nDNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is\nused:\n\u2022 Anatomy:\nAlthough a horse and a human may look different, there is evidence that their arm structures\nare quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be different, but the anatomical\nstructures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in different taxa may not\n95 Classification of Living Things\nbe that different. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as\nhomologous.\n\u2022 Development\n\u2022 Biochemistry:\nBiochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For\nexample, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry\nled them to be in their taxon of their own.\n22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram\nModern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,\nknown as phylogeny. As with the Scientific Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the\nhistory of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.\nCladistics is a classification system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,\ncladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common\nancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these\nrelated species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique\ncharacteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics\nThe principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,\na branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A\ncladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In\norder to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species\nare matched and analysed.\n22.0.7 Classification of Living Things Practice Questions\n1. If taxonomists had to select an existing kingdom to reclassify, which of the six would\nmost likely be chosen? Why?\n2.

Which\nof the following choices is the most informative?\na) Both organisms are brown.\nb) Both organisms have a tail.\nc) Both organisms have ears.\nd) Both organisms are nocturnal.\n7. DNA analysis is usually done using DNA found in a cell's mitochondria, and not in a\ncell's nucleus. From your knowledge of mitosis, explain why this is so.\n1.

However,\nthey are not biological organisms so they are not classified in any kingdom of living things.\nThey do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses\nare merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.\nViruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are\ncompletely inert.\nSince first being identified in 1935, viruses have been classified into more than 160 major\ngroups. Viruses are classified based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases\nthattheycause. Furthermore,theshapeofavirusisdeterminedbythetypeandarrangement\nof proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classified into 21 groups.\nViruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-\nphages.\n97 Classification of Living Things\n22.2 Viral Replication\nAs previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by\nthemselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate\nits DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.\nInordertoenteracell,avirusmustattachtoaspecificreceptorsiteontheplasmamembrane\nof the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which fit exactly into a\nmatching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein\nis not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.\nThere are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.\n22.2.1 Lytic Cycle\n1. Attachment: The virus binds to specific receptors on the host cell.\n2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject\nits nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the\nhost cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus\nbreaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.\n3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's\nDNA or RNA.\n4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.\n5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages\nthe host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus\nparticles are now released.\n22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle\n1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle\n2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle\n3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by\ngenetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated\nin a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is\nknown as a prophage.\n4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,\ndaughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.\n5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes\nthe lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can\nswitch to the lytic cycle.\nThe reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly different. A notable\nexample of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.\n98 Viral Genome\nRetrovirus reproductive cycle\n1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See\nabove).\n2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a\nDNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.\n3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the first. With\nthese two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.\n4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of\na prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never\nleaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.\n5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.\n22.3 Viral Genome\nThe genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and configuration vary. The\nentire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.\nAlso, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or\ncircular.\nNot all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the\nsize of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only\nmaking a few different proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human\ngenome codes for over 30,000 different proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions\ncause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.\nSuch viruses are called replication defective.\nLastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA\nreplication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA\nviruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.\n22.4 Viruses Practice Questions\n1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be\npossible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.\n2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more\ndifficult to detect?\n3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes\nsimplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they\nwill reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the\nherpes simplex virus undergo?\n4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused\nby the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suffer from shingles, an altered\nform of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have\nundergone?\n5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suffering from a cold of flu?

This is the kingdom of organisms\nwith strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms\nwhich do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.\n22.9 Classification of Protists\nThere are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.\n1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.\n2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.\n3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like\nprotozoa.\n22.10 Protozoa\nAs heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators\nwhich actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a\nsource of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,\nlike humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.\nProtozoa are generally difficult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as\njelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a flattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2\n\u03bcm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.\nFurthermore, different protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has\nled certain organisms to be mistakenly classified for other species.\nNevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classified based on their methods of\nlocomotion.\nCharacteristics of Protozoa :\n\u2022 About 30,000 species known\n\u2022 About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases\n\u2022 heterotrophic\n\u2022 highly variable in form and life cycle\n101 Classification of Living Things\n\u2022 mostly unicellular\n\u2022 range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm\n\u2022 lack cell walls\nthey love environment and each other..............\n22.11 Algae\nAlgae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can\nexist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classified as\nplants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,\nand phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to\ndenote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can differ in size and shape as\nwell.\nThere are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),\nrhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoflagellates),\nand euglenophytes (euglenoids).\n22.11.1 Chlorophytes\nChlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and\nthey store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most\nchlorophytes use flagellae for some locomotion.\n22.11.2 Phaeophytes\nPhaeophytesarenearlyallmulticellularmarineorganisms,whichareknowntousasseaweeds.\nThey have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).\nThe cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out\nwhen exposed to air at low tide.\nSince phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, flat fronds (a large leaf)\nwhich can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky\nseabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in\nareas of cold water.\n22.11.3 Rhodophytes\nRhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller\nthan brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in\nthe ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which\npenetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to\nresist drying.\n102 Slime molds & Water molds\n22.11.4 Chryosophytes\nChryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one\nof the biggest components of plankton, a free-floating collection of microorganisms, eggs,\nand larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a significant amount of atmospheric\noxygen.\nThe reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms\nreproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer\nlayer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must fit\ninside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one\nbefore. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a\nzygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.\n22.11.5 Pyrrophytes\nPyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats\ncomposed of stiff cellulose. They are more easily identifiable, due to the presence of two\nflagellae. The longer flagellae propels the dinoflagellate, while the second shorter, flatter\nflagellae functions as a rudder.\nSome species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make\ntheir home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning\nthe favour of sheltering them, dinoflagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through\nphotosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.\nA negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoflagellates\nreproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoflag-\nellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,\nand additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.\n22.11.6 Euglenophytes\nLike pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two flagella.\nThey are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive\nstructure called an eyespot.\n22.12 Slime molds & Water molds\nThere are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.\n22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)\nOomycotes are filamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.\nOomycotes differ from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.\n103 Classification of Living Things\n22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)\nMyxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed\nand dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.\n22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive\ncycle\nAcrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-\nfavourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-\nium.\nReproductive Cycle:\n1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.\n2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.\n3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.\n4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by\nmeiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.\n5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals\nor the wind.\n6. Cycle repeats.\n22.13 Protists Practice Questions\n1.

Afewtypesoffungiareunicellular. Forexample, yeastslive\nas individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.\nTheir bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of fine filaments. In a mushroom, the\n111 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\nhyphae are densely packed so it is difficult to see the individual structures when a mushroom\nis eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.\nThe main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.\nIn the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal\ncell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa\nare porous, allowing cytoplasm to flow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a\nhard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,\nbranching, multinucleate cells.\n23.24 Nutrition\nFungi are saprophytes. When they find a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,\nthey decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the\nsubstrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where\nthey are used to allow growth and repair.\nFungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the\nhuman foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate\nhost cells without immediately killing them.\nHowever, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or\nanimals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this\nrelationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits:\n\u2022 Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals\nfrom the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic\nnutrients) while delivering food to the plant.\n\u2022 The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the\nplant roots.\n\u2022 The fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the roots.\n\u2022 The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.\n23.25 Fungal Reproduction\nFungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-\nmentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken off, which then grow into new\nmycelia.\nThe second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed\nto be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects\nand birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.\nSpores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the\nfour phylla of fungi.\n112 Types of Fungi\n23.26 Types of Fungi\n23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)\nThis phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this\nphyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.\n1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating\nstrain -, combine and fuse together.\n2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation\nof a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is\nNOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.\n3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and\nother hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.\n4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy\n(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce\ndiploid zygosporangia.\n5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.\n6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from\nthe sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.\n7. Back to step #1.\n23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)\nThis phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages\nof this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.\n1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating\nstrain -, combine and fuse together.\n2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium\ngrows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.\n3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-\nvelop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.\n4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then\nundergo karyogamy.\n5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a\nterm referring to a basidiomycete's spores.\n6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp,thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,\nand are dispersed by the wind when mature.\n7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived\nhaploid mycelia.\n113 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\n8. Back to Step #1.\n23.27 Key Terms\nsynapomorphy\n23.28 Introduction\nWhat makes an animal an animal?\nIfanimalsareamonophyletictaxon, thenanimalsshouldbeabletobedefinedbysynapomor-\nphies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT definethis orany taxon using\nsymplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters\n(the independent evolution of similarity, or \"convergent evolution\"). See pages 654 - 656 and\nFig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed\nbelow, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.\n23.29 Characteristics of an Animal\n\u2022 There is no one universally accepted definition of an animal. The following treatment\nfollows your text, beginning on page 876.\n\u2022 Animals:\n\u2022 Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes ...\n\u2022 Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi\n\u2022 Share unique characteristics ...\n\u2022 Share certain reproductive characteristics ...\n\u2022 Other commonly used definitions ...\nAnimals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes\n\u2022 Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:\n\u2022 Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.\n\u2022 Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.\n\u2022 Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.\n\u2022 Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.\n\u2022 However, there is a difference here between animals and fungi. Animals generally\ntake in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are\nabsorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then\nabsorb the resulting nutrients.\nAnimals share unique characteristics\n\u2022 Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.\n\u2022 Only animals have collagen, a structural protein\n\u2022 Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,\nFigure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)\n114 Characteristics of an Animal\n\u2022 Tight junctions (sealing function)\n\u2022 Desmosomes (anchoring function)\n\u2022 Gap junctions (communication function)\nAnimals share certain reproductive characteristics\n\u2022 Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.\n\u2022 In most animals, a small, haploid, flagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,\nnonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.\n\u2022 Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A\nsynapomorphy? This feature could be another \"unique characteristic\" shared by animals.\n\u2022 Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage\n(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva\n(plural: larvae).\nOther commonly used definitions or characterizations\n\u2022 It is surprisingly difficult to find two texts that agree on a precise definition of an animal.\nHere are a few perspectives from some other texts.\n\u2022 Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest\ntheir food.\n\u2022 Animalsaremotile,thoughmanyaresecondarilysessile. Gametesusuallyareproduced\ninmulticellularsexorgans,andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude\na blastula.\n\u2022 Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They\nare heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed\nfrom two different haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a\nblastula.\n\u2022 Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia.

The number of species is estimated to be between\n5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.\nAnimals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no\nnervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as\nbeing essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a\nfree swimming larva.\nTheir bodies are porous. They are filter feeders; water flows in through many small openings,\nand out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable\nmiddle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called\nspicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and fibres made of spongin (a form of collagen).\n117 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\nChoanocytes are flagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and\ntrap and phagocytize food particles.\nTheir cells remain totipotent, or developmentally flexible: they can become any type of\ncell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power\nsponges have.\nSponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and\npossibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They\nsomehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).\nMany organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor\nendosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoflagellates, a.k.a. \"zooxanthellae\").\n23.32 Phylum Cnidaria\nSee text pages 886 - 889.\nName comes from the Greek knide- meaning \"nettle\".\nThis phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall\nhas an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undifferentiated middle layer\ncalled mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered\nto be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually\nextend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.\n118 Phylum Cnidaria\nFigure 7 Jellyfish Development\nThere are two basic body plans: the polyp14 and the medusa15. The polyp is sessile and\nattaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa\n(\"jellyfish\") is a floating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some\ncnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have\nboth.\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29\n119 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\nThe typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called \"alternation of generations\": an\nalternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.\nThe tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular \"harpoons\" that\nfunction in defense and prey capture. When fired, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that\nin some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.\nCnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas\nexchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a \"nerve net.\"\nMany cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic\nrelationship (Dinoflagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of\nthe primary productivity of coral reefs.\nThere are three main classes in the phylum\n\u2022 ClassHydrozoa16 (hydrasandPortugeseman-of-wararewell-knownbutatypicalexamples\nof this Class)\n\u2022 Class Scyphozoa17 (jellyfish)\n\u2022 The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.\n\u2022 Class Anthozoa18 (sea anemones, most corals)\n\u2022 No medusa (jellyfish) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this\ngroup. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual \"corals\" grow.\n23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes\nSee text pages 890 - 893.\nName means \"flat worm\"\nMost members of this phylum are parasitic (flukes and tapeworms), but some are free living\n(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.\nThey are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., \"flat\").\nAnimals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-\nmented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior \"brain\" and a simple ladder-like nervous\nsystem. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange\nsystems. Theydohavesimpleexcretory/osmoregulatorystructures(protonephridiaor\"flame\ncells\").\nPlatyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex\nreproductive (life) cycles.\nThere are four main classes of platyhelminths:\n\u2022 Class Turbellaria19 (mostly free living flatworms, e.g., planaria)\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria\n120 Phylum Rotifera\n\u2022 Class Monogenea20 (parasitic flukes)\n\u2022 Class Trematoda21 (parasitic flukes, e.g., liver fluke and the human blood fluke, Schisto-\nsoma)\n\u2022 Class Cestoda22 (tapeworms)\n\u2022 Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or\ndigestive system.\n23.34 Phylum Rotifera\nSee text page 900\nThe Rotifers. The name means \"wheel bearing,\" a reference to the corona, a feeding structure\n(see below).\nThey are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered\npseudocoelomates.\nMost less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.\nRotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the\ncorona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The\ncorona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,\nmouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized\ncirculatory or gas-exchange structures.\nMost live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They\ntypically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.\nParthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is\ncommon. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,\nsexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and\nare haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a\ndiploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily\nwhen living conditions are unfavorable.\nMoststructuresinrotifersaresyncytial(\"amulitnucleatemassofprotoplasmnotdividedinto\nseparate cells,\" or \"a multinucleated cell\") and show eutely (here, \"constant or near-constant\nnumber of nuclei\").\n23.35 Phylum Nematoda\nSee text pages 894 - 895.\nName from the Greek for \"thread\".\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea\n21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda\n22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda\n121 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\nThis phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the\ntrue number probably is 10 - 100 times this!\nThese animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.\nThey are vermiform, or wormlike.\nIn cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).\nProbably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.\nThey have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange\nstructures. The body has only longitudinal muscle fibers. The sexes are separate.\nNematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic\nimportance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much\nanywhere.\nIn one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal\nmud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!\nNematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other\nanimals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species\nCaenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number\n(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).\n23.36 Phylum Annelida\nSee text pages 906 - 909.\nName means \"ringed\", from the Greek annulatus.\nThis phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many different\nnames (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.\nAnimals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.\nDevelopment is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and\na well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal \"bristles\"\n(setae or chaetae).\nMost are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere sufficient water is\navailable. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.\nMajor advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal\nand circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory\nsystem (metanephridia).\nThere are three main classes of Annelids\n\u2022 Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)\n\u2022 Class Polychaeta (marine worms)\n\u2022 Class Hirudinea (leeches)\n122 Phylum Arthropoda\n23.37 Phylum Arthropoda\nFigure 8 Arthropods\nName means \"jointed feet\".\nThis phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the\nlargest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that\nthe true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.\nThis phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.\nBecause of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been\nnamed.\nThese animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.\nThe coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They\nhave an open circulatory system.\nThemostnotableadvancementofthisphylumisarigidexoskeleton. Ithasmajorimplications\nin these organisms' locomotion, flexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and\ngrowth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.\nThere are several major groupings of arthropods:\nMajor subgroups include:\n\u2022 The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike\nfeeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.\n\u2022 The Trilobites...they get their own grouping\n123 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\n\u2022 The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-\nbranched (uniramous) appendages.\n\u2022 The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of\nantennae and branched (biramous) appendages.\nMajor Classes Include\n\u2022 Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)\n\u2022 Class Diplopoda (millipedes)\n\u2022 Class Chilopoda (centipedes)\n\u2022 Class Insecta (insects)\n\u2022 Class Crustacea (crabs, crayfish, lobsters, shrimp)\n23.38 Phylum Mollusca\nSee text pages 900 - 905.\nName means \"soft\".\nThis phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.\nAbout 110,000 species\nAll molluscs have a similar body plan:\n\u2022 A muscular foot, usually used for movement.\n\u2022 A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.\n\u2022 A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if\npresent.\n\u2022 Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.\nMolluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but\nthe coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-\nopment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.\nLarge, complex, metanephridia (excretion).\nMany molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of\nannelids.\nThere are several major classes of molluscs:\n\u2022 Class Polyplacophora (chitons)\n\u2022 Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)\n\u2022 Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)\n\u2022 Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)\n23.39 Phylum Echinodermata\nName means \"spiny skin\"\nThis phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.\n124 Phylum Chordata\nEchinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.\nAs adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally\nsymmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.\nEchinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system\nof fluid-filled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,\nlocomotion, and gas exchange.\nThere are six major classes of echinoderms:\n\u2022 Class Asteroidea (sea stars)\n\u2022 Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)\n\u2022 Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)\n\u2022 Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)\n\u2022 Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)\n23.40 Phylum Chordata\nName means \"the chordates\", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their\nlifecycle.\nThis phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.\nThere are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.\n\u2022 A notochord, or a longitudinal, flexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve\ncord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This\nis the structure for which the phylum is named.\n\u2022 A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube\nlocated dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally\nlocated. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and\nspinal cord.\n\u2022 Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without\ncontinuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,\nthese function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modified for\ngas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.\n\u2022 A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of\nmost nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal\nelements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.\nChordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved\nindependently from the segmentation of annelids.\nThree subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:\n\u2022 Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-\nhydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates\nare characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are filter\nfeeders. The only \"chordate\" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.\n125 Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs\nLarval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult\nurochordates.\n\u2022 Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their\nblade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually\nlive on the bottom, but can swim.\n\u2022 Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...\nFormally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.\n23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata\nVertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.\nThis subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.\nVertebrates show extreme cephalization.\nThe notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.\nNeural Crest Cells\nLater in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage\ncells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the\ncranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.\nSome scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.\nNeural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.\n126 24 Chordates\nThe phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate\nchordates.\n24.1 Characteristics\nNotochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all\nchordates, including vertebrates\nFlexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,\nhydrostatic, fluid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles\ntensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much\nbetter locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.\nPharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,\npasses through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium\nand then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.\nDorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord\nPostanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into\ntail, early locomotive function led to success.\nNon-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):\n\u2022 bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)\n\u2022 segmented muscles and bones\n24.2 Subphylum Urochordata\nThe tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,\nthese two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have\nnotochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, filter-feeders\nwhich retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,\nwhich gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter\nthe incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,\nand leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through\nthe anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In\nurochordates notochord is confined to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open\ntype of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.\n127 Chordates\n24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata\nThe lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these\ntwo subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their\nbladelike shape. They resemble fish but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few\ncentimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths\nprotruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.\nDropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes\nBranchiostoma (\u201camphioxus\u201d).\n24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata\n(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks\nfirmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.\nVertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into\norgan systems.\nAll vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral\nsymmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered\nheart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs\nVertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -\nRespiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System\n\u2022 Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,\nspongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is\nan injury to this.)\n\u2022 Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory\norgans of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.\nWhat evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher\nchordate animals?\nPaedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what\nhad previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic\nintotheadult(adult=sexuallyreproducing)stage. Somescientistsbelievethatthisoccurred\nin a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile\n(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in\nthe larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae\ngot bigger physics shows that the cilia become less efficient for locomotion, favoring the\nundulating motion allowed by a notochord.\nIs this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayfly, which\nhas almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief\nday of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn\u2019t even have usable mouthparts.\nTunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile\n(\u201cattached\u201d).\n128 Subphylum Vertebrata\n24.4.1 Class Agnatha\n\"jawless fish\"\n\u2022 Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive fins and massive plates of bony\ntissue on their body.\n\u2022 Cyclostomes: \"circle mouth\" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of\nlampreys and hagfish.\nAppeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100\nmillion years. The first group of fish to appear. They had neither jaws, paired fins, nor\nscales, but they were the first organisms with a backbone.\nClass Acanthodia\n\"spiny fish\" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of fish that developed\njaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.\nClass Placodermi\nAppeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An\nextinct class of fish with massive heads.\n24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes\n\"cartilaginous fish\" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony fish. Includes sharks,\nskates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the\nmineral calcium carbonate.\nThe main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood\ncirculation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton\nof cartilage - paired, fleshy pectoral and pelvic fins - asymmetrical tail fin prevents sinking -\nfatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -\nno external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded\n24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes\n\"bony fish\" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous fish.

Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.\nOrder Dipnoi\nlung fishes, two groups isolated when continents separated\n129 Chordates\nOrder Crossopterygii\nincludes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved\ninto a swim bladder in bony fishes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex\nfolding of enamel.\n\u2022 Skeleton made of bone, jaws, fins, most with scales, two-chambered heart.\n24.4.4 Class Amphibia\nmeans \u201cboth lives\u201d, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-\nLoop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through\nSkin)\nOrder Salientia\nfrogs (jumping) (aka Anura)\nOrder Urodela\nsalamanders (tailed)\nLabyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from\ncrossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.\nAmphibians have limbs instead of fins. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial\nand connected, support body on legs.\nLisamphybia: no scales, \u201csmooth\u201d, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).\nAmphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and\ntherapsids.\nClass Reptilia\namniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have\nfour extra-embryonic membranes:\n\u2022 Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in fluid sac.\n\u2022 Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.\n\u2022 Chorion: gas exchange\n\u2022 Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor\nReptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.\nSometimes defined as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.\nReptiles can be classified by skull structure into four groups:\n\u2022 Anapsid\n\u2022 Synapsid\n\u2022 Diapsid\n\u2022 Euryasid\n130 Subphylum Vertebrata\nRefers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull\nDermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.\nSubclass Anapsidia\nSubclass Testudinata\nturtles1, terrapins\nSubclass Diapsida\ndinosaurs2, snakes3, most stuff\nSubclass Synapsida\nOrder Therapsids\nSubclass Diapsida\nincludes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea\nmonsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to\n\u2022 birds\n\u2022 dinosaurs\n\u2022 crocodilians\nDinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure\n\u2022 Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal\n\u2022 Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal\nCrocodilians: comefromarchosaurs, theonlyextant(stilllivingtoday)archosaurdescendant.\nAncestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.\nSynapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to\nmammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals\nPelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and\nunder body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than\nconstant push-up. Teeth differentiated into different types, for pre-processing of food needed\nby higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.\n1 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/turtle\n2 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/dinsosaur\n3 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/snake\n131 Chordates\nClass Aves\narose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modified for flight. Feathers:\nepidermal derivative, made of keratin (like fingernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary\nflight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed\nto support flight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as\ncontrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why\nare there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only\nexothermic animals.\nArchaeopteryx: \u201cancient wing\u201d, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found\nin Zolenhoffen, German sandstone mine with fine sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly\nafter Darwin\u2019s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no\nsternum, bony tail, not a good flyer but did have primary flight feathers.\nArchaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.\nPaleognathae: gave rise to Australian flightless birds.\nNeognathae: remaining live birds.\nClass Mammalia\nTwo unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:\n\u2022 Hair\n\u2022 Mammary glands\n(don\u2019t fossilize well)\nThree skeletal characteristics (fossilize)\n\u2022 Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)\n\u2022 Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)\n\u2022 Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles\nthis joint is between other bones)\nMammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor\nNon diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):\n\u2022 Warm-blooded\n\u2022 Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands\n\u2022 Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air\n\u2022 Heterodonty (differentiated teeth)\n\u2022 Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (\u201cdeciduous\u201d teeth, drop out) (reptile\nteeth are continually replaced)\nSubclass Protheria\nmonotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening\nfor excretion and urination.\n132 Subphylum Vertebrata\nSubclass Theria\nMetatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placentalmammals(allcommon\nmammals)\nMarsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than\nin Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny offspring crawls into a pouch\nwhere it completes development latched onto a teat.\nRecent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two different mammal groups\nmay have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a \u201crough draft\u201d for\nplacental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to\nthe same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the offspring and\nincrease its own chance of survival.\n133  25 Tissues and Systems\n135  26 Epithelial tissue\nComes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a\nsurface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to\n\u2022 animal interior (forming the lumen) or\n\u2022 exterior of its body cavity.\nThe other side rests on the basal layer.\nEpithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.\nTwo categories:\n\u2022 sheets\n\u2022 glands\nClassified on two features:\n\u2022 simple, (a single layer of cells),\n\u2022 stratified, (more than one cell layer.)\nCell shape at free surface:\n\u2022 squamous (broad and flat)\n\u2022 cuboidal (spherish)\n\u2022 columnar (tall and thin)\nSimple squamous epithelium\nusually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph\nvessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous\nmembranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ\nSimple cuboidal epithelium\nin ducts like kidney and salivary glands.\nSimple columnar epithelium\nnonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and\nlungs\nStratified squamous epithelium\n(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, flat and keratinized,\nmaking them resistant to abrasion. Stratified squamous epithelium changes to columnar\nsquamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.\nEpidermis\n137 Epithelial tissue\nfrom epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.\nTwo specialized epithelia:\n\u2022 pseudostratified\n\u2022 transitional\nPseudostratified epithelia\nlines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks\nstratified but not.\nTransitional epithelia\nfound only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell\nlayers deep.\nGlandular epithelia\n(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands\nare classified into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.\nEndocrine glands\nsecrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.\nExocrine glands\nsecrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include\nsweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.\n138 27 Connective tissue\nThis is a \u201cgrab bag\u201d category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and\nsupporting. Types include bone, cartilage, fibrous connective tissue, blood and\nadipose (fat) tissue.\nIf you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you\u2019d still be able to\nsee the basic form of the body.\nForm: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularfibergrounded\nin a ground substance (excluding blood)\nTypes:\n1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)\n2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).\nFibroblasts form connective tissue proper;\nchondoroblasts form cartilage;\nosteoblasts form bone;\nand blood is formed from various sources.\nGround substance: \u201cunstructured\u201d material that fills space between cells and contains\nfibers. Made of\n1. interstitial fluid (bathes cells)\n2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs\nsuch as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy\nto gelatin-like)\n3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the fibers).\nFibers of connective tissue:\n139 Connective tissue\n1. Collagen (flexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant\nprotein in animals, white)\n2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)\n3. andreticulin (like collagen).\nLoose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include fi-\nbroblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and\nelastic fibers. Ground substance is \u201csyrupy\u201d. Adipose included.\nDense connective tissue: largely densely packed fibers of collagen or elastin regularly\nor irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules\naround organs and joints, and dermis of skin.\nCartilage vs. bone\nFeature Bone Cartilage\ncell type osteocytes chondrocytes\nground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate\nvascularization vascular avascular\nmicro architecture highly ordered less organized\nunits called osteons\nfibrous sheath peristeum perichondrium\nCartilage: There are three cartilage types:\n1. hyaline cartilage\n2. fibrocartilage (fibrous cartilage)\n3. elastic cartilage\nHyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of\nlong bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to\nglassy appearance. In embryo, bones form first as hyaline cartilage, later ossifies. Found\nin tracheal rings. Few collagen fibers.\nFibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen fibers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic\nsymphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.\nElastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in\nepiglottis, yellow when fresh.\nChondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diffusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct\nblood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.\n140 Subphylum Vertebrata\nBone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit\ncalled osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood\nvessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our\nconcern: simple pattern for mammals.\nLacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,\nlayers of bone called lamellae.\nThree types of bone cells, ending in\n-blast, (mend bone)\n-cyte (fortify bone)\n-clast (tear down bone)\nClassified by\n1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)\n2. where found (outside or inside)\n3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms first and then is ossified, and\nentramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)\nExample of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,\ncalcified region expands and cuts off diffusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In\nyoung mammals, secondary ossification centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped\nby sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossified. In other animals, bones continue growing\nthroughout their lifetime.\nThree types of intramembrous bone:\n1. dermal bone\n2. sessamoid bone\n3. perichondral bone.\nDermal boneformsskull, shoulder/pectoralgirdle, andintegument, descendedfromdermal\narmor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.\nSessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with\nstress.\nPerichondral bone means \u201caround cartilage,\u201d forms around cartilage or bone. Func-\ntions in bone repair and in ossification of endochondral bone.\n141 Connective tissue\nBone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,\nwhich, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.\nOsteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts\nand lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is\npreventative maintenance.\nWhen bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with\ncalcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue fixing over\ntime and slowly removing imperfection.\n142 28 Muscle tissue\nMesodermalinorigin,musclehasseveralfunctions: supply force for movement,restrain\nmovement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food\ndown digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between\nstomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, affect air\nflow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.\nSecondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement\nmetabolism).\nMuscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical field created by fish\nmuscles. Some fish formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators\nor stun prey. Other fish can use field as \u201cradar\u201d to see things and communicate with other\nanimals. (Evolved independently in different groups).\nDifferent classifications: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system\ncontrol (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-\npearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)\nStriated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called\nfibers, grouped into fascicle. Myofibrils founding one cell made of even smaller myofil-\naments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to\nform longer composite fibers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myofibrils. Two\nkinds of myofilaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible\nin light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.\nCardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.\nEach band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined\ntogether with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-\nlated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart\ntransplants.)\nSmooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral\nfunction: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),\nlungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,\nfusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.\nStriated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myofibrils.\nRepeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myofilaments:\n1. thick, myosin filament\n2. thin, actin filament.\n143 Muscle tissue\nSarcomere: Thick and thin filaments interspersed in ordered grid.\nSliding filament theory: thick and thin filaments move past each other in opposite\ndirection, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell\nbio for details).\nMyosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.\nMyosin filament: many slender myosin molecules together.\nActin filament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular\ntroponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites\nthat bind to actin. Actin filaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.\nTroponin has four sites:\n1. one to bind myosin\n2. one for actin\n3. one for tropomyocin\n4. one for calcium ions\nNerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,\nthat diffuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.\nReceptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels\nthrough t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.\nLacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and\nheads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move fibers in relation to each other.\nMyocin head then interacts with ATP to get \u201crecocked\u201d, if myosin still exposed then it\nfires again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,\nsarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.\nQuirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine\nreceptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can\u2019t\nbreathe.\nDuchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of\nmuscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.\nFast and slow twitch fibers: vertebrate muscle fiber. Terms relative within one group\nof animals. Differences related to differences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin\nactivation.\nTwo parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy\nstored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue\naround tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,\nlike fish swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)\n144 Subphylum Vertebrata\nHow does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:\n1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force\nincreases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.\n2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a fixed number of\nmuscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor\nunits may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.\nHow do muscles grow stronger?\n1. add more myofilaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets\nworking\n2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle\nMuscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add\nmore cross sectional area.\nPinnate fibers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-\nstances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.\nVelocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation\nbetween fibers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same\npercentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is\ngreater.\nSynergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.\nBicep shares work with brachialis.\nAntagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls\nit back out.\nOrigin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more fixed in its attachment to\nthe body. The more movable end called insertion.\nFixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you\nclench your fist hard.\nFlexors and extensors: appliedmainlytolimbs. Flexorbendsonepartrelativetoanother\nabout limb, extensor straightens it.\nAdductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor\nmoves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).\n145  29 Vertebrate digestive system\nFunctions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive\nmembrane.\nDigestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or\nmonotreme.\nLumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).\nTract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal\nAlimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.\nlarge intestine\nAccessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract\nthrough ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.\nBuccal cavity,whichincludespalateandtongue,developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,\nor second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the\nprimitive gut.\nTeeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down\nfood into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.\nTooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer\ncoating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,\nbone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.\n(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with different types of teeth).\nPharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of\ngills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: first pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts\nof the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.\nAlimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and\ncircular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).\nEsophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to fit large bolus (lump\nof chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement\nof esophagus.\nEpiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary \u201ckludge,\u201d or fix.\nStomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,\nreleased by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds\nof stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.\nChyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.\n147 Vertebrate digestive system\nSmall intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.\nDuodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal\nabsorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:\nCircular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).\nVilli: finger-likecellularprojections,coveredwithmicrovilli,tinyprojectionswhichincrease\nsurfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x,speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption\n(taking in nutrients).\nLarge intestine: largerdiameter, shorterlengththansmallintestine. Novilli. Inmammals,\nforms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside\nworld through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released\nby bacteria which live there (vitamin K).\nFood: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. fibrous material.\nDigestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be\nabsorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-\nerides to absorb.\nSalivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins\nstarch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.\nBreaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.\nStomach enzymes: releasedininactiveform, zymogene, convertstoactiveforminlumen\nof gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach\u2019s low pH. Pepsin\nsecreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or\nthree liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.\nChyme released to duodenum.\nSmall intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver\nPancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to\nneutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuff to break down\nlipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)\nLiver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in\nduodenum, emulsifies fats.\nEmulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action\nof lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.\nFatty acids go to lymphatic system\nAppendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:\nherbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.\nRumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose\nresistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,\nprotists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down\ncellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow\nswallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).\n148 Subphylum Vertebrata\nCoprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of\nthe cecum.\n149  30 Circulatory system\nCirculatory system functions\n1. Transportation\na. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate\nof\ndiffusion\nb. Nutrition:<br>\nc. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>\n2. Regulation\na. Transport hormones<br>\nb. Regulate body temperature<br>\nc. Protection<br>\ni. Blood clotting<br>\nii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)\nVasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood\nto surface of body, sweating may accompany\nCountercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in fins to conserve heat in cold water.\nVeins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling\nout from body to fin, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.\nBlood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,\nand platelets).\nPlasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.\nPlasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic\nintegrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit\nRed blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In\nmammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.\nNo self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.\nAbout 7-8 micrometers in diameter.\n151 Circulatory system\nHematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans\non average. 48% for men and 38% for women.\nWhite blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-\nmonly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,\nneutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.\nPlatelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In\nnon-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood\nvessels, form clots. Bud off special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8\nday life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.\nArteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to\ncapillaries.\nVeins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.\nStructureofarteriesandveins, listedfrominside(lumen)out: 1. epithelium(endothelium),\n2. elastic connective tissue fibers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries\nhave thicker elastic layer than do veins.\nCapillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood\ncells pass through single file. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is\ngreater than that of supplying arteries.\nBlood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower\nin capillaries and arteries.\nOsmotic pressure draws interstitial fluid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.\nOne-way valvesmeanthatbloodcanflowonlyoneway, workswithresidualbloodpressure\nand compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing\nalso helps move blood.\nLymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up\ninterstitial fluid not taken up by venules.\nLymphatic structures:\n1. lymphatic capillaries\n2. lymphatic vesicles\n3. lymph nodes\n4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)\nLymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in\nveins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and\nsalamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the\nheart via single large thoracic duct.\n152 Subphylum Vertebrata\nAs lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.\nHeart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form\ntwo separate circulations\n1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and\n2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.\nEverything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).\nDiagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.\nPattern of blood flow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)\nentersrightatrium, contractiontheredeliversbloodtorightventriclethroughatricuspid\nvalve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood\nthrough semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in\npulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood\nto left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.\nBoth atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system\nvs. just lungs).\nSystole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed\nTiming of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-\nlunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) fill with blood coming from pulmonary\nand systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the\nventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,\nthen ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves\nshut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries\nand from the right ventricle into the aorta.\nControl for this action doesn\u2019t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called\nmyogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have\nneurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the\ncardiac ganglion.\nThe rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.\nThis is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart\nthat had one more chamber than modern hearts.\nHow the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread\nthrough atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular\nnode. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate\nheart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread\nthrough heart.\nMedulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of\nthe brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the\nbody). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord,usesnorepinephrine\nto signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus\n153 Circulatory system\nnerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.\n(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)\nDominant effect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about\n25 bpm.\n154 31 Respiratory system\nIn humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system\ninclude airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.\nOtheranimals,suchasinsects,haverespiratorysystemswithverysimpleanatomicalfeatures,\nand in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.\nPlants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite\nto that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such\nas holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.\nIn mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the\nabdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)\nthoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.\nRespiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into\nalveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human\nlungs. Total surface area large. Gas diffuses micrometer, very tiny distance.\nNervous System\nComposed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated\nresponse to the environment.\nBasic unit of the nervous system is the neuron1, a highly specialized cell that uses both\nelectrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons \"listen\" to sensory organs or\nother neurons, and can simultaneously \"hear\" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.\nLikewise, a neuron can \"talk\" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle\ncells or glands.\nNeurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play\na supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important\nparticipants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,\nand a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann\ncells that provide a myelin sheath.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron\n155 Respiratory system\n31.1 Neuron structure\nFigure 9 Neuron\n\u2022 Dendrite will receive information from other axons\n\u2022 Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and\nnucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.\n\u2022 Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.\n\u2022 Axon is surrounded by myelin.\n\u2022 Contains nodes of Ranvier\nTypes of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.\nAction potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results\nin a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ influx via\nchannels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening\nK+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.\nSynapses\nNeurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-\ntransmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters\ninclude acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.\nExample : Neuromuscular synapses\n156 Central nervous system\nCircuits / Nuclei / Ganglia\n31.2 Central nervous system\nCentral nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.\nBrain There are four lobes of the brain.\n\u2022 Frontal lobe - decision making\n\u2022 Parietal lobe\n\u2022 Temporal lobe\n\u2022 Occipital lobe - vision\nThe areas of the brain are also dedicated to different functions.\n\u2022 Precentral gyrus\n\u2022 Postcentral gyrus\nProtection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and\nthe dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).\nCSF helps to float the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal\ncord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are\nfour ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.\n31.3 Peripheral nervous system\nThe peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous\nsystem and the autonomic nervous system.\nANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and\nsympathetic.\nThe sympathetic nervous system is the \"fight or flight\" or fright response and results in an\nincreased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There\nis also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the\nfirst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.\nDrugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an effect on the CNS. Drugs act\nby affecting the neuron and how likely it is to fire an action potential.\nStroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood flow.\n157  32 Sensory systems\nCategorized by\n1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and\n2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and\nskin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-\nperature receptors).\nTransduction of sensory input into signal. Means to \u201ccarry across\u201d,signal transduced, or\ncarried, from environment into nervous signal.\nThree sensory processes we cover\n1. taste and smell (chemoreception)\n2. gravity and movement\n3. light\n32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)\nFound in mammal nose and mouth, fly feet, fish bodies, moth antennae.\nPapilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.\nSome act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other \u201ctaste\u201d sensations really\nsmell.\nSmell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial\nsurface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. \u201cFried\nonions\u201d odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.\nVery sensitive, habituates rapidly (don\u2019t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has\nrelatively unfiltered root to higher brain centers.\nSnakes more chemosensory focused than us.\n32.2 Response to gravity and movement\nRegistered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles\nto each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells\n159 Sensory systems\ndeformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity\nand movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.\nCochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.\nSound enters through auditory canal, vibrates tympanic membrane,moving three bones\nof middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.\nCochlea has three fluid filled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air\ngo to vibration in organ of Corti; fluid tickles hair cells, which register the movement\nalong basilar membrane in cochlea. Different sound frequencies move different portions\nof basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more\nthan 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).\nTransduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.\n32.3 Vision\nLight enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.\nSclera: hardened part behind retina.\nOptic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has\nno receptors.\nTwo types of photoreceptors\n1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.\n2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.\nFovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.\nTransduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule\ncalled photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod\nphotopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This\nmolecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron\nleading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika\nEach of the three photopsins has a different peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and\nchanges isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength\nrange. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X\nchromosome, therefore more common in men than women.\n32.4 Homeostasis\nIs a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Defined as dynamic con-\nstancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside\nan organism usually involving feedback regulation.\n160 Osmotic environments and regulations\nHomeostasis is maintained in face of\n1. a varying external environment, or\n2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).\nDeals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.\nOccurs through negative feedback loops.\nVarious forms: simple thermostat in house turns off heater when above a certain temperature\nand on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,\neffector and response.\nMore efficient control has two sensors and two effectors. Can be antagonistic to each\nother, such as, one cools, the other heats.\nPrecise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little\nbit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,\nshivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,\nbehavioral changes (get out of sun).\nPositive feedback loop: effector increases deviation from set point. Amplifies reaction.\nLike blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must\nexist at some point for control.\n32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations\n1. Marine invertebrates\na) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set\ninternal environment same as environment, no net flow of ions) in a stenohaline\n(narrow non-changing salt level) environment\nb) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels fluctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-\nconfomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)\nenvironment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment\nget real low).\n2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do\nliving organisms so water tends to flow in and solutes out.\na) Freshwater fish (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)\nb) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater fish but with different\nstructures\nc) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin\n3. Marine fishes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does\nthe organism so water tends to flow out and ions in.\na) Bony fishes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut\nwall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated\nurine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO\n4\nb) cartilaginous fishes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide\nto increase its osmolality to that of seawater\n161 Sensory systems\n4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and\nregulation of salt levels.\na) water loss adaptations\nb) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes\nHypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby fluid\nHyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby fluid\nIsoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby fluid\nGlomerulus: reduces volume of kidney\nFish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.\nTerrestrial animal water sources:\n1. drinking\n2. moist foods\n3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their\nwater from metabolism.)\nSecretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be\nremoved in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:\n1. ammonia (aquatic life)\n2. urea (mammals)\n3. uric acid (birds)\nAmmonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony fishes.\nUrea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.\nMust be released in solution, water cost.\nUric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,\nmore costly side groups lost than the others.\nMammalian kidney: Structure: fist-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from\naorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a\nday.\nNephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.\nBowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary filter, the glomerulus.\nProximal convoluted tubule: receives stuff from Bowmans capsule.\nLoop of Henle: descends and ascends.\n162 Osmotic environments and regulations\nVasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.\nGlomerulus: main filter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule\nKidney properties and processes important to its function\n1. Active transport of solutes from one fluid to another against a concentration gradient,\nNa+ actively transported out of filtrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into\nthe interstitial fluid\n2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one fluid to another(down a concen-\ntration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into\ninterstitial fluid.\n3. Differential permeability of cells in different regions of the nephron to movement\nof water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is\npermeable to water\n4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases\npermeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of filtrate and thus\nmore concentrated urine.\n5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial fluid of the kidney, from the\ncortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism\n163  33 Additional material\n\u2022 Francis Crick1 chemist and molecular biologist, discovered structure of DNA molecule\n\u2022 Charles Darwin2 the father of the science of evolutionary biology\n\u2022 Richard Dawkins3 zoologist and biology populariser\n\u2022 Stephen Jay Gould4 paleontologist and science populariser\n\u2022 J.B.S.
