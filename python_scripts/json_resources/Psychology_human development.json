You have been on a fascinating developmental journey your whole\nlife long, and now you are going to have the opportunity to learn about the study of human development from birth\nto death. This course provides a bird\u2019s eye view of major milestones and developmental tasks during each age period,\nstarting at conception and ending with old age. As you discover age periods that you would like to learn more about, we\ninvite you take any of the 400-level series of developmental courses covering specific developmental periods in more\ndepth: Infancy, Early Childhood Development, Child Psychology, Adolescent Development, and Adult Development and\nAging.\nWe are delighted to share this class with you. To get started, we\u2019d like to give you an overview of how the course is put\ntogether. It is organized into two broad learning goals. Within each, we focus on three main learning objectives. Let\u2019s\nlook at them all together first, and then go through each one in more detail, to see how the course is structured to meet\nthose broad goals and more specific objectives.\nCore Curriculum: Learn Everything\n1.

Fascinating developmental journey. The course covers a defined content core, focused on major developmental\nmilestones from birth to death. The learning of this core content is motivated by the driving question of the class,\nnamely, \u201cHow can we promote optimal human development?\u201d and the demonstrated importance of this question\nto students in the class, including:\na. the careers toward which you are working (e.g., teaching, social work, nursing, coaching) in which you will be\nshaping others\u2019 development as part of your profession,\nb. key social roles in your current and future personal lives (as parents, spouses, voters, and citizens) in which\nyou will be influencing the development of your children, nieces, nephews, spouses, and so on, and\nc. as contributors to your own development through your actions and decisions about college, vocations,\nromantic partners, hobbies, substance use, etc.\nThis driving question creates a \u201cneed to know\u201d situation about the nature of optimal development and how to\npromote it, which are the central components of the class content. Student learning is aided by definitions of\n\u201coptimal development\u201d as involving the whole person in realizing their full human potential, and organizing the\nlifespan according to \u201cdevelopmental tasks.\u201d Key insights about how to promote optimal development are based\non the use of cumulative research findings and \u201cevidence-based practices\u201d to figure out how to identify and\ncreate \u201cperson-centered\u201d contexts and interactions (\u201cchild-centered\u201d parenting or \u201cstudent-centered\u201d teaching)\nacross the lifespan.\n2. The role of context and culture. A core principle guiding the class is that development takes place in multi-level\nchanging societal and historical contexts. We decided to focus on two higher-order contexts throughout the\nclass\u2013 poverty and racism\u2014 as two important societal conditions that exert downward pressure on optimal human\ndevelopment. This thread is woven throughout the textbook and revisited again and again in class. We provide\nsupplementary readings, including Gary Evan\u2019s The Environment of Childhood Poverty and the American Academy\nof Pediatrics article on The Impact of Racism on Child and Adolescent Health.\nThe impact of poverty and racism is examined at each developmental level. We explore their effects on parenting\nand child maltreatment, on schools and schooling, on adolescent identity and risky behavior, on aging and life\nexpectancy. To offset the grim realities of their potentially deleterious effects, we also focus on their antidotes:\nsocietal changes, educational programs, and interventions that have been demonstrated to prevent, ameliorate,\nor buffer the consequences of poverty and racism on development.\n3. Centrality of research methods. It is easy for students to undervalue research methods, seeing them as some\ntechnical information that is not really relevant to them. So the arc on research methods is motivated by the idea of\n\u201cevidence-based practices,\u201d an idea which is coming or has already arrived in all professions based on the social\nsciences, such as teaching, nursing, and social work, toward which most of the students in the class are headed.\nYou are continually encouraged to ask \u201cHow do we know what we know?\u201d and we wrote a new chapter on research\nmethods for the OER textbook organized around that question. We also constructed a series of \u201cdetail detective\u201d\nin-class exercises dispersed throughout the course, in which students detect conceptual and methodological flaws\nin research design and interpretation. The instructor presents the essentials of a real study and its real (and\nwrong) interpretation in the literature. Students discuss the problems in small groups and articulate the\nproblematic aspects of the designs or interpretations and suggest future studies to correct or investigate these\nalternatives.\nThe learning of core content is supported by the OER textbook and a set of supplemental readings selected by the team.\nFor each class period, we have created PowerPoint slides, lecture segments, targeted video clips, and in-class individual\nand group activities to stimulate \u201cheads-on\u201d engagement and provide feedback about attendance and learning to the\n2 | Introduction instructor. Core content learning is supported by a study guide and in-class review sessions; and is assessed by two\ncarefully calibrated multiple-choice exams. Core content learning is rounded out by brief reflective assignments:\n\u2022 Developmental Journal. An ongoing weekly journal entry that allows you to anchor your understanding of course\nmaterial by writing relatively informal short responses about the ways that key concepts and core ideas presented in\nclass or readings connect to your own life. By reflecting, exploring, applying, and integrating course material, you\ncan scaffold your own learning about the concepts and ideas most important to you.\n\u2022 For example, students use class concepts to describe their own developmental path through the past and present,\nand into the future, including examples of how they might use some of their knowledge about developmental\nstages to interpret the challenges of particular times of their lives.\n\u2022 This assignment is scaffolded by offering example entries and providing students carefully developed rubrics that\ncommunicate what will be important to include.\nHidden Curriculum: Question Everything\nThe second broad goal of the class takes students \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d of conventional science, practice, and societal\nfunctioning to surface and critique underlying assumptions about humans and how they develop. These assumptions,\nof which we are often unaware or which are intentionally hidden from us, nevertheless have a profound impact on\ndevelopmental research and on the contexts (personal, professional, and societal) that influence development during\nevery age period.\nThis broad goal is also divided into three learning objectives.\n1. Surface developmental meta-theories. This strand focuses on critical thinking by providing a learning arc on\ndevelopmental meta-theories, which refer to the implicit assumptions we all hold about the nature of human\ndevelopment (e.g., intrinsically good, inherently bad, or blank slate), how development proceeds (e.g., continuously\nor in qualitatively different stages), and where development comes from (e.g., nature versus nurture). These\ninclude scientific perspectives which dominate the field at a particular historical moment (e.g., behaviorism or\nneuroscience) as well as stereotypes about development and aging which dominate a society (e.g., \u201cyou can\u2019t teach\nan old dog new tricks\u201d) or a practice or profession (e.g., assumptions in teaching that motivation comes from\nexternal sources).\n2. Reinvent a better world. Throughout the class, students are encouraged to use knowledge about human\ndevelopment as a platform to reimagine a world that better supports development all across the lifespan. The class\nfocuses especially on status hierarchies created by all societies that rank order subgroups of people according to\ntheir inherent worth. These hierarchies give people differential access to opportunities, resources, and power, and\nso create serious problems for people at the bottom. Hierarchies produce objective living conditions that are\ndevelopmentally hazardous to children and families (and youth, adults, and the elderly), sponsor entrenched myths\nabout the inferiority of targeted subgroups, and defend cover stories that blame them for their situation and deny\ntheir everyday experiences of discrimination and prejudice. In readings and class sessions, we repeatedly explore\nhow status hierarchies create risk factors for healthy development and brainstorm alternative societal structures\nthat would be more supportive.\n3. Revolutionize developmental science. A strength of science as a way of knowing is its openness to improvement,\nand throughout this class we highlight critiques of developmental science\u2013 both past and present. The\nidentification of blind spots, problems, and limitations encourages students (as budding developmentalists) to see\nthemselves as informed consumers of social science research, and to remain skeptical and open to critical\nperspectives and alternative sources of knowledge.\nThe broad goal of \u201cquestioning everything\u201d is supported by multiple sections in the textbook, such as an introductory\nIntroduction | 3 chapter that explicitly explains the idea of meta-theories, and a research methods chapter that identifies multiple\nlimitations of developmental science. Students read additional original material on these topics, and this textbook\nincludes sections at the end of every chapter that provide a range of optional additional readings and videos that follow\nup on critiques and alternative perspectives. Class sessions include developmentally-graded practice in identifying\nand critiquing assumptions underlying developmental theories, research methodologies, professional practices, and\nstudents\u2019 own thinking.\nThe class views human development as an applied science and highlights the application of developmental research to\nsolving real world problems. This strand is supported by in-class segments about how to create contexts that support\nthe development of the people who inhabit them (e.g., families, schools, workplaces, and so on), including multiple\nexamples drawn from intervention efforts designed to improve these contexts, such as early childhood programs or\ncognitive training for the elderly. This learning arc is supported by a major class project in which groups of students\nreinvent a specific developmental context so it better fosters human development.\n\u2022 Reimagining Developmental Contexts. This project gives you the opportunity to take the social context of your\nchoice (e.g., preschool, hospital, foster care) and imagine how it can be improved so that it more successfully\nsupports the development of its inhabitants. Students pick a target context that is important to them personally,\nand work together with other students who are also interested in that context.\n\u2022 Together you identify problems and brainstorm solutions using meta-theories, class concepts, information about\ncommunity organizations, and your imaginations. Students are supported through a series of scaffolded steps,\nincluding discussion posts, outlines, and rough drafts. You receive feedback about your ideas from the members of\ntheir group and the instructor, and then individually write a persuasive essay about how you would re-make that\ncontext so it better supports healthy development. This paper ends with students describing one next step they\ncould take to use their knowledge about developmentally-supportive contexts to foster development for\nthemselves and/or others, whether in career, family, or elsewhere.\nThe Human Development Teaching and Learning Group\nHuman Development is a core course in Psychology, and one of the largest enrolling courses at Portland State\nUniversity, serving over 1000 students a year. It is an important course for Psychology majors and a gateway to upper\ndivision developmental courses on specific age periods. It is also a university studies cluster course, a popular elective,\nand a requirement for many other majors and minors, including education, nursing, social work, and child and family\nstudies.\nThe size and reach of Human Development make it an important target for high quality teaching and learning. We are\nproud of the high student ratings this course receives (5.2 to 5.7 on a 6-point scale). And building on that foundation, we\ndecided about a decade ago to create a \u201cmaster class\u201d for Human Development, that is, a course that incorporates best\npractices from master teachers, past and present. In that spirit, in 2011, we formed the Human Development Teaching\nand Learning Group. The team was organized around 3 master teachers with decades of experience teaching the course,\nand 2 new graduate instructors and 6 doctoral teaching assistants.\nUsing their combined expertise covering all periods of development, the team hammered out common learning\nobjectives, course content, a textbook and required readings, learning activities, assignments, exam questions, and so\non. Because the course is regularly taught by faculty and doctoral students from the department\u2019s concentration in\nDevelopmental Science and Education, decisions were also informed by motivational research, social science pedagogy,\nand current thinking about the best ways to teach large classes. The team worked together for 18 months to create the\ncourse and refine it on 11 sections of Human Development, involving over 1200 students. Four years later, in the spring\nof 2015, the team conducted a major overhaul, revising the complexity of the written assignments, and reworking the\nexam questions.\n4 | Introduction In summer 2020, the Human Development Teaching and Learning Group came together again. This time the team\nincluded 4 experienced instructors and 6 doctoral students who had TA-ed the class multiple times. The primary goal\nwas to convert the class away from a standard textbook to the Open Educational Resources you are now reading. At the\nsame time, we decided to reinvent core assignments, and added a strong through line on racism and social justice. Over\nthe decade since Human Development was converted to a master class, it has benefited from over a hundred years of\ncombined teaching experience and been modified based on feedback from thousands of students who have taken the\nclass.\nOngoing improvements. This is a living class that is passed on to next generations of instructors who benefit from the\nwork that has gone before, and also add to and improve the class as they teach it. Teachers are in touch with each other\nvia e-mail or in person over the quarter, and we act as resources for each other when questions or problems arise. We\nregularly meet to discuss changes and improvements to the class. The project is ongoing, and provides a rich context\nfor the development of instructors, teaching assistants, and the class itself. We actively encourage students to join this\nproject by providing feedback about what is working well in the course and suggestions for how it can be improved\u2013\nright now and in future iterations.\nMembers of the Human Development Teaching and Learning Group. The team members who created the original\nmaster class include: previous faculty instructors, Cathleen Smith and Gabriella Martorell; faculty team leader, Ellen\nSkinner; Adjunct Faculty, Glen Richardson and Shannon Myrick; Graduate Instructors, Cynthia Taylor, Jennifer Pitzer;\nGraduate teaching assistants, Heather Brule, Cailin Currie, Rita Yelverton, Jeff Beers, Jessica Harrison, and Justin Vollet.\nThe most recent revision of the course was undertaken by faculty team leader, Ellen Skinner; adjunct faculty Cynthia\nTaylor, Heather Brule, and Julia Dancis; and doctoral teaching assistants (and future instructors) Dan Grimes, James\nDelaney, Brandy Brennan, Eli Labinger, Kristen Raine, and Brielle Petit. We also benefited from the contributions of\nJaime Wood and the Office of Academic Innovation at Portland State University, who provided logistical, financial, and\npedagogical support for the conversion to Open Educational Resources.\nThese OER materials were converted to a Pressbook under the direction of Kristen Raine, and with the help of\nHeather Brule and James Delaney.\nIntroduction | 5 UNIT I: META-THEORIES\n6 | Unit I: Meta-theories What is Development?\nHuman Development or Lifespan Development is the scientific study of the ways in which people change, as well as remain\nthe same, from conception to death. You will discover that the field, known more broadly as developmental science,\nexamines changes and stability across multiple domains of psychological and social functioning. These include physical\nand neurophysiological processes, cognition, language, emotion, personality, moral, and psychosocial development,\nincluding our relationships with others.\nOriginally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include\nadolescence and more recently, aging and the entire life span. Previously, the\nmessage was once you are 25, your development is essentially completed. Our\nacademic knowledge of the lifespan has changed, and although there is still less\nresearch on adulthood than on childhood, adulthood is gaining increasing\nattention. This is particularly true now that the large cohort known as the \u201cbaby\nboomers\u201d are beginning to enter late adulthood. The assumption that early\nchildhood experiences dictate our future is also being called into question.\nInstead, we have come to appreciate that growth and change continues\nthroughout life and experience continues to have an impact on who we are and\nhow we relate to others. We now recognize that adulthood is a dynamic period of\nlife marked by continued cognitive, social, and psychological development.\nYou will also discover that developmental psychologists investigate key questions,\nsuch as whether children are qualitatively different from adults or simply lack the\nexperience that adults draw upon. Other issues they consider include the\nquestion of whether development occurs through the gradual accumulation of\nFigure 1.1\nknowledge or through qualitative shifts from one stage of thinking to another, or\nif children are born with innate knowledge or figure things out through experience, and whether development is driven\nby the social context or something inside each child. From these questions, you may already be thinking that\ndevelopmental psychology is related to other applied fields. You are right. Developmental science informs many applied\nfields, including, educational psychology, developmental psychopathology, and intervention science. It also\ncomplements several other basic research fields in psychology including social psychology, cognitive psychology, and\ncross-cultural psychology. Lastly, it draws from the theories and research of several scientific fields including biology,\nsociology, health care, nutrition, and anthropology.\nLearning Objectives: Lifespan Perspective\n\u2022 Explain the lifespan perspective and its assumptions about development\n\u2022 Differentiate periods of human development\n\u2022 Identify key assumptions and major meta-theories underlying lifespan development\n\u2022 Identify major historical and contemporary theories focusing on lifespan development\nWhat is Development? | 7 Lifespan Perspective\nPaul Baltes identified several underlying principles of the lifespan perspective (Baltes, 1987; Baltes, Lindenberger, &\nStaudinger, 2006).\n1. Development is lifelong. Lifespan theorists believe that development is life-long, and change is apparent across\nthe lifespan. No single age period is more crucial, characterizes, or dominates human development. Consequently,\nthe term lifespan development will be used throughout the textbook.\n2. Development is multidirectional and multidimensional. Lifespan researchers hold that different people follow\ndifferent developmental pathways, and proceed along pathways at different rates. Even within the same person,\ndifferent dimensions or domains of development can change in different ways.\n3. Development includes both gains and losses. Lifespan theorists do not agree with the traditional view of\ndevelopment that childhood is a period characterized by developmental gains, whereas old age is a time of loss.\nInstead, the lifespan approach holds that at every age, we may show gains in some areas of development, while\nshowing losses in other areas. Every change, whether it is finishing high school, getting married, or becoming a\nparent, entails both growth and loss.\n4. Development is characterized by plasticity. Plasticity is about malleability, or our potential to change and to follow\na wide range of developmental pathways. For instance, plasticity is illustrated in the brain\u2019s ability to learn from\nexperience and the many ways it can recover from injury.\n5. Development is embedded in historical and cultural contexts. Lifespan researchers believe that development is\ninfluenced by the many social contexts in which it unfolds. How people develop will depend on their societal and\ncultural contexts, and on the historical period during which their development takes place.\n6. Development is multiply determined. Lifespan theorists argue that development is caused by multiple factors,\nand is always shaped by both biological and environmental factors. In addition, the individual plays an active rile in\nhis or her own development.\n7. Development is multidisciplinary. As mentioned at the start of the chapter, human development is such a vast\ntopic of study that it requires the theories, research methods, and knowledge bases of many academic disciplines.\nContextualism as paradigm. Baltes (1987) identified three specific developmental systems of influence, all of which\ninclude biological and environmental forces.\n\u25e6 Normative age-graded influences: An age-grade is a specific age group, such as toddler, adolescent, or senior.\nHumans experience particular age-graded social experiences (e.g., starting school) and biological changes\n(e.g., puberty).\n\u25e6 Normative history-graded influences: The time period in which you are born (see Table 1.1) shapes your\nexperiences. A cohort is a group of people who are born at roughly the same period in a particular society. These\npeople travel through life often experiencing similar historical changes at similar ages. History-graded\ninfluences include both environmental determinants (e.g., historical changes in the job market) and biological\ndeterminants (e.g., historical changes in life expectancy).\n\u25e6 Non-normative influences: People\u2019s development is also shaped by specific influences that are not organized\nby age or historical time, such as immigration, accidents, or the death of a parent. These can be environmental\n(e.g., parental mental health issues) or biological (e.g., life threatening illness).\n8 | What is Development? Table 1.1. Which generation (cohort) are you?\nGeneration Born between...\nSilent Generation 1928 and 1945\nBaby Boomers 1946 and 1964\nGeneration X 1965 and 1980\nMillenials 1982 and 1996\nGeneration Z 1997 and Present\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nDomains of development. We change across three general domains/dimensions; physical, cognitive, and psychosocial.\nThe physical domain includes changes in height and weight, sensory capabilities, the nervous system, as well as the\npropensity for disease and illness. The cognitive domain encompasses the changes in intelligence, wisdom, perception,\nproblem-solving, memory, and language. The psychosocial domain focuses on changes in emotion, self-perception and\ninterpersonal relationships with families, peers, and friends. All three domains influence each other. It is also important\nto note that a change in one domain may cascade and prompt changes in the other domains. For instance, an infant who\nhas started to crawl or walk will encounter more objects and people, thus fostering developmental change in the child\u2019s\nunderstanding of the physical and social world.\nContextual perspectives, like the lifespan approach, highlight societal contexts that influence our development. An\nimportant societal factor is our social standing, socioeconomic status, or social class. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a\nway to identify families and households based on their shared levels of education, income, and occupation. While there is\ncertainly individual variation, members of a social class tend to share similar privileges, opportunities, lifestyles, patterns\nof consumption, parenting styles, stressors, religious preferences, and other aspects of daily life. All of us born into\na class system are socially located, and we may move up or down depending on a combination of both socially and\nindividually created limits and opportunities.\nFamilies with higher socioeconomic status usually are in occupations (e.g., attorneys, physicians, executives) that not\nonly pay better, but also grant them a certain degree of freedom and control over their job. Having a sense of autonomy\nor control is a key factor in experiencing job satisfaction, personal happiness, and ultimately health and well-being\n(Weitz, 2007). Those families with lower socioeconomic status are typically in occupations that are more routine, more\nheavily supervised, and require less formal education. These occupations are also more subject to job disruptions,\nincluding lay-offs and lower wages.\nPoverty level is an income amount established by the federal government that is based on a set of thresholds that vary by\nfamily size (United States Census Bureau, 2016). If a family\u2019s income is less than the government threshold, that family\nis considered in poverty. Those living at or near poverty level may find it extremely difficult to sustain a household with\nthis amount of income. Poverty is associated with poorer health and a lower life expectancy due to poorer diet, less\nhealthcare, greater stress, working in more dangerous occupations, higher infant mortality rates, poorer prenatal care,\ngreater iron deficiencies, greater difficulty in school, and many other problems. Members of higher income status may\nfear losing that status, but the poor may have greater concerns over losing housing.\nToday we are more aware of the variations in development and the impact that culture and the environment have on\nshaping our lives. Culture is the totality of our shared language, knowledge, material objects, and behavior. It includes\nideas about what is right and wrong, what to strive for, what to eat, how to speak, what is valued, as well as what kinds\nof emotions are called for in certain situations. Culture teaches us how to live in a society and allows us to advance\nbecause each new generation can benefit from the solutions found and passed down from previous generations. Culture\nWhat is Development? | 9 is learned from parents, schools, houses of worship, media, friends and others throughout a lifetime. The kinds of\ntraditions and values that evolve in a particular culture serve to help members function and value their own society.\nWe tend to believe that our own culture\u2019s practices and expectations are the right ones. This belief that our own culture\nis superior is called ethnocentrism and is a normal by-product of growing up in a culture. It becomes a roadblock,\nhowever, when it inhibits understanding of cultural practices from other societies. Cultural relativity is an appreciation\nfor cultural differences and the understanding that cultural practices are best understood from the standpoint of that\nparticular culture.\nCulture is an extremely important context for human development and understanding development requires being able\nto identify which features of development are culturally based. This understanding is somewhat new and still being\nexplored. Much of what developmental theorists have described in the past has been culturally bound and difficult\nto apply to various cultural contexts. The reader should keep this in mind and realize that there is still much that is\nunknown when comparing development across cultures.\nLifespan vs. Life expectancy: At this point you must be wondering what the difference between lifespan and life\nexpectancy is, according to developmentalists. Lifespan, or longevity, refers to the maximum age any member of a species\ncan reach under optimal conditions. For instance, the grey wolf can live up to 20 years in captivity, the bald eagle up to\n50 years, and the Galapagos tortoise over 150 years (Smithsonian National Zoo, 2016). The longest recorded lifespan for\na human was Jean Calment who died in 1994 at the age of 122 years, 5 months, and 14 days (Guinness World Records,\n2016). Life expectancy is the average number of years a person born in a particular time period can typically expect to live\n(Vogt & Johnson, 2016).\nConceptions of Age\nHow old are you? Chances are you would answer that question based on the number of years since your birth, or what\nis called your chronological age. Ever felt older than your chronological age? Some days we might \u201cfeel\u201d like we are\nolder, especially if we are not feeling well, are tired, or are stressed out. We might notice that a peer seems more\nemotionally mature than we are, or that they are physically more capable. So years since birth is not the only way we\ncan conceptualize age.\nBiological age: Another way developmental researchers can think about the concept of age is to examine how quickly\nthe body is aging, this is your biological age. Several factors determine the rate at which our body ages. Our nutrition,\nlevel of physical activity, sleeping habits, smoking, alcohol consumption, how we mentally handle stress, and the genetic\nhistory of our ancestors, to name but a few.\nPsychological age: Our psychologically adaptive capacity compared to others of our chronological age is our psychological\nage. This includes our cognitive capacity along with our emotional beliefs about how old we are. An individual who has\ncognitive impairments might be 20 years of age, yet has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old. A 70- year-old might be\ntravelling to new countries, taking courses at college, or starting a new business. Compared to others of our age group,\nwe may be more or less active and excited to meet new challenges. Remember you are as young or old as you feel.\nSocial age: Our social age is based on the social norms of our culture and the expectations our culture has for people of our\nage group. Our culture often reminds us whether we are \u201con target\u201d or \u201coff target\u201d for reaching certain social milestones,\nsuch as completing our education, moving away from home, having children, or retiring from work. However, there have\nbeen arguments that social age is becoming less relevant in the 21st century (Neugarten, 1979; 1996). If you look around\nat your fellow students at college you might notice more people who are older than traditional aged college students,\nthose 18 to 25. Similarly, the age at which people are moving away from the home of their parents, starting their careers,\ngetting married or having children, or even whether they get married or have children at all, is changing.\nThose who study lifespan development recognize that chronological age does not completely capture a person\u2019s age.\n10 | What is Development? Our age profile is much more complex than this. A person may be physically more competent than others in their age\ngroup, while being psychologically immature. So, how old are you?\nTable 1.2 Age Periods of Development\nAge Period Description\nStarts at conceptions, continues through implantation in the uterine wall by the embryo, and ends at\nPrenatal\nbirth.\nInfancy and Toddlerhood Starts at birth and continues to two years of age.\nEarly Childhood Starts at two years of age until six years of age.\nMiddle and Late\nStarts at six years of age and continues until the onset of puberty.\nChildhood\nAdolescence Starts at the onset of puberty until 18\nEmerging Adulthood Starts at 18 until 25.\nEarly Adulthood Starts at 25 until 40-45.\nLate Adulthood Starts at 65 onward.\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nTable 1.2 shows the developmental periods that will be explored in this book, starting with prenatal development and\ncontinuing thought late adulthood to death. Both childhood and adulthood are divided into multiple developmental\nperiods. So, while both an 8-month old and an 8-year-old are considered children, they have very different motor\nabilities, social relationships, and cognitive skills. Their nutritional needs are different and their primary psychological\nconcerns are also distinctive. The same is true of an 18-year-old and an 80-year-old, even though both are considered\nadults.\nPrenatal Development: Conception occurs and development begins. All of the major structures of the body are forming,\nand the health of the mother is of primary concern. Understanding nutrition, teratogens, or environmental factors that\ncan lead to birth defects, and labor and delivery are primary concerns.\nInfancy and Toddlerhood: The first two years of life are ones of\ndramatic growth and change. A newborn, with a keen sense of\nhearing but very poor vision, is transformed into a walking,\ntalking toddler within a relatively short period of time.\nCaregivers are also transformed from someone who manages\nfeeding and sleep schedules to a constantly moving guide and\nsafety inspector for a mobile, energetic child.\nEarly Childhood: This period is also referred to as the preschool\nyears and consists of the years that follow toddlerhood and\nprecede formal schooling. As a two to six-year-old, the child is\nFigure 1.2 busy learning language, gaining a sense of self and greater\nindependence, and beginning to understand the workings of\nthe physical world.\nMiddle and Late Childhood: The ages of six to the onset of puberty comprise middle and late childhood, and much of\nwhat children experience at this age is connected to their involvement in the early grades of school. Now the world\nWhat is Development? | 11 becomes one of learning and testing new academic skills, and assessing one\u2019s abilities and accomplishments by making\ncomparisons between self and others.\nAdolescence: Adolescence is a period of dramatic physical change marked by an overall growth spurt and sexual\nmaturation, known as puberty. It is also a time of cognitive change as the adolescent begins to think of new possibilities\nand to consider abstract concepts such as love, fear, and freedom. At the same time, adolescents have a sense of\ninvincibility that puts them at greater risk of accidents or contracting sexually transmitted infections that can have\nlifelong consequences.\nEmerging Adulthood: The period of emerging adulthood is a transitional time between the end of adolescence and\nbefore individuals acquire all the benchmarks of adulthood. Continued identity exploration and preparation for full\nindependence from parents are negotiated. Although at one\u2019s physiological peak, emerging adults are most at risk for\ninvolvement in violent crimes and substance abuse.\nEarly Adulthood: The twenties and thirties are identified as early adulthood. Intimate relationships, establishing families\n(of all shapes and sizes), and work are primary concerns at this stage of life. For adults with children, developmental\nchanges can become organized around the family life cycle.\nMiddle Adulthood: The forties through the mid-sixties are referred\nto as middle adulthood. This is a period in which aging becomes more\nnoticeable and when many people are at their peak of productivity in\nlove and work. At this age, some people are negotiating adolescent\nchildren and aging parents at the same time.\nLate Adulthood: Late adulthood is sometimes subdivided into two\ncategories: The young-old who are from 65-84 years and the oldest-\nold who are 85 years and older. One of the primary differences\nbetween these groups is that the young-old are still relatively\nhealthy, productive, active, and the majority continue to live\nindependently. With both age groups the risks of diseases such as\narteriosclerosis, cancer, and cerebral vascular disease increase\nsubstantially.\nMeta-theories of Human Development Figure 1.3\nThe study of development is guided by the assumptions researchers hold about the nature of humans and their\ndevelopment. These assumptions are called meta-theories. \u201cMeta\u201d means \u201cabove\u201d or \u201cbeyond,\u201d like \u201cmeta-physics.\u201d\nOther terms used to describe meta-theories are \u201cworld views,\u201d \u201ccosmologies,\u201d \u201cperspectives,\u201d or \u201cparadigms,\u201d as in\n\u201cparadigm shifts.\u201d Explicit discussions of meta-theories are found most often in philosophy.\nWhat are meta-theories of human development?\nMeta-theories (or world views or paradigms) of human development are sets of assumptions people hold about the nature\nof humans and the meaning of development\u2014 what it looks like, how it happens, what causes it. These assumptions are\nimportant because everyone has them, including researchers, but they are often implicit, meaning we are not always\nconsciously aware of them. In the study of development, such assumptions influence everything about how research is\nconducted: the questions we ask, the measures and methods that are used, and the interpretation of data. For example,\nif researchers assume that development ends at 18, they do not look for developmental changes after that age. Or, if\n12 | What is Development? researchers assume that aging is a process of decline, then they never look for characteristics that might improve as\npeople get older.\nAll researchers have meta-theories, since assumptions are baked into the theories and methodologies they use.\nBut researchers are often unaware of them, and so these assumptions are rarely acknowledged. It is important to note\nthat meta-theories are not just cold cognitions. They are often deeply held convictions that researchers will fiercely\ndefend. Typically researchers think that their assumptions are self-evident truths. They are often convinced that their\nassumptions are right and everyone else\u2019s are wrong.\nResearchers holding different meta-theories can have difficulty communicating with each other. Since they are asking\ndifferent questions and using different truth criteria for research, they often argue past each other or misunderstand\neach other. One group of researchers will offer what they consider to be irrefutable proof of their ideas, which other\nresearchers then dismiss as irrelevant. Discrepancies, inconsistencies, arguments, and furor often characterize an area\nof study in which researchers from multiple meta-theories are working.\nWhat kinds of assumptions guide the study of human development?\nWe consider six key assumptions. You may have heard of many of them, since they are perennial issues in the study of\ndevelopment. They include:\n1. Assumptions about human nature: whether people are born as blank slates (tabula rasa) or whether people are\ninherently good or inherently bad.\n2. Assumptions about the causes of development: whether development is determined by nature (genes, biology) or\ndetermined by nurture (environment, learning).\n3. Assumptions about the role of the individual in his or her own development: whether people are passive\nparticipants, reacting to external forces or whether they are active in choosing and shaping their own\ndevelopment.\n4. Assumptions about stability vs. change: whether traits, characteristics, and experiences early in life have\npermanent effects or whether people are malleable and open to change throughout life.\n5. Assumptions about continuity vs. discontinuity: whether development involves quantitative incremental change or\nqualitative shifts.\n6. Assumptions about universality vs. context specificity: whether development follows a universal pathway or\ndepends more on specific experiences and environmental contexts.\nNature of humans. What I the nature of humans? These assumptions refer to beliefs about the underlying qualities\nof our species\u2013 whether humans are born as blank slates (tabula rasa) or whether we all bring intrinsic human\ncharacteristics with us into the world. For example, these different assumptions are readily apparent in alternative\nconceptualizations of motivation\u2014some theories assume that motives and motivation are all acquired, whereas others\nassume that all humans come with intrinsic motivations.\nNature and Nurture: Why are you the way you are? As you consider some of your features (height, weight, personality,\nbeing diabetic, etc.), ask yourself whether these features are a result of heredity or environmental factors, or both.\nChances are, you can see the ways in which both heredity and environmental factors (such as lifestyle, diet, and so\non) have contributed to these features. For decades, scholars have carried on the \u201cnature/nurture\u201d debate. For any\nparticular feature, those on the side of nature would argue that heredity plays the most important role in bringing about\nthat feature. Those on the side of nurture would argue that one\u2019s environment is most significant in shaping the way\nwe are. This debate continues in all aspects of human development, and most scholars agree that there is a constant\nWhat is Development? | 13 interplay between the two forces. It is difficult to isolate the root of any single behavior as a result solely of nature or\nnurture.\nActive versus Passive: How much do you play a role in your own developmental path? Are you at the whim of your\ngenetic inheritance or the environment that surrounds you? Some theorists see humans as playing a much more active\nrole in their own development. Piaget, for instance believed that children actively explore their world and construct\nnew ways of thinking to explain the things they experience. In contrast, many behaviorists view humans as being more\npassive in the developmental process.\nStability versus Change: How similar are you to how you were as a child? Were you always as out-going or reserved\nas you are now? Some theorists argue that the personality traits of adults are rooted in the behavioral and emotional\ntendencies of the infant and young child. Others disagree, and believe that these initial tendencies are modified by social\nand cultural forces over time.\nContinuity versus Discontinuity: Is human development best\ncharacterized as a slow, gradual process, or is it best viewed as\none of more abrupt change? The answer to that question often\ndepends on which developmental theorist you ask and what\ntopic is being studied. The theories of Freud, Erikson, Piaget,\nand Kohlberg are called stage theories. Stage theories or\ndiscontinuous development assume that developmental change\noccurs in distinct stages that are qualitatively different from each\nFigure 1.4. The tree represents continuous development while\nthe ladybug represents discontinuous development other, and that unfold in a set, universal sequence. At each stage\nof development, children and adults have different qualities and\ncharacteristics. Thus, stage theorists assume development is discontinuous. Others, such as the behaviorists, Vygotsky,\nand information processing theorists, assume development is a more slow and gradual process known as continuous\ndevelopment. For instance, they would see the adult as not possessing new skills, but as using more advanced skills that\nwere already present in some form in the child. Brain development and environmental experiences contribute to the\nacquisition of more developed skills.\nUniversal vs. context specific. A final assumption focuses on whether whether pathways of development are presumed\nto be (1) normative and universal, meaning that all people pass through them in the same sequence, or (2) differential\nand specific, meaning that a variety of different patterns and pathways of developmental change are possible depending\non the individual and the context. Some theorists, like Piaget or Erickson, assume that everyone progresses through the\nsame stages of cognitive development in the same order, or that everyone negotiates the same set of developmental\ntasks at about the same ages. Other theorists, who endorse lifespan or ecological systems approaches, believe that\ndevelopment can take on a wide variety of patterns and pathways, depending on the specific cultural, historical, and\nsocietal under which it unfolds.\nWhat are the guiding meta-theories in human development?\nThese six basic assumptions are clustered into \u201cpackages\u201d that go together. Clusters are organized around metaphors,\nwhich are at the root of meta-theories of humans and their development. We consider four meta-theories, each with\nits own metaphor: (1) humans as seeds, as depicted by Maturational meta-theories; (2) humans as machines, as depicted\nin Mechanistic meta-theories (3) humans as butterflies, as depicted in Organismic meta-theories; and (4) humans as\nparticipants in a tennis game, conversation, or dance, as depicted by Contextualist meta-theories. For an overview of\nthese guiding meta-theories, see this chart [pdf].\n1. Maturational meta-theory: Maturational meta-theories can be understood using the plant as a metaphor. It is as if\nhumans develop the same way as plants. The important thing to study is people\u2019s \u201cseeds,\u201d that is, their genetic\n14 | What is Development? make-up. People are assumed to be passive, the product of their genes. The environment can provide support and\nnutrition (rain, sun, and soil), but can\u2019t change a person\u2019s nature (poppy seeds will always produce poppies). The\nrole of the person is to be reactive\u2014to their genes. The course of development will be continuous or discontinuous\ndepending on the genetic program, although acorns always grow into oak trees.\n2. Mechanistic meta-theory: Mechanistic meta-theories can be understood using the machine as a metaphor. It is as\nif humans change the same way as machines. People are assumed to be made up of pieces that can be studied\napart from the rest of them. They are passive, with the energy coming from outside (like gasoline for a car).\nDevelopment is continuous and people do not develop into something else (a car stays a car). The person can only\nreact to the environment that is controlling them (like a car responding to the gas pedal or the brake). All causes\nfor development come from the outside, from environmental forces.\n3. Organismic meta-theory: Organismic meta-theories can be understood using the butterfly as a metaphor. It is as\nif humans develop the same way as butterflies. People are assumed to be made up of structured wholes. Their\nnature is to be curious, interested, and open to growth. They are active and develop through discontinuous\nqualitatively different stages (like the caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterfly). People construct their own next steps in\ndevelopment based on the affordances and opportunities provided by the environment. Development is caused by\nimbalances that lead to structural reorganizations. Development is progressive (gets better) and only goes in one\ndirection (from caterpillar toward butterfly) and not the reverse.\n4. Contextual meta-theory: Contextual meta-theories can be understood using the tennis game (or dance) as a\nmetaphor. It is as if humans\u2019 development is like a game of tennis or a dance. The important thing to study is the\nback and forth between the person and his or her context, both of which are assumed to be proactive and acting\non their own agendas. Development can be continuous or discontinuous depending on how the game is played.\nBoth person and environment are active partners in the system, which can lead to transformations in both.\nWhat are examples of theories that fall within each meta-theory?\nNested within each higher-order meta-theory are sets of lower-level approaches or theories called \u201cfamilies\u201d of\nperspectives or theories to denote that they share common properties, based on their similarity to the root metaphors\nand characteristics of the guiding meta-theories. This table contains several examples of \u201cbig\u201d theories of development\nand provides an analysis of their defining features according to the meta-theoretical assumptions we have been\ndiscussing [pdf]. Based on this analysis, we indicate the higher-order family to which we think each big theory or\napproach belongs.\nAlthough maturational meta-theories were prevalent in the beginning of the 20th century, their popularity has waxed\nand waned since then, and they have taken on many different forms. These include some formulations of behavioral\ngenetics, sociobiology, evolutionary, ethological, neuroscience, temperament, and personality theories. Maturational\nassumptions are signaled by concepts such as \u201ctrait,\u201d the search for \u201cthe aggression gene,\u201d the discovery of the brain\nsystem, hormone, or neurotransmitter responsible for a specific condition, or any other terms that suggest development\nis solely the product of innate or immutable characteristics of individuals. Although they are not typically referred to\nas \u201cmaturational,\u201d there are many kinds of theories that place all the active ingredients of behavior or development\ninside the head (or more specifically the social cognitions) of the person. Even if they are not direct descendants, these\ntheories can be considered cousins of Maturational meta-theories because they are exclusively focused on the role of\nthe individual.\nThe prototypic Mechanistic theories are behaviorist, operant, and classical conditioning learning theories, like social\nlearning theory. This family of theories dominated psychology from the early to the mid-20th century, but Mechanistic\ntheories are still alive and well in many areas, such as learning and motivation, and especially in many theories\nthat have been adapted for use in educational systems. New kinds of machines serve as prototypes for mechanistic\ntheories of memory, learning, and automatic functioning\u2014focusing on the computer, the robot, and the automaton.\nWhat is Development? | 15 Such assumptions have even pervaded our understanding of biological systems, as seen in metaphors like \u201cthe brain is\na computer.\u201d And although the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d was supposed to have overthrown behaviorist assumptions, some\ncognitivistic theories treat humans as if they were information processing machines.\nPerhaps surprisingly, there are also mechanistic assumptions embedded in certain progressive analyses of the effects\nof societal and social conditions, such as poverty, oppression, racism, and discrimination, which sometimes seem to\nimply that these external forces are the sole determinants of the development of stereotypes or implicit attitudes. In\nthis case, because all people are presumed to passively internalize these societal prejudices, psychological phenomena\nare modeled after the metaphor of the \u201cXerox machine.\u201d Just as in Maturational meta-theories, where humans could be\nseen as \u201chosts\u201d to their genes, who were really running the show, in Mechanistic meta-theories, humans can be seen as\n\u201chosts\u201d to their own behaviors, which are automatically reflexively produced based on previous social programming.\nThe prototypical Organismic theory is Piaget\u2019s constructivist theory of cognitive and affective development, and the\nseveral neo-constructivist theories that were inspired by Piaget, for example, Kohlberg\u2019s theory of the development\nof moral reasoning. Other theories living under the Organismic umbrella include Werner\u2019s comparative psychology,\nfocusing on the orthogenetic principle of differentiation and integration, and Erikson, who posited universal age-\ngraded developmental tasks. Other theories that claim kinship with Organismic meta-theories (e.g., theories of intrinsic\nmotivation) do not typically include notions of universal stages or tasks, but focus instead on Organismic assumptions\nabout the nature of humans, specifically, that humans are innately active, curious, and interested, and inherently desire\nto explore, understand, and fit in with their social and physical environments. With the rise of radical contextualism and\ncultural relativism in psychology, theories of \u201cuniversal\u201d anything (e.g., psychological needs, stages, developmental tasks)\nhave come increasingly under attack.\nSome of the better-known members of the Contextualist family include Bronfenbrenner\u2019s bio-ecological model and\nthe lifespan approach, both of which arose in reaction to dominant meta-theories of their day (experimental child\npsychology and Piagetian psychology, respectively), with their almost exclusive focus on the child as a developing\nindividual. The \u201ccontextualist\u201d moniker reflects these perspectives\u2019 insistence that development unfolds within and is\nshaped by higher-order multi-level ecological or contextual forces outside the individual, such as microsystem settings,\nand societal, cultural, and historical contexts.\nDoes the field of psychology have meta-theories?\nDuring different historical periods, specific meta-theories dominated the field of psychology. For example, during the\n1940s and 1950s, behaviorism held sway. In the 1960s, Piaget\u2019s theories were introduced to the United States and\ncaptured the field\u2019s attention. Some fierce theoretical and empirical battles were fought between behaviorists and\nPiagetians.\nWhen a specific meta-theory governs the field, it becomes very difficult for researchers from opposing meta-theories\nto work\u2014they have trouble getting funding, they have trouble getting their research findings published, and they are\nmarginalized by other researchers. For example, when the area of motivation was dominated by behaviorists (who\nbelieved that all behavior was motivated by rewards and punishments), it was very difficult for researchers to study and\npublish research on intrinsic motivation.\nWhat is the dominant meta-theory in the field today?\n\u201cCognitivism\u201d is a guiding meta-theory in the field of psychology today. \u201cCognitivism\u201d is the assumption that all the\ncausal factors that shape human behavior and development are inside the mind or belief system of the person. You\ncan hear the assumptions in the theories of the field: self-efficacy, self-esteem, attributions, perceived social support,\nvalues, sense of purpose, goal orientations, internal working model, identity, and so on.\nThe paradigm that is currently taking over the field of psychology is neuroscience. That is, the brain is in charge of\n16 | What is Development? behavior, and neurobiology is destiny. Some branches of neuroscience are predominantly Maturational, as seen in\ndiscussions of the brain systems responsible for certain actions, predilections, and characteristics. Other branches are\nmore Contextual, for example, research on neuroplasticity, which examines the way that social contexts and interactions\nshape the developing brain.\nNews flash: In the field of psychology outside developmental, most researchers assume that people don\u2019t develop.\nIn personality, social, cognitive, and industrial-organizational psychology, researchers largely examine individual\ndifferences as indicators of people\u2019s permanent characteristics.\nWho else has meta-theories?\nEveryone has meta-theories about human nature and development: parents, teachers, nurses, social workers, doctors,\nbusiness people, artists, politicians, and so on.\nFor example,\n\u2022 doctors assume that weight loss is all about diet and exercise (nurture), so no one can do research on physiological\ndifferences in metabolism (nature).\n\u2022 teachers have assumptions about whether students come with motivation (nature) or have to be motivated from\nthe outside (nurture), and organize their classrooms accordingly.\n\u2022 parents often argue about the nature of children\u2019s development, whether it\u2019s just the child\u2019s personality\n(maturational), or the child is going through a normal stage (organismic), or if they are rewarding the wrong\nbehavior (mechanistic).\nWhat is the meta-theory that guides our class and this book?\nOur class endorses a life-span perspective on human development, a contextualist perspective that fought its way\nthrough the dominant perspectives in child psychology (e.g., development ends at age 18), starting in the 1980s\nto become one of the dominant meta-theories governing the field of developmental science today. Note that your\ninstructors chose your book, so their meta-theory is influencing the meta-theoretical filter through which you are\nlearning about development.\nWhat is the correct meta-theory?\nThere is no single correct definition of development or meta-theory. Really. Even the lifespan approach has its\ndrawbacks.\nHowever, as research accumulates, many theories derived from certain meta-theories have been found to be\nincomplete\u2014so far researchers have not found any significant aspect of development that is caused only by nature or\nonly by nurture. Therefore, most researchers currently say they favor interactionist metatheories, like contextualist or\nsystems meta-theories. However, it is important to look carefully at researchers\u2019 actual work, because sometimes they\nsay that they have one meta-theory, but their work seems to be guided by assumptions from a different meta-theory.\nDo I have a meta-theory about development?\nYes, you do. And you can figure out what it is. Although it\u2019s not easy, you can discern your own assumptions about\ndevelopment\u2014by thinking about which assumptions make the most sense to you. You can also see which kinds of\ntheories you prefer and what kinds of recommendations you would make about how to structure development, like how\npeople should parent, teach, or make policies. The hardest part about discovering your own meta-theory is realizing that\nit is made up of assumptions you have (based on your experiences and messages from society)\u2014that aren\u2019t necessarily\ntrue. Our meta-theories sure seem true to each of us!\nWhat is Development? | 17 How do I get rid of my meta-theory?\nIt\u2019s not really possible to get rid of all of our assumptions. It is our goal to be aware of our own assumptions or meta-\ntheories, to realize that they are not the truth but are our current working models of how the world operates and people\ndevelop. The most important thing is to be explicit about our assumptions and to be cognizant of how they are guiding\nour actions. It is a goal of this class to help students figure out their own assumptions and to help them become (or\nremain) open to alternative viewpoints.\nAdapted from: Ellen Skinner, Glen Richardson, Jennifer Pitzer, and Cynthia Taylor. Portland State University. July 2011.\nHistorical Theories of Development\nPreformationist View: Well into the 18th century, children were merely\nthought of as little adults. Preformationism, or the belief that a tiny, fully\nformed human is implanted in the sperm or egg at conception and then\ngrows in size until birth, was the predominant early theory. Children\nwere believed to possess all their sensory capabilities, emotions, and\nmental aptitude at birth, and as they developed these abilities unfolded\non a predetermined schedule (Thomas, 1979). The environment was\nthought to play no role in determining development.\nJohn Locke (1632-1704): Locke, a British philosopher, refuted the idea of\ninnate knowledge and instead proposed that children are largely shaped\nby their social environments, especially their education as adults teach\nthem important knowledge. He believed that through education a child\nlearns socialization, or what is needed to be an appropriate member of\nsociety. Locke advocated thinking of a child\u2019s mind as a tabula rasa or\nblank slate, and whatever comes into the child\u2019s mind comes from the\nenvironment. Locke emphasized that the environment is especially\npowerful in the child\u2019s early life because he considered the mind the Figure 1.5. A 17th century illustration of tiny people\ninside a sperm\nmost pliable then. Locke indicated that the environment exerts its\neffects through associations between thoughts and feelings, behavioral repetition, imitation, and rewards and\npunishments (Crain, 2005). Locke\u2019s ideas laid the groundwork for the behavioral perspective and subsequent learning\ntheories of Pavlov, Skinner and Bandura.\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): Like Locke, Rousseau also believed that children were not just little adults. However,\nhe did not believe they were blank slates, but instead developed according to a natural plan which unfolded in different\nstages (Crain, 2005). He did not believe in teaching them the correct way to think, but believed children should be\nallowed to think by themselves according to their own ways and an inner, biological timetable. This focus on biological\nmaturation resulted in Rousseau being considered the father of developmental psychology. Followers of Rousseau\u2019s\ndevelopmental perspective include Gesell, Montessori, and Piaget.\nArnold Gesell (1880-1961): Gesell spent 50 years at the Yale Clinic of Child Development, and with his colleagues he\nstudied the neuromotor development of children. Gesell believed that the child\u2019s development was activated by genes\nand he called this process maturation (Crain, 2005). Further, he believed that development unfolded in fixed sequences,\nand he opposed efforts to teach children ahead of schedule as he believed they will engage in behaviors when their\nnervous systems had sufficiently matured.\n18 | What is Development? Sigmund Freud (1856-1939): Freud was a very influential figure in the area of\ndevelopment. Freud emphasized the importance of early childhood\nexperiences in shaping our personality and behavior. In our natural state, we\nare biological beings and are driven primarily by instincts. During childhood,\nhowever, we begin to become social beings as we learn how to manage our\ninstincts and transform them into socially acceptable behaviors. His\nassumptions were that personality formed during the first few years of life.\nThe ways in which parents or other caregivers interacted with children were\nassumed to have a long-lasting impact on children\u2019s emotional states. His\nbeliefs formed the psychodynamic perspective and his theories of\npsychosexual development and psychopathology dominated the field of\npsychiatry until the growth of behaviorism in the 1950s.\nHowever, Freud\u2019s theory has been heavily criticized for several reasons. One is\nthat it is very difficult to test scientifically (Crews, 1998). Freud suggested that\nmuch of what determines our actions were unknown to us, and as scientists\nwe cannot measure these unconscious concepts. A second criticism is that\nFigure 1.6. Sigmund Freud Freud\u2019s case studies were not validated and cannot be used as evidence for his\ntheories. Many later theories, particularly behaviorism and humanism, came\nabout as challenges to Freud\u2019s views.\nContemporary Theories on Development\nErikson (1902-1994) and Psychosocial Theory: Now, let\u2019s turn to a less\ncontroversial psychodynamic theorist, Erik Erikson. Erikson presents eight\ndevelopmental stages that encompass the entire lifespan. For that reason,\nErikson\u2019s psychosocial theory forms the foundation for much of our\ndiscussion of psychosocial development.\nErikson (1950) proposed a model of lifespan development that provides a\nuseful guideline for thinking about the changes we experience throughout\nlife. Erikson broke with Freud\u2019s emphasis on sexuality as the cornerstone of\nsocial-emotional development and instead suggested that social\nrelationships fostered development. Erikson proposed that each period of\nlife has a unique challenge or crisis that the person who reaches it must face,\nreferred to as psychosocial crises. According to Erikson, successful\ndevelopment involves dealing with and resolving the goals and demands of\neach of these psychosocial crises in a positive way. These crises are usually\ncalled stages, although that is not the term Erikson used. If a person does\nnot resolve a stage successfully, it may hinder their ability to deal with later\nFigure 1.7. Erik Erikson\nstages. For example, the person who does not develop a sense of trust\n(Erikson\u2019s first stage) may find it challenging as an adult to form a positive intimate relationship (Erikson\u2019s sixth stage).\nOr an individual who does not develop a clear sense of purpose and identity (Erikson\u2019s fifth stage) may become self-\nabsorbed and stagnate rather than work toward the betterment of others (Erikson\u2019s seventh stage).\nHowever, most individuals are able to successfully complete the eight stages of his theory (See Table 1.3).\nWhat is Development? | 19 Table 1.3 Erikson's Psychosocial Stages\nAge range Psychosocial crisis Positive resolution of crisis\nBirth to 12 to 18\nTrust versus Mistrust The child develops a feeling of trust in caregivers.\nmonths\n18 months to 3 Autonomy versus\nThe child learns what can and cannot be controlled and develops a sense of free will.\nyears Shame/Doubt\nThe child learns to become independent by exploring, manipulating, and taking\n3 to 6 years Initiative versus Guilt\naction.\nIndustry versus The child learns to do things well or correctly according to standards set by others,\n6 to 12 years\nInferiority particularly in school.\nIdentity versus Role The adolescent develops a well-defined and positive sense of self in relationship to\n12 to 18 years\nConfusion others.\nIntimacy versus The person develops the ability to give and receive love and to make long-term\n19 to 40 years\nIsolation commitments.\nGenerativity versus The person develops an interest in guiding the development of the next generation,\n40 to 65 years\nStagnation often by becoming a parent.\nEgo Integrity versus\n65 to death The person develops acceptance of how one has lived.\nDespair\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nErikson\u2019s theory has been criticized for focusing so heavily on crises and assuming that the completion of one crisis is\na prerequisite for the next crisis of development. His theory also focused on the social expectations that are found in\ncertain cultures, but not in all. For instance, the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity might translate\nwell in the middle-class culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where the transition into adulthood\ncoincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles offer fewer choices.\nLearning Theory: Also known as Behaviorism, is based on the premise that it is not possible to objectively study the mind,\nand therefore psychologists should limit their attention to the study of behavior itself. The most famous behaviorist was\nBurrhus Frederick (B. F.) Skinner (1904\u20131990), who expanded the principles of behaviorism and also brought them to the\nattention of the public at large. Skinner used the ideas of stimulus and response, along with the application of rewards\nor reinforcements, to train pigeons and other animals. In addition, he used the general principles of behaviorism to\ndevelop theories about how best to teach children and how to create societies that were peaceful and productive\n(Skinner, 1957, 1968, 1972).\nThe behaviorists made substantial contributions to psychology by identifying the principles of learning. Although the\nbehaviorists were incorrect in their beliefs that it was not possible to measure thoughts and feelings, their ideas\nprovided new insights that helped further our understanding regarding the nature-nurture debate as well as the\nquestion of free will. The ideas of behaviorism are fundamental to psychology and have been developed to help us better\nunderstand the role of prior experiences in a variety of areas of psychology.\nSocial Learning Theory, or learning by watching others, was developed by Albert Bandura (1977). His theory calls our\nattention to the ways in which many of our actions are not learned through conditioning, as suggested by Skinner. Young\nchildren frequently learn behaviors through imitation. Especially when children do not know what else to do, they learn\nby modeling or copying the behavior of others.\nBandura (1986) suggests that there is interplay between the environment and the individual. We are not just the product\nof our surroundings, rather we influence our surroundings. There is interplay between our personality and the way we\ninterpret events and how they influence us. This concept is called reciprocal determinism. An example of this might be\nthe interplay between parents and children. Parents not only influence their child\u2019s environment, perhaps intentionally\n20 | What is Development? through the use of reinforcement, etc., but children influence parents as well. Parents may respond differently with\ntheir first child than with their fourth. Perhaps they try to be the perfect parents with their firstborn, but by the time\ntheir last child comes along they have very different expectations, both of themselves and their child. Our environment\ncreates us and we create our environment.\nOther social influences: TV or not TV? Bandura, Ross and Ross (1963) began a series of\nstudies to look at the impact of television on the behavior of children. Bandura began\nby conducting an experiment in which he showed children a film of a woman hitting\nan inflatable clown or \u201cbobo\u201d doll. Then the children were allowed in the room, where\nthey found the doll and during their play they began to hit it. The children also\ndemonstrated novel ways of being aggressive toward the doll that were not\ndemonstrated by those children who did not see the aggressive model. Bandura\u2019s\nresearch raised concerns about the impact of violence on young children. Since then,\nconsiderable research has been conducted on the impact of violent media on children\u2019s\naggression including playing video games.\nCognitive Theory: The cognitive theories focus on how our mental processes or\ncognitions change over time. Three important theories are Jean Piaget\u2019s, Lev Vygotsky\u2019s,\nand Information-processing.\nJean Piaget (1896-1980) was one of the most influential cognitive theorists in\ndevelopment. He was inspired to explore children\u2019s ability to think and reason by\nFigure 1.8. A bobo doll\nwatching his own children\u2019s development. He was one of the first to recognize and map\nout the ways in which children\u2019s intelligence differs from that of adults (Piaget, 1929).\nHe became interested in this area when he was asked to test the IQ of children and began to notice that there was a\npattern in their wrong answers. He believed that children\u2019s intellectual skills change over time and that maturation,\nrather than training, brings about that change. Children of differing ages interpret the world differently. Piaget theorized\nthat children progressed through four stages of cognitive development (see Table 1.4).\nTable 1.4 Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development\nApproximate\nStage Characteristics Stage attainments\nage range\nBirth to\nChildren experience the world through their fundamental senses of seeing,\nSensorimotor about 2 Object permanence\nhearing, touching, and tasting.\nyears\nChildren acquire the ability to internally represent the world through Theory of mind;\nPreoperational 2 to 7 years language and mental imagery.

Looking across cultures reveals considerable variation in\nWhat is Development? | 21 what children are able to do at various ages. Research has shown considerable overlap among the four stages and that\ndevelopment is more continuous.\nLev Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who wrote in the early 1900s, but whose work was not discovered\nby researchers in the United States until the 1960s and became more widely known in the 1980s (Crain, 2005). His\nsociocultural theory emphasizes the importance of culture and interaction in the development of cognitive abilities.\nVygotsky differed with Piaget in that he believed that a person not only has a set of abilities, but also a set of potential\nabilities that can be realized if given the proper guidance from others. Vygotsky developed theories on teaching that\nhave been adopted by educators today.\nInformation Processing is not the work of a single theorist, but based on the ideas and research of several cognitive\nscientists studying how individuals perceive, analyze, manipulate, use, and remember information. This approach assumes\nthat humans gradually improve in their processing skills; that is, cognitive development is continuous rather than stage-\nlike. The more complex mental skills of adults are built from the primitive abilities of children. We are born with the\nability to notice stimuli, store, and retrieve information. Brain maturation enables advancements in our information\nprocessing system. At the same time, interactions with the environment also aid in our development of more effective\nstrategies for processing information.\nUrie Bronfenbrenner (1917-2005) developed the Ecological Systems Theory, which provides a framework for\nunderstanding and studying the many influences on human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Bronfenbrenner\nrecognized that human interaction is influenced by larger social forces and that an understanding of these forces is\nessential for understanding an individual. The individual is impacted by several systems including:\n\u2022 Microsystem includes the individual\u2019s setting and those who have direct, significant contact with the person, such as\nparents or siblings. The input of those is modified by the cognitive and biological state of the individual as well.\nThese influence the person\u2019s actions, which in turn influence systems operating on him or her.\n\u2022 Mesosystem includes the larger organizational structures, such as school, the family, or religion. These institutions\nimpact the microsystems just described. The philosophy of the school system, daily routine, assessment methods,\nand other characteristics can affect the child\u2019s self-image, growth, sense of accomplishment, and schedule thereby\nimpacting the child, physically, cognitively, and emotionally.\n\u2022 Exosystem includes the larger contexts of community. A community\u2019s values, history, and economy can impact the\norganizational structures it houses. Mesosystems both influence and are influenced by the exosystem.\n\u2022 Macrosystem includes the cultural elements, such as global economic conditions, war, technological trends, values,\nphilosophies, and a society\u2019s responses to the global community.\n\u2022 Chronosystem is the historical context in which these experiences occur. This relates to the different generational\ntime periods previously discussed, such as the baby boomers and millennials.\nIn sum, a child\u2019s experiences are shaped by larger forces, such as the family, schools, religion, culture, and time\nperiod. Bronfenbrenner\u2019s model helps us understand all of the different environments that impact each one of us\nsimultaneously. Despite its comprehensiveness, Bronfenbrenner\u2019s ecological system\u2019s theory is not easy to use. Taking\ninto consideration all the different influences makes it difficult to research and determine the impact of all the different\nvariables (Dixon, 2003). Consequently, psychologists have not fully adopted this approach, although they recognize the\nimportance of the ecology of the individual. Figure 1.9 is a model of Bronfenbrenner\u2019s Ecological Systems Theory.\n22 | What is Development? Figure 1.9.

Whether\nwe are aware of it or not, all of us are shaping development every day through our decisions and actions. Sometimes\nthis is obvious\u2013 when we are raising children or teaching preschoolers. In these situations, we know we are trying\nto help our children and students learn and grow. We think carefully about how we were raised or taught, about our\nprofessional training. We take these responsibilities seriously. We know what a difference people in our lives have made\nto our development. However, in cases where we are not explicitly charged with promoting development, we may not\nthink as carefully about our effects on others\u2013 like our friends, romantic partners, or parents. We may not think about\nour own development, the ways we nurture or disparage ourselves.\nIn this class, we are calling all the ways we influence development \u201cdevelopmental practices.\u201d By this, we mean all the\ndecisions and actions we take in our professional and personal lives that shape our own and others\u2019 development.\nWhen we hear the word \u201cpractices,\u201d we often think about professional practices. But we also include personal practices,\nlike how we parent, make decisions about vocations, and nurture our friends. From this perspective, we are all\ndevelopmental \u201cpractitioners\u201d even though we may not feel like we really understand how best to do this job.\nDevelopmental science, along with other important sources of information, contribute to our understanding of \u201cbest\ndevelopmental practices.\u201d Science is a powerful process of learning, but it also has its limitations. Science uses multiple\nkinds of methodologies, ways of collecting information, and designs, each with its strengths and limitations and\nits hidden assumptions. Since research methods are central in producing valid and useful knowledge, we have to\nbe thoughtful and critical about the processes and tools of science. Learning more about research methods in\ndevelopmental science can also contribute to your learning more about important ways to promote healthy\ndevelopment, both your own and others.\nWhat is science and how does it fit with other ways of knowing?\nAt its core, science is a way of knowing: a set of practices for learning about the world. There are many other ways of\nknowing, including our intuition, emotions, and observations; the beliefs and customs of our families and neighbors; the\nopinions of friends and peers; communications from political and religious authorities; and messages from the media.\nIf we bundle all these other sources of information together, they make up our\u201cpersonal experience.\u201d From this history,\nwe form opinions about the contents of development: how people change and remain the same, what is \u201cnormal,\u201d the\ncauses of healthy and unhealthy development, and what we should do to be good parents, educators, and friends.\nHow Do We Learn How to Promote Development? | 27 Our experiences are embedded in particular cultural and historical contexts. These contexts have many strengths, but\nthey also have their own implicit biases. Our personal convictions, based on a lifetime of experiences in these societal\ncontexts and historical times, are naturally very compelling. We even have a name for the sets of gripping assumptions\nthat underlie them: Na\u00efve meta-theories of human development.\nA second source of information about how to support development can be called \u201cprofessional experience.\u201d Many callings\nand professions shape development, like parenting, education, nursing, social work, coaching, and so on. And each\ncomes with its own set of trainings, traditions, and practices. Some of these practices are drawn from research (as\nwe will discuss shortly), others from personal experience of what has worked in the past, and others are simply \u201cthe\nway things have always been done.\u201d Take, for example, the practices you see in our classroom: Learning takes place in\ngroups, with a leader called the teacher, and involves readings, assignments, and grades. Such practices are based on a\nsociety\u2019s history of carrying out these tasks, and they are reinforced by educational and training programs. Professional\nexperiences are also embedded in the institutions of our time and place, as seen in schools, health care systems,\nhuman services, and other workplaces. These organizations, and our education and training, provide us with skills and\ninformation. At the same time, they have their own implicit biases. And, just like personal experience, professional\nexperience has its own baked in assumptions about humans and how they develop.\nWhat are the limitations of personal and professional experience?\nThe limitations of personal and professional experience are easiest to see in the past, when for example, doctors used\nprocedures, like blood-letting, to treat patients that were not effective, or schools employed corporal punishment, or\nwomen were not allowed into certain professions. Our personal experiences can also be limiting. Often the ways we\nwere raised seem right to us, even though all of us have absorbed implicit biases and none of us were raised by perfect\ncaregivers. We often sense that our caregivers made mistakes, even as we find ourselves repeating those same parenting\npractices. Professionally and personally, we are not always sure how to shake free of our past and do things a better way.\nOur personal and professional experiences are important sources of information about development. But the growing\nrecognition of their limitations has led to the rise of what are called \u201cevidence-based\u201d or \u201cevidence-informed\u201d practices.\nSeen most clearly in medicine, these practices come out of the scientific study of alternative ways to care for patients\nand treat different conditions. Whole centers are dedicated to studying and compiling best medical practices. And\ndoctors, as professionals, are expected to adhere to them. As knowledge about medicine progresses, these \u201cbest\npractices\u201d are continually updated with new evidence.\nWhere do \u201cbest\u201d practices for promoting development come from?\nBest practices emerge at the intersection between the scientific study of development and the knowledge of expert\npractitioners. Lessons about best developmental practices are gathered, not from individual studies that test\nexplanations and interventions, but from whole lines of work that over time replicate findings from multiple\nperspectives. These are called \u201cbodies of evidence,\u201d and they converge on insights about the most effective ways to\nsupport development. For example, even though pediatricians in the 1950s warned mothers that picking babies up\nwhen they cry reinforces their crying and spoils them, a body of evidence on attachment revealed this advice to be\nwrong. Infants cry less and are more secure if caregivers respond consistently and sensitively to their needs. That\u2019s why\nscience-based practices are called \u201cevidence-informed.\u201d\nIn a complementary fashion, expert practitioners bring knowledge about what works. Experts emerge from everyday\nwalks of life, like wise and skilled elders, teachers, caregivers, coaches, and social workers. As we are reinventing\npractices, we can reflect on and bring forward their insights and lessons. For example, many cultural traditions\nhighlight the precious nature of children and the elderly, as treasures to be cherished, and underscore the centrality\nof family, community, and cultural heritage in supporting their well-being and development. These insights can be\n28 | How Do We Learn How to Promote Development? used to critique and reconsider our current practices, in which those who care for children and the elderly are often\nundervalued, underpaid, and not well supported by the larger community.\nThe lessons gained from scientific evidence and expert practitioners are called \u201cbest practices,\u201d and they are\ntransforming all the callings and professions that shape development. A whole area of research, called \u201cimplementation\nscience,\u201d studies methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices, interventions and\npolicies into routine settings. Sometimes practitioners need support to help them adopt these practices because\nevidence-informed ways of doing things run counter to conventional practice, or require more effort to learn or more\nwork to execute. Or they can be introduced in ways that alienate practitioners. However, if implementation scientists\ncreate respectful and collaborative partnerships with parents, professionals, and other stakeholders, they can together\ncontribute to and learn about such best practices. In the long run, best practices help all practitioners (including people\nnot usually considered \u201cpractitioners\u201d\u2013 like caregivers, romantic partners, and friends) become more reflective and\neffective in their efforts to promote their own and others\u2019 development.\nWhere does the idea of culture fit into the search for evidence-informed best practices?\nOne important lesson learned from implementation science is that best practices have to be culturally attuned to the\npeople and places where they are adopted. Sometimes, \u201cgood\u201d practices are narrowly defined and reflect evidence from\nthe study of white middle class participants. It does not make sense to treat these practices as a module that should\nbe inserted everywhere. Many different cultural variations on a given practice are \u201cgood.\u201d As a result, interventionists\nhave been pressed to identify the \u201cessential ingredients\u201d in effective practices and study how those ingredients can be\nincorporated in very different ways by people from different cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean, however, that every common practice from every culture is good for development.\nThe complexity of incorporating culture into best practices can be seen in the example of nutrition and diet. On the one\nhand, science has identified the combination of essential nutrients that all humans need to support the development of\nhealthy bodies and minds. On the other hand, there are as many variations of healthy diets as there are cultures around\nthe world. Any diet that provides all the micronutrients that humans need are examples of best practices. On the third\nhand, however, it is not true that any old foods caregivers give children represent a healthy diet. The scientific study of\nnutrition provides a set of criteria we can use to scrutinize and critique foods\u2013 like sugary soft drinks or fast food\u2013 for\ntheir nutritional value. From this perspective, we can identify dietary practices, even ones that are very common, that\nwe can conclude are not good for development.\nAlmost everyone agrees that practitioners should be using culturally-attuned evidence-informed practices. At the same\ntime, there is vigorous debate about what these best practices really are. The tension between science, practice, and\nculture is productive. In general, science is good at finding narrow, relatively specific, explanations and optimization\nstrategies. Cultures offer critiques of these strategies as well as many variations on how they can be implemented. And\npractitioners create more wholistic ways to integrate specific strategies, along with many other practices, into their\ndaily interactions with developing people. Wise culturally-attuned practitioners are always pushing science\u2013 to ask\nquestions that apply more directly to the problems they are trying to solve and the people they are trying to support.\nThis kind of science is sometimes called \u201capplied science\u201d because it is purpose-driven and aims to study and help solve\nimportant social problems.\nAre all recommended practices based on good science?\nNo. Many people claim scientific backing for their ideas and advice, when it does not really exist. This is called\n\u201cpseudoscience\u201d or simply\u2013 bad popular science. There are many ways to recognize bad popular science, as explained in\nthis supplementary section.\nPseudoscience or Bad Popular Science [pdf]\nHow Do We Learn How to Promote Development? | 29 Science as a Powerful Way of Knowing\nScience is not perfect and it needs to be guided by strong ethical principles, but nevertheless it is a powerful way\nof knowing and an important source of knowledge. Science is based on the assumption that careful and systematic\nobservation and thought are processes we can use to better understand ourselves and our world. The process of\nscience describes a way of learning. Scientific knowledge is built by testing ideas using evidence gathered from the\nsocial and natural world. Initially, these ideas are tentative intuitions, but as they cycle through the process of science\nagain and again, they are examined and tested in different ways, so we become increasingly confident about their\nvalidity. Through this same recursive process, the ideas themselves are clarified, revised, and integrated into more\npowerful understandings. Over time, this process serves to construct complex scientific knowledge that can be used for\nmany purposes: to solve everyday problems, address societal issues, develop tools and technology, and make informed\ndecisions. Such understandings satisfy our curiosity and lead to new questions.\nThe work of science has many strengths. First, it is a public enterprise. It takes place as part of a scientific community\nthat scrutinizes, questions, and evaluates everyone\u2019s work. This international community is composed of peer experts,\nwho are charged with thinking through the quality of the research, the validity of the findings, and interpretations of\nthe evidence. Scientists are trained to be skeptical problem-solvers and when bad science is introduced, it is usually\ndetected and called out by experts. When independent scientists from all over the world come to the same conclusion,\nthis strengthens our confidence in the quality of the evidence.\nSecond, science is informed by deep reservoirs of accumulated knowledge, but it is also inherently open, challenged\ndaily by new ideas and updated with new evidence. Scientists spend their adult lives developing expertise, learning\neverything there is to know about their areas of study. As part of research teams, they construct dense, detailed, and\nrich understandings of complex phenomena. They use their curiosity, creativity, and determination to produce new\nknowledge and insights. At the same time, scientists question everything. They remain skeptical. They look for flaws\nand limitations in their own and others\u2019 work and consider alternatives. When research is done ethically, scientists goal\nshould not be to prove their own theories right. They should be committed to finding out what is really happening, even\nif that means proving their ideas wrong. The best science, which is not as common as it should be, is dedicated to this\nhigher pursuit.\nThird, science continuallycritiques and reinvents itself. Scientists create new tools and strategies that allow us to see\nmore and learn more from what we are seeing. In research on human development, these innovative methods and\ntechnologies range from new devices to collect data daily, to new laboratory experiments and simulations, and new\nways to learn about what babies are thinking. Some of the most exciting breakthroughs are produced by new tools for\ncollecting and integrating information. This way of learning also leads to major shifts in scientific understanding, called\n\u201cscientific revolutions\u201d or \u201cparadigm shifts,\u201d when accepted theories are stood on their heads and we must reconsider\neverything we thought we knew.\nScience is a challenging and fascinating process. The evidence it produces, messy and confusing at times, leads\ncumulatively to insights and understanding. It is an important way of knowing and learning\u2013 this collective public\nprocess of observing and making sense of what we see and then, based on this new way of thinking, going back and\ntaking a second (and third and fourth) look. Over the last 100 years, much has been learned about humans and how we\ndevelop, but many more questions remain. We strongly encourage you to incorporate the knowledge that developmental\nscience has gleaned in your own everyday decision-making and practices. In fact, you might even consider a career in\ndevelopmental science!\n30 | How Do We Learn How to Promote Development?

Serious critiques focus on the assumptions underlying western science today, and the ways they contribute\nto exclusion and distortion in ongoing scientific work. Science today is dominated by researchers from the United States,\nCanada, and northern Europe. The most prestigious scientific journals are published in English, which is also considered\nthe \u201cinternational language\u201d at conferences. Psychologists routinely study phenomena from a Eurocentric perspective\n(Teo & Febrarro, 2003), but they assume that this position is the default\u2013 both normal and universal. They are often\nunaware of the perspectives of non-western psychologists, and dismiss knowledge from non-western researchers. Such\nresearch is called \u201cAfrican psychology\u201d or \u201cTurkish psychology\u201d without labeling western science as \u201cEuroamerican\npsychology.\u201d\nSecond, scientists often assume that science has a monopoly on ways of knowing. However, many disciplines outside\nof the social and natural sciences reveal important insights about the nature of humans and how they change and\ngrow. These include the humanities and arts, like creative writing, (e.g., memoirs, novels, science fiction), theatre arts\n(e.g., plays, motion pictures), music (e.g., songs, drumming, and choral singing), and dance. These are sometimes called\nilluminative tools, and can be useful in capturing and sharing insights about the human experience. In the same vein,\nmany cultures have accumulated knowledge about a wide range of human activities, like teaching and rearing children,\nand supporting families. This knowledge is often more wholistic, systemic, and better attuned to humanistic values, like\nenvironmental stewardship and social justice. However, scientists often dismiss or exclude this knowledge from teaching\nand learning (Pillay, 2017). Systemic practices that exclude specific groups of people from science and universities\nnarrow the range of talent, cultural expertise, and lived experience researchers can bring to bear on these important\nissues.\nA third critique focuses on assumptions commonly held by scientists from the dominant culture that distort the\nscientific study of marginalized or minority groups. Scientists (often unknowingly) accept entrenched societal myths\nabout marginalized groups. For example, until 1973, homosexuality was classified as a mental illness in the American\nPsychological Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Such problems are also obvious in\ndeeply problematic programs of research that explain achievement gaps and differential drop-out rates for children\nand youth from ethnic and minority backgrounds, by arguing for \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in children or \u201ccultural disadvantage\u201d\nin families (Valencia & Sol\u00f3rzano, 1997). These issues are explained as individual or family problems, instead of being\nstudied as the accumulated results of systemic societal inequities. The resilience and strengths of families and\ncommunities in the face of these inequities (Yosso, 2005) are often either dismissed or relied upon as the sole avenue of\nintervention, rendering discriminatory institutions invisible.\nThese biased diatribes have a long history in the scientific community. Such disinformation, which is both harmful and\ndangerous, continues to appear in mainstream scientific outlets today and is used to justify and protect anti-Black racist\npolicies and institutions. In condemning such research, it is important to reflect not only on the individual prejudices\nthat underlie these research programs, but also on the larger scientific and academic systems that sponsor, publish,\nand amplify this work. An important source of insights and critique can be found in the interdisciplinary work in Black\nor Africana Studies, Indigenous Nation Studies, Chicano/Latino Studies, and Women, Gender, and Sexualities Studies.\nHow Do We Learn How to Promote Development? | 31 By decentering study from the dominant culture, scientists, humanists, and researchers in these fields surface and\nchallenge default assumptions, and offer alternative critical sociohistorically-informed accounts of development.\nFourth, current theories and research methods have been critiqued from inside developmental science based on their\nunderlying assumptions about humans and their development (e.g., Overton, 2015). You have seen how theories fall into\nmeta-theoretical camps and the use of specific theories creates a kind of tunnel vision about our target phenomena.\nIt turns out that research methods also have meta-theoretical assumptions baked into them. For example, if we bring\nchildren into the lab to learn more about them, we are assuming that we can remove a person from their natural context\nand still understand their functioning. For this reason, we often refer to \u201cresearch methodologies,\u201d instead of \u201cresearch\nmethods,\u201d to acknowledge that all methods bring along with them their own assumptions about ways of knowing or\nepistemologies. Individual scientists, as well as the research community as a whole, must regularly and actively reflect on\nand critique our methods, to understand the role they play in shaping our understanding of developmental processes.\nEpistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with ways of knowing. Epistemologies are theories of\nknowledge: what can be known, what qualifies as valid knowledge, how knowledge is gained, what kinds of\nmethods or tools can be used for learning, who can be a knowledge builder, and so on. Each meta-theory of\nhuman development not only has its own assumptions about the nature of people and their development,\nbut also its own assumptions about epistemology, or ways of knowing. For example, mechanistic meta-\ntheories assume that people and contexts are made up of parts, so they can be taken apart and studied\nseparately. In contrast, contextual meta-theories assume that person-context interactions are the basis of all\ndevelopment, so they must be studied together; if you take them apart to study them you destroy your\ntarget phenomenon.\nDevelopmental science will be stronger to the extent that scientists intentionally and openly discuss, criticize, and\nimprove the process of science itself. Scientists must open their collective minds to international researchers, multiple\ndisciplines, and a wide range of cultures as important sources of knowledge. Universities, as institutions that practice\nscience and train scientists, must also open their collective doors, by more actively welcoming, recruiting, nurturing,\nand learning from researchers from a broad range of backgrounds, especially those who have been historically\nmarginalized and excluded. As science and universities are more successful in their inclusion efforts, researchers should\nalso be ready to participate in cultural transformations within the scientific enterprise. Global and multidisciplinary\nhubs along with university-community partnerships create platforms that support complementary ways of knowing,\nand can enrich and transform processes of developmental science.\nTake Home Messages about Science as a Way of Knowing and Learning about the World\nWe would underscore four big ideas from this section:\n1. A primary reason science is a crucial way of knowing is that it complements other ways of knowing, like personal\nand professional experience, which together help us identify and test \u201cbest practices\u201d for promoting our own and\nothers\u2019 development. By \u201cpractices,\u201d we mean our decisions and actions, not only at work but also at home (e.g., in\nour parenting, how we relate to and support ourselves, our family members and friends, contribute to our\ncommunities and political systems, and so on).\n2. All ways of knowing, including science and experience, are historically and culturally embedded, and so best\npractices need to be continually scrutinized for biases and attuned culturally when they are collaboratively\nadapted to improve personal or professional practices. Cultures and current practices are rich sources of\ndevelopmental knowledge.\n32 | How Do We Learn How to Promote Development? 3. Science is a powerful way of knowing because it is a process that relies on careful thought and observation of the\nsocial and natural world, is carried out by the scientific community as a public enterprise, and is inherently open\nand continually critiquing andreinventing itself.\nScience itself is a historically- andculturally-embedded social enterprise and so has serious shortcomings. Critiques\nfocus on the exclusion ofcertain kinds of research (e.g., non-Euroamerican) and ways of knowing (e.g., non-scientific),\nthe harmful effects of researchers from dominant cultures\u2019 deficit-based andindividualistic analyses of the development\nand functioning of people from marginalized and oppressed groups, and the meta-theoretical assumptions baked into\nconventional scientific methods. Science and universities will benefit from ongoing openness andinclusion, reflection,\ncritique, reform, and transformation of its practices and institutions.\nAdapted from: Skinner, E.

The tools that scientists use to generate such knowledge are called research methods or methodologies.\nMany textbooks describe \u201cthe\u201d scientific method, as if there were only one way of knowing scientifically. Just as lifespan\ndevelopment spans multiple disciplines, each with their own preferred epistemologies and methodologies, we believe\nthat there are multiple scientific methods, or multiple perspectives, each one providing a complementary line of sight\non a given target phenomenon. Social and developmental sciences have been critiqued for our reliance on a narrow\nrange of methodologies, favoring methods that quantify observations (e.g., via surveys, ratings, or numerical codings)\nand control extraneous variables or confounds, either statistically or, for example, by bringing people into the lab.\nSometimes social scientists seem to favor these more quantitative methods, and to discount methodologies that are\nmore situated, contextualized, and wholistic, sometimes called qualitative methods.\n34 | Lifespan Developmental Research Methodologies However, it has become clear that these methodologies are not\nantagonistic. Instead, they are complementary ways of knowing\nor lines of sight on target phenomena, each whole and\nimportant in its own right, but incomplete. We think about\nthese multiple perspectives the same way that they are\ndescribed in the parable of the six blind men and the elephant.\nIn this story, each person makes contact with a different part of\nthe elephant and comes to his own conclusions\u2013 the one who\nencounters its legs explains that elephants are tree trunks, the\nears reveal it to be a fan, the flank a wall, the tail a rope, the\ntrunk a snake, and the tusk a spear. Each one\u2019s understanding is\ncorrect, but unknown to all of them, each is also incomplete.\nThey need the views from all of these perspectives, what we\no\nsometimes call 360 lines of sight, to fully appreciate the\nelephant in its wholeness and complexity. In the same way,\nmultiple cross-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and multi-\nFigure 2.1\ndisciplinary methodologies are needed to understand our\ndevelopmental phenomena in their wholeness and complexity. We find a lifespan developmental systems perspective\nespecially useful in articulating this view (Baltes, Reese, & Nesselroade, 1977; Cairns, Elder, & Costello, 2001; Lerner, 2006;\nOverton, 2010; Overton & Molenaar, 2015; Skinner, Kindermann, & Mashburn, 2019). The best research and graduate\ntraining programs in human development teach their doctoral students about a wide range of epistemologies and\nmethodologies and see them all as parts of \u201cconverging operations.\u201d\nWhat is meant by converging operations?\nThis was an idea, brought to the attention of developmentalists almost 50 years ago (Baer, 1973), to help deal with the\nunsettling realization that every method ever devised to conduct scientific studies has serious shortcomings. The main\nidea is that good science needs a wide variety of differing methodologies, so that the strengths of one can compensate\nfor the limitations of others. From this perspective, a body of evidence is much stronger when findings from multiple\ncomplementary methodologies converge on the same conclusions. That is why we favor developmental science that\nincorporates methodologies from many disciplines, and continues to question and critique those methodologies as part\nof its reflective practice.\nDeductive Methodologies\nIn discussions of scientific methods, the procedure that is often highlighted is the deductive method\u2014 in which a\nscientist starts with a falsifiable hypothesis and then conducts a series of observations to test whether the specifics on\nthe ground are consistent with this hypothesis. In this process, the scientist foregrounds \u201cthinking\u201d (the theory) and\nfollows this up with figuring out how to \u201clook\u201d (i.e., conduct the study or observation) in ways that test the validity of\nthis theory. This process unfolds in multiple recursive or circular steps, including:\n1. Formulate a question. Use initial observations to articulate a research question:\na. Review previous studies (known as a literature review) to determine what has been found to date\nb. Formulate a working theory of the target phenomenon and propose a hypothesis\n2. Conduct a study. Select or create a method of gathering information relevant to the hypothesis:\na. Who? Sampling. Determine the people to be included\nb. What? Measurement. Determine the measures to be used to capture the phenomena of interest\nLifespan Developmental Research Methodologies | 35 c. Where? Setting. Determine the setting where the study will take place\nd. How? andWhen? Design. Determine the study design\n3. Interpret the results. In light of everything you know, examine what the findings likely mean:\na. Consider the limitations of the study\nb. Draw conclusions, including rejecting the hypothesis and revising the original theory\nc. Suggest future studies\n4. Publish. Make the findings available to others:\na. Share information with the scientific community\nb. Invite scrutiny of work by other experts\nInductive Methodologies\nA second set of procedures is more inductive. This process, often called grounded theory, starts with a general question\nand then constructs a theory of the phenomenon based, not on the scientific community\u2019s or researcher\u2019s preconceived\nnotions, but on the researcher\u2019s actual observations of many specific experiences on the ground. As you can see, in\nthe process, the scientist foregrounds \u201clooking\u201d (the observations and experiences in the target setting) and uses this\nprocess to scaffold \u201cthinking\u201d (i.e., theorizing or building a mental model of what has been observed). This process also\nunfolds in multiple recursive or circular steps, including:\n1. Find a question. Begin with a broad area of interest and identify a research problem:\na. Review the literature to justify the importance of the problem\nb. See how the problem fits into a larger set of issues\nc. Identify the deficiencies in other work on the topic\n2. Gather information. Through extended first hand engagement, learn about the target:\na. Who? andWhere? Gain entrance into a group and natural setting relevant to the problem of study\nb. What? Ask open-ended, broad \u201cgrand tour\u201d types of questions when interviewing and observing participants;\nfocus on participant perspectives\nc. How? Gather field notes about the setting, the people, the structure, the activities or other areas of interest;\ncollect artifacts, pictures\nd. Reflect. Modify research questions as the study evolves and follow the emergent questions\n3. Make sense of the information. In light of all the specifics, reflect on what your observations likely mean:\na. Note own participation and biases\nb. Note patterns or consistencies, uncover themes, categories, interrelationships\nc. Focus on centrality of meaning of the participants\nd. Explore new areas deemed important by participants\n4. Report findings. Put together a coherent narrative that incorporates the themes and connections uncovered\na. Check back in with participants to get their perspectives on your interpretations\n36 | Lifespan Developmental Research Methodologies 5. Publish. Make the findings available to others:\na. Share information with the scientific community\nb. Invite scrutiny of work by other experts\nCollaborative Methodologies\nA third set of methodologies is based on the assumption that knowledge, research, and effective social action can best\nbe co-constructed among researchers and community participants, incorporating the strengths and perspectives of\nall the stakeholders involved in a particular set of issues. This approach, often called community-based participatory\naction research, holds that complex social issues cannot be well understood or resolved by \u201cexpert\u201d research, pointing\nto interventions from outside of the community which often have disappointing results or unintended side effects.\nIn collaborative approaches, researchers and community partners build a genuine trusting relationship, and this\ncooperative partnership is the basis on which all decisions about the project are made: from articulating a set of research\nquestions, to identifying data collection strategies, analysis and interpretation of information, and dissemination and\napplication of findings.\nThe process is inherently:\n1. Community-based. Researchers build a collaborative partnership with community members who are already living\nwith, involved in, or working on the problem of interest. Hence, this work is situated within neighborhoods and\ncommunity organizations or groups, and builds on their strengths and priorities. Instead of taking individuals out\nof communities and into lab settings for study or providing individualized therapy to \u201cfix\u201d broken individuals, the\ngoal of this work is to help facilitate change within the community itself, making it a more supportive context for\nall its inhabitants.\n2. Participatory. As the collaboration develops, members discuss and learn more about each other so that together\nthey can co-create and frame a common agenda for research and action. These projects incorporate researchers\u2019\nexpertise and goals, but they foreground the knowledge, concerns, and needs of community partners. For\nexample, researchers interested in homeless youth could reach out to youth-serving organizations and begin\nconversations exploring whether they would like to work together. These conversations would also soon involve\nthe homeless youth themselves, consistent with the slogan popularized by the disability rights movement,\n\u201cNothing about us without us!\u201d Community knowledge is considered irreplaceable as it provides key insights about\ntarget issues.\n3. Action. All research activities are anchored and oriented by the larger goal of enhancing strategic action that leads\nto social change and community transformation as part of the research program. Community action make take the\nform of public education surrounding community issues (e.g., information campaigns, teach-ins), changing existing\npolicies that harm groups of people (e.g., harsh discipline policies at school), creating new public spaces (e.g.,\ncommunity gardens and farmers\u2019 markets), and so on.\n4. Research. The community action plan is informed by organizing existing information and collecting new\ninformation from key stakeholders relevant to the community issues under scrutiny. Methods to conduct these\nstudies are planned together in ways that researchers believe will produce high quality information and that\ncollaborators believe will be useful to them in making progress on their agenda. All partners are also involved in\nthe scrutiny, visualization, discussion, and interpretation of data, and make joint decisions about how it should be\ndisseminated and used going forward. These efforts feed into next steps in both research and action.\n5. Ongoing collaboration. Such university-community partnerships typically last for many years. Researchers are\nthoughtful about how to bring them successfully to a close, making sure that an ongoing goal of the collaboration\nis to build capacity within the community partnership so members can sustain collective action after the research\nteam leaves.\nLifespan Developmental Research Methodologies | 37 A good way to become more familiar with these collaborative, inductive, and deductive research methods is to look at\njournal articles, which are written in sections that follow these steps in the scientific process. In general, the structure\nfollows: abstract (summary of the article), introduction or literature review, methods explaining how the study was\nconducted, results of the study, discussion and interpretation of findings, and references.\nMethods of Gathering Information\n\u201cMethods\u201d is also a name given to many different procedures scientists use to make their observations or collect\ninformation. Since developmentalists are interested in a wide range of human capacities, they want to know not\nonly about people\u2019s actions and thoughts, as expressed in words and deeds, but also about underlying processes, like\nabilities, emotions, desires, intentions, and motivations. Moreover, they want to go deeper, looking into biological and\nneurophysiological processes, and they want to consider many factors outside the person of study, looking at social\nrelationships and interactions, as well as environmental materials, tasks, and affordances, and societal contexts. And, as\nlifespan researchers, they want to study these capacities at all ages, from the tiniest babies to the oldest grandmothers.\nNo wonder developmental scientists need so many tools, and are inventing more all the time.\nEvery time you come across a conclusion in a textbook or research article, for example, when you read that \u201c18-month-\nolds do not yet have a sense of self,\u201d you should stop and ask, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d That is a great question. And\na great scientific attitude. Over and over, we will want to scrutinize the evidence scientists are using to make their\nconclusions, considering carefully the extent to which the methods scientists use justify the conclusions they make. If\na baby can\u2019t yet talk, how would we know whether they have a sense of self? And even when a child can talk, what is\nthe connection between what they are telling us and what they are truly thinking? You can be sure that these kinds of\nquestions stoke lively debates in scientific circles.\nAs with methodologies more generally, science is strengthened by the use of a variety of approaches to collecting\ninformation. The shortcomings of one can be compensated for by the strengths of others. If we find that a new mother\nsays that she is feeling stressed, and her best friend agrees, and we see elevated cortisol levels, and her survey results\nare higher than usual, and she becomes irritated when her two-year-old makes a mess\u2013 well, we think we have captured\nsomething meaningful here. We are always in favor of multiple sources of data, and we especially appreciate methods\nthat get us thick, rich information, as close to lived experience in context as possible.\nHere are some examples of methods commonly used in developmental research today:\nObservations: Looking at People and their Actions\nOften considered the basic building blocks of developmental science, observational methods are those in which the\nresearcher carefully watches participants, noting what they are doing, saying, and expressing, both verbally and\nnonverbally. Researchers can observe participants doing just about anything, including working on tasks, playing\nwith toys, reading the newspaper, or interacting with others. Observations are ideal for gathering information about\npeople\u2019s verbal and physical behavior, but it is less clear whether internal states, like emotions and intentions, can be\nunambiguously discerned through observation.\n\u2022 Naturalistic observations take place when researchers conduct observations in the regular settings of everyday\nlife. This method allows researchers to get very close to the phenomenon as it actually unfolds, but researchers\nworry that their participation may impact participants\u2019 behaviors (a problem called reactivity). And, since\nresearchers have little control over the environment, they realize that the different behaviors they observe may be\ndue to differences in situational factors.\n\u2022 Laboratory observations, in contrast, take place in a specialized setting created by the researcher, that is, the lab.\n38 | Lifespan Developmental Research Methodologies For example, researchers bring babies and their caregivers to the lab in a systematic procedure known as the\nstrange situation, which you will learn about in the section on attachment. Observing in the lab allows researchers\nto set up a specific space and to have control over situational factors. However, researchers worry that the\nartificial nature of the situation may have an impact on people\u2019s behavior, and that the behaviors people show in\nthe lab are not typical of the ones they show in regular contexts of daily life (a problem called generalizability).\n\u2022 Video or audio observations can be gathered using automatic recording devices that collect information even when\na researcher is not present. For example, researchers ask caregivers to record family dinners or teachers to tape\nclass sessions; or place a small recording device on a young child\u2019s chest that records every word the child says or\nhears. These records can then be watched or listened to by researchers. Such procedures reduce reactivity, but\nthe resultant recordings are narrower in scope than what researchers could hear or see if they were present\nobserving in the actual context.\n\u2022 Local expert observers can provide researchers with information about the verbal and non-verbal behavior of\nparticipants they have observed or interacted with many times. For example, caregivers and teachers can report\non their children and students, and even children can provide their perspectives. Reports from others typically\nincorporate many more observations than a researcher could collect (e.g., a teacher sees a child in class every\nweek day), so the information is more representative of the target\u2019s typical behavior. However, researchers worry\nthat information could be distorted, for example, because reporters are biased or are not trained to observe or\ncategorize the behaviors they have witnessed.\n\u2022 Participant observations, which are especially common in anthropology and sociology, take place when\nresearchers gain entrance into a setting, not as an observer, but as a participant, with the aim of gaining a close\nand intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals or a particular community, and their behaviors,\nrelationships, and practices. These observations are usually conducted over an extended period of time,\nsometimes months or years, which means that the observer can directly observe variations and changes in actions\nand interactions. Such observations provide rich and detailed information, but are limited to the specific setting.\nSelf-reports: Listening to People and their Thoughts\nWhen researchers are studying people, one of the most common ways of gathering information about them is by asking\nthem, via self-report methods. These can range from informal open-ended interviews or requests for participants to\nwrite responses to prompts, all the way to surveys, when participants can only choose among researcher-generated\noptions. Self-report data are ideal for learning about people\u2019s inner thoughts or opinions, but researchers worry that\nparticipants may distort the truth to present themselves in a favorable light (a problem called social desirability). There\nis also debate about whether participants have access to some of their internal processes, like their genuine motivations.\n\u2022 Surveys gather information using standardized questionnaires, which can be administered either verbally or in\nwriting. Surveys capture an enormous range of psychological and social processes, and their items can be tested\nfor their reliability and validity(called psychometric properties), but they typically yield only surface information.\nResearchers worry that participants may misinterpret questions and realize that the information so collected is\nrestricted to exactly those pre-packaged questions and responses.\n\u2022 Standardized, structured, or semi-structured interviews involve researchers directly asking a series of\npredetermined questions. Because researchers are present, they can ask follow up questions and participants can\nask for clarification. This allows researchers to learn more from participants than they could from standardized\nquestionnaires, but researchers worry that their presence could cause reactivity, such as when participants want\nto provide more socially desirable responses in a face-to-face setting than on an anonymous survey.\n\u2022 Open-ended interviews typically use targeted questions or prompts to get the conversation flowing, and then\nfollow the interview where ever it leads. This allows for more customized questioning and in-depth answers, as\nLifespan Developmental Research Methodologies | 39 researchers probe responses for greater clarity and understanding. However, since each respondent participates\nin a different interview conversation, it can be difficult to compare responses from person to person.\n\u2022 Focus groups involve group open-ended interviews, in which a small number of people (6-10) discuss a series of\nquestions or prompts in guided or open discussion with a trained facilitator. In this format, focus group members\nlisten and can react to each other\u2019s comments and build discussion at the group level.\n\u2022 Responses to prompts are used when researchers ask participants to write down their thoughts. These can range\nfrom relatively unstructured free writes to short answers to a series of well-structured questions. Daily diaries,\noften organized electronically, allow participants to respond to online questions or prompts many days in a row.\nPsychological Tests and Assessments: Mental Capacities and Conditions\nMost of us are familiar with tests that measure, for example, IQ or other mental abilities, and with diagnostic\nassessments that classify people according to psychological conditions. When you read about the aging of intelligence,\nfor example, some of those studies utilize measures of crystalized and fluid intelligence. Tests to measure mental\nabilities have been created for people of all ages, although it is not always clear how the measures used at different ages\nare connected to each other.\nLaboratory Tasks: Interactions that Elicit or Capture Psychological Processes\nResearchers create and invent all manner of tasks for participants to work on, either in the lab or in real life settings (e.g.,\nat home or school). These tasks allow researchers to set up activities that can assess a range of psychological attributes\nfor people of all ages, ranging from problem-solving abilities to regulatory capacities (e.g., using the \u201cHeads, Shoulders,\nKnees, and Toes\u201d task), prosocial behaviors, learned helplessness, theories of mind, social information processing,\nrejection sensitivity, and so on. Many YouTube videos show children and adolescents participating in these tasks, and\nit is instructive to try to figure out exactly what is captured in each one. If you would like to see an example, you can\nwatch a video of The Shopping Cart Study (not required, bonus information).\nPsychophysiological Assessment: Underlying Neurophysiological Functioning\nResearchers also use a range of methods to capture information about neurophysiological functioning across the\nlifespan, including technology that can measure heart rate, blood pressure, hormone levels, and many kinds of brain\nactivity to help explain development. These assessments provide information about what is happening \u201cunder the skin,\u201d\nand researchers can see how these biological processes are connected to behavioral development. Usually connections\nare bidirectional\u2013 neurophysiology contributes to the development of behavior, and behaviors shape physiological\nfunctioning and development.\nArchival Data or Artifacts: Information from Business as Usual\nResearchers sometimes utilize information that has already been collected as a regular part of daily life. Such data\ninclude, for example, students\u2019 grades and achievement tests scores, documents or other media, drawings, work\nproducts, or other materials that might provide information about participants\u2019 developmental progress or causal\nfactors contributing to their development. These kinds of data have the advantage of low reactivity and high\nauthenticity, in that they were created or gathered in the normal course of events, but it is sometimes unclear exactly\nwhat they mean or what constructs they measure.\nCase Study: All of the Above with Carefully Selected Participants or Settings\nOne of the best ways to gather in depth information about a person or group of people (e.g., a classroom, school,\nor neighborhood) is through a research methodology called the case study. Researchers focus on only one or a small\nnumber of target units, usually carefully selected for specific characteristics (e.g., an individual identified as wise, a\n40 | Lifespan Developmental Research Methodologies homeless teenager, a very effective school, or a workplace with high turnover rates), and amass everything they can\nabout that person or place. Researchers typically conduct in-depth open-ended interviews with people, including\nfriends or family of the target person, and collect archival data and artifacts, which they might discuss in depth with\nparticipants. For example, they might go through the person\u2019s photo albums and discuss memories of their early life.\nClassical examples of case studies are the so-called baby diaries, in which researchers like Jean Piaget and William\nStern conducted extensive observations on their individual children and took detailed notes about every aspect of their\nbehavior and development. They also tested some of their hypotheses about development, by giving their babies toys to\nplay with or engaging them in interesting tasks. These case studies were conducted over years. When case studies also\nextend into the past of the individual (for example, when researchers are interested in life review processes), they can\nbe called biographical methods.\nSometimes researchers who focus on a group of individuals or a setting are particularly interested in the cultural context\nand its functioning. These studies can be called ethnographies. Drawn originally from anthropology, ethnographic\nmethods describe an approach in which researchers carefully study and document people and their cultural settings,\nusually through extensive participant-observation, interviews, and engagement in the setting. In these studies, as in all\nscientific investigations, researchers are the students and the people in the setting are the teachers. Researchers strive\nto create a wholistic, higher-order narrative account that privileges the perspectives of the people studied.\nTake Home Messages about Lifespan Developmental Methodologies\nWe would highlight four main themes from this section:\n1. Because interventionists and practitioners use bodies of scientific evidence to transform systems and change\npractices in the world, it is crucial that researchers produce the highest quality evidence possible, and evaluate and\ncritique it thoughtfully.\n2. Developmental science incorporates multiple methodologies from many disciplines, and these deductive, inductive,\nand collaborative methodologies make our conclusions stronger because they provide complementary lines of\nsight on our target phenomena.\n3. Science is also strengthened by the use of a variety of approaches (or methods) for collecting information,\nincluding observations, self-reports, and other strategies, because together they provide a richer picture of our\ntarget developing phenomena.\n4. The advantages of using multiple methodologies and sources of information are highlighted by the idea of\n\u201cconverging operations,\u201d which points out that this practice allows the shortcomings of one method to be\ncompensated for by the strengths of others, and reminds us that bodies of evidence are stronger when findings\nfrom multiple complementary methodologies and sources of information converge on the same conclusions.\nAdapted from: Skinner, E.

From a lifespan perspective, developmental science has three primary\ngoals: to describe, explain, and optimize human development (Baltes, Reese, & Nesselroade, 1977; see Table 1.1). Because\nthese goals are embedded within the larger meta-theory created by the lifespan perspective, they target two kinds of\ndevelopment: (1) patterns of normative change and stability; and (2) patterns of differential change and stability. When\nresearchers say they are interested in understanding normative stability and change, they mean typical or regular age-\ngraded patterns of individual change and constancy. When researchers want to understand differential development,\nthey mean the different pathways that people can follow over time, including differences in the amount, nature, and\ndirection of change. Moreover, researchers understand that some development entails quantitative changes (often called\n\u201ctrajectories\u201d) and others involve qualitative shifts, such as the reorganization of existing forms or the emergence of\nnew forms.\nDescription is the most basic task for all scientists. For developmental scientists, description involves depicting,\nportraying, or representing patterns of development in their target phenomena. This includes description of normative\ndevelopment, or typical quantitative and qualitative age-graded changes and continuities, as well as identifying the\nvariety of different quantitative and qualitative pathways the phenomena can take. Explanations refer to explicit\naccounts of the factors that cause, influence, or produce the patterns of changes and stability that have been described.\nThese are completely different from descriptions themselves. Descriptions answer questions like \u201cwhat?\u201d (i.e., the nature\nof the target phenomena), \u201chow?\u201d (i.e., the ways in which phenomena can change or remain the same), and \u201cwhen?\u201d (i.e.,\nthe ways in which these patterns appear as a function of age or time), whereas explanations focus on \u201cwhy?\u201d.\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 43 The goal of optimization refers to research and intervention activities designed to figure out how to promote healthy\ndevelopment (also referred to as flourishing or thriving) and the development of resilience. This task goes beyond\ndescription and explanation in two ways. First, in order to optimize development, trajectories and pathways must be\nidentified as targets\u2014targets that represent \u201coptimal\u201d development. These kinds of trajectories are often better than\nnormative development, and so represent rare or even imaginary pathways, especially for groups living in highly risky\nenvironments. The search for optimal pathways reflects the assumption that individuals hold much more potential and\nplasticity in their development than is typically expressed or observed. The second way that optimization goes beyond\ndescription and explanation is that even when explanatory theories and research have identified all the conditions\nneeded to promote optimal development, researchers and interventionists must still discover the strategies and levers\nthat can consistently bring about these developmental conditions. One way to understand the difference between\nexplanation and optimization is that, if explanations focus on the antecedents of a developmental phenomenon, then\noptimization efforts focus on the antecedents of these antecedents.\nTo learn more about these three goals, have a look at the expanded reading at this link.\nDescribe, Explain, Optimize [pdf]\nGoals of Lifespan Developmental Science\n1.

These included cross-sectional, longitudinal, and\nsequential designs. Explanatory designs refer to how and where data are collected, so they include experimental vs.\nnaturalistic (or correlational) designs, and data collected in laboratory vs. field settings. As a result, designs combine\nall three of these features, for example, researchers conduct longitudinal field experiments, cross-sectional lab\nexperiments, and naturalistic longitudinal field studies. In the next sections, these kinds of designs are explained in more\ndetail.\nKinds of Study Designs: When, How, and Where Are Data Collected?\nCross-\nWhen?

There are two simple developmental designs: cross-sectional and longitudinal.\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 45 Why is it challenging to figure how people differ or change with age?\nIt is challenging because people\u2019s lives are always embedded in historical time. As soon as a person is born, he or she\nis inserted into a specific historical moment. And, as the person ages and changes, society is changing right along with\nthem. For example, if you were born in 1990, I know exactly how old you were when the Twin Towers fell, when the Great\nRecession hit, and when iTunes opened. From a research design perspective, we can say that peoples\u2019 development is\nconfounded with historical changes (that is, with the specific historical events and general societal trends that occur\nduring their lifetimes). The problem with either of the simple developmental designs is that they do not allow clear\ninferences about (1) whether differences between age groups are really due to age or to historical differences, or (2)\nwhether changes in people over time are really due to age changes or to historical changes. That is why lifespan\nresearchers need to use designs that give them more information than simple cross-sectional or longitudinal studies\ndo, such as sequential designs.\nCan you remind me about the cross-sectional design?\nA CROSS-SECTIONAL DESIGN collects information (1) at one point in time (one time of measurement) on (2) groups of\npeople who are different ages.\nDesign for a cross-sectional (CS) study: (1) conducted in 1960, using (2) six age groups:\nTIME of MEASUREMENT\n1960\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nCS\nThe good news about cross-sectional studies is that we get information about a wide range of age differences in a\nshort period of time (one time of measurement), and we get information about differences between groups of people of\ndifferent ages.\nFrom a developmental perspective, however, the bad news about cross-sectional studies is that we don\u2019t get any\ninformation about the thing we are most interested in, that is, change. Cross sectional studies provide no information (1)\nabout how people change, (2) about pathways (or trajectories) different people take; or (3) about how earlier events or\nexperiences predict later functioning.\nWhat is the problem with cross-sectional designs?\nThe problem is that you CANNOT infer that differences between the age groups are the same as age changes.\nWhy not?\nBecause differences between age groups could be generational differences. What looks like age differences could really\nbe cohort differences. Generational cohorts are groups of people who were born at the same time. They are sometimes\n46 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs just called \u201cgenerations\u201d and have been given labels, like the baby boomers, generation X, the millennial generation, and\nso on.\nWhat are COHORT effects?\n\u201cCohort effects\u201d are the lifelong effects of belonging to a specific generation. They reflect the idea that being born at a\nspecific time influences your development. Each of us has a series of experiences based on growing up during a specific\nhistorical period. Cohort effects also reflect the idea that specific historical events and trends have a different impact\non people depending on how old they are. The Great Recession may have a very different effect on your development if\nyou were 8 or 18 or 28 or 80. \u201cCohort effects\u201d are the idea that people\u2019s developmental pathways may differ based on the\ncumulative effects of these differences in experiences. If you want to learn more about different generations, you could\nwatch this video about Generations throughout History (not required, bonus information).\nWhat problem does that create for cross-sectional designs?\nThe problem is that the people in the different age groups also belong to different cohorts. In cross-sectional studies\nage is always confounded with cohort. Differences between the groups COULD be age differences or they COULD be\ncohort differences. You can see this confounding in the cross-sectional study depicted below. The participants who are\n30 also belong to the 1930 birth cohort; the participants who are 40 also belong to the 1920 birth cohort, and so on. If\nwe know the person\u2019s age and the time of measurement, we can figure out their birth cohort.\nCOHORT TIMES of MEASUREMENT\n1960\n1930 30\n1920 40\n1910 50\n1900 60\n1890 70\n1880 80\nCS\nDevelopmental researchers want to know if people differ according to their ages. But the fatal flaw with cross-sectional\nstudies is that any differences between the groups in this design could be EITHER age differences OR generational\n(cohort) differences. Ages are completely confounded with cohorts (years of birth or generations). Any cross-sectional\nstudy could also be called an intergenerational study.\nWhat is a LONGITUDINAL design?\nIt\u2019s a study that examines (1) one group of people (2) repeatedly over multiple time points. Here is a longitudinal (LONG)\nstudy design that includes six times of measurement:\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 47 COHORT TIMES of MEASUREMENT\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n1950 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60 -> LONG\n1940\n1930\n1920\n1910\n1900\n1890\n1880\nThe good news about a longitudinal study is that it provides information about how people CHANGE or DEVELOP, as\nwell as information about different people\u2019s pathways or trajectories. It also allows researchers to see whether earlier\nexperiences or events predict later outcomes.\nBUT\u2013 are these really age changes?\nMaybe, but they could also be historical changes. The fatal flaw with longitudinal studies is that changes in people over\ntime could be EITHER due to age changes OR historical changes between times of measurement. As people age, the\nhistorical time they inhabit changes right along with them. Age and time of measurement are completely confounded,\nbecause all lives are embedded in historical time.\nTIMES of MEASUREMENT\n1 2 2 3 4 5\nCOHORT\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n1950 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60 -> LONG\n1940\n1930\n1920\n1910\n1900\n1890\n1880\n48 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs Can you see that age change is confounded with historical change in this longitudinal study? People who were 10 were\nalso living in 1960, when they were 20, they were living in 1970, and so on. So, when people were changing from age 10\nto age 20, the society they were living in also changed from 1960 to 1970. Therefore, people\u2019s changes COULD be due to\nage (i.e., development), OR they could be due to historical changes over the times during which data were collected, or\nboth.\nIf the simple developmental designs don\u2019t work, what kinds of designs can developmental researchers use?\nSEQUENTIAL designs are one good answer. They allow researchers to look at BOTH age changes and historical changes\nfor multiple cohorts. There are many kinds of sequential designs. The one that we will learn about is called a Cross-\nsequential design. It provides the most developmental information in the shortest amount of time. It allows researchers\nto look at differences between people in terms of cohorts, and also to examine historical changes.\nSimple Developmental Designs: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Fatal Flaws\nCross-sectional\nAdvantages \u2022 Provides an overview of age differences\n\u2022 Suggests windows where changes may be occurring\n\u2022 Quick & inexpensive to conduct\nFatal Flaw \u2022 What looks like age differences could really be cohort or generational differences (confound)\nDisadvantages \u2022 Pattern of age differences might not hold at other times of measurement (generalizability)\n\u2022 No information about age changes or effects of early experiences\nLongitudinal\nAdvantages \u2022 Provides information about actual change with age\n\u2022 Shows how people can develop differentially\n\u2022 Reveals connections between early and later development\nFatal Flaw \u2022 What looks like age changes could really be historical changes (confound)\nDisadvantages \u2022 Pattern of age changes might not hold for other cohorts (generalizability)\n\u2022 Have to deal with effects of repeated testing and drop out\n\u2022 Measures are also aging, may be obsolete\n\u2022 Expensive and time consuming to conduct\nWhat is a CROSS-SEQUENTIAL design?\nCross-sequential designs combine cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. A cross-sequential study starts with a\ncross-sectional study that the researcher then follows up longitudinally for multiple measurement points. Here is a\ncross-sequential design (in green) that has 3 times of measurement, with 3 cross-sections (shown in the bottom row in\nyellow) and 8 longitudinal sequences (shown in the last column in blue).\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 49 TIMES of MEASUREMENT\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nCOHORT\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n1950 10 -> 20 -> 30 LONG- 1\n1940 20 -> 30 -> 40 LONG -2\n1930 30 -> 40 -> 50 LONG- 3\n1920 40 -> 50 -> 60 LONG- 4\n1910 50 -> 60 -> 70 LONG- 5\n1900 60 -> 70 -> 80 LONG- 6\n1890 70 -> 80 -> 90 LONG- 7\n1880 80 -> 90 -> 100 LONG- 8\nCS-1 CS-2 CS-3\nThe good news about a cross-sequential study is that this allows the researcher to compare longitudinal sequences\nacross the same ages for different cohorts. So, for example, the researcher can compare what it\u2019s like to go from age 20\nto age 30 from 1960 to 1970 (LONG-2) with what it\u2019s like to go from age 20 to age 30 from 1970 to 1980 (LONG-1). This\nway, the researcher can determine whether changes were due to age or tocohort differences.\nThis design also allows you to see if people who are the same age but from different cohorts are different from each\nother. For example, whether the 30-year-olds from the 1950 cohort are different from the 30-year-olds from the 1940\ncohort or the 1930 cohort. If the age groups do not differ, you can zip the different longitudinal sequences together:\nTIMES of MEASUREMENT\n1 2 3\nCOHORT\n1960 1970 1980\n1950 10 -> 20 -> 30 LONG- 1\n1 2 3\n1940 20 -> 30 -> 40 LONG -2\n1 2 3\n1930 30 -> 40 -> 50 LONG- 3\n1 2 3\n1920 40 -> 50 -> 60 LONG- 4\n1910 50 -> 60 -> 70 LONG- 5\n1900 60 -> 70 -> 80 LONG- 6\n1890 70 -> 80 -> 90 LONG- 7\n1880 80 -> 90 -> 100 LONG- 8\nCS-1 CS-2 CS-3\nIn this way, you can get imaginary long-term longitudinal information pretty quickly. That\u2019s why the cross-sequential\n50 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs design is also called an \u201caccelerated longitudinal design\u201d or the \u201cmost efficient design.\u201d The bad news about cross-\nsequential designs is that they are complex to conduct and to analyze.\nDo SEQUENTIAL DESIGNS get rid of all the problems with developmental designs?\nNo, but they do allow you to look at them. It may be that age differences ARE generational differences or that age\nchanges ARE shaped by historical changes.\nIf you are a contextualist, that\u2019s the phenomenon you are actually interested in. However, you may need a historian to\nmake sense of historical and cohort effects, and you may need to collect historical information as you go.\n1. SIMPLE DEVELOPMENTAL DESIGNS: Have their problems, but:\n1a. Cross-sectional.\nQuick overview of possible age differences.\nHelpful in collecting initial information about a new area of study because it can show where the developmental\naction might be.\nMay be okay if there aren\u2019t big cohort differences (e.g., in one-year age increments in school).\nCan repeat the CS study again soon to see if it replicates.\n1b. Longitudinal.\nGood for developmentalists.\nHelpful if you want to see age changes.\nHelpful if you want to see different pathways or trajectories.\nHelpful if you want to see how early events shape later development.\n2. SEQUENTIAL DESIGNS: Most complete information.\n2a. Cross-sequential.\nGood for developmentalists because it does provide longitudinal data.\nCan see if age changes replicate over cohorts.\nBecause of zipping, they do not take your whole life.\nAllows you to locate transition points and beginnings.\nThen you can focus on where interesting changes are taking place.\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 51 Explaining Development: Experimental and Naturalistic Designs\nDescription is the task of depicting, portraying, or representing patterns of development in the target phenomena,\nincluding patterns of normative age-graded changes and continuities, as well as the variety of different quantitative\nand qualitative pathways. In contrast, explanation refers to an account of the causes that together are sufficient to\nproduce the patterns of changes and stability that we have described: What sets of factors cause, influence, or produce\nthese different patterns of normative and differential change or stability over time? Explanation focuses on the weighty\nquestion of \u201cWhy?\u201d.\nGoals of Explanatory Studies in Lifespan Development\nBasically, explanatory studies are trying to answer two questions:\n\u2022 What are the causes of normative and differential patterns of development as they unfold in the actual contexts of daily life?\n\u2022 What are the mechanisms by which those causes exert their effects in shaping development?\nOf the many features of research designs, the ones most relevant to explanation refer to the \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of\ncollecting data, so next we consider studies that use experimental and naturalistic designs conducted in the lab and\nfield. In order to answer the causal questions of interest to lifespan developmental researchers, we want to create\ndesigns that allow us to make valid inferences about causes and effects as they unfold in the actual contexts of daily\nlife. This is the information we will need to take with us into our optimization efforts. Let\u2019s consider the four possible\ncombinations of designs and settings (see Table below), one at a time.\nCombinations of Settings and Designs.\nSettings\nDesigns Laboratory Setting Field Setting\nExperimental design 1. Lab experiments 3. Field experiments\nNaturalistic design 2. Naturalistic lab studies 4. Naturalistic field studies\nLABORATORY EXPERIMENTS\nWhat is an experimental design?\nThe defining features of an experimental design are twofold. The researcher (1) decides exactly what the causal agent\n(treatment) will be, and (2) determines who will get it (treatment group) and who will not (control group). So the\nchallenges are also twofold: (1) to create a beautiful package of causal agents and (2) to ensure that the treatment and\ncontrol groups are identical on everything but the treatment. Creating a plausible treatment that contains the causal\ningredient is always an art, but researchers have become increasingly sophisticated in (1) isolating the putative cause\nby creating control groups who receive every single part of the experience of the treatment group except the specified\ncausal agent; and (2) ensuring that control groups are identical to the treatment group on preexisting attributes, both\n52 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs known (which can be equated via matching or controlling for measured attributes) and unknown (which can be equated\nvia random assignment; Campbell & Stanley, 1963; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002).\nIn many design classes, you will learn that the best design (and some will say the only design) for demonstrating\ncausality is the experiment. So, for some researchers, the experiment (and not the time machine) is considered the \u201cgold\nstandard.\u201d And, in the olden days, it was often assumed that experiments only happen in the laboratory, so experimental\ndesigns and laboratory settings are often merged in students\u2019 minds. So let\u2019s take a minute to consider experiments in\nlabs.\nDo labs provide advantages for detecting causality?\nIndeed they do. They cannot be beat for settings in which the researcher has complete control over both key design\nfeatures. Researchers can ensure that assignment to experimental or control conditions is completely random; and they\ncan guarantee that the hypothesized causal variable is administered exactly as prescribed. Labs also provide very clear\nlines of sight on our phenomena\u2014both potential causes and potential effects.\nDo lifespan developmental researchers care about random assignment?\nYes. Huge problems are created by the fact that in the contexts of daily life people are not randomly assigned to causal\nconditions\u2014there are particular personal characteristics that belong to the people who get in the way of particular\ncausal forces, or who participate in them directly. And so, if we are going to distinguish pre-existing conditions that\nlaunched someone on a particular developmental trajectory from the causal factors that we are interested in discerning,\nwe have to create groups that are \u201cthe same on everything\u201d before we start our causal show. Randomized assignment is\none strategy to accomplish this, as well as its more systematic options, such as block randomization (randomly assigning\ndifferent categories of people), matching, propensity score matching, and so on.\nWhy are we so excited about exact control of the causal factor?\nWell, that\u2019s the magic of experimental designs. The researcher is like the fairy godmother who waves her wand and\nintroduces the potentially new future for the treatment group. So the researcher knows that the treatment group got the\npotential causal factor, and how much of the factor, and so on. And then the researcher has approximately a bazgillion\ncontrol groups, who got shades of everything but the hypothesized active ingredient. These can be very creative, the\ncontrol group with nothing, with only attention, with a visit to the lab but no causal factor, with a causal factor that looks\nlike the actual causal factor but really isn\u2019t. Remember \u201cplacebos,\u201d which were added to drug trials so that the control\ngroup even gets the experience of taking a pill?\nNATURALISTIC LAB STUDIES\nAre there lab studies that do not involve experiments?\nYes. They are called naturalistic lab studies because researchers bring participants into the lab setting, but do not\nadminister a dose of a potential causal agent.\nWhat would be some uses for naturalistic lab studies?\nOne important use is to measure constructs that you can\u2019t capture outside of the lab. There are some phenomena of\ngreat interest that are not visible without specialized instrumentation or procedures that can be administered only in\nthe lab setting. All manner of neurophysiological constructs can only be measured in the lab using complex equipment,\nlike fMRI, as well as the assessment of internal states and capacities, like executive function or delay of gratification or\nimplicit bias. Researchers can work with their participants in the lab in order to make these internal processes more\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 53 visible. One great example is the \u201ctalk aloud protocol,\u201d in which individuals (even children) are trained to narrate their\nmental processes as they work on a task or watch a demonstration. These protocols provide stream of consciousness\ninformation that would not be accessible in any other way.\nA second important reason researchers might turn to lab settings is to create conditions where they can trigger and\nthen observe interactions that are relatively rare in field settings. For example, research on learned helplessness often\nbrings children into controlled settings where researchers can watch them work with solvable and then with unsolvable\npuzzles, mazes, and concept tasks, while monitoring their strategies, efforts, and actions over time. (And, of course\nthey always end with success experiences.) Another example is the Strange Situation in which researchers trigger the\nattachment system in the living-room-like lab setting, by sending in a stranger and asking the caregiver to leave, and\nthen observing the child\u2019s actions.\nThese experiences are both rigorously standardized and intuitively compelling for participants. They can simulate\ntransgressions (e.g., when a child hears a child in the next room knock over her block creation), competitions (e.g., when\ntwo children are playing a videogame and one messes up), exclusion (e.g., when a child is left out of a ball tossing game),\nand so on. Such standardization creates comparability among participants. It allows researchers to be sure that their\ndifferential responses are not due to differential provocations, but to their individual reactions to identical experiences.\nIn all these cases, naturalistic observation may seem more desirable, but social processes can be impossible to tease\napart as they unfold in daily contexts. For example, mastery-oriented children run into fewer tasks they cannot solve\nthan helpless-prone children and so it is harder to catch them in failure situations, and in schools teachers do not assign\nimpossible tasks, and so observers could go for weeks without seeing their phenomena. And, by the way, after about five\nyears of age, kids are busy trying to hide their true reactions to negative events (a phenomenon called \u201cmasking\u201d), which\nmakes it harder for observers to actually detect undesired states (like anxiety or boredom) in the field. In fact, precisely\nbecause people and their contexts are so intertwined, we sometimes bring our participants into the lab to see what they\ncan do without the scaffolds or interference of social partners.\nWhat are the main advantages of experimental and naturalistic lab studies?\nTheir claims to fame are control and precision. Because we have exact control of the causal factor and exact control\nover who receives it, we can make unambiguous causal inferences. These may be especially appreciated when we\nare trying to untangle the directions of effects in reciprocal proximal processes or transactions. Moreover, we have\nprecision in our measurement or observation of the targets\u2014both causes and effects. We can see below the surface (into\nneurophysiology or cognitive functioning). We can even trigger phenomena that are rare or hard to see in the wild, and\nrecord their details using our video cameras or talk aloud protocols.\nWhat are the disadvantages of studies conducted in lab settings?\nWell, for lifespan developmental researchers, they have some pretty serious limitations. Let\u2019s think about three big\nones. First, labs and fields are more than settings to us. They are contexts. And contexts are not just geographic\nand architectural locations, in the sense that you can simply pick people up and \u201cset\u201d them down in new places.\nContexts have tentacles that reach out and wind themselves around people, and people have roots that reach down into\nplaces. They are connected, mutually created, interpenetrated even, so that our most likely causal forces, our proximal\nprocesses, cannot even be constituted when we look at only one without the other. When researchers split the child\nfrom his or her context, it destroys the phenomenon itself, like removing the heart from the body in order to see how\nit works. You can\u2019t. Once you remove it, it doesn\u2019t work anymore. So we worry that lab studies can alter or distort our\nphenomena.\nSo developmentalists don\u2019t conduct research in laboratory settings?\nNot at all. Contextualists are just very wary about the idea of the \u201csetting\u201d and very aware of what is lost by leaving\n54 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs the \u201cscene of the crime,\u201d that is, the contexts of daily life. The \u201cfield\u201d is an intrinsic and crucial part of the target we are\ntrying to understand, and if we are going to bring our whole phenomenon into the lab, we have to know all the relevant\nelements of the context and effectively simulate them in the lab. Otherwise, this kind of distortion can be a threat to\ninternal validity.\nWhat is the second limitation of laboratory studies?\nSecond, we assume that all our causal factors are embedded in contexts and shaped by them. Instead of thinking about\nthe lab as a place where researchers can get more pristine information about their target phenomena (the child and\ntheir behavior), the lab has come to be regarded as one context with its own attributes (e.g., novelty) and set of social\npartners (i.e., the experimenter) that are exerting their own effects on the child. So if we are looking at the functioning\nof proximal processes in the lab, we can be sure that the lab context is shaping then, which means we can\u2019t be sure that\nthey actually operate the same way in the contexts of daily life. As a result, we always have to admit that any causal links\nwe may have created in the lab have to be couched as \u201ccan cause\u201d our target and not as \u201cdoes cause\u201d our target. We have\nto wait and see if these same processes are operating in the actual contexts that form the natural microsystems for our\nparticipants. Otherwise, this kind of artificiality can be a threat to external validity.\nThird, the time span over which developmentalists assume that causal effects accumulate cannot be easily simulated\nin the lab. The causal processes of interest to developmentalists unfold over months and years and decades, across\nmultiple contexts, so although we can use the lab to measure the long-term effects of causal factors by bringing our\nparticipants back to the lab as many times as we want to, if we want to actually lookat the causal processes having their\neffects over months or years, it will be difficult to achieve that in the lab setting.\nAnd are there corresponding disadvantages with experimental designs?\nWell, for some developmentalists, they do have a fatal flaw. As noted by many methodologists, the seemingly\ninsurmountable problem with experimental designs is that it is not possible to randomly assign or manipulate the causal\nforces that are of biggest interest to developmentalists. No one can randomly assign their participants to a particular\nage group (\u201cI have flipped a coin and you will be in the five-year-old group\u201d \u201cOh no, I wanted to be 10!\u201d) or to a particular\ncohort or developmental history.\nIn fact, most of the causal factors that are of interest to us can\u2019t ethically be manipulated at all\u2014the happy single-\nparent family versus the unhappily married parents, the delinquent peer group versus theatre-obsessed friends, school\nfailure versus success, peer rejection versus popularity, high stress reactivity, dangerous neighborhoods, or height.\nBefore you ask, we will just add that this same issue applies to all areas of psychology. Many applied problems cannot\nbe manipulated\u2014divorce, PTSD, dangerous job conditions, psychopathology, work-family conflict, serious medical\ndiagnosis, intimate partner violence, and so on. So there are serious limitations to how much experimental designs can\nhelp applied researchers study the conditions and causes that matter most to them.\nFIELD EXPERIMENTS\nWait! What about field experiments designed to promote development?\nYes, indeed. And these field experiments can even be conducted as randomized controlled trials (RCTs; Shadish & Cook,\n2009). And, yes, we can ethically study any old target we please as long as we are trying to promote development\u2014to\nremediate unfavorable developmental trajectories, to maintain resilient ones, and in general to prevent adverse and\npromote healthy development.\nWhat are randomized controlled trials?\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 55 As you may know, this methodology was borrowed from clinical trials of medical treatments, and it is cool in many ways.\nIt has time in its design, which is always welcome news to developmentalists. RCTs compare (at least) two groups who\nshould be equivalent to each other (based on random assignment), one of which has received the treatment and the\nother a placebo, so that researchers can examine the effects of the treatment over and above the effects of knowing that\none is being treated. Then after a sufficient amount of time for the treatment to do its work, changes in the treatment\nand control group can be compared over however many time points the design includes. In recent decades, RCTs in field\nsettings have become de rigueur for settling causal claims about \u201cevidence-based\u201d practices, programs, and policies.\nRCT field experiments provide a standard of proof that has made them essential to both the scientific community and\nto applied decision makers and stakeholders (e.g., see the What Works Clearinghouse).\nDo these kinds of studies have certain advantages?\nIndeed, they do. Some researchers see field experiments as the best of both worlds. On the one hand, studies get to keep\nall the compelling features of experimental designs that are so helpful in making unambiguous causal inferences. But on\nthe other hand, we have escaped from the lab setting and returned to the contexts of everyday life, so they generally\nevince higher authenticity and external validity. Often treatments are even administered by natural social partners in\neveryday contexts. Parents, teachers, bosses, coaches, or mentors receive systematic training and then bring their newly\nacquired attributes back into the settings of homes, classrooms, and workplaces, where researchers can determine\nwhether they subsequently change the proximal processes and the development that takes place there.\nAre there disadvantages to field experiments?\nMany researchers consider RCTs to be \u201cthe gold standard,\u201d but they have three important limitations for\ndevelopmentalists. First, the very thing we like about them\u2014getting out of the lab and into the field\u2014can make the\nadministration of the causal factor somewhat messy. We lose some of our beloved control and precision. Especially if\nresearchers decide that the treatment (often an intervention program) will be administered through intermediaries (like\nteachers or caregivers or social workers), it can be a giant headache. A whole area of study, called \u201cimplementation\nresearch,\u201d focuses on \u201cimplementation fidelity\u201d\u2014or how to make sure that participants actually make contact with the\nactive ingredients of the potential causal factor.\nMoreover, in the real world, participants can drop out of the treatment (e.g., the teacher or parent training) any time they\nwant, but they do not drop out of the treatment group in our design. To maintain the equivalence between treatment\nand control groups accomplished by our initial random assignment, participants cannot voluntarily switch groups\u2014or\nwe have suddenly introduced bias. So the treatment group is often labeled the \u201cintent to treat\u201d group, meaning that\nparticipants were initially assigned to this group, even if they end up receiving no treatment whatsoever. It\u2019s like doctors\nwho send the treatment pills home with their patients and then hope for the best, but never get to count the pills that\nare left in the bottle at the end of the trial. If patients do not improve, they can\u2019t really say whether the drug didn\u2019t work\nor whether the patients just didn\u2019t take their pills. Unsettling from a causal inference perspective.\nA second limitation, and one that field experiments share with lab experiments, is that they cannot tell us what caused\nthese unhealthy pathways of development in the first place, any more than studying aspirin can tell us what causes\nheadaches or how to prevent them. So additional work will always be needed to fill in the causal puzzle of the factors\nthat contribute to and maintain non-optimal development or lead to psychopathology. Such studies would be essential\nto prevention efforts.\nThird, RCTs (in both lab and field) have inherent limitations in providing causal explanations. At the end of the day, the\nonly thing that this design can tell you is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d That is, the only information it yields is whether the two groups\u2013\ntreatment and control\u2013 are different. You can add many features, for example, many indicators of disease or health, you\ncan measure dosage and its effects, over several time periods, and so on. However, developmentalists would say that,\nafter all this work, the only thing we have in our hands is a causal description but not the thing that we most want, that\n56 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs is, a causal explanation. For the drug companies, everything they want to know about causal explanations is contained\nin the drug itself. To the extent that they care about how the drug works, its mechanisms of effects have already been\nstudied (and of course, we take many drugs that are effective, but whose mechanisms of effects are unknown).\nBut as developmentalists, our interventions contain hundreds of potential active ingredients. And so we want to poke\nour heads under the hood and look all around, watching the cogs engage and the wheels turn. We want to watch the\ntennis game or the dance, and see who is hitting the ball the hardest and how the players adapt to each other\u2019s style\nover time and who is playing the music. In other words, we are on the trail of causal explanation and so we can\u2019t really\nbe satisfied with \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d We will forever be asking \u201cWhy?\u201d or \u201cWhy not?\u201d and especially \u201cHow did that work?\u201d.\nSo we will always be supplementing experimental and lab studies, and even RCT studies, with studies using designs\nthat can provide us with more complex process-oriented accounts of the multiple causes of differential developmental\ntrajectories and transformations.\nTake Home Messages about Different Explanatory Designs and Settings\nAll designs, including experimental lab and field designs, have advantages and disadvantages (see Table). Your job is to\nconduct each kind of study using the very best methods available (that\u2019s the \u201clooking\u201d part of a scientist\u2019s role) and\nthen to keep straight on what you can and cannot see (that\u2019s the \u201cthinking\u201d part of a scientist\u2019s role). That way, you will\nlearn what there really is to be learned using experimental designs, and then start longing for what can be seen using\nalternative designs that provide other lines of sight.\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 57 Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Settings and Designs\nLaboratory Advantages Control and precision\nExperiment\nUnambiguous causal inference.\nPrecise control of hypothesized causal factor.\nPrecise measure of hypothesized effect.\nTreatment and control group are the same on known and unknown attributes (potential\nconfounders).\nDisadvantages Artificiality\nMay change phenomena.\nLimited to \u201ccan cause\u201d versus \u201cdoes cause\u201d causal conclusions.\nMay or may not work in actual contexts.\nMany potential causal factors cannot be manipulated.\nNaturalistic Advantages Precision\nLaboratory Study\nMeasure constructs that are \u201cbelow the surface\u201d (e.g., neurophysiology, capacities,\nknowledge).\nCan observe proximal processes more closely.\nCan observe proximal processes without typical scaffolding or interference of social\npartners.\nCan trigger phenomenon that are rare or masked in the field.\nDisadvantages Distortion\nSplitting of person from context may have destroyed causal factors.\nHard to locate \u201cactive ingredient\u201d of causal packages.\nArtificiality and novelty of context, instrument, or trigger distorts causal phenomena.\nField Advantages Control and Actual context\nExperiment\nPotential for causal inference.\nPotential to see how causes operate in situ.\nPotential to see effects in situ.\nDisadvantages Messiness\nHard to precisely control the implementation of the potential causal factor.\n58 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs Especially if delivery agents are also naturalistic (i.e., caregivers, teachers, social workers).\nLimited to \u201ccan cause\u201d versus \u201cdoes cause\u201d causal conclusions.\nMost potential causal factors cannot be manipulated.\nLimited account of causal process.\nNaturalistic Advantages Authenticity\nField Study\nWhole phenomenon is intact.\nCan discover causes that were not expected.\nDisadvantages Murkiness\nHard to specify \u201cactive ingredient\u201d of causal packages.\nImpossible to control all selection effects.\nLimited to \u201cmay cause\u201d versus \u201cdoes cause\u201d causal conclusions.\nNATURALISTIC FIELD STUDIES\nWhat we appreciate about naturalistic field studies is obvious from the limitations we encountered with lab and\nexperimental designs: In naturalistic studies we can examine the effects of potential causes we can\u2019t possibly administer\n(e.g., maltreatment, ability tracking, peer rejection). Moreover, we can watch these processes operate in their authentic\nmulti-level contexts, and we can follow them for months and years.\nBut aren\u2019t experiments the only way to show causality?\nYes, experiments can provide important evidence of causal processes. But let\u2019s consider the kinds of causal evidence\nthat can be provided by naturalistic studies.\nAre we talking about correlational studies? Because we know for a fact that \u201ccorrelation does not prove causation.\u201d\nRight, it is correct that correlation by itself does not prove causation. But let\u2019s take a minute to understand why\nthis is true, and then to see whether there are some things that researchers can do to improve the designs of\ntheir studies so that naturalistic studies, using more than correlations, can provide evidence about causes. Because,\nremember\u2014correlation may not prove causation, but causal processes do generate correlations: Since causes produce\neffects, effects covary with their causes. In fact, this covariation is a defining condition of causality (see box). As a result,\ncorrelations (or covariation or contingencies, however you want to label them) may be the smoke that leads us to our\ncausal fires. The problem is that many things besides causation lead to correlations, and so we have to work hard to\ndecipher the causal evidence among all the other kinds of covariation information we are examining.\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 59 John Stuart Mill (1843) on causality\nTo establish causality, three basic conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The presumed effects(s) must covary with their presumed cause(s);\n\u2022 The presumed cause(s) must precede their effects in time; and\n\u2022 All other plausible alternative explanations for the effect must be excluded.\nOkay, can you break down the reasons that correlations do not prove causation?\nYes, let\u2019s start with a consideration of a typical correlation between two variables, and let\u2019s pick variables that tap\nconstructs we think could be causally connected, say, teacher involvement and student engagement (see figure below).\nLet\u2019s say that in this research we get a robust correlation between good measures of both variables. Why can\u2019t we\nconclude that teacher involvement influences student engagement? There are two main reasons. First, as also shown\nin the figure below, the connection between these two variables could be due to a reciprocal causal effect, in which\nstudent engagement influences teacher involvement. This direction of effects is conceptually plausible, since more\nengaged students could attract more positive teacher attention whereas more disaffected students could lead teachers\nto withdraw or treat students more harshly. Of course, the correlation could be due to both feedforward (i.e., teachers\u2019\ninfluences on students) and feedback (i.e., students\u2019 influences on teachers) effects.\nThe second possibility is that there is no causal effect at\nall between these two variables (forward or backward).\nInstead, they are both actually produced by a completely\ndifferent cause (the ominously named \u201cthird variable\u201d);\nand they covary only because they are both effects from\nthe same cause. In our example, also shown in the figure,\nwe selected students\u2019 gender as our third variable\nbecause gender is a plausible cause of both variables. In\ngeneral, girls are more engaged and teachers show more\ninvolvement with them, whereas boys generally tend to\nbe less engaged and teachers show less warmth toward\nthem. In this scenario, as in all other scenarios involving\nconcurrent correlations, there are a very large number of\nFigure 2.2 third variables (alternative causes of both) that could be in\nplay\u2014it could be achievement (engaged students perform\nbetter in school and teachers attend more to high performing students) or social class or student sense of\nrelatedness\u2014as well as a large number of third variables that we can\u2019t immediately imagine. So in naturalistic designs,\nwe use the term \u201cthird variable\u201d as shorthand for all the alternative causal explanations that could underlie the\nconnections between our hypothesized antecedent and its possible consequence.\nIs there anything we can do to help solve these problems?\nYes, including time in the design of our naturalistic studies helps us out quite a bit.\nWhat do you mean by \u201cadding time\u201d to a design?\nWhen we say we are \u201cadding time\u201d to a design, we mean that we are adding \u201coccasions\u201d or \u201ctimes of measurement\u201d or\n\u201crepeated measures\u201d to a design.\nLike in a longitudinal study?\n60 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs Yes, but maybe the most general description is \u201ctime series\u201d because the design includes a series of different times of\nmeasurement.\nWhat are the advantages of adding time?\nLet\u2019s say that we add just one more time of measurement, so we have two waves in our study. The first advantage is\nthat now we have a way to check the first condition of causality, namely, that causes precede their effects. So we can\ncheck out a time-ordered correlation. Continuing with our example, with time in the design, we can look at whether the\npotential cause at Time 1 predicts the potential outcome at Time 2. This is depicted in the figure below. So we are excited\nto be able to use the word \u201cpredict\u201d correctly to describe our correlation. However, this is still just a zero-order bivariate\ncorrelation, so it does not allow a causal inference\u2014it still has all the problems with those dreaded \u201cthird variables\u201d\nor alternative causal explanations. But we can use our two time points to start looking at how our target outcome is\nchanging from Time 1 to Time 2 and to see whether those changes can be predicted from where each person was on the\npotential cause at Time 1.\nSo what do we like about this kind of design?\nWe get to look at developmental trajectories as our\noutcomes (and if we add more time points, they will look\nmore like trajectories), we are looking directly at\nindividual differences in trajectories, and we are looking\nat predictors of individual differences in those\ntrajectories. So, in our example, we can ask, \u201cDoes teacher\ninvolvement at the beginning of the school year predict\nchanges in students\u2019 engagement from the beginning to\nthe end of the school year?\u201d. And if the empirical answer\nis \u201cyes\u201d (i.e., the antecedent is a significant predictor of\nchange from Time 1 to Time 2), we can say things like\n\u201cStudents whose teachers were warmer and more\nFigure 2.3\ninvolved with them at the beginning of the school year,\nalso showed increases in their engagement over the school year; whereas students whose teachers were less involved\nwith them at the beginning of the school year, showed corresponding declines in their engagement as the year\nprogressed.\u201d This is a descriptive statement, but it is consistent with a causal hypothesis.\nAny other advantages?\nYes. We can also, using the same design, look at the \u201creciprocal\u201d predictions, in that we can take our antecedent\nvariable and examine how it changes from Time 1 to Time 2, and see whether the variable we had been thinking of as\na consequence (which we now consider as a possible antecedent) predicts these changes\u2014see the figure above. In our\nexample, we would be asking \u201cDo students\u2019 initial levels of engagement at the beginning of the year predict changes\nin how much involvement their teachers provide them over the year?\u201d And, if the empirical answer is \u201cyes,\u201d we can\nsay things like \u201cStudents who were more engaged in fall experienced increasing involvement from their teachers as\nthe year progressed, whereas students who were initially higher in disaffection experienced declines in their teachers\u2019\ninvolvement from fall to spring.\u201d One of the most important things about a design with two points of measurement\n(remember, we just added one more point) is that it allows researchers to begin to pull apart the different directions\nof effects. A concurrent correlation contains information about both directions of effects, which cannot logically be\nuntangled, but the two analyses that we just ran can get the job done\u2014the first looks at the feed forward prediction\nof teacher involvement on changes in subsequent student engagement, whereas the second looks at the feedback\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 61 prediction of student engagement on changes in subsequent teacher involvement. So the answers to the questions\nposed by these two sets of analyses could be different\u2014we could get two \u201cyes\u201ds or two \u201cno\u201ds or one of each. And if we\nget two \u201cyes\u201ds, we have the possibility of a feedback loop, which feels like we are getting some hints about potential\ndynamics in the system.\nWhat about all those pesky third variables, those alternative explanations?\nWell, we have good news and bad news about them.\nWhat is the good news?\nThe good news is that we have reduced them some. If you start thinking about the third variables in the concurrent\ncorrelation in our illustration, that is, all the factors that are positively correlated with both teacher involvement\nand student engagement, an enormous number come to mind (e.g., achievement, SES, supportive caregivers, IQ, a\nsense of relatedness, and so on). And here is the kicker, these are only the ones we can imagine, there are also\nunknown confounders. However, when we include in our design and analyses intra-individual change over time, we are\nusing people as their own controls. This means that out of our potential consequence at Time 2, we are taking each\nparticipant\u2019s starting value of the consequence at Time 1, which has in it by definition everything (known and unknown)\nthat led up to the consequence at Time 1 (e.g., achievement, SES, supportive caregivers, IQ, a sense of relatedness, and\nso on) as well as all the unknowns that created or predicted the consequence at Time 1.\nSo, for example, if we think that achievement is a possible alternative causal explanation for the zero-order correlation\nbetween teacher involvement at Time 1 and student engagement at Time 2 (meaning that high performing students are\nmore engaged and teachers pay more attention to them), when we control for student engagement Time 1, we take\nout all of the achievement that was responsible for engagement up to that point, so we have controlled for that as a\npotential confounder. By controlling for the same variable at an earlier point in time, we have scraped off all the known\nand unknown predictors of engagement up until Time 1 that could be a potential confounder, or a plausible pre-existing\ndifference, or an alternative causal chain.\nSo then what is the bad news?\nThe bad news is that the notorious third variables are not completely eliminated. Since we are still looking at a kind\nof correlation\u2014specifically the correlation between teacher involvement at Time 1 and changes in student engagement\nfrom Time 1 to Time 2\u2013 we are still on the hunt for possible alternative causes of both. Remember, before we\nwere looking for things that were correlated with both teacher involvement and student engagement, but now, with\nthis design, we can narrow our candidates for third variables down to those that are correlated with both teacher\ninvolvement and changes in student engagement.\nWhat should we be thinking about in adding time to our study design?\nLet\u2019s start with some basic questions that we almost never know the answers to\u2014What are the right windows and the\nright time gaps between measurement points? We ran into this problem, called \u201ctime and timing\u201d (Lerner, Schwartz, &\nPhelps, 2009), in the chapter on descriptive longitudinal designs, when we had to pick the developmental window (time)\nover which we thought our target change was likely to occur, and then decide on the spacing between measurement\npoints (timing) needed to capture its hypothesized rate and pattern of change. In descriptive designs, we ask these\nquestions about the developmental outcomes, but in explanatory designs, we also ask them about the causal process:\n\u201cDuring what developmental window (time) are our target causal processes likely to be active?\u201d and \u201cWhat spacing\n(timing) should we use to capture the rate at which this causal process is likely to generate its effects (both feedforward\nand feedback)?\u201d. For example, if we are thinking about teacher involvement and student engagement, it seems like the\nbeginning of a new school year would be a good moment for them to be calibrating to each other (time), but how long\n62 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs would that take (timing)\u2014a week, a month, six weeks? Who knows? One rule of thumb is to use more measurement\npoints than you think you will need, so you can look over different time gaps for your possible process.\nWhat do you mean \u201cmore\u201d? Weren\u2019t we excited to be\nadding just one more time of measurement?\nWell, two is qualitatively better than one, so that\u2019s good.\nBut more really is merrier. Additional times of\nmeasurement allow researchers to look at these\npredictors of change across additional time gaps, for\nexample, from a predictor at Time 2 to changes from Time\n2 to Time 3 (as depicted in the figure). Multiple time\npoints also open up a new world\u2014one filled with\ntrajectories of mean level change as the outcomes of our\nFigure 2.4\ncausal processes.\nA first step in this direction has been referred to as a \u201claunch\u201d model because it tries to examine whether an individuals\u2019\ninitial levels on an antecedent can predict the individuals\u2019 trajectory on the target consequence. The term \u201claunch\u201d is\nused because such a model assumes that the initial levels of the potential causal variable may act like a catapult or rocket\nlauncher to create the direction and angle of change in the object that is hurled, that is, the target outcome.\nCan we even use these designs to look at how changes in our antecedents predict changes in our outcomes?\nYes, these have been called \u201cchange-to-change\u201d models), but you can\u2019t really use the word \u201cpredict\u201d to describe these\nconnections. They are actually like correlations between growth curves, and then we land back in our concurrent\ncorrelations puddle\u2014where we still don\u2019t know who is preceding whom. So it would probably be better to look at the\nconnections between time-lagged growth curves, for example, the connections between a growth curve from Time 1\nto Time n to predict an outcome from Time 2 to Time n+1. Then you could also look at reciprocal change-to-change\neffects by switching around your antecedents and consequences. Just like with the designs that incorporate only two\nmeasurement points, these two analyses can provide different estimates of the connections between the different\nportions of the growth curves.\nWhat is happening with all our third variables in these analyses?\nWe can control for them, but it may be more interesting to look directly at their effects, by organizing our data into\na \u201cniche\u201d study, where we look at the connections we are interested in for subgroups of children\u2014for boys or girls\nseparately or for students high or low in achievement. If the connection between teacher involvement and student\nengagement is due to gender, it will disappear when we look at boys and girls separately. As you know, looking directly\nat the developmental patterns of different groups is more consistent with a lifespan developmental systems perspective,\nwhich holds that development is differentially shaped by the characteristics of the people and their contexts.\nDescriptive and Explanatory Designs | 63 Transition to Middle School: Stage-Environment Fit\nWhat is responsible for the dramatic losses observed in students\u2019 motivation, engagement, academic performance, and self-\nconfidence across the transition to middle school?\nResearchers were interested in the factors that could explain these regular and significant declines in functioning. One group of\nresearchers begin by examining the characteristics of schools that shifted from the organization of elementary schools to middle\nschools, things like larger student bodies, harsher discipline, and school days chopped up into shorter subject-specific periods\ntaught by different teachers. Because school transitions take place across specific age ranges, a competing explanation was\nneurophysiological development\u2014the idea that declines were the result of the tolls of puberty and adolescence, which would have\ntaken place with or without a school transition.\nClever researchers used study designs that allowed them to separate the age changes of adolescence from the environmental\ntransition across middle school. Researchers compared students from school districts that were organized in three different ways:\n(1) K-8 schools in which buildings included kindergarten through eighth grade; (2) elementary and middle schools in which\ndistricts reshuffled students from all elementary schools (K-5) into larger middle schools (6-8); and (3) elementary and junior high\nschools in which districts reshuffled students from all elementary schools (K-6) into larger junior high schools (7-8).\nThe results of these kinds of studies were definitive (Eccles & Midgley, 1989). Adolescence was not the primary risk factor for\ndeclines in functioning\u2014precipitous drops were apparent at whatever age the school transition took place (6th grade for districts\nwith middle schools or 7th grade for those with junior high schools) and, most important, such drops were not seen (or were\ngreatly reduced) across the same ages in districts that did not require school transitions (K-8 schools).\nThe best account of these issues seems to be provided by stage-environment fit (Eccles et al., 1993) in which the changes students\ntypically experience over the transition to middle or junior high school include features (e.g., more distant and less caring\nteacher-student relationships, more competitive and performance-oriented learning goals, more impersonal discipline, and fewer\nchoices about academic work) that turn out to be a very bad match for the changing needs of adolescents (for stronger adult\nrelationships outside the family, more intrinsic motivation, and greater autonomy in learning).\nThese design ideas for naturalistic studies seem much less systematic than the strategies we learned about for\nexperimental studies.\nYes, it can sometimes feel like the wild west out here on the frontier where we are trying to extract valid causal\ninferences from naturalistic studies. But keep in mind that you are not alone. Researchers from many other disciplines,\nlike epidemiology, sociology, and economics (e.g., Gangl, 2010; Heckman, 2008), are also developing useful methods for\ntracking down causal processes, because they can no more create controlled experiments\u2013 in which they crash stock\nmarkets or start epidemics or shift social mores\u2014than can developmental scientists. As part of this search, they are\nuncovering an important set of tools for causal inferences in the careful application of sound statistical methods (e.g.,\nMadigan et al., 2014; see box).\nTake Home Messages for Naturalistic Field Studies\nWe would highlight four.\n1. The first is a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d to the question of whether naturalistic field studies can contribute to rich causal\naccounts of development. These are studies that contain everything you want to know about your target\nphenomenon, so it is worthwhile to figure out how to decipher that information in ways that yield valid causal\naccounts.\n2. The second take home is a resounding \u201cWhoa!\u201d because the ways that causes likely operate in the complex dynamic\nsystem of which our target phenomenon is a part can be truly mind-bending. So we need to pause and get our\nmeta-theoretical glasses firmly on our noses before we start sifting through designs and strategies.\n3. Third, our most trusty tool is time itself\u2014the times of measurement in longitudinal and time series designs, the\ntime windows over which we choose to hover, and the timing (spacing) of our measurements so they map onto the\npace of our causal processes.\n64 | Descriptive and Explanatory Designs 4. Our final take-home is that the search for design ideas for wresting causal information out of naturalistic field\nstudies will take you into some beautiful and uncharted territory. When you encounter a complex problem (like\nhistorical embeddedness or cohort effects), your immediate reaction may \u201cHow do I avoid this problem?\u201d or \u201cHow\ndo I solve this problem?\u201d But instead of resorting to coping, we would encourage you to react with curiosity. In\nother words, the best advice that lifespan developmental researchers can give themselves is always \u201cDon\u2019t ignore.\nDon\u2019t evade. Turn around and look.\u201d These are not methodological problems you have encountered. They are\nmessages from your target developmental phenomena. And, if you have ears to hear, you can learn a great deal by\nwalking directly towards them.\nTake Home Messages for the Goals of Developmental Science and Descriptive and Explanatory Designs\nTake home messages are also contained in the summary tables for the three goals of developmental science, and the\ntables describing (1) cross-sectional, longitudinal, and sequential designs, and for (2) experimental and correlational\ndesigns in the laboratory and the field. For the designs, we would like you to be able to define each one, identify the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss when it would make sense to use each of them in a program of\nresearch. Be sure to revisit the concept of converging operations\u2014 it helps pull together the idea that the strengths of\neach design can help compensate for the weaknesses of other designs!\nAdapted from: Skinner, E.

This bidirectional\ninterplay indicates that the environment can affect the expression of genes just as genetic predispositions can impact a\nperson\u2019s potentials. Additionally, environmental circumstances can trigger symptoms of a genetic disorder. For example,\na person who has sickle cell anemia, a recessive gene linked disorder, can experience a sickle cell crisis under conditions\nof oxygen deprivation. Or, someone predisposed genetically to type-two diabetes can trigger the disease through poor\ndiet and little exercise.\nResearch has shown how the environment and genotype interact in several ways. Genotype-Environment Correlations\nrefer to the processes by which genetic factors contribute to variations in the environment (Plomin, DeFries, Knopik, &\nNiederhiser, 2013). There are three types of genotype-environment correlations:\nPassive genotype-environment correlations occur when\nchildren passively inherit both the genes and the environments\ntheir family provides. Certain behavioral characteristics, such as\nbeing athletically inclined, may run in families. Children in these\nfamilies have inherited both the genes that would enable\nsuccess at these activities, and an environment that encourages\nthem to engage in sports. Figure 3.1 highlights this correlation\nby demonstrating how a family passes on water skiing skills\nthrough both genetics and environmental opportunities.\nEvocative genotype-environment correlations refer to how the\nsocial environment reacts to individuals based on their inherited\nFigure 3.1\ncharacteristics. For example, whether children have a more\noutgoing or shy temperament will affect how they are treated\nby others.\nActive genotype-environment correlations occur when individuals seek out environments that support their genetic\ntendencies. This is also referred to as niche picking. For example, children who are musically inclined seek out music\ninstruction and opportunities that then facilitate their natural musical ability.\nConversely, genotype-environment interactions involve genetic susceptibility to the environment. Adoption studies\nprovide evidence for genotype-environment interactions. For example, the Early Growth and Development Study (Leve,\nNeiderhiser, Scaramella, & Reiss, 2010) followed 360 adopted children and their adopted and biological parents in a\nlongitudinal study. Results have shown that children whose biological parents exhibited psychopathology, exhibited\nsignificantly fewer behavior problems when their adoptive parents used more structured (vs. unstructured) parenting.\nAdditionally, higher levels of psychopathology in adoptive parents increased the risk that children would develop\nbehavior problems, but only when the biological parents\u2019 psychopathology was also high. Consequently, these results\nshow that environmental effects on behavior differ based on the individual\u2019s genotype, especially the effects of stressful\nenvironments on genetically at-risk children.\nLastly, the study of epigenetics examines modifications in DNA that affect gene expression and are passed on when\nthe cells divide. Environmental factors, such as nutrition, stress, and teratogens are thought to change gene expression\n68 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development by switching genes on and off. These gene changes can then be inherited by daughter cells. This would explain why\nmonozygotic or identical twins may increasingly differ in gene expression with age. For example, Fraga et al. (2005)\nfound that when examining differences in DNA, a group of monozygotic twins were indistinguishable during the early\nyears. However, when the twins were older there were significant discrepancies in their gene expression, most likely\ndue to different experiences. These differences included a range of personal characteristics, including susceptibilities\nto disease.\nBox 3.1 The Human Genome Project\nIn 1990 the Human Genome Project (HGP), an international scientific endeavor, began the task of\nsequencing the 3 billion base pairs that make up the human genome. In April of 2003, more than two years\nahead of schedule, scientists gave us the genetic blueprint for building a human. Since then, using this\ninformation from the HGP, researchers have discovered the genes involved in over 1800 diseases. In 2005\nthe HGP amassed a large data base called HapMap that catalogs genetic variations in 11 global populations.\nData on genetic variation can improve our understanding of differential risk for disease and reactions to\nmedical treatments, such as drugs. Pharmacogenomic researchers have already developed tests to\ndetermine whether a patient will respond favorably to certain drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer,\nlung cancer, or HIV by using information from HapMap (NIH, 2015).\nFuture directions for the HGP include identifying the genetic markers for all 50 major forms of cancer (The\nCancer Genome Atlas), continuing to create more effective drugs for the treatment of disease, and\nexamining the legal, social and ethical implications of genetic knowledge (NIH, 2015).\nFrom the outset, the HGP established ethical issues one of their main concerns. Part of the HGP\u2019s budget\nsupports research and holds workshops that address these concerns. Who owns this information, and how\nthe availability of genetic information may influence healthcare and its impact on individuals, their families,\nand the greater community are just some of the many questions being addressed (NIH, 2015).\nLearning Objectives: Prenatal Development\n\u2022 Describe the changes that occur in the three periods of prenatal development\n\u2022 Describe what occurs during prenatal brain development\n\u2022 Define teratogens and describe the factors that influence their effects\n\u2022 List and describe the effects of several common teratogens\n\u2022 Explain maternal and paternal factors that affect the developing fetus\n\u2022 Explain the types of prenatal assessment\n\u2022 Describe both the minor and major complications of pregnancy\n\u2022 Describe two common procedures to assess the condition of the newborn\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 69 \u2022 Describe problems newborns experience before, during, and after birth\nPrenatal Development\nNow we turn our attention to prenatal development which is divided into three periods: (1) the germinal period, (2) the\nembryonic period, and (3) the fetal period. The following is an overview of some of the changes that take place during\neach period.\nThe Germinal Period\nThe germinal period (about 14 days in length) lasts from\nconception to implantation of the fertilized egg in the lining of\nthe uterus (see Figure 3.2). At ejaculation millions of sperm are\nreleased into the vagina, but only a few reach the egg and\ntypically only one fertilizes the egg. Once a single sperm has\nentered the wall of the egg, the wall becomes hard and prevents\nother sperm from entering. After the sperm has entered the\negg, the tail of the sperm breaks off and the head of the sperm,\ncontaining the genetic information from the father, unites with\nthe nucleus of the egg. The egg is typically fertilized in the top\nsection of the fallopian tube and continues its journey to the\nFigure 3.2. Sperm and ovum at conception\nuterus. As a result, a new cell is formed. This cell, containing the\ncombined genetic information from both parents, is referred to\nas a zygote.\nDuring this time, the organism begins cell division through mitosis. After five days of mitosis there is a group of 100\ncells, which is now called a blastocyst. The blastocyst consists of both an inner and outer group of cells. The inner group of\ncells, or embryonic disk will become the embryo, while the outer group of cells, or trophoblast, becomes the support system\nwhich nourishes the developing organism. This stage ends when the blastocyst fully implants into the uterine wall (U.S.\nNational Library of Medicine, 2015a). Approximately 50-75% of blastocysts do not implant in the uterine wall (Betts et al.,\n2019).\nMitosis is a fragile process and fewer than half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks (Hall, 2004). Some of the\nreasons for this include the egg and sperm do not join properly, meaning that their genetic material does not combine;\nthere is too little or damaged genetic material; the zygote does not replicate; or the blastocyst does not implant into\nthe uterine wall. The failure rate is higher for in vitro conceptions. Figure 3.3 illustrates the journey of the ova from its\nrelease to its fertilization, cell duplication, and implantation into the uterine lining.\n70 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development Figure 3.3. Germinal Period\nThe Embryonic Period\nStarting the third week the blastocyst has implanted in the\nuterine wall. Upon implantation this multi-cellular organism is\ncalled an embryo. Now blood vessels grow, forming the\nplacenta. The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that\nprovides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the\ndeveloping embryo via the umbilical cord. During this period,\ncells continue to differentiate. Growth during prenatal\ndevelopment occurs in two major directions: from head to tail\ncalled cephalocaudal development and from the midline\noutward referred to as proximodistal development. This means\nthat those structures nearest the head develop before those\nFigure 3.4. The embryo\nnearest the feet and those structures nearest the torso develop\nbefore those away from the center of the body (such as hands and fingers). The head develops in the fourth week and\nthe precursor to the heart begins to pulse. In the early stages of the embryonic period, gills and a tail are apparent.\nHowever, by the end of this stage they disappear and the organism takes on a more human appearance. Some organisms\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 71 fail during the embryonic period, usually due to gross chromosomal abnormalities. As in the case of the germinal period,\noften the gestational parent does not yet know that they are pregnant.\nIt is during this stage that the major structures of the body are taking form making the embryonic period the time when\nthe organism is most vulnerable to the greatest amount of damage if exposed to harmful substances. Potential mothers\nare not often aware of the risks they introduce to the developing embryo during this time. The embryo is approximately 1\ninch in length and weighs about 8 grams at the end of eight weeks (Betts et al., 2019). The embryo can move and respond\nto touch at this time.\nThe Fetal Period\nFrom the ninth week until birth, the organism is referred to as a fetus. During this stage, the major structures are\ncontinuing to develop. By the third month, the fetus has all its body parts including external genitalia. In the following\nweeks, the fetus will develop hair, nails, teeth and the excretory and digestive systems will continue to develop. The\nfetus is about 3 inches long and weighs about 28 grams.\nDuring the 4th \u2013 6th months, the eyes become more sensitive to light and hearing develops. The respiratory system\ncontinues to develop, and reflexes such as sucking, swallowing and hiccupping, develop during the 5th month. Cycles\nof sleep and wakefulness are present at this time as well. The first chance of survival outside the womb, known as the\nage of viability is reached at about 24 weeks (Morgan, Goldenberg, & Schulkin, 2008). The majority of the neurons in the\nbrain have developed by 24 weeks, although they are still rudimentary, and the glial or nurse cells that support neurons\ncontinue to grow. At 24 weeks the fetus can feel pain (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1997).\nBetween the 7th \u2013 9th months, the fetus is primarily preparing for birth. It is exercising its muscles and its lungs begin\nto expand and contract. The fetus gains about 5 pounds and 7 inches during this last trimester of pregnancy, and during\nthe 8th month a layer of fat develops under the skin. This layer of fat serves as insulation and helps the baby regulate\nbody temperature after birth.\nAt around 36 weeks the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches long. By week\n37 all of the fetus\u2019s organ systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the mother\u2019s uterus without many\nof the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately\n40 weeks. By then the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent. The progression through\nthe stages is shown in Figure 3.5.\n72 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development Figure 3.5. Prenatal development age milestones\nPrenatal Brain Development\nPrenatal brain development begins in the third gestational week with the differentiation of stem cells, which are capable\nof producing all the different cells that make up the brain (Stiles & Jernigan, 2010). The location of these stem cells in the\nembryo is referred to as the neural plate. By the end of the third week, two ridges appear along the neural plate first\nforming the neural groove and then the neural tube. The open region in the center of the neural tube forms the brain\u2019s\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 73 ventricles and spinal canal. By the end of the embryonic period, or week eight, the neural tube has further differentiated\ninto the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.\nBrain development during the fetal period involves neuron production, migration, and differentiation. From the early\nfetal period until midgestation, most of the 85 billion neurons have been generated and many have already migrated to\ntheir brain positions. Neurogenesis, or the formation of neurons, is largely completed after five months of gestation. One\nexception is in the hippocampus, which continues to develop neurons throughout life. Neurons that form the neocortex,\nor the layer of cells that lie on the surface of the brain, migrate to their location in an orderly way. Neural migration is\nmostly completed in the cerebral cortex by 24 weeks (Poduri & Volpe, 2018).\nOnce in position, neurons begin to produce dendrites and axons that begin to form the neural networks responsible for\ninformation processing. Regions of the brain that contain the cell bodies are referred to as the gray matter because they\nlook gray in appearance. The axons that form the neural pathways make up the white matter because they are covered\nin myelin, a fatty substance that is white in appearance. Myelin aids in both the insulation and efficiency of neural\ntransmission. Although cell differentiation is complete at birth, the growth of dendrites, axons, and synapses continue\nfor years.\nTeratogens\nGood prenatal care is essential for healthy development. The developing child is most at risk for severe problems during\nthe first three months of development. Unfortunately, this is a time when many gestational parents are unaware that\nthey are pregnant. Today, we know many of the factors that can jeopardize the health of the developing child. The study\nof factors that contribute to birth defects is called teratology. Teratogens are environmental factors that can contribute to\nbirth defects, and include some parental diseases, pollutants, drugs and alcohol.\nFactors influencing prenatal risks. There are several considerations in determining the kind and amount of damage\nthat can result from exposure to a particular teratogen (Berger, 2005). These include:\n\u2022 The timing of the exposure. Structures in the body are vulnerable to the most severe damage when they are\nforming. If a substance is introduced during a particular structure\u2019s critical period (time of development), the\ndamage to that structure may be greater. For example, the ears and arms reach their critical periods at about 6\nweeks after conception. If a mother exposes the embryo to certain substances during this period, its ears and arms\nmay be malformed.\n\u2022 The amount of exposure. Some substances are not harmful unless the amounts reach a certain level. The critical\nlevel depends in part on the size and metabolism of the mother.\n\u2022 The number of teratogens. Fetuses exposed to multiple teratogens typically have more problems than those\nexposed to only one.\n\u2022 Genetics. Genetic make-up also plays a role in the impact a particular teratogen has on a child. This is suggested\nby research showing that fraternal twins exposed to the same prenatal environment, do not always experience the\nsame teratogenic effects. The genetic make-up of the mother can also have an effect; some gestational parents\nmay be more resistant to teratogenic effects than others.\n\u2022 Being male or female. Males are more likely to experience damage due to teratogens than are females. It is\nbelieved that the Y chromosome, which contains fewer genes than the X, may make males more vulnerable.\nFigure 3.6 illustrates the timing of teratogen exposure and the types of structural defects that can occur during the\nprenatal period.\n74 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development Figure 3.6. Critical periods of prenatal development\nAlcohol. One of the most common teratogens is alcohol, and because half of all pregnancies in the United States are\nunplanned, it is recommended that people of child-bearing age take great caution against drinking alcohol when not\nusing birth control or when pregnant (CDC, 2005). Alcohol use during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause\nof intellectual disabilities in children in the United States (Maier & West, 2001). Alcohol consumption at any point\nduring pregnancy, but particularly during the second month of prenatal development, may lead to neurocognitive and\nbehavioral difficulties that can last a lifetime.\nIn extreme cases, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal death, but also can result in Fetal Alcohol\nSpectrum Disorders (FASD), which is an umbrella term for the range of effects that can occur due to alcohol consumption\nduring pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2016a). The most severe form of FASD is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children\nwith FAS share certain physical features such as flattened noses, small eye holes, and small heads (see Figure 3.7).\nCognitively, these children have poor judgment, poor impulse control, higher rates of ADHD, learning issues, and lower\nIQ scores. These developmental problems and delays persist into adulthood (Streissguth, Barr, Kogan, & Bookstein, 1996)\nand contribute to criminal behavior, psychiatric problems, and unemployment (CDC, 2016a). Based on animal studies, it\nhas been hypothesized that a gestational parent\u2019s alcohol consumption during pregnancy may predispose their child to\nlike alcohol (Youngentob, Molina, Spear, & Youngentob, 2007). Binge drinking, or 4 or more drinks in 2 to 3 hours, during\npregnancy increases the chance of having a baby with FASD (March of Dimes, 2016a).\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 75 Figure 3.7\nTobacco. Another widely used teratogen is tobacco; in fact, in 2016, more than 7% of pregnant women smoked in 2016\n(Someji & Beltr\u00e1n-S\u00e1nchez, 2019). According to Tong et al. (2013) in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, data from 27 sites in 2010 representing 52% of live births, showed that among women with recent live\nbirths:\n\u2022 About 23% reported smoking in the 3 months prior to pregnancy.\n\u2022 Almost 11% reported smoking during pregnancy.\n\u2022 More than half (54.3%) reported that they quit smoking by the last 3 months of pregnancy.\n\u2022 Almost 16% reported smoking after delivery.\nWhen comparing the ages of women who smoked:\n\u2022 Women <20, 13.6% smoked during pregnancy\n\u2022 Women 20\u201324 ,17.6% smoked during pregnancy\n\u2022 Women 25\u201334 , 8.8% smoked during pregnancy\n\u2022 Women \u226535, 5.7% smoked during pregnancy\nThe findings among racial and ethnic groups indicated that smoking during pregnancy was highest among American\nIndians/Alaska Natives (26.0%) and lowest among Asians/Pacific Islanders (2.1%).\nWhen a pregnant person smokes, the fetus is exposed to dangerous chemicals including nicotine, carbon monoxide, and\ntar, which lessen the amount of oxygen available to the fetus. Oxygen is important for overall growth and development.\nTobacco use during pregnancy has been associated with ecotopic pregnancy (fertilized egg implants itself outside of the\nuterus), placenta previa (placenta lies low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix), placenta abruption (placenta\nseparates prematurely from the uterine wall), preterm delivery, low birth weight, stillbirth, fetal growth restriction,\nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), birth defects, learning disabilities, and early puberty in girls (Center for Disease\nControl, 2015d).\n76 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development When gestational parents are exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy, this also increases the risk of low-birth\nweight infants. In addition, exposure to thirdhand smoke, or toxins from tobacco smoke that linger on clothing, furniture,\nand in locations where smoking has occurred, can have a negative impact on infants\u2019 lung development. Rehan, Sakurai,\nand Torday (2011) found that prenatal exposure to thirdhand smoke played a greater role in altered lung functioning than\npostnatal exposure.\nPrescription/Over-the-counter Drugs: About 70% of pregnant people take at least one prescription drug (March of\nDimes, 2016e). A person should not be taking any prescription medication during pregnancy unless it was prescribed by\na health care provider who knows that person is pregnant. Some prescription drugs can cause birth defects, problems\nin overall health, and development of the fetus. Over-the-counter drugs are also a concern during the prenatal period\nbecause they may cause certain health problems. For example, the pain reliever ibuprofen can cause serious blood flow\nproblems to the fetus during the last three months.\nIllicit Drugs: Common illicit drugs include marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and other club drugs, heroin, and prescription\ndrugs that are abused. It is difficult to fully determine the effects of particular illicit drugs on a developing fetus because\nmost mothers who use, use more than one substance and have other unhealthy behaviors. These include smoking,\ndrinking alcohol, not eating healthy meals, and being more likely to get a sexually transmitted disease.\nHowever, several problems seem clear. The use of cocaine is connected with low birth weight, stillbirths, and\nspontaneous abortion. Heavy marijuana use is associated with problems in brain development (March of Dimes, 2016c). If\na baby\u2019s gestational parent used an addictive drug during pregnancy that baby can get addicted to the drug before birth and\ngo through drug withdrawal after birth, also known as Neonatal abstinence syndrome (March of Dimes, 2015d). Other\ncomplications of illicit drug use include premature birth, smaller than normal head size, birth defects, heart defects,\nand infections. Additionally, babies born to gestational parents who use drugs may have problems later in life, including\ndeath from sudden infant death syndrome, slower than normal growth, and learning and behavior difficulties. Children\nof substance abusing parents are also considered at high risk for a range of biological, developmental, academic, and\nbehavioral problems, including developing substance abuse problems of their own (Conners, et al., 2003).\nBox 3.2 Should People Who Use Drugs During Pregnancy Be Arrested and Jailed?\nPeople who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can cause serious lifelong harm to their children. Some\npeople have advocated mandatory screenings for people who become pregnant and have a history of drug\nabuse, and if the people continue using, to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate them (Figdor & Kaeser, 1998).\nThis policy was tried in Charleston, South Carolina 20 years ago. The policy was called the Interagency\nPolicy on Management of Substance Abuse During Pregnancy and had disastrous results.\nThe Interagency Policy applied to patients attending the obstetrics clinic at MUSC, which primarily serves\npatients who are indigent or on Medicaid. It did not apply to private obstetrical patients. The policy required\npatient education about the harmful effects of substance abuse during pregnancy. A statement also warned\npatients that protection of unborn and newborn children from the harms of illegal drug abuse could involve\nthe Charleston police, the Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Court, and the Protective Services Division of the\nDepartment of Social Services (DSS). (Jos, Marshall, & Perlmutter, 1995, pp. 120\u2013121).\nRather than helping newborns, this policy seemed to deter gestational parents from seeking prenatal care\nand to deter them from seeking other social services. And because this policy was applied solely to low-\nincome people, it also resulted in lawsuits. The program was canceled after 5 years, during which time 42\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 77 gestational parents were arrested. A federal agency later determined that the program involved human\nexperimentation without the approval and oversight of an institutional review board (IRB).\nIn July 2014, Tennessee enacted a law that allows people who illegally use a narcotic drug while pregnant to\nbe prosecuted for assault if her infant is harmed or addicted to the drug (National Public Radio, 2015).\nAccording to the National Public Radio report, a baby is born dependent on a drug every 30 minutes in\nTennessee, which is a rate three times higher than the national average. However, since the law took effect\nthe number of babies born having drug withdrawal symptoms has not diminished. Critics contend that the\ncriminal justice system should not be involved in what is considered a healthcare problem. What do you\nthink? Do you consider the issue of gestational parents using illicit drugs more of a legal or a medical\nconcern?\nPollutants. There are more than 83,000 chemicals used in the United States with little information on their effects on\nunborn children (March of Dimes, 2016b).\n\u2022 Lead poisoning. An environmental pollutant of significant concern is lead, which has been linked to fertility\nproblems, high blood pressure, low birth weight, prematurity, miscarriage, and delayed neurological development.\nGrossman and Slutsky (2017) found that babies born in Flint Michigan, an area identified with high lead levels in the\ndrinking water, were premature, weighed less than average, and gained less weight than normal.\n\u2022 Pesticides. Chemicals in certain pesticides are also potentially damaging and may lead to miscarriage, low birth\nweight, premature birth, birth defects, and learning problems, (March of Dimes, 2014).\n\u2022 Bisphenol A. Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical commonly used in plastics and food and beverage\ncontainers, may disrupt the action of certain genes contributing to particular birth defects (March of Dimes,\n2016b).\n\u2022 Radiation. If a gestational parent is exposed to radiation, it can get into the bloodstream and pass through the\numbilical cord to the fetus. Radiation can also build up in body areas close to the uterus, such as the bladder.\nExposure to radiation can cause result in miscarriage, affect brain development, slow the baby\u2019s growth, or cause\nbirth defects or cancer.\n\u2022 Mercury. Mecury, a heavy metal, can cause brain damage and affect the baby\u2019s hearing and vision. This is why\npeople are cautioned about the amount and type of fish they consume during pregnancy.\nToxoplasmosis. The tiny parasite, toxoplasma gondii, causes an\ninfection called toxoplasmosis. According to the March of\nDimes (2012d), toxoplasma gondii infects more than 60 million\npeople in the United States. A healthy immune system can keep\nthe parasite at bay resulting in no symptoms, so most people do\nnot know they are infected. As a routine prenatal screening\nfrequently does not test for the presence of this parasite,\npregnant people may want to talk to their health-care provider\nabout being tested. Toxoplasmosis can cause premature birth,\nstillbirth, and can result in birth defects to the eyes and brain.\nWhile most babies born with this infection show no symptoms,\nten percent may experience eye infections, enlarged liver and Figure 3.8\nspleen, jaundice, and pneumonia. To avoid being infected,\n78 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development gestational parents should avoid eating undercooked or raw meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables, touching cooking\nutensils that touched raw meat or unwashed fruits and vegetables, and touching cat feces, soil, or sand. If people think\nthey may have been infected during pregnancy, they should have their newborn tested.\nSexually transmitted diseases. Gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections that can be\npassed to the fetus by an infected gestational parent. Gestational parents should be tested as early as possible to\nminimize the risk of spreading these infections to their unborn children. Additionally, the earlier the treatment begins,\nthe better the health outcomes for parent and baby (CDC, 2016d). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can cause an\nectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, premature rupture of the amniotic sac, premature birth, still births. and birth defects\n(March of Dimes, 2013). Although some STDs can cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus, most babies become\ninfected with STDS while passing through the birth canal during delivery.\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). One of the most potentially devastating teratogens is HIV. HIV and Acquired\nImmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are leading causes of illness and death in the United States (Health Resources and\nServices Administration, 2015). One of the main ways children under age 13 become infected with HIV is via mother-\nto-child transmission of the virus prenatally, during labor, or by breastfeeding (CDC, 2016c). There are measures that\ncan be taken to lower the chance the child will contract the disease. HIV positive gestational parents who take antiviral\nmedications during their pregnancy greatly reduce the chance of passing the virus to the fetus. The risk of transmission\nis less than 2%; in contrast, if the gestational parent does not take antiretroviral drugs, the risk is elevated to 25% (CDC,\n2016b). However, the long-term risks of prenatal exposure to the medication are not known. It is recommended that\npeople with HIV deliver the child by c-section, and that after birth they avoid breast feeding.\nGerman measles (or rubella). Rubella, also called German measles, is an infection that causes mild flu-like symptoms\nand a rash on the skin. Rubella in the gestational parent has been associated with a number of birth defects. If the\ngestational parent contracts the disease during the first three months of pregnancy, damage can occur in the eyes,\nears, heart or brain of the unborn child. if the pregnant person has German measles before the 11th week of prenatal\ndevelopment, deafness is almost certain and brain damage can also result. People in the United States are much less\nlikely to be afflicted with rubella, because most receive childhood vaccinations which protect them from the disease.\nMaternal Factors\nGestational parent over 35. Most people over 35 who become pregnant are in good health and have healthy\npregnancies. However, according to the March of Dimes (2016d), people over age 35 have an increased risk of:\n\u2022 Fertility problems\n\u2022 High blood pressure\n\u2022 Diabetes\n\u2022 Miscarriages\n\u2022 Placenta Previa\n\u2022 Cesarean section\n\u2022 Premature birth\n\u2022 Stillbirth\n\u2022 A baby with a genetic disorder or other birth defects\nBecause a gestational parent is born with all their eggs, environmental teratogens can affect the quality of the eggs as\nthey get older. Also, their reproductive system ages which can adversely affect the pregnancy. Some people over 35\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 79 choose special prenatal screening tests, such as a maternal blood screening, to determine if there are any health risks\nfor the baby.\nAlthough there are medical concerns associated with having a\nchild later in life, there are also many positive consequences to\nbeing a more mature parent. Older parents are more confident,\nless stressed, and typically married, which can provide family\nstability. Their children perform better on math and reading\ntests, and they are less prone to injuries or emotional troubles\n(Albert, 2013). People who choose to wait are often well\neducated and lead healthy lives. According to Gregory (2007),\nolder women are more stable, demonstrate a stronger family\nfocus, possess greater self-confidence, and have more money.\nHaving a child later in one\u2019s career equals overall higher wages.\nFigure 3.9.\nIn fact, for every year a gestational parent delays becoming a\nparent, they make 9% more in lifetime earnings. Lastly, gestational parents who delay having children actually live\nlonger. Sun et al. (2015) found that women who had their last child after the age of 33 doubled their chances of living to\nage 95 or older than women who had their last child before their 30th birthday. A gestational parent\u2019s natural ability to\nhave a child at a later age indicates that their reproductive system is aging slowly, and consequently so is the rest of\ntheir body.\nTeenage pregnancy. A teenage gestational parent is at a greater risk for complications during pregnancy, including\nanemia and high blood pressure. These risks are even greater for those under age 15. Infants born to teenage gestational\nparents have a higher risk of being born prematurely and having low birthweight or other serious health problems.\nPremature and low birthweight babies may have organs that are not fully developed which can result in breathing\nproblems, bleeding in the brain, vision loss, and serious intestinal problems. Very low birthweight babies (less than 3 1/3\npounds) are more than 100 times as likely to die, and moderately low birthweight babies (between 3 1/3 and 5 \u00bd pounds)\nare more than 5 times as likely to die in their first year, than normal weight babies (March of Dimes, 2012c). Again, the risk\nis highest for babies of gestational parents under age 15. A primary reason for these health issues is that teenagers are\nthe least likely of all age groups to get early and regular prenatal care. Additionally, they may engage in risky behaviors\nduring pregnancy, including eating unhealthy food, smoking, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs. Additional concerns for\nteenagers are repeat births. About 25% of teen gestational parents under age 18 have a second baby within 2 years after\nthe first baby\u2019s birth.\nGestational diabetes. Seven percent of pregnant people develop gestational diabetes (March of Dimes, 2015b). Diabetes\nis a condition where the body has too much glucose in the bloodstream. Most pregnant people have their glucose level\ntested at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the gestational parent gives birth,\nbut it might indicate a risk for developing diabetes later in life. If untreated, gestational diabetes can cause premature\nbirth, stillbirth, infant breathing problems at birth, jaundice, or low blood sugar. Babies born to mothers with gestational\ndiabetes can also be considerably heavier (more than 9 pounds) making the labor and birth process more difficult. For\nexpectant mothers, untreated gestational diabetes can cause preeclampsia (high blood pressure and signs that the liver\nand kidneys may not be working properly) discussed later in the chapter. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include\nage (being over age 25), being overweight or gaining too much weight during pregnancy, a family history of diabetes,\nhaving had gestational diabetes with a prior pregnancy, and race and ethnicity (mothers who are African-American,\nNative American, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander have a higher risk). Eating healthy food and maintaining a healthy\nweight during pregnancy can reduce the chance of gestational diabetes. People who already have diabetes and become\npregnant need to attend all their prenatal care visits, and follow the same advice as those for people with gestational\ndiabetes as the risk of preeclampsia, premature birth, birth defects, and stillbirth are the same.\n80 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development High blood pressure (Hypertension). Hypertension is a condition in which the pressure against the wall of the arteries\nbecomes too high. There are two types of high blood pressure during pregnancy, gestational and chronic. Gestational\nhypertension only occurs during pregnancy and goes away after birth. Chronic high blood pressure refers to people\nwho already had hypertension before the pregnancy or to those who developed it during pregnancy and it continued\nafter birth. According to the March of Dimes (2015c) about 8 in every 100 pregnant people have high blood pressure.\nHigh blood pressure during pregnancy can cause premature birth and low birth weight (under five and a half pounds),\nplacental abruption, and mothers can develop preeclampsia.\nRh disease. Rh is a protein found in the blood. Most people are Rh positive, meaning they have this protein. Some people\nare Rh negative, meaning this protein is absent. Gestational parents who are Rh negative are at risk of having a baby with\na form of anemia called Rh disease (March of Dimes, 2009). A father who is Rh-positive and gestational parent who is Rh-\nnegative can conceive a baby who is Rh-positive. Some of the fetus\u2019s blood cells may get into the mother\u2019s bloodstream\nand her immune system is unable to recognize the Rh factor. The immune system starts to produce antibodies to fight\noff what it thinks is a foreign invader. Once the pregnant person\u2019s body produces immunity, the antibodies can cross the\nplacenta and start to destroy the red blood cells of the developing fetus. As this process takes time, often the first Rh\npositive baby is not harmed, but because the pregnant person\u2019s body continues to produce antibodies to the Rh factor\nacross their lifetime, subsequent pregnancies can pose greater risk for an Rh positive baby. In newborns, Rh disease can\nlead to jaundice, anemia, heart failure, brain damage and death.\nWeight gain during pregnancy. According to March of Dimes (2016f) during pregnancy most people need only an\nadditional 300 calories per day to aid in the growth of the fetus. Gaining too little or too much weight during pregnancy\ncan be harmful. People who gain too little may have a baby who is low-birth weight, while those who gain too much are\nlikely to have a premature or large baby. There is also a greater risk for the gestational parent developing preeclampsia\nand diabetes, which can cause further problems during the pregnancy. Table 3.1 shows the healthy weight gain during\npregnancy. Putting on the weight slowly is best. Gestational parents who are concerned about their weight gain should\ntalk to their health care provider.\nTable 3.1 Weight gain during pregnancy\nIf you were a healthy weight If you were underweight If you were overweight before If you were obese before\nbefore pregnancy before pregnancy pregnancy pregnancy\n\u2022 gain 25-35lbs \u2022 gain 28-40lbs\n\u2022 gain 12-25 lbs \u2022 11-20lbs\n\u2022 1-4\u00bdlbs in the first \u2022 1-4\u00bdlbs in the first\n\u2022 1-4\u00bdlbs in the first trimester and a \u2022 1-4\u00bdlbs in the first trimester\ntrimester and 1lb per week trimester and a little more\nlittle more than \u00bdlb per week in the and less than \u00bdlb per week in\nin the second and third than 1lb per week\nsecond and third trimesters the second and third trimesters\ntrimesters thereafter\nMothers of twins need to\ngain more in each category\nStress. It is common to feel stressed during pregnancy, but high levels of stress can cause complications including\nhaving a premature or low-birthweight baby. Babies born early or too small are at an increased risk for health problems.\nStress-related hormones may cause these complications by affecting a gestational parent\u2019s immune systems resulting\nin an infection and premature birth. Additionally, some people deal with stress by smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking\ndrugs, which can lead to problems in the pregnancy. High levels of stress in pregnancy have also been correlated with\nproblems in the baby\u2019s brain development and immune system functioning, as well as childhood problems such as\ntrouble paying attention and anxiety (March of Dimes, 2012b).\nDepression. Depression is a significant medical condition in which feelings of sadness, worthlessness, guilt, and fatigue\ninterfere with one\u2019s daily functioning. Depression can occur before, during, or after pregnancy, and 1 in 7 pregnant\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 81 people are treated for depression sometime between the year before pregnancy and the year after pregnancy (March of\nDimes, 2015a). Women who have experienced depression previously are more likely to have depression while pregnant.\nConsequences of depression include the baby being born prematurely, having a low birthweight, being more irritable,\nless active, less attentive, and having fewer facial expressions. About 13% of pregnant people take an antidepressant\nduring pregnancy. It is important that pregnant people taking antidepressants discuss the medication with a health care\nprovider as some medications can cause harm to the developing organism. In fact, birth defects are about 2 to 3 times\nmore likely in people who are prescribed certain Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) for their depression.\nPaternal impact. The age of fathers at the time of conception is\nalso an important factor in health risks for children. According\nto Nippoldt (2015) offspring of men over 40 face an increased\nrisk of miscarriage, autism, birth defects, achondroplasia (bone\ngrowth disorder) and schizophrenia. These increased health\nrisks are thought to be due to chromosomal aberrations and\nmutations that accumulate during the maturation of sperm\ncells in older men (Bray, Gunnell, & Smith, 2006). However, like\nolder women, the overall risks are small.\nIn addition, men are more likely than women to work in\noccupations where hazardous chemicals, many of which have Figure 3.10\nteratogenic effects or may cause genetic mutations, are used\n(Cordier, 2008). These may include petrochemicals, lead, and pesticides that can cause abnormal sperm and lead to\nmiscarriages or diseases. Men are also more likely to be a source of secondhand smoke for their developing offspring.\nAs noted earlier, smoking by either the mother or around the mother can impede prenatal development.\nAssessing the Neonate\nThe Apgar assessment is conducted at one minute and five\nminutes after birth. This is a very quick way to assess the\nnewborn\u2019s overall condition. Five measures are assessed: Heart\nrate, respiration, muscle tone (assessed by touching the baby\u2019s\npalm), reflex response (the Babinski reflex is tested), and color.\nA score of 0 to 2 is given on each feature examined. An Apgar\nof 5 or less is cause for concern. The second Apgar should\nindicate improvement with a higher score (see Figure 3.11).\nAnother way to assess the condition of the newborn is the\nNeonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). The baby\u2019s\nFigure 3.11\nmotor development, muscle tone, and stress response are\nassessed. This tool has been used around the world to further\nassess newborn, especially those with low Apgar scores, and to make comparisons of infants in different cultures\n(Brazelton & Nugent, 1995).\nProblems of the Newborn\n82 | Beginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development Anoxia. Anoxia is a temporary lack of oxygen to the brain.\nDifficulty during delivery may lead to anoxia which can result in\nbrain damage or in severe cases, death. Babies who suffer both\nlow birth weight and anoxia are more likely to suffer learning\ndisabilities later in life as well.\nLow birth weight. We have been discussing a number of\nteratogens associated with low birth weight such as alcohol,\ntobacco, and so on. A child is considered low birth weight if he\nor she weighs less than 5 pounds 8 ounces (2500 grams). About\n8.2 percent of babies born in the United States are of low birth\nweight (Center for Disease Control, 2015a). A low birth weight\nFigure 3.12. Newborn in neonatal unit\nbaby has difficulty maintaining adequate body temperature\nbecause it lacks the fat that would otherwise provide insulation.\nSuch babies are also at more risk for infection, and 67 percent of these babies are also preterm which can increase their\nrisk for respiratory infection. Very low birth weight babies (2 pounds or less) have an increased risk of developing\ncerebral palsy.\nAdditionally, Pettersson, Larsson, D\u2019Onofrio, Almqvist, and Lichtenstein (2019) analyzed fetal growth and found that\nreduced birth weight was correlated with a small, but significant increase in several psychiatric disorders in adulthood.\nThese include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nPettersson et al. theorized that \u201creduced fetal growth compromises brain development during a critical period, which\nin turn slightly increases the risk not only for neurodevelopmental disorders but also for virtually all mental health\nconditions\u201d (p. 540). An insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients for the developing fetus are proposed as factors that\nincreased the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.\nPreterm. A newborn might also have a low birth weight if it is born at less than 37 weeks gestation, which qualifies it as\na preterm baby (CDC, 2015c). Early birth can be triggered by anything that disrupts the mother\u2019s system. For instance,\nvaginal infections can lead to premature birth because such infection causes the mother to release anti-inflammatory\nchemicals which, in turn, can trigger contractions. Smoking and the use of other teratogens can lead to preterm birth.\nThe earlier a woman quits smoking, the lower the chance that the baby will be born preterm (Someji & Beltr\u00e1n-S\u00e1nchez,\n2019). A significant consequence of preterm birth includes respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by\nweak and irregular breathing (United States National Library of Medicine, 2015b).\nSaybie (name given to her by the hospital), a baby girl born in\nSan Diego, California is now considered the world\u2019s smallest\nbaby ever to survive (Chiu, 2019). She was born in December\n2018 at 23 weeks and 3 days weighing only 8.6 ounces (same size\nas an apple). After five months in the hospital, Saybie went\nhome in May 2019 weighing 5 pounds.\nSmall-for-date infants. Infants that have birth weights that are\nbelow expectation based on their gestational age are referred to\nFigure 3.13. Saybie as small-for-date. These infants may be full term or preterm,\nbut still weigh less than 90% of all babies of the same\ngestational age. This is a very serious situation for newborns as their growth was adversely affected. Regev et al. (2003)\nfound that small-for-date infants died at rates more than four times higher than other infants. Remember that many\ncauses of low birth weight and preterm births are preventable with proper prenatal care.\nBeginnings: Conception and Prenatal Development | 83 Supplemental Materials\n\u2022 This documentary follows four babies from different parts of the globe as they navigate their first year of life.\nBalm\u00e8s, T., Chabat, Alain, Billot, Amandine, Rouxel, Christine, Bertrand, Reynald, McKay, Craig, . . .

At each age, infants, children, adolescents, and adults,\nnegotiate target developmental tasks that are specific to that period of development. When the target task\nis negotiated successfully, it creates a foundation for future healthy development and provides a basis for the successful\nnegotiation of future developmental tasks. When a task is not well resolved, this makes continued healthy development\nmore difficult.\nThe developmental task of infancy is trust vs. mistrust, and it is negotiated in the establishment of a secure\nattachment relationship with the caregiver. Erikson maintained that during the first year to year and a half of life the\nmost important goal is the development of a basic sense of trust in one\u2019s caregivers (Erikson, 1982). Infants are\ndependent and must rely on others to meet their basic physical and psychological needs. A caregiver who consistently\nmeets these needs instills a sense of trust or the belief that the world is a trustworthy place. Caregivers should not worry\nabout overly indulging an infant\u2019s need for comfort, contact, or stimulation. Caregiver responsiveness communicates to\ninfants that their needs will be taken care of, and so is essential in supporting the development of a sense of trust.\nProblems establishing trust: Erikson (1982) believed that basic mistrust could interfere with many aspects of\npsychosocial development and make it more difficult to build love and fellowship with others. Consider the implications\nfor establishing trust if a caregiver is unavailable or is upset and ill-prepared to care for a child. Or if a child is born\nprematurely, is unwanted, or has physical problems that make him or her less attractive to a parent. Under these\ncircumstances, we cannot assume that the parent is going to care for the child in ways that support the development of\ntrust. As you will read later, it is possible to rework mental models of insecure early relationships, but close and caring\nrelationships with primary caregivers make it much easier for infants to negotiate this first developmental task.\nAttachment | 91 What Babies Come With\nNewborns are equipped with a number of reflexes which are involuntary movements in response to stimulation (see\nTable 3.2). Some of the more common reflexes, such as the sucking reflex and rooting reflex, are important to feeding.\nThe grasping and stepping reflexes are eventually replaced by more voluntary behaviors. Within the first few months of\nlife these reflexes disappear, while other reflexes, such as the eye-blink, swallowing, sneezing, gagging, and withdrawal\nreflex stay with us as they continue to serve important functions. Reflexes offer pediatricians insight into the maturation\nand health of the nervous system. In preterm infants and those with neurological impairments, some of these reflexes\nmay be absent at birth. Once present, they may persist longer than in a neurologically healthy infant (El-Dib, Massaro,\nGlass & Aly, 2012). Reflexes that persist longer than they should can impede normal development (Berne, 2006).\n92 | Attachment Table 3.2 Some Common Infant Reflexes\nAttachment | 93 Reflex Description Image\nSucking Suck on anything that touches the lips\nRooting Turning the head when the cheek is touched\nGrasp Fingers automatically grip anything the touches the palm of the hand\nThe toes will fan out and curl when the sole of the foot is stroked from heel to\nBabinski\ntoe\n94 | Attachment Reflex Description Image\nA sudden noise or loss of support to the head will cause infants to spread out\nMoro\ntheir arms and legs then quickly contract the limbs inward\nWhen lying on the back with the head to one side infants will extend the arm\nTonic\nand leg on that side while flexing the limbs on the opposite side (looks like a\nNeck\nfencer pose)\nStepping Legs move in stepping like motion when feet touch a smooth surface\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nAttachment | 95 Forming Attachments\nAttachment is a strong affectionate bond that binds an infant to a specific intimate\ncaregiver, and from which the infant derives a sense of security. The formation of\nattachments in infancy has been the subject of considerable research since\nattachments are viewed as foundations for future relationships. Additionally,\nattachments form the basis for confidence and curiosity as toddlers, and are\nimportant influences on self-concept.\nFreud\u2019s Psychoanalytic Theory. According to Freud (1938) infants are oral\ncreatures who obtain pleasure from sucking and mouthing objects. Freud believed\nthe infant will become attached to a person or object that provides this pleasure.\nConsequently, infants were believed to become attached to their mother because\nshe was the one who satisfied their oral needs and provided pleasure. Freud\nfurther believed that infants will become attached to their mothers \u201cif the mother\nis relaxed and generous in her feeding practices, thereby allowing the child a lot\nof oral pleasure,\u201d (Shaffer, 1985, p. 435). Was Freud correct in his explanation for\nwhy infants became attached?\nHarlow\u2019s Research. In a classic study testing whether feeding was the most\nFigure 3.14. Mutually enjoyable\ninteractions promote infant bonding important factor in attachment, Wisconsin University psychologists Harry and\nMargaret Harlow investigated the responses of young monkeys. Infant monkeys\nwere separated from their biological mothers, and two surrogate mothers were introduced into their cages. One, the\nwire mother, consisted of a round wooden head, a mesh of cold metal wires, and a bottle of milk from which the baby\nmonkey could drink. The second mother was a foam-rubber form wrapped in a heated terry-cloth blanket. The infant\nmonkeys went to the wire mother for food, but they overwhelmingly preferred and spent significantly more time with\nthe warm terry-cloth mother. The warm terry-cloth mother provided no food but did provide comfort (Harlow, 1958).\nThe infant\u2019s need for physical closeness and touching is referred to as contact comfort. Contact comfort is believed to be\nthe foundation for attachment. The Harlows\u2019 studies confirmed that babies have social as well as physical needs. Both\nmonkeys and human babies need a secure base that allows them to feel safe. From this base, they can gain the\nconfidence they need to venture out and explore their worlds.\nBowlby\u2019s Theory. Building on the work of ethologists (who study animal behavior under natural conditions), John Bowlby\ndeveloped a theory of attachment. He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the\ncaregiver (Bowlby, 1969). This bond provides a basis for normal neurophysiological, social, and emotional development.\nIn addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues throughout life. He used the\nconcept of a secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child (Bowlby, 1982). A secure base is a\nparental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as the child explores the surroundings.\nBowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be responsive to the child\u2019s\nphysical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions\n(Bowlby, 1969). Additionally, Bowlby observed that infants would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from\ntheir parents, such as crying, refusing to be comforted, and waiting for the caregiver to return. He observed that these\nsame expressions were common to many other mammals, and consequently argued that these negative responses to\nseparation serve an evolutionary function. Because mammalian infants cannot feed or protect themselves, they are\ndependent upon the care and protection of adults for survival. Thus, those infants who were able to maintain proximity\nto an attachment figure were more likely to survive and reproduce.\n96 | Attachment Four Stages of Attachment\nPlease watch the video below for a description of the four developmental stages of attachment.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:\nhttps://pdx.pressbooks.pub/humandevelopment/?p=50#oembed-1\nMary Ainsworth and the Strange Situation Technique\nDevelopmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, continued studying the development of\nattachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test that measured an infant\u2019s attachment\nto his or her parent. The test is called The Strange Situation Technique because it is conducted in a context that is\nunfamiliar to the child and therefore likely to heighten the child\u2019s need for his or her parent (Ainsworth, 1979).\nDuring the procedure, that lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left alone, while the infant explores\nthe room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and talks for a minute to the parent, after which the parent\nleaves the room. The stranger stays with the infant for a few minutes, and then the parent again enters, and the stranger\nleaves the room. During the entire session, a video camera records the child\u2019s behaviors, which are later coded by trained\ncoders. The investigators were especially interested in how the child responded to the caregiver leaving and returning\nto the room, referred to as the \u201creunion.\u201d On the basis of their behaviors, the children are categorized into one of four\ngroups where each group reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver. One style is secure and\nthe other three styles are referred to as insecure.\n\u2022 A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the caregiver is present and may engage with\nthe stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and bring one to the caregiver to show and describe from\ntime to time. The child may be upset when the caregiver departs but is also happy to see the caregiver return.\n\u2022 A child with a resistant (sometimes called ambivalent) attachment style is wary about the situation in general,\nparticularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the caregiver rather than exploring the toys. When the\ncaregiver leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may\nrush to the caregiver, but then fails to be comforted when picked up. The child may still be angry and even resist\nattempts to be soothed.\n\u2022 A child with an avoidant attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little emotion when the\nmother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother when she approaches. The child will not\nexplore very much, regardless of who is there, and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the\nmother.\n\u2022 A child with a disorganized/disoriented attachment style seems to have an inconsistent way of coping with the\nstress of the strange situation. The child may cry during the separation, but avoid the mother when she returns, or\nthe child may approach the mother but then freeze or fall to the floor.\nAttachment | 97 Table 3.3 Strange Situation\nStages Event Secure Insecure-Avoidant Insecure-Resistant Insecure-Disorganized\nExploration with caregiver High exploration,\n1 Explores freely Stays close to caregiver Chaotic exploration\nin room but unfocused\nStranger enters room and May interact Indifferent to Afraid of stranger when Afraid or uncertain\n2\ntalks with caregiver with stranger stranger caregiver present about stranger\nCaregiver leaves room and May be upset\nNot upset when High distress when alone Unpredictable (may be\n3 child is left alone with when caregiver\ncaregiver leaves with stranger upset or not)\nstranger leaves\nHappy to see Ambivalent: wants contact\nIgnores or avoids Reacts to return of\n4 Reunion with caregiver caregiver with caregiver but is upset\ncaregiver caregiver with distress\nreturn at them\nHow common are the attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated that about 65 percent of\nchildren in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent exhibit avoidant styles and 10 to 15 percent are\nambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be characterized as disorganized (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978).\nSome cultural differences in attachment styles have been found\n(Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2000). For example,\nGerman parents value independence and Japanese mothers are\ntypically by their children\u2019s sides. As a result, the rate of\ninsecure-avoidant attachments is higher in Germany and\ninsecure-resistant attachments are higher in Japan. These\ndifferences reflect cultural variation rather than true insecurity,\nhowever (van Ijzendoorn and Sagi, 1999). Overall, secure\nattachment is the most common type of attachment seen in\nevery culture studied thus far (Thompson, 2006).\nCaregiver Interactions and the Formation of Attachment\nMost developmental psychologists argue that a child becomes\nsecurely attached when there is consistent contact from one or\nmore caregivers who meet the physical and emotional needs of\nthe child in a responsive and appropriate manner. However,\nFigure 3.15\neven in cultures where mothers do not talk, cuddle, and play\nwith their infants, secure attachments can develop (LeVine et.\nal., 1994).\nThe insecure resistant (or ambivalent) style occurs when the parent is insensitive and responds inconsistently to the\nchild\u2019s needs. Consequently, the infant is never sure that the world is a trustworthy place or that he or she can rely on\nothers without some anxiety. A caregiver who is unavailable, perhaps because of marital tension, substance abuse, or\npreoccupation with work, may send a message to the infant he or she cannot rely on having needs met. An infant who\nreceives only sporadic attention when experiencing discomfort may not learn how to calm down. The child may cry if\nseparated from the caregiver and also cry upon their return. They seek constant reassurance that never seems to satisfy\ntheir doubt. Keep in mind that clingy behavior can also just be part of a child\u2019s natural disposition or temperament and\ndoes not necessarily reflect some kind of parental neglect. Additionally, a caregiver that attends to a child\u2019s frustration\ncan help teach them to be calm and to relax.\nThe insecure avoidant style is marked by insecurity, but this style is also characterized by a tendency to avoid contact\n98 | Attachment with the caregiver and with others. This child may have learned that needs typically go unmet and learns that the\ncaregiver does not provide care and cannot be relied upon for comfort, even sporadically. An insecure avoidant child\nlearns to be more independent and disengaged.\nThe insecure disorganized/disoriented style represents the most insecure style of attachment and occurs when the\nchild is given mixed, confused, and inappropriate responses from the caregiver. For example, a mother who suffers\nfrom schizophrenia may laugh when a child is hurting or cry when a child exhibits joy. The child does not learn how\nto interpret emotions or to connect with the unpredictable caregiver. This type of attachment is also often seen in\nchildren who have been abused. Research has shown that abuse disrupts a child\u2019s ability to regulate their emotions (Main\n& Solomon, 1990).\nSupport for caregivers. Sometimes parents need help in\nresponding consistently to their infant\u2019s needs. A positive and\nstrong support group can help a parent and child build a strong\nfoundation by offering assistance and positive attitudes toward\nthe newborn and parent. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch\nresearcher van den Boom (1994) randomly assigned some\nbabies\u2019 mothers to a training session in which they learned to\nbetter respond to their children\u2019s needs. The research found\nthat these mothers\u2019 babies were more likely to show a secure\nattachment style in comparison to the mothers in a control\ngroup that did not receive training.\nFig 3.16 Social Deprivation. Severe deprivation of parental attachment\ncan lead to serious problems. Infants who, perhaps because of\nbeing in orphanages with inadequate care, have not had the opportunity to attach in infancy may still form initial secure\nattachments several years later. However, they may have more emotional problems of depression, anger, or be overly\nfriendly as they interact with others (O\u2019Connor et. al., 2003). According to studies of children who have not been given\nwarm, nurturing care, they may show developmental delays, failure to thrive, and attachment disorders (Bowlby, 1982).\nNon-organic failure to thrive is the diagnosis for an infant who does not grow, develop, or gain weight on schedule and\nthere is no known medical explanation for this failure. Poverty, neglect, inconsistent parenting, and severe family\ndysfunction are correlated with non-organic failure to thrive. In addition, postpartum depression can cause even a well-\nintentioned mother to neglect her infant.\nReactive Attachment Disorder: Children who experience social neglect or deprivation, repeatedly change primary\ncaregivers that limit opportunities to form stable attachments or are reared in unusual settings (such as institutions)\nthat limit opportunities to form stable attachments can certainly have difficulty forming attachments. According to\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), those\nchildren experiencing neglectful situations and also displaying markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate\nattachment behavior, such as being inhibited and withdrawn, minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others,\nand limited positive affect, may be diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. This disorder often occurs with\ndevelopmental delays, especially in cognitive and language areas. Fortunately, the majority of severely neglected\nchildren do not develop reactive attachment disorder, which occurs in less than 10% of such children. The quality of the\ncaregiving environment after serious neglect affects the development of this disorder.\nAttachment | 99 Internal Working Models of Attachment\nAs research accumulated showing the long-term effects of the quality of attachment between young children and their\ncaregivers, researchers became very interested in the question of why \u2014 as in \u201cWhy does attachment at an early age\npredict later aspects of social, emotional, and cognitive development?\u201d To answer this question, they began exploring\npossible mediating mechanisms, looking for the pathways through which attachment exerts its effects. Research has\nuncovered several mechanisms, including neurophysiological pathways (e.g., children in securely attached dyads have\nlower levels of stress reactivity), but among the most interesting are young children\u2019s (and the later older children\u2019s,\nadolescents\u2019, and adults\u2019) internal working models of close relationships (Crittenden, 1999; Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Main,\nKaplan, & Cassidy, 1985).\nAs attachment develops, day-to-day interactions between infant and caregiver form the basis of the infant\u2019s internal\nworking model \u2013 a set of beliefs and expectations they build about the availability and reliability of their attachment\nfigures (Sherman, Rice, & Cassidy, 2015). These internal working models are constructed starting at a very young age,\nabout the age of four months, as soon as children have the capacity to mentally represent their experiences. It is as if\nover the first few years of life infants are \u201ctaking mental notes\u201d about how these important relationships function, and\nthe effects of these expectations can be seen in the ways infants wait after sending out distress signals to see if their\ncaregiver is on the way or they need to escalate their communications. The specific, repeated experiences babies have\nwith their caregivers become more generalized and internalized over time, indicating whether the attachment figure\ncan be counted on for dependable comfort and protection in times of distress, and so can serve as a secure base from\nwhich the infant can explore the world. This inner representation then informs what types of behavior can be expected\nfrom others, i.e., whether a person will pick them up when they are upset or should be turned to for comfort when they\nare sad.\nAs children start to interact and form relationships with others, like other family members, preschool teachers, and\npeers, their internal working models forms the basis of their expectations for how people will respond to them, and\ntherefore shape their own behavior in relationships. Negative experiences with one caregiver may, for example, create\nthe expectation that people are not to be trusted, and so young children are less able to be their authentic selves, or\nreach out to others when they are upset and need comfort. Because these internal working models influence children\u2019s\nbehavior, they may shape the quality of their subsequent relationships, all the way up until adolescence and young\nadulthood (Allen & Miga, 2010). For example, adolescents with insecure-resistant internal working models may show\nambivalence about close romantic relationships, both intensely wanting them but also being resentful about the extent\nto which their needs are being met (Mikulincer, Shaver, Bar-On, & Ein-Dor, 2010).\nThough these inner representations tend to stay somewhat stable for children with secure attachments, they can\ncontinue to grow and change as children age and gather more social experiences. For example, consistent, warm, and\ncaring interactions with other attachment figures, such as grandmothers or preschool teachers, have the power to\nchange those beliefs allowing children to rework a negative internal working model into a positive one. Internal working\nmodels can be reworked at any age, as children encounter family members, neighbors, teachers or other adults who\nprovide high quality care. For adolescents, close and caring friendships can provide opportunities to reconsider and\nexpand their understanding of relationships. The good news is that, as adults, we can become aware of our own internal\nworking models of relationships and see how we may be bringing things from previous relationships into subsequent\nones, in ways that are causing us problems. Then we can intentionally rework our expectations about others in ways that\nmake it easier for us to form secure relationships with our friends, romantic partners, and eventually our own children.\n100 | Attachment References\nAinsworth, M.

If infants have\nbuilt a secure attachment with caregivers, they can use that secure base to explore the world and establish themselves\nas independent persons, with their own goals and interests. It is the job of the toddler to exert his or her will, and to\ntest the limits of what can be touched, said, and explored. Erikson (1982) believed that toddlers should be encouraged\nto explore their environments as freely as safety allows, and in so doing develop a sense of independence that will\nlater grow to support self-esteem, initiative, and confidence. If a caregiver is overly anxious about the toddler\u2019s actions\nfor fear that the child will get hurt or is overly critical and controlling about the mistakes they make, the child will\nget the message that he or she should be ashamed of who they are and instill a sense of doubt in their capacities.\nParenting advice based on these ideas would be to keep toddlers safe but to validate their desires for exploration and\nindependence, and to encourage them to learn by doing.\nTemperament\nPerhaps you have spent time with a number of infants. How were they alike? How did they differ? How do you\ncompare with your siblings or other children you have known well? Have you heard stories from your parents or\ngrandparents about what you were like as a baby? If you have any videos of yourself as a baby, how do you seem to be\nregarding the world? You may have noticed that some infants seem to be more comfortable or sociable or in a better\nmood than others, and that some are more sensitive to noise or more easily distracted than others. These differences\nmay be attributed to temperament. Temperament refers to innate neurophysiologically-based characteristics of infants,\nincluding mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth.\nIn a landmark study started in 1956, Chess and Thomas (1996) evaluated 141 children\u2019s temperament based on parental\ninterviews. Referred to as the New York Longitudinal Study, infants were assessed on 9 dimensions of temperament\nincluding: activity level, rhythmicity (regularity of biological functions), approach/withdrawal (how children deal with\nTemperament | 103 new things), adaptability to situations, intensity of reactions, threshold of responsiveness (how intense a stimulus has to\nbe for the child to react), quality of mood, distractibility, attention span, and persistence. Based on the infants\u2019 behavioral\nprofiles, they were categorized into three general types of temperament:\n\u2022 Easy Child (40%) who is able to quickly adapt to routine and new situations, remains calm, is easy to soothe, and\nusually is in a positive mood.\n\u2022 Difficult Child (10%) who reacts negatively to new situations, has trouble adapting to routine, is usually negative in\nmood, and cries frequently.\n\u2022 Slow-to-Warm-Up Child (15%) has a low activity level, adjusts slowly to new situations and is often negative in\nmood.\nTable 3.4 Types of Temperament\nType Percentage Description\n- Able to quickly adapt to routine and new situations\n- Remains calm\nEasy 40%\n- Easy to soothe\n- Usually in positive mood\n- Reacts negatively to new situations\n- Has trouble adapting to routine\nDifficult 10%\n- Usually negative in mood\n- Cries frequently\n- Low activity level\nSlow-to-warm 15% - Adjusts slowly to new situations\n- Often negative in mood\nAs can be seen the percentages do not equal 100% as some children were not able to be placed neatly into one of\nthe categories. No single type of temperament is invariably good or bad, however, infants with difficult temperaments\nare more likely than other babies to develop emotional problems, especially if their mothers are depressed or anxious\n(Garthus-Niegel et al., 2017). Children\u2019s long-term adjustment actually depends on the goodness-of-fit of their particular\ntemperament to the nature and demands of the environment in which they find themselves. Therefore, what appears to be\nmore important than child temperament is how caregivers respond to it.\nThink about how you might approach each type of child in order to improve your interactions with them. An easy or\nflexible child will not need much extra attention unless you want to find out whether they are having difficulties that\nhave gone unnoticed. A slow-to-warm-up child may need to be given advance warning if new people or situations\nare going to be introduced. A difficult or feisty child may need to be given extra time to burn off their energy. A\ncaregiver\u2019s ability to accurately read and work well with the child will determine the goodness-of-fit between the\nchild\u2019s temperament and parenting. The goal for parents to provide a good fit or a good match, meaning their styles align\nwell and communication and interaction can flow. The temperamentally active children can do well with parents who\nsupport their curiosity but could have problems in a more rigid family.\nIt is this goodness-of-fit between child temperament and parental demands and expectations that can cause struggles.\nRather than believing that discipline alone will bring about improvements in children\u2019s behavior, our knowledge of\ntemperament may help a parent, teacher or other caregiver gain insight to work more effectively with a child. It\nis helpful to view temperamental differences as varying styles that can be responded to accordingly, as opposed to\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 behavior. For example, a persistent child may be difficult to distract from forbidden things such as\nelectrical cords, but this persistence may serve her well in other areas such as problem-solving. Positive traits can be\n104 | Temperament enhanced and negative traits can be channeled. The child\u2019s underlying style of reaction, however, is unlikely to change.\nTemperament doesn\u2019t change dramatically as we grow up, but if we are lucky, we learn how to work with and manage\nour temperamental qualities.\nParenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents affect their children, children influence their parents. Child\ncharacteristics, such as temperament, affect parenting behaviors and roles. For example, an infant with an easy\ntemperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and\ncooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive reactions from his or her parents and may result\nin parents feeling less effective in the parenting role (Eisenberg et al., 2008). Over time, parents of more difficult children\nmay become more punitive and less patient with their children (Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999;\nKiff, Lengua, & Zalewski, 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have\ngreater challenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith, 2004). Thus, child temperament\nis one of the child characteristics that influences how parents behave with their children.\nTemperament and later personality. Temperament is largely biologically based, although that does not mean that it is\ngenetically determined. Even at birth, a newborn\u2019s neurophysiology has been shaped by the prenatal environment and\nbirth process they experience. Moreover, during the first few months of life, the quality of an infant\u2019s attachment and\ntheir experience of early adversity can have marked neurophysiological effects. Even if temperament does not change\ndramatically as we grow up, it may be modulated as one contributor to our childhood and adult personality. In contrast\nto temperament, personality, defined as an individual\u2019s consistent pattern of feeling, thinking, and behaving, is the result\nof the continuous interplay between this initial biological disposition and experience.\nPersonality also develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, & Goodvin, 2010). As children mature\nbiologically, temperamental characteristics are woven into subsequent developments. For example, a newborn with\nhigh reactivity may show high levels of impulsive behavior, but as brain-based capacities for self-control mature, these\nnewfound regulatory capacities may reduce impulsive behavior. Or, a newborn who cries frequently does not necessarily\nhave a grumpy personality; over time, with sufficient parental support and an increased sense of security, the child\nmight be less likely to experience and express distress.\nIn addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children\u2019s developing self-concept,\ntheir motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals, their coping styles, their sense of responsibility\nand conscientiousness, and many other qualities are encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by\nbiological dispositions, but even more by the child\u2019s experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that\nguide the growth of individual characteristics. Indeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations\nof temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn that parents gazed\nupon becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance.\nInfant Emotions\nAt birth, infants exhibit two emotional responses: Attraction and withdrawal. They show attraction to pleasant situations\nthat bring comfort, stimulation, and pleasure, and they withdraw from unpleasant stimulation such as bitter flavors\nor physical discomfort. At around two months, infants exhibit social engagement in the form of social smiling as they\nrespond with joy to those who engage their positive attention (Lavelli & Fogel, 2005).\nTemperament | 105 Social smiling becomes more stable and organized as infants\nlearn to use their smiles to engage their parents in\ninteractions. Pleasure is expressed as laughter at 3 to 5 months\nof age, and displeasure becomes more specific and\ndifferentiated as fear, sadness, or anger between ages 6 and 8\nmonths. Anger or frustration is often expressed in reaction to\nbeing prevented from obtaining a goal, such as a toy being\nremoved (Braungart-Rieker, Hill-Soderlund, & Karrass, 2010).\nIn contrast, sadness is typically the response when infants are\ndeprived of a caregiver (Papousek, 2007). Fear is often\nassociated with the presence of a stranger, known as stranger\nwariness, or the departure of significant others known as\nseparation anxiety. Both appear sometime between 6 and 15\nmonths after object permanence has been acquired. Further,\nthere is some indication that infants may experience jealousy\nas young as 6 months of age (Hart & Carrington, 2002).\nFigure 3.17 Emotions are often divided into two general categories: Basic\nemotions, such as interest, happiness, anger, fear, surprise,\nsadness and disgust, which appear first, and self-conscious emotions, such as envy, pride, shame, guilt, doubt, and\nembarrassment. Unlike primary emotions, secondary emotions appear as children start to develop a self-concept and\nreceive social instruction on when to feel such emotions. The situations in which children learn self-conscious emotions\nvaries from culture to culture. Individualistic cultures teach us to feel pride in personal accomplishments, while in more\ncollective cultures children are taught to not call attention to themselves, unless you wish to feel embarrassed for doing\nso (Akimoto & Sanbinmatsu, 1999).\nFacial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the developmental literature, this has\nbeen investigated under the concept of social referencing; that is, the process whereby infants seek out information from\nothers to clarify a situation and then use that information to act (Klinnert, Campos, & Sorce, 1983). To date, the strongest\ndemonstration of social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff. In the first study to investigate this concept,\nSorce, Emde, Campos, and Klinnert (1985) placed mothers on the far end of the \u201ccliff\u201d from the infant. Mothers first\nsmiled to the infants and placed a toy on top of the safety glass to attract them; infants invariably began crawling to\ntheir mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the mother then intentionally displayed an\nexpression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results were clearly different for the different facial expressions;\nno infant crossed the table when the mother showed fear; only 6% did when the mother showed anger, 33% crossed\nwhen the mother showed sadness, and approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother expressed joy or\ninterest.\nOther studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction. Experimenters displayed\nfacial expressions of neutral, anger, or disgust toward babies as they moved toward an object and measured the amount\nof inhibition the babies showed in touching the object (Bradshaw, 1986). The results for 10- and 15-month olds were the\nsame: Anger produced the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least. This study was later replicated\nusing joy and disgust expressions, altering the method so that the infants were not allowed to touch the toy (compared\nwith a distractor object) until one hour after exposure to the expression (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004). At 14 months of\nage, significantly more infants touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched the toy when the\ninfants saw disgust.\nA final emotional change is in self-regulation. Emotional self-regulation refers to strategies we use to control our\nemotional states so that we can attain goals (Thompson & Goodvin, 2007). This requires effortful control of emotions\n106 | Temperament and initially requires assistance from caregivers (Rothbart, Posner, & Kieras, 2006). Young infants have very limited\ncapacity to adjust their emotional states and depend on their caregivers to help soothe themselves. Caregivers can\noffer distractions to redirect the infant\u2019s attention and comfort to reduce the emotional distress. As areas of the infant\u2019s\nprefrontal cortex continue to develop, infants can tolerate more stimulation. By 4 to 6 months, babies can begin to\nshift their attention away from upsetting stimuli (Rothbart et al, 2006). Older infants and toddlers can more effectively\ncommunicate their need for help and can crawl or walk toward or away from various situations (Cole, Armstrong,\n& Pemberton, 2010). This aids in their ability to self-regulate. Temperament also plays a role in children\u2019s ability to\ncontrol their emotional states, and individual differences have been noted in the emotional self-regulation of infants and\ntoddlers (Rothbart & Bates, 2006).\nDevelopment of sense of self. During the second year of life, children\nbegin to recognize themselves as they gain a sense of self as object. In a\nclassic experiment by Lewis and Brooks (1978) children 9 to 24 months of\nage were placed in front of a mirror after a spot of rouge was placed on\ntheir nose as their mothers pretended to wipe something off the child\u2019s\nface. If the child reacted by touching his or her own nose rather that of the\n\u201cbaby\u201d in the mirror, it was taken to suggest that the child recognized the\nreflection as him- or herself. Lewis and Brooks found that somewhere\nbetween 15 and 24 months most infants developed a sense of self-\nawareness. Self-awareness is the realization that you are separate from\nothers (Kopp, 2011). Once a child has achieved self-awareness, the child is\nmoving toward understanding social emotions such as guilt, shame or\nembarrassment, as well as, sympathy or empathy.\nFigure 3.18\nReferences\nAkimoto, S.

As mentioned during the prenatal section, development occurs according to the\nCephalocaudal (from head to tail) and Proximodistal (from the midline outward) principles. For instance, babies first\nlearn to hold their heads up, then to sit with assistance, then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling, pulling\nup, cruising or walking while holding on to something, and then unassisted walking (Eisenberg, Murkoff, & Hathaway,\n1989). As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve. For each\nmilestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be reached. An example of a\ndevelopmental milestone is a baby holding up its head. Babies on average are able to hold up their heads at 6 weeks old,\nand 90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months. Sitting\ninvolves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between 5 and 9 months old.\nIf the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent or caregiver should\ncheck in with the child\u2019s pediatrician. Developmental delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.\nMotor Skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Gross\nmotor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our head, torso, arms and\nlegs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping). These\nskills begin to develop first. Examples include moving to bring the chin up when\nlying on the stomach, moving the chest up, and rocking back and forth on hands\nand knees. But it also includes exploring an object with one\u2019s feet as many babies\ndo as early as 8 weeks of age if seated in a carrier or other device that frees the\nhips. This may be easier than reaching for an object with the hands, which\nrequires much more practice (Berk, 2007). Sometimes an infant will try to move\ntoward an object while crawling and surprisingly move backward because of the\ngreater amount of strength in the arms than in the legs.\nFine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable\ncoordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing with a pencil, and using\na spoon). Newborns cannot grasp objects voluntarily but do wave their arms\ntoward objects of interest. At about 4 months of age, the infant is able to reach for\nFigure 3.19. Infant displaying the palmer an object, first with both arms and within a few weeks, with only one arm. At this\ngrasp. age grasping an object involves the use of the fingers and palm, but no thumbs. This\nis known as the Palmer Grasp. The use of the thumb comes at about 9 months of age\nwhen the infant is able to grasp an object using the forefinger and thumb. Now the infant uses a Pincer Grasp, and this\nability greatly enhances the ability to control and manipulate an object. Infants take great delight in this newfound\nability. They may spend hours picking up small objects from the floor and placing them in containers. By 9 months, an\ninfant can also watch a moving object, reach for it as it approaches, and grab it.\nSensory Capacities\nThroughout much of history, the newborn was considered a passive, disorganized being who possessed minimal\n110 | Language & Cognition abilities. William James, an early psychologist, had described the newborn\u2019s world as \u201ca blooming, buzzing confusion\u201d\n(Shaffer, 1985). However, current research techniques have demonstrated just how developed the newborn is with\nespecially organized sensory and perceptual abilities.\nVision. The womb is a dark environment void of visual stimulation. Consequently, vision is one of the most poorly\ndeveloped senses at birth, and time is needed to build neural pathways between the eyes and the brain (American\nOptometric Association [AOA], 2019). Newborns typically cannot see further than 8 to 10 inches away from their faces\n(AOA, 2019). An 8-week old\u2019s vision is 20/300. This means an object 20 feet away from an infant has the same clarity as\nan object 300 feet away from an adult with normal vision. By 3-months visual acuity has sharpened to 20/200, which\nwould allow them the see the letter E at the top of a standard eye chart (Hamer, 2016). As a result, the world initially\nlooks blurry to young infants (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).\nWhy is visual acuity so poor in the infant? The fovea, which is the central field of vision in the retina and allows us to see\nsharp detail, is not fully developed at birth, and does not start to reach adult levels of development until 15 months (Li\n& Ding, 2017). Even by 45 months some of the sensory neurons (cones) of the fovea are still not fully grown. Can babies\nsee color? Young infants can perceive color, but the colors need to be very pure forms of basic colors, such as vivid red\nor green rather than weaker pastel shades. Most studies report that babies can see the full spectrum of colors by five\nmonths of age (AOA, 2019).\nNewborn infants prefer and orient to face-like stimuli more than they do other patterned stimuli (Farroni et al., 2005).\nThey also prefer images of faces that are upright and not scrambled (Chien, 2011). Infants also quickly learn to distinguish\nthe face of their mother from faces of other women (Bartrip, Morton, & De Schonen, 2001). When viewing a person\u2019s\nface, one-month olds fixate on the outer edges of the face rather than the eyes, nose, or mouth, but two-month olds\ngaze more at the inner features, especially the eyes (Hainline, 1978). Researchers have examined the development of\nattention and tracking in the visual system and have found the following for young infants:\n\u2022 One-month-olds have difficulty disengaging their attention and can spend several minutes fixedly gazing at a\nstimulus (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).\n\u2022 Aslin (1981) found that when tracking an object visually, the eye movements of newborns and one-month olds are\nnot smooth but saccadic, that is step-like jerky movements. Aslin also found that eye movements lag behind an\nobject\u2019s motion. This means young infants do not anticipate the trajectory of the object. By two months of age,\ntheir eye movements are becoming smoother, but they still lag behind the motion of the object and will not\nachieve this until about three to four months of age (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).\n\u2022 Newborns also orient more to the visual field toward the side of the head, than to the visual field on either side of\nthe nose (Lewis, Maurer, & Milewski, 1979). By two to three months, stimuli in both fields are now attended to\nequally (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).\nBinocular vision, which requires input from both eyes, is evident around the third month and continues to develop during\nthe first six months (Atkinson & Braddick, 2003). By six months infants can perceive depth perception in pictures as well\n(Sen, Yonas, & Knill, 2001). Infants who have experience crawling and exploring will pay greater attention to visual cues\nof depth and modify their actions accordingly (Berk, 2007).\nLanguage & Cognition | 111 Hearing. The infant\u2019s sense of hearing is very keen at birth, and\nthe ability to hear is evidenced as soon as the seventh month of\nprenatal development. Newborns prefer their mother\u2019s voices\nover another female even if speaking the same material\n(DeCasper & Fifer, 1980). Additionally, they will register in utero\nspecific information heard from their mother\u2019s voice. DeCasper\nand Spence (1986) tested 16 infants (average age of 55.8 hours)\nwhose mothers had previously read to them prenatally. The\nmothers read several passages to their fetuses, including the\nfirst 28 paragraphs of the Cat in the Hat, beginning when they\nwere 7 months pregnant. The fetuses had been exposed to the\nstories an average of 67 times or 3.5 hours. When the\nexperimental infants were tested, the target stories (previously\nheard) were more reinforcing than the novel story as measured\nby their rate of sucking. However, for control infants, the target Figure 3.20\nstories were not more reinforcing than the novel story\nindicating that the experimental infants had heard them before.\nAn infant can distinguish between very similar sounds as early as one month after birth and can distinguish between\na familiar and non-familiar voice even earlier. Infants are especially sensitive to the frequencies of sounds in human\nspeech and prefer the exaggeration of infant-directed speech, which will be discussed later. Additionally, infants are\ninnately ready to respond to the sounds of any language, but between six and nine months they show preference for\nlistening to their native language (Jusczyk, Cutler, & Redanz, 1993). Their ability to distinguish the sounds that are not in\nthe language around them diminishes rapidly (Cheour-Luhtanen, et al., 1995).\nTouch and pain. Immediately after birth, a newborn is sensitive to touch and temperature, and is also highly sensitive\nto pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular responses (Balaban & Reisenauer, 2013). Newborns who are\ncircumcised, which is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis, without anesthesia experience pain as\ndemonstrated by increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of\nstress hormones (United States National Library of Medicine, 2016). Research has demonstrated that infants who were\ncircumcised without anesthesia experienced more pain and fear during routine childhood vaccines. Fortunately, today\nmany local pain killers are currently used during circumcision.\nTaste and smell. Studies of taste and smell demonstrate that\nbabies respond with different facial expressions, suggesting\nthat certain preferences are innate. Newborns can distinguish\nbetween sour, bitter, sweet, and salty flavors and show a\npreference for sweet flavors. Newborns also prefer the smell of\ntheir mothers. An infant only 6 days old is significantly more\nlikely to turn toward its own mother\u2019s breast pad than to the\nbreast pad of another baby\u2019s mother (Porter, Makin, Davis, &\nChristensen, 1992), and within hours of birth an infant also\nshows a preference for the face of its own mother (Bushnell,\n2001; Bushnell, Sai, & Mullin, 1989).\nFigure 3.21 Intermodality. Infants seem to be born with the ability to\nperceive the world in an intermodal way; that is, through\nstimulation from more than one sensory modality. For example, infants who sucked on a pacifier with either a smooth or\ntextured surface preferred to look at a corresponding (smooth or textured) visual model of the pacifier. By 4 months,\n112 | Language & Cognition infants can match lip movements with speech sounds and can match other audiovisual events. Sensory processes\nare certainly affected by the infant\u2019s developing motor abilities (Hyv\u00e4rinen, Walthes, Jacob, Nottingham Chapin, &\nLeonhardt, 2014). Reaching, crawling, and other actions allow the infant to see, touch, and organize his or her\nexperiences in new ways.\nHow are infants tested. Habituation procedures, that is measuring decreased responsiveness to a stimulus after repeated\npresentations, have increasingly been used to evaluate infants in studies of the development of perceptual and memory\nskills. Phelps (2005) describes a habituation procedure used when measuring the rate of the sucking reflex. Researchers\nfirst measure the initial baseline rate of sucking to a pacifier equipped with transducers that measure muscle\ncontractions. Next, an auditory stimulus is presented, such as a human voice uttering a speech sound such as \u201cda.\u201d The\nrate of sucking will typically increase with the new sound, but then decrease to baseline levels as \u201cda\u201d is repeatedly\npresented, showing habituation. If the sound \u201cma\u201d was then presented, the rate of sucking would again increase,\ndemonstrating that the infant can discriminate between these two stimuli.\nAdditionally, the speed or efficiency with which infants show habituation has been shown to predict outcomes in\nbehaviors, such as language acquisition and verbal and nonverbal intelligence. Infants who show difficulty during\nhabituation, or habituate at slower than normal rates, have been found to be at an increased risk for significant\ndevelopmental delays. Infants with Down syndrome, teratogen-exposed infants, malnourished infants, and premature\ninfants have all been studied. Researchers have found that at the age of 16 months, high-risk infants show rates of\nhabituation comparable to newborn infants (Phelps, 2005).\nLearning Objectives: Cognitive Development in Infancy and Toddlerhood\n\u2022 Explain the Piagetian concepts of schema, assimilation, and accommodation.\n\u2022 List and describe the six substages of sensorimotor intelligence.\n\u2022 Describe the characteristics of infant memory.\n\u2022 Describe components and developmental progression of language.\n\u2022 Identify and compare the theories of language.\nPiaget and the Sensorimotor Stage\nPiaget believed that children, even infants, actively try to make sense of their environments. He viewed intelligence,\nnot as knowledge or facts we acquire, but as the processes through which we adapt to our environment. He argued that\ndifferences between children and adults are not based on the fact that children know less than adults, but because they\nthink in different ways the adults do. Piaget used the clinical method in which he closely observed individual children in\ngreat detail over long periods of time in their natural environment. From these observations he developed his theory of\ncognitive development, which posits four qualitatively different stages (Piaget, 1954).\nSchema, assimilation and accommodation. In addition to descriptions of different stages, Piaget was also very\ninterested in the processes by which people come to understand the world (and in the process, to understand\nLanguage & Cognition | 113 themselves). He was focused on universal physical properties of environments, like time, space, and causality, which he\ncalled logic-mathematical thought. He argued that people make sense of the world by interacting with it. He assumed\nthat all people, even infants, are active, curious, energetic, and intrinsically motivated, and it is through their active\nattempts to \u201cmake things happen\u201d that they learn about natural laws. Piaget held that, as they go, infants and children\nconstruct models of how the world works, which are partial, incomplete, and not totally correct. He called these models,\nschema, which an be thought of as frameworks for organizing information. As we continue interacting with the world, we\nkeep trying out our mental models, and eventually encounter experiences that contradict them. These contradictions\nallow us to revise our models so that they can better account for the interactions we are experiencing. As models are\nrevised, they are more adaptive\u2013 meaning that they guide our actions more effectively as we try to reach our goals.\nChildren develop their models, that is, their schemata, through processes of assimilation and accommodation. When\nfaced with something new, a child may demonstrate assimilation, which is fitting the new information into an existing\nschema, such as calling all animals with four legs \u201cdoggies\u201d because he or she has the concept of doggie. When it\nbecomes clear that the new information no longer fits into the old schema, instead of assimilating the information,\nthe child may demonstrate accommodation, which is expanding the framework of knowledge to accommodate the new\nsituation and thus learning a new concept to more accurately name the animal. For example, recognizing that a horse\nis different than a zebra means the child has accommodated, and now the child has both a zebra schema and a horse\nschema. Even as adults we continue to try and \u201cmake sense\u201d of new situations by determining whether they fit into our\nold way of thinking (assimilation) or whether we need to modify our thoughts (accommodation).\n114 | Language & Cognition Figure 3.22\nPiaget also described a process of organization, in which we combine existing schemes into new and more complex\nones. By grouping and re-arranging schemas, and connecting them together, we can grow and refine our knowledge\nstructures. Finally, he pointed to the process of disequilibration, where we detect discrepancies or contradictions\nbetween the models we are constructing and the experiences we are having in our interactions with the world.\nThese contradictions can produce confusion or frustration, but they are developmentally helpful, because they lead\nto attempts to readjust actions and models so they are in better alignment, though a process called equilibration.\nDisequilibration and equilibration can also be applied to models themselves, as we detect that sub-parts of models\ncontradict each other or are not in alignment. Though processes of equilibration we can re-organize models so that\nthey are more internally consistent and coherent.\nCognitive development during infancy. Piaget\u2019s theories revolutionized the way that developmentalists thought about\ninfants. He was one of the first researchers to argue that infants are intelligent and they are busily constructing\nLanguage & Cognition | 115 their own understandings of the world through their interactions with the environment. According to the Piagetian\nperspective, infants learn about the world primarily through their senses and motor abilities (Harris, 2005). These basic\nmotor and sensory abilities provide the foundation for the cognitive skills that will emerge during the subsequent stages\nof cognitive development. The first stage of cognitive development is referred to as the sensorimotor stage and it occurs\nthrough six substages. Table 3.5 identifies the ages typically associated with each substage.\nTable 3.5 Infant Ages for the Six Substages of the Sensorimotor Stage\nSubstage 1 Reflexes (0\u20131 month)\nSubstage 2 Primary Circular Reactions (1\u20134 months)\nSubstage 3 Secondary Circular Reactions (4\u20138 months)\nSubstage 4 Coordination of Secondary Circular Reactions (8\u201312 months)\nSubstage 5 Tertiary Circular Reactions (12\u201318 months)\nSubstage 6 Beginning of Representational Thought (18\u201324 months)\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nSubstage 1: Reflexes. Newborns learn about their world through the use of their reflexes, such as when sucking,\nreaching, and grasping. Eventually the use of these reflexes becomes more deliberate and purposeful.\nSubstage 2: Primary Circular Reactions. During these next 3 months, the infant begins to actively involve his or her\nown body in some form of repeated activity. An infant may accidentally engage in a behavior and find it interesting\nsuch as making a vocalization. This interest motivates the infant to try to do it again and helps the infant learn a new\nbehavior that originally occurred by chance. The behavior is identified as circular because of the repetition, and as\nprimary because it centers on the infant\u2019s own body.\nSubstage 3: Secondary Circular Reactions. The infant begins to\ninteract with objects in the environment. At first the infant\ninteracts with objects (e.g., a crib mobile) accidentally, but then\nthese contacts with the objects are deliberate and become a\nrepeated activity. The infant becomes more and more actively\nengaged in the outside world and takes delight in being able to\nmake things happen. Repeated motion brings particular interest\nas, for example, the infant is able to bang two lids together from\nthe cupboard when seated on the kitchen floor.\nSubstage 4: Coordination of Secondary Circular Reactions.\nThe infant combines these basic reflexes and simple behaviors Figure 3.23\nand uses planning and coordination to achieve a specific goal.\nNow the infant can engage in behaviors that others perform and anticipate upcoming events. Perhaps because of\ncontinued maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the infant become capable of having a thought and carrying out a\nplanned, goal-directed activity. For example, an infant sees a toy car under the kitchen table and then crawls, reaches,\nand grabs the toy. The infant is coordinating both internal and external activities to achieve a planned goal.\nSubstage 5: Tertiary Circular Reactions. The toddler is considered a \u201clittle scientist\u201d and begins exploring the world in a\ntrial-and-error manner, using both motor skills and planning abilities. For example, the child might throw her ball down\nthe stairs to see what happens. The toddler\u2019s active engagement in experimentation helps them learn about their world.\n116 | Language & Cognition Substage 6: Beginning of Representational Thought. The\nsensorimotor period ends with the appearance of symbolic or\nrepresentational thought. The toddler now has a basic\nunderstanding that objects can be used as symbols.\nAdditionally, the child is able to solve problems using mental\nstrategies, to remember something heard days before and\nrepeat it, and to engage in pretend play. This initial movement\nfrom a \u201chands-on\u201d approach to knowing about the world to the\nmore mental world of substage six marks the transition to\npreoperational thought.\nDevelopment of object permanence. A critical milestone\nduring the sensorimotor period is the development of object\nFigure 3.24\npermanence. Object permanence is the understanding that even\nif something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000). According to Piaget, young infants cannot\nrepresent objects mentally, so they do not remember it after it has been removed from sight. Piaget studied infants\u2019\nreactions when a toy was first shown to them and then hidden under a blanket. Infants who had already developed\nobject permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still existed, whereas infants who had\nnot developed object permanence would appear confused. Piaget emphasizes this construct because it is an objective\nway for children to demonstrate how they mentally represent their world. Children have typically acquired this\nmilestone by 8 months. Once toddlers have mastered object permanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they\nrealize that when someone leaves the room they are still in the world. Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look\nin appropriate places when you ask them to find objects.\nIn Piaget\u2019s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger anxiety,\nwhich is a fear of unfamiliar people (Crain, 2005). Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a\nstranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces, such as parents. Stranger\nanxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore, she cannot predict\nwhat her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.\nCritique of Piaget. Piaget thought that children\u2019s ability to understand objects, such as learning that a rattle makes a\nnoise when shaken, was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the environment.\nToday, developmental psychologists question the timetables Piaget laid out. Researchers have found that even very\nyoung children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with those objects (Baillargeon,\n1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, Piaget believed that infants did not fully master object\npermanence until substage 5 of the sensorimotor period (Thomas, 1979). However, infants seem to be able to recognize\nthat objects have permanence at much younger ages. Diamond (1985) found that infants show earlier knowledge if the\nwaiting period is shorter. At age 6 months, they retrieved the hidden object if their wait for retrieving the object is no\nlonger than 2 seconds, and at 7 months if the wait is no longer than 4 seconds.\nFigure. 3.25. In Baillargeon\u2019s (1987) study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an unobstructed track\nwith an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an obstruction.\nLanguage & Cognition | 117 Development of Memory during Infancy\nMemory requires the capacity to mentally represent experience, so it should not be surprising that infant memory is\nrather fleeting and fragile. As a result, older children and adults experience infantile amnesia, the inability to recall\nmemories from the first few years of life. Several hypotheses have been proposed for this amnesia. From the biological\nperspective, it has been suggested that infantile amnesia is due to the immaturity of the infant brain, especially those\nareas that are crucial to the formation of autobiographical memory, such as the hippocampus. From the cognitive\nperspective, it has been suggested that the lack of linguistic skills of babies and toddlers limit their ability to mentally\nrepresent events; thereby, reducing their ability to encode memory. Moreover, even if infants do form such early\nmemories, older children and adults may not be able to access them because they may be employing very different,\nmore linguistically based, retrieval cues than infants used when forming largely photographic or visual memories.\nFinally, social theorists argue that episodic memories of personal experiences may hinge on an understanding of \u201cself\u201d,\nsomething that is clearly lacking in infants and young toddlers.\nHowever, in a series of clever studies Carolyn Rovee-Collier and her colleagues have demonstrated that infants can\nremember events from their life, even if these memories are short-lived. Three-month-old infants were taught that they\ncould make a mobile hung over their crib shake by kicking their legs. The infants were placed in their crib, on their backs.\nA ribbon was tied to one foot and the other end to a mobile. At first infants made random movements, but then came\nto realize that by kicking they could make the mobile shake. After two 9-minute sessions with the mobile, the mobile\nwas removed. One week later the mobile was reintroduced to one group of infants and most of the babies immediately\nstarted kicking their legs, indicating that they remembered their prior experience with the mobile. A second group\nof infants was shown the mobile two weeks later, and the babies made only random movements. The memory had\nfaded (Rovee-Collier, 1987; Giles & Rovee-Collier, 2011). Rovee-Collier and Hayne (1987) found that 3-month-olds could\nremember the mobile after two weeks if they were shown the mobile and watched it move, even though they were not\ntied to it. This reminder helped most infants to remember the connection between their kicking and the movement\nof the mobile. Like many researchers of infant memory, Rovee-Collier (1990) found infant memory to be very context\ndependent. In other words, the sessions with the mobile and the later retrieval sessions had to be conducted under very\nsimilar circumstances or else the babies would not remember their prior experiences with the mobile. For instance, if\nthe first mobile had had yellow blocks with blue letters, but at the later retrieval session the blocks were blue with yellow\nletters, the babies would not kick.\nInfants older than 6 months of age can retain information for longer periods of time; they also need less reminding to\nretrieve information in memory. Studies of deferred imitation, that is, the imitation of actions after a time delay, can\noccur as early as six-months of age (Campanella & Rovee-Collier, 2005), but only if infants are allowed to practice the\nbehavior they were shown. By 12 months of age, infants no longer need to practice the behavior in order to retain the\nmemory for four weeks (Klein & Meltzoff, 1999).\nLanguage Development\nOur vast intelligence also allows us to have language, a system of communication that uses symbols in a regular way to\ncreate meaning. Language gives us the ability to communicate our thoughts to others by talking, reading, and writing.\nAlthough other species have at least some ability to communicate, as far as we know, none of them have language. There\nare many components of language that will now be reviewed.\nComponents of Language\nPhoneme: A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that makes a meaningful difference in a language. The word \u201cbit\u201d\n118 | Language & Cognition has three phonemes. In spoken languages, phonemes are produced by the positions and movements of the vocal tract,\nincluding our lips, teeth, tongue, vocal cords, and throat, whereas in sign languages phonemes are defined by the shapes\nand movement of the hands.\nThere are hundreds of unique phonemes that can be made by human speakers, but most languages only use a small\nsubset of the possibilities. English contains about 45 phonemes, whereas other languages have as few as 15 and others\nmore than 60. The Hawaiian language contains fewer phonemes as it includes only 5 vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) and 7\nconsonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, and w).\nInfants are born able to detect all phonemes, but they lose their ability to do so as they get older; by 10 months of\nage a child\u2019s ability to recognize phonemes becomes very similar to that of the adult speakers of the native language.\nPhonemes that were initially differentiated come to be treated as equivalent (Werker & Tees, 2002).\nMorpheme: Whereas phonemes are the smallest units of sound in language, a morpheme is a string of one or more\nphonemes that makes up the smallest units of meaning in a language. Some morphemes are prefixes and suffixes used to\nmodify other words. For example, the syllable \u201cre-\u201d as in \u201crewrite\u201d or \u201crepay\u201d means \u201cto do again,\u201d and the suffix \u201c-est\u201d as\nin \u201chappiest\u201d or \u201ccoolest\u201d means \u201cto the maximum.\u201d\nSemantics: Semantics refers to the set of rules we use to obtain meaning from morphemes. For example, adding \u201ced\u201d to\nthe end of a verb makes it past tense.\nSyntax: Syntax is the set of rules of a language by which we construct sentences. Each language has a different syntax.\nThe syntax of the English language requires that each sentence have a noun and a verb, each of which may be modified\nby adjectives and adverbs. Some syntaxes make use of the order in which words appear. For example, in English the\nmeaning of the sentence \u201cThe man bites the dog\u201d is different from \u201cThe dog bites the man.\u201d\nPragmatics: The social side of language is expressed through pragmatics, or how we communicate effectively and\nappropriately with others. Examples of pragmatics include turn-taking, staying on topic, volume and tone of voice, and\nappropriate eye contact.\nLastly, words do not possess fixed meanings, but change their interpretation as a function of the context in which they\nare spoken. We use contextual information, the information surrounding language, to help us interpret it. Examples\nof contextual information include our knowledge and nonverbal expressions, such as facial expressions, postures, and\ngestures. Misunderstandings can easily arise if people are not attentive to contextual information or if some of it is\nmissing, such as it may be in newspaper headlines or in text messages.\nLanguage Developmental Progression\nAn important aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. The order in which children learn language\nstructures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). Starting before birth, babies begin to develop\nlanguage and communication skills. At birth, babies recognize their mother\u2019s voice and can discriminate between the\nlanguage(s) spoken by their mothers and foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in\nsynchrony with audible language (Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens et al., 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).\nLanguage & Cognition | 119 Do newborns communicate? Of course, they do. They do not,\nhowever, communicate with the use of oral language. Instead,\nthey communicate their thoughts and needs with body posture\n(being relaxed or still), gestures, cries, and facial expressions. A\nperson who spends adequate time with an infant can learn\nwhich cries indicate pain and which ones indicate hunger,\ndiscomfort, or frustration.\nIntentional vocalizations. In terms of producing spoken\nlanguage, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a\none-syllable combination of a consonant and a vowel sound (e.g.,\ncoo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their own\nFigure 3.26\nlanguages. A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a\ndifferent tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or\nUrdu. These gurgling, musical vocalizations can serve as a source of entertainment to an infant who has been laid down\nfor a nap or seated in a carrier on a car ride. Cooing serves as practice for vocalization, as well as the infant hears the\nsound of his or her own voice and tries to repeat sounds that are entertaining. Infants also begin to learn the pace and\npause of conversation as they alternate their vocalization with that of someone else and then take their turn again when\nthe other person\u2019s vocalization has stopped.\nAt about four to six months of age, infants begin making even more elaborate vocalizations that include the sounds\nrequired for any language. Guttural sounds, clicks, consonants, and vowel sounds stand ready to equip the child with\nthe ability to repeat whatever sounds are characteristic of the language heard. Eventually, these sounds will no longer\nbe used as the infant grows more accustomed to a particular language.\nAt about 7 months, infants begin babbling, engaging in intentional vocalizations that lack specific meaning and comprise\na consonant-vowel repeated sequence, such as ma-ma-ma, da-da-da. Children babble as practice in creating specific\nsounds, and by the time they are a 1 year old, the babbling uses primarily the sounds of the language that they are\nlearning (de Boysson-Bardies, Sagart, & Durand, 1984). These vocalizations have a conversational tone that sounds\nmeaningful even though it is not. Babbling also helps children understand the social, communicative function of\nlanguage. Children who are exposed to sign language babble in sign by making hand movements that represent real\nlanguage (Petitto & Marentette, 1991).\nGesturing. Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence\nthat gesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). Deaf babies also use\ngestures to communicate wants, reactions, and feelings. Because gesturing seems to be easier than vocalization for\nsome toddlers, sign language is sometimes taught to enhance an infant\u2019s ability to communicate by making use of the\nease of gesturing. The rhythm and pattern of language is used when deaf babies sign, just as it is when hearing babies\nbabble.\nUnderstanding. At around ten months of age, the infant can understand more than he or she can say, which is referred\nto as receptive language. You may have experienced this phenomenon as well if you have ever tried to learn a second\nlanguage. You may have been able to follow a conversation more easily than contribute to it. One of the first words\nthat children understand is their own name, usually by about 6 months, followed by commonly used words like \u201cbottle,\u201d\n\u201cmama,\u201d and \u201cdoggie\u201d by 10 to 12 months (Mandel, Jusczyk, & Pisoni, 1995). Infants shake their head \u201cno\u201d around 6\u20139\nmonths, and they respond to verbal requests to do things like \u201cwave bye-bye\u201d or \u201cblow a kiss\u201d around 9\u201312 months.\nChildren also use contextual information, particularly the cues that parents provide, to help them learn language.\nChildren learn that people are usually referring to things that they are looking at when they are speaking (Baldwin, 1993),\nand that that the speaker\u2019s emotional expressions are related to the content of their speech.\n120 | Language & Cognition Holophrasic speech. Children begin using their first words at about 12 or 13 months of age and may use partial words to\nconvey thoughts at even younger ages. These one-word expressions are referred to as holophrasic speech. For example,\nthe child may say \u201cju\u201d for the word \u201cjuice\u201d and use this sound when referring to a bottle. The listener must interpret\nthe meaning of the holophrase, and when this is someone who has spent time with the child, interpretation is not too\ndifficult. But someone who has not been around the child will have trouble knowing what is meant. Imagine the parent\nwho to a friend exclaims, \u201cEzra\u2019s talking all the time now!\u201d The friend hears only \u201cju ga da\u201d to which the parent explains\nmeans, \u201cI want some milk when I go with Daddy.\u201d\nLanguage Errors: The early utterances of children contain many errors, for instance, confusing /b/ and /d/, or /c/\nand /z/. The words children create are often simplified, in part because they are not yet able to make the more complex\nsounds of the real language (Dobrich & Scarborough, 1992). Children may say \u201ckeekee\u201d for kitty, \u201cnana\u201d for banana, and\n\u201cvesketti\u201d for spaghetti because it is easier. Often these early words are accompanied by gestures that may also be easier\nto produce than the words themselves. Children\u2019s pronunciations become increasingly accurate between 1 and 3 years,\nbut some problems may persist until school age.\nA child who learns that a word stands for an object may initially think that the word can be used for only that particular\nobject, which is referred to as underextension. Only the family\u2019s Irish Setter is a \u201cdoggie\u201d, for example. More often,\nhowever, a child may think that a label applies to all objects that are similar to the original object, which is called\noverextension. For example, all animals become \u201cdoggies\u201d. The first error is often the result of children learning the\nmeaning of a word in a specific context, while the second language error is a function of the child\u2019s smaller vocabulary.\nFirst words and cultural influences. If the child is using English, first words tend to be nouns. The child labels objects\nsuch as cup, ball, or other items that they regularly interact with. In a verb-friendly language such as Chinese, however,\nchildren may learn more verbs. This may also be due to the different emphasis given to objects based on culture. Chinese\nchildren may be taught to notice action and relationships between objects, while children from the United States may\nbe taught to name an object and its qualities (color, texture, size, etc.). These differences can be seen when comparing\ninterpretations of art by older students from China and the United States (Imai et al., 2008).\nTwo-word sentences and telegraphic (text message) speech. By the time they become toddlers, children have a\nvocabulary of about 50-200 words and begin putting those words together in telegraphic speech, such as \u201cbaby bye-bye\u201d\nor \u201cdoggie pretty\u201d. Words needed to convey messages are spoken, but the articles and other parts of speech necessary\nfor grammatical correctness are not yet used. These expressions sound like a telegraph, or perhaps a better analogy\ntoday would be that they read like a text message. Telegraphic speech/text message speech occurs when unnecessary\nwords are not used. \u201cGive baby ball\u201d is used rather than \u201cGive the baby the ball.\u201d\nInfant-directed speech. Why is a horse a \u201chorsie\u201d? Have you ever wondered why adults tend to use \u201cbaby talk\u201d or that\nsing-song type of intonation and exaggeration used when talking to children? This represents a universal tendency and\nis known as infant-directed speech. It involves exaggerating the vowel and consonant sounds, using a high-pitched voice,\nand delivering the phrase with great facial expression (Clark, 2009). Why is this done? Infants are frequently more attuned\nto the tone of voice of the person speaking than to the content of the words themselves and are aware of the target\nof speech. Werker, Pegg, and McLeod (1994) found that infants listened longer to a woman who was speaking to a baby\nthan to a woman who was speaking to another adult. Adults may use this form of speech in order to clearly articulate\nthe sounds of a word so that the child can hear the sounds involved. It may also be because when this type of speech is\nused, the infant pays more attention to the speaker and this sets up a pattern of interaction in which the speaker and\nlistener are in tune with one another.\nTheories of Language Development\nPsychological theories of language learning differ in terms of the importance they place on nature and nurture.\nRemember that we are a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now believe that language acquisition is\nLanguage & Cognition | 121 partially inborn and partially learned through our interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport,\n1995; Stork & Widdowson, 1974). First to be discussed are the biological theories, including nativist, brain areas and\ncritical periods. Next, learning theory and social pragmatics will be presented.\nNativism. The linguist Noam Chomsky is a believer in the\nnature approach to language, arguing that human brains\ncontain a language acquisition device (LAD) that includes a\nuniversal grammar that underlies all human language\n(Chomsky, 1965, 1972). According to this approach, each of the\nmany languages spoken around the world (there are between\n6,000 and 8,000) is an individual example of the same\nunderlying set of procedures that are hardwired into human\nbrains. Chomsky\u2019s account proposes that children are born with\na knowledge of general rules of syntax that determine how\nsentences are constructed. Language develops as long as the\nFigure 3.27. Noam Chomsky\ninfant is exposed to it. No teaching, training, or reinforcement\nis required for language to develop as proposed by Skinner.\nChomsky differentiates between the deep structure of an idea; that is, how the idea is represented in the fundamental\nuniversal grammar that is common to all languages, and the surface structure of the idea or how it is expressed in any\none language. Once we hear or express a thought in surface structure, we generally forget exactly how it happened. At\nthe end of a lecture, you will remember a lot of the deep structure (i.e., the ideas expressed by the instructor), but you\ncannot reproduce the surface structure (the exact words that the instructor used to communicate the ideas).\nAlthough there is general agreement among psychologists that babies are genetically programmed to learn language,\nthere is still debate about Chomsky\u2019s idea that there is a universal grammar that can account for all language learning.\nEvans and Levinson (2009) surveyed the world\u2019s languages and found that none of the presumed underlying features of\nthe language acquisition device were entirely universal. In their search they found languages that did not have noun or\nverb phrases, that did not have tenses (e.g., past, present, future), and even some that did not have nouns or verbs at all,\neven though a basic assumption of a universal grammar is that all languages should share these features.\nBrain areas for language. For the 90% of people who are right-handed, language is stored and controlled by the left\ncerebral cortex, although for some left-handers this pattern is reversed. These differences can easily be seen in the\nresults of neuroimaging studies that show that listening to and producing language creates greater activity in the left\nhemisphere than in the right. Broca\u2019s area, an area in front of the left hemisphere near the motor cortex, is responsible\nfor language production (Figure 3.28). This area was first localized in the 1860s by the French physician Paul Broca, who\nstudied patients with lesions to various parts of the brain. Wernicke\u2019s area, an area of the brain next to the auditory\ncortex, is responsible for language comprehension.\n122 | Language & Cognition Figure 3.28. Drawing of Brain Showing Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s Areas\nFor most people the left hemisphere is specialized for language. Broca\u2019s area, near the motor cortex, is involved in language production,\nwhereas Wernicke\u2019s area, near the auditory cortex, is specialized for language comprehension.\nIs there a critical period for learning language? Psychologists believe there\nis a critical period, a time in which learning can easily occur, for language.\nThis critical period appears to be between infancy and puberty (Lenneberg,\n1967; Penfield & Roberts, 1959), but isolating the exact timeline has been\nelusive. Children who are not exposed to language early in their lives will\nlikely never grasp the grammatical and communication nuances of language.\nCase studies, including Victor the \u201cWild Child,\u201d who was abandoned as a\nbaby in 18th century France and not discovered until he was 12, and Genie, a\nchild whose parents kept her locked away from 18 months until 13 years of\nage, are two examples of children who were deprived of language. Both\nchildren made some progress in socialization after they were rescued, but\nneither of them ever developed a working understanding of language\n(Rymer, 1993). Yet, such case studies are fraught with many confounds. How\nmuch did the years of social isolation and malnutrition contribute to their\nproblems in language development?\nA better test for the notion of critical periods for language is found in\nFigure 3.29. Victor studies of children with hearing loss. Several studies show that the earlier\nchildren are diagnosed with hearing impairment and receive treatment, the\nLanguage & Cognition | 123 better the child\u2019s long-term language development. For instance, Stika et al. (2015) reported that when children\u2019s hearing\nloss was identified during newborn screening, and subsequently addressed, the majority showed normal language\ndevelopment when later tested at 12-18 months. Fitzpatrick, Crawford, Ni, and Durieux-Smith (2011) reported that early\nlanguage intervention in children who were moderately to severely hard of hearing, demonstrated normal outcomes in\nlanguage proficiency by 4 to 5 years of age. Tomblin et al. (2015) reported that children who were fit with hearing aids\nby 6 months of age showed good levels of language development by age 2. Those whose hearing was not corrected until\nafter 18 months showed lower language performance, even in the early preschool years. However, this study did reveal\nthat those whose hearing was corrected by toddlerhood had greatly improved language skills by age 6. The research\nwith hearing impaired children reveals that this critical period for language development is not exclusive to infancy,\nand that the brain is still receptive to language development in early childhood. Fortunately, it is has become routine to\nscreen hearing in newborns, because when hearing loss is not treated early, it can delay spoken language, literacy, and\nimpact children\u2019s social skills (Moeller & Tomblin, 2015).\nLearning theory. Perhaps the most straightforward explanation of\nlanguage development is that it occurs through the principles of\nlearning, including association and reinforcement (Skinner, 1953).\nAdditionally, Bandura (1977) described the importance of observation\nand imitation of others in learning language. There must be at least\nsome truth to the idea that language is learned through\nenvironmental interactions or nurture. Children learn the language\nthat they hear spoken around them rather than some other\nlanguage. Also supporting this idea is the gradual improvement in\nlanguage skills over time. It seems that children modify their\nlanguage through imitation and reinforcement, such as parental\npraise and being understood. For example, when a two-year-old\nchild asks for juice, he might say, \u201cme juice,\u201d to which his mother\nmight respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. However, language\ncannot be entirely learned. For one, children learn words too fast for\nthem to be learned through reinforcement. Between the ages of 18\nFigure 3.30. B.F. Skinner months and 5 years, children learn up to 10 new words every day\n(Anglin, 1993). More importantly, language is more generative than it\nis imitative. Language is not a predefined set of ideas and sentences that we choose when we need them, but rather a\nsystem of rules and procedures that allows us to create an infinite number of statements, thoughts, and ideas, including\nthose that have never previously occurred. When a child says that she \u201cswimmed\u201d in the pool, for instance, she is\nshowing generativity. No adult speaker of English would ever say \u201cswimmed,\u201d yet it is easily generated from the normal\nsystem of producing language.\n124 | Language & Cognition Other evidence that refutes the idea that all language is learned through\nexperience comes from the observation that children may learn languages\nbetter than they ever hear them. Deaf children whose parents do not\ncommunicate using ASL very well nevertheless are able to learn it perfectly on\ntheir own and may even make up their own language if they need to (Goldin-\nMeadow & Mylander, 1998). A group of deaf children in a school in Nicaragua,\nwhose teachers could not sign, invented a way to communicate through made-\nup signs (Senghas, Senghas, & Pyers, 2005). The development of this new\nNicaraguan Sign Language has continued and changed as new generations of\nstudents have come to the school and started using the language. Although the\noriginal system was not a real language, it is becoming closer and closer every\nyear, showing the development of a new language in modern times.\nSocial pragmatics. Another view emphasizes the very social nature of human\nlanguage. Language from this view is not only a cognitive skill, but also a social\none. Language is a tool humans use to communicate, connect to, influence, and\ninform others. Most of all, language comes out of a need to cooperate. The\nsocial nature of language has been demonstrated by a number of studies Figure 3.31. Albert Bandura\nshowing that children use several pre-linguistic skills (such as pointing and\nother gestures) to communicate not only their own needs, but what others may need. So, a child watching her mother\nsearch for an object may point to the object to help her mother find it. Eighteen-month to 30-month-olds have been\nshown to make linguistic repairs when it is clear that another person does not understand them (Grosse, Behne,\nCarpenter & Tomasello, 2010). Grosse et al. (2010) found that even when the child was given the desired object, if there\nhad been any misunderstanding along the way (such as a delay in being handed the object, or the experimenter calling\nthe object by the wrong name), children will make linguistic repairs. This would suggest that children are using language\nnot only as a means of achieving some material goal, but also to make themselves understood in the mind of another\nperson.\nSupplemental Materials\nOptional Reading: The Brain in the First Two Years\nSome of the most dramatic physical change that occurs during this period is in the brain. We are born with\nmost of the brain cells that we will ever have; that is, about 85 billion neurons whose function is to store and\ntransmit information (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997). While most of the brain\u2019s neurons are present at\nbirth, they are not fully mature. During the next several years dendrites, or branching extensions that collect\ninformation from other neurons, will undergo a period of exuberance. Because of this proliferation of\ndendrites, by age two a single neuron might have thousands of dendrites. Synaptogenesis, or the formation\nof connections between neurons, continues from the prenatal period forming thousands of new connections\nduring infancy and toddlerhood. This period of rapid neural growth is referred to as synaptic blooming.\nThe blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a period of synaptic pruning, where neural\nLanguage & Cognition | 125 connections are reduced thereby making those that are used much stronger. It is thought that pruning causes\nthe brain to function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).\nExperience will shape which of these connections are maintained and which of these are lost. Ultimately,\nabout 40 percent of these connections will be lost (Webb, Monk, and Nelson, 2001). Blooming occurs during\nthe first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various areas of\nthe brain.\nAnother major change occurring in the central nervous system is the development of myelin, a coating of\nfatty tissues around the axon of the neuron (Carlson, 2014). Myelin helps insulate the nerve cell and speed the\nrate of transmission of impulses from one cell to another. This enhances the building of neural pathways\nand improves coordination and control of movement and thought processes. The development of myelin\ncontinues into adolescence but is most dramatic during the first several years of life.\nThe infant brain grows very fast. At birth the brain is about 250 grams (half a pound) and by one year it is\nalready 750 grams (Eliot, 1999). Comparing to adult size, the newborn brain is approximately 33% of adult\nsize at birth, and in just 90 days, it is already at 55% of adult size (Holland et al., 2014). Most of the neural\nactivity is occurring in the cortex or the thin outer covering of the brain involved in voluntary activity and\nthinking. The cortex is divided into two hemispheres, and each hemisphere is divided into four lobes, each\nseparated by folds known as fissures. If we look at the cortex starting at the front of the brain and moving\nover the top (see Figure 3.3), we see first the frontal lobe (behind the forehead), which is responsible\nprimarily for thinking, planning, memory, and judgment. Following the frontal lobe is the parietal lobe,\nwhich extends from the middle to the back of the skull and which is responsible primarily for processing\ninformation about touch. Next is the occipital lobe, at the very back of the skull, which processes visual\ninformation. Finally, in front of the occipital lobe, between the ears, is the temporal lobe, which is\nresponsible for hearing and language (Jarrett, 2015).\nAlthough the brain grows rapidly during infancy, specific brain regions do not mature at the same rate.\nPrimary motor areas develop earlier than primary sensory areas, and the prefrontal cortex, that is located\nbehind the forehead, is the least developed (Giedd, 2015). As the prefrontal cortex matures, the child is\nincreasingly able to regulate or control emotions, to plan activities, strategize, and have better judgment.\nThis is not fully accomplished in infancy and toddlerhood, but continues throughout childhood, adolescence\nand into adulthood.\nLateralization is the process in which different functions become localized primarily on one side of the brain.\nFor example, in most adults the left hemisphere is more active than the right during language production,\nwhile the reverse pattern is observed during tasks involving visuospatial abilities (Springer & Deutsch, 1993).\nThis process develops over time, however, structural asymmetries between the hemispheres have been\nreported even in fetuses (Chi, Dooling, & Gilles, 1997; Kasprian et al., 2011) and infants (Dubois et al., 2009).\nLastly, neuroplasticity refers to the brain\u2019s ability to change, both physically and chemically, to enhance its\nadaptability to environmental change and compensate for injury. The control of some specific bodily\nfunctions, such as movement, vision, and hearing, is performed in specified areas of the cortex, and if these\nareas are damaged, the individual will likely lose the ability to perform the corresponding function. The\nbrain\u2019s neurons have a remarkable capacity to reorganize and extend themselves to carry out these\nparticular functions in response to the needs of the organism, and to repair any damage. As a result, the\nbrain constantly creates new neural communication routes and rewires existing ones. Both environmental\nexperiences, such as stimulation and events within a person\u2019s body, such as hormones and genes, affect the\n126 | Language & Cognition brain\u2019s plasticity. So too does age. Adult brains demonstrate neuroplasticity, but they are influenced less\nextensively than those of infants (Kolb & Fantie, 1989; Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).\nReferences\nAmerican Optometric Association.

As children mature, parent-child relationships\nnaturally change. Preschool and grade-school children are\nmore capable, have their own preferences, and sometimes\nrefuse or seek to compromise with parental expectations. This\ncan lead to greater parent-child conflict, and how conflict is\nmanaged by parents further shapes the quality of parent-child\nrelationships.\nBaumrind (1971) identified a model of parenting that focuses on\nthe level of control/ expectations that parents have regarding\ntheir children and how warm/responsive they are. This model\nFigure 4.1\nresulted in four parenting styles. In general, children develop\ngreater competence and self-confidence when parents have\nhigh, but reasonable expectations for children\u2019s behavior, communicate well with them, are warm, loving and responsive,\nand use reasoning, rather than coercion as preferred responses to children\u2019s misbehavior. This kind of parenting style\nhas been described as authoritative (Baumrind, 2013). Authoritative parents are supportive and show interest in their\nkids\u2019 activities but are not overbearing and allow them to make constructive mistakes. Parents allow negotiation where\nappropriate, and consequently this type of parenting is considered more democratic.\nAuthoritarian is the traditional model of parenting in which parents make the rules and children are expected to be\nobedient. Baumrind suggests that authoritarian parents tend to place maturity demands on their children that are\nunreasonably high and tend to be aloof and distant. Consequently, children reared in this way may fear rather than\nrespect their parents and, because their parents do not allow discussion, may take out their frustrations on safer\ntargets-perhaps as bullies toward peers.\nPermissive parenting involves holding expectations of children that are below what could be reasonably expected from\nthem. Children are allowed to make their own rules and determine their own activities. Parents are warm and\ncommunicative but provide little structure for their children. Children fail to learn self-discipline and may feel somewhat\ninsecure because they do not know the limits.\nUninvolved parents are disengaged from their children. They do not make demands on their children and are non-\nresponsive. These children can suffer in school and in their relationships with their peers (Gecas & Self, 1991).\nKeep in mind that most parents do not follow any model completely. Real people tend to fall somewhere in between\nthese styles. Sometimes parenting styles change from one child to the next or in times when the parent has more or\nless time and energy for parenting. Parenting styles can also be affected by concerns the parent has in other areas of\nhis or her life. For example, parenting styles tend to become more authoritarian when parents are tired and perhaps\nmore authoritative when they are more energetic. Sometimes parents seem to change their parenting approach when\nothers are around, maybe because they become more self-conscious as parents or are concerned with giving others the\nimpression that they are a \u201ctough\u201d parent or an \u201ceasy-going\u201d parent. Additionally, parenting styles may reflect the type\nof parenting someone saw modeled while growing up.\nParenting | 133 Culture. The impact of culture and class cannot be ignored when examining parenting styles. The model of parenting\ndescribed above assumes that the authoritative style is the best because this style is designed to help the parent raise\na child who is independent, self-reliant and responsible. These are qualities favored in \u201cindividualistic\u201d cultures such as\nthe United States, particularly by the middle class. However, in \u201ccollectivistic\u201d cultures such as China or Korea, being\nobedient and compliant are favored behaviors. Authoritarian parenting has been used historically and reflects cultural\nneed for children to do as they are told. African-American, Hispanic, and Asian parents tend to be more authoritarian\nthan non-Hispanic whites. In societies where family members\u2019 cooperation is necessary for survival, rearing children\nwho are independent and who strive to be on their own makes no sense. However, in an economy based on being\nmobile in order to find jobs and where one\u2019s earnings are based on education, raising a child to be independent is very\nimportant.\nIn a classic study on social class and parenting styles, Kohn (1977) explains that parents tend to emphasize qualities that\nare needed for their own survival when parenting their children. Working class parents are rewarded for being obedient,\nreliable, and honest in their jobs. They are not paid to be independent or to question the management; rather, they move\nup and are considered good employees if they show up on time, do their work as they are told, and can be counted on by\ntheir employers. Consequently, these parents reward honesty and obedience in their children. Middle class parents who\nwork as professionals are rewarded for taking initiative, being self-directed, and assertive in their jobs. They are required\nto get the job done without being told exactly what to do. They are asked to be innovative and to work independently.\nThese parents encourage their children to have those qualities as well by rewarding independence and self-reliance.\nParenting styles can reflect many elements of culture.\nSpanking\nSpanking is often thought of as a rite of passage for children, and this method of discipline continues to be endorsed\nby the majority of parents (Smith, 2012). Just how effective is spanking, however, and are there negative consequences?\nAfter reviewing the research, Smith (2012) states \u201cmany studies have shown that physical punishment, including\nspanking, hitting and other means of causing pain, can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behavior, physical injury\nand mental health problems for children\u201d (p. 60). Gershoff, (2008) reviewed decades of research and recommended that\nparents and caregivers make every effort to avoid physical punishment and called for the banning of physical discipline\nin all U.S. schools.\nIn a longitudinal study that followed more than 1500 families from 20 U.S. cities, parents\u2019 reports of spanking were\nassessed at ages three and five (MacKenzie, Nicklas, Waldfogel, & Brooks-Gunn, 2013). Measures of externalizing\nbehavior and receptive vocabulary were assessed at age nine. Results indicated that those children who were spanked\nat least twice a week by their mothers scored 2.66 points higher on a measure of aggression and rule-breaking than\nthose who were never spanked. Additionally, those who were spanked less, still scored 1.17 points higher than those\nnever spanked. When fathers did the spanking, those spanked at least two times per week scored 5.7 points lower on a\nvocabulary test than those never spanked. This study revealed the negative cognitive effects of spanking in addition to\nthe increase in aggressive behavior. 146\nInternationally, physical discipline is increasingly being viewed as a violation of children\u2019s human rights. According to\nSave the Children (2019), 46 countries have banned the use of physical punishment, and the United Nations Committee\non the Rights of the Child (2014) called physical punishment \u201clegalized violence against children\u201d and advocated that\nphysical punishment be eliminated in all settings.\nMany alternatives to spanking are advocated by child development specialists and include:\n\u2022 Praising and modeling appropriate behavior\n134 | Parenting \u2022 Providing time-outs for inappropriate behavior\n\u2022 Giving choices\n\u2022 Helping the child identify emotions and learning to calm down\n\u2022 Ignoring small annoyances\n\u2022 Withdrawing privileges\nOptional further reading:\nHere is an article summarizing current research on the effects of spanking, which concludes with the\nrecommendation that \u201cparents should avoid physical punishment, psychologists should advise and advocate\nagainst it, and policymakers should develop means of educating the public about the harms of and\nalternatives to physical punishment\u201d (Gershoff et al., 2018, p. 626)\nGershoff, E. T., Goodman, G. S., Miller-Perrin, C. L., Holden, G. W., Jackson, Y., & Kazdin, A. E. (2018). The\nstrength of the causal evidence against physical punishment of children and its implications for parents,\npsychologists, and policymakers. American Psychologist, 73(5), 626-638.\nSibling Relationships\nSiblings spend a considerable amount of time with each other\nand offer a unique relationship that is not found with same-age\npeers or with adults. Siblings play an important role in the\ndevelopment of social skills. Cooperative and pretend play\ninteractions between younger and older siblings can teach\nempathy, sharing, and cooperation (Pike, Coldwell, & Dunn,\n2005), as well as, negotiation and conflict resolution\n(Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). However, the quality of sibling\nrelationships is often mediated by the quality of the parent-\nchild relationship and the psychological adjustment of the child\n(Pike et al., 2005). For instance, more negative interactions\nbetween siblings have been reported in families where parents\nhad poor patterns of communication with their children (Brody,\nFigure 4.2\nStoneman, & McCoy, 1994). Children who have emotional and\nbehavioral problems are also more likely to have negative interactions with their siblings. However, the psychological\nadjustment of the child can sometimes be a reflection of the parent-child relationship. Thus, when examining the quality\nof sibling interactions, it is often difficult to tease out the separate effect of adjustment from the effect of the parent-\nchild relationship.\nWhile parents want positive interactions between their children, conflicts are going to arise, and some confrontations\ncan be the impetus for growth in children\u2019s social and cognitive skills. The sources of conflict between siblings often\ndepend on their respective ages. Dunn and Munn (1987) revealed that over half of all sibling conflicts in early childhood\nwere disputes about property rights. By middle childhood this starts shifting toward control over social situations, such\nParenting | 135 as what games to play, disagreements about facts or opinions, or rude behavior (Howe, Rinaldi, Jennings, & Petrakos,\n2002).\nResearchers have also found that the strategies children use to deal with conflict change with age, but this is also\ntempered by the nature of the conflict. Abuhatoum and Howe (2013) found that coercive strategies (e.g., threats) were\nmore common when the dispute centered on property rights, while reasoning was more likely to be used by older\nsiblings and in disputes regarding control over the social situation. However, younger siblings also use reasoning,\nfrequently bringing up the concern of legitimacy (e.g., \u201cYou\u2019re not the boss\u201d) when in conflict with an older sibling. This\nis a very common strategy used by younger siblings and is possibly an adaptive strategy in order for younger siblings\nto assert their autonomy (Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). A number of researchers have found that children who can use\nnon-coercive strategies are more likely to have a successful resolution, whereby a compromise is reached and neither\nchild feels slighted (Ram & Ross, 2008; Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). Not surprisingly, friendly relationships with siblings\noften lead to more positive interactions with peers. The reverse is also true. A child can also learn to get along with a\nsibling, with, as the song says, \u201ca little help from my friends\u201d (Kramer & Gottman, 1992).\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 This episode of VICE takes a journey to Sweden and follows a gender non-conforming family to find out what it\u2019s\nlike to grow up without the gender binary.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

For example, research on child and adolescent development documents the\ncentral roles of parents, caregivers, and extended families. At the same time, parenting and families have social contexts\nof their own. Research on the cultural and societal forces that influence family functioning can help identify some of\nthe contextual factors that make the task of parenting easier or harder. To better understand the idea of \u201chigher-order\ncontexts of parenting,\u201d we examine two higher-order societal factors that exert a downward pressure on parenting,\nnamely, status hierarchies of class (i.e., wealth and education or socioeconomic status, SES) and race (i.e., socially-\nassigned categories based on outward appearance).\nBy status hierarchies, we mean that all societies endorse more or less explicit rank orderings of the value of different\nsubgroups of people (Ridgeway, 2014). These societal ladders, which place subgroups on higher or lower rungs, matter to\ndevelopment because rank orderings grant more or less access to opportunitiesand resources. Societies treat subgroups\nat the top and bottom of such hierarchies very differently and these inequities produce disparities in living conditions,\nhealth, and functioning. Based on entrenched myths (i.e., prejudice and stereotypes), such disparities are often used as\nevidence of the inherent superiority of subgroups at the top and the inferiority of subgroups at the bottom. If subgroups\nobject to the injustice of hazardous conditions and entrenched myths, they are handed cover stories, which insist that\npeople at the bottom have only themselves to blame for these inequities. In trying to raise their families, parents have to\ndeal with both hazardous objective living conditions, and the effects of entrenched myths and cover stories.\nThere are three major ways that status hierarchies, like those organized around class and race, make parenting harder:\n1. Inequities create objective living conditions that are developmentally hazardous to children and families;\n2. Hardships and discrimination force people to parent under stressful conditions; and\n138 | Parenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order\nContexts 3. Families must expend effort to counteract the pervasive effects of discrimination and prejudice on the\ndevelopment of their children and adolescents.\nOptional Reading: Macrosystems of Development\nIf you would to learn more about societal status hierarchies, for example, how they are created and\nenforced, and the kinds of research that document their effects, we have created an optional supplementary\nessay that delves deeper into these issues. [Macrosystems of Development (pdf)]\nDevelopmentally Hazardous Living Conditions\nStatus hierarchies based on class and race mean that, depending on where a family falls on these ladders, they are\nparenting in different worlds. Children and families at the bottom of multiple status hierarchies are particularly at\nrisk for developmentally hazardous living conditions and other inequities. The compounding of environmental risk\nis especially troubling because racial/ethnic minority children are up to three times more likely than their white\ncounterparts to be living in families with incomes below the poverty line. For example, according to the US Census\nBureau, in 2018, of all the white children in this country under the age of 6, 9.1% lived in families with incomes at or below\nthe poverty line; of Asian-American children, 11.2%. However, among Latinx children, more than twice as many, 24.3%,\nlived in poverty, and for Black children, more than three times, or 32.4%; this rate is probably similar for Indigenous\nchildren.\nPoverty and racism create objectively different living conditions for children and youth. As summarized in the required\nreadings (Evans, 2004; Trent, Dooley, & Doug\u00e9, 2019), inequities start with differential access to the basics of life: healthy\nfood, secure housing, and health care. Poor children are exposed to more violence, instability, chaos, turmoil, and\nfamily separation. Neighborhoods with higher concentrations of poverty are more dangerous, offer fewer municipal\nservices, suffer greater physical deterioration, and contain fewer amenities (e.g., community centers, playgrounds,\nparks). Schools and daycare are of lower quality. Disparities by class and race are found in opportunities for higher\neducation, employment, and economic advancement. There are even differences in the quality of the air children\nbreathe and the water they drink (Taylor, 2014). Such disparities are so significant that they register in differential\nphysical health and mortality rates for children from different racial/ethnic groups and levels of SES (e.g., Council\non Community Pediatrics, 2016). All of these objective disparities make the job of caring for a family more difficult.\nResearchers have concluded that it is not any one factor, but the accumulation of multiple environmental risks that make\nthese living conditions so risky (e.g., Evans, Li, & Whipple, 2013).\nThe developmentally hazardous conditions in which many poor and minority children grow up can be thought of as\nsocietally sanctioned. By this we mean that our society has decided that children only get as much of the basics needed\nfor their healthy development as their families can afford. Outside the US, many societies have decided that all children\nshould breathe clean air and drink clean water, by enforcing statutes that make pollution illegal and thereby preventing\nconcentrations of pollution in neighborhoods with high concentrations of poverty. Or they legislate mixed-income\nhousing, so there are no neighborhoods with concentrations of poverty. Or they decide that everyone should have\naccess to healthy food, secure housing, and affordable health care. Some societies invest in the infrastructure and safety\nof all communities, so that low wealth neighborhoods still have community centers, farmer\u2019s markets, and parks. Or they\nfully fund all schools and provide free access to a high-quality college education. In some societies, there is a threshold\nbelow which the living conditions of children and families are not allowed to fall. All families have the right to these\nParenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order Contexts | 139 developmental basics. In these societies, the disparities in living conditions between the richest and poorest children are\nnot as stark, and conditions for the poorest children are not developmentally dangerous.\nREQUIREDReading: Integration of research on the effects of childhood poverty\nEvans, G. (2004). The environment of childhood poverty. American Psychologist, 59, 77-92.\nThis short paper by Gary Evans (Evans, 2004) is a required reading for human development because it\nsummarizes the developmentally hazardous conditions experienced by children at the bottom of the SES\nhierarchy. This report is especially sobering because the poorest subgroup in the US is made up of children\u2013\nchildren under the age of 6 to be exact (National Center for Children in Poverty, 2018). It can be\ndiscouraging to read about the long list of risky conditions that poor children face, but this information is a\ncrucial step toward deciding as a society the kinds of living conditions in which we want our children to\ngrow up.\nAlthough this paper was written in 2004, the conditions it describes continue to be true TODAY.\nREQUIRED Reading: Integration of research on the effects of racism on child and adolescent health and\ndevelopment\nTrent, M., Dooley, D. G., & Doug\u00e9, J. (2019). The impact of racism on child and adolescent\nhealth. Pediatrics, 144(2), e20191765.\nThis short paper, commissioned by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), is a required reading for this\nclass because it provides an overview of research on the harmful effects of racism on child and adolescent\nhealth and development. It ends with a series of recommendations for ways in which pediatricians and AAP\ncan help to protect children and adolescents from these effects, and at the same time transform pediatric\ntraining and practice to work toward more just and equitable healthcare systems.\nTip for class projects. The recommendations at the end of this paper provide a good example of how\ndevelopmental contexts can be improved, and may inspire you and your group as you work on plans to\nreimagine and reinvent your target developmental contexts.\nParenting Under Stress\nA second way that status hierarchies exert a downward pressure on children and families is that people are forced to\ndo their caregiving under very stressful conditions. The objective hardships, discrimination, and prejudice some families\nface create an unsupportive context for the important job of parenting and providing for a family, which are challenging\ntasks even under the best of circumstances. Most parents and families rise to these challenges, but few people parent\ntheir best under such adversity.\nWhen studying parents and families, and especially when examining parenting practices that seem problematic, it\nis essential to view them in context. Some practices, for example, extremely strict parenting, are connected with\nauthoritarian styles (a combination of high demands for obedience with low warmth and affection) and undesirable\noutcomes in white middle class children and youth. In other racial/ethnic groups, however, extremely strict parenting\n140 | Parenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order Contexts is often accompanied by high parental warmth and affection (creating a parenting style not yet captured in standard\ntypologies that might be called \u201cprotective\u201d). Children and adolescents may see their parents as demanding but fair,\ntheir behavior grounded in love and genuine concern for their welfare. For example, an indigenous practice endorsed by\nnative and immigrant Chinese parents called \u201ctraining\u201d is rooted in Confucian tradition and emphasizes strict parental\ncontrol and guidance of children\u2019s behaviors through parental devotion, involvement, and monitoring (Chao, 2000). In\nthese cases, \u201charsh\u201d parenting may have different consequences. As well as different antecedents\u2013 within communities\nof color and immigrant communities, parents may prioritize keeping children safe under dangerous conditions where\ndisobedience can have serious consequences.\nAll children need and deserve high quality parenting, and are not to blame if their parents and families are not able to\nmeet their needs. An idea relevant to everyone, but especially important to students whose families are at the bottom\nof multiple status hierarchies, is the concept of \u201cinter-generational trauma\u201d [pdf]. This notion is especially useful for\nconceptualizing the ways that histories of discrimination and prejudice, as seen in the childhoods and lives of their\nparents and grandparents, can help students understand some of the ways that unresolved post-traumatic stress may\nhave shaped their families while they were growing up. During the period of emerging adulthood, young people begin\nto be able to see their parents as whole people, operating within powerful histories and societal forces not of their\nown making. We try to help students understand that at every rung in our status hierarchies all parents at times\nshow behaviors that are self-centered, neglectful, inconsistent, or unfair. And that parents who are sometimes harsh or\nrejecting, are also sometimes loving, caring, warm, and affectionate. All parents make mistakes, and most recognize and\nregret any harm they have done to their children. Like everyone else, parents are growing and developing.\nOver time, many students come to appreciate and admire what their parents have been able to accomplish, and respect\ntheir protective efforts and the lessons they tried to teach, while also acknowledging the work we all still have to do\non unresolved issues left over from our childhood experiences. Students are reassured by research showing that most\npeople, even those who experience extreme adversity as children, are resilient, able to recover and heal, and go on to\nlead productive adult lives and provide excellent parenting for their own children. Many people report that some of the\nmost theraputic activities involve beginning to create families of their own that provide children and youth (whether\nbiological, adopted, foster, nieces, nephews, or neighborhood children) stable and loving childhood experiences.\nCounteracting Prejudice and Discrimination\nA third way that status hierarchies make parenting harder is that parents must work to protect their offspring from\nthe effects of entrenched myths societies hold about subgroups on the lower rungs. Families must teach children and\nadolescents how to cope constructively with prejudice and discrimination (e.g., Jones et al., 2020).\nFor example, research on implicit bias suggests that societal prejudices about race and class are widespread. Now think\nof all the people with whom children and youth interact in the settings of their everyday lives: At school (classmates,\npeers, teachers, guidance counselors), in the neighborhood (friends, neighbors, shopkeepers, medical professionals,\nsocial workers, police officers, prosecutors, judges), and eventually at universities and work. We can keep on going up\nthe levels of the macrosystem, considering social media, politics, science, and so on. Parents are right to worry about\nwhat happens when their offspring spend much of their lives being taught, guided, judged, and hired by people who\nunconsciously regard them as \u201cless than.\u201d Parents spend a great deal of time and energy working with these systems to\nmake sure that their children and youth are treated fairly.\nOne of the most eye-opening effects of status hierarchies is that children are introduced to the core idea underlying\nthem, namely, that some subgroups of people are of greater value than others. Few endorse this idea in the abstract.\nMost people would never say that boys are worth more than girls, or people with a lot of money are better than people\nwithout, or white people are more valuable than people of color. But we have to come to grips with the fact that, whether\nwe admit it or not, status hierarchies clearly communicate these messages to children (e.g., Ruck, Mistry, & Flanagan,\n2019).\nParenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order Contexts | 141 Since categories are socially constructed, children first have to be taught to recognize them. They slowly learn, for\nexample, that this society makes a big deal of the characteristics we call \u201crace\u201d and the qualities we assign to \u201cmoney.\u201d\nThen, as children directly experience and observe the ways that people are treated differently based on category\nmembership, they begin to understand what it means to belong to different ranks on that category. Finally, as children\ncome to see where they themselves fall on those rankings, for example, on subgroups we call \u201crace,\u201d we can say that\nchildren have been \u201cracialized.\u201d They see themselves and their identity in terms of those categories and the values they\nhave been assigned. They are introduced to the societal idea of hierarchies of human value, and they are shown where\nthey belong on these different hierarchies.\nResearch shows that, to counteract these potentially harmful influences, poor and minority families draw on a variety of\nstrengths and assets, including proficiencies and protective factors not typically found in the repertoire of white middle\nclass families, such as processes through which families constructively deal with ongoing racial/ethnic discrimination\n(e.g., Gaylord\u2010Harden, Burrow, & Cunningham, 2012). Chief among these assets are supportive extended family\nnetworks, close-knit communities, cultural traditions and practices, familial racial/ethnic socialization, and social\nactivism.\nFamilies prioritize and cherish their children and youth, and together, these community strengths contribute to the\ndevelopment of positive racial/ethnic identities, instill cultural pride, teach adaptive ways of coping with adversity, and\nmodel civic participation in movements for social justice.\nREQUIRED Video: The Story We Tell about Poor People Isn\u2019t True\nTo continue the process of reworking entrenched myths, we ask students to watch this short video by Mia\nBirdsong, who focuses her TED talk on the true story of the creativity, resourcefulness, grit, and\ndetermination shown by poor people. Her goal is to change attitudes of decision-makers so that policies\nand practices can more equitably support poor people in finding ways to generate income while supporting\ntheir communities.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

To give youth a strong sense of tribal heritage, identity, and belonging, programs are\nanchored in relational native worldviews and include activities like elders\u2019 instruction in tribal history,\nstorytelling, drumming, singing, language, traditional art and craftwork, sacred ceremonies, outdoor\nactivities, cultural events, and social justice projects. From this perspective, deep connections to culture and\nheritage are prevention, meaning that engaging AI \u2044AN youth in cultural practices and reinforcing\ntraditional Native worldviews serve to bolster positive development.\nKenyon, D. B., & Hanson, J. D. (2012). Incorporating traditional culture into positive youth development\nprograms with American Indian/Alaska Native youth. Child Development Perspectives, 6(3), 272-279.\nCritiques and Next Steps in the Study of Higher-order Contexts of Parenting\nOver the last several decades mainstream developmental science has been actively criticized for its approach to\nstudying the development of poor and minority children, youth, and families (e.g., Coll et al., 1996; Spencer, 1990). Three\nsets of serious critiques have been leveled.\nInclusive Models of Higher-order Contexts\nFirst, developmental models of higher-order contexts rarely included the dominant social hierarchies created by race/\nethnicity and class (and gender, sexual orientation, etc.). These societal conditions create troubling realities involving\nprejudice and discrimination that children and adolescents encounter on a daily basis, and without them, it is impossible\nto construct a full account of the causal forces shaping their development. These same factors also affect children\nfrom dominant groups, who in many ways are the beneficiaries of systems that advantage the subgroups to which\nthey belong. Yet up until recently these forces seemed to be largely invisible to mainstream researchers, who are\noverwhelmingly white and middle class.\nMore inclusive contextual models incorporate these realities, for example, the phenomenological variant of ecological\nsystems theory (PVEST; Spencer, 2006; Spencer, Dupree, & Hartmann, 1997) [pdf], and the integrative model for the\nstudy of developmental competencies in minority children (Coll et al., 1996). Drawing on social stratification theory and\nother sociological approaches, they highlight the role of positionality or intersectionality (an individual\u2019s, family\u2019s, or\nsubgroup\u2019s location in a particular societal context on the multiple status hierarchies of race, class, gender, and so\non; Crenshaw, 1989, 1991) in determining access to power, resources, and opportunities, and in shaping identities and\ncorresponding biases and viewpoints. These more complex conceptualizations of higher-order contexts enrich our\nunderstanding of the development of all children and families.\nCultural Wealth of Poor and Minority Children, Youth, and Families\nSecond, mainstream researchers have been taken to task for bringing a predominantly deficit lens (Valencia & Sol\u00f3rzano,\n1997) to the study of the development of poor and minority children and families. Researchers largely focused on\nthe problems these subgroups experience, describing children and youth as \u201cat-risk\u201d and \u201cvulnerable.\u201d Moreover,\nresearchers often argued (typically without evidence) that the disparities they found in children\u2019s outcomes were\ndue to problems stemming from children themselves or from their parents, families, or cultures, labeling them as\n\u201cdisadvantaged.\u201d Researchers seemed to forget that the majority of poor and minority children develop along adaptive\nand healthy pathways, and to overlook the strengths and assets of their families and communities.\nIn response to these deficit assumptions, there has been a push to study the positive development of minority children\nand youth (e.g., Cabrera, 2013; Cabrera, Beeghly, & Eisenberg, 2012). This approach, as seen in the recent publication of\nthe first Handbook on Positive Development of Minority Children and Youth (Cabrera & Leyendecker, 2017), highlights a\nParenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order Contexts | 143 strength-based view that focuses on positive adaptation, competence, and resilience and the factors that enable such\nhealthy development. As feminists pointed out in the study of girls, growing up female and raising female children within\nhigher-order systems that label and treat girls differently even before they are born is a challenging task (Robnett,\nDaniels, & Leaper, 2018). One way researchers can help is by assuming that girls\u2019 families and communities are finding\nmultiple creative and courageous ways to support their girls and young women so they grow up into strong and resilient\npeople, whole and magnificent, who will be ready to do their parts to change these discriminatory societal conditions\nand narratives. Poor and minority children and families deserve the same clarity of understanding.\nTo counteract deficit assumptions, the last few decades have seen an outpouring of research documenting the cultural\nwealth of historically marginalized communities (e.g., Yosso, 2005 [pdf]). Some of the most interesting research on\nchildren and families today lifts up and learns from the cultural resources created and preserved by Black, Native, Latinx,\nAsian-American, immigrant, deaf, and LGBTQ+ communities, as well as countless others. Their cultural knowledge\nand wisdom enable them to prepare children not only to negotiate the developmental tasks faced by all children\nand youth, but also to deal with obstacles that families higher on the status hierarchy do not have to face, such as\ncoping constructively with ongoing inequities and entrenched myths. Communities also have a wealth of knowledge and\nexperience in resisting oppression and fighting for social justice, valuable expertise that is often lacking in mainstream\nfamilies. Minority, immigrant, and poor communities have much to offer children and youth, and also the larger\nsociety of which they have always been an integral part and to which they have always made crucial, although often\nunacknowledged, contributions.\nFuture Directions\nDevelopmentalists who study the effects of higher-order contexts on the functioning of children and families must be\nvery thoughtful. On the one hand, they want to catalog as accurately and clearly as they can the human costs of growing\nup and trying to raise children in developmentally dangerous conditions. They hope that the pervasive inequities they\ndocument can be used as a basis for supporting collective efforts at societal change. On the other hand, they do not\nwant to be cogs in the societal machine that reinforces entrenched prejudices and stereotypes. They do not want their\nresearch to be used to imply that children and families are \u201cless than\u201d in any way. On the third hand, researchers cannot\nlet the positive development of most poor and minority children and the cultural and family strengths of racial/ethnic\nand low wealth communities be used as an excuse not to tackle the status hierarchies that produce poverty and racism\nhead on (Brown, Mistry, & Yip, 2019; Killen, Rutland, & Yip, 2016).\nResearch as a Call to Action\nResearch on widespread inequities and their effects on children and families motivate researchers to participate in\ncollective action to right these injustices. There are severalstrategies societies can use.\n\u2022 We can de-couple families\u2019 positions on status hierarchies from access to the basic conditions their children need\nfor healthy development. For example, we can ensure that all neighborhoods are safe, and include affordable\nhousing and access to healthy food.\n\u2022 For hierarchies like class, we can work to get rid of such big disparities between the rungs, by prioritizing actions\nthat reduce income inequality. For example, we can increase the minimum wage to a living wage, focus on job\ncreation and training, and increase opportunities for meaningful employment. Key to both these strategies is\naccess to free high-quality education from cradle to college graduation, because educational achievement is the\nmost effective way to move up societal ladders.\n\u2022 The most important strategy, of course, is to reinvent higher-order contexts themselves by surfacing and\ndemolishingsocietal hierarchies of human worth. From this perspective the two strategies described above are first\nsteps toward this ultimate goal. Researchers who favor this strategy actively critique other interventions that focus\non \u201cfixing\u201d individuals (e.g., children or their parents) and then plonking them back into hazardous developmental\n144 | Parenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order Contexts conditions. Researchers argue that strategies focused on transforming higher-order contexts are both more\nequitable and more effective, so in the end, they are much less expensive\u2013 in terms of both monetary and human\ncosts.\nPoor People\u2019s Campaign: A Call for Basic Human Rights\nIf you are interested in learning more about grassroots political movements aimed at lifting people out of\npoverty and providing basic necessities for everyone, a great place to start is with the website for the Poor\nPeople\u2019s Campaign. https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/\nTake Home Messages about Higher-Order Contexts of Parenting\nWe emphasize four big ideas from this reading:\n1. Poverty and racism create objectively different living conditions for children and youth. Caregivers and families at\nthe bottom of hierarchies (especially at the bottom of multiple hierarchies) face unnecessary hardships in the\nobjective living conditions under which they are forced to raise their children. Using Bronfenbrenner\u2019s ecological\nterms, the effects of poverty and racism pervade all the microsystems that shape the development of children and\nyouth (homes, schools, neighborhood, social work, juvenile justice system, etc.).\n2. The objective hardships, discrimination, and prejudice some families face create an unsupportive context for the\nimportant tasks of parenting and providing for a family, which are challenging even in the best of circumstances.\nMost parents and families rise to these challenges, but few people parent their best under such hardships and\nstresses. The notion of \u201cinter-generational trauma\u201d may be useful for conceptualizing how histories of\ndiscrimination and prejudice, as seen in the childhoods and lives of parents and grandparents, can help to explain\nsome of the ways that unresolved post-traumatic stress shapes families and parenting.\n3. Through their strength and resilience, minority and low wealth communities protect and support children and\nyouth, and help them build developmental competencies. Among these cultural assets are supportive extended\nfamily networks, close-knit communities, cultural traditions and practices, familial racial/ethnic socialization, and\nsocial activism. Families prioritize and cherish their children and youth, and contribute to the development of\npositive racial/ethnic identities, instill cultural pride, teach adaptive ways of coping with adversity, and model civic\nparticipation in social justice movements.\n4. Over the last several decades developmentalists have more fully incorporated the roles of status hierarchies into\ntheir models of lifespan development, replacing deficit lenses with more accurate understandings of the positive\ndevelopment of minority children and youth, and their supportive extended families, communities, and cultures.\nBecause of the hazardous developmental conditions status hierarchies create, many developmentalists are\nworking on a transformation agenda, to reinvent societal systems so they can be more supportive of all children,\nyouth, and families.\nParenting and Families: Creating Supportive Higher Order Contexts | 145 References\nBrown, C.

In 1960, 92% of children resided with married parents, while\nonly 5% had parents who were divorced or separated and 1% resided with parents who had never been married. By\n2008, 70% of children resided with married parents, 15% had parent who were divorced or separated, and 14% resided\nwith parents who had never married (Pew Research Center, 2010). In 2017, only 65% of children lived with two married\nparents, while 32% (24 million children younger than 18) lived with an unmarried parent (Livingston, 2018). Some 3% of\nchildren were not living with any parents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data.\nMost children in unmarried parent households in 2017 were living with a solo mother (21%), but a growing share were\nliving with cohabiting parents (7%) or a sole father (4%) (see Figure 4.3). The increase in children living with solo or\ncohabiting parents is thought to be due to overall declines in marriage, combined with increases in divorce. Of concern\nis that children who live with a single parent are also more likely to be living in reduced socioeconomic circumstances.\nSpecifically, while only 8% of married couples live below the poverty line, 30% of solo mothers, 17% of solo fathers, and\n16% of families with a cohabitating couple live in poverty (Livingston, 2018).\nFigure 4.3\nDivorce and its effects on children. Research suggests that divorce typically is difficult for children. For example,\nWeaver and Schofield (2015) selected a subsample of families from the National Institute of Child Health and Human\nDevelopment (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, and found that children from divorced families\nhad significantly more behavior problems than those from a matched sample of children from non-divorced families.\nThese problems were evident immediately after the separation and also in early and middle adolescence. An analysis\nof the factors that make adjustment to divorce easier or harder indicated that children exhibited more externalizing\nbehaviors if the family had fewer financial resources before the separation. Researchers suggested that perhaps a lower\nincome and lack of educational and community resources contributed to the stress involved in the divorce. Additional\nfactors predicting fewer behavior problems included a post-divorce home that was more supportive and stimulating,\nand a mother who was more sensitive and less depressed.\nCertain losses are inevitable in a divorce. Children miss the parent they no longer see as frequently, as well as any\nother family members who become estranged because of the divorce. Children may grieve the loss of the family as a\nDivorce | 149 unit, and reminisce about \u201cthe good old days\u201d when the whole family lived together. The process of divorce is typically\naccompanied by change, disruption, and confusion, as well as increased family conflict. Because they are themselves\ndealing with the divorce, parents are typically stressed out and fewer resources are available for parenting.\nVery often, divorce also means a change in the amount of money coming into the household. Custodial mothers\nexperience a 25% to 50% drop in their family income, and even five years after the divorce they have reached only 94%\nof their pre-divorce family income (Anderson, 2018). As a result, children experience new constraints on spending or\nentertainment. School-aged children, especially, may notice that they can no longer have toys, clothing or other items\nto which they have grown accustomed. Or it may mean that there is less eating out or participation in recreational\nactivities. The custodial parent may experience stress at not being able to rely on child support payments or having the\nsame level of income as before. This can affect decisions regarding healthcare, vacations, rents, mortgages and other\nexpenditures, and the stress can result in less happiness and relaxation in the home. The parent who has to take on\nmore work may also be less available to the children. Children may also have to adjust to other changes accompanying\na divorce. The divorce might mean moving to a new home and changing schools or friends. It might mean leaving a\nneighborhood that has meant a lot to them as well.\nShort-term consequences. The initial consequences of divorce can be relatively serious for children. They often express\nanger and other indicators of distress and, and show increased problems in major areas of functioning: more unruly\nand demanding behavior at home, poorer school performance, and more difficulty with peers. Children may also lose\nsome of their confidence, trust, and security in relationships. About twice as many children show serve problems\nfollowing divorce (20-25%), compared to a normative base rate of about 10%. Difficulties typically peak at about one\nyear, leading some researchers to conclude that, in terms of familial problems, the consequences of divorce are second\nonly to parental death. However, not all children of divorce suffer negative consequences (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002).\nChildren may be given more opportunity to discover their own abilities and gain independence that fosters self-esteem.\nIf divorce means a reduction in family conflict, children may feel relief. Furstenberg and Cherlin (1991) believe that the\nprimary factor influencing the way that children adjust to divorce is the way the custodial parent adjusts. If that parent\nis adjusting well, children will benefit. This may explain a good deal of the variation we find in children of divorce.\nChild characteristics. Certain characteristics of the child can also make post-divorce adjustment easier or harder.\nSpecifically, children with an easygoing temperament, who problem-solve well, and seek social support manage better\nafter divorce. Children who have a difficult temperament may experience more difficulties. Boys typically display more\novert problems than girls, and may increasingly act out during the transition. A further protective factor for children is\nintelligence (Weaver & Schofield, 2015). Children with higher IQ scores appear to be buffered from the effects of divorce.\nChildren\u2019s ability to deal with a divorce may also depend on their age. Infants and preschool-age children may suffer the\nheaviest impact from the loss of routine that the marriage offered (Temke 2006). Younger children often take divorce\nharder because they blame themselves; and can break their parent hearts a little if they promise to be good if only their\nparents will get back together again. Research has found that divorce may be most difficult for school-aged children,\nas they are old enough to understand the separation but not old enough to understand the reasoning behind it. Older\nteenagers are more likely to recognize the conflict that led to the divorce but may still feel fear, loneliness, guilt, and\npressure to choose sides. Older children often turn to peers and their families to escape from their home situation.\nLong-term consequences. Although children show much recovery following divorce, small effects persist. Compared to\nchildren from never-divorced families, children of divorce show lower levels of achievement in school, self-esteem, and\nsocial competence, as well as slightly elevated levels of emotional and behavioral problems (boys show externalizing and\ngirls internalizing behavior). During adolescence, children of divorce also have slightly higher rates sexual activity and\npregnancy, are less likely to graduate from high school, and more troubled romantic relationships.\nTo some extent, the relationships of adult children of divorce have also been found to be more problematic than those of\nadults from intact homes. For 25 years, Hetherington and Kelly (2002) followed a large sample of children of divorce and\nthose whose parents stayed together. The results indicated that 25% of adults whose parents had divorced experienced\n150 | Divorce social, emotional, or psychological problems compared with only 10% of those whose parents remained married. For\nexample, children of divorce have more difficulty forming and sustaining intimate relationships as young adults, are\nmore dissatisfied with their marriages, and consequently more likely to get divorced themselves (Arkowitz & Lilienfeld,\n2013). One of the most commonly cited long-term effects of divorce is that children of divorce may have lower levels of\neducation and occupational status (Richter & Lemola, 2017). This may be a consequence of lower income and resources\nfor funding education rather than to divorce per se. In those households where economic hardship does not occur, there\nmay be no impact on long-term economic status (Drexler, 2005).\nHelping children adjust to divorce. According to Arkowitz and Lilienfeld (2013), long-term harm from parental divorce\nis not inevitable, however, and children can navigate the experience successfully. A variety of factors can positively\ncontribute to the child\u2019s adjustment. For example, children manage better when parents limit conflict, and provide\nwarmth, emotional support and appropriate discipline. Further, children cope better when they reside with a well-\nfunctioning parent and have access to social support from peers and other adults. Those at a higher socioeconomic\nstatus may fare better because some of the negative consequences of divorce are a result of financial hardship rather\nthan divorce per se (Anderson, 2014; Drexler, 2005). It is important when considering the research findings on the\nconsequences of divorce for children to consider all the factors that can influence the outcome, as some of the negative\nconsequences associated with divorce are due to preexisting problems (Anderson, 2014). Although they may experience\nmore problems than children from non-divorced families, most children of divorce lead happy, well-adjusted lives and\ndevelop strong, positive relationships with their custodial parent (Seccombe & Warner, 2004).\nIn a study of college-age respondents, Arditti (1999) found that increasing closeness and a movement toward more\ndemocratic parenting styles were experienced following divorce. Children from single-parent families also talk to their\nmothers more often than children of two-parent families (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). Others have also found that\nrelationships between mothers and children become closer and stronger (Guttman, 1993) and suggest that greater\nequality and less rigid parenting is beneficial after divorce (Stewart, Copeland, Chester, Malley, & Barenbaum, 1997).\nFor more information on how to help children adjust, here is guide from the American Academy of\nPediatrics on Helping Children and Families Deal with Divorce.\nFor advice to parents, here is a set of informal recommendations.\nIs cohabitation and remarriage more difficult than divorce for children? The remarriage of a parent may be a more\ndifficult adjustment for a child than the divorce of a parent (Seccombe & Warner, 2004). Parents and children typically\nhave different ideas about how the stepparent should behave. Parents and stepparents are more likely to see the\nstepparent\u2019s role as that of parent. A more democratic style of parenting may become more authoritarian after a parent\nremarries. Biological parents are more likely to continue to be involved with their children jointly when neither parent\nhas remarried. They are least likely to jointly be involved if the father has remarried and the mother has not. Cohabitation\ncan be difficult for children to adjust to because cohabiting relationships in the United States tend to be short-lived.\nAbout 50 percent last less than 2 years (Brown, 2000). A child who starts a relationship with the parent\u2019s live-in partner\nmay have to sever this relationship later. Even in long-term cohabiting relationships, once it is over, continued contact\nwith the child is rare.\nDivorce | 151 Blended families. One in six children (16%) live in a\nblended family (Pew Research Center, 2015). As can be\nseen in Figure 4.5, Hispanic, black and white children are\nequally likely to be living in blended families. In contrast,\nchildren of Asian descent are more likely to be living with\ntwo married parents, often in their first marriage. Blended\nfamilies are not new. In the 1700-1800s there were many\nblended families, but they were created because one\nparent (usually the mother) died and the other parent\nremarried. Most blended families today are a result of\ndivorce and remarriage, and such origins lead to new\nconsiderations. Blended families are different from intact\nfamilies and more complex in a number of ways that can\nFigure 4.4. Blended Family\npose unique challenges to those who seek to form\nsuccessful blended family relationships (Visher & Visher, 1985). Children may be a part of two households, and if each\nhas different rules, the situation can be confusing.\nMembers in blended families may not be as sure that others care and may require\nmore demonstrations of affection for reassurance. For example, stepparents\nexpect more gratitude and acknowledgment from the stepchild than they would\nwith a biological child. Stepchildren experience more uncertainty/insecurity in\ntheir relationship with the parent and fear the parents will see them as sources\nof tension. Stepparents may feel guilty for a lack of feelings they may initially\nhave toward their partner\u2019s children. Children who are required to respond to\nthe parent\u2019s new mate as though they were the child\u2019s \u201creal\u201d parent often react\nwith hostility, rebellion, or withdrawal. This occurs especially if there has not\nbeen sufficient time for the relationship to develop organically.\nFigure 4.5\nReferences\nAnderson, J. (2018).

Following the historical trends of their day, developmentalists\ninvestigated the impact of maternal separation due to war, hospitalization, and death; the effects of institutional care;\nand the multiple risks experienced by children living in poverty (e.g., Evans, 2004). As certain topics lost their taboo and\nmoved into the mainstream, researchers focused more closely on problems that can interfere with family functioning,\nlike divorce, maternal depression and other forms of mental illness, familial substance abuse, intimate partner violence,\nincarceration, and child neglect and maltreatment. Adverse experiences rooted in family functioning are especially\nproblematic for children because they not only create stressful experiences, but they can also disrupt the primary\nsystems (i.e., parenting and family) that are supposed to protect and buffer children from major stressors.\nAdversity and resilience. To make sense of research on the developmental consequences of divorce, maltreatment,\nand other adverse childhood experiences (several of which are covered later in this reading and in class), we rely on\na framework organized around the twin concepts of adversity and resilience. The notion of adversity highlights the\ngenuine impact of early traumatic childhood experiences. Such clarity can be useful to people who experienced such\nevents as children, helping them make sense of the way past events may be continuing to vibrate in their bodies and\nminds. For example, research documenting common neurophysiological effects of adverse experiences is useful to\nsurvivors because it can alert them to some of the behavioral and emotional outcomes they may already be experiencing\n(e.g., increased stress reactivity, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, vulnerability to substance abuse). It verifies that\nwhat happened to them is real and serious, but not their fault. These are side-effects of their early life experiences and\nnot evidence of character defects or lack of self-control.\nThe notion of resilience is complementary to adversity, and focuses on the strength and buoyancy of developmental\nsystems in the face of extreme stress. In order to motivate widespread efforts to eliminate adverse childhood\nexperiences, researchers and practitioners rightly underscore the severity of their harmful effects on child\ndevelopment. Such messages, however, can inadvertently communicate to adults whose childhoods included these\nexperiences, especially those exposed to multiple adverse experiences, that they should be pessimistic about their own\ndevelopmental prospects. Nothing could be further from the truth. Research documents enormous capacity for healing\nand recovery at every age. In other words, frameworks that focus only on harms of adverse experiences often make\ntheir effects seem toxic and inevitable, while underplaying the hardiness and resilience of developmental systems even\nin the face of serious adversity. Most useful are frameworks that consider both adversity and resilience as two sides of\nthe same coin.\nIn the following sections, we present research on child abuse (also called maltreatment), then describe and critique a\nperspective on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that is currently popular for both research and practice, and finish\nby exploring some of the processes of resilience that are shown by individuals and their communities.\nChild Maltreatment\nThe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act defines Child Abuse and Neglect as: Any recent act or failure to act on the\npart of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an\nact or failure to act, which presents an imminent risk of serious harm (United States Department of Health and Human\nServices, 2020). Each state has its own definition of child abuse based on the federal law, and most states recognize four\nMaltreatment, Adversity, and Resilience | 155 major types of maltreatment: neglect, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, and sexual abuse. Each of the forms\nof child maltreatment may be identified alone, but they can occur in combination.\nPrevalence of Child Abuse. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (2019),\nduring 2017 (the most recent year data has been collected) Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies received an\nestimated 4.1 million referrals for abuse involving approximately 7.5 million children. This is a rate of 31.8 per 1,000\nchildren in the national population. Professionals made 65.7% of alleged child abuse and neglect reports, and they\nincluded law enforcement (18.3%), educational (19.4%) and social services personnel (11.7%). Nonprofessionals, such as\nfriends, neighbors, and relatives, submitted 17.3% of the reports. Approximately 3.5 million children were the subjects of\nat least one report.\nWhat should you do if someone reports abuse to you? This presentation from one of our former instructors\nhas some suggestions. [pdf]\nChild abuse comes in several forms. By far the most common is neglect (78%; United States Department of Health\nand Human Services, 2013), followed by physical abuse (18%), sexual abuse (9 percent), psychological maltreatment\n(8.5%), and medical neglect (2.3%). Some children suffer from a combination of these forms of abuse. The majority\nof perpetrators are parents (80.3%) or other relatives (6.1%). The majority of victims consisted of three ethnicities:\nWhite (44.6%), Hispanic (22.3%), and African-American (20.7%). Children in their first year of life had the highest rate of\nvictimization (25.3 per 1,000 children of the same age). In 2017 an estimated 1,720 children died from abuse and neglect,\nand 71.8% of all child fatalities were younger than 3 years old. Boys had a higher child fatality rate (2.68 per 100,000\nboys), while girls died of abuse and neglect at a rate of 2.02 per 100,000 girls. More than 88% of child fatalities were\ncomprised of White (41.9%), African-American (31.5%), and Hispanic (15.1%) victims (United States Department of Health\nand Human Services, 2019).\nFor more information on the most common form of maltreatment, namely neglect, you can click here to\nlook at this report from Harvard\u2019s Center on the Developing Child.\nSexual abuse. Childhood sexual abuse is defined as any sexual contact between a child and an adult or a much older child.\nIncest refers to sexual contact between a child and family members. In each of these cases, the child is exploited by an\nolder person without regard for the child\u2019s developmental immaturity and inability to understand the sexual behavior\n(Steele, 1986). Research estimates that 1 out of 4 girls and 1 out of 10 boys have been sexually abused (Valente, 2005). The\nmedian age for sexual abuse is 8 or 9 years for both boys and girls (Finkelhorn, Hotaling, Lewis, & Smith, 1990). Most\nboys and girls are sexually abused by a male. Although rates of sexual abuse are higher for girls than for boys, boys may\nbe less likely to report abuse because of the cultural expectation that boys should be able to take care of themselves and\nbecause of the stigma attached to homosexual encounters (Finkelhorn et al., 1990). Girls are more likely to be abused\nby family member and boys by strangers. Sexual abuse can create feelings of self-blame, betrayal, shame and guilt in\nchildren (Valente, 2005). Sexual abuse is particularly damaging when the perpetrator is someone the child trusts. Meta-\nanalyses of the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse indicate that survivors have an small increased lifetime risk\nfor some physical and mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, problems with intimacy, and suicide), but that\nmuch recovery is possible (Chen et al., 2010; Hillberg, Hamilton-Giachritsis, & Dixon, 2011; Irish, Kobayashi, & Delahanty,\n2010; Valente, 2005). The presence and severity of long-term effects depend on a host of factors, including the nature\nand duration of the abuse, and the co-occurance of other forms of negect or maltreatment. Sexual abuse is considered a\n156 | Maltreatment, Adversity, and Resilience serious adverse childhood experience, but consistent with work on resilience, most survivors experience much recovery\nonce the abuse has been terminated and some show no lasting harmful effects.\nEffects of toxic stress on young children. Children experience different types of stressors. Normal, everyday stress\ncan provide an opportunity for young children to build coping skills and poses little risk to development. Even more\nlong-lasting stressful events, such as changing schools or losing a loved one, can be managed fairly well. However,\nwhen children experience chronic neglect or abuse over long periods of time, researchers refer to this as toxic stress\nbecause it can produce long-lasting effects. Some of the most concerning are neurobiological (see box, below). Young\nchildren exposed to violence and aggression may blame themselves for neglect or abuse. Children with a history of\nmaltreatment may also show disturbances in attachment, delays in cognitive and language development, as well as\ndeficits in behavioral and emotional self-regulatory skills.\nLong-term, neurophysiological impairments can contribute to higher stress reactivity, emotional dysregulation (e.g.,\nanxiety and depression), and social difficulties such as problems relating to others, lower levels of empathy and\nsympathy, poorer social skills and peer relationships. Neurobiological impairments may also undermine cognitive\ndevelopment, including working memory and executive functioning, contributing to poorer academic motivation and\nperformance. By adolescence, children with a history of abuse are more likely to show aggressive anti-social behavior,\nsubstance abuse, and involvement in delinquency, gangs, and violent crime. Given the complex nature of abuse, it is\noften difficult to sort out the precise mechanisms of effects.\nThe current prevalence of maltreatment underscores the\nneed for more research on processes of healing, recovery,\nFor links to hundreds of resources related to\nand resilience during adolescence and adulthood.\ntrauma-informed practice (ranging from self-\nEspecially encouraging are studies focusing on reversal of\ncare to the workplace to systemic and discipline-\nand recovery from some of the biobehavioral impairments\nspecific resources) see this page from the\nassociated with early exposure to toxic stress. For\nEugene-based Trauma Healing Project.\nexample, studies of the long-term effects of massive\ntrauma such as was experienced by some infants in\nRomanian orphanages has shown the healing power of\nsubsequent experiences in stable, loving, and enriched homes (e.g., Audet & Le Mare, 2011). At the same time, research\ndocumenting the potentially serious and negative long-term effects associated with childhood maltreatment\nunderscore the importance of efforts to prevent, detect, stop, and treat neglect and abuse at the youngest ages possible,\nusing all the public health tools at our disposal.\nAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)\nOver the last 20 years, a framework has become popular that gathers up a variety of sources of early stress, and\nconsiders them together as adverse childhood experiences (or ACEs; CDC, 2019; Merrick, Ford, Ports, & Guinn, 2018;\nPetruccelli, Davis, & Berman, 2019). This area of study was initiated when researchers created a scale that listed\nthe most common of these early developmental risks (i.e., neglect; verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; and family\ndysfunction based on mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence) and asked adults to report whether they\nhad experienced any of them before they turned 18. Researchers then counted the number of experiences (creating\nan index of cumulative risk) and examined whether people with different numbers of ACEs also showed differences in\nphysical or psychological functioning. This line of work revealed two things: ACEs are common\u2013 about 70% of adults\nhave experienced at least one, and 25% at least three. And the number of ACEs, especially when it reaches 4 or more, is\na strong predictor of a range of psychological and physical health problems. Researchers sometimes even estimate the\ncost of ACEs in the number of years they subtract from a person\u2019s average life expectancy.\nBy drawing together events as diverse as maternal death and physical abuse, researchers have learned that these\nexperiences tend to co-occur and that their effects are cumulative. This means, for example, that intimate partner\nMaltreatment, Adversity, and Resilience | 157 violence is often accompanied by maternal depression, neglect, and physical abuse; and it is this combination of events\nthat take their toll. This suggests that it is not possible to understand the effects of any one adverse experience without\nconsidering the entire profile to which a child has been exposed. The more chronic and widespread the experiences, the\nmore serious their impact on development.\nMoreover, an overarching framework has allowed researchers who study different kinds of adversity to realize that\nmany of these early experiences influence subsequent development through a common set of pathways. Many of\nthese experiences interfere with the healthy development of the neurophysiological systems that deal with stress. The\ntwo primary pathways through which early adversity registers in long-term health effects seem to be (1) increases in\nbehavioral risk, in which changes in brain systems render individuals more susceptible to substance abuse and other\nbehaviors that pose health risks; and (2) over and above the effects of risky behaviors, early insult to the immune\nand other biological system leads to greater vulnerability to health conditions later in life (e.g., cardiovascular disease,\ncancer, diabetes, and autoimmune conditions like asthma).\nNeurophysiological effects of early adversity. The stress systems that govern \u201cfight-flight-or-freeze\u201d\nresponses are complex, and involve the endocrine and immune systems; the centers of the brain that\nregulate fear (e.g., the amygdala), pleasure (e.g., the nucleus accumbens), and memory (e.g., the hippocampus);\nand the brain areas that that serve intentional self-regulation, decision-making, and planning. (i.e., the\nprefrontal cortex).When children are chronically overwhelmed by stress, the healthy development of all of\nthese neurobiological systems can be compromised, often at the epigenetic level. An impaired stress\nregulation system interferes broadly with normal cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development and\nmay even undermine long-term psychological and physical health and functioning.\nACEs are found across all demographic groups, but as you might expect from readings on higher-order contexts, those\nwho are low income or de-valued by society may be at higher risk: A study by Merrick and colleagues (2018) found\nsignificantly higher ACE exposure for those who identified as Black, multiracial, lesbian/gay/bisexual, or reported being\nlow income or unemployed or having less than a high school education.\n158 | Maltreatment, Adversity, and Resilience Figure 4.6.\nImages like this, which\nhighlight long term\nphysical, psychological,\nand society risks\nassociated with adverse\nchildhood experiences\n(ACEs) are helpful in\nhighlighting how\nimportant it is to\nprevent ACEs and\nsupport people who have\nexperienced them. An\nunintentional effect of\nsuch images can be\nmaking it seem like early\nadversity inevitably\nleads to these\noutcomes\u2014which is not\nthe case. It is important\nto consider the role of\nfactors that protect and\nbuffer children as well as\nthe incredible human\ncapacity for resilience\nand recovery.\nEarly prevention and intervention. By connecting ACEs to later physical health, this framework has captured the\nattention of pediatricians, who have come to view the prevalence of early adversity as a major public health crisis. Many\npediatricians call for early detection and treatment by routinely screening for ACEs as part of children\u2019s well-baby visits\nstarting in infancy (e.g., see Dr. Nadine Burke Harris\u2019 TED Talk). Pediatricians often screen mothers retrospectively for\nACEs as well, and argue for \u201ctwo generation\u201d treatment in which they work to prevent traumatization of young children\nby treating the effects of ACEs in their mothers.\nThis screening also provides an entry point for engaging at-risk mothers in reflection about their own childhoods and\nthe childhoods they wish to provide for their infants. Research documenting the effects of screening is just beginning\n(Ford et al., 2019), but meta-analyses of interventions designed to reduce the biological impacts of childhood adversity\nare promising (Boparai et al., 2018). Multicomponent interventions target the reduction of ACEs by utilizing professionals\nto provide parenting education, mental health counseling, social service referrals, and social support. Such programs,\nwhich largely target children aged 0-5 years, have been shown to both improve parent-child relationships and reduce\nreduce/reverse many neurophysiological effects in children.\nTo learn more about best evidence for prevention, have a look at this interesting report from the Centers for\nDisease Control.\nCritiques of the ACEs framework. Although the ACEs framework has been useful for practice, it has received a great deal\nof criticism from researchers, largely because it oversimplifies the study of early adversity. Critiques include controversy\nabout what qualifies as an ACE, whether counting is sufficient to account for the interactions among different ACEs,\nand the exclusion in its calculations of any positive childhood experiences that could protect or buffer children from\nMaltreatment, Adversity, and Resilience | 159 some or all of these neurobiological impacts (Lacey & Minnis, 2020; Sege & Browne, 2017). Many researchers also point\nout the problems with retrospective studies (e.g., people currently in a negative state can more easily recall negative\nchildhoods events). As a result, most researchers call for more prospective longitudinal studies that examine different\nkinds of adverse experiences separately. They point out that the effects of different events, like divorce versus sexual\nabuse, may be quite different; and that it is important to examine both the severity and chronicity of these events as\nwell as their combination with other positive and negative experiences. As these more differentiated programs of study\nprogress, the ACEs perspective could then provide an integrative framework within which these strands of work could\nbe compared, contrasted, and eventually woven together.\nResilience\nJust as important as research on adversity is the study of resilience. To date, such research reveals that, no matter\nthe adversity, there is always room for recuperation, gains, and work-arounds to foster improvement in mental and\nphysical functioning. For example, a recent framework, called \u201cHOPE: Health Outcomes from Positive Experiences\u201d\nfocuses on four broad categories of experiences that can buffer the effects early adversity and contribute to healthy\ndevelopment and wellbeing: (1) nurturing, supportive relationships; (2) living, developing, playing, and learning in\nsafe, stable, protective, and equitable environments; (3) having opportunities for constructive social engagement and\nconnectedness; and (4) learning social and emotional competencies (Sege & Browne, 2017). In fact, the same brain\ncharacteristics that contribute to early vulnerability (i.e., malleability, meaning that the brain\u2019s development is open to\nthe effects of adverse experiences) also contribute to later resilience. Such \u201cneuroplasticity\u201d means that the developing\nbrain can also be reshaped by subsequent positive experiences, in this case, enriching and healing social, physical, and\npsychological experiences. Continued exploration of the most effective components of treatment, and whether they are\nage-graded, is an important topic of study in this area.\nFor an overview of work on resilience, here is a report by Harvard University\u2019s Center of the Developing\nChild. You can find three short videos explaining key ideas about resilience here.\nSocietal responsibility for ACEs. As research on ACEs has become more popular, it has been subject to another major\ncritique that also applies to all the other areas of study that focus on child maltreatment: Such work typically fails\nto acknowledge the role that societal factors play in creating and enabling harmful childhood experiences (e.g., Cox\net al., 2018; Walsh, McCartney, Smith, & Armour, 2019). The single biggest predictor of family dysfunction and child\nmaltreatment is the toxic stress of poverty. In the US, poverty is overrepresented in families from ethnic/racial minority\nbackgrounds and in female-headed households, and these subgroups are subject to additional stressors and inequities\nbased on prejudice and discrimination.\nAs discussed in the reading from the previous class on higher-order contexts of parenting, such hazardous conditions\nexert a downward pressure on people\u2019s capacity to provide for a family and take care of children. Although most poor\nand minority parents accomplish these tasks successfully, it is very challenging to protect and buffer children from all of\nthese potential risks. The developmentally dangerous conditions in which many poor children are raised can be thought\nof as societally-sanctioned in that society has agreed that children should only receive as many of the developmental\nbasics they need, such as food and shelter, as their families can afford. One way to significantly reduce the prevalence of\nACEs would be to enact societal policies that reduce poverty. Given the expenses otherwise incurred by potential long-\nterm behavioral and medical outcomes, such policies would not only protect and promote child health and development,\nthey would also save a great deal of money\n160 | Maltreatment, Adversity, and Resilience References\nAmerican Psychological Association.

Once children reach the preschool stage (ages 3\u20136 years), they are capable of initiating activities and\nasserting control over their world through social interactions and play. According to Erikson, preschool children must\nresolve the task of initiative vs. guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while interacting with others, preschool\nchildren can master this task. Children may want to build a fort with the cushions from the living room couch or open\na lemonade stand in the driveway or make a zoo with their stuffed animals and issue tickets to those who want to\ncome. Or they may just want to get themselves ready for bed without any assistance. Initiative, a sense of ambition\nand responsibility, occurs when parents allow a child to explore within limits and then support the child\u2019s choice. To\nreinforce taking initiative, caregivers should offer praise for the child\u2019s efforts and avoid being critical of messes or\nmistakes. Placing pictures of drawings on the refrigerator, purchasing mud pies for dinner, and admiring towers of legos\nwill facilitate the child\u2019s sense of initiative. These children will develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose.\nThose who are unsuccessful at this stage\u2014with their initiative misfiring or stifled by over-controlling parents\u2014may\ndevelop feelings of inadequacy and guilt.\nBehavioral and Emotional Self-Regulation\nOne of the places that the developmental task of initiative vs. guilt is negotiated involves preschoolers\u2019 struggles to learn\nto control their behaviors and emotions. Behavioral self-regulation refers broadly to the self-control individuals use to\nmodify their actions. Sometimes, behaviors need to be modified to so that they are socially appropriate to the context\n(e.g., minding parents or following preschool rules), and sometimes so that they better meet an individual\u2019s own goals\n(e.g., getting a fort built or joining a pretend game). Adaptive behavioral regulation involves staying in touch with your\ngenuine goals while at the same time making intentional decisions about the actions you are going to show in service of\nthose goals.\nSelf\u2010regulation of behavior refers to both:\n1. \u201cDo\u201d regulation: The performance of actions desired by others that we don\u2019t really want to do (\u201cPut away your\ntoys\u201d), and\n2. \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d regulation: Stopping ourselves from doing something we really want to do (\u201cDon\u2019t eat that cookie!\u201d).\nDuring toddlerhood, we see the start of behavioral self-regulation, and it is one of the central tasks of early childhood,\nbut these processes take many years to fully develop. Executive function refers to self-regulatory processes, such as\nthe ability to inhibit a behavior or cognitive flexibility, that enable adaptive responses to new situations or to reach\na specific goal. Executive function skills gradually emerge during early childhood and continue to develop throughout\nchildhood and adolescence. Like many cognitive changes, brain maturation, especially the prefrontal cortex, along with\nexperience influence the development of executive function skills. As executive function improves, children become less\nimpulsive (Traverso, Viterbori, & Usai, 2015). Children show higher executive function skills when parents are warm and\nresponsive, use scaffolding when the child is trying to solve a problem, and provide cognitively stimulating environments\n(Fay-Stammbach, Hawes & Meredith, 2014).\n164 | Self-Regulation When do children start self-regulating and what affects how it develops? Children start regulating their behaviors in\ninfancy, beginning with physiological regulation and consistency in patterns of behavior, such as sleeping and eating.\nHowever, as infants move into toddlerhood, they are faced with the challenge of regulating their behavior as it relates to\nothers in social situations. This type of self-regulation is typically not seen with any degree of consistency until a child\u2019s\nsecond year. However, the capacity to self- regulate may develop earlier or later depending on:\n1. Developmental progress in other areas, such as cognition and working memory, which help children become\naware of what constitutes acceptable social behavior.\n2. The child\u2019s temperament, both reactivity and effortful control.\n3. The quality of parent-child interactions.\n4. The quality of the general home and/or school (day-care) environment.\nWhy is self-regulation important? Being good at behavioral self-regulation (compared to having difficulty regulating\none\u2019s behavior) is associated with numerous positive outcomes for children, including:\n1. More success in the transition to school and better academic achievement once they start school.\n2. Higher levels of social competence, as seen in greater success developing school-based peer relationships.\n3. Fewer problems with externalizing behaviors such as anger and impulsivity.\n4. Higher levels of pro-social behaviors as children move from infancy into toddlerhood and early childhood, and\nincreases in prosocial behavior throughout childhood.\nIn the now classic \u201cMarshmallow Test\u201d (Mischel, Ebbesen, & Zeiss, 1972) children are confronted with the choice of a\nsmall immediate reward (a single marshmallow) and a larger delayed reward (several marshmallows). Walter Mischel\nand his colleagues over the years have found that the ability to delay gratification at the age of four predicted better\nacademic performance and health later in life (Mischel, et al., 2011).\nHow do we study it? The developmental trajectory for self-regulation can be investigated by directly observing the\nnature and frequency of children\u2019s compliant behaviors. Compliance, simply stated, is a child\u2019s cooperation or \u201cgoing\nalong with\u201d the rules and standards of behavior for their immediate environment (e.g., home or school).\nInternalization: How do self-regulation and compliance develop? As a child\u2019s ability to self-regulate develops, so does\nthe nature of compliant behavior. Let\u2019s use getting ready to eat a meal as an example:\n1. When self-regulated behavior is beginning to emerge, compliant behavior requires a high degree of caregiver\nsupport: A very young child will need assistance with hand washing, putting on a bib, and getting seated\n2. Compliance needs less support as self-regulation continues to develop. A child of two may be able to perform\nthese tasks with less or no assistance, but will likely require a reminder and perhaps direct supervision to do them.\n3. Compliance needs very little direct support as children develop more and more self-regulatory skills.\n4. Self-regulatory competence: An older child will be able to get ready for a meal without prompting or assistance.\nIn other words, as a child develops the ability to self-regulate their behavior, the nature of compliance shifts from\nassisted, externally motivated behavior to independent, internally motivated behavior. The development of independent,\ninternally motivated compliance is referred to as \u201cinternalization\u201d and represents a child\u2019s acceptance and understanding\nof, and willingness to behave in accordance with, the rules and standards of their environment.\nEmotional self-regulation. Emotional self-regulation refers specifically to an individual\u2019s ability to recognize and name\nhow they are feeling, and to express their emotions constructively. Adaptive emotion regulation involves staying in\nSelf-Regulation | 165 touch with how you are genuinely feeling while at the same time making intentional decisions about how you are going\nto express those feelings. Three- and four-year-olds learn new ways of expressing their feelings verbally. They also learn\nhow to cope with negative emotions in ways that make themselves feel better\u2014they put their heads down to reduce\nsensory input that may be overwhelming or unpleasant, they talk out loud to reassure themselves that things will be\nokay, and they recalibrate their goals or desires to match the options that are available to them, rather than to continue\nasking for something they cannot have (Thompson & Goodvin, 2007). These strategies, and others, reduce the frequency\nand severity of tantrums, feelings of loneliness, and other unpleasant emotional responses. They can also help children\nremain calm when they are very excited or happy.\nThe same cognitive processes related to self-control and executive function (response initiation, response inhibition,\ndelayed gratification, effortful control, and cognitive flexibility) are responsible for regulating children\u2019s emotions.\nHowever, caretakers can help facilitate adaptive behavior regulation by using goal-focused language (e.g., want, need,\ndon\u2019t like) in everyday conversations, by validating children\u2019s goals and preferences as real and important, by explaining\nprosocial strategies that allow everyone in a given transaction to have their goals and preferences taken into\nconsideration (e.g. by taking turns or sharing), and by being patient. Compared with children with poor behavioral\nregulation skills, those who learn adaptive behavioral and emotional regulation strategies learn more, like school better,\nand are disciplined less frequently. They are also less anxious and stressed, more empathetic, and get along better with\nparents, teachers, and peers (Chang et al., 2003; Colman et al., 2006; Eisenberg et al., 2005; Morris et al., 2011; Raikes et\nal., 2007; Rothbart et al., 2006).\nSocial and Emotional Competence\nSocial and personality development is built from social, biological, and representational influences. These influences\nresult in important developmental outcomes that matter to children, parents, and society: a young adult\u2019s capacity to\nengage in socially constructive actions (helping, caring, sharing with others), to curb hostile or aggressive impulses,\nto live according to meaningful moral values, to develop a healthy identity and sense of self, and to develop talents\nand achieve success in using them. These are some of the developmental outcomes that denote social and emotional\ncompetence.\nThese achievements of social and personality development derive from the interaction of many social, biological, and\nrepresentational influences. Consider, for example, the development of conscience, which is an early foundation for\nmoral development.\nConscience consists of the cognitive, emotional, and social influences that cause young children to create and act\nconsistently with internalized standards of right and wrong (Kochanska, 2002). It emerges from young children\u2019s\nexperiences with parents, particularly in the development of a mutually responsive relationship that motivates young\nchildren to respond constructively to the parents\u2019 requests and expectations. Biologically-based temperament is\ninvolved, as some children are temperamentally more capable of motivated self-regulation (a quality called effortful\ncontrol) than are others, while some children are more prone to the fear and anxiety that parental disapproval can evoke.\nThe development of conscience is influenced by having a good fit between the child\u2019s temperamental qualities and the\nways parents communicate and reinforce behavioral expectations.\nConscience development also expands as young children begin to represent moral values and think of themselves as\nmoral beings. By the end of the preschool years, for example, young children develop a \u201cmoral self\u201d by which they think\nof themselves as people who want to do the right thing, who feel badly after misbehaving, and who feel uncomfortable\nwhen others misbehave. In the development of conscience, young children become more socially and emotionally\ncompetent in a manner that provides a foundation for later moral conduct (Thompson, 2012).\n166 | Self-Regulation Required Reading: Moral Development\nTo learn about moral development during early childhood, please read the following article from Open\nUniversity: \u201cMoral Behaviour\u201d\nReferences\nChang, L., Schwartz, D., Dodge, K.

According to Piaget, this stage occurs from the\nage of 2 to 7 years. In the preoperational stage, children use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is\nwhy children in this stage engage in pretend play. A child\u2019s arms might become airplane wings as she zooms around\nthe room, or a child with a stick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the\npreoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information. The term operational\nrefers to logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered pre-operational. Children\u2019s logic is\nbased on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional knowledge.\nThe preoperational period is divided into two stages:\n1. The symbolic function substage occurs between 2 and 4 years of age and is characterized by gains in symbolic\nthinking, in which the child is able to mentally represent an object that is not present, and a dependence on\nperception in problem solving.\n2. The intuitive thought substage, lasting from 4 to 7 years, is marked by greater dependence on intuitive thinking\nrather than just perception (Thomas, 1979). This implies that children think automatically without using evidence.\nAt this stage, children ask many questions as they attempt to understand the world around them using immature\nreasoning. Let us examine some of Piaget\u2019s assertions about children\u2019s cognitive abilities at this age.\nPretend play. Pretending is a favorite activity at this time. A toy\nhas qualities beyond the way it was designed to function and\ncan now be used to stand for a character or object unlike\nanything originally intended. A teddy bear, for example, can be\na baby or the queen of a faraway land. Piaget believed that\npretend play helped children practice and solidify new\nschemata they were developing cognitively. This play, then,\nreflected changes in their conceptions or thoughts. However,\nchildren also learn as they pretend and experiment. Their play\ndoes not simply represent what they have learned (Berk, 2007).\nSymbolic representation. In addition to ushering in an era of\nFigure 5.1\npretend play, the development of symbolic representation\nrevolutionizes the way young children can think and act. Representational capacities underlie the emergence of\nlanguage which opens up channels of communication with others and provides young children words and concepts for\ntheir inner experiences (like emotion labels). Symbolic capacities also scaffold the development of memory, and allow\nyoung children to remember and discuss autobiographical events. They become very interested in two dimensional\nrepresentations, like photographs and computer screens, and can interact with grandparents and others using these\ntools.\nAs seen at the end of the sensorimotor period, toddlers begin to use primitive representations to solve problems in\ntheir heads. During the preschool years, cognitive advances allow them to get better and better at trying out strategies\nCognitive Development | 169 mentally before taking action. Hence, planning and problem-solving become central activities. Problem-solving can be\nused to facilitate physical play (e.g., planning how to build a castle), solve interpersonal conflicts (e.g., two children want\nthe same toy), or figure out how to comfort oneself when one is sad.\nMental representations are also key to the advances in executive function and self-regulation described earlier.\nWhen children can hold goals in their minds that are different from the ones that spontaneously emerge, they use\nrepresentations of what they are supposed to do to modulate or manage what they want to do. Young children show\nan outpouring of representational activities, including language, pretend play, story telling, singing, drawing, looking a\nphotos, and discussing the past and present. They love to engage in joint problem-solving and be read to, often asking\nfor the same book or video over and over again, pouring over and discussing the story, until they can repeat every word.\nDespite the many advances that symbolic thought brings to young children, there are still several significant limitations\nto their thinking, including egocentrism, perceptual salience, and animism. When parents see behaviors typical of the\npreoperational stage, it is important that they correctly interpret their meaning. Young children are not being hard\nto get along with. These behaviors are the result of genuine limitations in their cognitive functioning. Young children\ncan understand many ideas and follow rules, but for the best developmental outcomes, adults should temper their\nexpectations and demands so that they are reasonable, and explain their thinking using language that is developmentally\nattuned to children\u2019s current cognitive capacities.\nEgocentrism. Egocentrism in early childhood refers to the tendency of young children not to be able to take the perspective\nof others, and instead the child thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do. Egocentric children are not able\nto infer the perspective of other people and instead attribute their own perspective to everyone in the situation. For\nexample, ten-year-old Keiko\u2019s birthday is coming up, so her mom takes 3-year-old Kenny to the toy store to choose a\npresent for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his sister will too.\nPiaget\u2019s classic experiment on egocentrism involved showing\nchildren a three-dimensional model of a mountain and asking\nthem to describe what a doll that is looking at the mountain\nfrom a different angle might see (see Figure 5.2). Children tend\nto choose a picture that represents their own, rather than the\ndoll\u2019s view. By age 7 children are less self-centered. However,\neven younger children when speaking to others tend to use\ndifferent sentence structures and vocabulary when addressing\na younger child or an older adult. This indicates some\nawareness of the views of others.\nPerceptual salience. Perceptual salience means that children\nreason, not based on what they know, but based on what they\nperceive (ie.g., see and hear) in the present local context. This\ncognitive limitation is on display every Halloween, when\nparents dress up, especially if they use masks. For a\npreoperational child, the mask is so perceptually salient that\nFigure 5.2. What does dolly see?\neven if the parent continues to talk and the child can recognize\ntheir voice, their experience is overwhelmed by the transformation of the parent\u2019s face, that they react to the masked\nparent as if they were a stranger. At this age, children\u2019s understanding is halfway between the reasoning based on action\nof the sensorimotor period and the reasoning based on logic of the concrete operational period. During the\npreoperational period, reasoning is based on empirical reality, that is, information provided by the senses.\nAnimism. Animism refers to attributing life-like qualities to objects. The cup is alive, the chair that falls down and hits\nthe child\u2019s ankle is mean, and the toys need to stay home because they are tired. Cartoons frequently show objects that\n170 | Cognitive Development appear alive and take on lifelike qualities. Young children do seem to think that objects that move may be alive, but after\nage three, they seldom refer to objects as being alive (Berk, 2007).\nIntuitive substage (age 4-7 years). During the intuitive substage, children begin to move toward logical thinking. They\nshow some signs of logical reasoning, but can\u2019t explain how or why they think as they do. This is an age filled with\nquestions, as children begin to make sense of their worlds. Parents should know that children\u2019s ceaseless \u201cwhy?\u201d\nquestions do not require detailed explanations. They are looking for brief and simple explanations. For example, if\nchildren ask \u201cWhy do I have to wear a helmet when I ride a bicycle?\u201d they are not looking for a lecture on legal issues,\nbut just a simple \u201cTo keep your head safe.\u201d Likewise, if they come back from a bike ride and say \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t fall down,\nso now I don\u2019t need to wear a helmet any more\u201d, you can explain the idea of risk through an everyday example, saying,\n\u201cYou have to wear it every time, because you could fall down.\u201d If you want to try a metaphor, you could explain, \u201d Your\nhead is like a glass, it could get broken. Does a glass break every time you drop it? No. But does that mean that it\u2019s a good\nidea to drop it? No. We want to keep your head safe.\u201d\nCentration. The primary limitation of thought during the intuitive substage is called centration. Centration means that\nunderstanding is dominated (i.e., centered on) a single feather\u2013 the most perceptually salient one. At this age, children\ncannot hold or coordinate two features of an object at the same time. Piaget demonstrated this aspect of preoperational\nthought in a series of experiments. They showed that young children do not yet have the logical notion of conservation,\nwhich refers to the ability to recognize that aspects like quantity remain the same, even when over transformations in\nappearance.\nInability to conserve. Using Kenny and Keiko again, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to\n3-year-old Kenny. Kenny\u2019s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she\ndid. Kenny did not understand that cutting the pizza into smaller pieces did not increase the overall amount. This was\nbecause Kenny exhibited centration when he focused on only one characteristic (the number of pieces) to the exclusion\nof others (total amount). Kenny\u2019s reasoning was based on his five pieces of pizza compared to his sister\u2019s one piece even\nthough the total amount of pizza each had was the same. Keiko was able to consider several characteristics of an object\nthan just one. Because children have not developed this understanding of conservation, they cannot perform mental\noperations.\nThe classic Piagetian experiment associated with conservation\ninvolves liquid (Crain, 2005). As seen on the left side of Figure\n5.3, the child is shown two glasses which are filled to the same\nlevel and asked if they have the same amount. Usually the child\nagrees they have the same amount. The experimenter then\npours the liquid in one glass to a taller and thinner glass (as\nFigure 5.3. Conservation of Liquid. Does pouring liquid in a\ntall, narrow container make it have more? shown in the center of Figure 5.3). The child is again asked if the\ntwo glasses have the same amount of liquid. The preoperational\nchild will typically say the taller glass now has more liquid because it is taller (as shown on the right side). The child has\ncentrated on the height of the glass and fails to conserve.\nClassification errors. Preoperational children also demonstrate centration when they have difficulty understanding that\nan object can be classified in more than one way. For example, if shown three white buttons and four black buttons\nand asked whether there are more black buttons or buttons, the child is likely to respond that there are more black\nbuttons. They focus on the most salient feature (black buttons) and cannot keep in mind the the general class of buttons,\nso they compare black versus white buttons, instead of part versus whole. Because young children lack these general\nclasses, their reasoning is typically transductive, that is, making faulty inferences from one specific example to another.\nFor example, Piaget\u2019s daughter Lucienne stated she had not had her nap, therefore it was not afternoon. She did not\nunderstand that afternoons are a time period and her nap was just one of many events that occurred in the afternoon\nCognitive Development | 171 (Crain, 2005). As the child\u2019s capacity to mentally represent and coordinate multiple features improves, the ability to\nclassify objects emerges.\nCritique of Piaget. Similar to the critique of the sensorimotor period, several psychologists have attempted to show\nthat Piaget also underestimated the intellectual capabilities of the preoperational child. For example, children\u2019s specific\nexperiences can influence when they are able to conserve. Children of pottery makers in Mexican villages know\nthat reshaping clay does not change the amount of clay at much younger ages than children who do not have\nsimilar experiences (Price-Williams, Gordon, & Ramirez, 1969). Crain (2005) also showed that under certain conditions\npreoperational children can think rationally about mathematical and scientific tasks, and they are not always as\negocentric as Piaget implied. Research on theory of mind (discussed later in the chapter) shows that some children\novercome egocentrism by 4 or 5 years of age, which is sooner than Piaget indicated. As with sensorimotor development,\nPiaget seemed to be right about the exact sequence and the processes involved in cognitive development, as well\nas when these steps are typically observable under naturalistic conditions. But current research has provided more\naccurate estimates of the exact ages when underlying capacities emerge, which could only be revealed by working with\nchildren in specific experimental conditions that removed barriers to their performance.\nVygotsky\u2019s Sociocultural Theory: Changes in Thought with Guidance\nModern social learning theories stem from the work of Russian psychologist\nLev Vygotsky, who produced his ideas as a reaction to existing conflicting\napproaches in psychology (Kozulin, 1990). Vygotsky\u2019s ideas are most\nrecognized for identifying the role of social interactions and culture in the\ndevelopment of higher-order thinking skills. His theory is especially valuable\nfor the insights it provides about the dynamic \u201cinterdependence between\nindividual and social processes in the construction of knowledge\u201d (John-\nSteiner & Mahn, 1996, p. 192). Vygotsky\u2019s views are often considered primarily\nas developmental theories, focusing on qualitative changes in behavior over\ntime, that attempt to explain unseen processes of development in thought,\nlanguage, and higher-order thinking skills. Although Vygotsky\u2019s intent was\nmainly to understand higher psychological processes in children, his ideas\nhave many practical applications for learners of all ages.\nThree themes are often identified with Vygotsky\u2019s ideas of sociocultural\nlearning: (1) human development and learning originate in social, historical,\nand cultural interactions, (2) the use of psychological tools, particularly\nFigure 5.4. Lev Vygotsky language, mediates the development of higher mental functions, and (3)\nlearning occurs within the Zone of Proximal Development. While we discuss\nthese ideas separately, they are closely interrelated.\nSociocultural theory. Vygotsky\u2019s sociocultural theory emphasizes the importance of culture and social interaction in\nthe development of cognitive abilities. Vygotsky contended that thinking has social origins, social interactions play a\ncritical role especially in the development of higher-order thinking skills, and cognitive development cannot be fully\nunderstood without considering the social and historical context within which it is embedded. He explained, \u201cEvery\nfunction in the child\u2019s cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first\nbetween people (interpsychological) and then inside the child (intrapsychological)\u201d (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 57). It is through\nworking with others on a variety of tasks that a learner adopts socially shared experiences and associated effects and\nacquires useful strategies and knowledge (Scott & Palincsar, 2013).\n172 | Cognitive Development Rogoff (1990) refers to this process as guided participation, where a learner actively acquires new culturally valuable\nskills and capabilities through a meaningful, collaborative activity with an assisting, more experienced other. It is critical\nto notice that these culturally mediated functions are viewed as being embedded in sociocultural activities rather than\nbeing self-contained. Development is a \u201ctransformation of participation in a sociocultural activity\u201d not a transmission of\ndiscrete cultural knowledge or skills (Matusov, 2015, p. 315). For example, young children learn problem-solving skills,\nnot by sitting alone at a desk trying to solve arbitrary problems, but by working alongside parents or older siblings as\nthey work on actual culturally-relevant tasks, like preparing a family meal or repairing a fence. Working together, the\ndyad or group encounter social or physical problems, and discuss their possible solutions before taking action. Through\nparticipation in joint problem-solving, young children develop these skills.\nLanguage as a developmental tool. In his sociocultural view of development, Vygotsky highlighted the tools that the\nculture provides to support the development of higher order thought. Chief among them is language. For Vygotsky,\nchildren interact with the world through the tool of language. For Piaget, children use schemas that they construct and\norganize on the mental plane, but for Vygotsky, language, a social medium, was the mechanism through which we build\nknowledge of the world. He believed that with development, the language we acquire from our environment shapes the\nways in which we think and behave. With development, language becomes internalized as thought (i.e., cognition, or\nreasoning) and children use this internalized language to guide their action.\nScaffolding and the \u201cZone of Proximal Development.\u201d Vygotsky differed with Piaget in that he believed that a person\nnot only has a set of actual abilities, but also a set of potential abilities that can be realized if given the proper\nguidance from others. He believed that through guided participation known as scaffolding, with a teacher or capable\npeer, a child can learn cognitive skills within a certain range known as the zone of proximal development. Both\nPiaget and Vygotsky highlighted the importance of interactions with the social and physical world as the sources\nof developmental change, Piaget\u2019s ideas of cognitive development emphasized universal stages progressing toward\nincreasing cognitive complexity. Vygotsky presents a more culturally-embedded view in which situated participatory\nlearning drives development. The idea of learning driving development, rather than being determined by the\ndevelopmental level of the learner, fundamentally changes our understanding of the learning process and has significant\ninstructional and educational implications (Miller, 2011).\nHave you ever taught a child to perform a task? Maybe it was brushing their teeth or preparing food. Chances are you\nspoke to them and described what you were doing while you demonstrated the skill and let them work along with you\nthroughout the process. You gave them assistance when they seemed to need it, but once they knew what to do, you\nstood back and let them go. This is scaffolding. This approach to teaching has also been adopted by educators. Rather\nthan assessing students on what they are doing, they should be understood in terms of what they are capable of doing\nwith the proper guidance and mentoring.\nThis difference in assumptions has significant implications for the design and development of learning experiences. If we\nbelieve as Piaget did that development precedes learning, then we will introduce children to learning activities involving\nnew concepts and problems, but follow their lead, allowing learners to initiate participation when they are ready or\ninterested. On the other hand, if we believe as Vygotsky did that learning drives development and that development\noccurs as we learn a variety of concepts and principles, recognizing their applicability to new tasks and new situations,\nthen our instructional design will look very different.\nSection Glossary\nScaffolding: a process in which adults or capable peers model or demonstrate how to solve a problem, and then step\nback, offering support as needed.\nSociocultural Theory: Vygotsky\u2019s theory that emphasizes how cognitive development proceeds as a result of social\ninteractions between members of a culture, and relies on cultural tools like language.\nCognitive Development | 173 Zone of Proximal Development: what a learner can do with help from more competent others; sits in the gap between\nwhat a learner can do alone without help, and what the learner cannot yet do.\nTheory of Mind\nTheory of mind refers to the ability to think about other people\u2019s thoughts (also known as meta-cognition\u2014that is, thinking\nabout thinking). Theory of mind is the understanding that other people experience mental states (for instance, thoughts,\nbeliefs, feelings, or desires) that are different from our own, and that their mental states are what guide their behavior.\nThis skill, which emerges in early childhood, helps humans to infer, predict, and understand the reactions of others, thus\nplaying a crucial role in social development and in promoting competent social interactions.\nOne common method for determining if a child has reached this mental milestone is called the false belief task. The\nresearch began with a clever experiment by Wimmer and Perner (1983), who tested whether children can pass a false-\nbelief test (see Figure 5.5). The child is shown a picture story of Sally, who puts her ball in a basket and leaves the room.\nWhile Sally is out of the room, Anne comes along and takes the ball from the basket and puts it inside a box. The child is\nthen asked where Sally thinks the ball is located when she comes back to the room. Is she going to look first in the box\nor in the basket? The right answer is that she will look in the basket, because that is where she put it and thinks it is;\nbut we have to infer this false belief against our own better knowledge that the ball is in the box. This is very difficult for\nchildren before the age of four because of the cognitive effort it takes.\nThree-year-olds have difficulty distinguishing between what they once thought was true and what they now know to be\ntrue. They feel confident that what they know now is what they have always known (Birch & Bloom, 2003). You could say\nthat their perspectives are fused: whatever is actually true is what they and everyone else thinks. Even adults need to\nthink through this task (Epley, Morewedge, & Keysar, 2004). To be successful at solving this type of task, the child must\nseparate three things: (1) what is true; (2) what they themselves think (which can be false); and (3) what someone else\nthinks (which can be different from what they think as well as different from reality). Can you see why this task is so\ncomplex?\n174 | Cognitive Development In Piagetian terms, children must give up a tendency\ntoward egocentrism. The child must also understand that\nwhat guides people\u2019s actions and responses are what they\nbelieve rather than what is actually true. In other words,\npeople can mistakenly believe things that are false (called\nfalse beliefs) and will act based on this false knowledge.\nConsequently, prior to age four children are rarely\nsuccessful at solving such tasks (Wellman, Cross &\nWatson, 2001).\nResearchers examining the development of theory of\nmind have been concerned by the overemphasis on the\nmastery of false belief as the primary measure of whether\na child has attained theory of mind. Two-year-olds\nunderstand the diversity of desires, yet as noted earlier it\nis not until age four or five that children grasp false\nbeliefs, and often not until middle childhood do they\nunderstand that people may hide how they really feel. In\npart, because children\u2019s understanding is fused: in early\nchildhood children do not differentiate genuine feelings\nfrom the expression of feelings. They have difficulty\nhiding how they really feel (e.g., saying thank you for a gift\nthey do not really like). Wellman and his colleagues\n(Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu & Liu, 2006) suggest that theory\nof mind is comprised of a number of components, each\nwith its own developmental timeline (see Table 5.1).\nTable 5.1 Components of Theory of Mind\nFigure 5.5. Sally\u2013Anne task to test children\u2019s ability to infer false\nbeliefs.\nStage, Component Description\nDesire Psychology (ages 2-3)\nUnderstanding that two people may have different desires regarding the same\nDiverse-desires\nobject.\nBelief Psychology (ages 3 or 4 to 5)\nDiverse-beliefs Understanding that two people may hold different beliefs about an object.\nKnowledge access (knowledge/\nUnderstanding that people may or may not have access to information.\nignorance)\nFalse belief Understanding that someone might hold a belief based on false information.\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nCognitive Development | 175 Those in early childhood in the US, Australia, and Germany develop theory of mind in the sequence outlined in\nTable 4.2. Yet, Chinese and Iranian preschoolers acquire knowledge access before diverse beliefs (Shahaeian, Peterson,\nSlaughter & Wellman, 2011). Shahaeian and colleagues suggested that cultural differences in child-rearing may account\nfor this reversal. Parents in collectivistic cultures, such as China and Iran, emphasize conformity to the family and\ncultural values, greater respect for elders, and the acquisition of knowledge and academic skills more than they do\nautonomy and social skills (Frank, Plunkett & Otten, 2010). This could reduce the degree of familial conflict of opinions\nexpressed in the family. In contrast, individualistic cultures encourage children to think for themselves and assert their\nown opinion, and this could increase the risk of conflict in beliefs being expressed by family members. As a result,\nchildren in individualistic cultures would acquire insight into the question of diversity of belief earlier, while children\nin collectivistic cultures would acquire knowledge access earlier in the sequence. The role of conflict in aiding the\ndevelopment of theory of mind may account for the earlier age of onset of an understanding of false belief in children\nwith siblings, especially older siblings (McAlister & Petersen, 2007; Perner, Ruffman & Leekman, 1994).\nThis awareness of the existence of theory of mind is part of social intelligence, such as recognizing that others can think\ndifferently about situations. It helps us to be self-conscious or aware that others can think of us in different ways and\nit helps us to be able to be understanding or be empathic toward others. Moreover, this \u201cmind reading\u201d ability helps us\nto anticipate and predict people\u2019s actions. The awareness of the mental states of others is important for communication\nand social skills.\nLanguage Development\nThe development of symbolic representation during the second year of life leads to an explosion of language\ngrowth during toddlerhood and early childhood.\nVocabulary growth. Between the ages of two to six, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands from about 200 words to over 10,000\nwords. This \u201cvocabulary spurt\u201d typically involves 10-20 new words per week and is accomplished through a process\ncalled fast-mapping. Words are easily learned by making connections between new words and concepts already known.\nThe parts of speech that are learned depend on the language and what is emphasized. Children speaking verb-friendly\nlanguages, such as Chinese and Japanese, learn verbs more readily, while those speaking English tend to learn nouns\nmore readily. at the same time, children learning less verb-friendly languages, such as English, seem to need assistance\nin grammar to master the use of verbs (Imai et al., 2008).\nLiteral meanings. Children can repeat words and phrases after having heard them only once or twice, but they do not\nalways understand the meaning of the words or phrases. This is especially true of expressions or figures of speech which\nare taken literally. For example, a classroom full of preschoolers hears the teacher say, \u201cWow! That was a piece of cake!\u201d\nThe children may begin asking \u201cCake? Where is my cake? I want cake!\u201d Or when a young child falls down and scrapes\nher knee, and she hears a parent say \u201cOh your poor knee\u201d as they put on a band-aid, the parent should not be surprised\nif, when the child falls down and scapes an elbow, she shows it to the parent and says\u2013 \u201cOh, man, I got another knee.\u201d\nOverregularization. Children learn rules of grammar as they learn language but may apply these rules inappropriately\nat first. For instance, a child learns to add \u201ced\u201d to the end of a word to indicate past tense. Then forms a sentence such\nas \u201cI goed there. I doed that.\u201d This is typical at ages two and three. Even without any correction, those mistakes will soon\ndisappear, and they will learn new words such as \u201cwent\u201d and \u201cdid\u201d to be used in those situations.\nThe impact of training. Remember Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development? Children can be assisted in\nlearning language by others who listen attentively, model more accurate pronunciations and encourage elaboration.\nThe child exclaims, \u201cI\u2019m goed there!\u201d and the adult responds, \u201cYou went there? Where did you go?\u201d No corrections\nare needed. Children may be ripe for language as Chomsky suggests, but active participation in helping them learn\n176 | Cognitive Development is important for language development as well. The process of scaffolding is one in which the guide provides needed\nassistance to the child as a new skill is learned.\nBilingualism\nAlthough monolingual speakers often do not realize it, the majority of children around the world are bilingual, meaning\nthat they understand and use two languages (Meyers-Sutton, 2005). Even in the United States, which is a relatively\nmonolingual society, more than 60 million people (21%) speak a language other than English at home (Camarota &\nZeigler, 2014; Ryan, 2013). Children who are dual language learners are one of the fastest growing populations in the\nUnited States (Hammer et al., 2014). They make up nearly 30% of children enrolled in early childhood programs, like\nHead Start. By the time they enter school, they are very heterogeneous in their language and literacy skills, with\nsome children showing delays in proficiency in either one or both languages (Hammer et al., 2014). Hoff (2018) reports\nlanguage competency is dependent on the quantity, quality, and opportunity to use a language. Dual language learners\nmay hear the same number of words and phrases (quantity) overall, as do monolingual children, but it is split between\ntwo languages (Hoff, 2018). Thus, in any single language they may be exposed to fewer words. They will show higher\nexpressive and receptive skills in the language they come to hear the most.\nIn addition, the quality of the languages spoken to the child may differ in bilingual versus monolingual families. Place\nand Hoff (2016) found that for many immigrant children in the United States, most of the English heard was spoken\nby a non-native speaker of the language. Finally, many children in bilingual households will sometimes avoid using the\nfamily\u2019s heritage language in favor of the majority language (DeHouwer, 2007, Hoff, 2018). A common pattern in Spanish-\nEnglish homes, is for the parents to speak to the child in Spanish, but for the child to respond in English. As a result,\nchildren may show little difference in the receptive skills between English and Spanish, but better expressive skills in\nEnglish (Hoff, 2018).\nThere are several studies that have documented the advantages of learning more than one language in childhood for\ncognitive executive function skills. Bilingual children consistently outperform monolinguals on measures of inhibitory\ncontrol, such as ignoring irrelevant information (Bialystok, Martin & Viswanathan, 2005). Studies also reveal an\nadvantage for bilingual children on measures of verbal working memory (Kaushanskaya, Gross, & Buac, 2014; Yoo &\nKaushanskaya, 2012) and non-verbal working memory (Bialystok, 2011). However, it has been reported that among lower\nSES populations the working memory advantage is not always found (Bonifacci, Giombini, Beloocchi, & Conteno, 2011).\nThere is also considerable research to show that being bilingual, either as a child or an adult, leads to greater\nefficiency in the word learning process. Monolingual children are strongly influenced by the mutual-exclusivity bias,\nthe assumption that an object has only a single name (Kaushanskaya, Gross, & Buac, 2014). For example, a child who has\npreviously learned the word car, may be confused when this object is referred to as an automobile or sedan. Research\nshows that monolingual children find it easier to learn the name of a new object, than acquiring a new name for a\npreviously labelled object. In contrast, bilingual children and adults show little difficulty with either task (Kaushanskaya\n& Marian, 2009). This finding may be explained by the experience bilinguals have in translating between languages when\nreferring to familiar objects.\nEducational programs should take advantage of the preschool years as a time when children are developmentally primed\nto learn more than one language. The practice in the US of waiting until middle or high school to learn a second language\nflies in the face of the natural developmental progression of language learning. Systematic instruction, practice, reading,\nand writing in multiple languages would allow young children to become bilingual and bi-literate during a developmental\nperiod when that is relatively easy. That is why many school districts offer immersion programs in multiple languages\nstarting in preschool or Kindergarten. School districts who serve many children who speak first languages other than\nEnglish can take advantage of their skills and support bilingualism in all their pupils.\nCognitive Development | 177 Early Childhood Education\nProviding universal preschool has become an important lobbying point for federal, state, and local leaders throughout\nour country. In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama called upon congress to provide high quality\npreschool for all children. He continued to support universal preschool in his legislative agenda, and in December 2014\nthe President convened state and local policymakers for the White House Summit on Early Education (White House\nPress Secretary, 2014). However, universal preschool covering all four-year olds in the country would require significant\nfunding. Further, how effective preschools are in preparing children for elementary school, and what constitutes high\nquality preschool have been debated.\nTo set criteria for designation as a high-quality preschool, the National Association for the Education of Young Children\n(NAEYC) identifies 10 standards (NAEYC, 2016). These include:\n\u2022 Positive and caring relationships among all children and adults are promoted.\n\u2022 The curriculum supports learning and development in social, emotional, physical, language, and cognitive areas.\n\u2022 Teaching approaches are developmentally, culturally, and linguistically attuned.\n\u2022 Children\u2019s progress is assessed to provide information on their learning and development.\n\u2022 Children\u2019s health and nutrition are promoted, while they are protected from illness and injury.\n\u2022 Teachers possess the educational qualifications, knowledge, and commitment to promote children\u2019s learning.\n\u2022 Collaborative relationships with families are established and maintained.\n\u2022 Relationships with agencies and institutions in the children\u2019s communities are established to support the\nprogram\u2019s goals.\n\u2022 Indoor and outdoor physical environments are safe and well-maintained.\n\u2022 Leadership and management personnel are well qualified, effective, and maintain licensure status with the\napplicable state agency.\nParents should review preschool programs using criteria such as those set by NAEYC as a guide and template for asking\nquestions that will assist them in choosing the best program for their child. Selecting the right preschool is also difficult\nbecause there are so many types of preschools available. Zachry (2013) identified Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia,\nHigh Scope, Parent Co-Ops and Bank Street as types of preschool programs, approaches, and curricula that focus on\nchildren learning through discovery. Teachers act as guides and create activities based on the child\u2019s developmental\nlevel.\n178 | Cognitive Development Head Start. For children who live in poverty, Head Start has\nbeen providing preschool education since 1965 when it was\nbegun by President Lyndon Johnson as part of his war on\npoverty. It currently serves nearly one million children and\nannually costs approximately 7.5 billion dollars (United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 2015). However,\nconcerns about the effectiveness of Head Start have been\nongoing since the program began. Armor (2015) reviewed\nexisting research on Head Start and found there were no lasting\ngains, and the average child in Head Start had not learned more\nthan children who did not receive preschool education. One\nstudy showed that 3-and 4-year-old children in Head Start Figure 5.6. Four year old head start students\nreceived \u201cpotentially positive effects\u201d on general reading\nachievement, but no noticeable effects on math achievement and social-emotional development (Barshay, 2015).\nNonexperimental designs are a significant problem in determining the effectiveness of Head Start programs because\na control group is needed to show group differences that would demonstrate educational benefits. Because of ethical\nreasons, low income children are usually provided with some type of pre-school programming in an alternative setting.\nAdditionally, Head Start programs are different depending on the location, and these differences include the length\nof the day or qualification of the teachers. Lastly, testing young children is difficult and strongly dependent on their\nlanguage skills and comfort level with an evaluator (Barshay, 2015).\nDespite the challenges in researching the effectiveness of Head Start, the social and economic benefits of investing\nin universal preschool cannot be overstated. This is especially true for preschool programs that serve disadvantaged\nchildren and communities. Researchers and economists have estimated that investing in the cost of Head Start for a\nsingle child\u2014about $17,000\u2014can yield a return to society of between $300,000 and $500,000 over that child\u2019s lifetime\n(Heckman et al., 2010). This substantial economic return (potentially saving our society billions of dollars in the long run)\ncomes in the form of lower high school dropout rates, lower unemployment rates, and lower rates of incarceration\u2014all\nof which have been documented for individuals who had academic and social supports during early childhood (Heckman\net al., 2010). Similar to the concept of preventative healthcare, the benefits of investing in early education for children\nin poor or underserved communities today will add up over time, and will yield greater societal benefits than we would\nexpect from programs that implement interventions after problems emerge (for example, remedial schooling, job re-\ntraining, or substance abuse rehabilitation; Heckman, 2006).\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 This Ted Talk features a seasoned school teacher, who discusses the importance of building strong and positive\nrelationships with students.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

They are\nconstantly doing, planning, playing, getting together with friends, and achieving. This is a very active time, and a time\nwhen they are gaining a sense of how they measure up when compared with peers. Erikson believed that if these\nindustrious children can be successful in their endeavors, they will get a sense of confidence for future challenges. If\ninstead, a child feels that they are not measuring up to their peers, feelings of inferiority and self-doubt will develop.\nThese feelings of inferiority can, according to Erikson, lead to an inferiority complex that lasts into adulthood. To help\nchildren successfully negotiate this stage, they should be encouraged to explore their abilities. They should be given\nauthentic feedback as well. Failure is not necessarily a horrible thing according to Erikson. Indeed, failure is a type of\nfeedback which may help a child form a sense of modesty. A balance of competence and modesty is ideal for creating a\nsense of competence in the child.\nPlay and Peers | 185 The Role of Play in Development\nWhat is Play? Play is spontaneous fun activity found at all ages\nand in all cultures. Play begins in infancy. Freud analyzed play\nin terms of emotional development. Vygotsky and Piaget saw\nplay as a way for children to develop their intellectual abilities\n(Dyer & Moneta, 2006). Piaget called play \u201ca child\u2019s work.\u201d\nSubsequent research has shown that play provides many\npositive outcomes for children in all domains of development.\nThe activity of play provides children opportunities to exercise\nall their developing capacities: physical, cognitive, emotional,\nand social. Play is spontaneous; children are intrinsically\nmotivated to play. Play may be done alone or with others. It\nFigure 6.1 often involves pretending and make-believe.\nTypes of Play. In a classic study, Parten (1932) observed two to five-year-old children and noted six types of play: Three\nlabeled as non-social play (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and three categorized as social play (parallel, associative,\nand cooperative). The following Table describes each type of play. Younger children engage in non-social play more than\nolder children; by age five associative and cooperative play are the most common forms of play (Dyer & Moneta, 2006).\nTable 6.1 Parten's Classification of Types of Play in Preschool Children\nCategory Description\nUnoccupied\nChildren's behavior seems more random and without a specific goal. This is the least common form of play.\nPlay\nChildren play by themselves, do not interact with others, nor are they engaging in similar activities as the children\nSolitary Play\naround them.\nOnlooker Children are observing other children playing. They may comment on the activities and even make suggestions, but\nPlay will not directly join the play.\nParallel Play Children play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not directly act with each other.\nAssociative\nChildren will interact with each other and share toys, but are not working toward a common goal.\nPlay\nCooperative\nChildren are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may take on different tasks to reach that goal.\nPlay\nadapted from Paris, Ricardo, & Rymond, 2019\nPretend Play. Pretense is a familiar characteristic of play. Pretend play can be combined with physical play or playing\nwith objects. When pretending, children act as-if; they engage in make-believe. Their words and actions are not literal,\nbut evoke something beyond what is concretely present (Lillard, Lerner, Hopkins, Dore, Smith, and Palmquist, 2015).\nIn his study of cognitive development, Piaget was interested in pretend play and he documented the way in which it\ninvolved symbolic thought, that is, the ability to have a symbol represent something in the real world. A toy, for example,\nhas qualities beyond the way it was designed to function, and can be used to stand for a character or a completely\ndifferent object. A banana can be used as a telephone. As seen in the study of early childhood, symbolic thought is an\nimportant capability developed at the end of the sensorimotor stage that paves the way for the development of language.\nBut pretend play uses capabilities that go beyond symbolic thought and mental representation.\n186 | Play and Peers Pretend play also requires the use of fantasy and imagination\n(Sobel & Lillard, 2001). Imagination is distinct from, but jointly\nengaged during play with executive function, including the\ndeveloping capabilities of memory, inhibition, and attention\nshifting (Carlson & White, 2013). A complex form of pretend play\nemerges in Parten\u2019s last two stages, associative play, and\ncooperative play. This new form is sociodramatic play, which is\nmake-believe play with others, involving objects and actions\nwoven into some kind of imagined situation or story. It is often\nscaffolded in play with adults or older children. As the\ndevelopment of sociodramatic play progresses, children begin\nacting out roles. They use situated imaginary identities as the Figure 6.2\nbasis of action and to create story lines. Through the creation\nof settings, roles, and narrative, imagination is used to explore ideas about what follows what, and about how things\nunfold in the world (Deunk, Berenst, & De Glopper, 2008). Perspective taking is improved through this social form of\npretend play. Emotional development also is also fostered by sociodramatic play, as children choose imagined\ninterpretations and responses to imagined emotions in pretend situations, and responds to emotions that arise in actual\nconflict generated between playmates. Perspective taking and dealing with emotions during pretend play contribute to\nthe development of self-regulation (Gioia & Tobin, 2020).\nBenefits of Play\n\u201cPlay in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of the human species,\u201d says Dr. David\nWhitebread from Cambridge University\u2019s Faculty of Education. \u201cIt underpins how we develop as intellectual,\nproblem-solving, emotional adults and is crucial to our success as a highly adaptable species.\u201d International\nbodies like the United Nations and the European Union have begun to develop policies concerned with\nchildren\u2019s right to play, and to consider implications for leisure facilities and educational programs.\nThanks to the Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning (PEDaL) at Cambridge,\nWhitebread, Baker, Gibson and a team of researchers are accumulating evidence on the role played by play\nin how a child develops. \u201cA strong possibility is that play supports the early development of children\u2019s self-\ncontrol,\u201d explains Baker, \u201c. . . our abilities to develop awareness of our own thinking processes.\u201d If playful\nexperiences do facilitate this aspect of development, say the researchers, it could be extremely significant\nfor educational practices because the ability to self-regulate has been shown to be a key predictor of\nacademic performance.\nGibson adds: \u201cPlayful behaviour is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional development.\nIn my previous research, I investigated how observing children at play can give us important clues about\ntheir well-being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.\u201d\nSource: Plays the Thing, Cambridge University https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/plays-the-\nthing is licensed under a CC BY 4.0\nSports and Physical Education\nPlay and Peers | 187 Middle childhood seems to be a great time to introduce\nchildren to organized sports, and in fact, many parents do.\nNearly 3 million children play soccer in the United States\n(United States Youth Soccer, 2012). This activity promises to\nhelp children improve athletically, learn a sense of competition,\nand build social skills. However, it has been suggested that the\nemphasis on competition and athletic skill can be\ncounterproductive and lead children to grow tired of the game\nand want to quit. In many respects, it appears that children\u2019s\nactivities are no longer children\u2019s activities once adults become\ninvolved and approach the games as adults rather than children.\nFigure 6.3. Sports participation in childhood The U. S. Soccer Federation recently advised coaches to reduce\nthe amount of drilling engaged in during practice and to allow\nchildren to play more freely and to choose their own positions. The hope is that this will build on their love of the game\nand foster their natural talents.\nSports are important for children. Children\u2019s participation in sports has been linked to:\n\u2022 Higher levels of satisfaction with family and overall quality of life in children\n\u2022 Improved physical and emotional development\n\u2022 Better academic performance\nYet, a study on children\u2019s sports in the United States (Sabo & Veliz, 2008) has found that gender, poverty, location,\nethnicity, and disability can limit opportunities to engage in sports. Girls were more likely to have never participated\nin any type of sport. They also found that fathers may not be providing their daughters as much support as they do\ntheir sons. While boys rated their fathers as their biggest mentors who taught them the most about sports, girls rated\ncoaches and physical education teachers as their key mentors. Sabo and Veliz also found that children in suburban\nneighborhoods had a much higher participation of sports than boys and girls living in rural or urban centers. In addition,\nCaucasian girls and boys participated in organized sports at higher rates than minority children.\nStudents don\u2019t always persist in their participation in extracurricular and other organized sports activities. Sabo and\nVeliz asked children who had dropped out of organized sports why they left. For both girls and boys, the number one\nanswer was that it was no longer any fun (see Table 6.2). According to the Sport Policy and Research Collaborative\n(SPARC) (2013), almost 1 in 3 children drop out of organized sports, and while there are many factors involved in the\ndecisions to drop out, one suggestion has been the lack of training that coaches of children\u2019s sports receive may be\ncontributing to this attrition (Barnett, Smoll & Smith, 1992). Several studies have found that when coaches receive proper\ntraining, the drop-out rate is about 5% instead of the usual 30% (Fraser-Thomas, C\u00f4t\u00e9, & Deakin, 2005; SPARC, 2013).\n188 | Play and Peers Table 6.2 Top Reasons Dropped Out or Stopped Playing Organized/Team Sports\nGirls Boys\nI was not having fun 38% I was not having fun 39%\nI wanted to focus more on studying and grades 36% I had a health problem or injury 29%\nI had a health problem or injury 27% I wanted to focus more on studying and grades 26%\nI wanted to focus more on other clubs or activities 22% I did not like or get along with the coach 22%\nI did not like or get along with the coach 18% I wanted to focus more on other clubs or activities 18%\nI did not like or get along with others on the team 16% I did not like or get along with others on the team 16%\nI was not a good enough player 15% I was not a good enough player 15%\nMy family worried about me getting hurt or injured while My family worried about me getting hurt or injured while\n14$ 12%\nplaying sports playing sports\nSource: Sabo, D., & Veliz, P.

For many children, physical education in school is a key component in introducing children to\nsports and regular physical activity. After years of schools cutting back on physical education programs, there has\nbeen a turnaround, prompted by concerns over childhood obesity and related health issues. Despite these changes,\ncurrently only the state of Oregon and the District of Columbia meet PE guidelines of a minimum of 150 minutes per\nweek of physical activity in elementary school and 225 minutes in middle school (SPARC, 2016). There is also controversy\nabout physical education. Some experts recommend changing the content of these classes. Training on competitive\nsports, often a high priority, is unlikely to reach the least physically fit youngsters. Instead, programs could emphasize\ncooperation, enjoyable informal games, and individual exercise.\nLearning Objectives: Friendships and Peer Relationships\n\u2022 Identify three research traditions that study children\u2019s relationships with agemates.\n\u2022 Describe differences in boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 friendships.\n\u2022 Describe benefits of friendship. How do friendships differ from peer relationships?\n\u2022 Describe sociometric assessment. Identify the categories of sociometric status and describe how children\nin these categories differ from each other.\nFriendship and Peer Relationships\nFriendships and peer relationships are voluntary associations characterized by some degree of simalarity and affiliation.\nThree research traditions focus on the study of friendship and peer relationships. First, there is the study of friendships,\nwhich are dyadic relationships involving closeness and reciprocity. Second, another tradition studies groups of affiliated\nPlay and Peers | 189 peers. In adolescence, these include cliques and crowd. Third, a separate tradition researches agemate status and\npopularity, a tradition known as sociometrics. Let\u2019s look at each of these separately.\nFriendship\nAs toddlers, children may begin to show a preference for\ncertain playmates (Ross & Lollis, 1989). However, peer\ninteractions at this age often involve more parallel play rather\nthan intentional social interactions (Pettit, Clawson, Dodge, &\nBates, 1996). By age four, many children use the word \u201cfriend\u201d\nwhen referring to certain children and do so with a fair degree\nof stability (Hartup, 1983). However, among young children\n\u201cfriendship\u201d is often based on proximity, such as they live next\ndoor, attend the same school, or it refers to whomever they\nhappen to be playing with at the time (Rubin, 1980).\nFigure 6.4 Friendships take on new importance to one\u2019s feelings of worth,\ncompetence, and attractiveness in middle and late childhood.\nFriendships provide the opportunity for learning social skills, such as how to communicate with others and how to\nnegotiate differences. Children get ideas from one another about how to perform certain tasks, how to gain popularity,\nwhat to wear or say, and how to act. This society of children marks a transition from a life focused on the family to a life\nconcerned with peers. During middle and late childhood, peers play an increasingly important role. For example, peers\nplay a key role in a child\u2019s self-esteem at this age as any parent who has tried to console a rejected child will tell you. No\nmatter how complimentary and encouraging the parent may be, being rejected by friends can only be remedied by\nrenewed acceptance. Children\u2019s conceptualization of what makes someone a \u201cfriend\u201d changes from a more egocentric\nunderstanding to one based on mutual trust and commitment. Both Bigelow (1977) and Selman (1980) believe that these\nchanges are linked to advances in cognitive development.\nBigelow and La Gaipa (1975) outline three stages in children\u2019s conceptualizations of friendship. In stage one, reward-\ncost, friendship focuses on mutual activities. Children in early, middle, and late childhood all emphasize similar interests\nas the main characteristics of a good friend. Stage two, normative expectation focuses on conventional morality; that is,\nthe emphasis is on a friend as someone who is kind and shares with you. Clark and Bittle (1992) found that, compared to\nthird or eighth graders, fifth graders emphasized this more in a friend. In the final stage, empathy and understanding,\nfriends are people who are loyal, committed to the relationship, and share intimate information. Clark and Bittle (1992)\nreported eighth graders emphasized this most in a friend. They also found that as early as fifth grade, girls were starting\nto include sharing of secrets, and not betraying confidences as crucial to someone who is a friend.\nSelman (1980) outlines five stages of friendship from early childhood through to adulthood:\n\u2022 Momentary physical interaction, a friend is someone who you are playing with at this point in time. Selman notes\nthat this is typical of children between the ages of three and six. These early friendships are based more on\ncircumstances (e.g., a neighbor) than on genuine similarities.\n\u2022 One-way assistance, a friend is someone who does nice things for you, such as saving you a seat on the school bus\nor sharing a toy. However, children in this stage, do not always think about what they are contributing to the\nrelationships. Nonetheless, having a friend is important and children will sometimes put up with a not so nice\nfriend, just to have a friend. Children as young as five and as old as nine may be in this stage.\n\u2022 Fair-weather cooperation, children are very concerned with fairness and reciprocity, and thus, a friend is someone\nreturns a favor. In this stage, if a child does something nice for a friend there is an expectation that the friend will\ndo something nice for them at the first available opportunity. When this fails to happen, a child may break off the\n190 | Play and Peers friendship. Selman found that some children as young as seven and as old as twelve are in this stage.\n\u2022 Intimate and mutual sharing, typically between the ages of eight and fifteen, a friend is someone who you can tell\nthem things you would tell no one else. Children and teens in this stage no longer \u201ckeep score\u201d and do things for a\nfriend because they genuinely care for the person. If a friendship dissolves in the stage it is usually due to a\nviolation of trust. However, children in this stage do expect their friend to share similar interests and viewpoints\nand may take it as a betrayal if a friend likes someone that they do not.\n\u2022 Autonomous interdependence, a friend is someone who accepts you and that you accept as they are. In this stage\nchildren, teens, and adults accept and even appreciate differences between themselves and their friends. They are\nalso not as possessive, so they are less likely to feel threatened if their friends have other relationships or interests.\nChildren are typically twelve or older in this stage.\nPeer Groups\nIn addition to their friendships, children also interact with other children their own age, referred to as peers. Peers\ninclude children encountered at school, in the neighborhood, or through family associations. Not all peers are friends.\nSome are acquaintances, and others are non-affiliated, but still part of the social context. Collections of peers that hang\nout or repeatedly engage in joint activities are referred to as peer groups, or cliques.\nSociometrics and Popularity\nSociometric assessment measures social status and acceptance among members of a group, such as a classroom of\nstudents. In sociometric research children are asked to mention the three children they like to play with the most, and\nthose they do not like to play with. The number of times a child is nominated for each of the two categories (like, do not\nlike) is tabulated. Popular children receive many votes in the \u201clike\u201d category, and very few in the \u201cdo not like\u201d category. In\ncontrast, rejected children receive more unfavorable votes, and few favorable ones. Controversial children are mentioned\nfrequently in each category, with several children liking them and several children placing them in the \u201cdo not like\u201d\ncategory. Neglected children are rarely mentioned in either category, and the average child has a few positive votes with\nvery few negative ones (Asher & Hymel, 1981).\nMost children want to be liked and accepted by their friends.\nSome popular children are nice and have good social skills.\nThese popular-prosocial children tend to do well in school and\nare cooperative and friendly. Popular-antisocial children may\ngain popularity by acting tough or spreading rumors about others\n(Cillessen & Mayeux, 2004). Rejected children are sometimes\nexcluded because they are rejected-withdrawn. These children\nare shy and withdrawn and are easy targets for bullies because\nthey are unlikely to retaliate when belittled (Boulton, 1999).\nOther rejected children are rejected-aggressive and are\nostracized because they are aggressive, loud, and confrontational.\nFigure 6.5\nThe aggressive-rejected children may be acting out of a feeling\nof insecurity. Unfortunately, their fear of rejection only leads to behavior that brings further rejection from other\nchildren. Children who are not accepted are more likely to experience conflict, lack confidence, and have trouble\nadjusting (Klima & Repetti, 2008; Schwartz, Lansford, Dodge, Pettit, & Bates, 2014).\nLong-Term Consequences of Popularity. Childhood popularity researcher Mitch Prinstein has found that likability\nin childhood leads to positive outcomes throughout one\u2019s life (as cited in Reid, 2017). Adults who were accepted in\nchildhood have stronger marriages and work relationships, earn more money, and have better health outcomes than\nthose who were unpopular. Further, those who were unpopular as children, experienced greater anxiety, depression,\nPlay and Peers | 191 substance use, obesity, physical health problems and suicide. Prinstein found that a significant consequence of\nunpopularity was that children were denied opportunities to build their social skills and negotiate complex interactions,\nthus contributing to their continued unpopularity. Further, biological effects can occur due to unpopularity, as social\nrejection can activate genes that lead to an inflammatory response.\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 This video gives a brief history and significance of jump rope, particularly for Black girls in the U.S.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

As children continue into elementary school, they\ndevelop the ability to represent ideas and events more flexibly and logically. Their rules of thinking still seem very basic\nby adult standards and usually operate unconsciously, but they allow children to solve problems more systematically\nthan before, and therefore to be successful with many academic tasks. In the concrete operational stage, for example,\na child may unconsciously follow the rule: \u201cIf nothing is added or taken away, then the amount of something stays the\nsame.\u201d This simple principle helps children to understand certain arithmetic tasks, such as in adding or subtracting zero\nfrom a number, as well as to do certain classroom science experiments, such as ones involving judgments of the amounts\nof liquids when mixed. Piaget called this period the concrete operational stage because children mentally \u201coperate\u201d on\nconcrete objects and events.\nConcrete Operational Thought\nFrom ages 7 to 11, children are in what Piaget referred to as the concrete operational stage of cognitive development\n(Crain, 2005). This involves mastering the use of logic in concrete ways. The word concrete refers to that which is tangible;\nthat which can be seen, touched, or experienced directly. The concrete operational child is able to make use of logical\nprinciples in solving problems involving the physical world. For example, the child can understand principles of cause\nand effect, size, and distance.\nThe child can use logic to solve problems tied to their own direct experience, but has trouble solving hypothetical\nproblems or considering more abstract problems. The child uses inductive reasoning, which is a logical process in which\nmultiple premises believed to be true are combined to obtain a specific conclusion. For example, a child has one friend who\nis rude, another friend who is also rude, and the same is true for a third friend. The child may conclude that friends are\nrude. We will see that this way of thinking tends to change during adolescence as deductive reasoning emerges. We will\nnow explore three of the major capacities that the concrete operational child exhibits.\nThought becomes multidimensional. Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object\n(such as the height of the glass) and instead can coordinate multiple dimensions simultaneously (such as the width\nof the glass). (That is, they are no longer limited by centration, which is why this gain is also known by the term\nCognitive Development | 195 \u201cdecentration\u201d). Multidimensionality allows children to take multiple perspectives at the same time, to understand part-\nwhile relationships, and to cross classify objects using multiple features.\nFigure 6.13. Children looking at these glasses demonstrate\nmultidimensional thinking when looking at more than one\nattribute i.e. tall, short, and wide narrow.\n\u2022 Multiple perspectives. Remember our discussion of pre-operational thought\u2013 when young children were asked to\ndescribe the Three Mountain display from the perspective of someone sitting across the table form them? They\ncould only report on the view form one perspective\u2013 their own. With the emergence of connote operations,\nchildren can now understand that people looking from different vantage points, see different features. They can\ncoordinate multiple perspectives. This skill is very useful, and can be practiced, while playing with peers and\nsettling peer disputes.\n\u2022 Part-whole relationships. Think back to preoperational thought, where if you showing a long child a bouquet of\nsix daisies and 3 roses, and asked them whether there were more daisies or flowers, they would typically\nanswer\u201ddaisies\u201d? They could not coordinate the two perspectives of \u201cpart\u201d and \u201cwhole.\u201d Now in middle childhood,\nthese questions seem silly\u2013 of course there are more flowers, flowers include both daisies and roses. At the age,\nthe correct answer is obvious\u2013 it\u2019s a logical necessity.\n\u2022 Classification. As children\u2019s experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schemata and are able to organize objects\nin many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and can arrange objects into a variety of\nclasses and subclasses.\n196 | Cognitive Development Figure 6.7. This child might use classification if she sorts these toys by color.\nThought becomes operational. A second major shift in cognitive development during middle childhood coccus when\nthought becomes operational, by which Piaget meant that it consists of reversible, organized systems of mental\nactions. These systems allow children to mentally undo actions (reversibility) and to understand that certain properties\nof objects (like their number, mass, volume, and so on) remain constant despite transformations in appearance\n(conservation).\n\u2022 Reversibility. The child learns that some things that have\nbeen changed can be returned to their original state. Water\ncan be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again, but\neggs cannot be unscrambled. Arithmetic operations are\nreversible as well: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 \u2013 3 = 2. Many of these\ncognitive skills are incorporated into the school\u2019s\ncurriculum through mathematical problems and in\nworksheets about which situations are reversible or\nirreversible.\n\u2022 Conservation. Remember the example in our last chapter\nof preoperational children thinking that a tall beaker filled Figure 6.11. Understanding that ice cubes melt is an example\nof reversibility.\nwith 8 ounces of water was \u201cmore\u201d than a short, wide bowl\nfilled with 8 ounces of water? Concrete operational\nchildren can understand the concept of conservation which means that changing one quality (in this example,\nheight or water level) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same\namount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.\nCognitive Development | 197 Figure 6.12. Beakers displaying the idea of conservation.\nThought becomes logical. A third major accomplishment of concrete operational development is that thought becomes\nlogical, and children can reason logically about concrete events.\n\u2022 Inferring higher-order characteristics. Where young children\u2019s reasoning was focused on perceptual cues, older\nchildren can now consider a variety of specific cues and from, use the power of inference, to reach a logical\nconclusion about higher-order characteristics. This capacity is seen in children\u2019s understanding of their own and\nother people\u2019s capacities and personalities. For example, after a child does well on multiple multiple assignments\nin math, she may conclude that she is high in math ability.\n\u2022 Identify defining features. Whereas young children\u2019s understanding was dominated by the most perceptually\nsalient features of objects, with concrete operational thought, children in middle childhood focus instead on the\ndefining features of particular objects or states. They are not distracted by the most salient features; they recognize\nthe underlying defining features. For example, young children might think that bicycles and toasters are alive (a\nkind of thought called \u201canimism,\u201d remember?) because they move. By middle childhood, however, children\nunderstand that even though many mechanical devices (e.g., cars, fireworks) and natural objects move (e.g., the\nsun, the tides), only plants and animals have a life force, which is the defining feature of being alive.\n\u2022 Seriation. Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way is now\ndemonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can methodically arrange a series of different-\nsized sticks in order by length. This is a complicated task that requites multidimensional thinking, because each\nobject must be placed so that it is bigger than the one before it, but smaller than the one after it. These capacities\nallow children to make social comparisons as well, estimating who is bigger or better along some attribute or\ncapacity (e.g., spelling ability, soccer skills, drawing). Social comparison plays a role in the shift in children\u2019s\nestimates of their capacities; they change from the rosy overestimates of early childhood (where everyone sees\nthemselves as \u201cgood\u201d at everything regardless of performance) to a more accurate view that corresponds to\nexternal referents (e.g., school grades) during middle childhood.\n198 | Cognitive Development Figure 6.14. Putting these squares from smallest to largest is an example of seriation.\n\u2022 Transitive inference. Being able to understand how objects are related to one another is referred to as transitivity,\nor transitive inference. This means that if one understands that a dog is a mammal, and that a poodle is a dog, then\na poodle must be a mammal.\nFigure 6.15. Transitivity allows children\nto understand that this poodle is a dog\nand a mammal\nLimitations of concrete operational thought. These new cognitive skills increase the child\u2019s understanding of the\nphysical world, however according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think\nin systematic scientific ways. For example, when asked which variables influence the period that a pendulum takes to\ncomplete its arc and given weights they can attach to strings in order to do experiments, most children younger than 12\nperform biased experiments from which no conclusions can be drawn (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).\nCognitive Development | 199 References\nCrain, W.

He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and what is wrong. Just as Piaget believed that\nchildren\u2019s cognitive development follows specific age-graded stages, Kohlberg (1984) argued that we learn our moral\nvalues through active thinking and reasoning, and that moral development follows a series of qualitatively different\nstages. Kohlberg\u2019s six stages are generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development,\nKohlberg posed moral dilemmas to children, teenagers, and adults, such as the following:\nA man\u2019s wife is dying of cancer and there is only one drug that can save her. The only place to get the drug is at the store\nof a pharmacist who is known to overcharge people for drugs. The man can only pay $1,000, but the pharmacist wants\n$2,000, and refuses to sell it to him for less, or to let him pay later. Desperate, the man later breaks into the pharmacy and\nsteals the medicine. Should he have done that? Was it right or wrong? Why? (Kohlberg, 1984)\nLevel 1. Preconventional Morality. Reasoning during Level one, which is broken into two stages, is based on what would\nhappen to the man as a result of the act, that is, on the consequences of the act. In Stage 1, moral reasoning is based\non concepts of punishment. The child believes that if the consequence for an action is punishment, then the action was\nwrong. For example, they might say the man should not break into the pharmacy because the pharmacist might find\nhim and beat him. In Stage 2, the child bases his or her thinking on self-interest and reward. \u201cYou scratch my back,\nI\u2019ll scratch yours.\u201d They might say that the man should break in and steal the drug and his wife will give him a big\nkiss. Right or wrong, both decisions were based on what would physically happen to the man as a result of the act.\nThis is a self-centered approach to moral decision-making. He called this most superficial understanding of right and\nwrong preconventional morality. Preconventional morality focuses on self-interest. Punishment is avoided, and rewards\nare sought. Adults can also fall into these stages, particularly when they are under pressure.\nLevel 2. Conventional Morality. Those tested who based their answers on authority, that is, based on what other people\nwould think of the man as a result of his act, were placed in Level Two. For instance, they might say he should break\ninto the store, and then everyone would think he was a good husband, or he should not because it is against the law. In\nMoral Development | 201 either case, right and wrong is determined by what other people think. In Stage 3, the person reasons based on mutual\nexpectations and relationships. They want to please others. At Stage 4, the person acknowledges the importance of social\nnorms or laws and wants to be a good member of the group or society. A good decision is one that gains the approval\nof others or one that complies with the law. This he called conventional morality, people care about the effect of their\nactions on others. Some older children, adolescents, and adults use this reasoning.\nLevel 3. Postconventional Morality. Right and wrong are based on social contracts established for the good of everyone\nand that can transcend the self and social convention. For example, the man should break into the store because, even\nif it is against the law, the wife needs the drug and her life is more important than the consequences the man might\nface for breaking the law. Alternatively, the man should not violate the principle of the right of property because this\nrule is essential for social order. In either case, the person\u2019s judgment goes beyond what happens to the self. It is based\non a concern for others; for society as a whole, or for an ethical standard rather than a legal standard. This level is\ncalled postconventional moral development because it goes beyond convention or what other people think to a higher,\nuniversal ethical principle of conduct that may or may not be reflected in the law. Notice that such thinking is the kind\nSupreme Court justices do all day when deliberating whether a law is moral or ethical, which requires being able to\nthink abstractly. Often this is not accomplished until a person reaches adolescence or adulthood. In the Stage 5, laws\nare recognized as social contracts. The reasons for the laws, like justice, equality, and dignity, are used to evaluate\ndecisions and interpret laws. In the Stage 6, individually determined universal ethical principles are weighed to make\nmoral decisions. Kohlberg said that few people ever reach this stage. The six stages can be reviewed in Table 6.3.\nTable 6.3: Lawrence Kohlberg\u2019s Levels of Moral Reasoning\nMoral Level Age Description\nStage 1: Focus is on self-interest and punishment is avoided.

The man should\nsteal the drug because life is more important than property.\nAdapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019.\nInfluences on Moral Development\nWhat influences moral development? Kohlberg argued that moral development was not an automatic, maturational\nprocess, nor was it mechanistic, in that moral development couldn\u2019t simply be taught (Crain, 1985). Instead, he proposed\nthat it develops through repeated practice in situations where children must think together with adults or peers about\nmoral problems: where their viewpoints are challenged or questioned; where they have to consider others\u2019 perspectives\nand perhaps revise their own; and where they must try to coordinate their own desires and those of others with the\nhelp of moral rules. Moreover, it is our active engagement with these thought processes that helps our development\n(Berkowitz & Gibbs, 1983). This engagement can occur in many contexts; three notable ones are our caregivers, our\nschooling, and our peers (Berk, 2014, p. 326).\n202 | Moral Development Studies suggest that caregivers\u2019 use of an authoritative parenting style helps children reach higher stages of moral\nreasoning (Pratt, Skoe, & Arnold, 2010). This style emphasizes care, consistent and fair expectations, and support for\nautonomy in ways such as discussing the reasoning for rules and encouraging children\u2019s own perspectives. These\naspects of parenting can help children practice their own moral reasoning, allow them to internalize true moral\nprinciples, and over time to act on them under conditions of greater difficulty (aka temptation). On the other hand, use\nof threats and lectures do not help moral reasoning (Walker & Taylor, 1991). Studies suggest that children remember the\nnegative affect and exertion of force, which interferes with the internalization of moral principles\nEducation is another important venue for practicing moral reasoning. In general, the more years individuals dedicate to\nschooling, the higher their average level of moral reasoning (Dawson, 2002). In particular, schools help promote moral\nreasoning when they offer students exposure to diverse experiences and ways of being, role-taking and perspective-\ntaking opportunities, and chances to discuss and defend their own viewpoints (Comunian & Gielen, 2006; Mason &\nGibbs, 1993).\nWithin schools and outside of them, peers are important relational partners for developing moral reasoning. As opposed\nto conversations with parents or teachers, which are hierarchical, peers are on more-equal footing. With peers,\nindividuals need to practice communicating their own needs and considering the needs of their friends to reach\ndecisions and resolve conflicts (Killen & Nucci, 1995).\nCritiques. Although research has supported Kohlberg\u2019s idea that moral reasoning changes from an early emphasis\non punishment and social rules and regulations to an emphasis on more general ethical principles, as with Piaget\u2019s\napproach, Kohlberg\u2019s stage model is probably too simple. For one, people may use higher levels of reasoning for some\ntypes of problems but revert to lower levels in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs\n(Rest, 1979). Second, it has been argued that the stage model is particularly appropriate for Western, rather than non-\nWestern, samples in which allegiance to social norms, such as respect for authority, may be particularly important\n(Haidt, 2001). In addition, there is frequently little correlation between how we score on the moral stages and how we\nbehave in real life.\nPerhaps the most important critique of Kohlberg\u2019s theory is that it emphasizes justice without incorporating compassion\nand other moral considerations, and in doing so might describe the moral development of males better than it describes\nthat of females (who were not represented in Kohlberg\u2019s initial research). Gilligan (1982) has argued that, because of\ndifferences in their socialization, males tend to value principles of justice and rights, whereas females value caring\nfor and helping others. She argued for an \u201cethic of care,\u201d emphasizing our human responsibilities to one another\nand consideration for others. Although there is little evidence for a gender difference in Kohlberg\u2019s stages of moral\ndevelopment (Turiel, 1998), there is some evidence that girls and women tend to focus more on issues of caring, helping,\nand connecting with others than do boys and men (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000). Despite these trends in the relative priorities\nof caring and justice, evidence suggests that people of all genders consider both justice and caring to some extent in\ntheir moral decisions (Berk, 2014; Walker, 1995).\nDevelopment of an internal moral compass as a prerequisite for social activism. Researchers have become\nincreasingly interested in the childhood antecedents of adolescent and adult action on behalf of social and racial justice\n(Killen, Rutland, & Yip, 2016). These are complex cognitive, social, and motivational processes, that likely are shaped by\na host of specific experiences, such as family participation in civil engagement activities (e.g., volunteering and protest\nmovements). However, an important prerequisite would include the development of a strong moral compass during\nearly and middle childhood. Internalization of moral principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability would be useful\nfor helping adolescents and young adults recognize inequities and feel morally responsible for doing their part to see\njustice done. This will be an interesting area for further study (Killen et al., 2016).\nMoral Development | 203 References\nBerkowitz, M., & Gibbs, J. (1983).

The empirical picture is not complete, but it seems that gender\nidentities are complex internalized cognitive and emotional representations that children and youth construct for\nthemselves over time, based on the biological and temperamental givens that each one comes with and their cumulative\ninteractions with the social worlds of family, school, peers, and society. Much of gender development seems to reflect\ncognitive changes that allow children to successively realize and try to make sense of different aspects of gender\nidentity, but the whole kit-n-caboodle seems to be built on a foundation created by biological or neurophysiological\ngivens. We will trace the main age-graded milestones that children experience in constructing their own gender\nidentities, in order to suggest ways in which parents (and other adults) can support children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 healthy\ndevelopment.\nGender development is a fascinating process because it is deeply rooted in biology, profoundly shaped by societal\nexpectations, and actively constructed by individuals over and over again at different developmental levels. All theories\nof gender identity posit that the processes shaping its development are both biological and societal, so it is important\nto get straight on those biological and social processes before we turn to development. This is also a fascinating\nhistorical moment to study gender development because science is revealing more and more about its biological and\npsychological complexity, just as society is undergoing a gender revolution in which people are questioning, exploring,\nand recognizing a much broader spectrum of gender and sexual identities.\nBiopsychosocial Processes of Gender\n206 | Gender Development The terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, although they have different meanings. In this context, sex\nrefers to biological categories (traditionally, either male or female) as defined by physical differences in genetic composition\nand in reproductive anatomy and function. On the other hand, gender refers to the cultural, social, and psychological\nmeanings that are associated with particular biopsychosocial categories, like masculinity and femininity (Wood & Eagly,\n2002), which vary depending on other intersectional factors, like race, ethnicity, and culture.\nHistorically, the terms gender and sex have been used interchangeably. Because of this, gender is often viewed as a\nbinary \u2013 a person is either male or female \u2013 and it is assumed that a person\u2019s gender matches their biological sex.\nHowever, recent research challenges both of those assumptions. Although most people identify with the gender that\nmatches their natal sex (cisgender), some of the population (estimates range from 0.6 to 3 percent) identify with a\ngender that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth (transgender; Flores, Herman, Gates, & Brown, 2016;\nsee box). For example, an individual assigned as male based on biological characteristics may identify as female, or vice\nversa. Researchers have also been increasingly examining the long-held assumption that biological sex is binary (e.g.,\nCarothers & Reis, 2013; Hyde, Bigler, Joel, Tate, & van Anders, 2019). Although it has always been clear that there are more\nthan two biological sexes, for example individuals who are intersex (see box), more recently scientists have identified\ndozens of markers of sexuality outside of the reproductive system (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, hormonal, endocrine,\nneurophysiological, psychological, social). People have a range of different combinations of these characteristics,\nsuggesting that biological sex is more complex and multifaceted than a binary category.\nBeyond the Binary in Biological Sex\nSome individuals are intersex or sex diverse; that is born with either an absence or some combination of male\nand female reproductive organs, sex hormones, or sex chromosomes (Jarne & Auld, 2006). In humans, intersex\nindividuals make up a small but significant proportion of world\u2019s population; with recent estimates ranging\nbetween .05 and 2 percent (Blackless et al., 2000). There are dozens of intersex conditions, and intersex\nindividuals demonstrate some of the diverse variations of biological sex. Some examples of intersex\nconditions include:\n\u2022 Turner syndrome or the absence of, or an imperfect, second X chromosome\n\u2022 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia or a genetic disorder caused by an increased production of androgens\n\u2022 Androgen insensitivity syndrome or when a person has one X and one Y chromosome, but is resistant to the\nmale hormones or androgens\nGreater attention to the rights of children born intersex is occurring in the medical field, and intersex\nchildren and their parents should work closely with specialists to ensure these children develop positive\ngender identities.\nResearch has also begun to conceptualize gender in ways beyond the gender binary. Genderqueer or gender nonbinary\nare umbrella terms used to describe a wide range of individuals who do not identify with and/or conform to the gender\nbinary. These terms encompass a variety of more specific terms that individuals may use to describe themselves. Some\ncommon terms are genderfluid, agender, and bigender. An individual who is genderfluid may identify as male, female,\nboth, or neither at different times and in different circumstances. An individual who is agender may have no gender or\ndescribe themselves as having a neutral gender, while bigender individuals identify as two genders.\nIt is important to remember that sex and gender do not always match and that gender is not always binary; however,\na large majority of prior research examining gender has not made these distinctions. As such, many of the following\nGender Development | 207 sections will discuss gender as a binary. Throughout, we will consider the development of \u201cgender-nonconforming\u201d\nchildren. This is a broad and heterogeneous group of children and adults whose gender development does not fit within\nsocietal dictates. Because societal expectations are so narrow, there are many ways not to conform, and we mention\na few here, just to give a flavor of these alternative pathways. All of them are healthy and positive, but children and\nadolescents who follow these pathways need social validation and protection from gender discrimination and bullying.\nActivists are leading global movements that will push society to reinvent its views of the wide variety of sexualities and\ngender identities that have always been with us.\nTransgender Children\nMany young children do not conform to the gender roles modeled by the culture and push back against\nassigned roles. However, a small percentage of children actively reject the toys, clothing, and anatomy of\ntheir assigned sex and state they prefer the toys, clothing, and anatomy of the opposite sex. A recent study\nsuggests that approximately three percent of youth identify as transgender or identifying with a gender\ndifferent from their natal sex (Rider, McMorris, Gower, Coleman, & Eisenberg, 2018). Many transgender\nadults report that they identified with the opposite gender as soon as they began talking (Russo, 2016).\nSome of these children may experience gender dysphoria, or distress accompanying a mismatch between\none\u2019s gender identity and biological sex (APA, 2013), while other children do not experience discomfort\nregarding their gender identity.\nAs they grow up, some transgender individuals alter their bodies through medical interventions, such as\nsurgery and hormonal therapy, so that their physical being is better aligned with their gender identity.\nHowever, not all transgender individuals choose to alter their bodies or physically transition. Many maintain\ntheir original anatomy but present themselves to society as a different gender, often by adopting the dress,\nhairstyle, mannerisms, or other characteristics typically assigned to a certain gender. It is important to note\nthat people who cross-dress, or wear clothing that is traditionally assigned to the opposite gender, such as\ntransvestites, drag kings, and drag queens, do not necessarily identify as transgender (although some do).\nPeople often confuse the term transvestite, which is the practice of dressing and acting in a style or manner\ntraditionally associated with another sex (APA, 2013) with transgender. Cross-dressing is typically a form of\nself-expression, entertainment, or personal style, and not necessarily an expression of one\u2019s gender identity.\nSexual Orientation\nA person\u2019s sexual orientation is their emotional and sexual attraction to a particular gender. It is a personal\nquality that inclines people to feel romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of a\ngiven sex or gender. According to the American Psychological Association (APA) (2016), sexual orientation\nalso refers to a person\u2019s sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a\ncommunity of others who share those attractions. Sexual orientation is independent of gender; for example,\na transgender person may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, asexual, or\nany other kind of sexuality, just like a cisgender person.\nSexual Orientation on a Continuum. Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey was among the first to\nconceptualize sexuality as a continuum rather than a strict dichotomy of gay or straight. To classify this\n208 | Gender Development continuum of heterosexuality and homosexuality, Kinsey et al. (1948) created a seven-point rating scale that\nranged from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. Research conducted over several decades\nhas supported this idea that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the\nopposite sex/gender to exclusive attraction to the same sex/gender (Carroll, 2016).\nHowever, sexual orientation can be defined in many ways. Heterosexuality, which is often referred to as\nbeing straight, is attraction to individuals of the opposite sex/gender, while homosexuality, being gay or\nlesbian, is attraction to individuals of one\u2019s own sex/gender. Bisexuality was a term traditionally used to refer\nto attraction to individuals of either male or female sex, but it has recently been used in nonbinary models of\nsex and gender (i.e., models that do not assume there are only two sexes or two genders) to refer to\nattraction to any sex or gender. Alternative terms such as pansexuality and polysexuality have also been\ndeveloped, referring to attraction to all sexes/genders and attraction to multiple sexes/genders, respectively\n(Carroll, 2016).\nAsexuality refers to having no sexual attraction to any sex/gender. According to Bogaert (2015) about one\npercent of the population is asexual. Being asexual is not due to any physical problems, and the lack of\ninterest in sex does not necessarily cause the individual any distress. Asexuality is being researched as a\ndistinct sexual orientation.\nSocietal Expectations about Gender: Gender Roles and Stereotypes\nChildren develop within cultures that have a \u201cgender curriculum\u201d that prescribes what it means to be male and female.\nThese include gender roles and gender stereotypes. Gender roles are the expectations associated with being male or\nfemale. Children learn at a young age that there are distinct behaviors and activities deemed to be appropriate for boys\nand for girls. These roles are acquired through socialization, a process through which children learn to behave in a\nparticular way as dictated by societal values, beliefs, and attitudes. Gender stereotyping goes one step further: it involves\novergeneralizing about the attitudes, traits, or behavior patterns of women or men. For boys and men, expectations\nand stereotypes include characteristics like \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cbrave\u201d or \u201cassertive\u201d, and for girls and women characteristics\nlike \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cnurturing\u201d and \u201caffectionate.\u201d You might be saying to yourself, \u201cbut I can be most of those things,\nsometimes\u201d\u2014and you are right. People of all genders frequently enact roles that are stereotypically assigned to only men\nor women.\nPsychological androgyny. One area of research on gender expectations has examined differences between people who\nidentify with typically masculine or feminine gender roles. Researchers gave men and women lists of positive masculine\ntraits (emphasizing agency and assertiveness) and feminine traits (emphasizing gentleness, compassion, and awareness\nof others\u2019 feelings), and asked them to rate the extent to which those traits applied to them. Some people reported\nidentifying highly with mostly masculine traits or identifying highly with mostly feminine traits, but some people did\nnot identify strongly with either (this group was called \u201cundifferentiated\u201d), and a final group identified strongly with\nboth masculine and feminine traits; this last group was called \u201candrogynous\u201d (Bem, 1977). Psychological androgyny is\nwhen people display both traditionally male and female gender role characteristics \u2013 people who are both strong and\nemotionally expressive, both caring and confident.\nWhich group reported the best psychological functioning? On the one hand, those with more \u201cmasculine\u201d traits (the\nmasculine and androgynous groups) tend to have higher self-esteem and lower internalizing symptoms (Boldizar, 1991;\nDiDonato & Berenbaum 2011). (This may be because \u201cmasculine\u201d traits like being self-reliant, self-assured, and assertive\nare closely related to these outcomes.) On the other hand, there is a cost to missing out on \u201cfeminine\u201d traits as well,\nsince things like relationships, emotions, and communication are central to human well-being. In general, studies find\nGender Development | 209 that psychologically androgynous people, who report high levels of both male and female characteristics are more\nadaptable and flexible (Huyck, 1996; Taylor & Hall, 1982), and seem to fare better in general, when considering many\nareas of adjustment (compared to those with masculine or feminine traits alone; Pauletti, et al. 2017). It may be no\nsurprise that, in general, it is most adaptive to be able to draw on the whole spectrum of human traits (Berk, 2014).\nProcesses of Gender Development\nFour major psychological theories highlight multiple explanatory processes through which children develop gender\nidentities. Most of these theories focus ongender typing, which depicts the processes through which children become\naware of their gender, and adopt the values, attributes, objects, and activities of members of the gender they identify as their\nown.\n1. A primary perspective on gender development is provided by social learning theory. Consistent with mechanistic\nmeta-theories, this theory argues that behavior is learned through observation, modeling, reinforcement, and\npunishment (Bandura, 1997). Each society has its own \u201cgender curriculum,\u201d which leads to differential expectations\nand treatment starting at birth. Children are rewarded and reinforced for behaving in concordance with gender\nroles and punished for breaking gender roles. Social learning theory also posits that children learn many of their\ngender roles by observing and modeling the behavior of older children and adults, and in doing so, learn the\nbehaviors that are appropriate for each gender. In this process, fathers seem to play a particularly important role.\n2. A second perspective, consistent with maturational meta-theories, focuses on biological and neurophysiological\nfactors that are present at birth. This theory underscores the idea, present in research on gender expression,\nsexual orientation, and gender identity, that children come with a firm biological foundation for their gender and\nsexual preferences; these include genes, chromosomes, and hormones (Roselli, 2018). Like temperament, infants\nseem to come with \u201cgender stuff\u201d that, depending how well it matches current social categories, can influence how\nthey respond to expectations and pressures for conformity.\n3. A third perspective, consistent with organismic meta-theories, focuses on cognitive developmental theory. This\napproach holds that children\u2019s understanding about gender and its meaning depend completely on their current\nstage of cognitive development. At birth, children have no idea that gender as a category even exists or that they\nmay belong to one of them. As their developmental capacities grow, toddlers and then young children can\nsuccessively represent and understand more and more complex aspects of gender-related identity. These\ncognitive stages provide some of the clearest age-graded milestones in the development of gender identity, such\nas the emergence of gender awareness (i.e., the recognition of one\u2019s own gender) and gender constancy (i.e., the\nbelief that gender is a fixed characteristic), which are described in more detail below.\n4. A fourth major theory, which emphasizes the active role of the child in constructing a gender identity, is called\ngender schema theory. Consistent with contextualist meta-theories, gender schema theory argues that children\nare active learners who essentially socialize themselves. In this case, children actively organize the behavior,\nactivities, and attributes they observe into gender categories, which are known as schemas. These schemas then\naffect what children notice and remember later. People of all ages are more likely to remember schema-consistent\nbehaviors and attributes than those that are schema-inconsistent. So, when they think of firefighters, people are\nmore likely to remember men, and forget women. They also misremember schema-inconsistent information. If\nresearch participants are shown pictures of someone standing at the stove, they are more likely to remember the\nperson to be cooking if depicted as a woman, and the person to be repairing the stove if depicted as a man. By\nremembering only schema-consistent information, gender schemas are strengthened over time.\nAll four processes highlighted in these theories play a role in gender development, which can be considered a\nbiopsychosocial process: (1) as depicted by social learning theory, it is shaped by the society\u2019s gender curriculum,\nthrough processes of observation, modeling, reinforcement, and punishment; (2) as depicted by biological theories, it\nis built on a strong neurophysiological foundation of preferences in gender expression, sexual orientation, and gender\n210 | Gender Development identity; (3) as explained by cognitive developmental theory, children\u2019s understanding of gender shifts regularly as the\ncomplexity of their cognition grows; and (4) as explained by gender schema theory, a child\u2019s gender identity is a work in\nprogress, actively constructed through their own efforts and engagement with their social worlds.\nMost recently, researchers have drawn on broader more integrative dynamic systems approaches to understand the\ndevelopment of gender identity (e.g., Fausto-Sterling, 2012; Martin & Ruble, 2010). These approaches attempt to explain\nhow complex patterns of gender-related thought, behavior, and experience undergo qualitative shifts, including disruption,\ntransformation, and reorganization, during different developmental windows. Researchers argue that \u201cchildren\u2019s\nongoing physical interactions and psychological experiences with parents, peers, and culture fundamentally shape and\nreshape their experience of gender developmentally, as different brain and body systems couple and uncouple over\ntime\u2026 In the end, gender is not a stable achievement, but rather \u2018a pattern in time\u2019 (Fausto-Sterling, 2012, p. 405)\ncontinually building on prior dynamics and adapting to current environments\u201d (Diamond, p. 113).\nAge-graded Milestones in Gender Development\n1. Intrinsic gender and temperament. Research seems to suggest that newborns come with a neurophysiological\npackage of \u201cgender stuff\u201d that provides an internal anchor for their preferences\u2014including (at least) gender identity\nand sexual orientation, and perhaps temperamental characteristics, such as activity level, aggression, effortful control,\nand emotional reactivity. These internal anchors and expressive preferences seem to be part of an individual\u2019s core\nidentity. Scientists are not exactly sure what determines these intrinsic anchors; so far evidence suggests both genetic\ninfluences (e.g., as seen in twin studies, which find that sexual orientation and sexual non-conformity run in families;\nVan Beijsterveldt, Hudziak, & Boomsma, 2006) and the influence of the prenatal environment (e.g., maternal levels of\nandrogens, antibodies to male hormones; Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, & Berenbaum, 2005).\nAlthough each individual\u2019s core identity likely exhibits some degree of malleability, which may make it easier for\nchildren to conform to society\u2019s dictates, LGBTQ+ advocates and parents of gender-expansive children are rock-solid\non one thing: These core identities are often clear to children and they cannot be ignored, subverted, or transformed\nthrough external pressures (Besser et al., 2006). Moreover, it violates children\u2019s rights as humans, when parents or other\nmembers of society attempt to do so.\nDevelopment of Sexual Orientation\nAccording to current scientific understanding, individuals are usually aware of their sexual orientation\nbetween middle childhood and early adolescence. However, this is not always the case, and some do not\nbecome aware of their sexual orientation until much later in life. It is not necessary to participate in sexual\nactivity to be aware of these emotional, romantic, and physical attractions; people can be celibate and still\nrecognize their sexual orientation. Some researchers argue that sexual orientation is not static and inborn\nbut is instead fluid and changeable throughout the lifespan.\nThere is no scientific consensus regarding the exact reasons why an individual holds a particular sexual\norientation. Research has examined possible biological, developmental, social, and cultural influences on\nsexual orientation, but there has been no evidence that links sexual orientation to only one factor (APA,\n2016). However, evidence for biological explanations, including genetics, birth order, and hormones, will be\nsummarized since many scientists argue that biological processes occurring during the embryonic and and\nearly postnatal life play the central organizing role in sexual orientation (Balthazart, 2018).\nGenetics. Using both twin and familial studies, heredity provides one biological explanation for same-sex\norientation. Bailey and Pillard (1991) studied pairs of male twins and found that the concordance rate for\nGender Development | 211 identical twins was 52%, while the rate for fraternal twins was only 22%. Bailey, Pillard, Neale, and Agyei\n(1993) studied female twins and found a similar difference with a concordance rate of 48% for identical\ntwins and 16% for fraternal twins. Schwartz, Kim, Kolundzija, Rieger, & Sanders (2010) found that gay men\nhad more gay male relatives than straight men, and sisters of gay men were more likely to be lesbians than\nsisters of straight men.\nFraternal Birth Order. The fraternal birth order effect indicates that the probability of a boy identifying as\ngay increases for each older brother born to the same mother (Balthazart, 2018; Blanchard, 2001). According to\nBogaret et al. \u201cthe increased incidence of homosexuality in males with older brothers results from a\nprogressive immunization of the mother against a male specific cell-adhesion protein that plays a key role\nin cell-cell interactions, specifically in the process of synapse formation,\u201d (as cited in Balthazart, 2018, p.\n234). A meta-analysis indicated that the fraternal birth order effect explains the sexual orientation of\nbetween 15% and 29% of gay men.\nHormones. Excess or deficient exposure to hormones during prenatal development has also been theorized\nas an explanation for sexual orientation. One-third of females exposed to abnormal amounts of prenatal\nandrogens, a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), identify as bisexual or lesbian (Cohen-\nBendahan, van de Beek, & Berenbaum, 2005). In contrast, too little exposure to prenatal androgens may\naffect male sexual orientation by not masculinizing the male brain (Carlson, 2011).\n2. Gender awareness. At about age 2-3, toddlers\u2019 cognitive development allows them to begin to create representational\ncategories to organize their conceptual thinking about the world. Gender is one of these categories. The ability to\nclassify oneself as male or female is called \u201cgender awareness.\u201d Children\u2019s biological and sexual profiles are built during\nconception and prenatal development, so they are typically assigned a biological sex at birth, but before toddlers\ndevelop the cognitive capacity to categorize, they are blissfully unaware of their gender. Although they have likely been\nreceiving differential treatment from family members since they were born, it is not until they are able to recognize this\ncategory and apply it to themselves, that gender becomes psychologically real. Once small children become aware of\ngender categories, they begin taking notes about the differences between people in these two categories: names, colors,\ntoys, jewelry, clothes, hair length, voices, behavior, and so on.\nBaby X. It is important to note that, in a world without a gender curriculum, the list children would make of\nthe differences between males and females would be very short: It would include only secondary sexual\ncharacteristics of adults and adolescents who are post-puberty. Babies and pre-pubescent children would\nnot be distinguishable by gender\u2013 because they have no secondary sexual characteristics. We can imagine a\nthought experiment in which no one is subject to a gender curriculum. Imagine that each of us receives an\nenvelope at birth with information about our biologically assigned sex inside, but we are not allowed to\nopen it until it becomes relevant, that is, until we reach puberty. In this thought experiment, our parents\nand society would have to raise us so we would be ready to take on either gender role. They would have to\nselect gender-neutral names, colors for the nursery and our clothes, toys, and so on. Many students find\nthis idea intriguing but also a bit unsettling.\nA similar thought experiment was described in an article in 1972 in Ms. Magazine entitled \u201cThe Story of X,\u201d\nwhich describes parents who decided to raise their child without revealing its gender to the world (Gould,\n212 | Gender Development 1972). Several real parents, in Europe and the US, have also decided to raise their children without revealing\ntheir gender. It is fascinating to see how this kind of decision has been received by the media and by other\nparents. In each case, the firestorm of media attention was so dramatic that parents decided to withdraw\ntheir stories (and their children) from scrutiny by the press. Although developmentalists (and parents) can\nargue about the decision to shield children from society\u2019s stereotypes as opposed to helping them\nrecognize, counter, and transcend these stereotypes, the hysteria surrounding decisions to conceal a child\u2019s\ngender are very telling about society\u2019s view of the centrality of gender to every child\u2019s identity, and society\u2019s\n\u201cright to know.\u201d\nGender malleability. When \u201cgender awareness\u201d emerges during early childhood, a key part of the gender schema young\nchildren construct includes the notion that any gender categories that they observe are malleable. Because small\nchildren in the preoperational stage of cognitive development are not capable of inferring the essential underlying\ncharacteristics of gender (just as they cannot infer the defining characteristics of other categories, like animate objects),\nthey see gender assignments as temporary and changeable. Most young children believe that a person can change from\nfemale to male (or vice versa) by cutting their hair or changing their clothes. Little boys often report that they will grow\nup to be Moms with babies in their tummies; little girls that they will grow up to be Dads. Many adults can remember this\nstate of awareness. For example, one of our students told us about her preschool class in which all the 4-year-olds were\nboys; she thought that when she turned 4, she would also become a boy. She was looking forward to the transformation,\nthe same way children look forward to getting taller or older or better at riding a bike.\nBecause many children discuss their desires (and plans) to cross gender lines, parents of gender-non-conforming or\ntransgender children often see these kinds of declarations as a \u201cphase\u201d that children will get over. Parents cannot easily\ntell when children\u2019s statements reflect real underlying convictions that they do not internally identify with the gender\nroles or expressions that have been assigned to them. However, some gender variant or transgender adults report that\ntheir real gender identity was already very clear to them at this age, and parents of such children also confirm that their\nchildren were letting them know through word and deed. In fact, the clarity and insistence on a gender variant identity\nat such a young age (and in the face of such enormous pressure to conform) provides some of the most convincing\nevidence that children come pre-loaded with their own gender and sexual orientation. At the same time, this narrative\ndoes not describe the only pathway. Some gender variant adults report that it was not until they were much older (and\nsometimes with the aid of therapeutic support) that they were able to understand what was/is happening to them in\nterms of gender identity and development.\nGender expression. The specific gender differences that show up in a child\u2019s gender schema at this age depend on the\nlocal social context that the child experiences, which is why many parents decide to minimize young children\u2019s exposure\nto gender-stereotypes . At the same time, for parents who do expect their children to conform to cultural prescriptions\nfor gender-typical dress, toys, and activities, this is the age at which some parents of gender non-conforming or gender-\nvariant children may begin to notice that their child has not gotten the cultural memo. Parents report unease about their\nboys\u2019 exploration of female-stereotyped clothes (such as dresses, tutus, tiaras), accessories (such as high heels, purses,\nbarrettes), toys (especially dolls and doll clothes), and colors\u2014which is why these children have sometimes been dubbed\n\u201cpink boys.\u201d\nNote that there has been no parallel study of \u201cblue girls,\u201d because tomboys do not as frequently alarm their parents at\nthis age. Girls who play with masculine toys often do not face the same ridicule from adults or peers that boys face\nwhen they want to play with feminine toys (Leaper, 2015). Girls also face less ridicule when playing a masculine role (like\ndoctor) as opposed to a boy who wants to take a feminine role (like caregiver). For an interesting segment on CNN, see\n\u201cWhy girls can be boyish but boys can\u2019t be girlish.\u201d As explained by Padawer (2012), \u201cThat\u2019s because girls gain status by\nGender Development | 213 moving into \u201cboy\u201d space, while boys are tainted by the slightest whiff of femininity. \u2018There\u2019s a lot more privilege to being\na man in our society,\u2019 says Diane Ehrensaft, a psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who supports\nallowing children to be what she calls gender creative. \u2018When a boy wants to act like a girl, it subconsciously shakes our\nfoundation, because why would someone want to be the lesser gender?\u2019 Boys are up to seven times as likely as girls to\nbe referred to gender clinics for psychological evaluations. Sometimes the boys\u2019 violation is as mild as wanting a Barbie\nfor Christmas. By comparison, most girls referred to gender clinics are far more extreme in their atypicality: they want\nboy names, boy pronouns and, sometimes, boy bodies.\u201d\nCreation of a \u201cmiddle space.\u201d One surprisingly simple rule for parents who wish to encourage gender\nexploration and expansion is that \u201cColors are just colors, clothes are just clothes, and toys are just toys,\u201d\nmeaning that these societal prescriptions are not developmentally real or meaningful. Researchers refer to\nthe overlap between male and female expectations and stereotypes as \u201cthe middle space,\u201d and suggest that\nan important role for adults to take on is the expansion of this \u201cmiddle space.\u201d With the sanctioning of the\n\u201ctomboy\u201d identity, society has begun to allow girls to take up residence in this middle space. Its expansion\nfor girls and its creation for boys are next steps for all of us. In general, the wider the gender expression\nenjoyed by children of all genders (e.g., girls in sports, boys in cooking, and so on), the healthier everyone\u2019s\ngender identity development is likely to be.\n3. Gender constancy. When children reach the concrete operational stage of cognitive development (between ages\n5 and 7), they are able to infer that, according to societal dictates, the essential defining feature of maleness and\nfemaleness is, traditionally, based on genitalia. This is also the age at which children are able to infer the inverse\nprinciple: If genitalia dictate gender, then all males by necessity have penises and all females have vaginas\u2013which they\nare often happy to announce at Kindergarten or in other public places. Following from this discovery, children also begin\nto grasp the fact that their assignment into gender categories is permanent, unchangeable, or constant.\nThe realization that one is a life-time member of the \u201cboys club\u201d or the \u201cgirls club\u201d typically leads to greater interest and\nmore focus on the membership requirements for their particular club. In stereotyped social contexts, children\u2019s attitude\ntoward conformity to \u201cgender-appropriate\u201d markers may shift from descriptive to prescriptive, in which children so\nhighly identify with markers from their own club, that they begin to denigrate or become repelled by markers of the\n\u201cwrong\u201d club. These behaviors become visible in boy\u2019s resistance to being asked to wear \u201cgirl colors\u201d or play \u201cgirl games.\u201d\nIt is also noticeable in children\u2019s attempts to enforce these categories on others\u2014either directly through instructions\n(\u201cyou have to ride a girl\u2019s bike\u201d) and statements of fact (\u201cthis slide is only for boys,\u201d), or indirectly through teasing,\ntaunting, criticism, and ridicule towards any child who crosses the lines.\nFor gender-nonconforming children or transgender children, this is an age where the psychological costs of society\u2019s\ngender boxes and lines can become apparent. At this age, children can start to sense (or clearly know) that they have\nbeen permanently assigned to a biological sex that comes with a narrow gender expression or an eventually gendered-\nbody whose physicality is not consonant with their own internal needs or identity. If so, then confusion or (more or\nless strong) feelings of gender dissonance may emerge. In the clinical literature, these feelings are sometimes labeled\n\u201cgender dysphoria\u201d to indicate the sadness and desperation that children may feel when they realize that they have been\npermanently assigned to the \u201cwrong\u201d gender expression, gender identity, and/or biological sex.\n214 | Gender Development The dangers of pushing children into boxes. LGBTQ advocates point out how crucial it is to create some\nspace for children around these issues to allow them to figure out for themselves where they stand on the\nmany dimensions of gender. For some children, exploring gender expression is just that\u2014they need to spend\ntime in the \u201cmiddle space.\u201d If we have to categorize, these children are gender non-conforming in\nexpression, but gender-conforming in identity and sexual orientation. This can be seen in how annoyed\nsome \u201cpink boys\u201d who wear dresses and long hair become when people mistake them for girls (Padawer,\n2012). When asked why this was so annoying, one little guy named P.J. told the reporter about a boy in his\nthird-grade class who is a soccer fanatic. \u201cHe comes to school every day in a soccer jersey and sweat pants,\u201d\nP. J. said, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t make him a professional soccer player.\u201d It\u2019s as if these children need to remind\nadults about the essential defining features of male and female biological sex. P.J. could say, \u201cDuh\u2014I still\nhave a penis, so I am still a boy.\u201d\nFor other children, exploring gender expression is the beginning of the realization that their sexual\norientation may not be heterosexual, that they may be gay, lesbian, and/or bisexual. Some writers have\ntried to quantify the numbers of gender-nonconforming boys, suggesting that 2-7% of boys display\nnonconforming gender behavior, and of these 60-80% grow up to be gay men (Padawer, 2012). The same\ntendency is suggested for lesbian women, most of whom identified as \u201ctomboys.\u201d It seems that these\nnumbers would be very difficult to confirm, given that more than 75% of women identify as \u201ctomboys\u201d and\nmost of them are heterosexual, and given the stringent attempts to shove gender nonconforming boys back\ninto their boxes which means that we are only observing the most determined and tenacious\nnonconforming boys.\nFor some children, gender non-conforming behavior is the beginning of the realization that they are\ntransgender. Some children are very clear on this early on, and insist on names, pronouns, and gender\nexpressions that are consonant with their own internal convictions about their actual gender. Other\nchildren need the opportunity to explore and question, and they may not become clear on their sexual\norientation or transgender status until they reach puberty or later.\nParents of gender non-conforming children. Gender non-conforming children may be more or less clear about why\nthey need to explore the \u201cmiddle space,\u201d but some parents are just confused. Most of us have been fully socialized in\nthe current gender curriculum and so any activity outside those lines and boxes may seem deeply \u201cwrong\u201d or even\n\u201cunnatural.\u201d That is always the way with strong societal norms. In the 1800s, if a woman showed a glimpse of ankle, she\nwas considered to be immoral; in the 1920s, women wearing pants and short hair were seen as \u201cunnatural;\u201d in the 1960s,\nboys whose hair touched their collars were suspended from school.\nGender non-conforming children provide their adults with\nthe opportunity and motivation to improve society in ways\nthat are more positive for everyone. The need that all\n\u201cIt\u2019s not their job to make sure we\u2019re all\nchildren have for their parents\u2019 full love and support\ncomfortable.\u201d\nencourages adults to grow outside of their comfort zones,\n\u2014 Parent of a gender non-conforming child.\nand to develop into better parents. As Brill and Pepper\n(2008) point out, \u201cIt takes courage to follow the path of\nlove.\u201d They provide many good strategies and resources for\nparents who are trying to follow this path. They point out that some of parents\u2019 reluctance can be based on their fear of\nothers looking down on them and criticizing their parenting. We think that many parents can relate to this fear\u2014even in\nlittle ways, such as when a child throws a fit in the store or we are called into school for a child\u2019s infraction. We are\nGender Development | 215 worried that our parenting is inadequate or that others will think we are inferior parents. That is one important reason\nwhy Brill and Pepper (2008) insist that parents get support for themselves (from therapists or groups of like-minded\nparents) so the they will be able in turn to provide acceptance and support for their children.\nSome of the reluctance of parents of transgender children can be based in grief over the loss of their previous child.\nWe think that many parents can also relate to this feeling\u2014when we look at photos of our children as babies and young\nchildren, we miss those darling little versions of our children. At the same time, we know that they are still there in\nthe core identity of our older children. And parents of gender variant children can be comforted with the idea that\nthe essence of their child, their child\u2019s core, is still there, and still intact. Most parents also feel vindicated when they\nsee their child\u2019s distress and depression lift (some children are actually suicidal), and watch them bloom in their new\naffirmed identity, showing joy and delight in the free expression of their authentic selves.\nDealing with discrimination and bullying. An important part of parents\u2019 reluctance to support gender\nvariant children can be based on fears about the reactions their children may encounter in school, church,\nor other public places. Parents are not wrong about these reactions, and their desire to protect their\nchildren is understandable. These same issues have been faced by parents of children who belong to racial,\nethnic, and cultural minorities\u2014who also have to face messages of hate, discrimination, and oppression.\nOne difference may be that some parents feel that their gender variant child could avoid all these upsetting\nexperiences if only they would conform, whereas most Black parents do not see the solution to racism as\nencouraging their children to \u201cpass\u201d as white. Research on parenting children from racial and ethnic\nminority backgrounds suggests that the most helpful approach involves proud support for a child\u2019s minority\nstatus and engaged participation with minority communities, combined with realistic training about how to\ndeal constructively with incidents of intolerance. Some parenting guides suggest strategies organized\naround the notions of: (1) Talk: speak up for what you believe; (2) Walk: find a safe space; and (3) Squawk: find\nsomeone who will support you.\nAt the same time, many parents may surprise themselves by becoming staunch advocates for their children\u2019s\nrights and activists in the larger societal movement for gender respect and equality. Luckily, as parents work\nhard to see that their children are treated fairly everywhere they go, there are good programs that can be\nused to improve schools. These programs train teachers, administrators, and staff how to celebrate and\nsupport gender diversity. The good news is that such trainings can have positive effects for everyone\ninvolved.\n4. Gender latency. A fourth major developmental milestone takes place during middle childhood, sometimes referred to\nas the \u201clatency\u201d stage or phase, and loosely modeled after Freud\u2019s description of children\u2019s psychosexual stages. During\nthis period (about ages 8 or 9 until puberty), children seem to be less active in working out issues explicitly connected\nto gender or sexual identity. In general, children seem to be more mellow or laid back about the whole \u201cgender thing,\u201d\nlargely recognizing that scripts about gender-appropriate signifiers (like colors, behaviors, or activities) are societal\nconventions and not true moral issues. At this age, children seem to relax their enforcement of gender rules and the\n\u201cyuckiness\u201d of the opposite sex begins to fade. Many gender variant children, during this period, also seem to relax,\nmaybe deciding that non-conformity is more trouble than it is worth, and so (at least temporarily) adopting conventional\nsignifiers that are more aligned with their biological sex.\nFor parents who are worried about the effects of hetero-normative gender stereotypes, it can feel like your child has\nmade it safely through the gender curriculum and come out whole on the other side. For parents who are worried about\ntheir gender-nonconforming children, it can also feel like the \u201cproblem\u201d has been solved and it was (after all) just a phase.\n216 | Gender Development 5. Puberty and the gender police. A fifth major milestone in gender development is ushered in by puberty, which usually\nstarts between ages 10-12 for girls and between ages 12-14 for boys. The reality of biological changes in both primary and\nsecondary sexual characteristics seems to trigger a major shift, not only in children\u2019s neurophysiology, but also in their\npsychological systems and social relationships. When puberty strikes, the issue of what it means to be male and female\nin this historical moment seems to come to center stage, and teenagers in middle school and early high school seem\nto be trying to enact and rigidly enforce all of society\u2019s current stereotypes about gender. This process is labeled \u201cgender\nintensification\u201d and it will be more or less \u201cintense\u201d depending on the local culture, their stereotypes, and the rigidity\nwith which they are viewed.\nGender intensification. This is the moment at which adolescents seem to want to wring any gender variation out of\nthemselves and their peers, and this goes for kids who vary on expression, identity, sexual orientation, and transgender\nstatus\u2014which basically includes everyone. So pressure is exerted on girls to look and act more like girls\u2014and we see girls\ntry to bring themselves into line with cultural stereotypes about the value of beauty through increased use of make-up,\nclothes, and hairstyles as well as through a focus on diet, exercise, and eating disorders; we also see normative losses\nin self-esteem as girls find themselves unable to reach these idealized female appearances and increasingly internalize\na negative body image. The pressure that is exerted on boys to look and act like boys can be observed as boys try to\nbring themselves into line with cultural stereotypes about the value of power, through adolescents\u2019 increased use of\naggression and bullying, boys\u2019 frequent lapses into silence, as well as increased focus on body building and the abuse of\nsteroids. Both genders are at risk for commodifying the opposite sex\u2014girls can regard \u201cboyfriends\u201d as status objects just\nas boys can regard girls as sexual targets. Perhaps surprisingly, the local external pressures to adhere to societal gender\nstereotypes seem to originate largely within gender, in that girls tighten the screws on other girls to conform whereas\nboys are the ones who are pressuring other boys. During early adolescence, some researchers refer to the phase of\ngender intensification as a period that is run by the \u201cgender police.\u201d\nIt is important to note that the gender harassment and bullying that is still so common in schools and neighborhoods\nis often aimed at heterosexual youth who do not conform to societal boxes and lines, such as late-maturing boys who\nare small, slight, and shy. Of course, the further that a child strays over gender lines, the more they are likely to become\ntargets of harassment and bullying, not only by peers but also by parents, teachers, and societal institutions.\nGender contraction. In a way this phase could also be referred to as a period of \u201cgender contraction,\u201d in that some\nadolescents fall over themselves to jump back into the boxes and over the lines prescribed by society, especially in terms\nof gender expression. However, the onset of puberty also brings additional biological information to some adolescents,\nindicating (or verifying) that they may be (or definitely are) gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, or transgender. This new\ninformation (or clarity) comes at exactly the same time that the external world brings increased pressure for them to\nconform. Such social pressures (and the internal pressures they can create) can collide with adolescents\u2019 natural sexual\nurges to create confusion and internal gridlock. For some youth, when their internal states (biological urges, gender\nidentity, and sexual orientation) are aligned, they may achieve internal clarity\u2014\u201cAh-ha, I\u2019m gay (or lesbian or bisexual)!\u201d\nSome adults describe this process as \u201ccoming out to oneself.\u201d But for many gender variant youth, external pressure and\nhomophobia can make this process feel very confusing and dangerous. For these children, their adolescent peers (and\noften parents, siblings, and teachers) feel more like \u201cgender Nazis.\u201d\nPause on puberty. For some youth, the beginnings of puberty may trigger an awareness of (or verify) their\ntransgender status\u2014\u201cMy body is going the wrong direction here\u2014wait!\u201d In fact, one cutting edge strategy\nfor children who may be transgender is to stop the transformation\u2014literally using hormone blockers that\nhalt the onset of puberty. This strategy creates a space that preserves children\u2019s options. It is much easier\nGender Development | 217 physiologically to transition to another gender before puberty has been completed. This allows for a\ntransition that is more complete and requires fewer surgeries. For parents of transgender children who\nwant to give their child the opportunity to make an autonomous informed decision, the use of hormone\nblockers allows children to continue developing cognitively so that their decision can be made using all the\ncapacities of formal operations. Families also benefit from the participation of experienced therapists and\nphysicians, who can help guide them in the sequence and timing of each step.\nLGBTQ advocates also insist that it is important to follow the child\u2019s lead, and not to get ahead of them.\nSome families can be so confused by a child\u2019s non-conforming gender expression that they pressure the\nchild to change their biological sex in order to produce a child who is culturally \u201caligned\u201d in expression,\nidentity, and biology. In fact, as previously mentioned, many transgender individuals do not choose to make\na physical transition at all.\nIn every case, children need full family support in order to negotiate the external pressures they will likely\nexperience and otherwise internalize. If transgender teens decide to transition during high school, some\nexperts recommend allowing the child to take a year off from school or be home-schooled for a year, so that\nthey are sheltered from external scrutiny. Some families also decide that the child should then return with\ntheir new identity to a different school, but other transgender teens report that an important part of the\nprocess of self-acceptance is the experience of winning over support from their current peers. In their\nstories of transition (Kuklin, 2014), some teens seem remarkably understanding of the reluctance and flak\nthey experience in forging a new identity, even though all of them make clear that such resistance (and in\nmany cases overt hostility) causes real pain and suffering.\n6. Identity development during college and the freedom to explore and expand. For many youth, the full development\nof an authentic gender identity doesn\u2019t take place until after high school, which is why the college years are such a\ncommon time for gender confirming and non-conforming youth to be working on issues of gender identity and sexual\norientation. Developmentally, these are good years for many reasons. In most strata of society, the \u201cgender police\u201d\nstart to fade during mid-adolescence and, by emerging adulthood, most forms of gender expression are again viewed\nas conventions and not as moral prescriptions, so the previously intense external pressures are often more relaxed\n(again\u2014depending on local geographical and religious perspectives).\nYouth themselves have newly emerging meta-cognitive capacities to reflect on their own internalized stereotypes and\nshame, allowing them to be able to rework for themselves their own attitudes about gender and sexuality. Because many\nstudents are working on these issues, college is also a place where questioning youth can more easily find open and\nunderstanding social and sexual partners with whom they can safely explore these issues. Moreover, college campuses\ncan be places that provide formal resources (e.g., Queer Resource Center, LGBTQ groups) and informal role models, that\nencourage youth to discover, liberate, and celebrate their authentic selves.\nExploration and commitment. During the years of emerging adulthood, many youth are figuring out that they can create\ntheir own narratives about what it means to be male and female in society. Many will affirm a positive appraisal of\ntheir assigned sex as an anchor of their gender identity, but at the same time accept and enjoy a wide-ranging set of\nexpressions, activities, and roles that are vastly expanded compared to societal stereotypes. In fact, increasingly, many\nwill come to view the \u201cmiddle space\u201d as occupying pretty much all the space depicting gender roles, so much so that\nfor many young adults, the issues surrounding biological sex, that is, being male or female, begin to shrink until gender\nis a very small, almost incidental, part of their identity. Of course, young adults often return to these issues and what\n218 | Gender Development they mean as they approach the developmental task of \u201cintimacy,\u201d which is often worked on in the context of sexual\nrelationships.\nSome LGBTQ youth report that emerging adulthood was a good time for them to deal with these issues because they\nneeded to wait until they had worked out other less-contested aspects of their identity so they could be strong and\nself-confident enough to face and explore issues of sexual orientation and gender identity in a society that is so openly\nhostile to gender expansion. For example, some youth reported feeling mixed up about gender identity and sexual\norientation. Some transgender youth felt that they were not allowed to be sexually attracted to people who were of the\nsex opposite to their original biological sex. For example, if I am assigned a female biological sex at birth and later realize\nthat I am an affirmed (transgender) male, what does it mean if I am attracted to biological males? Does that threaten\nmy identity as an affirmed male? During early adulthood, transgender youth can come to accept what LGBTQ experts\nconfirm\u2014that transgender status and sexual orientation are separate issues. An affirmed male who is attracted to other\nmen is a gay transgender male person. All combinations are possible.\nSex/Gender Differences\nAs part of the study of gender development, researchers are also interested in examining sex/gender differences\nin psychological characteristics and behaviors. Researchers who favor different meta-theoretical perspectives often\nassume that gender differences are due to underlying differences in biology (consistent with maturational metatheories)\nor differences in socialization (consistent with mechanistic meta-theories). However, consistent with contextualist\nmeta-theories, to date most of the differences that have been found have turned out to be a complex combination of\nneurophysiological sex differences (e.g. the effects of sex hormones on behavior), gender roles (i.e., differences in how\nmen and women are supposed to act), gender stereotypes (i.e., differences in how we think men and women are), and\ngender socialization.\nWhat are these gender differences? Research suggests that they are concentrated in six areas.\n1. Activity level. In terms of temperament, boys show higher activity levels starting at birth, as seen in differences in\nmuscle tone, muscle mass, and movement; as they get older, boys remain somewhat more active and have more\ndifficulty in activities that require holding still. Some of the biggest differences involve the play styles of children.\nBoys frequently play organized rough-and-tumble games in large groups, while girls often play less-physical\nactivities in much smaller groups (Maccoby, 1998).\n2. Verbal ability. Girls develop language skills earlier and know more words than boys. They show slightly higher\nverbal abilities, including reading and writing, all throughout school, and are somewhat more emotionally\nexpressive (of fear and sadness, but not anger).\n3. Visuo-spatial ability. Boys perform slightly better than girls on tests of visuo-spatial ability (e.g., tests of mentally\nrotating 3-D objects), differences which can later be seen in activities like map reading or sports that require\nspatial orientation.\n4. Verbal and physical aggression. Starting at about the age of 2, boys exhibit higher rates of unprovoked physical\naggression than girls, although no gender differences have been found in provoked aggression (Hyde, 2005). At\nevery age, boys show higher levels of physical aggression, but starting in adolescence, girls show higher levels of\nrelational aggression (e.g., social shunning, gossiping, power exertion).\n5. Self-regulation and prosocial behavior. At about the same age that gender differences in aggression emerge\n(approximately age 2), gender differences also emerge in levels of self-regulation, compliance, empathy, and\nprosocial behavior. Girls show better behavioral and emotional self-regulation, whereas boys have more trouble\nminding and following rules and routines. As they get older boys are also slightly less able to suppress\ninappropriate responses and slightly more likely to blurt things out than girls (Else-Quest, Hyde, Goldsmith, & Van\nHulle, 2006). At the same time, girls are also more likely to offer praise, to agree with the person they\u2019re talking to,\nGender Development | 219 and to elaborate on the other person\u2019s comments; boys, in contrast, are more likely to assert their opinion and\noffer criticisms (Leaper & Smith, 2004). The combination of higher levels of aggression and lower levels of self-\nregulation is a primary reason why, compared to girls, boys at every age are more likely to be disciplined (as well as\nsuspended and expelled) in school.\n6. Developmental vulnerability. One of the biggest and most consistent set of sex/gender differences between girls\nand boys is found in the area of developmental vulnerability. Boys are more likely than girls to show markers of a\nwide range of biological and psychological vulnerabilities, including prenatal and perinatal stress and disease (e.g.,\nlower survival rates in premature birth, higher rates of infant mortality and death from SIDS), learning disabilities\n(e.g., dyslexia, speech defects, mental retardation), neurological conditions (e.g., autism, attention deficit disorder,\nhyperactivity), and mental health conditions (e.g., opposition/defiant disorder, schizophrenia). Starting in early\nadolescence, compared to girls, boys are more likely to be involved in acts of anti-social behavior, delinquency, and\nviolent crime, and to be incarcerated. Unlike differences in psychological characteristics, which tend to be small\nand inconsistent, gender differences in these markers of vulnerability tend to be large and robust. For example,\nrates of ADHD and autism are 3-5 times higher in boys, and over 90% of inmates are male. Differences in\ndiagnosis may represent actual differences in incidence, or conditions may present differently in girls than in boys.\nThe only mental health conditions more prevalent in girls are internalizing disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety)\nbut boys have higher rates of completed suicide at every age, with an increasing gap over adulthood, until by\nage 65 over 70% of suicides are committed by men. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190313-why-more-\nmen-kill-themselves-than-women\nMagnitude of gender differences. It is important to note that, with the exception of sex/gender differences in physical\ncharacteristics (e.g., height and muscle mass) and developmental vulnerability, sex/gender differences in psychological\ncharacteristics and behaviors tend to be quite small, inconsistent, and change over historical time. Even where sex/\ngender differences are found, there is a great deal of variation among females and among males, meaning that individual\nboys are very different from one another as are individual girls. As a result, knowing someone\u2019s gender does not help\nmuch in predicting their actual attributes or behaviors. For example, in terms of activity level, boys are considered more\nactive than girls. However, 42% of girls are more active than the average boy (but so are 50% of boys). Figure 1 depicts\nthis phenomenon in a comparison of male and female self-esteem. The two bell-curves show the range in self-esteem\nscores within boys and within girls, and there is enormous overlap. The average gender difference, shown by the arrow\nat the top of the figure, is tiny compared to the variation within gender.\nFigure 6.16. While our\ngender stereotypes paint\nmales and females as\ndrastically different from\neach other, even when a\ndifference exists, there is\nconsiderable overlap in\nthe levels of that trait\nbetween genders. This\ngraph shows the average\ndifference in self-esteem\nbetween boys and girls.\nBoys have a higher\naverage self-esteem than\ngirls, but the average\nscores are much more\nsimilar than different.\nThis visualization was\ncreated based on Hyde,\n2005 and Cohen\u2019s D\neffect sizes reported in\nKling et al, 1999.\n220 | Gender Development Furthermore, few gender differences reflect innate biological differences, but instead reflect complex mixtures of\nneurophysiological and social factors, with a special emphasis on the specific societal and familial gender curriculum\nthat creates sets of differential opportunities, treatment, and experiences for girls and boys. For example, one small\ngender difference is that boys show better spatial abilities than girls. However, Tzuriel and Egozi (2010) gave girls\nthe chance to practice their spatial skills (by imagining a line drawing was different shapes) and discovered that,\nwith practice, this gender difference completely disappeared. Likewise, those differences also disappear in groups of\ngirls who are involved in sports which require spatial practice. The fact that gender differences that previously were\nsignificant (e.g., boys performed better on math achievement tests during early adolescence) have disappeared over time\nsuggests that they are largely a function of environmental differences (in this case, the number of math classes taken).\nSome of the most interesting research on sex/gender differences today critiques this entire area of work and argues\nthat many domains that we assume differ across genders, including some described here in your textbook, are really\nbased on gender stereotypes and not actual differences. Researchers conducted large meta-analyses (statistical\nanalyses that allow researchers to systematically combine findings across an entire body of studies) of thousands of\nstudies across more than a million participants, and concluded that: Girls are not more fearful, shy, or scared of new\nthings than boys; boys are not more angry than girls and girls are not more emotional than boys; boys do not perform\nbetter at math than girls; and girls are not more talkative than boys (Hyde, 2005). These meta-analyses have also been\nconducted on studies involving adults, with much the same conclusion (Carothers & Reis, 2013; Hyde, Bigler, Joel, Tate,\n& van Anders, 2019).\nLiberating Society from Status Hierarchies of Gender and Sexuality\nSocieties play a crucial role in gender development by trying to dictate hierarchies of human worth based on gender and\nsexuality. Gender is multi-faceted and so status hierarchies cover biological sex, gender expression, sexual orientation,\nand identity. Hierarchies are apparent in the relative value placed on males versus females, on people who are\nheterosexual versus lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and transgender, and on people who conform to the gender binary\nversus people who do not. Some of these hierarchies are enshrined in law, for example, when women were not allowed\nto vote, or homosexuality was illegal, or laws refuse to recognize the legitimacy of transgender sexual identities.\nThese status hierarchies are enforced in all the ways we discussed in previous readings on higher-order contexts of\ndevelopment, including implicit bias, prejudice, stereotypes, segregation, exclusion, and discrimination. Discrimination\npersists throughout the lifespan in the form of obstacles to education, or lack of access to political, financial, and social\npower. Status hierarchies also involve entrenched myths about subgroups who fall into different rungs of the societal\nladders of these hierarchies, and cover stories that membership in some of these groups is voluntary and something\nyouth should \u201cget over.\u201d The negative stories society tells are hurtful, especially if children and youth internalize them. At\nthe same time, the development of people at the top of these hierarchies can also be adversely affected, as when narrow\ndefinitions of masculinity can impede the development of boys and men, and narrow definitions of heterosexuality can\ninterfere with the sexual exploration of youth.\nSocietal myths about gender minorities are especially harmful when they infect parents and families who are supposed\nto be protecting children and promoting their development. For children from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds,\ntheir staunchest supporters typically are parents, extended family, and racial and ethnic communities, who counteract\nthese myths and provide counter-narratives of positivity, pride, and cultural heritage. However, for children from gender\nminorities, parents and families may not serve this vital role. Because parents often do not share their child\u2019s gender\nidentity, and may sometimes even harbor entrenched myths of revulsion, children from gender minorities do not\nalways have the layers of protection provided by extended family, that serve to buffer them from the worst of society\u2019s\nprejudices. In fact, some of the most hurtful messages may come from family and friends. These status hierarchies and\nthe entrenched myths used to enforce them create hazardous conditions for the development of children and youth. A\ngrowing realization of their extent and severity should create an even greater sense urgency for taking collective action\nGender Development | 221 to abolish them. In the meantime women\u2019s groups and the LGBTQ+ community are creating safe spaces where their\nmembers can experience the support and validation they deserve and develop strategies for resistance and resilience.\nThese issues are of global concern (WHO, 2011). Although we are rightfully worried about status hierarchies in the\nUS, many countries around the world have much worse (and sometimes life-threatening) conditions for women and\ngirls, LGBTQ+ youth and adults, and gender minorities. For example, in some countries where gender preferences are\npronounced, it is no longer legal to give parents information on the sex of their fetus because selective abortion of\nfemales has created a gender imbalance that is noticeable at the national level. In many cultures, women do not have\naccess to basic rights (e.g., to education, freedom of movement, choice of spouses and sexual partners, etc.), and sexual\nminorities who express their preferences openly do so at risk of imprisonment and death.\nWhat are the impacts of enforcing gender stereotypes and valuing or devaluing particular gender identities?\nLike all status hierarchies, these societal conditions exert a downward pressure on healthy development. In the United\nStates, the stereotypes that boys should be strong, forceful, active, dominant, and rational, and that girls should be\npretty, subordinate, unintelligent, emotional, and talkative are portrayed in children\u2019s toys, books, commercials, video\ngames, movies, television shows, and music. These messages dictate not only how people should act, but also the\nopportunities they are given, how they are treated, and the extent to which they can grow into their full potential.\nEven into college and professional school, women are less vocal in class and much more at risk for sexual harassment\nfrom teachers, coaches, classmates, and professors. These patterns are also found in social interactions and in media\nmessages. In adulthood, these differences are reflected in income gaps between men and women (women working full-\ntime earn about 74 percent the income of men), in higher rates of women targeted for rape and domestic violence,\nhigher rates of eating disorders for females, and in higher rates of violent death for men in young adulthood.\nThe effects of discrimination and bullying can also be seen in disparities in physical and mental health for youth who\nbelong to minority gender identities and sexual orientations (see boxes). Although researchers and other adults are\nrightfully concerned about these disparities, it is important not to buy into deficit assumptions, where researchers\nassume that children and youth at the bottom of these status hierarchies (i.e., females and those with minority gender\nidentities and sexual orientations) are somehow \u201cat risk,\u201d \u201cvulnerable,\u201d or \u201cless than.\u201d We need to protect all children and\nyouth from social contextual conditions that are dangerous for their development, but just like youth from ethnic and\nracial minorities, youth from sexual and gender minorities generally grow up whole, healthy, and resilient.\nOptional Reading:\nIn this brief article, authors Leaper and Brown (2018) summarize findings on the impact that gender\u2013and\nspecifically gender roles, stereotypes, and discrimination\u2013have on children\u2019s development. In three sections\n(beginning on page 2), their paper reviews recent research on how these factors impact development in\nareas of gender identity and expression, academic achievement, and harassment, respectively.\nClick here to read: Leaper, C., & Brown, C. S. (2018). Sexism in childhood and adolescence: Recent trends and\nadvances in research. Child development perspectives, 12(1), 10-15.\nNote: There is some disagreement among researchers on the exact meaning of the term \u201csexism.\u201d The authors of\nthis paper use the term \u201csexism\u201d to refer to gender roles, stereotypes, discrimination, biases (positive and\nnegative), and gender differences, as well as general beliefs, cognitions, and expectations about gender. We\nprefer the more-common usage of \u201csexism\u201d as referring to gender discrimination in line with the status\nhierarchy defined above (i.e. with women and LGBTQ individuals at the bottom), that gender discrimination\n222 | Gender Development refers to any discrimination on the basis of gender (e.g. against men or women), and although concepts such as\ngender roles and gender cognitions are related to sexism, they are distinct ideas and better referred to with\nmore precise terms.\nDiscrimination based on Sexual Orientation. The United States is heteronormative, meaning that society\nsupports heterosexuality as the norm. Consider, for example, that homosexuals are often asked, \u201cWhen did\nyou know you were gay?\u201d but heterosexuals are rarely asked, \u201cWhen did you know you were straight?\u201d (Ryle,\n2011). Living in a culture that privileges heterosexuality has a significant impact on the ways in which non-\nheterosexual people are able to develop and express their sexuality.\nOpen identification of one\u2019s sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobia which encompasses a range\nof negative attitudes and stereotypes toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). It can be expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion,\nor hatred; it may be based on irrational fear and is sometimes related to religious beliefs (Carroll, 2016).\nHomophobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior, such as discrimination and violence on the basis\nof sexual orientations that are non-heterosexual. Recognized types of homophobia include institutionalized\nhomophobia, such as religious and state-sponsored homophobia, and internalized homophobia in which\npeople with same-sex attractions internalize, or believe, society\u2019s negative views and/or hatred of themselves.\nSexual minorities regularly experience stigma, harassment, discrimination, and violence based on their\nsexual orientation (Carroll, 2016). Research has shown that gay, lesbian, and bisexual teenagers are at a\nhigher risk of depression and suicide due to exclusion from social groups, rejection from peers and family,\nand negative media portrayals of homosexuals (Bauermeister et al., 2010). Discrimination can occur in the\nworkplace, in housing, at schools, and in numerous public settings. Major policies to prevent discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation have only come into effect in the United States in the last few years.\nThe majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-\nclass, well-educated samples. This demographic limits our understanding of more marginalized sub-\npopulations that are also affected by racism, classism, and other forms of oppression. In the United States,\nnon-Caucasian LGBT individuals may find themselves in a double minority, in which they are not fully\naccepted or understood by Caucasian LGBT communities and are also not accepted by their own ethnic\ngroup (Tye, 2006). Many people experience racism in in the dominant LGBT community where racial\nstereotypes merge with gender stereotypes.\nDiscrimination based on Gender Minority status. Gender nonconforming people are much more likely to\nexperience harassment, bullying, and violence based on their gender identity; they also experience much\nhigher rates of discrimination in housing, employment, healthcare, and education (Borgogna, McDermott,\nAita, & Kridel, 2019; National Center for Transgender Equality, 2015). Transgender individuals of color face\nadditional financial, social, and interpersonal challenges, in comparison to the transgender community as a\nGender Development | 223 whole, as a result of structural racism. Black transgender people reported the highest level of discrimination\namong all transgender individuals of color. As members of several intersecting minority groups, transgender\npeople of color, and transgender women of color in particular, are especially vulnerable to employment\ndiscrimination, health disparities, harassment, and violence. Consequently, they face even greater obstacles\nthan white transgender individuals and cisgender members of their own race.\nEffects of Gender Minority Discrimination on Mental Health. Using data from over 43,000 college students,\nBorgona et al. (2019) examined mental health disparities among several gender groups, including those\nidentifying as cisgender, transgender, and gender nonconforming. Results indicated that participants who\nidentified as transgender and gender nonconforming had significantly higher levels of anxiety and\ndepression than those identifying as cisgender. Bargona et al. explained the higher rates of anxiety and\ndepression using the minority stress model, which holds that an unaccepting social environment results in\nboth external and internal stress which can take a toll on mental health. External stressors include\ndiscrimination, harassment, and prejudice, while internal stressors include negative thoughts, feelings and\nemotions resulting from societal messages about one\u2019s identity. Borgona et al. recommend that mental\nhealth services be made accessible that are sensitive to both gender minority and sexual minority status.\nHow do we create gender-affirming social contexts for children and youth?\nStarting at birth, children learn the social meanings of gender from their society and culture. Gender roles and\nexpectations are especially portrayed in children\u2019s toys, books, commercials, video games, movies, television shows\nand music (Knorr, 2017). Therefore, when children make choices regarding their gender identification, expression, or\nbehavior that do not conform to gender stereotypes, it is important that they feel supported by the caring adults in\ntheir lives. This support allows children to feel valued, resilient, and develop a secure sense of self (American Academy\nof Pediatricians, 2015). People who care about the healthy gender development of children and youth, like their parents,\nfamilies, friends, classmates, schools, and communities, can create local contexts of celebration and validation that\nallow all children to form complex and multifaceted gender identities. Collective social movements around LGBTQ+\nand women\u2019s rights are having many positive effects in changing current status hierarchies, which will result in social\ncontextual conditions that are better for all our development.\nDevelopmental psychologists, psychiatrists, and pediatricians can play important roles in creating gender-affirming\nsupport for children, youth, and families. For example, in a recent paper on the development of transgender youth,\nDiamond (2020) points out that, \u201cphysicians\u2019 and psychologists\u2019 lack of knowledge about transgender and nonbinary\nidentities can be a significant barrier to competent care (American Psychological Association, 2015). Current practice\nguidelines for both the medical and psychological treatment of transgender youth adopt a gender-affirmative model\nof care, which views gender variation as a basic form of human diversity rather than an inherent pathology, and\nwhich takes a multifaceted approach to supporting and affirming youth\u2019s experienced gender identity and reducing\npsychological distress\u2026 Providing youth\u2014and parents\u2014with more time, support, and information about the full range\nof gender diversity, and the fact that gender expressions and identities may change dynamically across different stages\nof development, may help facilitate more effective decisions about social and medical transitions\u201d (p.112).\nDevelopmental researchers can also make contributions by continuing to explore these complex issues. For example,\nfew studies have been conducted to date, and so more research is needed, on the development of ingroup/outgroup\nbiases (preferences for one\u2019s own gender), reactions to gender norm violations, awareness of preferential treatment,\ngender prejudice and discrimination, and bullying based on gender variation (Martin & Ruble, 2010). Interventionists\ncan work to identify the conditions that promote healthy gender and sexual development. Such studies have shown,\n224 | Gender Development for example, the beneficial effects of inclusive sex education programs in school that foster awareness and acceptance\nof gender diversity. As Diamond (2020) concludes, \u201cstudies suggest that the most beneficial intervention approaches\ninvolve creating safe and supportive spaces for all youth to give voice to diverse experiences of gender identity\nand expression; educating peers, schools, communities, and families about the validity of transgender and nonbinary\nidentities; and providing youth with access to supportive and informed care\u2026 In light of the complexity of adolescent\ngender variation, the best course of action for all youth might involve expanding the gender-affirmative model beyond\nthe conventional gender binary, thereby providing a broader range of options for identity and expression, and affirming\nand supporting the experiences of youth with complex, nonbinary identities\u2026 Whether a child identifies as male,\nfemale, transgender, gender fluid, or nonbinary, environments that foster self-acceptance, validation, openness,\nbroadmindedness, and support regarding gender expression will yield lasting benefits.\u201d (p. 113)\nOptional Reading:\nCurrent research is now looking at those young children who identify as transgender and have socially\ntransitioned. In 2013, a longitudinal study following 300 socially transitioned transgender children between\nthe ages of 3 and 12 began (Olson & G\u00fclg\u00f6z, 2018). Socially transitioned transgender children identify with\nthe gender opposite to the one they were assigned at birth, and they change their appearance and pronouns\nto reflect their gender identity. Findings from the study indicated that the gender development of these\nsocially transitioned children looked similar to the gender development of cisgender children, or those\nwhose gender is aligned to the sex they were assigned at birth. These socially transitioned transgender\nchildren exhibited similar gender preferences and gender identities as their gender matched peers. Further,\nthese children, who were living every day according to their gender identity and were supported by their\nfamilies, exhibited positive mental health.\nClick here to read: Olson, K.

Child Development Perspectives, 12(2), 93-97.\nOlson and G\u00fclg\u00f6z\u2019 study not only echoes an increasing consensus among pediatricians and other experts in child\ndevelopment that affirming non-conforming children in their own felt sense of gender seems to be the best course for\npromoting children\u2019s development (e.g. Rafferty, Donaldson, & Forcier, 2020) and also underlines an important takeaway\nlesson: Increasingly, it seems that it is possible to reduce the negative outcomes reported previously for gender non-\nconforming children if children are supported by their families, schools, and societies in developing into their authentic\nselves.\nComplexity, Truth, and Beauty\nGender development is inherently complex, involving many dimensions of biological sex, gender expression and identity,\nas well as temperament, intrinsic interests, cognitive constructions, social relationships, and changing historical and\nsocietal frames. Together, these forces create an infinite number of unique and individual pathways, which cannot be\ncaptured by two boxes and cannot be nurtured by drawing and enforcing arbitrary lines. Notions like gender expansion,\ncreativity, and fluidity can become goals that we both support and strive for in our own development and in the\ndevelopment of all those whose nurturance has been entrusted to us.\nGender Development | 225 Supplemental Materials\n\u2022 This Ted talk features a non-binary pre-teen, who discusses their gender journey.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

These beliefs include personal attributes,\nsuch as one\u2019s age, physical characteristics, behaviors, and competencies. Children in middle and late childhood have a\nmore realistic sense of self than do those in early childhood, and they better understand their strengths and weaknesses.\nThis can be attributed to greater experience in comparing their own performance with that of others, and to greater\ncognitive flexibility. Children in middle and late childhood are also able to include other peoples\u2019 appraisals of them into\ntheir self-concept, including parents, teachers, peers, culture, and media. Internalizing others\u2019 appraisals and creating\nsocial comparison affect children\u2019s self-esteem, which is defined as an evaluation of one\u2019s identity. Children can have\nindividual assessments of how well they perform a variety of activities and also develop an overall global self-assessment.\nIf there is a discrepancy between how children view themselves and what they consider to be their ideal selves, their\nself-esteem can be negatively affected.\nAnother important development in self-understanding is self-\nefficacy, which is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a\nspecific task or of reaching a specific goal (Bandura, 1977, 1986,\n1997). Large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can\ncreate motivational problems for the individual (Seifert, 2011). If\na student believes that he or she can solve mathematical\nproblems, then the student is more likely to attempt the\nmathematics homework that the teacher assigns.\nUnfortunately, the converse is also true. If a student believes\nthat he or she is incapable of math, then the student is less likely\nto attempt the math homework regardless of the student\u2019s\nactual ability in math. Since self-efficacy is self-constructed, it\nFigure 7.1. Hopefully these children have self-efficacy about is possible for students to miscalculate or misperceive their\nplaying the violin\ntrue skill, and these misperceptions can have complex effects\non students\u2019 motivations. It is possible to have either too much\nor too little self-efficacy, and according to Bandura (1997) the optimum level seems to be either at, or slightly above,\none\u2019s true ability.\n232 | Intelligence, Education, & Motivational Development Theories of Intelligence\nPsychologists have long debated how to best conceptualize and measure\nintelligence (Sternberg, 2003). These questions include: How many types of\nintelligence there are, the role of nature versus nurture in intelligence, how\nintelligence is represented in the brain, and the meaning of group\ndifferences in intelligence.\nGeneral (g) versus Specific (s) Intelligences. From 1904-1905 the French\npsychologist Alfred Binet (1857\u20131914) and his colleague Th\u00e9odore Simon\n(1872\u20131961) began working on behalf of the French government to develop a\nmeasure that would identify children who would not be successful with the\nregular school curriculum. The goal was to help teachers better educate\nthese students (Aiken, 1994). Binet and Simon developed what most\npsychologists today regard as the first intelligence test, which consisted of\na wide variety of questions that included the ability to name objects, define\nwords, draw pictures, complete sentences, compare items, and construct Figure 7.2. Alfred Binet\nsentences.\nBinet and Simon (Binet, Simon, & Town, 1915; Siegler, 1992) believed that the questions they asked the children all\nassessed the basic abilities to understand, reason, and make judgments. It turned out that the correlations among these\ndifferent types of measures were in fact all positive; that is, students who got one item correct were more likely to also\nget other items correct, even though the questions themselves were very different.\nOn the basis of these results, the psychologist Charles Spearman (1863\u20131945) hypothesized that there must be a single\nunderlying construct that all of these items measure. He called the construct that the different abilities and skills\nmeasured on intelligence tests have in common the General Intelligence Factor (g). Virtually all psychologists now believe\nthat there is a generalized intelligence factor, \u201cg\u201d, that relates to abstract thinking and that includes the abilities to\nacquire knowledge, to reason abstractly, to adapt to novel situations, and to benefit from instruction and experience\n(Gottfredson, 1997; Sternberg, 2003). People with higher general intelligence learn faster.\nSoon after Binet and Simon introduced their test, the American psychologist Lewis Terman at Stanford University\n(1877\u20131956) developed an American version of Binet\u2019s test that became known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. The\nStanford-Binet is a measure of general intelligence made up of a wide variety of tasks, including vocabulary, memory for\npictures, naming of familiar objects, repeating sentences, and following commands.\nAlthough there is general agreement among psychologists that \u201cg\u201d exists, there is also evidence for specific intelligence\nor\u201cs\u201d, a measure of specific skills in narrow domains. One empirical result in support of the idea of \u201cs\u201d comes from\nintelligence tests themselves. Although the different types of questions do correlate with each other, some items\ncorrelate more highly with each other than do other items; they form clusters or clumps of intelligences.\nTriarchic Theory. One advocate of the idea of multiple intelligences is the psychologist Robert Sternberg. Sternberg\nhas proposed a triarchic (three-part) theory of intelligence which holds that people may display more or less analytical\nintelligence, creative intelligence, and practical intelligence. Sternberg (1985, 2003) argued that traditional intelligence\ntests assess analytical intelligence, academic problem solving and performing calculations, but that they do not typically\nassess creative intelligence, the ability to adapt to new situations and create new ideas, and/or practical intelligence,\nthe ability to demonstrate common sense and street-smarts.\nAs Sternberg proposed, research has found that creativity is not highly correlated with analytical intelligence (Furnham\nIntelligence, Education, & Motivational Development | 233 & Bachtiar, 2008) and exceptionally creative scientists, artists, mathematicians, and engineers do not score higher on\nintelligence than do their less, creative peers (Simonton, 2000).\nFurthermore, the brain areas that are associated with convergent thinking, thinking that is directed toward finding the\ncorrect answer to a given problem, are different from those associated with divergent thinking, the ability to generate\nmany different ideas or solutions to a single problem (Tarasova, Volf, & Razoumnikova, 2010). On the other hand, being\ncreative often takes some of the basic abilities measured by \u201cg\u201d, including the abilities to learn from experience, to\nremember information, and to think abstractly (Bink & Marsh, 2000). Ericsson (1998), Weisberg (2006), Hennessey and\nAmabile (2010) and Simonton (1992) studied creative people and identified at least five components that are likely to be\nimportant for creativity as listed in Table 7.1.\nTable 7.1 Important Components for Creativity\nComponent Description\nExpertise Creative people have studied and learned about a topic\nImaginative Thinking Creative people view problems in new and different ways\nRisk Taking Creative people take on new, but potentially risky approaches\nIntrinsic Interest Creative people take on projects for interest not money\nWorking in Creative The most creative people are supported, aided, and challenged by other people working on\nEnvironments similar projects\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nThe last aspect of the triarchic model, practical intelligence, refers primarily to intelligence that cannot be gained from\nbooks or formal learning. Practical intelligence represents a type of \u201cstreet smarts\u201d or \u201ccommon sense\u201d that is learned\nfrom life experiences. Although a number of tests have been devised to measure practical intelligence (Sternberg,\nWagner, & Okagaki, 1993; Wagner & Sternberg, 1985), research has not found much evidence that practical intelligence\nis distinct from \u201cg\u201d or that it is predictive of success at particular tasks (Gottfredson, 2003). Practical intelligence may\ninclude, at least in part, certain abilities that help people perform well at specific jobs, and these abilities may not always\nbe highly correlated with general intelligence (Sternberg et al., 1993).\nTheory of Multiple Intelligences. Another champion of the idea of specific types of intelligences rather than one overall\nintelligence is the psychologist Howard Gardner (1983, 1999). Gardner argued that it would be evolutionarily functional\nfor different people to have different talents and skills, and proposed that there are eight intelligences that can be\ndifferentiated from each other. Table 7.2 lists Gardner\u2019s eight specific intelligences.\n234 | Intelligence, Education, & Motivational Development Table 7.2 Howard Gardner's Eight Specific Intelligences\nIntelligence Description\nLinguistic The ability to speak and write well\nLogical-mathematical The ability to use logic and mathematical skills to solve problems\nSpatial The ability to think and reason about objects in three dimensions\nMusical The ability to perform and enjoy music\nKinesthetic (body) The ability to move the body in sports, dance or other physical activities\nInterpersonal The ability to understand and interact effectively with others\nIntrapersonal The ability to have insight into the self\nNaturalistic The ability to recognize, identify, and understand animals, plants, and other living things\nAdapted from Gardner, H. (1999). Intelligence reframed: Multiple intelligences for the 21st century. New York, NY: Basic\nBooks.\nGardner identified these 8 intelligences using multiple sources of evidence. He conducted psychometric analyses of\ntests designed to capture different kinds of intelligence. He also examined evidence from studies of children who were\ntalented in one or more areas, and from studies of adults who suffered brain damage from strokes that compromised\ncapacities in some areas, but not in others. Gardner also noted that some evidence for multiple intelligences comes\nfrom the abilities of autistic savants, people who score low on intelligence tests overall, but who nevertheless may have\nexceptional skills in a given domain, such as math, music, art, or in being able to recite statistics in a given sport (Treffert\n& Wallace, 2004). A potential ninth intelligence; that is, existential intelligence, still needs empirical support.\nThe idea of multiple intelligences has been influential in the field of education, and teachers have used these ideas to\ntry to teach differently to different students. For instance, to teach math problems to students who have particularly\ngood kinesthetic intelligence, a teacher might encourage the students to move their bodies or hands according to\nthe numbers. On the other hand, some have argued that these \u201cintelligences\u201d sometimes seem more like \u201cabilities\u201d or\n\u201ctalents\u201d rather than real intelligence. There is no clear conclusion about how many intelligences there are. Are sense\nof humor, artistic skills, dramatic skills, and so forth also separate intelligences? Furthermore, and again demonstrating\nthe underlying power of a single intelligence, the many different intelligences are, in fact, correlated and thus represent,\nin part, \u201cg\u201d (Brody, 2003).\nMeasuring Intelligence: Standardization and the Intelligence Quotient\nThe goal of most intelligence tests is to measure \u201cg\u201d, the general intelligence factor. Good intelligence tests are reliable,\nmeaning that they are consistent over time, and also demonstrate validity, meaning that they actually measure intelligence\nrather than something else. Because intelligence is such an important individual difference dimension, psychologists\nhave invested substantial effort in creating and improving measures of intelligence, and these tests are now considered\nthe most accurate of all psychological tests. In fact, the ability to accurately assess intelligence is one of the most\nimportant contributions of psychology to everyday public life.\nIntelligence changes with age. A 3-year-old who could accurately multiply 183 by 39 would certainly be intelligent, but a\n25-year-old who could not do so would be seen as unintelligent. Thus, understanding intelligence requires that we know\nthe norms or standards in a given population of people at a given age. The standardization of a test involves giving it to\na large number of people at different ages and computing the average score on the test at each age level.\nIt is important that intelligence tests be standardized on a regular basis, because the overall level of intelligence in a\npopulation may change over time. The Flynn effect refers to the observation that scores on intelligence tests worldwide\nIntelligence, Education, & Motivational Development | 235 have increased substantially over the past decades (Flynn, 1999). Although the increase varies somewhat from country\nto country, the average increase is about 3 IQ points every 10 years. There are many explanations for the Flynn effect,\nincluding better nutrition, increased access to information, and more familiarity with multiple-choice tests (Neisser,\n1998). Whether people are actually getting smarter, however, is debatable (Neisser, 1997). Most of the increase in IQ\noccurred during the second half of the 20th century. Recent research has found a reversal of the Flynn effect in several\nnations around the world, although some nations still show an increase in IQ scores (Dutton, van der Linden, & Lynn,\n2016).\nOnce the standardization has been accomplished, we have a picture of the average abilities of people at different ages\nand can calculate a person\u2019s mental age, which is the age at which a person is performing intellectually. If we compare\nthe mental age of a person to the person\u2019s chronological age, the result is the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a measure of\nintelligence that is adjusted for age. A simple way to calculate IQ is by using the following formula:\nIQ = mental age \u00f7 chronological age \u00d7 100.\nThus a 10-year-old child who does as well as the average 10-year-old child has an IQ of 100 (10 \u00f7 10 \u00d7 100), whereas an\n8-year-old child who does as well as the average 10-year-old child would have an IQ of 125 (10 \u00f7 8 \u00d7 100). Most modern\nintelligence tests are based on the relative position of a person\u2019s score among people of the same age, rather than on\nthe basis of this formula, but the idea of an intelligence \u201cratio\u201d or \u201cquotient\u201d provides a good description of the score\u2019s\nmeaning.\nWechsler Scales. A number of scales are based on the IQ. The Wechsler Adult lntelligence Scale (WAIS) is the most\nwidely used intelligence test for adults (Watkins, Campbell, Nieberding, & Hallmark, 1995). The current version of the\nWAIS, the WAIS-IV, was standardized on 2,200 people ranging from 16 to 90 years of age. It consists of 15 different tasks,\neach designed to assess intelligence, including working memory, arithmetic ability, spatial ability, and general knowledge\nabout the world. The WAIS-IV yields scores on four domains: verbal, perceptual, working memory, and processing\nspeed. The reliability of the test is high (more than 0.95), and it shows substantial construct validity. The WAIS-IV is\ncorrelated highly with other IQ tests such as the Stanford-Binet, as well as with criteria of academic and life success,\nincluding college grades, measures of work performance, and occupational level. It also shows significant correlations\nwith measures of everyday functioning among people with intellectual disabilities.\nThe Wechsler scale has also been adapted for preschool children in the form of the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale\nof Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) and for older children and adolescents in the form of the Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V).\nBias in Tests of Intelligence. Intelligence tests and psychological definitions of intelligence have been heavily criticized\nsince the 1970s for being biased in favor of Anglo-American, middle-class respondents and for being inadequate tools\nfor measuring non-academic types of intelligence or talent. Intelligence changes with experience, and intelligence\nquotients or scores do not reflect that ability to change. What is considered smart varies culturally as well, and most\nintelligence tests do not take this variation into account. For example, in the West, being smart is associated with\nbeing quick. A person who answers a question the fastest is seen as the smartest, but in some cultures being smart is\nassociated with considering an idea thoroughly before giving an answer. A well-thought out, contemplative answer is\nthe best answer.\n\u2022 This required video explores the history of intelligence tests, including their initial creation, their use to justify\neugenics practices, and their inherent flaws.\n236 | Intelligence, Education, & Motivational Development One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:\nhttps://pdx.pressbooks.pub/humandevelopment/?p=111#oembed-1\nEducation\nRemember the ecological systems model (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) that we explored in chapter one? This model helps us\nunderstand an individual by examining the contexts in which the person lives and the direct and indirect influences on\nthat person\u2019s life. School becomes a very important component of children\u2019s lives during middle and late childhood, and\nparents and the culture contribute to children\u2019s educational experiences through their interaction with teachers and\nschools.\nGender. The stereotypes held by parents and teachers can influence children\u2019s self-efficacy in various domains. For\nexample, teachers who hold the view that girls are better at reading (Retelsdorf, Schwartz, & Asbrock, 2015) or boys\nare better at math (Plante, de la Sablonni\u00e8re, Aronson, & Th\u00e9or\u00eat, 2013) often find that their students\u2019 performance in\nthese areas mirror these stereotypes, despite the children\u2019s actual ability, or the ability of children in the classrooms of\nteachers who do not hold such stereotypes. While not all children will internalize the views of others, those who do are\nmore likely to show declines in their performance consistent with the stereotypes (Plante, et al., 2013; Retelsdorf et al.,\n2015).\nParental Involvement in School. Parents vary in their level of involvement with their children\u2019s schools. Teachers\noften complain that they have difficulty getting parents to participate in their child\u2019s education and devise a variety of\ntechniques to keep parents in touch with daily and overall progress. For example, parents may be required to sign a\nbehavior chart each evening to be returned to school or may be given information about the school\u2019s events through\nwebsites and newsletters. There are other factors that need to be considered when looking at parental involvement. To\nexplore these, first ask yourself if all parents who enter the school with concerns about their child will be received in\nthe same way?\nHorvat (2004) found that teachers seek a particular type of involvement from particular types of parents. While teachers\nthought they were open and neutral in their responses to parental involvement, in reality teachers were most receptive\nto support, praise, and agreement coming from parents who were most similar in race and social class with the teachers.\nParents who criticized the school or its policies were less likely to be given voice. Parents who have higher levels of\nincome, occupational status, and other qualities favored in society have family capital. This is a form of power that can\nbe used to improve a child\u2019s education. Parents who do not have these qualities may find it more difficult to be effectively\ninvolved. The authors suggest that teachers closely examine their biases about different kinds of parents. Schools may\nalso need to examine their ability to dialogue with parents about school policies in more open ways. Any efforts to\nimprove effective parental involvement should address these concerns.\nCultural Differences in the Classroom\nBilingualism in Schools. In 2013, approximately 20% of school aged children and adolescents spoke a language other\nthan English in the home (Camarota & Zeigler, 2014). The majority of bilingual students speak Spanish, but the rest\nrepresent more than three hundred different language groups from around the world. In larger communities throughout\nthe United States, it is therefore common for a single classroom to contain students from several different language\nIntelligence, Education, & Motivational Development | 237 backgrounds at the same time. In classrooms, as in other social settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and\ndegrees. At one extreme are students who speak both English and another language fluently; at the other extreme are\nthose who speak only limited versions of both languages. In between are students who speak their home (or heritage)\nlanguage much better than English, as well as others who have partially lost their heritage language in the process of\nlearning English (Tse, 2001). Commonly, a student may speak a language satisfactorily, but be challenged by reading or\nwriting it. That is, children can be bilingual without being biliterate. Whatever the case, each bilingual student brings\nunique strengths and poses unique challenges to teachers.\nThe student who speaks both languages fluently has a definite cognitive advantage. As you might suspect, and research\nconfirms, a fully fluent bilingual student is in a better position to express concepts or ideas in more than one way, and to\nbe aware of doing so (Jimenez, Garcia, & Pearson, 1995; Francis, 2006). Unfortunately, the bilingualism of many students\nis unbalanced in the sense that they are either still learning English, or else they have lost some earlier ability to use\ntheir original, heritage language. Losing one\u2019s original language is a concern as research finds that language loss limits\nstudents\u2019 ability to learn English as well or as quickly as they could do. Having a large vocabulary in a first language has\nbeen shown to save time in learning vocabulary in a second language (Hansen, Umeda & McKinney, 2002). Preserving\nthe first language is important if a student has impaired skill in all languages and therefore needs intervention or help\nfrom a speech-language specialist. Research has found, in such cases, that the specialist can be more effective if the\nspecialist speaks and uses the first language as well as English (Kohnert, Yim, Nett, Kan, & Duran, 2005).\nCultures and ethnic groups differ not only in languages, but also\nin how languages are used. Since some of the patterns differ\nfrom those typical of middle class American classrooms, they\ncan create misunderstandings between teachers and students\n(Cazden, 2001; Rogers, et al., 2005). Consider these examples:\n\u2022 Speaking. In some cultures, it is considered polite or even\nintelligent not to speak unless you have something truly\nimportant to say. Chitchat, or talk that simply affirms a\npersonal tie between people, is considered immature or\nintrusive (Minami, 2002). In a classroom, this habit can make it\nFigure 7.3. Image by unique hwang from Pixabay easier for a child to learn not to interrupt others, but it can\nalso make the child seem unfriendly.\n\u2022 Eye contact. Eye contact varies by culture. In many African American and Latin American communities, it is\nconsidered appropriate and respectful for a child not to look directly at an adult who is speaking to them (Torres-\nGuzman, 1998). In classrooms, however, teachers often expect a lot of eye contact (as in \u201cI want all eyes on me!\u201d)\nand may be tempted to construe lack of eye contact as a sign of indifference or disrespect.\n\u2022 Social distance. Social distance varies by culture. In some cultures, it is common to stand relatively close when\nhaving a conversation; in others, it is more customary to stand relatively far apart (Beaulieu, 2004). Problems may\nhappen when a teacher and a student prefer different social distances. A student who expects a closer distance\nthan does the teacher may seem overly familiar or intrusive, whereas one who expects a longer distance may seem\noverly formal or reserved.\n\u2022 Wait time. Wait time varies by culture. Wait time is the gap between the end of one person\u2019s comment or question\nand the next person\u2019s reply or answer. In some cultures wait time is relatively long, as long as three or four seconds\n(Tharp & Gallimore, 1989). In others it is a negative gap, meaning that it is acceptable, even expected, for a person\nto interrupt before the end of the previous comment. In classrooms the wait time is customarily about one second;\nafter that, the teacher is likely to move on to another question or to another student. A student who habitually\nexpects a wait time longer than one second may seem hesitant, and not be given many chances to speak. A student\nwho expects a negative wait time, on the other hand, may seem overeager or even rude.\n238 | Intelligence, Education, & Motivational Development \u2022 Questions. In most non-Anglo cultures, questions are intended to gain information, and it is assumed that a person\nasking the question truly does not have the information requested (Rogoff, 2003). In most classrooms, however,\nteachers regularly ask test questions, which are questions to which the teacher already knows the answer and that\nsimply assess whether a student knows the answer as well (Macbeth, 2003). The question: \u201cHow much is 2 + 2?\u201d for\nexample, is a test question. If the student is not aware of this purpose, he or she may become confused, or think\nthat the teacher is surprisingly ignorant. Worse yet, the student may feel that the teacher is trying deliberately to\nshame the student by revealing the student\u2019s ignorance or incompetence to others.\n\u2022 Preference for activities that are cooperative rather than\ncompetitive. Many activities in school are competitive, even\nwhen teachers try to de-emphasize the competition. Once\npast the first year or second year of school, students often\nbecome attentive to who receives the highest marks on an\nassignment, for example, or who is the best athlete at\nvarious sports or whose contributions to class discussions\ngets the most verbal recognition from the teacher (Johnson\n& Johnson, 1998). A teacher deliberately organizes\nimportant activities or assignments competitively, as in\n\u201cLet\u2019s see who finishes the math sheet first\u201d. Classroom life\ncan then become explicitly competitive, and the\ncompetitive atmosphere can interfere with cultivating\nFigure 7.4.\nsupportive relationships among students or between\nstudents and the teacher (Cohen, 2004). For students who give priority to these relationships, competition can seem\nconfusing at best and threatening at worst. A student may wonder, \u201cWhat sort of sharing or helping with answers is\nallowed?\u201d The answer to this question may be different depending on the cultural background of the student and\nteacher. What the student views as cooperative sharing may be seen by the teacher as laziness, freeloading, or even\ncheating.\nWhat happened to No Child Left Behind?\nChildren\u2019s academic performance is often measured with the use of standardized tests. Achievement tests\nare used to measure what a child has already learned. Achievement tests are often used as measures of\nteaching effectiveness within a school setting and as a method to make schools that receive tax dollars\n(such as public schools, charter schools, and private schools that receive vouchers) accountable to the\ngovernment for their performance. In 2001, President Bush signed into effect Public Law 107-110, better\nknown as the No Child Left Behind Act mandating that schools administer achievement tests to students\nand publish those results so that parents have an idea of their children\u2019s performance. Additionally, the\ngovernment would have information on the gaps in educational achievement between children from various\nsocial class, racial, and ethnic groups. Schools that showed significant gaps in these levels of performance\nwere mandated to work toward narrowing these gaps. Educators criticized the policy for focusing too much\non testing as the only indication of student performance. Target goals were considered unrealistic and set\nby the federal government rather than individual states. Because these requirements became increasingly\nunworkable for schools, changes to the law were requested. On December 12, 2015 President Obama signed\ninto law Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) (United States Department of Education, 2017). This law is state\nIntelligence, Education, & Motivational Development | 239 driven and focuses on expanding educational opportunities and improving student outcomes, including in\nthe areas of high school graduation, drop-out rates, and college attendance.\nThe Development of Motivation: Mindsets\nMindsets are organized sets of beliefs people have about the nature of ability and what they themselves are capable of\nlearning. They are convictions people come to hold about how competent they are and whether there are limits to how\nmuch more competent they can become.\nWhere do mindsets come from?\nAccording to theories of mastery motivation, babies are born active and curious, ready to learn about the world and\nsee how it works. As a result, infants are highly motivated and busy trying to make things happen\u2014they love to \u201ccreate\neffects,\u201d for example, by waving their arms around, dropping spoons, splashing in the bath, pulling on earrings, and so\non. Mastery motivation (sometimes called intrinsic motivation) is like a motor that sets in motion thousands of these\nexploratory interactions, and through them, babies learn an enormous amount about how to be effective in producing\ndesired and preventing undesired outcomes.\nHow do mindsets develop?\nAs children learn about their environments, however, they are also learning something about themselves: that they\nare competent, efficacious little people, capable of making things happen. They take these beliefs with them into\nother learning contexts, like school, and such beliefs provide an underlying source of confidence, determination, and\npersistence, especially when children run into problems or setbacks.\nThis sense of confidence and competence is called a mastery orientation, and it is one basis for children\u2019s constructive\nengagement with challenging learning activities. When children with a mastery orientation make mistakes or can\u2019t solve\nproblems right away, they roll up their sleeves and work harder, their concentration and strategizing increases, they turn\non the effort and don\u2019t give up. As a result, they learn from their mistakes and benefit from challenges and difficulties.\nThey not only feel more competent and efficacious, they actually become more competent as a result. Over time, these\nexperiences strengthen their mastery orientation.\nDo all children have a mastery orientation?\nNo, unfortunately, many infants and young children grow up in environments where they do NOT have experiences of\ncompetence and control. Their parents are not responsive, they do not come when babies call, or comfort them when\nthey are upset. Parents may even be downright hostile. Children soon learn that their actions don\u2019t matter, that they\nhave no control over their little worlds. This is called a learned helplessness orientation, and it can be seen in infants as\nyoung as 4 months old.\nWhat are the effects of a learned helplessness orientation?\nChildren take helpless attitudes with them into learning contexts, too. Unlike the mastery oriented children, however,\nchildren with a learned helplessness orientation react to obstacles or setbacks with helplessness, which means that they\nbehave as if there is nothing they can do to solve the problem: They become upset and anxious, they give up and don\u2019t\neven try. They avoid challenges and don\u2019t want to try anything new or difficult. As a result, they don\u2019t learn very much.\n240 | Intelligence, Education, & Motivational Development These experiences undermine their confidence even more. Over time, by avoiding challenge and giving up when the\ngoing gets tough, they learn less and start to lose ground. Eventually, they not only feel less competent, they actually\nbecome objectively less competent. It is a vicious cycle.\nWhat are the mindsets that underlie mastery and helpless orientations?\nA researcher named Carol Dweck (Dweck, 2006) has done a lot of research on the kinds of mindsets that children (and\nadults) develop. She has argued that the experiences that we have in achievement contexts (like schools) communicate\nto us the meaning of \u201cintelligence\u201d or \u201csmart-ness.\u201d\nAccording to her work, people tend to develop one of two kinds of mindsets based on their cumulative history of\nexperiences:\n\u2022 Fixed Mindset (aka an entity view of intelligence). In this mindset, people view intelligence as an unchangeable\nthing (an entity). Each of us has a certain amount of ability or talent, and these traits are \u201cfixed,\u201d meaning that they\ncan\u2019t be expanded or improved. In this mindset, children are always trying to \u201cmeasure up,\u201d and they worry about\nrevealing how big (or small) their intelligence actually is. Such children never want to let anyone see when they\ndon\u2019t understand something, so they don\u2019t ask questions. Mistakes and failures are to be avoided because they\nshow how \u201cdumb\u201d you are, and having to exert extra effort means that you must not be as \u201cnaturally\u201d smart. Since\nevery low performance is considered a shameful failure, individuals with this view tend to prefer tasks that they\ncan already do well and to avoid those where they might have to try hard, or where they might make mistakes.\n\u2022 Growth Mindset (aka an incremental view of intelligence). In this mindset, people view intelligence and abilities as\nexpandable with effort. There is no fixed amount of intelligence that people come with. Instead, there\u2019s just the\nlevel of competence we have currently attained. Everyone can always get \u201csmarter,\u201d through effort, hard work,\npractice, and more effective strategies. In this view, effort expands the capacity to learn, and mistakes are an\nopportunity to learn even more. Such children do not need to worry about whether they \u201cmeasure up;\u201d they focus\ninstead on figuring out how to take the next steps to improve their skills. Since \u201cfailure\u201d is considered an\nopportunity to learn more, individuals with this view tend to prefer tasks that are challenging, even if it means\nthey make mistakes at first, because that is how they will learn the most.\nWhy do mindsets matter?\nEven throughout adulthood, mindsets profoundly affect your life and the way you approach the world. For example,\nthey affect your goals, how you strive to achieve them, and your motivations for pursuing them. They also impact your\ndefinitions of success versus failure and your reactions to obstacles and challenges.\nLearning Goals (associated with a growth mindset). For those with a learning orientation, the goal is to acquire/improve\nnew skills and knowledge. In general, individuals who hold these views enjoy challenges, set high goals for themselves,\nexert high effort, and concentrate on the task at hand. When failure is encountered, they tend to view it as information\nabout how they can improve their performance in the future rather than as an assault on their personal abilities. When\ndealing with obstacles, people with learning goals tend to respond with more determination and persistence, show less\ndistress, and initiate more proactive patterns of action such as planning, studying, and practicing.\nPerformance Goals (associated with a fixed mindset). For those with a performance orientation, the goal is to gain\napproval from others (e.g., the teacher) by demonstrating one\u2019s high ability or hiding one\u2019s low ability. In general,\nindividuals who hold these views often avoid challenge, set less specific goals for themselves, and are easily distracted.\nThey tend to do just enough to get by and experience more self-derogatory thoughts. When dealing with these setbacks,\npeople with performance goals tend to give up quickly, avoid help, ruminate on their failures, and give excuses for their\nperformance.\nCan mindsets be changed?\nIntelligence, Education, & Motivational Development | 241 Absolutely! The key idea of a growth mindset is that we can develop our abiities through effort. Change doesn\u2019t happen\nover night, but beliefs and mindsets can slowly be changed. When you encounter challenge, what can be learned from it?\nIf we can give up the desire to always appear to be \u201csmart\u201d and embrace the struggles and setbacks that are an essential\npart of the learning process (and teach our children/students to do so as well), we will be more likely to pursue more\nchallenging and fulfilling goals, and to become more competent over time.\nIt\u2019s important to note that having a growth mindset doesn\u2019t mean you can never feel bad about things that have gone\nwrong. You can, for a little while. But, feeling bad does not need to keep you from taking the next, growth-minded steps\nof figuring out how to improve in the future and trying again.\nHow can I promote a growth mindset in my children or students?\nFeedback from parents and teachers can play a big role in the development of children\u2019s beliefs about themselves. There\nis a lot of research about how to set up classrooms so that they promote \u201clearning goals\u201d and a growth mindset. Perhaps\nthe most important thing is the mindset of the adult. If a teacher believes that children\u2019s abilities are fixed, then he or\nshe focuses on meauring intelligence, sorting children accordingly, and offering different opportunities to each group.\nParents who label their children as this is my \u201csmart child\u201d and this is my \u201cartistic child\u201d communicate to both of them\nthat their fixed talents have been measured and that they should limit themselves to what they would be good at.\nAdults can help by providing a wide range of learning opportunities (especially in areas that children aren\u2019t already good\nat), accompanied by lots of encouragement for effort, hard work, and practice. When children encounter setbacks, they\ncan benefit from cooperative examination of their mistakes, supportive coaching, and suggestions about more effective\nstrategies for learning. Even subtle things can make a difference: Praising a child for getting a perfect score on an\nexam can send a message about the importance of getting the correct answer the first time (associated with a fixed\nmindset), whereas praising their effort can emphasize the importance of developing and learning (associated with a\ngrowth mindset). Likewise, expressing sympathy at a low performance or encouraging children to drop an activity when\nthey do not excel right away suggests that there is nothing they can do (associated with a fixed mindset), whereas mild\nirritation and support for continued practice can communicate the expectation that children can improve if they apply\nthemselves (associated with a growth mindset).\nReflect on your own development (or the development of someone you know):\n1. What tends to motivate you?\n\u2022 Getting a good grade?\n\u2022 Learning new things?\n2. How do you feel when you make a mistake?\n\u2022 Like an idiot?\n\u2022 Like you are about to learn something?\n3. How do you cope with obstacles and setbacks?\n\u2022 Do you give up?\n\u2022 Do you try harder the next time?\n4. What are your beliefs about intelligence?\n\u2022 Is it fixed?\n242 | Intelligence, Education, & Motivational Development \u2022 Can it change with effort?\n5.

Physical changes associated with puberty are triggered by hormones. Changes happen at different\nrates in distinct parts of the brain and increase adolescents\u2019 propensity for risky behavior. Cognitive changes include\nimprovements in complex and abstract thought. Adolescents\u2019 relationships with parents go through a period of\nredefinition in which adolescents become more autonomous. Peer relationships are important sources of support,\nbut companionship during adolescence can also promote problem behaviors. Identity formation occurs as adolescents\nexplore and commit to different roles and ideological positions. Because so much is happening in these years,\npsychologists have focused a great deal of attention on the period of adolescence.\nPhysical Development in Adolescence\nLearning Objectives: Physical Development in Adolescence\n\u2022 Identify physical transformations in adolescence.\n\u2022 Describe the effects associated with early and late onset of puberty, and how they differ for boys and\ngirls.\n\u2022 Identify three major brain developments in adolescence.\n\u2022 Explain the asynchrony in two of the brain developments and how it is responsible for certain adolescent\nbehaviors.\n\u2022 Explain why sleep is important for adolescents.\nPuberty is a period of rapid growth and sexual maturation. These changes begin sometime between age eight and\nfourteen. Girls begin puberty at around ten years of age and boys begin approximately two years later. Pubertal changes\ntake around three to four years to complete. Adolescents experience an overall physical growth spurt. The growth\nproceeds from the extremities toward the torso. This is referred to as distal\u2013proximal development. First the hands grow,\nthen the arms, and finally the torso. The overall physical growth spurt results in 10-11 inches of added height and 50 to 75\npounds of increased weight. The head begins to grow sometime after the feet have gone through their period of growth.\nGrowth of the head is preceded by growth of the ears, nose, and lips. The difference in these patterns of growth result\nin adolescents appearing awkward and out-of-proportion. As the torso grows, so do the internal organs. The heart and\nlungs experience dramatic growth during this period.\nDuring childhood, boys and girls are quite similar in height and weight. However, gender differences become apparent\nduring adolescence. From approximately age ten to fourteen, the average girl is taller, but not heavier, than the average\nboy. After that, the average boy becomes both taller and heavier, although individual differences are certainly apparent.\nAs adolescents physically mature, weight differences are more noteworthy than height differences. At eighteen years of\nPuberty & Cognition | 247 age, those that are heaviest weigh almost twice as much as the lightest, but the tallest teens are only about 10% taller\nthan the shortest (Seifert, 2012).\nBoth height and weight can certainly be sensitive issues for some teenagers. Most modern societies, and the teenagers\nin them, tend to favor relatively short women and tall men, as well as a somewhat thin body build, especially for girls\nand women. Yet, neither socially preferred height nor thinness is the destiny for most individuals. Being overweight,\nin particular, has become a common, serious problem in modern society due to the prevalence of diets high in fat\nand lifestyles low in activity (Tartamella, Herscher, & Woolston, 2004). The educational system has, unfortunately,\ncontributed to the problem as well by gradually restricting the number of physical education classes in the past two\ndecades.\nAverage height and weight are also related somewhat to racial and ethnic background. In general, children of Asian\nbackground tend to be slightly shorter than children of European and North American background. The latter in turn\ntend to be shorter than children from African societies (Eveleth & Tanner, 1990). Body shape differs slightly as well,\nthough the differences are not always visible until after puberty. Asian background youth tend to have arms and legs\nthat are a bit short relative to their torsos, and African background youth tend to have relatively long arms and legs. The\ndifferences are only averages, as there are large individual differences as well.\nSexual Development\nTypically, this spurt in physical growth is followed by the development of sexual maturity. Sexual changes are divided\ninto two categories: Primary sexual characteristics and secondary sexual characteristics. Primary sexual\ncharacteristics are changes in the reproductive organs. For females, primary characteristics include growth of the uterus\nand menarche or the first menstrual period. The female gametes, which are stored in the ovaries, are present at birth,\nbut are immature. Each ovary contains about 400,000 gametes, but only 500 will become mature eggs (Crooks & Baur,\n2007). Beginning at puberty, one ovum ripens and is released about every 28 days during the menstrual cycle. Stress and\nhigher percentage of body fat can bring menstruation at younger ages. For males, this includes growth of the testes,\npenis, scrotum, and spermarche or first ejaculation of semen. This occurs between 11 and 15 years of age.\nSecondary sexual characteristics are visible physical changes\nthat signal sexual maturity but are not directly linked to\nreproduction. For females, breast development occurs around\nage 10, although full development takes several years. Hips\nbroaden, and pubic and underarm hair develops and also\nbecomes darker and coarser. For males this includes broader\nshoulders and a lower voice as the larynx grows. Hair becomes\ncoarser and darker, and hair growth occurs in the pubic area,\nunder the arms and on the face.\nEffects of Pubertal Age. The age of puberty is getting younger\nFigure 7.5. First time shaving for children throughout the world. According to Euling et al.\n(2008) data are sufficient to suggest a trend toward an earlier\nbreast development onset and menarche in girls. A century ago the average age of a girl\u2019s first period in the United\nStates and Europe was 16, while today it is around 13. Because there is no clear marker of puberty for boys, it is harder\nto determine if boys are also maturing earlier. In addition to better nutrition, less positive reasons associated with early\npuberty for girls include increased stress, obesity, and endocrine disrupting chemicals.\nCultural differences are noted with African American girls enter puberty the earliest. Hispanic girls start puberty the\nsecond earliest, while European-American girls rank third in their age of starting puberty, and Asian-American girls, on\n248 | Puberty & Cognition average, develop last. Although African-American girls are typically the first to develop, they are less likely to experience\nnegative consequences of early puberty when compared to European-American girls (Weir, 2016).\nResearch has demonstrated mental health problems linked to children who begin puberty earlier than their peers.\nFor girls, early puberty is associated with depression, substance use, eating disorders, disruptive behavior disorders,\nand early sexual behavior (Graber, 2013). Early maturing girls demonstrate more anxiety and less confidence in their\nrelationships with family and friends, and they compare themselves more negatively to their peers (Weir, 2016).\nProblems with early puberty seem to be due to the mismatch between the child\u2019s appearance and the way she acts\nand thinks. Adults especially may assume the child is more capable than she actually is, and parents might grant\nmore freedom than the child\u2019s age would indicate. For girls, the emphasis on physical attractiveness and sexuality is\nemphasized at puberty and they may lack effective coping strategies to deal with the attention they receive, especially\nfrom older boys.\nAdditionally, mental health problems are more likely to occur when the child is among the first in his or her peer group\nto develop. Because the preadolescent time is one of not wanting to appear different, early developing children stand\nout among their peer group and gravitate toward those who are older. For girls, this results in them interacting with\nolder peers who engage in risky behaviors such as substance use and early sexual behavior (Weir, 2016).\nBoys also see changes in their emotional functioning at puberty.\nAccording to Mendle, Harden, Brooks-Gunn, and Graber (2010),\nwhile most boys experienced a decrease in depressive\nsymptoms during puberty, boys who began puberty earlier and\nexhibited a rapid tempo, or a fast rate of change, actually\nincreased in depressive symptoms. The effects of pubertal\ntempo were stronger than those of pubertal timing, suggesting\nthat rapid pubertal change in boys may be a more important\nrisk factor than the timing of development. In a further study to\nbetter analyze the reasons for this change, Mendle, Harden,\nBrooks-Gunn and Graber (2012) found that both early maturing\nboys and rapidly maturing boys displayed decrements in the\nquality of their peer relationships as they moved into early Figure 7.6. Emotional functioning changes in puberty\nadolescence, whereas boys with more typical timing and tempo\ndevelopment actually experienced improvements in peer relationships. The researchers concluded that the transition\nin peer relationships may be especially challenging for boys whose pubertal maturation differs significantly from those\nof others their age. Consequences for boys attaining early puberty were increased odds of cigarette, alcohol, or another\ndrug use (Dudovitz, et al., 2015). However, from the outside, early maturing boys are also often perceived as well-\nadjusted, popular, and tend to hold leadership positions.\nThe Adolescent Brain\nThe brain undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. Although it does not get larger, it matures by becoming\nmore interconnected and specialized (Giedd, 2015). The myelination and development of connections between neurons\ncontinues. This results in an increase in the white matter of the brain that allows the adolescent to make significant\nimprovements in their thinking and processing skills. Different brain areas become myelinated at different times. For\nexample, the brain\u2019s language areas undergo myelination during the first 13 years. Completed insulation of the axons\nconsolidates these language skills but makes it more difficult to learn a second language. With greater myelination,\nhowever, comes diminished plasticity as a myelin coating inhibits the growth of new connections (Dobbs, 2012).\nEven as the connections between neurons are strengthened, synaptic pruning occurs more than during childhood as\nPuberty & Cognition | 249 the brain adapts to changes in the environment. This synaptic pruning causes the gray matter of the brain, or the\ncortex, to become thinner but more efficient (Dobbs, 2012). The corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres,\ncontinues to thicken allowing for stronger connections between brain areas. Additionally, the hippocampus becomes\nmore strongly connected to the frontal lobes, allowing for greater integration of memory and experiences into our\ndecision making.\nThe limbic system, which regulates emotion and reward, is linked to the hormonal changes that occur at puberty. The\nlimbic system is also related to novelty seeking and a shift toward interacting with peers. In contrast, the prefrontal\ncortex which is involved in the control of impulses, organization, planning, and making good decisions, does not fully\ndevelop until the mid-20s. According to Giedd (2015), an important outcome of the early development of the limbic\nsystem combined with the later development of the prefrontal cortex is the \u201cmismatch\u201d in timing between the two. The\napproximately ten years that separate the development of these two brain areas can result in increases in risky behavior,\npoor decision making, and weak emotional control for the adolescent. When puberty begins earlier, this mismatch lasts\neven longer.\nFigure 7.7. Blausen.com staff (2014). \u201cMedical gallery of Blausen Medical 2014\u201d. WikiJournal of Medicine 1 (2). DOI:10.15347/wjm/\n2014.010. ISSN 2002-4436.\nTeens typically take more risks than adults and according to research it is because they weigh risks and rewards\ndifferently than adults do (Dobbs, 2012). The brain\u2019s sensitivity to the neurotransmitter dopamine peaks during\nadolescence, and dopamine is involved in reward circuits, so adolescents may judge that the possible rewards outweigh\nthe risks. Adolescents respond especially strongly to social rewards during activities, and they prefer the company of\nothers their same age. Chein et al. (2011) found that peers sensitize brain regions associated with potential rewards. For\nexample, adolescent drivers make more risky driving decisions when with friends to impress them, and teens are much\n250 | Puberty & Cognition more likely to commit crimes together in comparison to adults (30 and older) who commit them alone (Steinberg et al.,\n2017). In addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by oxytocin which facilitates bonding and makes social\nconnections more rewarding. With both dopamine and oxytocin engaged, it is no wonder that adolescents seek peers\nand excitement in their lives that could actually end up endangering them.\nBecause of all the changes that occur in the brain during adolescence, the chances for abnormal development, including\nthe emergence of mental illness, also rise. In fact, 50% of all mental illnesses occur by the age 14 and 75% occur by age\n24 (Giedd, 2015). Additionally, during this period of development the adolescent brain is especially vulnerable to damage\nfrom drug exposure. For example, repeated exposure to marijuana can affect cellular activity in the endocannabinoid\nsystem. Consequently, adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of repeated marijuana exposure (Weir, 2015).\nHowever, researchers have also focused on the highly adaptive qualities of the adolescent brain which allow the\nadolescent to move away from the family towards the outside world (Dobbs, 2012; Giedd, 2015). Novelty seeking and risk\ntaking can generate positive outcomes including meeting new people and seeking out new situations. Separating from\nthe family and moving into new relationships and different experiences are actually quite adaptive\u2013 for adolescents and\nfor society.\nOptional Reading:\nSocial cognitive development during adolescence.\nSuparna Choudhury, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Tony Charman Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience,\nVolume 1, Issue 3, December 2006, Pages 165\u2013174, https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsl024\nAdolescent Sleep\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF; 2016), to function their best, adolescents need about 8 to 10 hours of\nsleep each night. The most recent Sleep in America poll in 2006 indicated that adolescents between sixth and twelfth\ngrade were not getting the recommended amount of sleep. On average, adolescents slept only 7 \u00bd hours per night on\nschool nights with younger adolescents getting more than older ones (8.4 hours for sixth graders and only 6.9 hours\nfor those in twelfth grade). For the older adolescents, only about one in ten (9%) get an optimal amount of sleep,\nand those who don\u2019t are more likely to experience negative consequences the following day. These include depressed\nmood, feeling tired or sleepy, being cranky or irritable, falling asleep in school, and drinking caffeinated beverages\n(NSF, 2016). Additionally, sleep deprived adolescents are at greater risk for substance abuse, car crashes, poor academic\nperformance, obesity, and a weakened immune system (Weintraub, 2016).\nTroxel et al. (2019) found that insufficient sleep in adolescents is also a predictor of risky sexual behaviors. Reasons\ngiven for this include that those adolescents who stay out late, typically without parental supervision, are more likely\nto engage in a variety of risky behaviors, including risky sex, such as not using birth control or using substances\nbefore/during sex. An alternative explanation for risky sexual behavior is that the lack of sleep increases impulsivity\nwhile negatively affecting decision-making processes.\nPuberty & Cognition | 251 Why don\u2019t adolescents get adequate sleep? In addition to\nknown environmental and social factors, including work,\nhomework, media, technology, and socializing, the adolescent\nbrain is also a factor. As adolescent go through puberty, their\ncircadian rhythms change and push back their sleep time until\nlater in the evening (Weintraub, 2016). This biological change\nnot only keeps adolescents awake at night, it makes it difficult\nfor them to wake up. When they are awakened too early, their\nbrains do not function optimally. Impairments are noted in\nattention, academic achievement, and behavior while increases\nin tardiness and absenteeism are also seen.\nTo support adolescents\u2019 later circadian rhythms, the Centers for\nFigure 7.8. Adolescent circadian rhythms change Disease Control and Prevention recommends that school begin\nno earlier than 8:30 a.m. Unfortunately, over 80% of American\nschools begin their day earlier than 8:30 a.m. with an average start time of 8:03 a.m. (Weintraub, 2016). Psychologists\nand other professionals have been advocating for later start times, based on research demonstrating better student\noutcomes for later start times. More middle and high schools have changed their start times to better reflect the sleep\nresearch. However, the logistics of changing start times and bus schedules are proving too difficult for some schools,\nleaving many adolescent vulnerable to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation. Troxel et al. (2019) cautions that\nadolescents should find a middle ground between sleeping too little during the school week and too much during the\nweekends. Keeping consistent sleep schedules of too little sleep will result in sleep deprivation but oversleeping on\nweekends can affect the natural biological sleep cycle making it harder to sleep on weekdays\nCognitive Development in Adolescence\nLearning Objectives: Cognitive Development in Adolescence\n\u2022 Describe Piaget\u2019s formal operational stage and the characteristics of formal operational thought.\n\u2022 Identify the advances and limitations of formal operational thought.\n\u2022 Describe metacognition.\n\u2022 Describe adolescent egocentrism.\n\u2022 Describe the limitations of adolescent thinking.\n\u2022 Explain the reason school transitions are difficult for adolescents.\n\u2022 Describe the developmental mismatch between adolescent needs and school contexts.\nAdolescence is a time of rapid cognitive development. Biological changes in brain structure and connectivity in the\nbrain interact with increased experience, knowledge, and changing social demands to produce rapid cognitive growth.\n252 | Puberty & Cognition These changes generally begin at puberty or shortly thereafter, and some skills continue to develop as an adolescent\nages. Development of executive functions, or cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts\nand behavior, are generally associated with the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The thoughts, ideas, and concepts\ndeveloped at this period of life greatly influence one\u2019s future life and play a major role in character and personality\nformation.\nImprovements in basic thinking abilities generally occur in several areas during adolescence:\n\u2022 Attention. Improvements are seen in selective attention (the process by which one focuses on one stimulus while\ntuning out another), as well as divided attention (the ability to pay attention to two or more stimuli at the same\ntime).\n\u2022 Memory. Improvements are seen in working memory and long-term memory.\n\u2022 Processing speed. Adolescents think more quickly than children. Processing speed improves sharply between age\nfive and middle adolescence, levels off around age 15, and then remains largely the same between late adolescence\nand adulthood.\nFormal Operational Thought\nIn the last of the Piagetian stages, the young adolescent becomes able to reason not only about tangible objects and\nevents, but also about hypothetical or abstract ones. Hence, it has the name formal operational stage\u2014the period when\nthe individual can \u201coperate\u201d on \u201cforms\u201d or representations. This allows an individual to think and reason with a wider\nperspective. This stage of cognitive development, which Piaget called formal operational thought, marks a movement\nfrom an ability to think and reason from concrete visible events to an ability to think hypothetically and entertain what-\nif possibilities about the world. An individual can solve problems through abstract concepts and utilize hypothetical and\ndeductive reasoning. Adolescents initially use trial and error to solve problems, but the ability to systematically solve a\nproblem in a logical and methodical way emerges.\nHypothetical and Abstract Thinking\nOne of the major advances of formal operational thought is the capacity to think of possibility, not just reality.\nAdolescents\u2019 thinking is less bound to concrete events than that of children; they can contemplate possibilities outside\nthe realm of what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent\u2019s increased facility with thinking about\npossibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning (also called top-down reasoning), which leads to the\ndevelopment of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action\nand to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason\nagainst a friend\u2019s or parent\u2019s position. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.\nFormal Operational Thinking in the Classroom\nSchool is a main contributor in guiding students towards formal operational thought. With students at this\nlevel, the teacher can pose hypothetical (or contrary-to-fact) problems: \u201cWhat if the world had never\ndiscovered oil?\u201d or \u201cWhat ifthe first European explorers had settled first in California instead of on the East\nCoast of the United States?\u201d To answer such questions, students must use hypothetical reasoning, meaning\nthat they must manipulate ideas that vary in several ways at once, and do so entirely in their minds.\nThe hypothetical reasoning that concerned Piaget primarily involved scientific problems. His studies of\nPuberty & Cognition | 253 formal operational thinking therefore often look like problems that middle or high school teachers pose in\nscience classes. In one problem, for example, a young person is presented with a simple pendulum, onto\nwhich different amounts of weight can be hung (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). The experimenter asks: \u201cWhat\ndetermines how fast the pendulum swings: the length of the string holding it, the weight attached to it, or\nthe distance that it is pulled to the side?\u201d The young person is not allowed to solve this problem by trial-\nand-error with the materials themselves, but must reason a way to the solution mentally. To do so\nsystematically, he or she must imagine varying each factor separately, while also imagining the other factors\nthat are held constant. This kind of thinking requires facility at manipulating mental representations of the\nrelevant objects and actions\u2014precisely the skill that defines formal operations.\nAs you might suspect, students with an ability to think hypothetically have an advantage in many kinds of\nschool work: by definition, they require relatively few \u201cprops\u201d to solve problems. In this sense they can in\nprinciple be more self-directed than students who rely only on concrete operations\u2014certainly a desirable\nquality in the opinion of most teachers. Note, though, that formal operational thinking is desirable but not\nsufficient for school success, and that it is far from being the only way that students achieve educational\nsuccess. Formal thinking skills do not ensure that a student is motivated or well-behaved, for example, nor\ndoes it guarantee other desirable skills. The fourth stage in Piaget\u2019s theory is really about a particular kind of\nformal thinking, the kind needed to solve scientific problems and devise scientific experiments. Since many\npeople do not normally deal with such problems in the normal course of their lives, it should be no surprise\nthat research finds that many people never achieve or use formal thinking fully or consistently, or that they\nuse it only in selected areas with which they are very familiar (Case & Okomato, 1996). For teachers, the\nlimitations of Piaget\u2019s ideas suggest a need for additional theories about cognitive developments\u2014ones that\nfocus more directly on the social and interpersonal issues of childhood and adolescence.\n\u2022 Propositional thought. The appearance of more systematic, abstract thinking also allows adolescents to\ncomprehend higher order abstract ideas, such as those inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies.\nTheir increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple\nmessages, such as satire, metaphor, and sarcasm. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend\nsarcasm at all). This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and\nideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith,\nfairness, and honesty. This newfound ability also allows adolescents to take other\u2019s perspectives in more complex\nways, and to be able to better think through others\u2019 points of view.\n\u2022 Metacognition. Meta-cognition refers to \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d This often involves monitoring one\u2019s own\ncognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents are more aware of their own thought processes and can\nuse mnemonic devices and other strategies to think and remember information more efficiently. Metacognition\nprovides the ability to plan ahead, consider the future consequences of an action, and provide alternative\nexplanations of events.\n\u2022 Relativism. The capacity to consider multiple possibilities and perspectives often leads adolescents to the\nconclusion that nothing is absolute\u2013 everything appears to be relative. As a result, teens often start questioning\neverything that they had previously accepted\u2013 such as parent and family values, authority figures, religious\npractices, school rules, and political events. They may even start questioning things that took place when they\nwere younger, like adoption or parental divorce. It is common for parents to feel that adolescents are just being\nargumentative, but this behavior signals a normal phase of cognitive development.\nAdolescent Egocentrism\n254 | Puberty & Cognition Adolescents\u2019 newfound meta-cognitive abilities also have an impact on their social cognition, as it results in increased\nintrospection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization. Adolescents are much better able to understand that people\ndo not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to forms of egocentrism,\nor self-focus, in adolescence. Adolescent egocentrism is a term that David Elkind used to describe the phenomenon of\nadolescents\u2019 inability to distinguish between their perception of what others think about them and what people actually\nthink in reality. Elkind\u2019s theory on adolescent egocentrism is drawn from Piaget\u2019s theory on cognitive developmental\nstages, which argues that formal operations enable adolescents to construct imaginary situations and abstract thinking.\nAccordingly, adolescents are able to conceptualize their own thoughts and conceive of other people\u2019s thoughts.\nHowever, Elkind pointed out that adolescents tend to focus mostly on their own perceptions, especially on their\nbehaviors and appearance, because of the \u201cphysiological metamorphosis\u201d they experience during this period. This leads\nto adolescents\u2019 belief that other people are as attentive to their behaviors and appearance as they are themselves (Elkind,\n1967; Schwartz, P. D., Maynard, A. M., & Uzelac, S. M., 2008). According to Elkind, adolescent egocentrism results in two\ndistinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with\nself-consciousness in general.\nImaginary audience is a term that Elkind used to describe the phenomenon that an adolescent anticipates the reactions\nof other people to him/herself in actual or impending social situations. Elkind argued that this kind of anticipation could\nbe explained by the adolescent\u2019s conviction that others are as admiring or as critical of them as they are of themselves.\nAs a result, an audience is created, as the adolescent believes that he or she will be the focus of attention. However, more\noften than not the audience is imaginary because in actual social situations individuals are not usually the sole focus of\npublic attention. Elkind believed that the construction of imaginary audiences would partially account for a wide variety\nof typical adolescent behaviors and experiences; and imaginary audiences played a role in the self-consciousness that\nemerges in early adolescence. However, since the audience is usually the adolescent\u2019s own construction, it is privy to\nhis or her own knowledge of him/herself. According to Elkind, the notion of imaginary audience helps to explain why\nadolescents usually seek privacy and feel reluctant to reveal themselves\u2013it is a reaction to the feeling that one is always\non stage and constantly under the critical scrutiny of others.\nElkind also suggested that adolescents have another complex set of beliefs: They are convinced that their own feelings\nare unique and they are special and immortal. Personal fable is the term Elkind used to describe this notion, which is\nthe complement of the construction of an imaginary audience. Since an adolescent usually fails to differentiate their\nown perceptions and those of others, they tend to believe that they are of importance to so many people (the imaginary\naudiences) that they come to regard their feelings as something special and unique. They may feel that they are the only\nones who have experienced strong and diverse emotions, and therefore others could never understand how they feel.\nThis uniqueness in one\u2019s emotional experiences reinforces the adolescent\u2019s belief of invincibility, especially to death.\nThis adolescent belief in personal uniqueness and invincibility becomes an illusion that they can be above some of the\nrules, constraints, and laws that apply to other people; even consequences such as death (called the invincibility fable).\nThis belief that one is invincible removes any impulse to control one\u2019s behavior (Lin, 2016). Therefore, adolescents will\nengage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving or unprotected sex, and feel they will not suffer any negative\nconsequences.\nIntuitive and Analytic Thinking\nPiaget emphasized the sequence of cognitive developments that unfold in four stages. Others suggest that thinking\ndoes not develop in sequence, but instead, that advanced logic in adolescence may be influenced by intuition. Cognitive\npsychologists often refer to intuitive and analytic thought as the dual-process model; the notion that humans have two\ndistinct networks for processing information (Kuhn, 2013.)\nIntuitive thought is automatic, unconscious, and fast, and it is more experiential and emotional. In contrast, analytic\nPuberty & Cognition | 255 thought is deliberate, conscious, and rational (logical). Although these systems interact, they are distinguishable (Kuhn,\n2013). Intuitive thought is easier, quicker, and more commonly used in everyday life. The discrepancy between the\nmaturation of the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex, as discussed in the section on adolescent brain development\nearlier in this module, may make teens more prone to emotional intuitive thinking than adults.\nAs adolescents develop, they gain in logic/analytic thinking ability but may sometimes regress, with social context,\neducation, and experiences becoming major influences. Simply put, being \u201csmarter\u201d as measured by an intelligence test\ndoes not advance or anchor cognition as much as having more experience, in school and in life (Klaczynski & Felmban,\n2014).\nRisk-taking\nBecause most injuries sustained by adolescents are related to risky behavior (alcohol consumption and drug use, reckless\nor distracted driving, and unprotected sex), a great deal of research has been conducted to examine the cognitive and\nemotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking. In addressing this issue, it is important to distinguish three\nfacets of these questions: (1) whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), (2) whether\nthey make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or (3) whether\nthey use the same processes but weigh facets differently and thus arrive at different conclusions. Behavioral decision-\nmaking theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action.\nHowever, research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than\ndo adults. Adolescents value social warmth and friendship, and their hormones and brains are more attuned to those\nvalues than to a consideration of long-term consequences (Crone & Dahl, 2012).\nSome have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence. For\nexample, without a willingness to take risks, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave\ntheir family of origin. In addition, from a population perspective, is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing\nto take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements typical of the received\nknowledge held by older adults.\nEducation in Adolescence\nAdolescents spend more waking time in school than in any other context (Eccles & Roeser, 2011). Secondary education\ndenotes the school years after elementary school (known as primary education) and before college or university (known\nas tertiary education). Adolescents who complete primary education (learning to read and write) and continue on\nthrough secondary and tertiary education tend to also have better health, wealth, and family life (Rieff, 1998). Because\nthe average age of puberty has declined over the years, middle schools were created for grades 5 or 6 through 8 as a way\nto distinguish between early adolescence and late adolescence, especially because these adolescents differ biologically,\ncognitively and emotionally and definitely have different needs.\n256 | Puberty & Cognition Figure 7.9. Middle school transition involves new freedom, responsibility, and social pressure.\nTransition to middle school is stressful and the transition is often complex. When students transition from elementary\nto middle school, many students are undergoing physical, intellectual, social, emotional, and moral changes as well\n(Parker, 2013). Research suggests that early adolescence is an especially sensitive developmental period (McGill et al.,\n2012). Some students mature faster than others. Students who are developmentally behind typically experience more\nstress than their counterparts (U.S. Department of Education, 2008). Consequently, they may earn lower grades and\ndisplay decreased academic motivation, which may increase the rate of dropping out of school (U.S. Department of\nEducation, 2008). For many middle school students, academic achievement slows down and behavioral problems can\nincrease.\nRegardless of a student\u2019s gender or ethnicity, middle school can be challenging. Although young adolescents seem to\ndesire independence, they also need protection, security, and structure (Brighton, 2007). Baly, Cornell, and Lovegrove\n(2014) found that bullying increases in middle school, particularly in the first year. Just when egocentrism is at its height,\nstudents are worried about being thrown into an environment of independence and responsibility. Additionally, unlike\nelementary school, concerns arise regarding structural changes\u2013 students typically go from having one primary teacher\nin elementary school to multiple different teachers during middle school. They are expected to get to and from classes\non their own, manage time wisely, organize and keep up with materials for multiple classes, be responsible for all\nclasswork and homework from multiple teachers, and at the same time develop and maintain a social life (Meece &\nEccles, 2010). Students are trying to build new friendships and maintain ones they already have. As noted throughout\nthis module, peer acceptance is particularly important. Another aspect to consider is technology. Typically, adolescents\nget their first cell phone at about age 11 and, simultaneously, they are also expected to research items on the Internet.\nPuberty & Cognition | 257 Social media use and texting increase dramatically and the research finds both costs and benefits to this use (Coyne et\nal., 2018).\nStage-environment Fit. A useful perspective that explains much of the difficulty faced by early adolescents in middle\nschool, and the declines found in classroom engagement and academic achievement, is stage-environment fit theory\n(Eccles, Midgley, Wigfield, Buchanan, Reuman, Flanagan, & MacIver, 1993). This theory highlights the developmental\nmismatch between the needs of adolescents and the characteristics of the middle school context. At the same time\nthat teens are developing greater needs for cognitive challenges, autonomy, independence, and stronger relationships\noutside the family, schools are becoming more rigid, controlling, and unstimulating. The middle school environment\nis experienced as less supportive than elementary school, with multiple teachers and less closeness and warmth\nin teacher-student relationships. Disciplinary concerns can make classrooms more controlling, while standardized\ntesting and organizational constraints make curriculum more uniform, and less challenging and interesting. Existing\nrelationships with peers are often disrupted and students find themselves in a larger and more complex social context.\nThis poor fit between the needs of students at certain stages and their school contexts is more pronounced over school\ntransitions, but continues all throughout secondary education.\nAs adolescents enter into high school, their continued cognitive development allows them to think abstractly,\nanalytically, hypothetically, and logically, which is all formal operational thought. High school emphasizes formal\nthinking in attempt to prepare graduates for college where analysis is required. Overall, high school graduation rates\nin the United States have increased steadily over the past decade, reaching 83.2 percent in 2016 after four years in\nhigh school (Gewertz, 2017). Additionally, many students in the United States do attend college. Unfortunately, though,\nabout half of those who go to college leave without completing a degree (Kena et al., 2016). Those that do earn a degree,\nhowever, do make more money and have an easier time finding employment. The key here is understanding adolescent\ndevelopment and supporting teens in making decisions about college or alternatives to college after high school.\nAcademic achievement during adolescence is predicted by factors that are interpersonal (e.g., parental engagement\nin adolescents\u2019 education), intrapersonal (e.g., intrinsic motivation), and institutional (e.g., school quality). Academic\nachievement is important in its own right as a marker of positive adjustment during adolescence but also because\nacademic achievement sets the stage for future educational and occupational opportunities. The most serious\nconsequence of school failure, particularly dropping out of school, is the high risk of unemployment or\nunderemployment in adulthood that follows. High achievement can set the stage for college or future vocational training\nand opportunities.\nReferences\nBaly, M.W., Cornell, D.G., & Lovegrove, P. (2014).

As formal operational\nthinking unfolds, bringing with it adolescent self-consciousness and the ability to reflect on one\u2019s own attributes and\nbehaviors, teens often struggle with the question \u201cWho am I?\u201d This includes questions regarding their appearance,\nvocational choices and career aspirations, education, relationships, sexuality, political and social views, personality, and\ninterests. Erikson saw this as a period of uncertainty, confusion, exploration, experimentation, and learning regarding\nidentity and one\u2019s life path. Erikson suggested that most adolescents experience psychological moratorium, where teens\nput on hold commitment to an identity while exploring their options. The culmination of this exploration is a more\ncoherent view of oneself. Those who are unsuccessful at resolving this stage may either withdraw further into social\nisolation or become lost in the crowd. However, more recent research, suggests that few leave the adolescent period\nwith identity achievement, and that for most of us the process of identity formation continues all during the years of\nemerging and young adulthood (C\u00f4t\u00e8, 2006).\nExploration and commitment. Expanding on Erikson\u2019s theory, James Marcia (2010) identified two key processes of\nidentity development: exploration and commitment. By exploration, he meant the processes though which youth\nimagine, consider, try out, and try on different possible facets of their identity, experimenting with a variety of attitudes,\nlooks, activities, friends, school subjects, and hobbies. If you happen to have photos of yourself at ages 13, 14, 15, and\n16, you may see some pretty big changes in the way you were dressing and acting at those ages. Those different\n\u201cpersonas\u201d you were trying on, that would be a process of exploration. Exploration of different facets of identity may\nalso be staggered over the adolescent, emerging adulthood, and early adult years (and beyond) as you initially work on\nappearance, attitude, and friendships, and then move on to romantic relationships and vocation. Commitment refers\nto a consolidation and acceptance of who you truly are, as you begin to recognize, understand, and feel comfortable\nwith your multi-faceted authentic self, both in its individual facets (e.g., of personality, sexual orientation, ethnic/\nracial, gender identity, and so on) and in an overall picture of how each of those dimensions of identity fit together,\n262 | Identity Development during Adolescence complement each other, and are integrated (e.g., how your sexual orientation fits with your religious beliefs). You can\nsee why the process of commitment is an ongoing work in progress for so many years!\nMarcia identified four identity statuses that represent the four possible combinations of the dimensions of commitment\nand exploration (see Table 7.3). You can think of them as snapshots of where adolescents and young adults are in the\nidentity development process at any given moment.\nTable 7.3 Marcia's Four Identity Statuses\nExploration\nCommitment to an identity Absent Present\nAbsent Identity Diffusion Identity Moratorium\nPresent Identity Foreclosure Identity Achievement\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nThe least mature status, and one common in many children, is identity diffusion. Identity diffusion is a status that\ncharacterizes those who have neither explored their options, nor made a commitment to an identity. Those who persist\nin this identity throughout adolescence and young adulthood have basically not taken on the crucial developmental\ntask of grappling with who they are and who they want to become, so they run the risk of drifting aimlessly with little\nconnection to those around them or having little sense of purpose in life.\nThose in identity foreclosure have made a commitment to an identity without\nhaving explored the options. Some parents may make these decisions for their\nchildren and do not grant their teen the opportunity to participate in these\nchoices. In other instances, teens may strongly identify with parents and others\nin their life and wish to follow in their footsteps. The potential problems with\nforeclosure are twofold. On the one hand, without active exploration, the\nadolescent or young adult may have missed the opportunity to really get to know\nthemselves\u2013 their passions, preferences, and interests in life. Without this\ninformation, they may make a commitment to a (vocational, sexual, political, etc.)\nidentity that is not really a good fit for their true self. On the other hand, even if\nthe identity to which they are committed is authentic, it is possible that, without\nactive and intentional consideration of multiple alternatives, their commitment\nmay not be as strong or durable.\nIdentity moratorium is a status that describes those who are activity exploring in\nan attempt to construct an identity but have yet to make any commitment. This can\nFigure 7.10. Identity development be an anxious and emotionally tense time as the adolescent experiments with\ndifferent roles and explores various beliefs. Nothing is certain and there are many\nquestions, but few answers. As discussed later, identity development is a highly social process, influenced by parents,\nextended family, peers, friends, classmates, teachers, coaches, mentors, social media, and societal messages. For many\nadolescents, aspects of their identity are not necessarily viewed as acceptable by these social partners. For example, an\nadolescent who has a passion for art and theatre is part of an extended family who expects her to go into medicine or\nbusiness. Such mismatches between internal information about who you feel you really are and what the social world\nwants you to be can extend the period of moratorium for specific aspects of identity development, while the adolescent\nor young adult attempts to negotiate and reconcile these mismatches.\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 263 Identity achievement refers to those who after exploration have made a commitment. This is a long process and, as\nmentioned previously, is not typically achieved by the end of adolescence.\nChanges in identity status. During high school and the college years, teens and young adults move from identity\ndiffusion and foreclosure toward moratorium and achievement. The biggest gains in the development of identity\ntypically take place in college, as college students are exposed to a greater variety of career choices, lifestyles, and\nbeliefs. Exposure to so many alternatives is likely to spur questions regarding identity. A great deal of the identity work\nwe do in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and goals, as we strive to articulate a personal vision or\ndream for what we hope to accomplish in the future (McAdams, 2013). During these later periods, emerging adults also\nfocus some of their energy in the task of identity development on achieving more coherence and integration among the\ndifferent facets of one\u2019s identity, striving to fit passions (like music) into a vocation that will support them financially, or\nfinding a balance between family, school, and work.\nEven after an identity has been established, life events during adulthood and even into old age can reignite the process\nof identity development. For example, when a middle-aged man loses his job and it seems as if that line of work is\nbeing phased out, he may begin the process of reimagining a new vocational identity. Or when a middle-aged woman\u2019s\nchildren move out of the house, she may begin to rekindle the parts of her identity that were fascinated by creative\nwriting or building a business. Retirement is a common time for couples to figure out who they want to be and what\nthey want to do in the next chapter of their lives.\nBecause identity development can be considered an ongoing process that we revisit and re-examine at many times\nin our lives, researchers have given this process its own name: MAMA cycling or moving back and forth between\nmoratorium and achievement. This cycling between exploration and achievement is common in identity formation\n(Grotevant, 1987) and considered a normal and healthy process of development.\nWhat is Identity?\nOne of the fascinating things about human psychology is our ability to reflect on ourselves as objects of our\nown thinking. We have seen how this ability makes it possible, starting in early childhood, to have thoughts\nabout the self and to develop a self-concept that includes the \u201cI\u201d self and the \u201cMe\u201d self. In adolescence, our\nthinking about ourselves begins to involve more abstract categories and characteristics. Identity occurs in\nmultiple areas of our life. These domains include academic, religious, ethnic, and social identity. Identity\nencompasses our personal preferences and characteristics and our group memberships.\nIdentity has been described as the individual\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d It has been depicted as a\nmental structure or representation of the self. But identity is only partially about who and what we are. It\nalso includes what we do, what we like, and even how we feel. So identity is more than a mental model. It is\nfull of meanings, emotions, desires, and goals. Identity is only partially stable, because it is also flexible\nacross situations and malleable over time. Identity is somewhat like a thing and a lot like a process. It is our\nconceptualization of a network of associations and mental events that we use to think about and talk about\nourselves and other people.\nThe multiple personal and social identities we hold play out in a variety of domains and situations in\ncomplex ways. One way in which we incorporate the social world into our views of ourselves is through our\npositionality in the social hierarchies in our society. This suggests that a useful approach to understanding\nthis complexity and unraveling some of the interconnections is to examine identity in terms of the\nintersections between aspects of our positions, such as where we fall in terms of race, gender, and class\n264 | Identity Development during Adolescence (Crenshaw, 1989; 1991). From this perspective, it is the intersection among our positions on these\nhierarchies (as well as others, such as immigrant and disability status, age, and so on) that influence our\nexperiences (e.g., the conditions under which we live, the opportunities we enjoy, and how we are treated)\nas well as how we see ourselves (based in part on society\u2019s messages about our value). For example, the\nexperiences of black women may be different in many ways from those of black men. And the experiences of\nrich black women will be different from those lower in socioeconomic status. These experiences involve\noverlapping and interacting systems of social structure and meaning, where layers of identity are not just\nadditive or compounded, but instead create specific niches that are emergent and unique (as well as\nchanging as society\u2019s prejudices and hierarchies shift). The intersectionality approach has been applied in\nresearch on identity processes, antecedents, and consequences, and has resulted in many fascinating and\nunexpected empirical findings.\nSome researchers who study the self insist that it is not a fixed entity or trait at all, but instead a dynamic\nsystem that is held in place partly by our beliefs that it is real. From this perspective, a possible direction for\nidentity development would be to \u201cget over\u201d or \u201ctranscend\u201d the ego-centric idea of a unitary isolated self,\nand expand one\u2019s dynamic agentic presence to connect with other people, the natural world, and the past\nand future. What a mind-blowing idea!\nFacets of Identity Development\nDevelopmental psychologists have researched multiple different areas of identity development. Some of the main areas\ninclude:\n\u2022 Ethnic-Racial identity refers to how people come to terms\nwith who they are based on their ethnic and/or racial\nancestry. \u201cThe task of ethnic identity formation involves\nsorting out and resolving positive and negative feelings and\nattitudes about one\u2019s own ethnic group and about other\ngroups and identifying one\u2019s place in relation to both\u201d\n(Phinney, 2006, p. 119). When groups differ in status in a\nculture, those from the non-dominant group are typically\ncognizant of the customs and values of those from the\ndominant culture. The reverse is rarely the case. This\nmakes ethnic-racial identity far less salient for members of\nthe dominant culture. In the United States, those of Figure 7.11\nEuropean ancestry engage in less exploration of ethnic-\nracial identity, than do those of non-European ancestry (Phinney, 1989). However, according to the U.S. Census\n(2012) more than 40% of Americans under the age of 18 are from ethnic and racial minorities. For many ethnic and\nracial minority teens, discovering one\u2019s ethnic-racial identity is an important part of identity formation.\n\u2022 Cultural/Bicultural/Multiracial Identity. Ethnic minorities must wrestle with the question of how, and to what\nextent, they will identify with the culture of their family and with the dominant culture of the surrounding society.\nPhinney (2006) suggests that people may handle this negotiation in different ways. Some may keep these identities\nseparate, others may combine them in some way, while others may reject some of them. Bicultural identity means\nthe individual sees himself or herself as part of both the ethnic minority group and the larger society. Those who are\nmultiracial, that is whose parents come from two or more ethnic or racial groups, have a more challenging task in\ncurrent society. In some cases, their appearance may be ambiguous. This can lead to others constantly asking\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 265 them to categorize themselves. Phinney (2006) notes that the process of identity formation may start earlier and\ntake longer to accomplish in those who are not mono-racial. For both multicultural and multiracial adolescents,\nthe task of identity development is made more complicated by society\u2019s current difficulty in recognizing these\nidentities as legitimate. Some adolescents are continually asked \u201cNo, which one are you really?\u201d or are categorized\naccording to their phenotypic appearance. Sometimes their identity is challenged if they do not embody the\nprototype of a category (e.g., are not fluent in their heritage language). Luckily, society is starting to shift in its\nunderstanding of multi-ethnic, -racial, and -cultural identities, as seen, for example, in questions about race/\nethnicity, where people are allowed to \u201ccheck all that apply\u201d instead of being forced to select only one category.\nIt is also important to note that those who do commit to an ethnic-racial identity may periodically reexamine\nthe issues of race and ethnicity. It is especially common to do so when you have children, at which time you may\nreflect on the values, history, and traditions of your ethnic and racial heritage that you wish to pass on to your\nchildren. This cycling between exploration and achievement is common not only for racial and ethnic identity\nformation, but in other aspects of identity development (Grotevant, 1987) and as mentioned previously is referred\nto as MAMA cycling or moving back and forth between moratorium and achievement.\n\u2022 Gender identity: Acquiring a gender identity is becoming an increasingly prolonged task as attitudes and norms\nregarding gender keep changing. The roles appropriate for males and females are evolving, and the lack of a\ngender binary allow adolescents more freedom to explore various aspects of gender. Some teens may foreclose on\na gender identity as a way of dealing with this uncertainty, and they may adopt more stereotypic male or female\nroles (Sinclair & Carlsson, 2013). For youth who attend college, exposure to a wider variety of options and role\nmodels may allow them to re-open questions about their own gender identity, initiating further exploration and\nnew commitments.\n\u2022 Sexual identity: According to Carroll (2016), by age 14 most adolescents become interested in intimate\nrelationships, and they may begin sexual experimentation. Many adolescent feel pressure to express interest in\nopposite-sex relationships, even if they are not ready to do so. This pressure can be especially stressful for those\nadolescents who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or questioning their sexual identity. Many non-heterosexual adolescents\nstruggle with negative peer and family reactions during their exploration. A lack of parental acceptance can have\nespecially adverse effects on the gay, lesbian or bisexual adolescent\u2019s emerging sexual identity, and can result in\nfeelings of self-doubt, depression, and alienation. In cases where families are unsupportive, adolescents may seek\nsupport from online communities or wait until they leave home to work on this aspect of their identity. In contrast,\nadolescents whose families and peers support open exploration of their sexual identities have better psychological\nand mental health outcomes.\n\u2022 Vocational identity. While adolescents in earlier generations envisioned themselves as working in a particular job,\nand often worked as an apprentice or part-time in such occupations as teenagers, this is rarely the case today.\nVocational identity takes longer to develop, as most of today\u2019s occupations require specific skills and knowledge\nthat will require additional education or are acquired on the job itself. In addition, many of the jobs held by teens\nare not in occupations that most teens will seek as adults. Rapid changes in the nature of employment, and the fact\nthat most adults will hold multiple jobs over their working lives, also suggest that this identity may be re-\nnegotiated several times over the lifespan.\n\u2022 Religious identity. Adolescence is a time when teens normatively question their participation in religious\npractices. At the same time, most teens end up adopting religious views that are similar to those of their families\n(Kim-Spoon, Longo, & McCullough, 2012). Most teens may question specific customs, practices, or ideas in the\nfaith of their parents, but few completely reject the religion of their families.\n\u2022 Political identity. The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parents\u2019 political beliefs. A new trend in\nthe 21st century is a decrease in party affiliation among adults. Many adults do not align themselves with either the\nDemocratic or Republican parties but view themselves as more of an \u201cindependent.\u201d Their teenage children are\n266 | Identity Development during Adolescence often following suit or become more apolitical (C\u00f4t\u00e8, 2006). Trends in voting among young adults suggest that\nmost of them are questioning whether it is meaningful to participate in the current political system.\n\u2022 Negative Identity. A negative identity is the adoption of norms and values that are the opposite of one\u2019s family and\nculture, and it is assumed to be one of the more problematic outcomes of identity development in young people\n(Hihara, Umemura, & Sigimura, 2019). Those with a negative identity hold dichotomous beliefs, and consequently\ndivide the world into two categories (e.g., friend or foe, good or bad). Hihara et al. suggest that this may be because\nteens with a negative identity cannot integrate information and beliefs that exist in both their inner and outer\nworld. In addition, those with a negative identity are generally hostile and cynical toward society, often because\nthey do not trust the world around them. These beliefs may lead teens to engage in delinquent and criminal\nbehavior and prevent them from engaging in more positive prosocial acts that could be beneficial to society\nDevelopmental Processes in the Task of Identity Formation\nAs we discussed in the class on gender identity, all these features of identity have their start in early childhood,\nas children are taught to make distinctions among identity-relevant categories (e.g., male vs. female or Black vs.\nLatinx) and then locate themselves among those categories. During early childhood, these processes, sometimes called\nidentification, are largely declarative and descriptive, as children figure out who belongs to which \u201cclub\u201d and the\nconcrete differences in club members\u2019 appearance, behaviors, activities, and equipment (e.g., toys, games). Although\nchildren notice differences in valence, status, and privileges, it is as if youngsters are just taking notes and not\nnecessarily reflecting on or evaluating the categories to which they have been assigned or the differences in treatment\nthey observe and experience.\nHowever, as the cognitive developments of formal operations begin to emerge during adolescence, thinking becomes\nmore abstract, psychological, complex, and integrated. With increased skills at perspective taking, adolescents are more\nable to see themselves through the eyes of imagined others, which also makes them more self-aware, self-conscious,\nself-evaluative, and prone to social comparison. It is as if, during the shift to formal operations, adolescents \u201cwake up\u201d\nto these features and categories of identity, and how they are viewed in society. This newfound awareness imbues them\nwith deeply personal meaning, value, and emotion. Depending on the messages that children and adolescents have\nreceived about their attributes and the categories to which they belong, the process of negotiating an identity can be\nmore or less complex and rocky.\nAlthough the development of an identity of one\u2019s own seems like a very personal and private task, it is also highly social,\nshaped as much by external and interpersonal factors as it is by internal intrapersonal ones. In fact, we can say that\nthis task is negotiated at the nexus between internal and external forces. Internally, adolescents have access to their\nhistory of interests, preferences, impulses, proclivities, temperament, and intrinsic motivations, in other words, all the\ninteractions that provide them with information about the nature of their genuine and authentic self. These experiences\nare now evaluated more analytically and translated into psychological constructs, like personality traits or values, that\nare nominated for inclusion into a personal identity. At the same time, this information, much of which is based on\nsocial interactions and experiences, is filtered through the lens of the messages adolescents receive about the salience\nand value of these attributes and identity categories. Society even has opinions about what categories are available for\nuse in constructing identities, for example, as mentioned previously, society is only just catching up with categories\nlike multiracial or multicultural, and multiple genders and sexualities. Close relationships, including relationships with\nparents, siblings, and other family members, play a major role and as children approach and go through adolescence,\npeers, friends, and classmates play increasingly important roles as well.\nStrands of identity development. The task of identity development is complex because it involves the integration of\nthree different strands.\n1. First, adolescents are seeking an identity that is authentic, that is, that reflects their true and genuine self. From\nthis perspective, their identity needs to correspond with information they are receiving about themselves from\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 267 deep temperamental, emotional, and motivational processes\u2013 what they like (to do, play, learn about, read, etc.),\nhow they spontaneously react to various situations, their interests and passions, their gifts and faults. To be\nsatisfying, a personal identity needs to be anchored in what is real and true about an adolescent\u2019s individuality.\nThis first strand could be labeled \u201cWho I discover myself to be,\u201d with the goal of \u201cTo thine own self be true.\u201d\nHow Do I Know What My \u201cAuthentic Self\u201d Really Is?\nIt is not easy to come to know our true selves. By the time we start thinking about these questions in\nadolescence, we already have many years and hundreds of thousands of experiences incorporated into\nour multi-faceted view of who we are. These include information from our true selves, but they are\nwrapped in layers of messages and social evaluations we have experienced and observed.\nWhen people wonder about the nature of their \u201creal\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d self, researchers sometimes send them\nback to photos and memories of their 10-year-old selves. At that age, many of our actual characteristics\nand interests are at the surface, because we have not yet developed the self-consciousness that tells us\nto hide features of who we really are in order to fit in. As adults are doing identity work, they can\nsometimes be aided by photos of their 10-year-old selves, often fully and unself-consciously expressing\na range of opinions, interests, and identities, and bursting with confidence. Photos and memories of\nthat time period can serve as guides about what it might mean to be truly authentic.\nOther people can \u201cget in touch with themselves\u201d through creative acts, like journaling about your\nthoughts and feelings, expressing yourself by writing songs or short stories, painting, reading or\nimprovisational theatre. Another interesting activity is the illustrated discovery journal, where you just\nfind photos, drawings, poems, or sayings that speak to you, and put them into a collage, journal, or\nsketchbook. These images and words, collected for no reason other than you like them, can provide\nwindows that help you get to know yourself better.\nOther people get to know themselves through activities. They look for ways to be involved in the world\nthat seem fun and meaningful, like gardening, building houses for Habitat for Humanity, dropping into\nthe community center and taking a class, or volunteering somewhere. The most important aspect here\nis to look at options until you find something that resonates\u2013 something you really want to do. That\nimpulse saying, \u201cWow, that would be fun, I really want to do that,\u201d can be seen as a message from your\ntrue self. And don\u2019t worry, since your true self is developing too, you will have plenty of time to get re-\nacquainted over and over again!\n2. At the same time however, there is a second strand, now available to adolescents through their new-found\nperspective-taking skills. This set of processes is based on social desirability and acceptance\u2013 what others (real\nand imagined) think about me, my personality, appearance, interests, and societal categories (gender, sexual\norientation, race and ethnicity, class, and so on). This strand involves adolescents coming to grips with the societal\nmessages that they have already learned about these various attributes and categories. Up to now, the catalogues\nof social evaluations children have experienced and observed have been understood as largely descriptive (e.g.,\nsociety likes their girls pretty and their boys strong), but now they are becoming deeply personal and meaningful\u2013\n\u201cAm I pretty enough?\u201d \u201cAm I strong enough?\u201d Adolescents are tasked with constructing an identity that is socially\nacceptable, one that family, friends, classmates, teachers, online communities, and society at large will validate as\n\u201cgood.\u201d If the first strand is labeled, \u201cWho I think I am,\u201d then this second strand can be called, \u201cWho others think I\nam\u201d or more precisely, \u201cWho I think others think I am.\u201d\n3. The third strand of identity is kind of a \u201c35,000-foot view\u201d of both of these strands and how they fit together. It\n268 | Identity Development during Adolescence consists of a summative personal and social evaluation of this whole identity that the adolescent has put together\u2013\n\u201cDo I feel good about myself?\u201d You can see how these three strands can be in tension or conflict, and how fitting\nthem together might require some active negotiation. This is especially true when authentic characteristics of\nchildren (like their sexual orientation, appearance, ethnic background, disability status, or grand passions) are\nstigmatized, devalued, or evaluated by society as \u201cless than,\u201d or even dismissed as non-existent (e.g., gender fluidity\nor transgender identities). Adolescents are faced with an impossible choice: They can either be true to themselves\nor create an identity that is socially valued. Initially it seems that all the options here are problematic. Adolescents\ncan deny or dismiss the parts of themselves that society devalues, leading to a socially-acceptable identity that,\nfrom the adolescents\u2019 internal perspective feels hollow or fake. Unsatisfying and inauthentic. Or they can be true\nto themselves, accept society\u2019s judgements about people like themselves, and conclude that this self they have\nbeen handed is authentic but inferior. In this case, we can say that adolescents have internalized the stigma and\nbiases imposed by families, friends, or society in general.\nHowever, there are other options for healthy identity development. For adolescents to successfully negotiate\nthese dilemmas, they need local social contexts that believe and communicate messages that are very different\nfrom the ones broadcast by society more generally. These are messages such as \u201cgirl power,\u201d the treasure of racial\nand ethnic heritage and tradition, LGBTQ+ pride, disability rights, and the inherent value and worth of all people.\nParents and families play key roles in these efforts, by providing racial and ethnic (gender, sexual, religious,\ndisability, etc.) socialization that counteracts biased messages, instills pride, and teaches children about histories\nof struggle against unjust treatment and discriminatory social narratives. Such socialization allows youth to\nexternalize harmful societal messages, and come to view these characteristics as badges of honor, motivating\nthem to affiliate with similar others and to participate in social justice movements. When families of origin are\nnot supportive, young adults often create their own \u201cfamilies of choice\u201d when they leave home. These families\ncan include older adult mentors and role models, peers and close friends who adore them for exactly who they\nare, and younger adolescents whom they can mentor through processes of identity development. You can see\nwhy social contexts are such integral parts of identity development.\nSocial Factors in the Development of Identity\nTo provide a framework for thinking about social factors, we can turn to contextualist views, like Bronfenbrenner\u2019s\nbioecological model and Spencer\u2019s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory. These models remind us that\necologies are complex and multi-layered. We can begin by considering the important role of microsystems, like families,\npeer groups, and schools. But we should also consider mesosystem forces, and especially, factors from macrosystems\nthat are structured according to societal status hierarchies, such as those based on race and ethnicity, class, and gender.\nWe will review some general information about the crucial roles of parents, peers, and schools. And then consider in\nmore detail the development of ethnic and racial identity, where the best research has been conducted to date on\nthe role of societal status hierarchies. This body of research is relatively recent, because developmentalists, who were\nlargely white, did not recognize the centrality of ethnic-racial identity development. We conclude with some thoughts\non ethnic-racial identity in white adolescents, about which not much is currently known.\nParents. Much of the research on social influences on identity development focuses on caregivers. When all goes\nwell, caregivers are the ones who can, starting with attachment processes, communicate warmth, affection, and\nunconditional love. They get to know a child\u2019s inborn temperament, come to value them as complex interesting\nindividuals, and find ways to provide a good match to their idiosyncrasies and quirks. Through emotion coaching, they\nhelp children develop the vocabulary to talk about their genuine feelings and desires, and work with them to develop\nstrategies for seeing that their own needs are considered while also considering the needs of others. They provide role\nmodels and offer young children opportunities to play, explore their favorite activities, and follow their own interests.\nUsing the idea of the \u201cstyles of parenting,\u201d we can see that adolescents whose parents employ a largely authoritative\nparenting style, will likely have an easier time with the tasks of identity development. These adolescents have generally\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 269 received strong messages of love and support for their genuine selves, while also learning how to follow true moral rules\nand act with kindness, honesty, and responsibility. The role of autonomy support is equally important, as adolescents\nare given both freedom and parental support when they explore different facets of their personal identities.\nIt is also clear that other kinds of parenting may contribute to a rockier process of identity development. Parents who\nare more authoritarian, and do not allow deviation from rigid standards can make it more difficult for children to\nparticipate in the exploratory processes that are so central to this task. Strong negative views of particular identities\n(e.g., sexual orientation, gender, political views) can throw up roadblocks to the adolescent\u2019s authentic self. You can\nimagine that this style of parenting could lead to premature foreclosure when the adolescent just submits to parental\nwishes, or moratorium when youth get stuck in committing to an identity they cannot really endorse. Or even rebellion,\nwhen adolescents then lose some of the close connections with family that can provide them support during this\nprocess.\nSo called \u201chelicopter\u201d parents, who prevent children from taking risks and trying out new things, likewise curtail\nindependence and exploratory activities, thus interfering with key processes of identity development. There are parts of\npermissive or indulgent parenting that may seem like they could facilitate identity development (e.g., warmth, love, and\na philosophy of \u201canything goes\u201d) by encouraging children to do whatever feels right to them. However, as we discussed\nin the lectures on parenting, limits are good for children. Firm and reasonable limits help children learn to get along\nwith others and respect others\u2019 rights. Children with permissive parents tend toward immaturity, self-centeredness, and\nlack of achievement and mastery. These attributes can interfere with the adolescent\u2019s eventual decisions to commit to\nvalues, activities, and relationships that are important parts of identity development.\nFinally, neglectful caregivers, who basically ignore children, undermine the development of the security, self-\nconfidence, and self-knowledge adolescents will need to make good decisions about who they are and who they want\nto become. Sometimes this history can leave adolescents wandering in \u201cidentity diffusion\u201d where they are somewhat\naimless and do not really take ownership for the next steps in their life.\nPeers. Much has been made about the importance of peers to processes of identity development, and for good reason.\nRelationships with friends and with members of peer groups are an important context for the development of identity\nduring adolescence. Communication and interactions with peers provide opportunities to elaborate on possibilities,\nplay out tentative exploration, and test commitments against others\u2019 perspectives. Friendships and peer groups can be\nsafe contexts for exploration, made up of freely chosen and mutually supportive equals.\nPeers are important to all three strands of identity development. In the first strand, the process of self-discovery,\nadolescents communicate honestly with each other within these relationships. By giving and receiving information,\nthey become more aware of the diversity of characteristics, preferences, and viewpoints found among their agemates.\nThrough this communication, they develop clarity about their own characteristics and get a better sense of who they\nare. Research has found that adolescents who have higher quality peer relationships, who interact more frequently\nwith their peers, and are more involved in activities with agemates also experience greater identity development and\ncommitment.\nIn the second strand, as a local social context of being seen, heard, and responded to by others, peer relationships are\ncrucial sources of recognition, validation, and support for autonomy, as well as feedback about social desirability of\nattributes and preferences. Through processes of mirroring and social comparison, adolescents become aware of both\nsimilarities and differences to their own friends and peer groups, and with other agemates. There is a desire to bond\nwith like others and to find affinities, but this does not necessarily lead to blind conformity. Adolescents also embrace\nways in which they are individually distinctive. They have a desire to be unique. The dynamic tension between similarity\nand individuality varies between individuals and changes across development. Most teens seek, to some extent, both\nto fit in and to stand out. Early adolescents are usually more susceptible to peer influence and conformity, while later\n270 | Identity Development during Adolescence in adolescence distinctiveness tends to be more highly valued, even within relationships primarily based on affinity or\nsimilarity.\nIn the third strand of identity development, at the societal level of factors and processes that affect identity\ndevelopment, peers also play a part. Adolescents share their perspectives and react to societal norms, values, lifestyle\nchoices, and social hierarchies within their peer relationships. These interactions affect identity development by helping\nteens clarify their own beliefs and preferences. Peers can also be agents for the impact of negative social forces,\nwhen they express stigma, prejudice, or discrimination. This can come from other non-affiliated agemates in the social\ncontext, and sometimes even from within an individual\u2019s own group.\nAs it has been in relationships with parents, identification is also a process at work in adolescent peer relationships,\nand it contributes to identity formation. Identification involves being drawn to and seeing your potential self in admired\nothers, and then emulating their behaviors and characteristics. A good friend or popular peer group member, for\nexample, may serve as a role model. In connection with the burgeoning importance of social aspects of life at this age,\nadolescent identity development also involves social identification, the valuing and adoption of group behaviors and\ngroup characteristics. Teens often adopt the dress, slang, mannerisms, attitudes, and activities of a crowd, which is a\nlarger group or social category within their school context, or they may jointly emulate values and behaviors from a\nsegment of popular culture.\nSchools. Although we talk more about schools in the section on education, it is important to emphasize here that,\nalthough schools may not always think of themselves as important socializers of identity, they nevertheless play key\nroles in identity construction. They provide experiences, interaction partners, and messages to children about their\nacademic identities (e.g., how smart they are), interests (e.g., writing, robotics, math, music), and vocational identities\n(whether they are college bound or able to hold certain jobs). These experiences happen in and out of class, with\nteachers and classmates, and include after school, extra-curricular, and recreational activities. Schools can facilitate\nidentity development when they offer rich and varied opportunities for exploration that expose children to different\ncommunities of learners and do-ers (e.g., community organizers, professionals, scientists, gardeners, plumbers, child-\ncare workers, creative artists). Especially meaningful are extra-curricular activities with real responsibilities and\nopportunities to take leadership roles.\nMiddle and high school can be tricky places for the healthy development of all students, but they can be especially\nproblematic for adolescents who do not meet all the narrow societal \u201cnorms\u201d endorsed by status hierarchies. Parents\nand educators are often horrified at the vicious social messages that come from adolescents and target other\nadolescents who are perceived to be lower on social status hierarchies. However, if you wonder where adolescents get\ntheir ammunition, adults should examine the higher-order hierarchies of human worth that are currently endorsed by\nthe larger society at this historical moment. Adolescents may be the \u201cpolice\u201d who enforce these rigid values, but they\nare enabled and trained by society at large. It is not an accident that adolescence is a time during which youth start to\nactively question and sometimes reject the social messages that society prescribes about the value, status, and privileges\nassociated with particular personality characteristics, activities, physical appearances, and status categories.\nFor many parents, their goals are to get their adolescents out of these school contexts as soon as possible, to protect\nthem from experiences of bullying and peer discrimination, and to find alternative more supportive subcultures for\nthem in other settings (like creative arts centers or workplaces). For some students, online communities allow them to\nfind like-minded friends and peers, and adults also create social messages, such as the \u201cIt gets better\u201d campaign aimed\nat LGBTQ+ youth. The importance of \u201cschools\u201d continues on after high school, since universities often provide a wide\nrange of role models and opportunities for students to explore and engage in identity development activities. Students\nwho attend rigid narrow high schools are often astonished at the freedoms they find at college, where they can discover\nand explore many facets of their identities through friendships, clubs, and classes. Especially important, they can seek\nout and choose their own \u201cfamily\u201d of adults (teachers, advisors, mentors, etc.) and peers, who encourage them to be\nthemselves and love them for exactly who they are.\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 271 To continue up the layers of social contexts, we turn to the higher-order contexts we have been discussing throughout\nthis class. One area in which a great deal of important theorizing and research has been conducted focuses on a specific\naspect of identity, namely, the development of ethnic-racial identity during adolescence and emerging adulthood.\nStructural Racism and the Study of Ethnic-Racial Identity\nThe study of ethnic-racial identity within the field of developmental psychology has undergone a series of\ntransformations in response to a growing awareness of the social-structural and historical contexts and related\nchallenges adolescents face in negotiating this task. Several perspectives have emerged, with each providing unique\ninsights and generating relevant empirical findings. Three major contributions are: (1) Phinney\u2019s model of ethnic identity\nformation (Phinney, 1990), based on Marcia\u2019s developmental process dimensions of exploration and commitment; (2)\nextended bioecological models inspired by Bronfenbrenner, including Spencer\u2019s PVEST (Phenomenological Variant\nof Ecological Systems Theory), and Garcia Coll and colleagues\u2019 Integrative Model for the Study of Developmental\nCompetencies in Minority Children; and (3) multidimensional conceptualizations, which focus on the content and\nstructure of ethnic-racial identity. An overview of each of these approaches follows. Additional information is available\nin the supplemental readings given at the end of the chapter.\nPhinney\u2019s model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson\u2019s and Marcia\u2019s model of identity formation (Phinney,\n1990; Syed & Juang, 2014). Through process of exploration and commitment, individuals come to understand and create\nan ethnic identity. Phinney suggests three stages or statuses with regard to ethnic identity:\n1. Unexamined Ethnic Identity. Adolescents and adults who have not been exposed to ethnic identity issues may be\nin the first stage, unexamined ethnic identity. This is often characterized by a default preference for the dominant\nculture, or where the individual has given little thought to the question of their ethnic or cultural heritage. This is\nsimilar to diffusion in Marcia\u2019s model of identity. Included in this group are also those who have adopted the\nethnicity of their parents and other family members with little thought about the issues themselves, similar to\nMarcia\u2019s foreclosure status (Phinney, 1990).\n2. Ethnic Identity Search. Adolescents and adults who are exploring the customs, culture, and history of their ethnic\ngroup are in the ethnic identity search stage, similar to Marcia\u2019s moratorium status (Phinney, 1990). Often some\nevent \u201cawakens\u201d a teen or adult to their ethnic group: perhaps a personal experience with prejudice, a highly\nprofiled case in the media, or even a more positive event that highlights the contributions of someone from the\nindividual\u2019s ethnic group. Teens and adults in this stage will immerse themselves in their ethnic culture. For some,\n\u201cit may lead to a rejection of the values of the dominant culture\u201d (Phinney, 1990, p. 503).\n3. Achieved Ethnic Identity. Those who have actively explored their culture are likely to have a deeper appreciation\nand understanding of their ethnic heritage, resulting in progress toward an achieved ethnic identity (Phinney,\n1990). An achieved ethnic identity does not necessarily imply that the individual is highly involved in the customs\nand values of their ethnic culture. One can be confident in their ethnic identity without wanting to maintain the\nlanguage or other customs. The development of ethnic identity takes time, with about 25% of youth from ethnic\nminority backgrounds having explored and resolved these issues by tenth grade (Phinney, 1989). The more\nethnically homogeneous the high school, the less adolescents explore and achieve an ethnic identity (Umana-\nTaylor, 2003). Moreover, even in more ethnically diverse high schools, teens tend to spend more time with their\nown group, reducing exposure to other ethnicities. This may explain why, for many, college becomes the time of\nethnic identity exploration. \u201c[The] transition to college may serve as a consciousness-raising experience that\ntriggers exploration\u201d (Syed & Azmitia, 2009, p. 618). Colleges can facilitate this process by requiring ethnic studies\ncourses as part of their core curricula, and by supporting ethnic studies programs and student centers organized\naround ethnic affiliation.\nExtended bioecological systems models, inspired by Bronfenbrenner. There are two of these models, the first being the\nPhenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST), developed by Margaret Beale Spencer (2006). PVSET\n272 | Identity Development during Adolescence is an identity-focused developmental theory that situates identity formation within the social context, where risk and\nprotective factors act as supports or stressors and create individual vulnerability, based on social position and personal\nexperiences, as well as culture. Individuals play an active role in coping with their perceptions and vulnerability and\nforming identities that make sense in response to their experiences. PVEST is a model of overlapping and interacting\nsystems. PVEST includes the role of individual experiences and perceptions and active responses and sense-making,\nand the reciprocal effects of the individual on their context and future experiences.\nThe Integrated Model of Garcia-Coll and colleagues incorporates the social and contextual factors of position and\nstructure, risk and promotion, and emphasizes the role of adaptive cultures and the family context, as well as individual\nchild characteristics, in the production of various competencies as positive developmental outcomes for minoritized\nchildren and youth (Garc\u00eda Coll, Lamberty, Jenkins, McAdoo, Crnic, Wasik, & Garcia, 1996). The Integrated Model\nincludes ethnic-racial identity as both a component of adaptive cultures and as an important positive outcome of\ndevelopment. A large body of research over several decades has applied these extended bioecological models to the\nstudy of marginalized, minority, and immigrant youth, and produced solid empirical evidence of the importance of\ncontextual factors and individual responses, as well as evidence of the benefits of strong ethnic-racial socialization and\nidentity (Hughes, Watford, & Del Toro, 2016).\nMultidimensional conceptualizations of ethnic-racial identity have their roots in attempts to create scales to measure\nethnic-racial identity. A productive approach has been the five dimensions described by Sellers and colleagues, who\ndeveloped a questionnaire measure of Black racial identity for use in studies of antecedents, consequences, and\noptimizing social programs and interventions (Sellers, Smith, Shelton, Rowley, & Chavous, 1998). This approach focuses\non the structure and content, rather than on the development of ethnic-racial identity. The five dimensions described\nby Sellers and colleagues are:\n1. Centrality or the importance of ethnic-racial identity to self-definition;\n2. Salience or importance of ethnic-racial identity in the situation;\n3. Public regard or perceptions of others evaluations of one\u2019s ethnic-racial group(s);\n4. Private regard or self-evaluations of one\u2019s own ethnic-racial group(s); and\n5. Ideology or beliefs about how the group(s) should behave.\nDifferences have arisen in how these dimensions have been applied to different racial and ethnic groups and how\nthey are considered to be related to developmental processes. For example, the Ethnic Identity Scale, which is widely\nused in the study of multiple ethnicities, includes two subscales, namely, exploration and resolution, that assess the\ndevelopmental process of identity, and a third subscale, affirmation, that assesses evaluative identity content (Uma\u00f1a-\nTaylor, Yazedjian, & B\u00e1maca-G\u00f3mez, 2004).\nThe Ethnic and Racial Identity in the 21st Century Study Group undertook a comprehensive review and\nreconceptualization of racial and ethnic identity that resulted in the publication of a new integrative multidimensional\nconceptualization (Uma\u00f1a-Taylor, Quintana, Lee, Cross, Rivas-Drake, Schwartz, Syed, Yip, & Seaton, 2014). This new\nperspective includes the multiple dimensions of both identity content and developmental processes, and is applicable\nto both racial and ethnic categories. An important contribution of the 21st Century Study Group was to combine the\nconcepts of ethnic identity and racial identity into a single hyphenated construct, referred to as ethnic-racial identity.\nHistorically, the concept of race has been applied to the study of US-born blacks and whites, but it has become clear that\nracial categories are socially constructed when specific characteristics and group affinities are \u201cracialized.\u201d Ethnicity,\non the other hand, is a concept applied to a multitude of groups of people with shared cultural heritage, values, and\ntraditions, and sometimes language, and is transmitted across generations.\nBoth race and ethnicity have consequences for social experience and psychological development. They are often\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 273 overlapping and interdependent. The hyphenated term, ethnic-racial identity, indicates that both race, as racialized\ncategories within society, and ethnicity, as cultural heritage, are relevant, and that they are closely related in terms of\nsimilar processes and outcomes. This perspective underscores the principle of intersectionality, in that it highlights\nthe specificity of ethnic-racial identities as particular combinations of racialized characteristics, ethnicity, cultural\nbackground, and immigration status (Crenshaw, 1989, 1991). It would suggest, for example, that Black adolescents night\nhave very different identities (along with experiences and treatment) if they come from families who have lived in\nthe US for centuries, compared to recent Jamaican or Haitian immigrants. This perspective encourages researchers to\nacknowledge and examine the wide heterogeneity inside groups that up to now may have been combined into categories\nlike \u201cBlack,\u201d \u201cLatinx,\u201d or \u201cAsian American.\u201d\nRequired Reading: Development of a Strong Positive Ethnic-Racial Identity as a Protective Factor for\nChildren and Youth\nThis short paper provides an overview of the importance of positive ethnic-racial identities and ethnic-\nracial socialization for the healthy development of children and youth. These assets protect children and\nyouth from discriminatory experiences and messages, and provide a strong foundation for long-term\nresilience and thriving.\nAbstract. Experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination pose significant threats to the development and\nwellbeing of racial and ethnic minority children. Fortunately, not all youth who experience discrimination\nare susceptible to its harmful effects. Growing evidence points to several racial and ethnic factors that\npromote positive youth development and protect against the potentially damaging effects of racial and\nethnic adversity. This article summarizes emerging research trends and conclusions regarding the\n\u201cpromotive\u201d and \u201cprotective\u201d effects of racial and ethnic identity, ethnic-racial socialization, and cultural\norientation, as well as some of the mechanisms that may account for their salutary properties. The article\nconcludes with a brief discussion of important considerations and directions for the future study of racial\nand ethnic resilience processes in ethnic minority youth.\nNeblett Jr, E. W., Rivas\u2010Drake, D., & Uma\u00f1a\u2010Taylor, A. J. (2012). The promise of racial and ethnic protective\nfactors in promoting ethnic minority youth development. Child Development Perspectives, 6(3), 295-303.\nDo White People Possess an Ethnic-Racial Identity?\nResearchers who study ethnic-racial identity often say that in the US, many white people are \u201cun-racialized\u201d\nin that their race is not a salient part of their identity, and they have not examined or explored their own\nexperiences and treatment through a racial lens. Historically, many white Americans have focused on their\nethnic identity\u2013 they or their ancestors are members of specific immigrant and religious groups, many of\nwhom have experienced oppression and marginalization, including Jewish, Irish, Polish, and Italian\nimmigrants. But white adolescents have typically thought much less about their racial heritage. Dominant\ngroups, who assume that they are the default or prototype group in a given society, often racialize out-\ngroup members (i.e., non-white groups) while resisting the idea that they too have a racial identity. For\nexample, you will notice that African-Americans and Asian-Americans are often referred to using a\n274 | Identity Development during Adolescence hyphenated label, whereas we read much less about European-Americans. Social movements today provide\nwhite European-Americans opportunities to reflect on and construct a racialized identity.\nToday, there are a subgroup of white people who are experiencing a different kind of awareness of their\nethnic-racial identity, based on perceived threats stemming from rapid social change and uncertainty about\nstatus and privilege. Although the source and nature of these experiences may not be readily apparent, we\ndon\u2019t want to underestimate their psychological and social consequences in the lived experiences of real\npeople and those with whom they interact. Experiences of threatened evaluative status of personal and\ngroup identity are familiar to members of marginalized groups. This area has been studied by psychologists\nusing several concepts and theoretical perspectives. One important concept is stereotype threat, which is a\nprocess by which people internalize (usually negative) messages from others about their own subgroups\n(i.e., stereotypes), then when their identity is made salient or they are faced with challenging tasks, those\ninternalized evaluations are triggered. The mental activation of stereotypes (i.e., threat) can have adverse\npersonal consequences, such as increased self-doubt, reduced performance, or giving up. Social\npsychologists have emphasized responses to threat by members of threatened or marginalized groups that\ntake the form of increasing the status of one\u2019s own group (ingroup) or derogating members of other groups\n(outgroup).\nThreats to identity are particularly relevant in adolescence and early adulthood, when identity is\ncrystallizing, and in times of change and transition, either personal or societal. Perceived threat is complex\nand challenging to study when it occurs in the experience of privileged groups. For example, a research\nliterature has emerged focused on the study of threats to masculinity. Some of the research on white\nethnic-racial identity comes under the heading of whiteness studies. Whiteness is a concept that attempts\nto capture the shared experience of the social and historical interpretations and consequences of being\nwhite in a particular society at a particular time. Recently, these lenses have been used to try to understand\nthe appeal a white supremacist identity, which seems to attract some marginalized white youth, especially\nmales who did not complete their education.\nSelf-concept and Self-esteem during Adolescence\nIn adolescence, teens\u2019 self-concepts continue to develop. Their ability to think of the possibilities and to reason more\nabstractly may explain the further differentiation of the self during adolescence. However, the teen\u2019s understanding of\nself is often full of contradictions. Young teens may see themselves as outgoing but also withdrawn, happy yet often\nmoody, and both smart and completely clueless (Harter, 2012). These contradictions, along with the teen\u2019s growing\nrecognition that their personality and behavior seem to change depending on who they are with or where they are, can\nlead the young teen to feel like a fraud. With their parents they may seem angry and sullen, with their friends they are\nmore outgoing and goofier, and at work they are quiet and cautious. \u201cWhich one is really me?\u201d may be the refrain of the\nyoung teenager. Harter (2012) found that adolescents emphasize traits such as being friendly and considerate more than\ndo children, highlighting their increasing concern about how others may see them. Harter also found that older teens\nadd values and moral standards to their self-descriptions.\nAs self-concept differentiates, so too does self-esteem. In addition to the academic, social, appearance, and physical/\nathletic dimensions of self-esteem in middle and late childhood, teens also add perceptions of their competencies\nin romantic relationships, on the job, and in close friendships (Harter, 2006). Self-esteem often drops when children\ntransition from one school setting to another, such as shifting from elementary to middle school, or junior high to high\nschool (Ryan, Shim, & Makara, 2013). These declines are usually temporary, unless there are additional stressors such\nas parental conflict, or other family disruptions (De Wit, Karioja, Rye, & Shain, 2011). Self-esteem rises from mid to late\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 275 adolescence for most teenagers, especially if they feel competent in their peer relationships, appearance, and athletic\nabilities (Birkeland, Melkivik, Holsen, & Wold, 2012).\nParents and Teens: Autonomy and Attachment\nIt appears that most teens do not experience adolescent \u201cstorm and stress\u201d to the degree once famously suggested by\nG. Stanley Hall, a pioneer in the study of adolescent development. Only small numbers of teens have major conflicts\nwith their parents (Steinberg & Morris, 2001), and most disagreements are minor. For example, in a study of over 1,800\nparents of adolescents from various cultural and ethnic groups, Barber (1994) found that conflicts occurred over day-\nto-day issues such as homework, money, curfews, clothing, chores, and friends. These disputes typically occur because\nan adolescent\u2019s desire for independence and autonomy conflicts with parental supervision and control. These types of\narguments tend to decrease as teens develop (Galambos & Almeida, 1992).\nTeens report more conflict with their mothers (than their fathers), as many mothers believe they should still have some\ncontrol over many of these areas, but at the same time teens often report that their mothers are also more encouraging\nand supportive (Costigan, Cauce, & Etchison, 2007). As teens grow older, more compromise is reached between parents\nand teenagers (Smetana, 2011). Teenagers begin to behave more responsibly and parents increasingly recognize their\nneed for autonomy. Parents are more controlling of daughters, especially early maturing girls, than they are sons (Caspi,\nLynam, Moffitt, & Silva, 1993). In addition, culture and ethnicity also play a role in how restrictive parents are with the\ndaily lives of their children (Chen, Vansteenkiste, Beyers, Soensens, & Van Petegem, 2013).\nTeenagers benefit from supportive, less conflict-ridden relationships with parents. Research on attachment in\nadolescence find that teens who are still securely attached to their parents have fewer emotional problems (Rawatlal,\nKliewer & Pillay, 2015), are less likely to engage in drug abuse and other criminal behaviors (Meeus, Branje & Overbeek,\n2004), and have more positive peer relationships (Shomaker & Furman, 2009).\nPeers\nAs children become adolescents, they usually begin spending\nmore time with their peers and less time with their families, and\nthese peer interactions are increasingly unsupervised by adults.\nChildren\u2019s notions of friendship often focus on shared activities,\nwhereas adolescents\u2019 notions of friendship increasingly focus\non intimate exchanges of thoughts and feelings. This increase\nin intimacy, mutuality, and reciprocity characterizes both teen\nfriendships and relationships with members of adolescent peer\ngroups. During adolescence, peer groups evolve from primarily\nFigure 7.12. Peers associate on the basis of similarity single-sex to mixed-sex. Adolescents within a peer group tend\nto be similar to one another in behavior and attitudes, which\nhas been explained as a function of homophily, that is, adolescents who are similar to one another choose to spend time\ntogether in a \u201cbirds of a feather flock together\u201d way. Adolescents who spend time together also shape each other\u2019s\nbehavior and attitudes. Peers serve as important sources of social support and companionship during adolescence, and\nadolescents with positive peer relationships are happier and better adjusted than those who are socially isolated or have\nconflictual peer relationships.\nCrowds are an emerging level of peer relationships in adolescence. In contrast to friendships, which are reciprocal\ndyadic relationships, and cliques, which refer to groups of individuals who interact frequently, crowds are characterized\nmore by shared reputations or images than actual interactions (Brown & Larson, 2009). These crowds reflect different\nprototypic identities, such as jocks or brains, and are often linked with adolescents\u2019 social status and peers\u2019 perceptions\nof their values or behaviors.\n276 | Identity Development during Adolescence Peers and Socially Undesirable Behavior\nPeers can serve both positive and negative functions during adolescence. Negative peer pressure can lead adolescents to\nmake riskier decisions or engage in more problematic behavior than they would alone or in the presence of their family.\nFor example, adolescents are much more likely to drink alcohol, use drugs, and commit crimes when they are with\ntheir friends than when they are alone or with their family. One negative aspect of adolescent peer influence is known\nas deviant peer contagion (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011), which is the process by which peers reinforce problem behavior by\nlaughing or showing other signs of approval that then increase the likelihood of future problem behavior.\nParents and other adults are often concerned about these potential negative influences of peers, which can affect\nbehavior, attitudes, and identity development. Peers can be associated with the adoption of unhealthy or antisocial\nbehaviors, and also with the adoption of negative attitudes toward school, or socially undesirable norms and values.\nOften this is a transient rebellious phase, something some teens go through. But longer term, there is concern that\nthese events may ultimately lead to patterns of antisocial or criminal behavior and identity. The biggest challenge\nfor researchers is to sort out the relative importance of selection and influence in these circumstances. To what\nextent do adolescents select similar others on the same developmental path as themselves, and to what extent are\nthey influenced by those in whose proximity they find themselves? It\u2019s complicated. We are faced with a chicken or\negg problem. Which came first, the bad influence of undesirable behavior by others, or a desire for defiant behavior?\nUnhealthy and delinquent behaviors and negative attitudes toward societal norms and values are preexisting within\nlarger societal contexts and may be freely chosen by some teens, but they are also adopted within local social contexts\nwhere intragroup processes and social influence are at play. Aggressive or rebellious youth sometimes take a leadership\nrole and become role models within peer groups. Individual differences are also at play. Adolescent development in\npeer contexts involves the individual\u2019s own previous personal history. It involves their social experiences of acceptance\nand rejection on different attributes. It overlaps with their negotiation of personal and social identities that make sense\nand work for the individual. Within this complex reality, it is hard to make generalizations about cause and effect. We\ncan, however, share the concern for finding ways to promote optimal development and well-being, and look forward to\ncontinuing research efforts focused on the dark side of peer relationships and adolescent development.\nRomantic Relationships\nAdolescence is the developmental period during which\nromantic relationships typically first emerge. By the end of\nadolescence, most American teens have had at least one\nromantic relationship (Dolgin, 2011). However, culture does play\na role as Asian Americans and Latinas are less likely to date than\nother ethnic groups (Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, & Pepler, 2004).\nDating serves many purposes for teens, including having fun,\ncompanionship, status, socialization, sexual experimentation,\nintimacy, and (for those in late adolescence) partner selection\n(Dolgin, 2011).\nFigure 7.13. Romantic relationships contribute to adolescent There are several stages in the dating process beginning with\nadjustment\nengaging in mixed-sex group activities in early adolescence\n(Dolgin, 2011). The same-sex peer groups that were common during childhood expand into mixed-sex peer groups that\nare more characteristic of adolescence. Romantic relationships often form in the context of these mixed-sex peer\ngroups (Connolly, Furman, & Konarski, 2000). Interacting in mixed-sex groups is easier for teens as they are among a\nsupportive group of friends, can observe others interacting, and are kept safe from a too early intimate relationship. By\nmiddle adolescence teens are engaging in brief, casual dating or in group dating with established couples (Dolgin, 2011).\nThen in late adolescence dating involves exclusive, intense relationships. These relationships tend to be long-lasting and\ncontinue for a year or longer, however, they may also interfere with friendships. Although romantic relationships during\nIdentity Development during Adolescence | 277 adolescence are often short-lived rather than long-term committed partnerships, their importance should not be\nminimized. Adolescents spend a great deal of time focused on romantic relationships, and their positive and negative\nemotions are tied more to romantic relationships, or lack thereof, than to friendships, family relationships, or school\n(Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Romantic relationships contribute to adolescents\u2019 identity formation, changes in family and\npeer relationships, and emotional and behavioral adjustment.\nFurthermore, romantic relationships are centrally connected to adolescents\u2019 emerging sexuality. Parents, policymakers,\nand researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to adolescent sexuality, in large part because of concerns\nrelated to sexual intercourse, sexually-transmitted diseases, contraception, and preventing teen pregnancies. However,\nsexuality involves more than this narrow focus. For example, adolescence is often the time when individuals who are\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender come to recognize themselves as such (Russell, Clarke, & Clary, 2009). Thus,\nromantic relationships are a domain in which adolescents experiment with new behaviors and identities.\nHowever, a negative dating relationship can adversely affect an adolescent\u2019s development. Soller (2014) explored the link\nbetween relationship inauthenticity and mental health. Relationship inauthenticity refers to an incongruence between\nthoughts/feelings and actions within a relationship. Desires to gain partner approval and demands in the relationship\nmay negatively affect an adolescent\u2019s sense of authenticity. Because of the high status our society places on romantic\nrelationships, especially for girls, adolescents sometimes allow themselves to be pressured into behaviors with which\nthey are not really comfortable, and experience tension between their desires to be in a relationship and their need\nto set boundaries in the face of their partner\u2019s wishes or demands. Soller found that relationship inauthenticity was\npositively correlated with poor mental health, including depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, especially\nfor females.\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 This documentary by Shakti Butler explores the school-to-prison-pipeline and the impact of the criminal legal\nsystem on minoritized populations.\nhttps://www.world-trust.org/healing-justice\n\u2022 This article discusses how harsh discipline school policies impact Black girls.\nHines-Datiri, D., & Carter Andrews, D.

More recently, developmentalists have divided this 25 year age period\ninto two separate stages: Emerging adulthood followed by early adulthood. Although these age periods differ in their\nphysical, cognitive, and social development, overall the age period from 18 to 40 is a time of peak physical capabilities\nand the emergence of more mature cognitive development, financial independence, and the establishment of intimate\nrelationships.\nEmerging Adulthood Defined\nEmerging adulthood is the period between the late teens and early twenties; ages 18-25, although some researchers have\nincluded up to age 29 in their definitions (Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, 2016). Jeffrey Arnett (2000)\nargues that emerging adulthood is neither adolescence nor is it young adulthood. Individuals in this age period have\nleft behind the relative dependency of childhood and adolescence but have not yet taken on the responsibilities of\nadulthood. \u201cEmerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about\nthe future is decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life\u2019s possibilities is greater for most\npeople than it will be at any other period of the life course\u201d (Arnett, 2000, p. 469). Arnett identified five characteristics\nof emerging adulthood that distinguish it from adolescence and young adulthood (Arnett, 2006).\n1. It is the age of identity exploration. In 1950, Erik Erikson proposed that it was during adolescence that humans\nwrestled with the question of identity. Yet, even Erikson (1968) commented on a trend during the 20th century of a\n\u201cprolonged adolescence\u201d in industrialized societies. Today, most identity development occurs during the late teens\nand early twenties rather than adolescence. It is during emerging adulthood that people are exploring their career\nchoices and ideas about intimate relationships, setting the foundation for adulthood.\n2. Arnett also described this time period as the age of instability (Arnett, 2000; Arnett, 2006). Exploration generates\nuncertainty and instability. Emerging adults change jobs, relationships, and residences more frequently than other\nage groups.\n3. This is also the age of self-focus. Being self-focused is not the same as being \u201cself-centered.\u201d Adolescents are more\nself-centered than emerging adults. Arnett reports that in his research, he found emerging adults to be very\nconsiderate of the feelings of others, especially their parents. They now begin to see their parents as people not\njust parents, something most adolescents fail to do (Arnett, 2006). Nonetheless, emerging adults focus more on\nthemselves, as they realize that they have few obligations to others and that this is the time where they can do\nwhat they want with their life.\n4. This is also the age of feeling in-between. When asked if they feel like adults, more 18 to 25 year-olds answer \u201cyes\nand no\u201d than do teens or adults over the age of 25 (Arnett, 2001). Most emerging adults have gone through the\nchanges of puberty, are typically no longer in high school, and many have also moved out of their parents\u2019 home.\nThus, they no longer feel as dependent as they did as teenagers. Yet, they may still be financially dependent on\ntheir parents to some degree, and they have not completely attained some of the indicators of adulthood, such as\nfinishing their education, obtaining a good full-time job, being in a committed relationship, or being responsible\nfor others. It is not surprising that Arnett found that 60% of 18 to 25 year-olds felt that in some ways they were\nadults, but in some ways, they were not (Arnett, 2001).\n284 | Emerging Adulthood & Cognition 5. Emerging adulthood is the age of possibilities. It is a time period of optimism as more 18 to 25 year-olds feel that\nthey will someday get to where they want to be in life. Arnett (2000, 2006) suggests that this optimism is because\nthese dreams have yet to be tested. For example, it is easier to believe that you will eventually find your soul mate\nwhen you have yet to have had a serious relationship. It may also be a chance to change directions, for those\nwhose lives up to this point have been difficult. The experiences of children and teens are influenced by the\nchoices and decisions of their parents. If the parents are dysfunctional, there is little a child can do about it. In\nemerging adulthood, however, people can move out and move on. They have the chance to transform their lives\nand move away from unhealthy environments. Even those whose lives were happy and fulfilling as children, now\nhave the opportunity in emerging adulthood to become independent and make their own decisions about the\ndirection they would like their lives to take.\nSocioeconomic Class and Emerging Adulthood. The theory of emerging adulthood was initially criticized as only\nreflecting upper middle-class, college-attending young adults in the United States and not those who were working\nclass or poor (Arnett, 2016). Consequently, Arnett reviewed results from the 2012 Clark University Poll of Emerging\nAdults, whose participants were demographically similar to the United States population. Results primarily indicated\nconsistencies across aspects of the theory, including positive and negative perceptions of the time-period and views\non education, work, love, sex, and marriage. Two significant differences were found, the first being that emerging\nadults from lower socioeconomic classes identified more negativity in their emotional lives, including higher levels of\ndepression. Secondly, those in the lowest socioeconomic group were more likely to agree that they had not been able\nto find sufficient financial support to obtain the education they believed they needed. Overall, Arnett concluded that\nemerging adulthood exists wherever there is a period between the end of adolescence and entry into adult roles, but\nalso acknowledged that social, cultural, and historical contexts were important.\nCross-cultural Variations. The five features proposed in the theory of emerging adulthood originally were based on\nresearch involving Americans between ages 18 and 29 from various ethnic groups, social classes, and geographical\nregions (Arnett, 2004, 2016). To what extent does the theory of emerging adulthood apply internationally?\nThe answer to this question depends greatly on what part of the world is considered. Demographers make a useful\ndistinction between the developing countries that comprise the majority of the world\u2019s population and the economically\ndeveloped countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including\nthe United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. The current population of\nOECD countries (also called developed countries) is 1.2 billion, about 18% of the total world population (United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, 2011). The rest of the population resides in developing countries, which have much lower\nmedian incomes, much lower median educational attainment, and much higher incidence of illness, disease, and early\ndeath. Let us consider emerging adulthood in other OECD countries as little is known about the experiences of 18-25\nyear-olds in developing countries.\nThe same demographic changes as described above for the United States have taken place in other OECD countries\nas well. This is true of increasing participation in postsecondary education, as well as increases in the median ages\nfor entering marriage and parenthood (UNdata, 2010). However, there is also substantial variability in how emerging\nadulthood is experienced across OECD countries. Europe is the region where emerging adulthood is longest and most\nleisurely. The median ages for entering marriage and parenthood are near 30 in most European countries (Douglass,\n2007). Europe today is the location of the most affluent, generous, and egalitarian societies in the world, in fact, in\nhuman history (Arnett, 2007). Governments pay for tertiary education, assist young people in finding jobs, and provide\ngenerous unemployment benefits for those who cannot find work. In northern Europe, many governments also provide\nhousing support. Emerging adults in European societies make the most of these advantages, gradually making their way\nto adulthood during their twenties while enjoying travel and leisure with friends.\nThe lives of emerging adults in developed Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea, are in some ways similar\nto the lives of emerging adults in Europe and in some ways strikingly different. Like European emerging adults, Asian\nEmerging Adulthood & Cognition | 285 emerging adults tend to enter marriage and parenthood around age 30 (Arnett, 2011). Like European emerging adults,\nAsian emerging adults in Japan and South Korea enjoy the benefits of living in affluent societies with generous social\nwelfare systems that provide support for them in making the transition to adulthood, including free university education\nand substantial unemployment benefits.\nHowever, in other ways, the experience of emerging adulthood in Asian OECD countries is markedly different than in\nEurope. Europe has a long history of individualism, and today\u2019s emerging adults carry that legacy with them in their\nfocus on self-development and leisure during emerging adulthood. In contrast, Asian cultures have a shared cultural\nhistory emphasizing collectivism and family obligations.\nAlthough Asian cultures have become more individualistic\nin recent decades, as a consequence of globalization, the\nlegacy of collectivism persists in the lives of emerging\nadults. They pursue identity explorations and self-\ndevelopment during emerging adulthood, like their\nAmerican and European counterparts, but within\nnarrower boundaries set by their sense of obligations to\nothers, especially their parents (Phinney & Baldelomar,\n2011). For example, in their views of the most important\ncriteria for becoming an adult, emerging adults in the\nUnited States and Europe consistently rank financial\nindependence among the most important markers of\nFigure 8.1. Is your culture one that promotes romantic relationships\nadulthood. In contrast, emerging adults with an Asian\nfor emerging adults? Or does it encourage you to wait till you\u2019re\ncultural background especially emphasize becoming older? What would it be like to live in the opposite culture?\ncapable of supporting parents financially as among the\nmost important criteria (Arnett, 2003; Nelson, Badger, & Wu, 2004). This sense of family obligation may curtail their\nidentity explorations in emerging adulthood to some extent, and compared to emerging adults in the West, they pay\nmore heed to their parents\u2019 wishes about what they should study, what job they should take, and where they should live\n(Rosenberger, 2007).\nWhen Does Adulthood Begin? According to Rankin and Kenyon (2008), in years past the process of becoming an adult\nwas more clearly marked by rites of passage. For many, marriage and parenthood were considered entry into adulthood.\nHowever, these role transitions are no longer considered the important markers of adulthood (Arnett, 2001). Economic\nand social changes have resulted in more young adults attending college (Rankin & Kenyon, 2008) and delaying marriage\nand having children (Arnett & Taber, 1994; Laursen & Jensen-Campbell, 1999) Consequently, current research has found\nfinancial independence and accepting responsibility for oneself to be the most important markers of adulthood in\nWestern culture across age (Arnett, 2001) and ethnic groups (Arnett, 2004).\nIn looking at college students\u2019 perceptions of adulthood, Rankin and Kenyon (2008) found that some students still view\nrites of passage as important markers. College students who placed more importance on role transition markers, such\nas parenthood and marriage, belonged to a fraternity/sorority, were traditionally aged (18\u201325), belonged to an ethnic\nminority, were of a traditional marital status (i.e., not cohabitating), or belonged to a religious organization, particularly\nfor men. These findings supported the view that people holding collectivist or more traditional values place more\nimportance on role transitions as markers of adulthood. In contrast, older college students and those cohabitating did\nnot value role transitions as markers of adulthood as strongly.\nYoung Adults Living Arrangements. In 2014, for the first time in more than 130 years, adults 18 to 34 were more likely to\nbe living in their parents\u2019 home than they were to be living with a spouse or partner in their own household (Fry, 2016).\nThe current trend is that young Americans are not choosing to settle down romantically before age 35. Since 1880, living\n286 | Emerging Adulthood & Cognition with a romantic partner was the most common living arrangement among young adults. In 1960, 62% of America\u2019s 18- to\n34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, while only 20% were living with their parents.\nBy 2014, 31.6% of early adults were living with a spouse or\npartner in their own household, while 32.1% were living in the\nhome of their parent(s). Another 14% of early adults lived\nalone, were a single parent, or lived with one or more\nroommates. The remaining 22% lived in the home of another\nfamily member (such as a grandparent, in-law, or sibling), a\nnon-relative, or in group quarters (e.g., college dormitories).\nComparing ethnic groups, 36% of black and Hispanic early\nadults lived at home, while 30% of white young adults lived at\nhome.\nAs can be seen in Figure 20.2, gender differences in living\narrangements were also noted in that young men were living\nwith parents at a higher rate than young women. In 2014, 35%\nof young men were residing with their parents, while 28%\nwere living with a spouse or partner in their own household.\nYoung women were more likely to be living with a spouse or\npartner (35%) than living with their parents (29%).\nAdditionally, more young women (16%) than young men (13%)\nwere heading up a household without a spouse or partner,\nprimarily because women are more likely to be single parents\nliving with their children. Lastly, young men (25%) were more\nlikely than young women (19%) to be living in the home of\nanother family member, a non-relative, or in some type of\ngroup quarters (Fry, 2016).\nWhat are some factors that help explain these changes in\nliving arrangements? First, early adults are increasingly\npostponing marriage or choosing not to marry or cohabitate.\nLack of employment and lower wages have especially\ncontributed to males residing with their parents. Men who\nare employed are less likely to live at home. Wages for young\nmen (adjusting for inflation) have been falling since 1970 and\ncorrelate with the rise in young men living with their parents.\nThe recent recession and recovery (2007-present) has also\ncontributed to the increase in early adults living at home.\nCollege enrollments increased during the recession, which\nfurther increased early adults living at home. However, once\nearly adults possess a college degree, they are more likely to\nestablish their own households (Fry, 2016).\nFigure 8.2\nCognitive Development in Early Adulthood\nEmerging adulthood brings with it the consolidation of formal operational thought, and the continued integration of the\nEmerging Adulthood & Cognition | 287 parts of the brain that serve emotion, social processes, and planning and problem solving. As a result, rash decisions\nand risky behavior decrease rapidly across early adulthood. Increases in epistemic cognition are also seen, as young\nadults\u2019 meta-cognition, or thinking about thinking, continues to grow, especially young adults who continue with their\nschooling.\nPerry\u2019s Scheme. One of the first theories of cognitive development in early adulthood originated with William Perry\n(1970), who studied undergraduate students at Harvard University. Perry noted that over the course of students\u2019\ncollege years, cognition tended to shift from dualism (absolute, black and white, right and wrong type of thinking)\nto multiplicity (recognizing that some problems are solvable and some answers are not yet known) to relativism\n(understanding the importance of the specific context of knowledge\u2014it\u2019s all relative to other factors). Similar to Piaget\u2019s\nformal operational thinking in adolescence, this change in thinking in early adulthood is affected by educational\nexperiences.\nTable 8.1 Stages of Perry's Scheme\nStage Summary of Position in Perry\u2019s Scheme Basic Example\nDualism\nThe authorities know \u201cthe tutor knows what is right and wrong\u201d\nThe true authorities are right, the others are\n\u201cmy tutor doesn\u2019t know what is right and wrong but others do\u201d\nfrauds\nThere are some uncertainties and the\n\u201cmy tutors don\u2019t know, but somebody out there is trying to find\nauthorities are working on them to find the\nout\u201d\ntruth\nMultiplicity\n(a) Everyone has the right to their own opinion \u201cdifferent tutors think different things\u201d\n(b) The authorities don\u2019t want the right answers.\n\u201cthere is an answer that the tutors want and we have to find it\u201d\nThey want us to think in a certain way\n\u201cthere are no right and wrong answers, it depends on the\nEverything is relative but not equally valid\nsituation, but some answers might be better than others\u201d\nYou have to make your own decisions \u201cwhat is important is not what the tutor thinks but what I think\u201d\nRelativism\nFirst commitment \u201cfor this particular topic I think that\u2026.\u201d\nSeveral Commitments \u201cfor these topics I think that\u2026.\u201d\nBelieve own values, respect others, be ready to \u201cI know what I believe in and what I think is valid, others may\nlearn think differently and I\u2019m prepared to reconsider my views\u201d\nAdapted from Lifespan Development by Lumen Learning\nSome researchers argue that a qualitative shift in cognitive development tales place for some emerging adults during\ntheir mid to late twenties. As evidence, they point to studies documenting continued integration and focalization of\nbrain functioning, and studies suggesting that this developmental period often represents a turning point, when young\nadults engaging in risky behaviors (e.g., gang involvement, substance abuse) or an unfocused lifestyle (e.g., drifting from\njob to job or relationship to relationship) seem to \u201cwake up\u201d and take ownership for their own development. It is a\ncommon point for young adults to make decisions about completing or returning to school, and making and following\nthrough on decisions about vocation, relationships, living arrangements, and lifestyle. Many young adults can actually\nremember these turning points as a moment when they could suddenly \u201csee\u201d where they were headed (i.e., the likely\noutcomes of their risky behaviors or apathy) and actively decided to take a more self-determined pathway.\n288 | Emerging Adulthood & Cognition Optional Reading: Current Trends in Post-secondary Education\nAccording to the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) (2016a, 2016b,\n2016c, 2016d), in the United States:\n\u2022 84% of 18 to 24 year olds and 88% of those 25 and older have a high school diploma or its equivalent\n\u2022 36% of 18 to 24 year olds and 7% of 25 to 49 year olds attend college\n\u2022 59% of those 25 and older have completed some college\n\u2022 32.5% of those 25 and older have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, with slightly more women (33%) than\nmen (32%) holding a college degree (Ryan & Bauman, 2016).\nThe rate of college attainment has grown more slowly in the United States than in a number of other\nnations in recent years (OCED, 2014). This may be due to fact that the cost of attaining a degree is higher in\nthe U.S. than in most other nations.\nIn 2017, 65% of college seniors who graduated from private and public nonprofit colleges had student loan\ndebt, and nationally owed an average of $28,650, a 1% decline from 2016 (The Institute for College Access &\nSuccess (TICAS), 2018).\nAccording to the most recent TICAS annual report, the rate of debt varied widely across states, as well as\nbetween colleges. The after graduation debt ranged from $18,850 in Utah to $38,500 in Connecticut. Low-\ndebt states are mainly in the West, and high-debt states in the Northeast. In recent years there has been a\nconcern about students carrying more debt and being more likely to default when attending for-profit\ninstitutions. In 2016, students at for-profit schools borrowed an average of $39,900, which was 41% higher\nthan students at non-profit schools that year. In addition, 30% of students attending for-profit colleges\ndefault on their federal student loans. In contrast, the default level of those who attended public institutions\nis only 4% (TICAS, 2018).\nCollege student debt has become a key political issue at both the state and federal level, and some states\nhave been taking steps to increase spending and grants to help students with the cost of college. However,\n15% of the Class of 2017\u2019s college debt was owed to private lenders (TICAS, 2018). Such debt has less\nconsumer protection, fewer options for repayment, and is typically negotiated at a higher interest rate. See\nTable 7.1 for a debt comparison of 6 U.S. States.\nGraduate School: Larger amounts of student debt actually occur at the graduate level (Kreighbaum, 2019). In\n2019, the highest average debts were concentrated in the medical fields. Average median debt for graduate\nprograms included:\n\u2022 $42,335 for a master\u2019s degree\n\u2022 $95,715 for a doctoral degree\n\u2022 $141,000 for a professional degree\nWorldwide, over 80% of college educated adults are employed, compared with just over 70% of those with a\nEmerging Adulthood & Cognition | 289 high school or equivalent diploma, and only 60% of those with no high school diploma (OECD, 2015). Those\nwith a college degree will earn more over the course of their life time. Moreover, the benefits of college\neducation go beyond employment and finances. The OECD found that around the world, adults with higher\neducational attainment were more likely to volunteer, felt they had more control over their lives, and thus\nwere more interested in the world around them. Studies of U.S. college students find that they gain a more\ndistinct identity and become more socially competent and less dogmatic and ethnocentric compared to\nthose not in college (Pascarella, 2006).\nIs college worth the time and investment? College is certainly a substantial investment each year, with the\nfinancial burden falling on students and their families in the U.S., and covered mainly by the government in\nmany other nations. Nonetheless, the benefits both to the individual and the society outweighs the initial\ncosts.

The process of defining occupational goals and launching a\ncareer are challenging, and involve a whole series of decisions and actions that culminate in most people settling into a\njob or profession sometime during their twenties. Like so many developmental processes, this one starts at a very young\nage, proceeds through several typical steps, and can take a variety of pathways. Work represents a crucial life domain,\nand plays an important role all during middle and late adulthood, potentially influencing psychological and economic\nwell-being, sense of purpose, cognitive and social development, and how the psychosocial task of generativity versus\nstagnation will be negotiated during middle adulthood.\nAs young adults will tell you, it can be challenging to find meaningful work that (1) fits well with your own passions\nand strengths; (2) allows you to independently support yourself; and (3) can be integrated with other commitments,\nlike family, friends, children, and recreational pastimes. Many factors at the personal, interpersonal, and societal levels\ncontribute to this process, and make vocational decision-making easier or harder. Many young people are confronted\nwith discrimination and exclusion as they negotiate this process. Status hierarchies organized around class, ethnicity,\ngender, and other socially-assigned categories produce inequities in college attendance, employment opportunities,\nand levels of pay. Macrosystem factors, like historical changes in the cost of college, the national economic outlook (e.g.,\nthe Great Recessions of 2008 and 2020), and the changing job market, also play big roles. For example, compared to their\ngrandparents, youth of today are much more likely to hold multiple kinds of jobs over their lifetimes, making vocational\ndevelopment more than ever a lifelong process.\nDevelopment of Vocational Decision-making\nLike many aspects of identity development, selecting a work role is a gradual process that begins in early childhood. It\nVocational Development | 293 is complex and includes factors highlighted by multiple meta-theories: (1) as suggested by maturational meta-theorists,\nit involves people\u2019s intrinsic interests and talents; (2) consistent with mechanistic metatheories, it is also shaped by\nprocesses of social learning and socialization (i.e., expectations, demands, and rewards of the local and distal social\ncontext); and (3) as organismic meta-theories remind us, the cognitive processes employed by children youth, and young\nadults show qualitative shifts, meaning that their understanding, decision making, and participation in this process show\nregular age-graded changes. Hence, a contextual lifespan developmental approach which incorporates all these factors,\nas well as the historical and social forces mentioned previously, provides a good framework for thinking about processes\nof vocational development. Major theories hold that children and youth normatively move through three age-graded\nperiods along this pathway (Gottfredson, 2005; Super, 1990, 1994).\n1. Fantasy period. Starting in early childhood, young children become aware of the world of work, and the options\nand status connected to particular vocations. Across early and middle childhood, children explore job options\nlargely through imagination and fantasy (Howard & Walsh, 2010). Using pretend play, stories, discussions about the\nfuture, and even their choice of Halloween costumes, young children try out a variety of occupations, selecting\nones with which they are familiar that sound exciting and fun. In answer to the question \u201cWhat do you want to be\nwhen you grow up?\u201d, young children are likely to name the jobs held by their families and neighbors, or exciting or\nhigh-status jobs, like firefighter and rock star. But they are just as likely to select imaginary options, like superhero,\ndragon keeper, or quidditch player. For most young children, these initial preferences provide a window on the\nchild\u2019s socialization experiences and have little to do with the decisions they will eventually make.\nPreparing Young Children for the World of Work\nTwo ways that parents can help prepare young children for the world of work are (1) encouraging them\nto help out with chores around the house starting when they are toddlers, and (2) giving them their\nown money to manage in the form of an allowance, starting at the age of 3 or 4 years old. Many middle\nclass parents underestimate children\u2019s ability to participate fully in these activities at such young ages,\nbut if parents have the patience to allow toddlers to really help out when they are most interested in\ndoing so, they can reap the reward of children\u2019s continuing willingness and pride in taking on family\nresponsibilities, as described in this article on How to Get your Kids to Do Chores. And if children\nmanage their own allowances starting at a young age, they learn more quickly about saving money and\nmaking informed decisions about spending.\n2. Tentative period. Starting at the end of middle childhood, with the onset of formal operations, adolescents begin\nto understand vocational decision making in more complex ways. Between the ages of 11 and 16, as young\nadolescents are working on the task of identity development more generally, they begin to think about their own\npart in the vocational equation: (1) what they like to do (i.e., their interests, passions, and values); and (2) what they\nare good at. Advances in cognition at this age bring with it an increased capacity for social comparison, and youth\nbegin to evaluate how their skills and abilities in specific areas stack up compared to those of their agemates.\nIncreasing understanding of the requirements of certain jobs provides a template for understanding whether\nparticular vocational pathways are likely to be options for them. Unfortunately, this is the same age at which\nmessages from teachers and from society at large (about who is smart enough or good enough at math and\nscience) can discourage youth (especially young women and adolescents from ethnic minority backgrounds) from\npursuing careers that require advanced training or degrees. In conversations with youth about their future\ncareers, parents and other adults can hear the complexity of their considerations. For example, at the end of high\nschool Leona says, \u201cOn the one hand, I really do love music, writing songs is such a comfort when I\u2019m down. I can\nplay 3 or 4 instruments and I want to play in a band forever. On the other hand, I sure enjoy kids, babysitting is\n294 | Vocational Development such fun. I wish all kids could make music together. Maybe I\u2019ll be a music teacher or work at the Rock and Roll\nCamp for Girls.\u201d\n3. Realistic period. Starting in their late teens and early twenties, youth consolidate their own side of the vocational\nequation (i.e., their interests, abilities, and values), and begin figuring out how these fit with the occupational\noptions provided in their geographic region. Society\u2019s side of the vocational equation is grounded in hard practical\nand economic realities of the job market: what kinds of work society will pay you to do. During this period, youth\nlearn about the categories of jobs that are available, how hard they are to get, and the qualifications needed to be\neligible for specific careers. Some of these realizations come from the school of hard knocks, as teenagers look at\nthe jobs that their family members and neighbors hold and as they themselves apply for summer or after-school\njobs. This is the period of vocational development when occupational search begins in earnest.\nA first step during this period is further exploration, when youth gather more information about how a range of\npotential careers might align with their personal preferences. If young adults are in college (about 70% of high\nschool graduates enroll), this might include taking a variety of courses that interest them to investigate potential\nmajors, talking to other students and career advisors, joining clubs and participating in extracurricular activities,\nseeking out internships, or volunteering at nonprofits or other organizations. In the final phase, crystallization,\nyoung adults settle on a general occupational category, and then experiment further until they decide on a\nspecific job (Stringer, Kerpelman, & Skorikov, 2011).\nThe Realistic period can be discouraging for youth from low income and ethnic minority families, who may\nencounter diminished educational and employment opportunities, and discrimination in college admissions and\nhiring. Status hierarchies organized around class (wealth and education, or socioeconomic status, SES) mean that\nthe processes of vocational choice differ markedly between youth from rich and poor backgrounds. Some young\npeople from low-wealth backgrounds do not have the privilege of attending college or exploring career options.\nMany work throughout high school and once they graduate, they need to get whatever full-time jobs they can to\nhelp support their families. For some youth who live in economically depressed areas (e.g., some rural regions or\nNative reservations), these dawning realizations may lead them to leave their families for cities or regions with\ngreater economic opportunities.\nCareer opportunities for people of color may be limited by societal expectations and discrimination in areas\nranging from guidance counseling and hiring to professional networking, mentorship and promotion, with\nthe result that Black and Hispanic people, along with other groups of people of color, are under-represented\nin higher-status and higher-paying jobs (Hotchkiss & Borow, 1990; Walsh et al, 2001; Worthington, Flores,\n& Navarro, 2005). The intersectionality between class and ethnicity is particularly pronounced in vocational\ndevelopment: On one hand, SES plays a large role, in that disparities in educational quality due to inadequate\nschool funding directly inhibit career choices. On the other hand, some of the most pronounced ethnic\ndifferences in employment and opportunities are actually found when comparing members of different ethnic\ngroups who are of a similar SES \u2013 those who are college-educated, or middle-class, for example (e.g., Wilson,\nTienda, and Wu, 1995).\nJust like identity development, vocational decision-making can be re-opened at later ages for any number of reasons:\ndissatisfaction with a current line of work, lay-offs or recessions, geographical relocation, emergence of new job sectors,\nor changes in other life domains (e.g., divorce or birth of a child). These changes can initiate additional rounds of\nvocational decision making, including reflection about one\u2019s interests, talents, and values, exploration of alternative\npossible career choices, and identification of new lines of work. When such decision-making takes place during middle\nage, job seekers may be especially attuned to the ways in which careers allow them to engage with the developmental\ntask of generativity. That is, middle-age people may focus especially on issues of value, meaning, and purpose, so they\ncan find career pathways that allow them to mentor and guide others, and make lasting contributions to society.\nVocational Development | 295 Factors that Influence Vocational Decision-making\nAlthough most youth proceed along the normative path of vocational development described above, other pathways are\npossible. Some young people identity their chosen profession at a very young age (often following in familial footsteps)\nand directly pursue that goal all throughout high school and college. Others make up and then change their minds\nmultiple times, even going so far as to start different careers before figuring out what is right for them, while others\nremain undecided for long periods of time, and may support themselves with a series of low level jobs while they make\nprogress on this task. Others may pick a calling for which society provides little remuneration (e.g., artist or social\nactivist) and then find ways to support themselves on the side. Young people who attend college are provided additional\ntime and scaffolding, since college is designed to help students learn about their own interests and values, and gain\nknowledge and credentials relevant to specific vocations. Youth from lower SES families may have fewer choices and\nfeel more pressure to begin work as soon as possible, making it more difficult for them to attend college or explore\nvocational options.\nAlthough vocational choice is considered to be the result of decision-making processes, it is important to emphasize\nthat discerning one\u2019s vocation is not a cold calculation, in which people rationally weigh their skills, interest, and values\nagainst multiple job options to come up with the \u201clogical choice.\u201d Instead vocational development is a process that\nis deeply entwined with identity development, and so includes dimensions focused on meaning, value, motivation,\nemotion, and social relationships. It is a task that is actively negotiated and can be fraught with confusion, anxiety, and\nfrustration. The extent to which this task will progress in a positive direction depends on a wide variety of individual,\nsocial, and societal factors.\nVocational Interests and Personalities\nPeople are drawn to particular vocations based on the fit between their own interests (or vocational personalities) and\nthe nature of specific work environments. One of the most influential theories of vocational personalities was developed\nby John Holland (Holland, 1985, 1997). It was introduced in 1959 (Holland, 1959) and is still in use in many areas today,\nsuch as career counseling (Nauta, 2010; Click here to view article). The theory\u2019s core idea is that people typically fall\ninto one of six \u201cvocational personality\u201d types, each of which is characterized by a profile of interests, preferred activities,\nbeliefs, abilities, values, and characteristics. These interest profiles can be used to identify the kinds of jobs that might\nbe a good match for people with different vocational personalities. It is important to note that many people have more\nthan one set of interests, and would do well in a variety of professions (Holland, 1997; Spokane & Cruza-Guet, 2005).\n1. Realistic. People who like solving real world problems; working with their hands; building, fixing, or making things;\nand operating equipment, tools or machines. May be a good fit for mechanical and manual occupations like\nengineering, electrician, horticulturist, or farmer.\n2. Investigative. People who like to discover and research ideas; observe, investigate and experiment; ask questions\nand solve problems. May be a good fit for science, research, journalism, medical and health occupations.\n3. Artistic. People who enjoy creating or designing things; using art, music, writing, or drama to express themselves;\nand communicate or perform. Often a good fit to choose occupations in the creative arts, writing, photography,\ndesign.\n4. Social. People who like people and are concerned for others\u2019 well-being and welfare; and like working with others\nto teach, train, inform, help, treat, heal, cure, and serve. May be most comfortable in helping or human service\nprofessions, like teaching, social work, or counseling.\n5. Enterprising. People who are adventurous; and like meeting, leading, and influencing others; like planning and\nstrategizing. Are drawn to business, management, supervisory positions, sales, or politics.\n6. Conventional. People who enjoy working indoors at tasks that involve organizing, following procedures, working\n296 | Vocational Development with data or numbers, planning work and events. May be good fit for fields like business, librarian, office worker, or\ncomputer operator.\nIf you would like to see where you fall on these personality types, you can take Holland\u2019s assessment on the Bureau of\nLabor\u2019s webpage: https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip\nOccupational decisions are based, not only on people\u2019s interests and values, but also on other factors in their lives, such\nas financial circumstances, familial influences, and current educational and job opportunities. For example, during the\nGreat Recession that started in 2008, many people who could not find work decided to attend to college and gained\nadditional skills and qualifications. During that same time period, presumably based on economic uncertainty, more\nundergraduates opted to major in occupational sectors showing job growth and higher salaries, like business, the natural\nsciences, computing, and engineering (U.S, Department of Education, 2012).\nFamilial Influences\nFamilies pave the way for their children\u2019s vocational choices, starting before they are born. One of the most important\npredictors of a young adult\u2019s eventual occupation is the SES of their family of origin. Children from high SES\nbackgrounds have more and better educational opportunities, in the form of higher quality schools with better academic\nprograms, more enrichment activities (e.g., extracurricular activities, clubs, and summer camps focused on topics like\nscience, engineering, computer programming, and robotics), greater access to better quality higher education, and\nbetter networks of social capital for seeking internships and jobs (Kalil, Levine, & Ziol-Guest, 2005).\nParents with more wealth and education (and especially mothers with more education) confer a host of advantages on\ntheir offspring and these eventually translate into better academic performance at all levels of school, which is one\nof the strongest predictors of occupational attainment. Families also influence vocational decision-making processes\nindirectly by the status and range of occupations they model, as well as directly by trying to persuade youth to consider\nor follow specific career pathways. High SES families also buffer their offspring when young people chose sporadic\nemployment or low paying professions (e.g., artist, musician) by financially subsidizing their career choices.\nParenting style. Research on parenting styles suggests that authoritative parenting provides the greatest support for\nconstructive vocational decision-making since it both encourages youth to discover their own interests and passions,\nwhile also helping them develop tools like self-discipline and achievement orientations that will enable them to make\nprogress along their chosen route. Authoritarian parenting, with its rigid demands for obedience and compliance,\nmay interfere with exploratory efforts and lead to premature foreclosure on parentally-specified options. These heavy-\nhanded tactics may sometimes lead to higher occupational attainment (as seen, for example, in some Asian-American\nor Jewish families) but they can also undermine some of the long-term development fostered by career choices that are\na better match for individuals\u2019 interests and proclivities. In other cases, family obligations may lead students to drop\nout in order to help with financial support (as seen in some Latinx youth, who as a group have the lowest educational\nattainment but the highest rates of employment of all racial/ethnic groups). Permissive parenting may interfere with\nyoung people\u2019s capacities to come to terms with the realities of the job market and delay decision making, whereas\nneglectful parenting robs youth of the support and scaffolding they need for constructive exploration and decision\nmaking, and so may contribute to unemployment or sporadic employment in low skilled jobs.\nUpward social mobility. In general, children and youth tend to prefer the kinds of occupations that they see in their\nparents and neighbors. As a result, youth from high SES families are more likely to prefer and pursue high-status\nwhite color professions, such as medicine, law, or academia, whereas those from low SES families are more likely to\nfavor and go into blue collar careers, some of which are high skill (like plumbing, electrician, preschool teacher) and\nsome of which are low skill (food service worker, cashier, delivery driver), but all of which have a lower pay scale. The\ncorrespondence in occupations between parents and children is only partly a function of familiarity, persuasion, and\nVocational Development | 297 similarity in personality and interests (Ellis & Bonin, 2003; Schoon & Parsons, 2002). It also reflects the extent to which\nhigh and low SES families can \u201claunch\u201d children into higher status careers.\nAll parents can foster high educational and occupational aspirations. Over and above the effects of SES, career\nattainment is predicted by parental guidance, high demands and expectations to succeed in school, and pressure toward\nhigh-status jobs (Bryant, Zvonkovic, & Reynolds, 2006; Stringer & Kerpelman, 2010). In a process called upward mobility,\na young person can break out of the SES level of their family of origin, as seen for example, in the great success of\nmany first generation college students. Based on multiple societal trends, however, upward social mobility has gotten\nincreasingly difficult over the last several decades.\nSocietal and Cultural Factors\nMany of the factors that are typically described as \u201cfamily influences\u201d on vocational decision making also reflect\npowerful societal and political forces that shape young people\u2019s educational and occupational opportunities. For\nexample, trends in politics and business have reduced well-paying employment opportunities in the blue collar sector\nover the last several decades. These trends include the loss of manufacturing jobs, increases in automation, the\ngrowth of the information economy, the stagnation of the minimum wage, weakening or breaking up unions, economic\nrecessions and patterns of unemployment or underemployment that disproportionately disadvantage low SES and\nminority workers.\nAlternative societal decisions would make it much easier for young people to find meaningful work and to be able to\nsupport themselves and their families on their wages. Successful strategies employed in other countries include policies\ndesigned to promote job growth, reduce income inequality, provide access to free high-quality higher education and job\n(re)training, maintaining the minimum wage at a level that keeps up with the cost of living, subsidizing child care, and\nmaking sure that healthcare is free or affordable and not tied to specific jobs. These decisions influence the vocational\noptions (and quality of life) open, not only to young people entering the job market, but to workers all across the lifespan.\nTeacher Support and Encouragement\nMany youth who go on to careers that require prolonged education or training report that their vocational decision\nmaking process was influenced by their teachers. During high school or college, their teachers took a special interest,\nand mentored or otherwise encouraged them to continue along certain occupational pathways (Bright et al., 2005;\nReddin, 1997). High school students that go on to college tend to have more positive connections with teachers\nthan non-college-bound students, and such close relationships promote higher career aspirations, especially in young\nwomen (Wigfield et al., 2002). Such connections are especially important to first generation students and students from\nunderrepresented minority backgrounds who may not have many role models in their immediate family.\nGender Stereotypes\nGender disparities in occupational status and income have steadily decreased over the last several decades, as more\nand more women enter the labor force. Gender-role attitudes are changing, and girls show greater interest in male-\ndominated professions, but progress has been slow. Although girls typically outperform boys academically all\nthroughout school, and graduate from college at higher rates (both overall and within every racial/ethnic group), they\nreach high school less confident in their academic competence, more likely to underestimate their achievement, and\nless interested in careers in mathematics, natural science, and engineering (Ceci & Williams, 2010; Parker et al., 2012).\nDuring college, many women\u2019s career aspirations further decline as they worry about their capacity to succeed in\nchallenging classes and careers in science and mathematics, and wonder whether they will be able to combine a high-\npowered career with responsibilities of children and families (Chhin, Bleeker, & Jacobs, 2008; Wigfield et al., 2006)\nWomen are still concentrated in a subset of college majors and in lower-status and less-well-paid occupations (US\nCensus Bureau, 2019). Untangling this problem requires a two-fold solution. First, high school and college teachers must\n298 | Vocational Development be sensitized to the roadblocks, discrimination, and prejudice girls and women face based on entrenched myths about\ntheir natural aptitude for male dominated subjects and professions. To reverse internalized biases, girls and women\nwould also benefit from some support in reworking these narratives to counteract their own concerns and insecurities.\nMany programs are now in place to increase the participation and success of women and ethnic minority students in\nSTEM fields. These programs typically include active recruitment, mentoring, creation of supportive peer cohorts, and\nguided research experiences, and have been somewhat successful at increasing graduation rates for some subgroups of\nstudents.\nA second correction to gender disparities in income involves improving the status and salary levels for traditionally\nfemale occupations, like childcare, eldercare, teaching, social work, and nursing. These occupations are of great benefit\nto society, yet workers are not paid in ways commensurate with this value. Society needs to reexamine its priorities,\nwhen someone who trades in financial markets where nothing of value is produced are paid hundreds of times more\nthan people whose dedication keeps premature infants alive or supports the frail elderly during their twilight years.\nFigure 8.3. Median\nweekly earnings of\nfull-time wage and\nsalary workers, by\ngender, race, and\nethnicity, 2009. (Based\non data from U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics.)\nCompared to women, men have changed little in their occupational choices; few pursue nontraditional careers, such as\nnursing or teaching elementary school. Those who do are less gender-typed, more liberal in their social attitudes, less\nconcerned with social status, and more interested in working with and helping people (Dodson & Borders, 2006; Jome,\nSurething, &Taylor, 2005). Men in non-traditional careers generally report high satisfaction in their work, but also note\nthat they have to deal with biases and stigma about their decisions to pursue lower-status occupations, especially from\nother men.\nNon-College-Bound Youth\nAccording to the US Census, the highest level of education completed by 28.1% of the labor force (i.e., population age\n25 and older) is high school, whereas 22.5% finished four years of college. Rates vary significantly by race/ethnicity:\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the share of the labor force with at least a high school diploma was\nmore than 90% each for Whites, Blacks, and Asians; but 76% for Hispanics. And 63% of Asians in the labor force had a\nbachelor\u2019s degree and higher, compared with 41% of Whites, 31% of Blacks, and 21% of Hispanics.\nAs a result, approximately one-third of young people who graduate high school do not go to college. This decision has\na big impact on their career options. Most of them find it difficult to secure a job other than the ones they held during\nVocational Development | 299 high school. Although high school graduates are more likely to find employment than young people who dropped out\nof high school, they have fewer occupational opportunities than their counterparts from earlier cohorts. During times\nof recession, those prospects worsen as positions that become available are taken by (sometimes overqualified) college\ngraduates. Before the recession created by the pandemic in 2020, unemployment rates for 24-35 year-olds who dropped\nout of high school were about 43%; for those who graduated high school about 26%, and for those who graduated\ncollege about 13% (National Center for Education Statistics).\nThe discouraging prospects of non-college bound youth are also a product of societal decisions about the educational\nand occupational tracks available in US schools. In contrast, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, and several\nEastern European countries have intentionally created national apprenticeship programs that facilitate the transition\nfrom high school to work. For example, about two-thirds of German students do not attend college preparatory high\nschools. Instead, starting in middle school, they head down a vocational track toward one of the most successful work-\nstudy apprenticeship programs for entering business and industry in the world. At age 15 or 16, during the last two years\nof compulsory education, they begin a program that combines part-time vocational courses with an apprenticeship\nthat is jointly sponsored by educators and employers (Deissinger, 2007). Students who finish the program and pass a\nqualifying exam are certified as skilled workers and enter occupations whose wages are set and protected by unions.\nIndustries provide funding for these apprenticeship programs because it is clear that they provide a dependable supply\nof motivated and skilled workers (Kerckhoff, 2002). In addition, such programs encourage students to stay in school and\nallow young people to begin productive work lives directly after high school. Providing a pipeline between the worlds\nof school and work not only benefits youth themselves, but also provides value to the rest of society by contributing to\nnational economic growth. To date, only small-scale work-study programs are attempting to bridge this gap in the US,\nbut larger scale national programs are needed.\nVocational development is an important task for young adults, but the process of defining occupational goals and\nlaunching a career are challenging. Young people know that their occupational choices can have lifelong consequences.\nJobs are sources of income and so influence living conditions and recreational options; they are how people spend much\nof their time and so fill their waking hours; workplaces can become extended \u201cneighborhoods\u201d or \u201cfamilies;\u201d and they can\nprovide a source of meaning and identity. No wonder young people may feel that the stakes are high. To constructively\nnegotiate this task, they need the support of family, schools, workplaces, and the larger society.\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 This Ted Talk inspires young folks to get involved with acitvist work, through the story of one young woman\u2019s work\nagainst child soldiers.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Intimate relationships are more difficult if one is still struggling with identity. Achieving a sense of\nidentity is a life-long process, as there are periods of identity crisis and stability. Once a sense of identity is established,\nyoung adults\u2019 focus often turns to intimate relationships. The word \u201cintimacy\u201d is often used to describe romantic or\nsexual relationships, but it also refers to the closeness, caring, and personal disclosure that can be found in many other\ntypes of relationships as well\u2013 and, of course, it is possible to have sexual relationships that do not include psychological\nintimacy or closeness. The need for intimacy can be met in many ways, including with friendships, familial relationships,\nand romantic relationships.\nFriendships\nFriendships provide one common way to achieve a sense of intimacy. In early adulthood, healthy friendships continue\nto be important for development, providing not only a source of support in tough times, but also improved self-esteem\nand general well-being (Berk, 2014; Collins & Madsen, 2006; Deci et al, 2006). As is the case in adolescence, friendships\nrich in intimacy, mutuality, and closeness are especially important for development (Blieszner & Roberto, 2012). Studies\nsuggest that women\u2019s friendships are characterized by somewhat more emotional intimacy in general, whereas men\u2019s\nfriendships tend to grow more emotionally close and include more personal disclosures the longer the friendships last\n(Berk, 2014; Sherman, de Vries, & Lansford, 2000). Friendships can tend to take a backseat when adults enter marriages\nand long-term partnerships, with more self-disclosures between romantic partners rather than between friends outside\nthe partnership. At the same time, maintaining healthy friendships after marriage and the birth of children remains\nimportant for well-being (Berk, 2014; Birditt & Antonucci, 2007).\nWorkplace friendships. Friendships often take root in the workplace, since people spend as much, or more, time at\nwork as they do with their family and friends (Kaufman & Hotchkiss, 2003). Often, it is through these relationships\nthat people receive mentoring and obtain social support and resources, but they can also experience conflicts and the\npotential for misinterpretation when sexual attraction is an issue. Indeed, Elsesser and Peplau (2006) found that many\nworkers reported that friendships grew out of collaborative work projects, and these friendships made their days more\npleasant. In addition to those benefits, Riordan and Griffeth (1995) found that people who work in an environment where\nfriendships can develop and be maintained are more likely to report higher levels of job satisfaction, job involvement,\nand organizational commitment, and they are more likely to remain in that job. Similarly, a Gallup poll revealed that\nemployees who had \u201cclose friends\u201d at work were almost 50% more satisfied with their jobs than those who did not\n(Armour, 2007).\nInternet friendships. What influence does the Internet have on friendships? It is not surprising that people use the\nInternet with the goal of meeting and making new friends (Fehr, 2008; McKenna, 2008). Researchers have wondered\nwhether virtual relationships (compared to ones conducted face-to-face) reduce the authenticity of relationships,\nor whether the Internet actually allows people to develop deep, meaningful connections. Interestingly, research has\ndemonstrated that virtual relationships are often as intimate as in-person relationships; in fact, Bargh and colleagues\nfound that online relationships are sometimes more intimate (Bargh et al., 2002). This can be especially true for those\nindividuals who are socially anxious and lonely\u2014such individuals are more likely to turn to the Internet to find new\nLove and Relationships | 305 and meaningful relationships (McKenna, Green, & Gleason, 2002). McKenna et al. (2002) suggest that for people who\nhave a hard time meeting and maintaining relationships, due to shyness, anxiety, or lack of face-to-face social skills, the\nInternet provides a safe, nonthreatening place to develop and maintain relationships. Similarly, Benford (2008) found\nthat for high-functioning autistic individuals, the Internet facilitates communication and relationship development with\nothers, which would be more difficult in face-to-face contexts, leading to the conclusion that Internet communication\ncan be empowering for those who feel dissatisfied when communicating face to face.\nRelationships with Parents and Siblings\nIn early adulthood the parent-child relationship transitions by necessity toward a relationship between two adults.\nThis involves a reappraisal of the relationship by both parents and young adults. One of the biggest challenges for\nparents, especially during emerging adulthood, is coming to terms with the adult status of their children. Aquilino\n(2006) suggests that parents who are reluctant or unable to do so may hinder young adults\u2019 identity development. This\nproblem becomes more pronounced when young adults still reside with their parents and are financially dependent on\nthem. Arnett (2004) reported that leaving home often helped promote psychological growth and independence in early\nadulthood.\nSibling relationships are one of the longest-lasting bonds in people\u2019s lives. Yet, there is little research on the nature\nof sibling relationships in adulthood (Aquilino, 2006). What is known is that the nature of these relationships change,\nas adults have a choice as to whether they will create or maintain a close bond and continue to be a part of the\nlife of a sibling. Siblings must make the same reappraisal of each other as adults, as parents have to with their adult\nchildren. Research has shown a decline in the frequency of interactions between siblings during early adulthood, as\npresumably peers, romantic relationships, and children become more central to the lives of young adults. Aquilino (2006)\nsuggests that the task in early adulthood may be to maintain enough of a bond so that there will be a foundation for\nthis relationship in later life. Those who are successful can often move away from the \u201colder-younger\u201d sibling conflicts\nof childhood, toward a more egalitarian relationship between two adults. Siblings that were close to each other in\nchildhood are typically close in adulthood (Dunn, 1984, 2007), and in fact, it is unusual for siblings to develop closeness\nfor the first time in adulthood. Overall, the majority of adult sibling relationships are close (Cicirelli, 2009).\nBeginning Close Romantic Relationships: Factors influencing Attraction\nBecause most of us enter into a close romantic relationship at some point, it is useful to know what psychologists\nhave learned about the principles of liking and loving. A major interest of psychologists is the study of interpersonal\nattraction, or what makes people like, and even love, each other.\nProximity. One important factor in initiating relationships is proximity, or the extent to which people are physically near\nus. Research has found that we are more likely to develop friendships with people who are nearby, for instance, those\nwho live in the same dorm that we do, and even with people who just happen to sit nearer to us in our classes (Back,\nSchmukle, & Egloff, 2008).\nProximity has its effect on liking through the principle of mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer stimuli\n(including, but not limited to people) that we have seen more frequently. The effect of mere exposure is powerful and\noccurs in a wide variety of situations. Infants tend to smile at a photograph of someone they have seen before more than\nthey smile at a photograph of someone they are seeing for the first time (Brooks-Gunn & Lewis, 1981), and people prefer\nside-to-side reversed images of their own faces over their normal (nonreversed) face, whereas their friends prefer their\n306 | Love and Relationships normal face over the reversed one (Mita, Dermer, & Knight, 1977). This is expected on the basis of mere exposure, since\npeople see their own faces primarily in mirrors, and thus are exposed to the reversed face more often.\nMere exposure may well have an evolutionary basis. We have an initial fear of the unknown, but as things become\nfamiliar, they seem more similar and safer, and thus produce more positive affect and seem less threatening and\ndangerous (Harmon-Jones & Allen, 2001; Freitas, Azizian, Travers, & Berry, 2005). When the stimuli are people, there may\nwell be an added effect. Familiar people become more likely to be seen as part of the ingroup rather than the outgroup,\nand this may lead us to like them more. Zebrowitz and her colleagues found that we like people of our own race in part\nbecause they are perceived as similar to us (Zebrowitz, Bornstad, & Lee, 2007).\nSimilarity. An important determinant of attraction is a perceived similarity in values and beliefs between the partners\n(Davis & Rusbult, 2001). Similarity is important for relationships because it is more convenient if both partners like\nthe same activities and because similarity supports one\u2019s values. We can feel better about ourselves and our choice of\nactivities if we see that our partner also enjoys doing the same things that we do. Having others like and believe in the\nsame things we do makes us feel validated in our beliefs. This is referred to as consensual validation and is an important\naspect of why we are attracted to others.\nSelf-Disclosure. Liking is also enhanced by self-disclosure, the tendency to communicate frequently, without fear of\nreprisal, and in an accepting and empathetic manner. Friends are friends because we can talk to them openly about our\nneeds and goals and because they listen and respond to our needs (Reis & Aron, 2008). However, self-disclosure must be\nbalanced. If we open up about our concerns that are important to us, we expect our partner to do the same in return. If\nthe self-disclosure is not reciprocal, the relationship may not last.\nLove\nPhilosophers and poets have wondered about the nature of love for centuries, and psychologists have also theorized\nabout definitions, components, and kinds of love. Sternberg (1988) suggests that there are three main components of\nlove: Passion, intimacy, and commitment (see figure, below). Love relationships vary depending on the presence or\nabsence of each of these components. Passion refers to the intense, physical attraction partners feel toward one another.\nIntimacy involves the ability the share feelings, psychological closeness and personal thoughts with the other. Commitment\nis the conscious decision to stay together. Passion can be found in the early stages of a relationship, but intimacy takes\ntime to develop because it is based on knowledge of and sharing with the partner. Once intimacy has been established,\npartners may resolve to stay in the relationship. Although many would agree that all three components are important to\na relationship, many love relationships do not consist of all three. Let\u2019s look at other possibilities.\nLove and Relationships | 307 Figure 8.4. Sternberg\u2019s Triarchic Theory of Love\nLiking. In this kind of relationship, intimacy or knowledge of the other and a sense of closeness is present. Passion and\ncommitment, however, are not. Partners feel free to be themselves and disclose personal information. They may feel that\nthe other person knows them well and can be honest with them and let them know if they think the person is wrong.\nThese partners are friends. However, being told that your partner \u201cthinks of you as a friend\u201d can be a painful blow if you\nare attracted to them and seeking a romantic involvement.\nInfatuation. Perhaps, this is Sternberg\u2019s version of \u201clove at first sight\u201d or what adolescents would call a \u201ccrush.\u201d\nInfatuation consists of an immediate, intense physical attraction to someone. A person who is infatuated finds it hard to\nthink of anything but the other person. Brief encounters are played over and over in one\u2019s head; it may be difficult to eat\nand there may be a rather constant state of arousal. Infatuation is typically short-lived, however, lasting perhaps only a\nmatter of months or as long as a year or so. It tends to be based on physical attraction and an image of what one \u201cthinks\u201d\nthe other is all about.\nFatuous Love. However, some people who have a strong physical attraction push for commitment early in the\nrelationship. Passion and commitment are aspects of fatuous love. There is no intimacy and the commitment is\npremature. Partners rarely talk seriously or share their ideas. They focus on their intense physical attraction and yet\none, or both, is also talking of making a lasting commitment. Sometimes insistence on premature commitment follows\nfrom a sense of insecurity and a desire to make sure the partner is locked into the relationship.\nEmpty Love. This type of love may be found later in a relationship or in a relationship that was formed to meet needs\nother than intimacy or passion, including financial needs, childrearing assistance, or attaining/maintaining status. Here\nthe partners are committed to staying in the relationship for the children, because of a religious conviction, or because\nthere are no alternatives. However, they do not share ideas or feelings with each other and have no (or no longer any)\nphysical attraction for one another.\nRomantic Love. Intimacy and passion are components of romantic love, but there is no commitment. The partners\nspend much time with one another and enjoy their closeness, but have not made plans to continue. This may be true\n308 | Love and Relationships because they are not in a position to make such commitments or because they are looking for passion and closeness\nand are afraid it will die out if they commit to one another and start to focus on other kinds of obligations.\nCompanionate Love. Intimacy and commitment are the hallmarks of companionate love. Partners love and respect one-\nanother and they are committed to staying together. However, their physical attraction may have never been strong or\nmay have just died out over time. Nevertheless, partners are good friends and committed to one another.\nConsummate Love. Intimacy, passion, and commitment are present in consummate love. This is often perceived by\nwestern cultures as \u201cthe ideal\u201d type of love. The couple shares passion; the spark has not died, and the closeness is there.\nThey feel like best friends, as well as lovers, and they are committed to staying together.\nAttachment in Young Adulthood\nHazan and Shaver (1987) described the attachment styles of adults, using the same three general categories proposed\nby Ainsworth\u2019s research on young children: secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent. Hazan and Shaver developed\nthree brief paragraphs describing the three adult attachment styles. Adults were then asked to think about romantic\nrelationships they were in and select the paragraph that best described the way they felt, thought, and behaved in these\nrelationships (See table, below).\nTable 8.2 Attachment in Young Adulthood\nWhich of the following\nbest describes you in your\nromantic relationships?\nAttachment Style Response\nI find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having\nSecure them depend on me. I don\u2019t often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close\nto me.\nI am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely,\nAvoidant difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often,\nlove partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.\nI find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn\u2019t\nAnxious/Resistant really love me or won\u2019t stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this\nsometimes scares people away.\nAdapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019 and Hazan & Shaver, 1987\nBartholomew (1990) challenged the categorical view of attachment in adults and suggested that adult attachment\nwas best described as varying along two dimensions; attachment related-anxiety and attachment-related avoidance.\nAttachment-related anxiety refers to the extent to which an adult worries about whether their partner really loves them.\nThose who score high on this dimension fear that their partner will reject or abandon them (Fraley, Hudson, Heffernan,\n& Segal, 2015). Attachment-related avoidance refers to whether an adult can open up to others, and whether they trust and\nfeel they can depend on others. Those who score high on attachment-related avoidance are uncomfortable with opening\nup and may fear that such dependency may limit their sense of autonomy (Fraley et al., 2015). According to Bartholomew\n(1990) this would yield four possible attachment styles in adults; secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful-avoidant\n(see Figure, below.)\nLove and Relationships | 309 Figure 8.5. Four-Category Model with the Two-Dimensions of Attachment (Adapted from Fraley, et al., 2015. p.\n355)\nSecurely attached adults score lower on both dimensions. They are comfortable trusting their partners and do not\nworry excessively about their partner\u2019s love for them. Adults with a dismissing style score low on attachment-related\nanxiety, but higher on attachment-related avoidance. Such adults dismiss the importance of relationships. They trust\nthemselves, but do not trust others, thus do not share their dreams, goals, and fears with others. They do not depend\non other people and feel uncomfortable when they have to do so.\nThose with a preoccupied attachment are low in attachment-related avoidance, but high in attachment-related anxiety.\nSuch adults are often prone to jealousy and worry that their partner does not love them as much as they need to\nbe loved. Adults whose attachment style is fearful-avoidant score high on both attachment-related avoidance and\nattachment-related anxiety. These adults want close relationships, but do not feel comfortable getting emotionally close\nto others. They have trust issues with others and often do not trust their own social skills in maintaining relationships.\nResearch on attachment in adulthood has found that:\n\u2022 \u2022Adults with insecure attachments report lower satisfaction in their relationships (Butzer, & Campbell, 2008;\nHolland, Fraley, & Roisman, 2012).\n\u2022 Those high in attachment-related anxiety report more daily conflict in their relationships (Campbell, Simpson,\nBoldry, & Kashy, 2005).\n\u2022 Those with avoidant attachment exhibit less support to their partners (Simpson, Rholes, Ori\u00f1a, & Grich, 2002).\n\u2022 \u2022 Young adults show greater attachment-related anxiety than do middle-aged or older adults (Chopik, Edelstein, &\nFraley, 2013).\n\u2022 Some studies report that young adults show more attachment-related avoidance (Schindler, Fagundes, & Murdock,\n2010), while other studies find that middle-aged adults show higher avoidance than younger or older adults\n(Chopik et al., 2013).\n310 | Love and Relationships \u2022 Young adults with more secure and positive relationships with their parents make the transition to adulthood\nmore easily than do those with more insecure attachments (Fraley, 2013).\n\u2022 Young adults with secure attachments and authoritative parents were less likely to be depressed than those with\nauthoritarian or permissive parents or who experienced an avoidant or ambivalent attachment (Ebrahimi, Amiri,\nMohamadlou, & Rezapur, 2017).\nDo people with certain attachment styles attract those with similar styles? When people are asked what kinds of\npsychological or behavioral qualities they are seeking in a romantic partner, a large majority of people indicate that they\nare seeking someone who is kind, caring, trustworthy, and understanding, that is, who has the kinds of attributes that\ncharacterize a \u201csecure\u201d caregiver (Chappell & Davis, 1998). However, we know that people do not always end up with\nothers who meet their ideals. Are secure people more likely to end up with secure partners, and, vice versa, are insecure\npeople more likely to end up with insecure partners? The majority of the research that has been conducted to date\nsuggests that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d Frazier, Byer, Fischer, Wright, and DeBord (1996) studied the attachment patterns of\nmore than 83 heterosexual couples and found that, if the man was relatively secure, the woman was also likely to be\nsecure.\nOne important question is whether these findings exist because (a) secure people are more likely to be attracted to\nother secure people, (b) secure people are likely to create security in their partners over time, or (c) some combination\nof these possibilities. Existing empirical research strongly supports the first alternative. For example, when people have\nthe opportunity to interact with individuals who vary in security in a speed-dating context, they express a greater\ninterest in those who are higher in security than those who are more insecure (McClure, Lydon, Baccus, & Baldwin,\n2010). It also is likely that secure people, who have the characteristics that many consider make an ideal partner, have\ntheir choice of partners so they select ones who are also closer to the ideal, namely, secure people. However, there is\nalso some evidence that people\u2019s attachment styles mutually shape one another in close relationships. For example, in a\nlongitudinal study, Hudson, Fraley, Vicary, and Brumbaugh (2012) found that, if one person in a relationship experienced\na change in security, his or her partner was likely to experience a change in the same direction.\nDo early experiences as children shape adult attachment? The majority of research on this issue is retrospective;\nthat is, it relies on adults\u2019 reports of what they recall about their childhood experiences. This kind of work suggests\nthat secure adults are more likely to describe their early childhood experiences with their parents as being supportive,\nloving, and kind (Hazan & Shaver, 1987). A number of longitudinal studies are emerging that demonstrate prospective\nassociations between early attachment experiences and adult attachment styles and/or interpersonal functioning in\nadulthood. For example, Fraley, Roisman, Booth- LaForce, Owen, and Holland (2013) found in a sample of more than\n700 individuals studied from infancy to adulthood that maternal sensitivity across development prospectively predicted\nsecurity at age 18. Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon (2007) found that attachment security, assessed in infancy in the\nstrange situation, predicted peer competence in grades one to three, which, in turn, predicted the quality of friendship\nrelationships at age 16, which, in turn, predicted the expression of positive and negative emotions in their adult romantic\nrelationships at ages 20 to 23. You can see how positive relationships with both parents and peers contribute to higher\nquality relationships with romantic partners.\nIt is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken assumption that early experiences \u201cdetermine\u201d later\noutcomes. To be clear, attachment theorists assume that the connection between early experiences and subsequent\noutcomes is probabilistic, not deterministic. Having supportive and responsive experiences with caregivers early in life\nis assumed to set the stage for positive social development, but that does not mean that attachment patterns are set\nin stone. In short, even if an individual has far from optimal experiences in early life, attachment theory suggests that\nit is possible for that individual to develop well-functioning adult relationships. People are able to rework the effects\nof their early experiences through a number of corrective pathways, including relationships with siblings, other family\nmembers, teachers, and close friends. Security is best viewed as an accumulation of a person\u2019s attachment history rather\nLove and Relationships | 311 than a reflection of his or her early experiences alone. Those early experiences are considered important, not because\nthey determine a person\u2019s fate, but because they provide the foundation for subsequent experiences.\nRelationships 101: Predictors of Marital Harmony\nAdvice on how to improve one\u2019s marriage is centuries old. One of today\u2019s experts on marital communication is John\nGottman. Gottman (1999) differs from many marriage counselors in his belief that having a good marriage does not\ndepend on compatibility. Rather, he argues that the way partners communicate with one another is crucial. At the\nUniversity of Washington in Seattle, Gottman has conducted some of the most thorough and interesting studies of\nmarital relationships. His research team measured the physiological responses of thousands of couples as they discuss\nissues of disagreement. Fidgeting in one\u2019s chair, leaning closer to or further away from the partner while speaking, and\nincreases in respiration and heart rate are all recorded and analyzed along with videotaped recordings of the partners\u2019\nexchanges. Gottman is trying to identify aspects of communication patterns that can accurately predict whether or not\na couple will stay together. In marriages destined to fail, partners engage in the \u201cmarriage killers\u201d: Contempt, criticism,\ndefensiveness, and stonewalling. Each of these undermines the caring and respect that healthy marriages require. To\nsome extent, all partnerships include some of these behaviors occasionally, but when these behaviors become the norm,\nthey can signal that the end of the relationships is near; for that reason, they are known as \u201cGottman\u2019s Four Horsemen of\nthe Apocalypse\u201d. Contempt, which it entails mocking or derision and communicates the other partner is inferior, is seen\nof the worst of the four because it is the strongest predictor of divorce. (Click here for a suggestions on diffusing your\nown contempt.)\nGottman, Carrere, Buehlman, Coan, and Ruckstuhl (2000) researched the perceptions newlyweds had about their\npartner and marriage. The Oral History Interview used in this study, which looks at eight variables in marriage including:\nFondness/affection, we-ness, expansiveness/ expressiveness, negativity, disappointment, and three aspects of conflict\nresolution (chaos, volatility, glorifying the struggle), was able to predict the stability of the marriage (vs. divorce) with\n87% accuracy at the four to six year-point and 81% accuracy at the seven to nine year-point. Gottman (1999) developed\nworkshops for couples to strengthen their marriages based on the results of the Oral History Interview. Interventions\ninclude increasing positive regard for each other, strengthening their friendship, and improving communication and\nconflict resolution patterns.\nAccumulated Positive Deposits to the \u201cEmotional Bank Account.\u201d When there is a positive balance of relationship\ndeposits this can help the overall relationship in times of conflict. For instance, some research indicates that a husband\u2019s\nlevel of enthusiasm in everyday marital interactions was related to a wife\u2019s affection in the midst of conflict (Driver\n& Gottman, 2004), showing that being friendly and making deposits can change the nature of conflict. Gottman and\nLevenson (1992) also found that couples rated as having more pleasant interactions, compared with couples with less\npleasant interactions, reported higher marital satisfaction, less severe marital problems, better physical health, and less\nrisk for divorce. Finally, Janicki, Kamarck, Shiffman, and Gwaltney (2006) showed that the intensity of conflict with\na spouse predicted marital satisfaction, unless there was a record of positive partner interactions, in which case the\nconflict did not matter as much. Again, it seems as though having a positive balance through prior positive deposits\nhelps to keep relationships strong even in the midst of conflict.\nMany additional techniques for maintaining healthy relationships, such as building love maps, turning\ntowards our partner\u2019s \u201cbids\u201d for affection and attention, managing conflict, and changing how we interpret\nconflict, can be found on the Gottman Institute Website.\n312 | Love and Relationships References\nAquilino, W.

If we do,\n\u201cfamily\u201d encompasses most of our activities in adult life other than work, friendships, and me-time. For many people,\nclose friends are considered part of family.\nWe know that some families involve intimate relationships and children, but there are also other important facets. Family\nlife revolves around the home. An important aspect of life for every adult is where they live and who lives with them.\nAnother aspect is \u201chome-making\u201d\u2013cooking, cleaning, and maintenance. Who does what? Family life also involves doing\nthings together and enjoying a sense of community. For most adults in most cultures, the primary organizing factor\nin their lives is family, hence, the phrase \u201cfamily life.\u201d Much of development during adulthood revolves around where a\nperson finds themselves in the family life cycle, in terms of moving through a sequence of finding a partner, forming a\nhousehold family unit, and having or not having and raising children.\nFamily life cycle patterns differ across cultures and subcultures, and shift with historical time. The overarching objective\nor task of the family life cycle is to create the life that fits and works for the individual, that is consistent with their\npersonal characteristics and preferences, the life they want. Successful navigation of the family life cycle means\nfinding a life that is personally meaningful and fulfilling for you and that works for the rest of your family (however\nconstituted) as well.\nFamily Life Cycle | 317 Single Adulthood\nSinglehood. Being single is the most common lifestyle for people in their early 20s, and there has been an increase in the\nnumber of adults choosing to remain single. In 1960, only about 1 in 10 adults age 25 or older had never been married,\nin 2012 that had risen to 1 in 5 (Wang & Parker, 2014). While just over half (53%) of unmarried adults say they would\neventually like to get married, 32 percent are not sure, and 13 percent do not want to get married.\nIt is projected that by the time people who are currently young adults reach their mid-40s and 50s, almost 25% of them\nmay never have married. The U.S. is not the only country to see a rise in the number of single adults. The table below\nlists some of the reasons young adults give for staying single. In addition, adults are marrying later in life, cohabitating,\nand raising children outside of marriage in greater numbers than in previous generations. Young adults also have other\npriorities, such as education, and establishing their careers.\nTable 8.3 Reasons for Staying Single\nHave not met the right person 30%\nDo not have financial stability 27%\nNot ready to settle down 22%\nToo young to marry 22%\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nHistorical trends in lifestyles and priorities may be reflected in changes in attitudes about the importance of marriage.\nIn a recent Pew Research survey of Americans, respondents were asked to indicate which of the following statements\ncame closer to their own views:\n\u2022 \u201cSociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSociety is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children.\u201d\nSlightly more adults endorsed the second statement (50%) than those who chose the first (46%), with the remainder\neither selecting neither, both equally, or not responding (Wang & Parker, 2014). Young adults age 18-29 were more likely\nto endorse this second view than adults age 30 to 49; 67% and 53% respectively. In contrast, those age 50 or older were\nmore likely to endorse the first statement (53%).\nCommitted Relationships and Marriage\nCohabitation. In American society, as well as in a number of other cultures, cohabitation has become increasingly\ncommonplace (Gurrentz, 2018). For many emerging adults, age 18-24, cohabitation has become more common than\nmarriage, as can be seen in Figure 8.6 below. While marriage is still a more common living arrangement for those\n25-34, cohabitation has increased, while marriage has declined, as can be seen in Figure 8.7. Gurrentz also found that\ncohabitation varies by socioeconomic status. Those who are married tend to have higher levels of education, and thus\nhigher earnings, or earning potential.\n318 | Family Life Cycle Figure 8.6.\nFigure 8.7.\nCopen, Daniels, and Mosher (2013) found that from 1995 to 2010 the median length of the cohabitation relationship had\nFamily Life Cycle | 319 increased regardless of whether the relationship resulted in marriage, remained intact, or had since dissolved. In 1995\nthe median length of the cohabitation relationship was 13 months, whereas by 2010 it was 22 months. Cohabitation for\nall racial/ethnic groups, except for Asian women increased between 1995 and 2010 (see Table 8.4). Forty percent of\nthe cohabitations transitioned into marriage within three years, 32% were still cohabitating, and 27% of cohabitating\nrelationships had dissolved within the three years.\nTable 8.4 Percentage of women by race/ethnicity whose first union was cohabitation\n1995 2006-2010\nHispanic 30% 47%\nWhite 35% 49%\nBlack 35% 49%\nAsian 22% 22%\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019\nBased on data from Copen et al., 2013\nThree explanations have been given for the rise of cohabitation in Western cultures. The first notes that the increase\nin individualism and secularism, and the resulting decline in religious observance, has led to greater acceptance and\nadoption of cohabitation (Lesthaeghe & Surkyn, 1988). Moreover, the more people observe couples cohabitating, the\nmore normal this relationship seems, and the more couples will then cohabitate. Thus, cohabitation is both a cause and\nthe effect of greater cohabitation.\nA second explanation focuses on the economic changes. The growth of industry and the modernization of many cultures\nhas improved women\u2019s social status, leading to greater gender equality and sexual freedom, with marriage no longer\nbeing the only long-term relationship option (Bumpass, 1990). A final explanation suggests that changes in employment\nrequirements, with many jobs now requiring more advanced education, has led to a delay in marriage while youth pursue\npost-secondary education (Yu & Xie, 2015). Since most people marry soon after they have competed their highest level of\neducation (e.g., people who complete only high school generally marry at 18-19 years old whereas people who graduate\ncollege typically marry at age 24-25), this might account for the increase in the age of first marriage in many nations.\nTaken together, the greater acceptance of premarital sex, and the economic and educational changes would lead to a\ntransition in relationships. Overall, cohabitation may become a step in the courtship process or may, for some, replace\nmarriage altogether. Similar increases in cohabitation have also occurred in other industrialized countries. For example,\nrates are high in Great Britain, Australia, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. In fact, more children in Sweden are born to\ncohabiting couples than to married couples. The lowest rates of cohabitation in industrialized countries are in Ireland,\nItaly, and Japan (Benokraitis, 2005).\nCohabitation in Non-Western Cultures, the Philippines and China. Similar to other nations, young people in the\nPhilippines are more likely to delay marriage, to cohabitate, and to engage in premarital sex as compared to previous\ngenerations (Williams, Kabamalan, & Ogena, 2007). Despite these changes, however, many young people are still not in\nfavor of these practices. Moreover, there is still a persistence of traditional gender norms as there are stark differences\nin the acceptance of sexual behavior out of wedlock for men and women in Philippine society. Young men are given\ngreater freedom. In China, young adults are cohabitating in higher numbers than in the past (Yu & Xie, 2015). Unlike\nmany Western cultures, in China adults with higher, rather than lower, levels of education are more likely to cohabitate.\nYu and Xie suggest this may be because cohabitation is seen as more \u201cinnovative\u201d or \u201cmodern,\u201d and that those who are\nmore highly educated may have had more exposure to Western cultures.\n320 | Family Life Cycle Marriage Worldwide. Cohen (2013) reviewed data assessing most of the world\u2019s countries and found that rates of\nmarriage have declined universally during the last several decades. Although this decline has occurred in both poor and\nrich countries, the countries with the biggest drops in marriage were mostly rich: France, Italy, Germany, Japan and the\nU.S. Cohen argues that these declines are due not only to individuals delaying marriage, but also to higher rates of non-\nmarital cohabitation. Delays or decreases in marriage are associated with higher income and lower fertility rates that\nare observed worldwide.\nMarriage in the United States. In 1960, 72% of adults age 18 or older were married, in 2010 this number had dropped\nto barely half (Wang & Taylor, 2011). At the same time, the age of first marriage has been increasing for both men and\nwomen. In 1960, the average age for first marriage was 20 for women and 23 for men. By 2010 this had increased to 26.5\nfor women and nearly 29 for men (see Figure 8.8). Many of the explanations for increases in singlehood and cohabitation\nprovided previously (especially increasing number of years of education) can also account for the drop and delay in\nmarriage.\nFigure 8.8. Marriage in the U.S.\nSame-Sex Marriage. In June 26, 2015, the United States\nSupreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees same-\nsex marriage. The decision indicated that limiting marriage to\nonly heterosexual couples violated the 14th amendment\u2019s\nguarantee of equal protection under the law. This ruling\noccurred 11 years after same-sex marriage was first made legal\nin Massachusetts, and at the time of the high court decision, 36\nstates and the District of Columbia had legalized same sex\nmarriage. Worldwide, 29 countries currently have national laws\nallowing gays and lesbians to marry (Pew Research Center,\n2019).\nFigure 8.9\nCultural Influences on Marriage. Many cultures have both\nexplicit and unstated rules that specify who is an appropriate mate. Consequently, mate selection is not completely left\nFamily Life Cycle | 321 to the individual. Rules of endogamy indicate the groups we should marry within and those we should not (Witt, 2009).\nFor example, many cultures specify that people marry within their own race, social class, age group, or religion. For\nexample, for most of its history, the US upheld laws that criminalized marriage between people from different races;\nthe last such laws were struck down by a Supreme Court ruling in 1967. Endogamy reinforces the cohesiveness of the\ngroup. Additionally, these rules encourage homogamy or marriage between people who share social characteristics. The\nmajority of marriages in the U. S. are homogamous with respect to race, social class, age and to a lesser extent, religion.\nHomogamy is also seen in couples with similar personalities and interests.\nArranged Marriages and Elopement. Historically, marriage was not a personal choice, but one made by one\u2019s family.\nArranged marriages often ensured proper transference of a family\u2019s wealth and the support of ethnic and religious\ncustoms. Such marriages were considered a marriage of families rather than of individuals. In Western Europe, starting\nin the 18th century, the notion of personal choice in a marital partner slowly became the norm. Arranged marriages were\nseen as \u201ctraditional\u201d and marriages based on love \u201cmodern.\u201d Many of these early \u201clove\u201d marriages were accomplished by\neloping (Thornton, 2005).\nAround the world, more and more young couples are choosing their own partners, even in nations where arranged\nmarriages are still the norm, such as India and Pakistan. Desai and Andrist (2010) found that in India only 5% of the\nwomen they surveyed, aged 25-49, had a primary role in choosing their partner. Only 22% knew their partner for\nmore than one month before they were married. However, the younger cohort of women was more likely to have been\nconsulted by their families before their partner was chosen than were the older cohort, suggesting that family views\nare changing about personal choice. Allendorf (2013) reports that this 5% figure may also underestimate young people\u2019s\nchoice, as only women were surveyed. Many families in India are increasingly allowing sons veto power over the parents\u2019\nchoice of his future spouse, and some families give daughters the same say.\nHappiness and Marital Satisfaction. Although research frequently suggests that marriage is associated with higher\nrates of happiness, this does not guarantee that getting married will make you happy! The quality of one\u2019s marriage\nmatters greatly. When a person remains in a problematic marriage, it takes an emotional toll. Indeed, a large body of\nresearch shows that people\u2019s overall life satisfaction is affected by their satisfaction with their marriage (Umberson,\nWilliams, Powers, Chen, & Campbell, 2005; Proulx, Helms, & Buehler, 2007). Marital satisfaction has peaks and valleys\nduring the course of the family life cycle. Rates of happiness are highest in the years prior to the birth of the first child.\nIt hits a low point with the arrival of the second (or more) child. Children bring new demands and expectations to the\nmarital relationship, along with more financial hardships and stress. Many people who are comfortable with their roles\nas partners find added parental duties and expectations more challenging to meet. Some couples elect not to have\nchildren, for a variety of reasons. These child-free couples, for example, may choose to focus more time and attention\non their partners, careers, and interests.\nGender Role Changes. With the coming of the first child, gender roles in committed relationships typically become more\ntraditional. In western countries, women often take on more domestic responsibilities and childrearing duties at this\ntime (Cooke, 2010; Saginak & Saginak, 2005). for many women, this shift away from a largely egalitarian relationship may\nbe one of the reasons that martial satisfaction suffers. The most egalitarian gender roles typically occur when children\nare older, and in the empty nest stage.\nParenthood\nParenthood is undergoing changes in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Women in the United States have\nfewer children than they did previously, and children are less likely to be living with both parents. The average fertility\nrate of women in the United States was about seven children in the early 1900s and has remained relatively stable at\n322 | Family Life Cycle 2.1 since the 1970s (Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2011; Martinez, Daniels, & Chandra, 2012). Not only are parents having\nfewer children, the context of parenthood has also changed. Parenting outside of marriage has increased dramatically\namong most socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups, although college-educated women are substantially more likely\nto be married at the birth of a child than are mothers with less education (Dye, 2010).\nPeople are having children at older ages, too. This is not surprising given that many of the age markers for adulthood\nhave been delayed, including marriage, completing an education, establishing oneself at work, and gaining financial\nindependence. In 2014, the average age for American first-time mothers was 26.3 years (CDC, 2015). The birth rate for\nwomen in their early 20s has declined in recent years, while the birth rate for women in their late 30s has risen. In\n2011, 40% of births were to women ages 30 and older. For Canadian women, birth rates are even higher for women in\ntheir late 30s than in their early 20s. In 2011, 52% of births were to women ages 30 and older, and the average first-time\nCanadian mother was 28.5 years old (Cohn, 2013). Improved birth control methods have also enabled women to postpone\nmotherhood. Despite the fact that young people are more often delaying childbearing, most 18- to 29-year-olds want to\nhave children and say that being a good parent is one of the most important things in life (Wang & Taylor, 2011).\nInfluences on Parenting. Parenting is a complex process in which parents and children influence one another. There\nare many reasons that parents behave the way they do. The multiple influences on parenting are still being explored.\nProposed influences on parenting include: Parent characteristics, child characteristics, and contextual and sociocultural\ncharacteristics. (Belsky, 1984; Demick, 1999).\nParent Characteristics. Parents bring unique traits and\nqualities to the parenting relationship that affect their decisions\nas parents. These characteristics include the age of the parent,\ngender, beliefs, personality, developmental history, knowledge\nabout parenting and child development, and mental and\nphysical health. Parents\u2019 personalities affect parenting\nbehaviors. Mothers and fathers who are more agreeable,\nconscientious, and outgoing are warmer and provide more\nstructure to their children. Parents who are more agreeable,\nless anxious, and less negative also support their children\u2019s\nautonomy more than parents who are anxious and less\nagreeable (Prinzie, Stams, Dekovic, Reijntes, & Belsky, 2009).\nFigure 8.10 Parents who have these personality traits appear to be better\nable to respond to their children positively and provide a more\nconsistent, structured environment for their children.\nParents\u2019 developmental histories, or their experiences as children, also affect their parenting strategies. Parents may\nlearn parenting practices from their own parents. Fathers whose own parents provided monitoring, consistent and age-\nappropriate discipline, and warmth were more likely to provide this constructive parenting to their own children (Kerr,\nCapaldi, Pears, & Owen, 2009). Patterns of negative parenting and ineffective discipline also appear from one generation\nto the next. However, parents who are dissatisfied with their own parents\u2019 approach may be more likely to change their\nparenting methods with their own children.\nChild Characteristics. Parenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents affect their children, children influence their\nparents. Child characteristics, such as gender, birth order, temperament, and health status, affect parenting behaviors\nand roles. For example, an infant with an easy temperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily\nable to soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive\nreactions from his or her parents and may result in parents feeling less effective in the parenting role (Eisenberg et\nal., 2008). Over time, parents of more difficult children may become more punitive and less patient with their children\n(Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff, Lengua, & Zalewski, 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult\nFamily Life Cycle | 323 child are less satisfied with their marriages and have greater challenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde, Else-\nQuest, & Goldsmith, 2004). Thus, child temperament is one of the child characteristics that influences how parents\nbehave with their children.\nAnother child characteristic is the gender of the child. Parents respond differently to boys and girls. Parents talk\ndifferently with their sons and daughters, providing more scientific explanations to their sons and using more emotion\nwords with their daughters (Crowley, Callanan, Tenenbaum, & Allen, 2001). Parents also often assign different household\nchores to their sons and daughters. Girls are more often responsible for caring for younger siblings and household\nchores, whereas boys are more likely to be asked to perform chores outside the home, such as mowing the lawn (Grusec,\ngoodnow, & Cohen, 1996).\nContextual Factors and Sociocultural Characteristics. The parent\u2013child relationship does not occur in isolation. As\nwe discussed in the previous section on families and parenting, parenting is influenced by higher-order sociocultural\ncontexts. Sociocultural characteristics, including economic hardship, religion, politics, neighborhoods, schools, and\nsocial support, also influence parenting. Parents who experience economic hardship are more easily frustrated,\ndepressed, and sad, and these emotional characteristics affect their parenting skills (Conger & Conger, 2002).\nCulture also influences parenting behaviors in fundamental ways. Although promoting the development of skills\nnecessary to function effectively in one\u2019s community is a universal goal of parenting, the specific skills necessary vary\nwidely from culture to culture. Thus, parents have different goals for their children that partially depend on their\nculture (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2008). Parents vary in how much they emphasize goals for independence and individual\nachievements, maintaining harmonious relationships, and being embedded in a strong network of social relationships.\nCulture is also a contributing contextual factor. For example, Latina mothers who perceived their neighborhood as\nmore dangerous showed less warmth with their children, perhaps because of the greater stress associated with living a\nthreatening environment (Gonzales et al., 2011).\nOther important contextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood, school, and social networks, also affect\nparenting, even though these settings do not always include both the child and the parent (Brofenbrenner, 1989). This\nwould be a good time to go back and re-re the section in Unit 4: Family on higher-order contexts of parenting, and\nthe two papers that examined the ways that poverty and structural racism make parenting more challenging. As you\nmay remember, there are three major ways that status hierarchies, like those organized around class and race, make\nparenting more difficult:\n1. Inequities create objective living conditions that are developmentally hazardous to children and families;\n2. Hardships and discrimination force people to parent under stressful conditions; and\n3. Families must expend effort to counteract the pervasive effects of discrimination and prejudice on the\ndevelopment of their children and adolescents.\nPay special attention to the recommendations provided in that section about how to make higher-order contexts more\nsupportive of the important jobs of parenting and providing for a family, which are challenging tasks even under the best\nof circumstances\nThe many factors that influence parenting are depicted in the following figure.\n324 | Family Life Cycle Figure 8.11. Influences on parenting\nFamily Life in Middle Adulthood\nThe sandwich generation refers to adults who have at\nleast one parent age 65 or older and are either raising their\nown children or providing support for their grown children.\nAccording to a recent Pew Research survey, 47% of\nmiddle-aged adults are part of this sandwich generation\n(Parker & Patten, 2013). In addition, 15% of middle-aged\nadults are providing financial support to an older parent\nwhile raising or supporting their own children (see Figure\n8.12). According to the same survey, almost half (48%) of\nmiddle-aged adults, have supported their adult children\nin the past year, and 27% are the primary source of\nsupport for their grown children.\nSeventy-one percent of the sandwich generation is age\n40-59, 19% were younger than 40, and 10% were 60 or\nFigure 8.12. Source\nolder. Hispanics are more likely to find themselves\nsupporting two generations: 31% have parents 65 or older and a dependent child, compared with 24% of whites and 21%\nof blacks (Parker & Patten, 2013). Women are more likely to take on the role of care provider for older parents in the U.S.\nand Germany (Pew Research, 2015). About 20% of women say they have helped with personal care, such as getting\ndressed or bathing, of aging parents in the past year, compared with 8% of men in the U.S. and 4% in Germany. In\ncontrast, in Italy men are just as likely (25%) as women (26%) to have provided personal care.\nFamily Life Cycle | 325 The Pew survey found that almost 33% of the sandwich-\ngeneration adults were more likely to say they always feel\nrushed, while only 23% of other adults said this. However, the\nsurvey suggests that those who were supporting both parents\nand children reported being just as happy as those middle-\naged adults who did not find themselves in the sandwich\ngeneration (Parker & Patten, 2013). Adults who are supporting\nboth parents and children did report greater financial strain\n(see Figure 8.13). Only 28% reported that they were living\ncomfortably versus 41% of those who were not also\nsupporting their parents. Almost 33% were just making ends\nmeet, compared with 17% of those who did not have the\nadditional financial burden of aging parents.\nEmpty nest. The empty nest, or post-parental period refers to\nthe time period when children are grown up and have left home\n(Dennerstein, Dudley & Guthrie, 2002). For most parents this\noccurs during midlife. This time is recognized as a \u201cnormative\nevent\u201d as parents are aware that their children will become\nadults and eventually leave home (Mitchell & Lovegreen,\nFigure 8.13. Source 2009). The empty nest creates complex emotions, both\npositive and negative, for many parents. Some theorists\nsuggest this is a time of role loss for parents, others suggest it is one of role strain relief (Bouchard, 2013).\nThe role loss hypothesis predicts that when people lose an important role in their life they experience a decrease in\nemotional well-being. It is from this perspective that the concept of the empty nest syndrome emerged, which refers to\ngreat emotional distress experienced by parents, typically mothers, after children have left home. The empty nest syndrome\nis linked to the absence of alternative roles for the parent in which they could establish their identity (Borland, 1982). In\nBouchard\u2019s (2013) review of the research, she found that few parents reported loneliness or a big sense of loss once all\ntheir children had left home.\nIn contrast, the role stress relief hypothesis suggests that the empty nest period should lead to more positive changes\nfor parents, as the responsibility of raising children has been lifted. The role strain relief hypothesis was supported by\nmany studies in Bouchard\u2019s (2013) review. A consistent finding throughout the research literature is that raising children\nhas a negative impact on the quality of martial relationships (Ahlborg, Misvaer, & M\u00f6ller, 2009; Bouchard, 2013). Most\nstudies report that martial satisfaction often increases during the launching phase of the empty nest period, and that\nthis satisfaction endures long after the last child has left home (Gorchoff, John, & Helson, 2008).\nHowever, most of the research on the post-parental period has been with American parents. A number of studies in\nChina suggest that empty-nesters, especially in more rural areas of China, report greater loneliness and depression\nthan their counterparts with children still at home (Wu et al., 2010). Family support for the elderly by their children is a\ncherished Chinese tradition (Wong & Leung, 2012). The fact that children move from the rural communities to the larger\ncities for education and employment may explain the more negative reaction of Chinese parents compared to American\nsamples. The loss of an adult child in a rural region may mean a loss of family income and support for aging parents.\nEmpty-nesters in urban regions of China did not report the same degree of distress (Su et al., 2012), suggesting that it\nnot so much the event of children leaving, but the additional hardships this may place on aging parents.\n326 | Family Life Cycle Boomerang Kids. Young adults are living with their parents for a longer duration\nand in greater numbers than previous generations. In addition to those in early\nadulthood who are not leaving the home of their parents, there are\nalso boomerang kids, a term used to refer to young adults who return after having\nlived independently outside the home. The first Figure 8.14 shows the number of\nAmerican young people 25-35 who were living at home based on their generation\n(Fry, 2017). The second Figure 8.15 with the European map, shows that more young\nadults 18-34 in Europe are also living with their parents (Desilver, 2016). Many of\nthe same financial reasons that are influencing young people\u2019s decisions to delay\nexit from the home of their parents are underlying their decisions to return home.\nIn addition, to financial reasons, some boomerang kids are returning because of\nemotional distress, such as mental health issues (Sandberg-Thoma, Snyder, &\nJang, 2015).\nWhat is the effect\non parents when\ntheir adult children\nreturn home?\nCertainly, there is\nconsiderable\nresearch that\nshows that the\nstress of raising\nchildren can have a\nnegative impact on\nparents\u2019 well-\nFigure 8.14\nbeing, and that\nwhen children leave home many couples experience less\nstress and greater life satisfaction (see the section on the\nempty nest). Early research in the 1980s and 1990s\nsupported the notion that boomerang children, along\nwith those who were failing to exit the home, placed\ngreater financial hardship on the parents, and the parents\nreported more negative perceptions of this living\narrangement (Aquilino, 1991).\nRecent surveys suggest that today\u2019s parents are more\ntolerant of this, perhaps because this is becoming a more\nnormative experience than in the past. Moreover,\nchildren who return are more likely to have had good\nrelationships with their parents growing up, so there may\nbe less stress between parents and their adult children\nwho return (Sandberg-Thoma et al., 2015). Parents of\nyoung adults who have moved back home because of\nFigure 8.15\neconomic reasons report that they are just as satisfied\nwith their life as are parents whose adult children are still living independently (Parker, 2012). Parker found that adult\nchildren age 25 and older are more likely to contribute financially to the family or complete chores and other household\nduties. Parker also found that living in a multigenerational household may be acting as an economic safety net for young\nFamily Life Cycle | 327 adults. In comparison to young adults who were living outside of the home, those living with their parents were less\nlikely to be living in poverty (17% versus 10%).\nSo far, we have considered the impact that adult children who have returned home or have yet to leave the nest\nhave on the lives of middle-aged parents. What about the effect on parents who have adult children dealing with\npersonal problems, such as alcoholism, chronic health concerns, mental health issues, trouble with the law, poor social\nrelationships, or academic or job-related problems, even if they are not living at home? The life course perspective\nproposes the idea of linked lives (Greenfield & Marks, 2006). The notion that people in important relationships, such\nas children and parents, mutually influence each other\u2019s developmental pathways. In previous chapters you have read\nabout the effects that parents have on their children\u2019s development, but this relationship is bidirectional. The problems\nfaced by children, even when those children are adults, influence the lives of their parents. Greenfield and Marks\nfound in their study of middle-aged parents and their adult children, those parents whose children were dealing with\npersonal problems reported more negative affect, lower self-acceptance, poorer parent-child interactions, and more\nfamily relationship stress. The more problems the adult children were facing, the worse the lives and emotional health\nof their parents, with single parents faring the worst.\nCommitted Relationships in Middle Adulthood\nSinglehood. According to a Pew Research study, 16 per 1,000 adults age 45 to 54 and 7 per 1000 age 55 and over have\nnever-married in the U. S. (Wang & Parker, 2014). However, some of them may be living with a partner. In addition, some\nsingles at midlife may be single through divorce or widowhood. DePaulo (2014) has challenged the idea that singles,\nespecially the always single, fare worse emotionally and in health when compared to those married. DePaulo suggests\nthere is a bias in how studies examine the benefits of marriage. Most studies focus on comparisons between married\nversus not married, which do not include a separate comparison between those always single, and those who are single\nbecause of divorce or widowhood. Her research has found that those who are married may be more satisfied with\nlife than the divorced or widowed, but there is little difference between married and always single, especially when\ncomparing those who are recently married with those who have been married for four or more years. It appears that\nonce the initial blush of the honeymoon wears off, those who are wedded are no happier or healthier than those who\nremained single. This also suggests that it could be problematic for studies to consider the \u201cmarried\u201d category to be a\nhomogeneous group.\nOnline Dating. Montenegro (2003) surveyed over 3,000 singles aged 40\u201369, and almost half of the participants reported\ntheir most important reason for dating was to have someone to talk to or do things with. Additionally, sexual fulfillment\nwas also identified as an important goal for many. Alterovitz and Mendelsohn (2013) reviewed online personal ads for\nmen and women over age 40 and found that romantic activities and sexual interests were mentioned at similar rates\namong the middle-age and young-old age groups, but less for the old-old age group.\n328 | Family Life Cycle Marriage. Trends seen in early adulthood also show up in\nrelationships during middle adulthood, including declines\nin the rate of marriage, as more people are cohabitating,\nmore are deciding to stay single, and more are getting\nmarried at a later age. As you can see in the Figure 8.16,\n48% of adults age 45-54 are married; either in their first\nmarriage (22%) or have remarried (26%). This makes\nmarriage the most common relationship status for\nmiddle-aged adults in the United States.\nMarital satisfaction tends to increase for many couples in\nmidlife as children are leaving home (Landsford,\nAntonucci, Akiyama, & Takahashi, 2005). Not all\nresearchers agree. They suggest that those who are\nunhappy with their marriage are likely to have gotten\ndivorced by now, making the quality of marriages later in\nlife only look more satisfactory (Umberson, Williams,\nPowers, Chen, & Campbell, 2005).\nFigure 8.16\nDivorce. Livingston (2014) found that 27% of adults age 45\nto 54 were divorced (see Figure 8.32). Additionally, 57% of divorced adults were women. This reflects the fact that men\nare more likely to remarry than are women. Two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women (AARP, 2009). Most divorces\ntake place within the first 5 to 10 years of marriage. This time line reflects people\u2019s initial attempts to salvage the\nrelationship. After a few years of limited success, the couple may decide to end the marriage. It used to be that divorce\nafter having been married for 20 or more years was rare, but in recent years the divorce rate among more long-term\nmarriages has been increasing. Brown and Lin (2013) note that while the divorce rate in the U.S. has declined since the\n1990s, the rate among those 50 and older has doubled.\nThey suggest several reasons for the \u201cgraying of divorce\u201d. There is less stigma attached to divorce today than in the past.\nSome older women are out-earning their spouses, and thus may be more financially capable of supporting themselves,\nespecially as most of their children have grown. Finally, given increases in human longevity, the prospect of living several\nmore years or decades with an incompatible spouse may prompt middle-aged and older adults to leave the marriage.\nGottman and Levenson (2000) found that divorces in early adulthood were angrier and more conflictual, with each\npartner blaming the other for the failures in the marriage. In contrast, they found that at midlife divorces tended to be\nmore about having grown apart, or a cooling off of the relationship.\nA survey by AARP (2009) found that men and women had diverse motivations for getting a divorce. Women reported\nconcerns about the verbal and physical abusiveness of their partner (23%), drug/alcohol abuse (18%), and infidelity (17%).\nIn contrast, men mentioned they had simply fallen out of love (17%), no longer shared interests or values (14%), and\ninfidelity (14%). Both genders felt their marriage had been over long before the decision to divorce was made, with many\nof the middle-aged adults in the survey reporting that they stayed together because they were still raising children.\nFemales also indicated that they remained in their marriage due to financial concerns, including the loss of health care\n(Sohn, 2015). However, only 1 in 4 adults regretted their decision to divorce.\nThe effects of divorce are varied. Overall, young adults struggle more with the consequences of divorce than do those\nat midlife, as they have a higher risk of depression or other signs of problems with psychological adjustment (Birditt &\nAntonucci, 2013). Divorce at midlife is more stressful for women. In the AARP (2009) survey, 44% of middle-aged women\nmentioned financial problems after divorcing their spouse; in comparison, only 11% of men reported such difficulties.\nHowever, a number of women who divorce in midlife report that they felt a great release from their day-to-day sense of\nunhappiness. Hetherington and Kelly (2002) found that among the divorce enhancers, those who had used the experience\nFamily Life Cycle | 329 to better themselves and seek more productive intimate relationships, and the competent loners, those who used their\ndivorce experience to grow emotionally, but who choose to stay single, the overwhelming majority were women.\nDating Post-Divorce. Most divorced adults have dated by one year after filing for divorce (Anderson et al., 2004;\nAnderson & Greene, 2011). One in four recent filers report having been in or were currently in a serious relationship, and\nover half were in a serious relationship by one year after filing for divorce. Not surprisingly, younger adults were more\nlikely to be dating than were middle aged or older adults, no doubt due to the larger pool of potential partners from\nwhich they could to draw. Of course, these relationships will not all end in marriage. Teachman (2008) found that more\nthan two thirds of women under the age of 45 had cohabited with a partner between their first and second marriages.\nDating for adults with children can be more of a challenge. Courtships are shorter in remarriage than in first marriages.\nWhen couples are \u201cdating\u201d, there is less going out and more time spent in activities at home or with the children. So, the\ncouple gets less time together to focus on their relationship. Anxiety or memories of past relationships can also get in\nthe way. As one Talmudic scholar suggests \u201cwhen a divorced man marries a divorced woman, four go to bed\u201d (Secombe\n& Warner, 2004).\nPost-divorce parents gatekeep, that is, they regulate the flow of information about their new romantic partner to their\nchildren, in an attempt to balance their own needs for romance with consideration regarding the needs and reactions\nof their children. Anderson et al. (2004) found that almost half (47%) of dating parents gradually introduce their children\nto their dating partner, giving both their romantic partner and children time to adjust and get to know each other.\nMany parents who use this approach do so to protect their children from having to keep meeting someone new until\nit becomes clear that this relationship might be a lasting one. It might also help if the adult relationship is on firmer\nground so it can weather any initial push back from children when it is revealed. Forty percent of people are open and\ntransparent with their children about the new relationship right from the outset. Thirteen percent do not reveal the\nrelationship until it is clear that cohabitation and or remarriage is likely. Anderson and colleagues suggest that practical\nmatters influence which gatekeeping method parents may use. Parents may be able to successfully shield their children\nfrom a parade of partners if there is reliable childcare available. The age and temperament of the child, along with\nconcerns about the reaction of the ex-spouse, may also influence when parents reveal their romantic relationships to\ntheir children.\n330 | Family Life Cycle Rates of re-marriage. The rate for remarriage, like the rate\nfor marriage, has been declining overall. In 2013 the\nremarriage rate was approximately 28 per 1,000 adults 18 and\nolder. This represents a 44% decline since 1990 and a 16%\ndecline since 2008 (Payne, 2015). Brown and Lin (2013) found\nthat the rate of remarriage dropped more for younger adults\nthan middle aged and older adults, and Livingston (2014)\nfound that as we age, we are more likely to have remarried\n(see Figure 8.17). This is not surprising as it takes some time to\nmarry, divorce, and then find someone else to marry.\nHowever, Livingston found that unlike those younger than 55,\nthose 55 and up are remarrying at a higher rate than in the\npast. In 2013, 67% of adults 55-64 and 50% of adults 65 and\nolder had remarried, up from 55% and 34% in 1960,\nrespectively.\nMen have a higher rate of remarriage at every age group\nstarting at age 25 (Payne, 2015). Livingston (2014) reported\nthat in 2013, 64% of divorced or widowed men compared with\n52% of divorced or widowed women had remarried. However,\nthis gender gap has narrowed over time. Even though more\nmen still remarry, they are remarrying at a slower rate. In\ncontrast, women are remarrying today more than they did in Figure 8.17\n1980. This gender gap has closed mostly among young and\nmiddle-aged adults, but still persists among those 65 and older.\nIn 2012, Whites who were previously married were more likely to remarry than were other racial and ethnic groups\n(Livingston, 2014). Moreover, the rate of remarriage has increased among Whites, while the rate of remarriage has\ndeclined for other racial and ethnic groups. This increase is driven by White women, whose rate of remarriage has\nincreased, while the rate for White males has declined.\nSuccess of Re-marriage. Research is mixed as to the happiness and success of\nremarriages. While some remarriages are more successful, especially if the\ndivorce motivated the adult to engage in self-improvement and personal growth\n(Hetherington & Kelly, 2002), a number of divorced adults end up in very similar\nmarriages the second or third time around (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002).\nRemarriages have challenges not found in first marriages and they can create\nadditional stress in the marital relationship.\nThere can also be a general lack of clarity in family roles and expectations when\ntrying to incorporate new kin into the family structure. Even determining the\nappropriate terms for these kin, along with their roles, can be a\nchallenge. Partners may have to carefully navigate their role when dealing with\ntheir partners\u2019 children. All of this may lead to greater dissatisfaction and even\nresentment among family members. Even though remarried couples tend to have\nmore realistic expectations for marriage, they tend to be less willing to stay in\nunhappy situations. The rate of divorce among remarriages is higher than among\nfirst marriages (Payne, 2015), which can add additional burdens, especially when\nFigure 8.18\nchildren are involved.\nFamily Life Cycle | 331 Children\u2019s Influence on Re-partnering. Do children affect whether a parent remarries? Goldscheider and Sassler (2006)\nfound children residing with their mothers reduces the mothers\u2019 likelihood of marriage, only with respect to marrying\na man without children. Further, having children in the home appears to increase single men\u2019s likelihood of marrying a\nwoman with children (Stewart, Manning, & Smock, 2003). There is also some evidence that individuals who participated\nin a stepfamily while growing up may feel better prepared for stepfamily living as adults. Goldscheider and Kaufman\n(2006) found that having experienced family divorce as a child is associated with a greater willingness to marry a partner\nwith children.\nWhen children are present after divorce, one of the challenges\nthe adults encounter is how much influence the child will have\nin the selection a new partner. Greene, Anderson,\nHetherington, Forgatch, and DeGarmo (2003) identified two\ntypes of parents. The child-focused parent allows the child\u2019s\nviews, reactions, and needs to influence the repartnering. In\ncontrast, the adult-focused parent expects that their child can\nadapt and should accommodate to parental wishes. Anderson\nand Greene (2011) found that divorced custodial mothers\nidentified as more adult focused tended to be older, more\neducated, employed, and more likely to have been married\nFigure 8.19\nlonger. Additionally, adult-focused mothers reported having\nless rapport with their children, spent less time in joint activities with their children, and the child reported lower\nrapport with their mothers. Lastly, when the child and partner were resisting one another, adult-focused mothers\nresponded more to the concerns of the partner, while the child-focused mothers responded more to the concerns of\nthe child. Understanding the implications of these two differing perspectives can assist parents in their attempts to\nrepartner.\nGrandparents\nIn addition to maintaining relationships with their children and aging parents, many people in middle adulthood take\non yet another role, becoming a grandparent. The role of grandparent varies around the world. In multigenerational\nhouseholds, grandparents may play a greater role in the day-to-day activities of their grandchildren. While this family\ndynamic is more common in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, it has been on the increase in the U.S. (Pew Research Center,\n2010). Around the world, even when not cohabitating with their children and grandchildren, grandparents are usually a\nmajor source of support for new parents and young families.\n332 | Family Life Cycle The degree of grandparent involvement depends on the\nproximity of the grandparents\u2019 home to the grandchildren. In\ndeveloped nations, greater societal mobility means that many\ngrandparents live long distances from their grandchildren.\nTechnology has brought grandparents and their more distant\ngrandchildren together. Sorenson and Cooper (2010) found that\nmany of the grandfathers they interviewed would text, email, or\nSkype with their grandchildren in order to stay in touch.\nCherlin and Furstenberg (1986) described three styles of\ngrandparents. Thirty percent of grandparents were remote\nbecause they rarely saw their grandchildren. Usually they lived\nFigure 8.20. Grandparents are an important source of support\nfar away from the grandchildren but may also have had a distant\nfor young families\nrelationship. Contact was typically made on special occasions,\nsuch as holidays or birthdays. Fifty-five percent of grandparents were described as companionate because they did\nthings with their grandchildren but had little authority or control over them. They preferred to spend time with them\nwithout interfering in parenting. They were more like friends to their grandchildren. Fifteen percent of grandparents\nwere described as involved because they took a very active role in their grandchild\u2019s life. The involved grandparent had\nfrequent contact with and authority over the grandchild, and their grandchildren might even live with them. Depending\non the circumstances (which sometimes involve problems with the grandchildren\u2019s parents, such as illness or addiction),\ntaking over the parenting role for grandchildren can be stressful or it can be rewarding, or both. Grandmothers, more\nso than grandfathers, played this role. In contrast, more grandfathers than grandmothers saw their role as family\nhistorian and family advisor (Neugarten and Weinstein, 1964). Bengtson (2001) suggests that grandparents adopt\ndifferent styles with different grandchildren, and over time may change styles as circumstances in the family change.\nToday more grandparents are the sole care providers for grandchildren or may step in at times of crisis.\nFamily Caregivers\nA disabled child, spouse, parent, or other family member is part of the lives of some midlife adults. According to the\nNational Alliance for Caregiving (2015), 40 million Americans provide unpaid caregiving for family members. The typical\ncaregiver is a 49-year-old female currently caring for a 69 year-old female who needs care because of a long-term\nphysical condition. Looking more closely at the age of the recipient of caregiving, the typical caregiver for those 18-49\nyears of age is a female (61%) caring mostly for her own child (32%) followed by a spouse or partner (17%). When looking\nat older recipients (50+) who receive care, the typical caregiver is female (60%) caring for a parent (47%) or spouse (10%).\nCaregiving places an enormous burden on the caregiver, and is one of the most demanding and stressful roles\nthat people can take on. Caregiving for a young or adult child with special needs is associated with poorer global\nhealth and more physical symptoms among both fathers and mothers (Seltzer, Floyd, Song, Greenberg, & Hong, 2011).\nMarital relationships are also a factor in how caregiving affects stress and chronic conditions. Fathers who were\ncaregivers reported more chronic health conditions than non-caregiving fathers, regardless of marital quality. In\ncontrast, caregiving mothers reported higher levels of chronic conditions when they also reported a high level of marital\nstrain (Kang & Marks, 2014). Age can also make a difference in how one is affected by the stress of caring for a child\nwith special needs. Using data from the Study of Midlife in the Unites States, Ha, Hong, Seltzer and Greenberg (2008)\nfound that older parents were significantly less likely to experience the negative effects of having a disabled child than\nyounger parents. They concluded that an age-related weakening of the stress occurred over time, as other non-disabled\nchildren became independent and left home. The general trend of greater emotional stability noted at midlife may also\nhave played a role.\nFamily Life Cycle | 333 Currently 25% of adult children, mainly baby boomers, provide personal or financial care to a parent (Metlife, 2011).\nDaughters are more likely to provide basic care and sons are more likely to provide financial assistance. Adult children\n50+ who work and provide care to a parent are more likely to have fair or poor health when compared to those who\ndo not provide care. Some adult children choose to leave the work force to care for a parent, however, the cost of\nleaving the work force early is high. For females, lost wages and social security benefits equals $324,044, while for men\nit equals $283,716 (Metlife, 2011). This loss can jeopardize the adult child\u2019s financial future. Consequently, there is a need\nfor greater workplace flexibility for working caregivers.\nSpousal Care. Certainly, caring for a disabled spouse can be a difficult experience that can negatively affect one\u2019s health.\nHowever, research indicates that there can also be positive health effects for caring for a disabled spouse. Beach, Schulz,\nYee and Jackson (2000) evaluated health related outcomes in four groups: Spouses with no caregiving needed (Group 1),\nliving with a disabled spouse but not providing care (Group 2), living with a disabled spouse and providing care (Group 3),\nand helping a disabled spouse while reporting caregiver strain, including elevated levels of emotional and physical stress\n(Group 4). Not surprisingly, the participants in Group 4 were the least healthy and identified poorer perceived health,\nan increase in health-risk behaviors, and an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms. However, those in Group\n3 who provided care for a spouse, but did not identify caregiver strain, actually reported decreased levels of anxiety\nand depression compared to Group 2 and were actually similar to those in Group 1. It appears that greater caregiving\ninvolvement was related to better mental health as long as the caregiving spouse did not feel strain. The beneficial\neffects of helping reported by the participants were consistent with previous research (Krause, Herzog, & Baker, 1992;\nSchulz et al., 1997).\nWhen caring for a disabled spouse, gender differences have also been found. Female caregivers of a spouse with\ndementia experienced more burden, had poorer mental and physical health, exhibited increased depressive\nsymptomatology, took part in fewer health-promoting activities, and received fewer hours of help than male caregivers\n(Gibbons et al., 2014). This study was consistent with previous research findings that women experience more caregiving\nburden than men, despite similar caregiving situations (Torti, Gwyther, Reed, Friedman, & Schulman, 2004; Yeager, Hyer,\nHobbs, & Coyne, 2010). A primary factor contributing to women\u2019s poorer caregiving outcomes is that disabled males\nare more aggressive than females, especially males with dementia who display more physical and sexual aggression\ntoward their caregivers (Eastley & Wilcock, 1997; Zuidema, de Jonghe, Verhey, & Koopmans, 2009). Explanations for why\nwomen are not offered or do not use more external support, which may alleviate some of the burden, include society\u2019s\nexpectations that they should assume caregiving roles (Torti et al, 2004) and women\u2019s concerns with the opinions of\nothers (Arai, Sugiura, Miura, Washio, & Kudo, 2000). Female caregivers are certainly at risk for negative consequences\nof caregiving, and greater support needs to be available to them.\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine (2015), it is estimated that 66 million Americans, or 29% of the adult population,\nare caregivers for someone who is dying or chronically ill. Two-thirds of these caregivers are women. This care takes\nits toll physically, emotionally, and financially. Family caregivers may face the physical challenges of lifting, dressing,\nfeeding, bathing, and transporting a dying or ill family member. They may worry about whether they are performing all\ntasks safely and properly, as they receive little training or guidance. Such caregiving tasks may also interfere with their\nability to take care of themselves and meet other family and workplace obligations. Financially, families often face high\nout of pocket expenses (IOM, 2015).\nAs can be seen in the table below, most family caregivers are providing care by themselves with little professional\nintervention, are employed, and have provided care for more than 3 years. In 2013, the annual loss of productivity in the\nU.S. was $25 billion as a result of work absenteeism due to providing this care. As the prevalence of chronic disease rises,\nthe need for family caregivers is growing. Unfortunately, the number of potential family caregivers is declining as the\nlarge baby boomer generation enters into late adulthood (Redfoot, Feinberg, & Houser, 2013).\n334 | Family Life Cycle Table 8.5 Characteristics of family caregivers in the United States\nCharacteristic Percentages\nNo home visits by health care professionals 69%\nCaregivers are also employed 72%\nDuration of employed workers who have been caregiving for 3+ years 55%\nCaregivers for the elderly 67%\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French, 2019 and IOM, 2015\nFriendships in Middle Adulthood\nAdults of all ages who reported having a confidante or close friend with whom they could share personal feelings\nand concerns, believed these friends contributed to a sense of belonging, security, and overall wellbeing (Dun\u00e9r &\nNordstrom, 2007). Having a close friend is a factor in significantly lower odds of psychiatric morbidity including\ndepression and anxiety (Harrison, Barrow, Gask, & Creed, 1999; Newton et al., 2008). The availability of a close friend has\nalso been shown to lessen the adverse effects of stress on health (Kouzis & Eaton, 1998; Hawkley et al., 2008; Tower &\nKasl, 1995). Additionally, poor social connectedness in adulthood is associated with a larger risk of premature mortality\nthan cigarette smoking, obesity, and excessive alcohol use (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010).\nFemale friendships and social support networks at midlife\ncontribute significantly to a woman\u2019s feeling of life satisfaction\nand well-being (Borzumato-Gainey, Kennedy, McCabe, &\nDegges-White, 2009). Degges-White and Myers (2006) found\nthat women who have supportive people in their lives\nexperience greater life satisfaction than do those who live a\nmore solitary life. A friendship network or the presence of a\nconfidante have both been found to be important to women\u2019s\nFigure 8.21. Importance of friendships in middle adulthood mental health (Baruch & Brooks-Gunn, 1984). Unfortunately,\nwith numerous caretaking responsibilities at home, it may be\ndifficult for women to find time and energy to enhance the friendships that would provide an increased sense of life\nsatisfaction (Borzumato-Gainey et al., 2009). Emslie, Hunt and Lyons (2013) found that for men in midlife, the shared\nconsumption of alcohol was important to creating and maintaining male friends. Drinking with friends was justified as a\nway for men to talk to each other, provide social support, relax, and improve mood. Although the social support provided\nwhen men drink together can be helpful, the role of alcohol in male friendships can lead to health damaging behavior\nfrom excessive drinking.\nThe importance of social relationships begins in early adulthood by laying down a foundation for strong social\nconnectedness and facilitating comfort with intimacy (Erikson, 1959). To determine the impact of the quantity and\nquality of social relationships in young adulthood on middle adulthood, Carmichael, Reis, and Duberstein (2015) assessed\nindividuals at age 50 on measures of social connection (types of relationships and friendship quality) and psychological\noutcomes (loneliness, depression, psychological well-being). Results indicated that the quantity of social interactions\nat age 20 and the quality, but not quantity, of social interaction at age 30 predicted midlife social interactions. Those\nindividuals who had high levels of social information seeking (quantity) at age 20 followed by fewer social relationships\nbut greater emotional closeness (quality), ended up showing the most positive psychosocial adjustment at midlife.\nFamily Life Cycle | 335 References\nAARP.

This stage\nincludes the generation of new beings, new ideas or creations, and lasting contributions, as well as self-generation\nconcerned with further identity development. Erikson believed that the stage of generativity, which lasts from the 40s\nto the 60s, during which one established a family and career, was the longest of all the stages. Individuals at midlife\nare primarily concerned with leaving a positive legacy of themselves, and parenthood is the primary generative type.\n344 | Middle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality Erikson understood that work and family relationships may be in conflict due to the obligations and responsibilities of\neach, but he believed it was overall a positive developmental time. In addition to being parents and working, Erikson also\ndescribed individuals as being involved in the community during this stage, for example, providing mentoring, coaching,\ncommunity service, or taking leadership in church or other community organizations. A sense of stagnation occurs\nwhen one is not active in generative matters, however, stagnation can motive a person to redirect energies into more\nmeaningful activities.\nErikson identified \u201cvirtues\u201d for each of his eight stages, and the virtue emerging when one achieves generativity is \u201ccare\u201d.\nErikson believed that those in middle adulthood should \u201ctake care of the persons, the products, and the ideas one\nhas learned to care for\u201d (Erikson, 1982, p. 67). Further, Erikson believed that the strengths gained from the six earlier\nstages are essential for the generational task of cultivating strength in the next generation. Erikson further argued that\ngenerativity occurred best after the individual had resolved issues of identity and intimacy (Peterson & Duncan, 2007).\nResearch has demonstrated that generative adults possess many positive characteristics, including good cultural\nknowledge and healthy adaptation to the world (Peterson & Duncan, 2007). Using the Big 5 personality traits, generative\nwomen and men scored high on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, and low on\nneuroticism (de St. Aubin & McAdams, 1995; Peterson, Smirles, & Wentworth, 1997). Additionally, women scoring higher\non generativity at age 52, were rated higher in positive personality characteristics, reported higher satisfaction with\nmarriage and motherhood, and showed more successful aging at age 62 (Peterson & Duncan, 2007). Similarly, men rated\nhigher on generativity at midlife also showed stronger global cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, calculation),\nstronger executive functioning (e.g., response inhibition, abstract thinking, cognitive flexibility), and lower levels of\ndepression in late adulthood (Malone, Liu, Vaillant, Rentz, & Waldinger, 2016).\nErikson (1982) indicated that at the end of this demanding stage, individuals may withdraw as generativity is no longer\nexpected in late adulthood. This releases elders from the task of caretaking or working. However, not feeling needed\nor challenged may result in stagnation, and consequently one should not fully withdraw from generative tasks as they\nenter Erikson\u2019s last stage in late adulthood.\nChallenges at Midlife\nThere are many socioemotional changes that occur in how middle-aged adults perceive themselves. While people in\ntheir early 20s may emphasize how old they are to gain respect or to be viewed as experienced, by the time people\nreach their 40s they tend to emphasize how young they are. For instance, few 40-year olds cut each other down for\nbeing so young stating: \u201cYou\u2019re only 43? I\u2019m 48!\u201d A previous focus on the future gives way to an emphasis on the present.\nNeugarten (1968) notes that in midlife, people no longer think of their lives in terms of how long they have lived. Rather,\nlife is thought of in terms of how many years are left.\nMiddle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality | 345 Midlife Crisis? Daniel Levinson\u2019s 1978 book entitled The Seasons\nof a Man\u2019s Life presented a theory of development in adulthood.\nLevinson\u2019s work was based on in-depth interviews with 40 men\nbetween the ages of 35-45. Levinson (1978) indicated that adults\ngo through stages and have an image of the future that\nmotivates them. This image is called \u201cthe dream\u201d and for the\nmen interviewed, it was a dream of how their career paths\nwould progress and where they would be at midlife. According\nto Levinson the midlife transition (40-45) was a time of\nreevaluating previous commitments; making dramatic changes\nif necessary; giving expression to previously ignored talents or\nFigure 9.1 aspirations; and feeling more of a sense of urgency about life\nand its meaning. By the time these men entered middle\nadulthood (45-50), they generally had committed to the new choices they made and channeled their energies into these\ncommitments.\nLevinson believed that a midlife crisis was a normal part of development as the person is more aware of how much time\nhas gone by and how much time is left. The future focus of early adulthood gives way to an emphasis on the present\nin midlife, and the men interviewed had difficulty reconciling the \u201cdream\u201d they held about the future with the reality they\ncurrently experienced. Consequently, they felt impatient and were no longer willing to postpone the things they had\nalways wanted to do. Although Levinson believed his research demonstrated the existence of a midlife crisis, his work\nhas been criticized for its research methodology, including its focus on men only, its small sample size, narrow age\nrange, and concerns about a cohort effect. In fact, other research does not support his theory of the midlife crisis.\nVaillant (2012) believed that it was the cross-sectional design of Levinson\u2019s study that led to the erroneous conclusion\nof an inevitable midlife crisis. Instead, he believed that the longitudinal study of an individual\u2019s entire life was needed\nto determine the factors associated with optimum health and potential. Vaillant was one of the main researchers in the\n75 year long Harvard Study of Adult Development, and he considered a midlife crisis to be a rare occurrence among the\nparticipants (Vaillant, 1977). Additional findings of this longitudinal study will be discussed in the next chapter on late\nadulthood.\nMost research suggests that the majority of people in the United States today do not experience a midlife crisis.\nResults of a 10-year longitudinal study conducted by the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife\nDevelopment, based on telephone interviews with over 3,000 midlife adults, suggest that the years between 40 and 60\nare typically marked by a sense of well-being. Only 23% of their participants reported experiencing a midlife crisis. The\ncrisis tended to occur among highly educated men and was typically triggered by a major life event rather than out of a\nfear of aging (Research Network on Successful Midlife Development, 2007).\nIntelligence in Middle Adulthood\nThe brain at midlife has been shown to not only maintain many of the abilities of young adults, but also gain new ones.\nSome individuals in middle age actually have improved cognitive functioning (Phillips, 2011). The brain continues to\ndemonstrate plasticity and rewires itself in middle age based on experiences. Research has demonstrated that older\nadults use more of their brains than younger adults. In fact, older adults who perform the best on tasks are more likely\nto demonstrate bilateralization than those who perform worst. Additionally, the amount of white matter in the brain,\nwhich is responsible for forming connections among neurons, increases into the 50s before it declines.\n346 | Middle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality Emotionally, the middle-aged brain is calmer, less neurotic, more capable of managing emotions, and better able to\nnegotiate social situations (Phillips, 2011). Older adults tend to focus more on positive information and less on negative\ninformation than do younger adults. In fact, they also remember positive images better than those younger. Additionally,\nthe older adult\u2019s amygdala responds less to negative stimuli. Lastly, adults in middle adulthood make better financial\ndecisions, a capacity which seems to peak at age 53, and show better economic understanding. Although greater\ncognitive variability occurs among middle aged adults when compared to those both younger and older, those in midlife\nwho experience cognitive improvements tend to be more physically, cognitively, and socially active.\nCrystalized versus Fluid Intelligence. Intelligence is influenced by heredity, culture, social contexts, personal choices,\nand certainly age. One distinction in specific intelligences noted in adulthood, is between fluid intelligence, which refers\nto the capacity to learn new ways of solving problems and performing activities quickly and abstractly, and crystallized\nintelligence, which refers to the accumulated knowledge of the world we have acquired throughout our lives (Salthouse,\n2004). These intelligences are distinct, and show different developmental pathways as pictured in Figure 9.2. Fluid\nintelligence tends to decrease with age (staring in the late 20s to early 30s), whereas crystallized intelligence generally\nincreases all across adulthood (Horn, Donaldson, & Engstrom, 1981; Salthouse, 2004).\nFluid intelligence, sometimes called the mechanics of intelligence, tends to rely on perceptual speed of processing,\nand perceptual speed is one of the primary capacities that shows age-graded declines starting in early adulthood,\nas seen not only in cognitive tasks but also in athletic performance and other tasks that require speed. In contrast,\nresearch demonstrates that crystallized intelligence, also called the pragmatics of intelligence, continues to grow all\nduring adulthood, as older adults acquire additional semantic knowledge, vocabulary, and language. As a result, adults\ngenerally outperform younger people on tasks where this information is useful, such as measures of history, geography,\nand even on crossword puzzles (Salthouse, 2004). It is this superior knowledge, combined with a slower and more\ncomplete processing style, along with a more sophisticated understanding of the workings of the world around them,\nthat gives older adults the advantage of \u201cwisdom\u201d over the advantages of fluid intelligence which favor the young (Baltes,\nStaudinger, & Lindenberger, 1999; Scheibe, Kunzmann, & Baltes, 2009).\nMiddle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality | 347 Figure 9.2\nThese differential changes in crystallized versus fluid intelligence help explain why older adults do not necessarily show\npoorer performance on tasks that also require experience (i.e., crystallized intelligence), although they show poorer\nmemory overall. A young chess player may think more quickly, for instance, but a more experienced chess player has\nmore knowledge to draw upon.\nSeattle Longitudinal Study. The Seattle Longitudinal Study has tracked the cognitive abilities of adults since 1956. Every\nseven years the current participants are evaluated, and new individuals are also added. Approximately 6000 people have\nparticipated thus far, and 26 people from the original group are still in the study today. Current results demonstrate that\nmiddle-aged adults perform better on four out of six cognitive tasks than those same individuals did when they were\nyoung adults. Verbal memory, spatial skills, inductive reasoning (generalizing from particular examples), and vocabulary\nincrease with age until one\u2019s 70s (Schaie, 2005; Willis & Shaie, 1999). In contrast, perceptual speed declines starting in\nearly adulthood, and numerical computation shows declines starting in middle and late adulthood (see Figure 9.3).\n348 | Middle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality Figure 9.3. Seattle longitudinal study results\nCognitive skills in the aging brain have been studied extensively in pilots, and similar to the Seattle Longitudinal Study\nresults, older pilots show declines in processing speed and memory capacity, but their overall performance seems to\nremain intact. According to Phillips (2011) researchers tested pilots age 40 to 69 as they performed on flight simulators.\nOlder pilots took longer to learn to use the simulators but subsequently performed better than younger pilots at\navoiding collisions.\nTacit knowledge is knowledge that is pragmatic or practical and learned through experience rather than explicitly taught,\nand it also increases with age (Hedlund, Antonakis, & Sternberg, 2002). Tacit knowledge might be thought of as \u201cknow-\nhow\u201d or \u201cprofessional instinct.\u201d It is referred to as tacit because it cannot be codified or written down. It does not involve\nacademic knowledge, rather it involves being able to use skills and to problem-solve in practical ways. Tacit knowledge\ncan be seen clearly in the workplace and underlies the steady improvements in job performance documented across\nage and experience, as seen for example, in the performance of both white and blue collar workers, such as carpenters,\nchefs, and hair dressers.\nMiddle Adults Returning to College. Midlife adults in the United States often find themselves in university classrooms.\nIn fact, the rate of enrollment for older Americans entering college, often part-time or in the evenings, is rising faster\nthan that of traditionally aged students. Students over age 35, accounted for 17% of all college and graduate students\nin 2009, and are expected to comprise 19% of that total by 2020 (Holland, 2014). In some cases, older students are\ndeveloping skills and expertise in order to launch a second career, or to take their career in a new direction. Whether\nthey enroll in school to sharpen particular skills, to retool and reenter the workplace, or to pursue interests that\nhave previously been neglected, older students tend to approach the learning process differently than younger college\nstudents (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 1998).\nThe mechanics of cognition, such as working memory and speed of processing, gradually decline with age. However,\nthey can be easily compensated for through the use of higher order cognitive skills, such as forming strategies to\nenhance memory or summarizing and comparing ideas rather than relying on rote memorization (Lachman, 2004).\nAlthough older students may take a bit longer to learn material, they are less likely to forget it as quickly. Adult\nlearners tend to look for relevance and meaning when learning information. Older adults have the hardest time learning\nMiddle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality | 349 material that is meaningless or unfamiliar. They are more likely to ask themselves, \u201cWhy is this important?\u201d when being\nintroduced to information or when trying to memorize concepts or facts.\nOlder adults are more task-oriented learners and want to organize their activity around problem-solving or making\ncontributions to real world issues. Rubin et al. (2018) surveyed university students aged 17-70 regarding their satisfaction\nand approach to learning in college. Results indicated that older students were more independent, inquisitive, and\nintrinsically motivated compared to younger students. Additionally, older women processed information at a deeper\nlearning level and expressed more satisfaction with their education. Just as at younger ages, during middle adulthood,\nmore women than men are likely to attend and graduate from college.\nTo address the educational needs of those over 50, The American Association of Community Colleges (2016) developed\nthe Plus 50 Initiative that assists community colleges in creating or expanding programs that focus on workforce training\nand new careers for the plus-50 population. Since 2008 the program has provided grants for programs in 138 community\ncolleges affecting over 37, 000 students. The participating colleges offer workforce training programs that prepare 50\nplus adults for careers such as early childhood educators, certified nursing assistants, substance abuse counselors, adult\nbasic education instructors, and human resources specialists. These training programs are especially beneficial because\n80% of people over the age of 50 say they will retire later in life than their parents or continue to work in retirement,\nincluding work in a new field.\nCreativity\nErikson defined the developmental task of generativity as one that included creativity. But what is creativity? Better yet,\nwhat do you think creativity is? Perhaps take a second and reflect on cultural monuments, architecture, artworks, music,\ntheatre, and literature. Take the Mona Lisa and then compare it to the Starry Night, in the figure below. Is one of these\nmore creative than the other? If so, what makes one piece more creative than the other?\nFigure 9.4\nThere are many definitions of creativity, both scientific and non-scientific. Franken (2001) defines creativity as \u201cthe\ntendency to generate or recognize ideas, alternatives, or possibilities that may be useful in solving problems\u2026 and\n350 | Middle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality entertaining ourselves and others.\u201d Does this definition change your answer to the question posed in the previous\nparagraph?\nPsychologists who study creativity largely agree on three components. First, creativity involves a great deal of divergent\nthinking, that is, the ability to look at things from different perspectives. Secondly, creativity involves a unique perspective\nor some element of originality. Finally, creativity must have functionality in that a creative work serves some function\nor some value. While paintings such as the Mona Lisa and Starry Night both display various degrees of originality and\ndivergent thinking, their functionality may not be as transparent as other creative works, such as unique architectural\ndesigns.\nAside from the elements of creativity, researchers are also interested in the creative process. There are four steps\nto this process that are generally agreed upon. First is the period of preparation, that is, the conscious and effortful\npractice of studying and gathering information on a creative endeavor. A second step is the incubation period; a largely\nunconscious process whereby the mind makes new connections and processes knowledge \u2018behind the scenes.\u2019 A third\nstep is illumination, or the \u2018Aha!\u2019 moment, that is, an insight generated from conscious and unconscious processes.\nFinally, revision refers to the part of the processes whereby a creative work is revisited before it is finalized in order to\nensure it accomplishes its original goals.\nDevelopmental scientists have found common trajectories in the development of creativity. Generally, we see creativity\nincrease into the 30\u2019s and middle adulthood, as we are developing expertise, motivation, and cognition. This is not to\nsay that creative output follows the same patterns across all fields of work and study. In mathematics heavy disciplines,\nfor example, creativity generally peaks soon after formal training and at a very young age. This makes sense when we\nconsider the early decreases in working memory capacity and processing speed, which are two elements of math heavy\nwork such as physics and engineering.\nDevelopmental trajectories in creativity in mathematics are opposite to those in fields such as the humanities, social\nsciences, and the arts, where we find that creativity often peaks later in life, as more life experience and knowledge\naccumulate. Nevertheless, typical trajectories for the development of creativity are just that \u2013 average experiences. This\nis not to say that there are not exceptions to these rules. For example, engineers such as Elon Musk make some of their\nmost creative contributions later in life, whereas social scientists, such as Jean Piaget, made contributions to their fields\nat exceedingly early ages. As with most areas of development, the study of creativity is not without its mysteries and\nthere is much room for theoretical development and empirical study.\nWork and Careers in Middle Adulthood\nExpertise refers to specialized skills and knowledge that pertain to a particular topic or activity. In contrast, a novice is\nsomeone who has limited experiences with a particular task. Everyone develops some level of \u201cselective\u201d expertise in\nvocational activities or other areas that are personally meaningful to them, such as making bread, quilting, gardening,\ncomputer programming, or caring for children. Expert thought is often characterized as intuitive, automatic, strategic,\nand flexible.\n\u2022 Intuitive. Novices follow particular steps and rules when problem solving, whereas experts can call upon a vast\namount of knowledge and past experience. As a result, their actions appear more intuitive than formulaic. Novice\ncooks may slavishly follow the recipe step by step, while chefs may glance at recipes for ideas and then follow their\nown procedure.\n\u2022 Automatic. Complex thoughts and actions become more routine for experts. Their reactions appear instinctive\nover time, and this is because expertise allows us to process information faster and more holistically and\nMiddle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality | 351 effectively (Crawford & Channon, 2002).\n\u2022 Strategic. Experts have more effective strategies than non-experts. For instance, while both skilled and novice\ndoctors generate several hypotheses within minutes of an encounter with a patient, the more skilled clinicians\u2019\nconclusions are likely to be more accurate. In other words, they generate better hypotheses than the novice. This\nis because they are able to discount misleading symptoms and other distractors and hone in on the most likely\nproblem the patient is experiencing (Norman, 2005). Consider how your note taking skills may have changed after\nbeing in school over a number of years. Chances are you do not write down everything the instructor says, but\ninstead extract and note the most central ideas. You may have even come up with your own short forms for\ncommonly mentioned words in a course, allowing you to take down notes faster and more efficiently than\nsomeone who may be a novice academic note taker.\n\u2022 Flexible. Experts in all fields are more curious and creative. They enjoy a challenge and experiment with new ideas\nor procedures. The only way for experts to grow in their knowledge is to take on more challenging, rather than\nroutine tasks.\nGaining Expertise. Developing expertise takes time. It is a long process, resulting from repeated experience and\nprotracted practice (Ericsson, Feltovich, & Prietula, 2006). When they are faced with a problem, middle-aged adults\noften find that, with their store of knowledge and experience, they have encountered something similar before. This\nallows them to ignore the irrelevant and focus on the important aspects of the issue. The development of expertise is\none reason why many people often reach the top of their career in middle adulthood.\nHowever, expertise cannot fully make-up for all losses in general cognitive functioning as we age. The superior\nperformance of older adults in comparison to younger novices appears to be task specific (Charness & Krampe, 2006).\nAs we age, we also need to be more deliberate in our practice of skills in order to maintain them. Charness and Krampe\n(2006) in their review of the literature on aging and expertise, also note that the rate of return for our effort diminishes\nas we age. In other words, increasing practice does not recoup the same advances in older adults as similar efforts do at\nyounger ages.\nClimate in the Workplace for Middle-aged Adults. A number of studies have found that job satisfaction tends to peak in\nmiddle adulthood (Besen, Matz-Costa, Brown, Smyer, & Pitt-Catsouphers, 2013; Easterlin, 2006). This satisfaction stems\nnot only from higher wages, but also often from greater involvement in decisions that affect the workplace as middle\naged adults move up from worker to supervisor or manager. Job satisfaction is also influenced by being able to do the job\nwell, and after years of experience at a job many people are more effective and productive. Another reason for this peak\nin job satisfaction is that at midlife many adults lower their expectations and goals (Tangri, Thomas, & Mednick, 2003).\nMiddle-aged employees may realize that they have arrived at the highest level they are likely to reach in their career.\nThis satisfaction at work translates into lower absenteeism, greater productivity, and less job hopping in comparison to\nyounger adults (Easterlin, 2006).\nHowever, not all middle-aged adults are happy in the workplace. Women may find themselves bumping up against the\nglass ceiling. This may explain why females employed at large corporations are twice as likely to quit their jobs as\nare men (Barreto, Ryan, & Schmitt, 2009). Another problem older workers may encounter is job burnout, defined as\nunsuccessfully managed workplace stress (World Health Organization, 2019). Burnout consists of:\n\u2022 Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion\n\u2022 Increased mental distance from one\u2019s job, or feelings of job negativism or cynicism\n\u2022 Reduced feelings of professional effectiveness or efficacy\nAmerican workers may experience burnout more often than workers in many other developed nations, because most\n352 | Middle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality developed nations guarantee by law a set number of paid vacation days (International Labour Organization, ILO, 2011),\nwhereas the United States does not (U.S. Department of Labor, 2016).\nIn addition, in comparision to workers in many other\ndeveloped nations, American workers work more hours\nper year (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, OECD, 2016). Not all employees in the US\nare covered under overtime pay laws (U.S. Department of\nLabor, 2016). This is important when you considered that\nthe 40-hour work week is a myth for most Americans.\nOnly 4 in 10 U.S. workers work the typical 40-hour work\nweek. The average work week for many is almost a full day\nlonger (47 hours), with 39% working 50 or more hours per\nweek (Saad, 2014). As can be seen in Figure 9.5, Americans\nwork more hours than most European nations, especially\nwestern and northern Europe, although they work fewer Figure 9.5 Average Annual Hours Actually Worked per Worker\nhours than workers in other nations, especially Mexico.\nChallenges in the Workplace for Middle-aged Adults. In recent years middle aged adults have been challenged by\neconomic downturns, starting in 2001, and again in 2008 and 2020. During the recession of 2008, fifty-five percent of\nadults reported some problems in the workplace, such as fewer hours, pay-cuts, having to switch to part-time, etc. (Pew\nResearch Center, 2010a). While young adults took the biggest hit in terms of levels of unemployment, middle-aged adults\nalso saw their overall financial resources suffer as their retirement nest eggs disappeared and house values shrank,\nwhile foreclosures increased (Pew Research Center, 2010b). Not surprisingly, this age group, especially those age 50-64,\nreported that the recession hit them worse than did other age groups.\nMiddle-aged adults who find themselves unemployed are likely to remain so longer than those in early adulthood (U.S.\nGovernment Accountability Office, 2012). Agism is a common complaint in the workplace. For example, in the eyes of\nemployers, it may seem more cost effective to hire a young adult, despite their limited experience, as they would be\nstarting out at lower levels on the pay scale. In addition, hiring someone who is 25 and has many years of work ahead of\nthem versus someone who is 55 and will likely retire in 10 years may also be part of the decision to hire a younger worker\n(Lachman, 2004). It may surprise employers to learn that older workers typically stay on the job longer, as younger\nworkers are more geographically mobile and more likely to switch jobs as more attractive opportunities appear. Older\nadults also demonstrate lower rates of absenteeism and greater investment in their work. American workers are also\ncompeting with global markets and changes in technology. Those who are able to keep up with all these changes or are\nwilling to uproot and move around the country or even the world have a better chance of finding work. The decision to\nmove may be easier for people who are younger and have fewer obligations to others.\nMiddle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality | 353 Personality\nIf you remember from our study of infancy, temperament is defined as the innate\ncharacteristics of the infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity,\nnoticeable soon after birth. Does one\u2019s temperament remain stable through the\nlifespan? Do shy and inhibited babies grow up to be shy adults, while the sociable\nchild continues to be the life of the party? Like most developmental research the\nanswer is more complicated than a simple yes or no. Chess and Thomas (1987),\nwho identified children as easy, difficult, or slow-to-warm-up, found that children\nidentified as easy grew up to became well-adjusted adults, while those who\nexhibited a difficult temperament were not as well-adjusted as adults.\nKagan (2002) studied the temperamental category of \u201cinhibition to the unfamiliar\u201d\nin young children. Inhibited infants exposed to unfamiliarity reacted strongly to\nthe stimuli and cried loudly, pumped their limbs, and had an increased heart rate.\nResearch has indicated that these highly reactive children show temperamental\nstability into early childhood, and Bohlin and Hagekull (2009) found that shyness\nin infancy was linked to social anxiety in adulthood. An important aspect of the\nresearch on inhibition was looking at the response of the amygdala, which is\nFigure 9.6 important for fear and anxiety, especially when confronted with possible\nthreatening events in the environment. Using functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (FMRIs) young adults identified as strongly inhibited when they were toddlers showed heightened activation of\nthe amygdala when compared to those identified as uninhibited when toddlers (Davidson & Begley, 2012).\nThis research does seem to indicate that temperamental stability holds for many individuals through the lifespan,\nyet we know that one\u2019s environment can also have a significant impact. Recall from our discussion on\nepigenesis that environmental factors modify gene expression by switching genes on and off. Many cultural and\nenvironmental factors can affect one\u2019s temperament, including exposure to teratogens in utero, early exposure to\nharsh parenting, adversity, or child abuse, supportive child-rearing, stable homes, illnesses, socioeconomic status,\netc. Additionally, individuals often choose environments that align with their temperaments, which in turn further\nstrengthens them (Cain, 2012). Individuals are also active in other ways. As they get older, adults can choose how they\nwish to express their temperaments, deciding for example, that they will not let an inhibited temperament stop them\nfrom experiencing adventures, such as travel. In summary, because temperament is neurophysiological, biology appears\nto be a main reason why temperament remains stable into adulthood. In contrast, the environment appears mainly\nresponsible for changes or modifications in temperament (Clark & Watson, 1999).\nEverybody has their own unique personality, that is, their characteristic manner of thinking, feeling, behaving, and\nrelating to others (John, Robins, & Pervin, 2008). Personality traits refer to these characteristic, routine ways of thinking,\nfeeling, and relating to others. Personality integrates one\u2019s temperament with cultural and environmental influences.\nConsequently, there are signs or indicators of these traits in childhood, but they become particularly evident when the\nperson is an adult. Personality traits are integral to each person\u2019s sense of self, as they involve what people value, how\nthey think and feel about things, what they like to do, and, basically, what they are like most every day throughout much\nof their lives.\n354 | Middle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality Table 9.1 Descriptions of the Big Five Personality Traits\nDimension Description Examples of behaviors predicted by the trait\nIndividuals who are highly open to experience tend to have\nA general appreciation for art, emotion,\nOpenness to distinctive and unconventional decorations in their home.\nadventure, unusual ideas, imagination,\nexperience They are also likely to have books on a wide variety of topics,\ncuriosity, and variety of experience.\na diverse music collection, and works of art on display.\nA tendency to show self- discipline, act Individuals who are conscientious have a preference for\nConscientiousness\ndutifully, and aim for achievement. planned rather than spontaneous behavior.\nThe tendency to experience positive\nExtroverts enjoy being with people.

There are hundreds of different personality traits, and all of these traits can be organized into\nthe broad dimensions referred to as the Five-Factor Model (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008). These five broad domains\ninclude: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. (You can use \u201cOCEAN\u201d as a\nmnemonic to remember them.) This applies to traits that you may use to describe yourself.\nDoes personality change throughout adulthood? Previously the answer was no, but contemporary research shows that\nalthough some people\u2019s personalities are relatively stable over time, others are not (Lucas & Donnellan, 2011; Roberts\n& Mroczek, 2008). Longitudinal studies reveal average changes during adulthood in the expression of some traits (e.g.,\nneuroticism and openness decrease with age and conscientiousness increases) and individual differences in these\npatterns due to idiosyncratic life events (e.g., divorce, illness). Longitudinal research also suggests that adult personality\ntraits, such as conscientiousness, predict important life outcomes including job success, health, and longevity (Friedman\net al., 1993; Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007).\nResearch in the Harvard Health Letter (2012) documents correlations between conscientiousness and many positive\nhealth outcomes, such as lower blood pressure, lower rates of diabetes and stroke, fewer joint problems, being less\nlikely to engage in harmful behaviors, and being more likely to stick to healthy behaviors and avoid stressful situations.\nConscientiousness also appears positively related to career choices, friendships, and stability of marriage. Lastly, a\nperson possessing both self-control and organizational skills, both of which are related to conscientiousness, may\nwithstand the effects of aging better and have stronger cognitive skills than one who does not possess these qualities.\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 This Ted Talk discusses how working-class people can organize and own the businesses they work for, making\ndecisions for themselves and enjoying the fruits of their labor.\nMiddle Adulthood: Generativity, Intelligence, Personality | 355 One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This is the longest developmental stage across\nthe lifespan. In this chapter, we will consider the growth in numbers for those in late adulthood, how that number is\nexpected to change in the future, and the consequences this will have for both the United States and the world. We\nwill also examine several theories of human aging, the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that occur with\nthis population, and the vast diversity among those in this developmental stage. Further, ageism and many of the myths\nassociated with those in late adulthood will be explored.\nLate Adulthood in America\nLate adulthood, which includes those aged 65 years and above, is the fastest growing age division of the United States\npopulation (Gatz, Smyer, & DiGilio, 2016). Currently, one in seven Americans is 65 years of age or older. The first of the\nbaby boomers (born from 1946-1964) turned 65 in 2011, and approximately 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. By the\nyear 2050, almost one in four Americans will be over 65, and will be expected to live longer than previous generations.\nAccording to the U. S. Census Bureau (2014b) a person who turned 65 in 2015 can expect to live another 19 years, which\nis 5.5 years longer than someone who turned 65 in 1950. This increasingly aged population has been referred to as the\n\u201cgraying of America\u201d. This \u201cgraying\u201d is already having significant effects on the nation in many areas, including work,\nhealth care, housing, social security, caregiving, and adaptive technologies. Table 10.1 shows the 2012, 2020, and 2030\nprojected percentages of the U.S. population ages 65 and older.\nTable 10.1 Percent of United States Population 65 Years and Older\nPercent of United States Population 2012 2020 2030\n65 Years and Older 13.7% 16.8% 20.3%\n65-69 4.5% 5.4% 5.6%\n70-74 3.2% 4.4% 5.2%\n75-79 2.4% 3.0% 4.1%\n80-84 1.8% 1.9% 2.9%\n85 Years and Older 1.9% 2.0% 2.5%\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French (2019) and compiled from data from An Aging Nation: The older population in the\nUnited States. United States Census Bureau. https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1140.pdf\nThe \u201cGraying\u201d of the World\nEven though the United States is aging, it is still younger than most other developed countries (Ortman, Velkoff, &\nHogan, 2014). Germany, Italy, and Japan all had at least 20% of their population aged 65 and over in 2012, and Japan had\nthe highest percentage of elderly. Additionally, between 2012 and 2050, the proportion aged 65 and over is projected to\nincrease in all developed countries. Japan is projected to continue to have the oldest population in 2030 and 2050. Table\n10.2 shows the percentages of citizens aged 65 and older in select developed countries in 2012 and projected for 2030\nand 2050.\nLate Adulthood | 361 Table 10.2 Percentage of Citizens 65 Years and Older in Six Developed Countries\nPercent of Population 65 and Older 2012 2030 2050\nAmerica 13.7% 20.3% 22%\nJapan 24% 32.2% 40%\nGermany 20% 27.9% 30%\nItaly 20% 25.5% 31%\nCanada 16.5% 25% 26.5%\nRussia 13% 20% 26%\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French (2019) and compiled from data from An Aging Nation: The older population in the\nUnited States. United States Census Bureau. https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1140.pdf\nAccording to the National Institute on Aging (NIA, 2015b), there\nare 524 million people over 65 worldwide. This number is\nexpected to increase from 8% to 16% of the global population\nby 2050. Between 2010 and 2050, the number of older people in\nless developed countries is projected to increase more than\n250%, compared with only a 71% increase in developed\ncountries. Declines in fertility and improvements in longevity\naccount for the percentage increase for those 65 years and\nolder. In more developed countries, fertility fell below the\nreplacement rate of two live births per woman by the 1970s,\ndown from nearly three children per woman around 1950.\nFertility rates also fell in many less developed countries from an\naverage of six children in 1950 to an average of two or three\nFigure 10.1. Age is increasing worldwide children in 2005. In 2006, fertility was at or below the two-child\nreplacement level in 44 less developed countries (NIA, 2015d).\nIn total number, the United States is projected to have a larger older population than the other developed nations, but\na smaller older population compared with China and India, the world\u2019s two most populous nations (Ortman et al., 2014).\nBy 2050, China\u2019s older population is projected to grow larger than the total U.S. population today. As the population\nages, concerns grow about who will provide for those requiring long-term care. In 2000, there were about 10 people\n85 and older for every 100 persons between ages 50 and 64. These midlife adults are the most likely care providers for\ntheir aging parents. The number of old requiring support from their children is expected to more than double by the\nyear 2040 (He, Sengupta, Velkoff, & DeBarros, 2005). These families will certainly need external physical, emotional, and\nfinancial support in meeting this challenge.\nAge Periods during Late Adulthood\nLate adulthood encompasses a long period, from age 60 potentially to age 120\u2013 sixty years! Researchers recognize that\nwithin that time period, from age 60 until death, there are multiple ages or sub-periods, that can be distinguished\nbased on differences in peoples\u2019 typical physical health and mental functioning during those age periods. In this chapter,\nwe will be dividing the stage into four age periods: Young\u2013old (60-74), old-old (75-84), the oldest-old (85-99), and\n362 | Late Adulthood centenarians (100+). These categories are based on the conceptions of aging including, biological, psychological, social,\nand chronological differences. They also reflect the increase in longevity of those living to this latter stage.\nYoung-old (60-74). Generally, this age span includes many\npositive aspects and is considered the \u201cgolden years\u201d of\nadulthood. When compared to those who are older, the young-\nold experience relatively good health and social engagement\n(Smith, 2000), knowledge and expertise (Singer, Verhaeghen,\nGhisletta, Lindenberger, & Baltes, 2003), and adaptive flexibility\nin daily living (Riediger, Freund, & Baltes, 2005). The young-old\nalso show strong performance in attention, memory, and\ncrystallized intelligence. In fact, those identified as young-old\nare more similar to those in midlife. This group is less likely to\nrequire long-term care, to be dependent or poor, and more\nlikely to be married, working for pleasure rather than income,\nand living independently. Overall, those in this age period feel a\nsense of happiness and emotional well-being that is better than\nat any other period of adulthood (Carstensen, Fung, & Charles,\n2003; George, 2009; Robins & Trzesniewski, 2005). It is also an\nFigure 10.2. Young-old experience positive well-being unusual age in that people are considered both in old age and\nnot in old age (Rubinstein, 2002).\nOld-old (75-84). Adults in this age period are likely to be living independently, but often experience physical impairments\nsince chronic diseases increase after age 75. For example, congestive heart failure is 10 times more common in people\n75 and older, than in younger adults (National Library of Medicine, 2019). In fact, half of all cases of heart failure occur\nin people after age 75 (Strait & Lakatta, 2012). In addition, hypertension and cancer rates are also more common after\n75, but because they are linked to lifestyle choices, they typically can be can prevented, lessoned, or managed (Barnes,\n2011b).\nOldest-old (85-99). Among the older adult population. this age group often includes people who have more serious\nchronic ailments. In the U.S., the oldest-old represented 14% of the older adult population in 2015 (He, Goodkind, &\nKowal, 2016). This age group is one of the fastest growing worldwide and is projected to increase more than 300% over\nits current levels (NIA, 2015b). It is projected that there will be nearly 18 million in oldest-old age group by 2050, or about\n4.5% of the U. S. population, compared with less than 2% of the population today. Females comprise more than 60% of\nthose 85 and older, but they also suffer from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than older males (Gatz et al., 2016).\nWhile this age group accounts for only 2% of the U. S. population, it accounts for 9% of all hospitalizations (Levant,\nChari & DeFrances, 2015). In a study of over 64,000 patients age 65 and older who visited an emergency department,\nthe admission rates increased with age. Thirty-five percent of admissions after an emergency room visit were the\nyoung old, almost 43% were the old-old, and nearly half were the oldest-old (Lee, Oh, Park, Choi, & Wee, 2018). The\nmost common reasons for hospitalization for the oldest-old were congestive heart failure, pneumonia, urinary tract\ninfections, septicemia, stroke, and hip fractures. In recent years, hospitalizations for many of these medical problems\nhave been reduced. However, hospitalization for urinary tract infections and septicemia has increased for those 85 and\nolder Levant et al., 2015). The mortality rate was also higher with age.\nThose 85 and older are more likely to require long-term care and to be in nursing homes than the youngest-old. Almost\n50% of the oldest-old require some assistance with daily living activities (APA, 2016). However, most still live in the\ncommunity rather than a nursing home (Stepler, 2016b). The oldest-old are less likely to be married and living with a\nspouse compared with the majority of the young-old (APA, 2016; Stepler, 2016c). Gender is also an important factor in\nthe likelihood of being married or living with one\u2019s spouse.\nLate Adulthood | 363 Centenarians (100+). A segment of the oldest-old are centenarians, that is, 100\nor older, and some are also referred to as supercentarians, those 110 and older\n(Wilcox, Wilcox & Ferrucci, 2008). In 2015 there were nearly half a million\ncentenarians worldwide, and it is estimated that this age group will grow to\nalmost 3.7 million by 2050. The U. S. has the most centenarians, but Japan and\nItaly have the most per capita (Stepler, 2016e). Most centenarians tended to be\nhealthier than many of their peers as they were growing older, and often there\nwas a delay in the onset of any serious disease or disability until their 90s.\nAdditionally, 25% reached 100 with no serious chronic illnesses, such as\ndepression, osteoporosis, heart disease, respiratory illness, or dementia (Ash et\nal. 2015). Centenarians are more likely to experience a rapid terminal decline in\nlater life, meaning that for most of their adulthood, and even older adult years,\nthey are relatively healthy in comparison to many other older adults (Ash et al.,\n2015; Wilcox et al., 2008). According to Guinness World Records (2016), Jeanne\nLouise Calment has been documented to be the longest living person at 122\nyears and 164 days old (See Figure 10.2).\nFigure 10.2. Jeanne Louise Calment from\nFrance\nPsychosocial Development during Late Adulthood\nDevelopmental Task of Late Adulthood: Integrity vs. Despair\nErikson framed the last part of the lifespan with the developmental task of Integrity versus Despair. In terms of\npsychosocial development, the tasks of adulthood were about becoming the self that you want to become (i.e., Identity)\nand creating the life you want to live, including establishing or maintaining the close interpersonal relationships that\nwill be crucial to your physical and psychological health and well -being (i.e., Intimacy). The value of that life project is\nnegotiated during middle adulthood in the search for meaning and a purpose larger than yourself that will contribute\nto your legacy (i.e., Generativity). So in old age, this final task basically comes down to whether you have built a life and\nconstructed a self that is sufficient to withstand the disintegration of your physical body, the death of many of those you\nlove, and eventually and inevitably, strong enough to face your own impending death with dignity and grace.\nLike all psychosocial tasks, this one has two potential resolutions: Integrity, or a sense of self-acceptance, contentment\nwith life and imminent death versus Despair, or a lack of fulfillment or peace and the inability to come to terms with\nlife, aging, and approaching death. Development during elderhood, as during all developmental periods, is a bio-psycho-\nsocial process that takes place in specific societal and historical contexts. But this task, at the end of life, offers\noffers us the prospect of lifting off of those geographical, societal, and temporal limitations. We have the potential\nto transcend them, to establish a sense of wholeness and acceptance by getting in touch with our universal connection\nto humanity, past, present, and future. Like birth, death is a journey that every single one of us will take.\nErikson\u2019s Ninth Stage of Psychosocial Development\nErikson collaborated with his wife, Joan, throughout much of his work on psychosocial development. In the Eriksons\u2019\nolder years, they re-examined the eight stages and generated additional ideas about how development evolves during\na person\u2019s 80s and 90s. After Erik Erikson passed away in 1994, Joan published a chapter on the ninth stage of\ndevelopment, in which she proposed (from her own experiences and Erikson\u2019s notes) that older adults revisit the previous\neight stages and deal with the previous conflicts in new ways, as they cope with the physical and social changes of growing\nold. In the first eight stages, all of the conflicts are presented in a syntonic-dystonic matter, meaning that the first term\n364 | Late Adulthood listed in the conflict is the positive, sought-after achievement and the second term is the less-desirable goal (i.e., trust\nis more desirable than mistrust and integrity is more desirable than despair) (Perry et al., 2015).\nDuring the ninth stage, the Erikson\u2019s argue that the dystonic, or less desirable outcome, come to take precedence again.\nFor example, an older adult may become mistrustful (trust vs. mistrust), feel more guilt about not having the abilities\nto do what they once did (initiative vs. guilt), feel less competent compared with others (industry vs. inferiority), lose\na sense of identity as they become dependent on others (identity vs. role confusion), become increasingly isolated\n(intimacy vs. isolation), and feel that they have less to offer society (generativity vs. stagnation) (Gusky, 2012). The\nEriksons found that those who successfully come to terms with these changes and adjustments in later life make\nheadway towards gerotranscendence, a term coined by gerontologist Lars Tornstam to represent a greater awareness\nof one\u2019s own life and connection to the universe, increased ties to the past, and a positive, transcendent, perspective about\nlife.\nTheories of Successful Aging\nPsychologists and sociologist have long wondered how people manage to age successfully, and many theories have been\nput developed that highlight the keys to successful aging. We examine five: (1) Activity theory; (2) Continuity theory; (3)\nSocioemotional selectivity theory; (4) Selective optimization with compensation; and (5) Developmental self-regulation\ntheory.\n1. Developed by Havighurst and Albrecht in 1953, activity theory addresses the issue of how persons can best adjust\nto the changing circumstances of old age\u2013e.g., retirement, illness, loss of friends and loved ones through death,\nand so on. In addressing this issue, they recommend that older adults involve themselves in voluntary and\nleisure organizations, child care and other forms of social interaction. Activity theory thus strongly supports the\navoidance of a sedentary lifestyle and considers it essential to health and happiness that the older person remains\nactive physically and socially. In other words, the more active older adults are the more stable and positive their\nself-concept will be, which will then lead to greater life satisfaction and higher morale (Havighurst &\nAlbrecht, 1953). Activity theory suggests that many people are barred from meaningful experiences as they age, but\nolder adults who continue find ways to remain active can work toward replacing lost opportunities with new ones\n(Nilsson et al., 2015).\n2. Continuity theory suggests as people age, they continue to view the self in much the same way as they did\nwhen they were younger. An older person\u2019s approach to problems, goals, and situations is much the same as it was\nwhen they were younger. They are the same individuals, but simply in older bodies. Consequently, older adults\ncontinue to maintain their identity even as they give up previous roles. For example, a retired Coast\nGuard commander attends reunions with shipmates, stays interested in new technology for home use, is\nmeticulous in the jobs he does for friends or at church, and displays mementos from his experiences on the ship.\nHe is able to maintain a sense of self as a result. People do not give up who they are as they age. Hopefully, they are\nable to share these aspects of their identity with others throughout life. Focusing on what a person is still able to\ndo and pursuing those interests and activities is one way to optimize and maintain self-identity.\n3. The Socioemotional Selectivity Theory focuses on changes in motivation for actively seeking social contact with\nothers (Carstensen, 1993; Carstensen, Isaacowitz & Charles, 1999). This theory proposes that with increasing age,\nour motivational goals change based on how much time we have left to live. Rather than focusing on acquiring\ninformation from many diverse social relationships, as adolescents and young adults tend to do, older adults focus\non the emotional aspects of relationships. To optimize the experience of positive affect, older adults actively\nrestrict their social life to prioritize time spent with emotionally close significant others. In line with this theory,\nolder marriages are found to be characterized by enhanced positive and reduced negative interactions and older\nLate Adulthood | 365 partners show more affectionate behavior during conflict discussions than do middle-aged partners (Carstensen,\nGottman, & Levenson, 1995). Research showing that older adults have smaller networks compared to young adults,\nand tend to avoid negative interactions, also supports this theory.\n4. Selective Optimization with Compensation is a strategy for improving health and well being in older adults and a\nmodel for successful aging. It is recommended that seniors select and optimize their best abilities and most intact\nfunctions while compensating for declines and losses. This means, for example, that a person who can no longer\ndrive, is able to find alternative transportation, or a person who is compensating for having less energy, learns how\nto reorganize the daily routine to avoid over-exertion. Perhaps nurses and other allied health professionals\nworking with this population will begin to focus more on helping patients remain independent by optimizing their\nbest functions and abilities rather than simply treating illnesses. Promoting health and independence are essential\nfor successful aging.\n5. Developmental Self-regulation Theory is a dual-process model that could have been based on St. Augustine\u2019s\nserenity prayer. On the one hand, is primary control, or the strength and courage to take action to change the\nthings that can be changed. This includes a sense of self-efficacy to take action needed to make lifestyle changes or\nundergo treatments that optimize functioning, such as a healthy diet, exercise, medical treatments (like taking\none\u2019s insulin or cataract surgery), or adopting outside aids like a cane or walker. The second process is called\naccommodation, and it involves the grace to accept the things that cannot be changed. This attitude of willing\nacceptance includes understanding, gratitude for times past, and a focus on the positive things that still remain.\nSuch accommodation can be contrasted with furious resentment or depressed resignation to the losses of aging.\nIn fact, some researchers argue that depression in old age is often due, not to the losses of control aging inevitably\nentails, but from an inability to accommodate, that is, to relinquish activities and goals that are no longer feasible.\nGenerativity in Late Adulthood\nPeople in late adulthood continue to be productive in many\nways. These include work, education, volunteering, family life,\nand intimate relationships. Older adults also experience\ngenerativity (recall Erikson\u2019s previous stage of generativity vs.\nstagnation) through voting, forming and helping social\ninstitutions like community centers, churches and schools.\nThinking of the issue of legacy, psychoanalyst Erik Erikson\nwrote \u201cI am what survives me\u201d (Havey, 2015).\nProductivity in Work\nFigure 10.3. 82-year old body builder Ernestine Shepard is\nSome older people continue to be productive in work. quoted with saying. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting old; you\u2019re getting\nready\u201d.\nMandatory retirement is now illegal in the United States.\nHowever, many do choose retirement by age 65. Most people\nleave work by choice, and the primary factors that influence decisions about when to retire are health status, finances,\nand satisfaction at work. Those who do leave by choice adjust to retirement more easily. Chances are, they have\nprepared for a smoother transition by gradually giving more attention to an avocation or interest as they\napproach retirement. And they are more likely to be financially ready to retire. Those who must leave abruptly for health\nreasons or because of layoffs or downsizing have a more difficult time adjusting to their new circumstances. Men,\nespecially, can find unexpected retirement difficult.\nWomen may feel less of an identify loss after retirement because much of their identity may have come from family\n366 | Late Adulthood roles as well. At the same time, however, women tend to have poorer retirement funds accumulated from work and\nif they take their retirement funds in a lump sum (be that from their own or from a deceased husband\u2019s funds), are\nmore at risk of outliving those funds. Because they will on average live longer, women need better financial planning in\nretirement. Sixteen percent of adults over 65 were in the labor force in 2008 (U. S. Census Bureau 2011). Globally, 6.2%\nare in the labor force and this number is expected to reach 10.1 million by 2016. Many adults 65 and older continue to\nwork either full-time or part-time either for income or pleasure or both. In 2003, 39% of full-time workers over 55 were\nwomen over the age of 70; 53% were men over 70. This increase in numbers of older adults is likely to mean that more\nwill continue to part of the workforce in years to come (He, et al., 2005).\nVolunteering: Face-to-face and Virtually\nAbout 40% of older adults are involved in some type of structured, face-to-face, volunteer work. But many older adults,\nabout 60%, engage in a sort of informal type of volunteerism, helping out neighbors or friends rather than working in\nan organization (Berger, 2005). They may help a friend by taking them somewhere or shopping for them, etc. Some do\nparticipate in organized volunteer programs but interestingly enough, those who do tend to work part-time as well.\nThose who retire and do not work are less likely to feel that they have a contribution to make. (It\u2019s as if when one gets\nused to staying at home, one\u2019s confidence to go out into the world diminishes.) And those who have recently retired\nare more likely to volunteer than those over 75 years of age. New opportunities exist for older adults to serve as virtual\nvolunteers by dialoguing online with others from around their world and sharing their support, interests, and expertise.\nAccording to an article from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), virtual volunteerism has increased\nfrom 3,000 participants in 1998 to over 40,000 in 2005. These volunteer opportunities range from helping teens with\ntheir writing to communicating with \u2018neighbors\u2019 in villages in developing countries. Virtual volunteering is available to\nthose who cannot engage in face-to-face interactions and opens up a new world of possibilities and ways to connect,\nmaintain identity, and be productive (Uscher, 2006).\nRelationship with Adult Children\nMany older adults provide financial assistance and/or housing to adult children. at this point in history, there is more\nsupport going from the older parent to the younger adult children than in the other direction (Fingerman & Birditt,\n2011). In addition to providing for their own children, many elders are raising their grandchildren. Consistent with\nsocioemotional selectivity theory, older adults seek, and are helped by, their adult children providing emotional support\n(Lang & Sch\u00fctze, 2002). Lang and Sch\u00fctze, as part of the Berlin Aging Study (BASE), surveyed adult children (mean age\n54) and their aging parents (mean age 84). They found that the adult children of older parents who provided emotional\nsupport, such as showing tenderness toward their parent, cheering the parent up when he or she was sad, tended\nto report greater life satisfaction. In contrast, older adults whose children provided informational support, such as\nproviding advice to the parent, reported less life satisfaction. Lang and Sch\u00fctze found that older adults wanted their\nrelationship with their children to be more emotionally meaningful, but they did not want their children telling them\nwhat to do. Daughters and adult children who were younger, tended to provide such support more than sons and adult\nchildren who were older. Lang and Sch\u00fctze also found that adult children who were more autonomous rather than\nemotionally dependent on their parents, had more emotionally meaningful relationships with their parents, from both\nthe parents\u2019 and adult children\u2019s point of view.\nFriendships\nFriendships are not formed in order to enhance status or careers, and may be based purely on a sense of connection\nor the enjoyment of being together. Most elderly people have at least one close friend. These friends may provide\nemotional as well as physical support. Being able to talk with friends and rely on others is very important during this\nstage of life. Bookwala, Marshall, and Manning (2014) found that the availability of a friend played a significant role in\nprotecting women\u2019s health from the impact of widowhood. Specifically, those who became widowed and had a friend as\na confidante, reported significantly lower somatic depressive symptoms, better self-rated health, and fewer sick days in\nLate Adulthood | 367 bed than those who reported not having a friend as a confidante. In contrast, having a family member as a confidante\ndid not provide health protection for those recently widowed.\nEducation\nTwenty percent of people over 65 have a bachelors or higher degree. And over 7 million people over 65 take\nadult education courses (U. S. Census Bureau, 2011). Enriching experiences of lifelong learning are offered through\ncontinuing education programs on college campuses or programs known as \u201cElderhostels\u201d which allow older adults to\ntravel abroad, live on campus, and study. Academic courses as well as practical skills such as computer classes, foreign\nlanguages, budgeting, and holistic medicines are among the courses offered. Older adults who have higher levels of\neducation are more likely to take continuing education. But offering more educational experiences to a diverse group of\nolder adults, including those who are institutionalized in nursing homes, can enhance elder students\u2019 quality of life.\nReligious Activities\nPeople tend to become more involved in prayer and religious activities as they age. This provides a social network as\nwell as a belief system which can combat the fear of death. Religious activities provide a focus for volunteerism and\nother activities as well. For example, one elderly woman prides herself on knitting prayer shawls that are given to those\nwho are sick. Another serves on the alter guild and is responsible for keeping robes and linens clean and ready for\ncommunion.\nPolitical Activism\nThe elderly are very politically active. They have high rates of voting and engage in letter writing to congress on issues\nthat not only affect them, but on a wide range of domestic and foreign concerns. In the past three presidential elections,\nover 70 percent of people 65 and older showed up at the polls to vote (U. S. Census Bureau, 2011).\nLoneliness or Solitude\nLoneliness is the discrepancy between the social contact a person has and the contacts a person wants (Brehm, Miller,\nPerlman, & Campbell, 2002). It can result from social or emotional isolation. Women tend to experience loneliness due\nto social isolation; men from emotional isolation. Loneliness can be accompanied by a lack of self-worth, impatience,\ndesperation, and depression. Being alone does not always result in loneliness. For some, being alone means solitude.\nSolitude involves gaining self-awareness, taking care of the self, being comfortable alone, and pursuing one\u2019s interests\n(Brehm et al., 2002). In contrast, loneliness is perceived social isolation.\nFor those in late adulthood, loneliness can be especially detrimental. Novotney (2019) reviewed the research on\nloneliness and social isolation and found that loneliness was linked to a 40% increase in the risk for dementia and a\n30% increase in the risk of stroke or coronary heart disease. This was hypothesized to be due to reasons that were\nboth biological (e.g., a rise in stress hormones), psychological (e.g., depression and anxiety), as well as social (e.g., the\nindividual lacks encouragement from others to engage in healthy behaviors). In contrast, older adults who take part in\nsocial clubs and church groups have a lower risk of death. Opportunities to reside in mixed age housing and continuing\nto feel like a productive member of society have also been found to decrease feelings of social isolation, and thus\nloneliness.\nLate Adult Lifestyles\nMarriage. As can be seen in Figure 10.4, the most common living arrangement for older adults in 2017 was marriage\n368 | Late Adulthood (AOA, 2017). This status was more common for older men than for older women, who based on differences in average life\nexpectancy, typically outlive their husbands.\nFigure 10.4. Marital status: Age 65+ in 2017\nDivorce. As noted previously, older adults are divorcing at higher rates than in prior generations. However, adults age\n65 and over are still less likely to divorce than middle-aged and young adults (Wu & Schimmele, 2007). Divorce poses\na number of challenges for older adults, especially women, who are more likely to experience financial difficulties and\nare more likely to remain single than are older men (McDonald & Robb, 2004). However, in both America (Lin, 2008) and\nEngland (Glaser, Stuchbury, Tomassini, & Askham, 2008), studies have found that the adult children of divorcing parents\noffer more support and care to their mothers than their fathers. While divorced, older men may be better off financially\nand are more likely to find another partner, so they may receive less support from their adult children.\nDating. Due to changing social norms and shifting cohort demographics, it has become more common for single older\nadults to be involved in dating and romantic relationships (Alterovitz & Mendelsohn, 2011). An analysis of widows and\nwidowers ages 65 and older found that 18 months after the death of a spouse, 37% of men and 15% of women were\ninterested in dating (Carr, 2004a). Unfortunately, opportunities to develop close relationships often diminish in later life\nas social networks decrease because of retirement, relocation, and the death of friends and loved ones (de Vries, 1996).\nConsequently, older adults, much like those younger, are increasing their social networks using technologies, including\ne-mail, chat rooms, and online dating sites (Fox, 2004; Wright & Query, 2004; Papernow, 2018).\nInterestingly, older men and women parallel online dating information as those younger. Alterovitz and Mendelsohn\n(2011) analyzed 600 internet personal ads from different age groups, and across the life span, men sought physical\nattractiveness and offered status-related information more than women. With advanced age, men desired women\nincreasingly younger than themselves, whereas women desired older men until ages 75 and over, when they sought men\nyounger than themselves. Research has previously shown that older women in romantic relationships are not interested\nin becoming a caregiver or becoming widowed for a second time (Carr, 2004a).\nAdditionally, older men are more eager to repartner than are older women (Davidson, 2001; Erber & Szuchman, 2015).\nConcerns expressed by older women included not wanting to lose their autonomy, care for a potentially ill partner, or\nLate Adulthood | 369 merge their finances with someone (Watson & Stelle, 2011). Older dating adults also need to know about threats to sexual\nhealth, including being at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia, genital herpes, and HIV. Nearly\n25% of people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States are 50 or older (Office on Women\u2019s Health, 2010b). Githens\nand Abramsohn (2010) found that only 25% of adults 50 and over who were single or had a new sexual partner used a\ncondom the last time they had sex. Robin (2010) stated that 40% of those 50 and over have never been tested for HIV.\nThese results indicate that educating all individuals, not just adolescents, on healthy sexual behavior is important.\nRemarriage and Cohabitation. Older adults who remarry often find that their remarriages are more stable than those of\nyounger adults. Kemp and Kemp (2002) suggest that greater emotional maturity may lead to more realistic expectations\nregarding marital relationships, leading to greater stability in remarriages in later life. Older adults are also more likely to\nbe seeking companionship in their romantic relationships. Carr (2004a) found that older adults who have considerable\nemotional support from their friends were less likely to seek romantic relationships. In addition, older adults who\nhave divorced often desire the companionship of intimate relationships without marriage. As a result, cohabitation\nis increasing among older adults, and like remarriage, cohabitation in later adulthood is often associated with more\npositive consequences than it is in younger age groups (King & Scott, 2005). No longer being interested in raising\nchildren, and perhaps wishing to protect family wealth, older adults may see cohabitation as a good alternative to\nmarriage. In 2014, 2% of adults age 65 and up were cohabitating (Stepler, 2016b).\nLiving Apart Together. In addition to cohabiting there has been an increase in living apart together (LAT), which is \u201ca\nmonogamous intimate partnership between unmarried individuals who live in separate homes but identify themselves as a\ncommitted couple\u201d (Benson & Coleman, 2016, p. 797). This trend has been found in several nations and is motivated by:\n\u2022 A strong desire to be independent in day-to-day decisions\n\u2022 Maintaining their own home\n\u2022 Keeping boundaries around established relationships\n\u2022 Maintaining financial stability\nBesides the desire to be autonomous, there is also a need for companionship, sexual intimacy, and emotional support.\nAccording to Bensen and Coleman, there are differences in LAT among older and younger adults. Those who are younger\noften enter into LAT out of circumstances, such as the job market, and they frequently view this arrangement as a\ntransitional stage. In contrast, 80% of older adults reported that they did not wish to cohabitate or marry. For some\nit was a conscious choice to live more independently. For instance, older women desired the LAT lifestyle as a way of\navoiding the traditional gender roles that are often inherent in relationships where couples live together. However, some\nolder adults become LATs because they fear social disapproval from others if they were to live together.\nGay and Lesbian Elders\nApproximately 3 million older adults in the United States identify as lesbian or gay (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). By 2025\nthat number is expected to rise to more than 7 million (National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 2006). Despite the increase\nin numbers, older lesbian and gay adults are one of the least researched demographic groups, and the research there\nis portrays a population faced with discrimination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2011),\ncompared to heterosexuals, lesbian and gay adults experience disparities in both physical and mental health. More than\n40% of lesbian and gay adults ages 50 and over suffer from at least one chronic illness or disability and compared to\nheterosexuals they are more likely to smoke and binge drink (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). Additionally, gay older adults\nhave an increased risk of prostate cancer (Blank, 2005) and infection from HIV and other sexually transmitted illnesses\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008). When compared to heterosexuals, lesbian and gay elders have less\nsupport from others as they are twice as likely to live alone and four times less likely to have adult children (Hillman &\nHinrichsen, 2014).\n370 | Late Adulthood Lesbian and gay older adults who belong to ethnic and cultural minorities, conservative religions, and rural communities\nmay face additional stressors. Ageism, heterocentrism, sexism, and racism can combine cumulatively and impact the\nolder adult beyond the negative impact of each individual form of discrimination (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). David and\nKnight (2008) found that older gay black men reported higher rates of racism than younger gay black men and higher\nlevels of perceived ageism than older gay white men.\nLGBT Elder Care. Approximately 7 million LGBT people over age 50 will reside in the United States by 2030, and\n4.7 million of them will need elder care. Decisions regarding elder care is often left for families, and because many\nLGBT people are estranged from their families and do not have children of their own, they are left in a vulnerable\nposition when seeking living arrangements (Alleccia & Bailey, 2019). A history of discriminatory policies, such as housing\nrestricted to married individuals involving one man and one woman, and stigma associated with LGBT people make\nthem especially vulnerable to negative housing experiences when looking for elder care.\nAlthough lesbian and gay older adults face many challenges,\nmore than 80% indicate that they engage in some form of\nwellness or spiritual activity (Fredrickson-Goldsen et al., 2011).\nThey also gather social support from friends and \u201cfamily\nmembers by choice\u201d rather than legal or biological relatives\n(Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). This broader social network\nprovides extra support to gay and lesbian elders.\nAn important consideration when reviewing the development\nof gay and lesbian older adults is the cohort in which they grew\nup (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). The oldest lesbian and gay\nadults came of age in the 1950\u2019s when there were no laws to\nprotect them from victimization. The baby boomers, who grew Figure 10.5\nup in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, began to see states repeal laws that\ncriminalized homosexual behavior. Future lesbian and gay elders will have different experiences due to the legal right\nfor same-sex marriage and greater societal acceptance. Consequently, just like all those in late adulthood, understanding\nthat gay and lesbian elders are a heterogeneous population is important when understanding their overall development.\nOptional Reading: Work, Retirement and Leisure\nPhysical Development\nPhysical Changes of Aging\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) (NIA, 2011b) began in 1958 and has traced the aging process in\n1,400 people from age 20 to 90. Researchers from the BLSA have found that the aging process varies significantly\nfrom individual to individual and from one organ system to another. However, some key generalization can be made\nincluding:\n\u2022 Heart muscles thicken with age\n\u2022 Arteries become less flexible\nLate Adulthood | 371 \u2022 Lung capacity diminishes\n\u2022 Kidneys become less efficient in removing waste from the blood\n\u2022 Bladder loses its ability to store urine\n\u2022 Brain cells also lose some functioning, but new neurons can also be produced.\nMany of these changes are determined by genetics, lifestyle, and disease. Other changes in late adulthood include:\nBody Changes. Everyone\u2019s body shape changes naturally as they age. According to the National Library of Medicine\n(2014) after age 30 people tend to lose lean tissue, and some of the cells of the muscles, liver, kidney, and other organs\nare lost. Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in the body and bones may lose some of their minerals and become\nless dense (a condition called osteopenia in the early stages and osteoporosis in the later stages). The amount of body\nfat goes up steadily after age 30, and older individuals may have almost one third more fat compared to when they were\nyounger. Fat tissue builds up toward the center of the body, including around the internal organs.\nSkin, Hair and Nails. With age skin loses fat, and becomes thinner, less elastic, and no longer looks plump and smooth.\nVeins and bones can be seen more easily, and scratches, cuts, and bumps can take longer to heal. Years of exposure\nto the sun may lead to wrinkles, dryness, and cancer. Older people may bruise more easily, and it can take longer for\nthese bruises to heal. Some medicines or illnesses may also cause bruising. Gravity can cause skin to sag and wrinkle,\nand smoking can wrinkle skin as well. Also, seen in older adulthood are age spots, previously called \u201cliver spots\u201d. They\nlook like flat, brown spots and are often caused by years in the sun. Skin tags are small, usually flesh-colored growths of\nskin that have a raised surface. They become common as people age, especially for women, but both age spots and skin\ntags are harmless (NIA, 2015f).\nNearly everyone has hair loss as they age, and the rate of hair growth slows down as many hair follicles stop producing\nnew hairs (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2019). The loss of pigment and subsequent graying begun in middle\nadulthood continues during late adulthood. The body and face also lose hair. Facial hair may grow coarser. For women\nthis often occurs around the chin and above the upper lip. For men the hair of the eyebrows, ears, and nose may grow\nlonger. Nails, particularly toenails, may become hard and thick. Lengthwise ridges may develop in the fingernails and\ntoenails. However, pits, lines, changes in shape or color of fingernails should be checked by a healthcare provider as they\ncan be related to nutritional deficiencies or kidney disease (U.S. National Library of Medicine).\nHeight and Weight. The tendency to become shorter as one ages occurs among all races and both sexes. Height loss\nis related to aging changes in the bones, muscles, and joints. A total of 1 to 3 inches in height is lost with aging. People\ntypically lose almost one-half inch every 10 years after age 40, and height loss is even more rapid after age 70. Changes\nin body weight vary for men and woman. Men often gain weight until about age 55, and then begin to lose weight later in\nlife, possibly related to a drop in the male sex hormone testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65, and then\nbegin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue, and fat weighs less\nthan muscle. Diet and exercise are important factors in weight changes in late adulthood (National Library of Medicine,\n2014).\nSarcopenia is the loss of muscle tissue as a natural part of aging. Sarcopenia is most noticeable in men, and physically\ninactive people can lose as much as 3% to 5% of their muscle mass each decade after age 30, but even people who are\nactive still lose muscle (Webmd, 2016). Symptoms include a loss of stamina and weakness, which can decrease physical\nactivity and subsequently shrink muscles further. Sarcopenia typically increases around age 75, but it may also speed\nup as early as 65 or as late as 80. Factors involved in sarcopenia include a reduction in nerve cells responsible for\nsending signals to the muscles from the brain to begin moving, a decrease in the ability to turn protein into energy,\nand not receiving enough calories or protein to sustain adequate muscle mass. Any loss of muscle is important because\nit lessens strength and mobility, and sarcopenia is a factor in frailty and the likelihood of falls and fractures in older\n372 | Late Adulthood adults. Maintaining strong leg and heart muscles are important for independence. Weight-lifting, walking, swimming, or\nengaging in other cardiovascular exercises can help strengthen muscles and prevent atrophy.\nSensory Changes in Late Adulthood\nVision. In late adulthood, all the senses show signs of decline, especially among the oldest-old. In the last chapter, you\nread about the visual changes that were beginning in middle adulthood, such as presbyopia, dry eyes, and problems\nseeing in dimmer light. By later adulthood these changes are much more common. Three serious eyes diseases are also\nmore common in older adults: cataracts, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Only the first can be effectively cured in\nmost people.\nCataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye. The lens of the eye is made up of mostly water and protein. The protein\nis precisely arranged to keep the lens clear, but with age some of the protein starts to clump. As more of the protein\nclumps together the clarity of the lens is reduced. While some adults in middle adulthood may show signs of cloudiness\nin the lens, the area affected is usually small enough not to interfere with vision. More people have problems with\ncataracts after age 60 (NIH, 2014b) and by age 75, 70% of adults will have problems with cataracts (Boyd, 2014). Cataracts\nalso cause a discoloration of the lens, tinting it more yellow and then brown, which can interfere with the ability to\ndistinguish colors such as black, brown, dark blue, or dark purple.\nRisk factors besides age include certain health problems such as diabetes,\nhigh blood pressure, and obesity, behavioral factors such as smoking,\nother environmental factors such as prolonged exposure to ultraviolet\nsunlight, previous trauma to the eye, long-term use of steroid medication,\nand a family history of cataracts (NEI, 2016a; Boyd, 2014). Cataracts are\ntreated by removing and replacing the lens of the eye with a synthetic\nlens. In developed countries, such as the United States, cataracts can be\neasily treated with surgery.\nHowever, in developing countries, access to such operations are limited,\nmaking cataracts the leading cause of blindness in late adulthood in the\nleast developed countries (Resnikoff, Pascolini, Mariotti & Pokharel, 2004).\nAs shown in Figure 10.6, in areas of the world with limited medical\ntreatment for cataracts, people are living more years with a serious\ndisability. For example, of those living in the darkest red color on the map,\nmore than 990 out of 100,00 people have a shortened lifespan due to the\ndisability caused by cataracts.\nOlder adults are also more likely to develop age-related macular\nFigure 10.6 degeneration, which is the loss of clarity in the center field of vision, due to\nthe deterioration of the macula, the center of the retina. Macular\ndegeneration does not usually cause total vision loss, but the loss of the central field of vision can greatly impair day-to-\nday functioning. There are two types of macular degeneration: dry and wet. The dry type is the most common form and\noccurs when tiny pieces of a fatty protein called drusen form beneath the retina. Eventually the macular becomes\nthinner and stops working properly (Boyd, 2016). About 10% of people with macular degeneration have the wet type,\nwhich causes more damage to their central field of vision than the dry form. This form is caused by an abnormal\ndevelopment of blood vessels beneath the retina. These vessels may leak fluid or blood causing more rapid loss of vision\nthan the dry form.\nThe risk factors for macular degeneration include smoking, which doubles your risk (NIH, 2015a); race, as it is more\ncommon among Caucasians than African Americans or Hispanics/Latinos; high cholesterol; and a family history of\nLate Adulthood | 373 macular degeneration (Boyd, 2016). At least 20 different genes have been related to this eye disease, but there is no\nsimple genetic test to determine your risk, despite claims by some genetic testing companies (NIH, 2015a). At present,\nthere is no effective treatment for the dry type of macular degeneration. Some research suggests that some patients\nmay benefit from a cocktail of certain antioxidant vitamins and minerals, but results are mixed at best. They are not a\ncure for the disease nor will they restore the vision that has been lost. This \u201ccocktail\u201d can slow the progression of visual\nloss in some people (Boyd, 2016; NIH, 2015a). For the wet type, medications that slow the growth of abnormal blood\nvessels and surgery, such as laser treatment to destroy the abnormal blood vessels, may be used. Unfortunately, only\n25% of those with the wet version typically see improvement with these procedures (Boyd, 2016).\nA third vision problem that increases with age is glaucoma, which is the loss of peripheral vision, frequently due to a\nbuildup of fluid in eye that damages the optic nerve. As we age the pressure in the eye may increase causing damage\nto the optic nerve. The exterior of the optic nerve receives input from retinal cells on the periphery, and as glaucoma\nprogresses more and more of the peripheral visual field deteriorates toward the central field of vision. In the advanced\nstages of glaucoma, a person can lose their sight entirely. Fortunately, glaucoma tends to progresses slowly (NEI, 2016b).\nFigure 10.7. A normal range of Figure 10.8. View with macular Figure 10.9. View with glaucoma Figure 10.10. View with cataracts\nvision degeneration\nGlaucoma is the most common cause of blindness in the\nU.S. (NEI, 2016b). African Americans over age 40, and everyone else over age 60, have a higher risk for glaucoma. Those\nwith diabetes, and with a family history of glaucoma also have a higher risk (Owsley et al., 2015). There is no cure for\nglaucoma, but its rate of progression can be slowed, especially with early diagnosis. Routine eye exams to measure eye\npressure and examination of the optic nerve can detect both the risk and presence of glaucoma (NEI, 2016b). Those with\nelevated eye pressure are given medicated eye drops. Reducing eye pressure lowers the risk of developing glaucoma or\nslow its progression in those who already have it.\nHearing. As you read previously, our hearing declines both in terms of the frequencies of sound we can detect, and the\nintensity of sound needed to hear as we age. These changes continue in late adulthood. Almost 1 in 4 adults aged 65 to\n74 and 1 in 2 aged 75 and older have disabling hearing loss (NIH, 2016). Table 10.3 lists some common signs of hearing\nloss.\nTable 10.3 Common Signs of Hearing Loss\n*Have trouble hearing over the telephone\n*Find it hard to follow conversations when two or more people are talking\n*Often ask people to repeat what they are saying\n*Need to turn up the TV volume so loud that others complain\n*Have a problem hearing because of background noise\n*Think that others seem to mumble\n*Cannot understand when women and children are speaking\n374 | Late Adulthood adapted from NIA, 2015c\nPresbycusis is a common form of hearing loss in late adulthood that results in a gradual loss of hearing. It runs in families\nand affects hearing in both ears (NIA, 2015c). Older adults may also notice tinnitus, a ringing, hissing, or roaring sound\nin the ears. The exact cause of tinnitus is unknown, although it can be related to hypertension and allergies. It may come\nand go or persist and get worse over time (NIA, 2015c). The incidence of both presbycusis and tinnitus increase with age\nand males around the world have higher rates of both (McCormak, Edmondson-Jones, Somerset, & Hall, 2016).\nYour auditory system has two jobs: To help you to hear, and to help you maintain balance. Your balance is controlled\nwhen the brain receives information from the shifting of hair cells in the inner ear about the position and orientation of\nthe body. With age, the functionality of the inner ear declines, which can lead to problems with balance when sitting,\nstanding, or moving (Martin, 2014).\nTaste and Smell. Our sense of taste and smell are part of our chemical sensing system. Our sense of taste, or gustation,\nappears to age well. Normal taste occurs when molecules that are released by chewing food stimulate taste buds along\nthe tongue, the roof of the mouth, and in the lining of the throat. These cells send messages to the brain, where specific\ntastes are identified. After age 50, we start to lose some of these sensory cells. Most people do not notice any changes in\ntaste until their 60s (NIH: Senior Health, 2016b). Given that the loss of taste buds is very gradual, even in late adulthood,\nmany people are often surprised that their loss of taste is most likely the result of a loss of smell.\nOur sense of smell, or olfaction, decreases with age, and problems with the sense of smell are more common in men\nthan in women. Almost 1 in 4 males in their 60s have a disorder with the sense of smell, compared to 1 in 10 women (NIH:\nSenior Health, 2016b). This loss of smell due to aging is called presbyosmia. Olfactory cells are located in a small area high\nin the nasal cavity. These cells are stimulated via two pathways: when we inhale through the nose, or via the connection\nbetween the nose and the throat when we chew and digest food. It is a problem with this second pathway that explains\nwhy some foods such as chocolate or coffee seem tasteless when we have a head cold. There are several types of loss of\nsmell. Total loss of smell, or anosmia, is extremely rare.\nProblems with our chemical senses can be linked to other serious medical conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s,\nor multiple sclerosis (NIH: Senior Health, 2016a). Any sudden changes in sensory sensitivity should be checked out. Loss\nof smell can change a person\u2019s diet, with either a loss of enjoyment of food and eating too little for balanced nutrition,\nor adding sugar and salt to foods that are becoming blander to the palette.\nTable 10.4 Types of Smell Disorders\nPresbyosmia Smell loss due to aging\nHyposmia Loss of only certain odors\nAnosmia Total loss of smell\nChange in the perception of odors.\nDysosmia\nFamiliar odors are distorted\nPhantosmia Smell odors that are not present\nadapted from NIH Senior Health: Problems with Smell\nTouch. Research has found that with age, people may experience reduced or changed sensations of vibration, cold,\nheat, pressure, and pain (Martin, 2014). Many of these changes are also consistent with a number of medical conditions\nthat are more common among the elderly, such as diabetes. However, there are also changes in touch sensations\namong healthy older adults. The ability to detect changes in pressure have been shown to decline with age, with more\nLate Adulthood | 375 pronounced losses during the 6th decade and diminishing further with advanced age (Bowden & McNelty, 2013). Yet,\nthere is considerable variability, with almost 40% of the elderly showing sensitivity that is comparable to younger adults\n(Thornbury & Mistretta, 1981). However, the ability to detect the roughness/ smoothness or hardness/softness of an\nobject shows no appreciable change with age (Bowden & McNulty, 2013). Those who show decreasing sensitivity to\npressure, temperature, or pain are at risk for injury (Martin, 2014), as they can injure themselves without detecting it.\nPain. According to Molton and Terrill (2014), approximately 60%-75% of people over the age of 65 report at least some\nchronic pain, and this rate is even higher for those individuals living in nursing homes. Although the presence of pain\nincreases with age, older adults are less sensitive to pain than younger adults (Harkins, Price, & Martinelli, 1986). Farrell\n(2012) looked at research studies that included neuroimaging techniques involving older people who were healthy and\nthose who experienced a painful disorder. Results indicated that there were age-related decreases in brain volume\nin those structures involved in pain. Especially noteworthy were changes in the prefrontal cortex, brainstem, and\nhippocampus.\nWomen are more likely to report feeling pain than men (Tsang et al., 2008). Women have fewer opioid receptors in the\nbrain, and women also receive less relief from opiate drugs (Garrett, 2015). Because pain serves an important indicator\nthat there is something wrong, a decreased sensitivity to pain in older adults is a concern because it can conceal\nillnesses or injuries requiring medical attention.\nChronic health problems, including arthritis, cancer, diabetes, joint pain, sciatica, and shingles are responsible for most\nof the pain felt by older adults (Molton & Terrill, 2014). Cancer is a special concern, especially \u201cbreakthrough pain\u201d which\nis a severe pain that comes on quickly while a patient is already medicated with a long-acting painkiller. It can be very\nupsetting, and after one attack many people worry it will happen again. Some older individuals worry about developing\nan addiction to pain medication, but if medicine is taken exactly as prescribed, addiction should not be a concern (NIH,\n2015b). Lastly, side effects from pain medicine, including constipation, dry mouth, and drowsiness, may occur that can\nadversely affect the elder\u2019s life.\nSome older individuals put off going to the doctor because they think pain is just part of aging and nothing can\nhelp. Of course, this is not usually true. Managing pain is crucial to ensure feelings of well-being for the older adult.\nWhen chronic pain is not managed, the individual tends to restrict their movements for fear of feeling pain or injuring\nthemselves further. This lack of activity will result in more restriction, further decreased participation, and greater\ndisability (Jensen, Moore, Bockow, Ehde, & Engel, 2011). A decline in physical activity because of pain is also associated\nwith weight gain and obesity in adults (Strine, Hootman, Chapman, Okoro, & Balluz, 2005). Additionally, sleep and mood\ndisorders, such as depression, can occur (Moton & Terrill, 2014). Learning to cope effectively with pain is an important\nconsideration in late adulthood and working with one\u2019s primary physician or a pain specialist is recommended (NIH,\n2015b).\nOf those 65 and older, 35% have a disability. Figure 10.11 identifies the percentage of those who have a disability based\non the type.\n376 | Late Adulthood Figure 10.11 Percentage of adults 65 and older with a disability in 2017\nBrain Functioning\nResearch has demonstrated that the brain loses 5% to 10% of its weight between 20 and 90 years of age (Fjell &\nWalhovd, 2010). This decrease in brain volume appears to be due to the shrinkage of neurons, decreases in the number\nof synapses, and increasingly shorter axon lengths. According to Garrett (2015), normal declines in cognitive ability\nthroughout the lifespan are associated with brain changes, including reduced activity of genes involved in memory\nstorage, synaptic pruning, plasticity, and glutamate and GABA (neurotransmitters) receptors.\nThere is also a loss in white matter connections between brain areas. Without myelin, neurons demonstrate slower\nconduction and impede each other\u2019s actions. A loss of synapses occurs in specific brain areas, including the\nhippocampus (involved in memory) and the basal forebrain region. Older individuals also activate larger regions of their\nattentional and executive networks, located in the parietal and prefrontal cortex, when they perform complex tasks.\nThis increased activation coincides with reduced performance on both executive tasks and tests of working memory\nwhen compared to that of younger people (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).\nContinued Neurogenesis. Researchers at the University of Chicago found that new neurons continue to form into old\nage. Tobin et al. (2019) examined post-mortem brain tissue of individuals between the ages of 79 and 99 (average age\n90.6) and found evidence of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Approximately 2000 neural progenitor cells and 150,\n000 developing neurons were found per brain, although the number of developing neurons was lower in people with\ncognitive impairments or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Tobin et al. hypothesized that the lower levels of neurogenesis in the\nhippocampus were associated with symptoms of cognitive decline and reduced synaptic plasticity.\nThe brain in late adulthood also exhibits considerable plasticity, and through practice and training, the brain can\nbe modified to compensate for any age-related changes (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Park and Reuter-Lorenz (2009)\nproposed the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition which states that the brain adapts to neural atrophy (dying of\nbrain cells) by building alternative connections, referred to as scaffolding. This scaffolding allows older brains to retain\nhigh levels of performance. Brain compensation is especially noted in the additional neural effort demonstrated by those\nindividuals who are aging well. For example, older adults who performed just as well as younger adults on a memory task\nLate Adulthood | 377 used both prefrontal areas, while only the right prefrontal cortex was used in younger participants (Cabeza, Anderson,\nLocantore, & McIntosh, 2002). Consequently, this decrease in brain lateralization appears to assist older adults with their\ncognitive skills.\nHealthy Brain Functioning. In longitudinal studies, Cheng\n(2016) found that both physical activity and stimulating\ncognitive activity resulted in significant reductions in the risk of\nneurocognitive disorders. Physical activity, especially aerobic\nexercise, is associated with less age-related gray and white\nmatter loss, as well and diminished neurotoxins in the bra\nOverall, physical activity preserves the integrity of neurons and\nbrain volume. Cognitive training improves the efficiency of the\nprefrontal cortex and executive functions, such as working\nmemory, and strengthens the plasticity of neural circuits. Both\nactivities support cognitive reserve, or \u201cthe structural and\ndynamic capacities of the brain that buffer against atrophies and\nlesions\u201d (Cheng, 2016, p. 85). Although it is optimal to begin\nphysical and cognitive activities earlier in life, it is never too late\nto start these programs to improve one\u2019s cognitive health, even\nin late adulthood.\nFigure 10.12 Exercise is important to brain functioning\nCan we improve brain functioning? Many training programs have been created to improve brain functioning. ACTIVE\n(Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly), a study conducted between 1999 and 2001 in which\n2,802 individuals age 65 to 94, suggests that the answer is \u201cyes\u201d. These racially diverse participants received 10 group\ntraining sessions and 4 follow up sessions to work on tasks of memory, reasoning, and speed of processing. These mental\nworkouts improved cognitive functioning even 5 years later. Many of the participants believed that this improvement\ncould be seen in everyday tasks as well (Tennstedt et al., 2006).\nHowever, programs for the elderly on memory, reading, and processing speed training demonstrate that there is\nimprovement on the specific tasks trained, but there is no generalization to other abilities (Jarrett, 2015). Further, these\nprograms have not been shown to delay or slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Although these programs are\nnot harmful, \u201cphysical exercise, learning new skills, and socializing remain the most effective ways to train your brain\u201d\n(p. 207). These activities appear to build a reserve to minimize the effects of primary aging of the brain.\nWomen and Aging\nIn Western society, aging for women is much more stressful than for men as society emphasizes youthful beauty and\nattractiveness (Slevin, 2010). The description that aging men are viewed as \u201cdistinguished\u201d and aging women are viewed\nas \u201cold\u201d is referred to as the double standard of aging (Teuscher & Teuscher, 2006). Since women have traditionally\nbeen valued for their reproductive capabilities, they may be considered old once they are postmenopausal. In contrast,\nmen have traditionally been valued for their achievements, competence, and power, and therefore are not considered\nold until decades later when they are physically unable to work (Carroll, 2016). Consequently, women experience more\nfear, anxiety, and concern about their identity as they age, and may feel pressure to prove themselves as productive and\nvaluable members of society (Bromberger, Kravitz, & Chang, 2013).\nAttitudes about aging, however, do vary by race, culture, and sexual orientation. In some cultures, aging women gain\ngreater social status. For example, as Asian women age they attain greater respect and have greater authority in the\nhousehold (Fung, 2013). Compared to white women, Black and Latina women possess fewer stereotypes about aging\n(Schuler et al., 2008). Lesbians are also more positive about aging and looking older than heterosexual women (Slevin,\n378 | Late Adulthood 2010). The impact of media certainly plays a role in how women view aging by selling anti-aging products and supporting\ncosmetic surgeries to look younger (Gilleard & Higgs, 2000).\nOptional Reading: Chronic Conditions\nCognition, Wisdom, and Spirituality\nHow Does Aging Affect Information Processing?\nThere are many stereotypes regarding older adults\u2013 as forgetful and confused, but what does the research on memory\nand cognition in late adulthood reveal? Memory comes in many types, such as working, episodic, semantic, implicit, and\nprospective. There are also many processes involved in memory. Thus it should not be a surprise that there are declines\nin some types of memory and memory processes, while other areas of memory are maintained or even show some\nimprovement with age. In this section, we will focus on changes in memory, attention, problem solving, intelligence,\npost-formal cognition, and wisdom, including the effects of stereotypes that exaggerate these losses in the elderly.\nMemory\nChanges in Working Memory. Working memory is the more active, effortful part of our memory system. Working\nmemory is composed of three major systems: The phonological loop that maintains information about auditory stimuli,\nthe visuospatial sketchpad, that maintains information about visual stimuli, and the central executive, that oversees\nworking memory, allocating resources where needed and monitoring whether cognitive strategies are being effective\n(Schwartz, 2011).\nSchwartz reports that it is the central executive that typically shows the most marked declines with age. In tasks that\nrequire allocation of attention between different stimuli, older adults fare worse than do younger adults. In a study\nby G\u00f6the, Oberauer, and Kliegl (2007) older and younger adults were asked to learn two tasks simultaneously. Young\nadults eventually managed to learn and perform both tasks without any loss in speed and efficiency, although it did\ntake considerable practice. None of the older adults were able to accomplish this. Yet, when asked to learn each task\nindividually, older adults could perform just as well as young adults. Having older adults learn and perform both tasks\ntogether was just too taxing for the central executive. In contrast, in working memory tasks that do not require much\ninput from the central executive, such as the digit span test, which predominantly uses the phonological loop, older\nadults perform on par with young adults (Dixon & Cohen, 2003).\nChanges in Long-term Memory. Long-term memory is divided into semantic (knowledge of facts), episodic (memories\nof specific events), and implicit (stored procedural skills, classical conditioning, and priming) memory. Semantic and\nepisodic memory are part of the explicit memory system, which requires conscious effort to create and retrieve. Several\nstudies consistently reveal that episodic memory shows greater age-related declines than semantic memory (Schwartz,\n2011; Spaniol, Madden, & Voss, 2006).\nIt has been suggested that episodic memories may be harder to encode and retrieve because they contain at least two\ndifferent types of memory (1) the event and (2) when and where the event took place. In contrast, semantic memories are\nnot tied to any particular geography or time line. Thus, only the knowledge needs to be encoded or retrieved (Schwartz,\n2011). Spaniol et al. (2006) found that retrieval of semantic information was considerably faster for both younger and\nLate Adulthood | 379 older adults than the retrieval of episodic information, with there being little difference between the two age groups\nfor retrieval of semantic memories. They note that older adults\u2019 poorer performance on episodic memory appeared\nto be related to slower processing of the information and the difficulty of the task. They found that as tasks became\nmore difficult, the gap between the two age groups\u2019 performance widened, but more so for tasks involving episodic than\nsemantic memory tasks.\nStudies that examine general knowledge (semantic memory) of topics such as politics and history (Dixon, Rust, Feltmate,\n& See, 2007) or vocabulary/lexical memory (Dahlgren, 1998) often find that older adults outperform younger adults.\nHowever, older adults do find that they experience more \u201cblocks\u201d at retrieving information that they know. In other\nwords, they experience more tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) events than do younger adults (Schwartz, 2011). memory blocks\nare especially common for the retrieval of \u201cnonsense words\u201dor specific concept labels. Unfortunately for older\nadults, nonsense words include the names of people, places, and things (like movies, restaurants, or books)\u2013 which\nrepresent many common topics of conversation.\nImplicit memory requires little conscious effort and often involves skills or more habitual patterns of behavior. This\ntype of memory shows few declines with age. Many studies assessing implicit memory measure the effects of priming.\nPriming refers to changes in behavior as a result of frequent or recent experiences. for example, if you were shown pictures\nof food and asked to rate their appearance and then later were asked to complete words such as s_ _ p, you may be\nmore likely to write \u201csoup\u201d than \u201csoap\u201d or \u201cship.\u201d The images of food \u201cprimed\u201d your memory for words connected to food.\nDoes this type of memory and learning change with age? The answer is typically \u201cno\u201d for most older adults (Schacter,\nChurch, & Osowiecki, 1994).\nProspective memory refers to remembering things we need to do\nin the future, such as remembering a doctor\u2019s appointment or to\ntake medication before bedtime. It has been described as \u201cthe\nflip-side of episodic memory\u201d (Schwartz, 2011, p. 119). Episodic\nmemories are the recall of events in our past, while the focus of\nprospective memories is of events in our future. In general,\nhumans are fairly good at prospective memory if they have little\nelse to do in the meantime. However, when there are competing\ntasks that also demand our attention, this type of memory\nrapidly declines. One explanation given for this phenomenon is\nthat this form of memory draws on the central executive of\nworking memory, and when this component of working\nmemory is absorbed in other tasks, our ability to remember to\ndo something else in the future is more likely to slip out of\nFigure 10.15. Aids for prospective memory\nmemory (Schwartz, 2011).\nHowever, prospective memories are often divided into time-based prospective memories, such as having to remember\nto do something at a future time, or event-based prospective memories, such as having to remember to do something\nwhen a certain event occurs. When age-related declines are found, they are more likely to be time-based, rather than\nevent-based, and in laboratory settings rather than in the real-world, where older adults can show comparable or\nslightly better prospective memory performance (Henry, MacLeod, Phillips & Crawford, 2004; Luo & Craik, 2008). This\nshould not be surprising given the tendency of older adults to be more selective in where they place their physical,\nmental, and social energy. Having to remember a doctor\u2019s appointment is of greater concern than remembering to hit\nthe space-bar on a computer every time the word \u201ctiger\u201d is displayed, and outside the lab many more compensatory aids\n(e.g., post-it notes, calendars, phone alarms) are readily available.\nRecall versus Recognition. Memory performance often depends on whether older adults are asked to simply recognize\npreviously learned material or recall material on their own. Generally, for all humans, recognition tasks are easier\n380 | Late Adulthood because they require less cognitive energy. Older adults show roughly equivalent memory to young adults when\nassessed with a recognition task (Rhodes, Castel, & Jacoby, 2008). However, in recall tasks, older adults show memory\ndeficits in comparison to younger adults. While the effect is initially not that large, starting at age 40 adults begin to\nshow regular age-graded declines in recall memory compared to younger adults (Schwartz, 2011).\nThe Age Advantage. Fewer age differences are observed when memory cues are available, such as for recognition\nmemory tasks, or when individuals can draw upon acquired knowledge or experience. For example, older adults often\nperform as well if not better than young adults on tests of word knowledge or vocabulary. Expertise often comes with\nage, and research has pointed to areas where aging experts perform quite well. For example, older typists were found\nto compensate for age-related declines in speed by looking farther ahead at printed text (Salthouse, 1984). Compared\nto younger players, older chess experts focus on a smaller set of possible moves, leading to greater cognitive efficiency\n(Charness, 1981). Accrued knowledge of everyday tasks, such as grocery prices, can also help older adults make better\ndecisions than young adults (Tentori, Osheron, Hasher, & May, 2001).\nAttention and Problem Solving\nChanges in Attention in Late Adulthood. Changes in sensory functioning and speed of processing information in late\nadulthood often translate into changes in attention (Jefferies et al., 2015). Research has shown that older adults are less\nable to selectively focus on information while ignoring distractors (Jefferies et al., 2015; Wascher, Schneider, Hoffman,\nBeste, & S\u00e4nger, 2012), although Jefferies and her colleagues found that when given double time, older adults could\nperform at the same level as young adults. Other studies have also found that older adults have greater difficulty shifting\ntheir attention between objects or locations (Tales, Muir, Bayer, & Snowden, 2002).\nConsider the implication of these attentional changes for older adults. How does maintenance or loss of cognitive\nability affect older adults\u2019 everyday lives? Researchers have studied cognition in the context of several different everyday\nactivities. One example is driving. Although older adults often have more years of driving experience, cognitive declines\nrelated to reaction time or attentional processes may pose limitations under certain circumstances (Park & Gutchess,\n2000). In contrast, research on interpersonal problem solving suggests that older adults use more effective strategies\nthan younger adults to navigate through social and emotional problems (Blanchard-Fields, 2007). In the context of\nwork, researchers rarely find that older individuals perform more poorly on the job (Park & Gutchess, 2000). Similar to\neveryday problem solving, older workers may develop more efficient strategies and rely on expertise to compensate for\ncognitive declines.\nProblem Solving. Declines with age are found on problem-solving tasks that require processing non-meaningful\ninformation quickly\u2013 a kind of task that might be part of a laboratory experiment on mental processes. However, many\nreal-life challenges facing older adults do not rely on speed of processing or making choices on one\u2019s own. Older adults\nresolve everyday problems by relying on input from others, such as family and friends. They are also less likely than\nyounger adults to delay making decisions on important matters, such as medical care (Strough, Hicks, Swenson, Cheng\n& Barnes, 2003; Meegan & Berg, 2002).\nWhat might explain these deficits as we age? The processing speed theory, proposed by Salthouse (1996, 2004),\nsuggests that as the nervous system slows with advanced age our ability to process information declines. This slowing of\nprocessing speed may explain age differences on a variety of cognitive tasks. For instance, as we age, working memory\nbecomes less efficient (Craik & Bialystok, 2006). Older adults also need longer time to complete mental tasks or make\ndecisions. Yet, when given sufficient time (to compensate for declines in speed), older adults perform as competently as\ndo young adults (Salthouse, 1996). Thus, when speed is not imperative to the task, healthy older adults generally do not\nshow cognitive declines.\nIn contrast, inhibition theory argues that older adults have difficulty with tasks that require inhibitory functioning, or\nthe ability to focus on certain information while suppressing attention to less pertinent information (Hasher & Zacks,\nLate Adulthood | 381 1988). Evidence comes from directed forgetting research. In directed forgetting people are asked to forget or ignore some\ninformation, but not other information. For example, you might be asked to memorize a list of words but are then told\nthat the researcher made a mistake and gave you the wrong list and asks you to \u201cforget\u201d this list. You are then given a\nsecond list to memorize. While most people do well at forgetting the first list, older adults are more likely to recall more\nwords from the \u201cdirected-to-forget\u201d list than are younger adults (Andr\u00e9s, Van der Linden, & Parmentier, 2004).\nAging stereotypes exaggerate cognitive losses. While there are\ninformation processing losses in late adulthood, many argue\nthat research exaggerates normative losses in cognitive\nfunctioning during old age (Garrett, 2015). One explanation is\nthat the type of tasks that people are tested on tend to be\nmeaningless. For example, older individuals are not motivated\nto remember a random list of words in a study, but they are\nmotivated for more meaningful material related to their life,\nand consequently perform better on those tests. Another\nreason is that researchers often estimate age declines from age\ndifferences found in cross-sectional studies. However, when Figure 10.16\nage comparisons are conducted longitudinally (thus removing\ncohort differences from age comparisons), the extent of loss is much smaller (Schaie, 1994).\nA third possibility is that losses may be due to the disuse of various skills. When older adults are given structured\nopportunities to practice skills, they perform as well as they had previously. Although diminished speed is especially\nnoteworthy during late adulthood, Schaie (1994) found that when the effects of speed are statistically removed, fewer\nand smaller declines are found in other aspects of an individual\u2019s cognitive performance. In fact, Salthouse and Babcock\n(1991) demonstrated that processing speed accounted for all but 1% of age-related differences in working memory\nwhen testing individuals from ages 18 to 82. Finally, it is well established that hearing and vision decline as we age.\nLongitudinal research has found that deficits in sensory functioning explain age differences in a variety of cognitive\nabilities (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997). Not surprisingly, more years of education, higher income, and better health care\n(which go together) are associated with higher levels of cognitive performance and slower cognitive decline (Zahodne,\nStern, & Manly, 2015).\nBeyond Formal Operational Thought: Post-formal Development?\nAs mentioned previously, according to Piagetian theory, formal operational thought emerges during adolescents. The\nhallmark of this type of thinking is the ability to think abstractly or to consider possibilities and ideas about\ncircumstances not directly experienced. Thinking abstractly is only one characteristic of adult thought, however. If you\ncompare a 15 year-old with someone in their late 30s, you would probably find that the latter considers not only what\nis possible, but also what is likely. Why the change? The adult has gained experience and understands that possibilities\ndo not always become realities. They learn to base decisions on what is realistic and practical, not idealistic, and can make\nadaptive choices. Adults are also not as influenced by what others think.\nIn addition to moving toward more practical considerations, thinking in adulthood may also become more relativistic,\ndialectical, and systemic. These advanced ways of thinking are referred to as Postformal Thought (Sinnott,\n1998). Relativistic thinking refers to the appreciation of multiple perspectives, and the understanding that knowledge\ndepends on the perspective of the knower. In later life, adults are able to continue to entertain multiple perspectives\nsimultaneously, and also at the same time, in the face of all those possibilities, to make a decision, commit to a specific\ncourse of action, and carry it out. This suggests that such post-formal thought goes beyond cognition to the integration\nof thought and action.\nDialectical Thought. Abstract ideas that the adolescent believes in firmly may become standards by which the adult\n382 | Late Adulthood evaluates reality. Adolescents tend to think in dichotomies; ideas are true or false; good or bad; and there is no middle\nground. However, with experience, the adult comes to recognize that there is some right and some wrong in each\nposition, some good or some bad in a policy or approach, some truth and some falsity in a particular idea. This ability to\nappreciate essential paradox and to bring together salient aspects of two opposing viewpoints or positions is referred to\nas dialectical thought and is considered one of the most advanced aspects of postformal thinking (Basseches, 1984).\nSuch thinking is more realistic because very few positions, ideas, situations, or people are completely right or wrong.\nSo, for example, parents who were considered angels or devils by their adolescent children, to adult children, eventually\nbecome just people with strengths and weaknesses, endearing qualities, and faults.\nSystemic thinking refers to the capacity to think about entire systems of knowledge or ideas. This way of thinking\nrecognizes the complexity of the world around us, based on the inter-connectedness of multiple subsystems at\nmultiple levels. As you can imagine, such thinking is useful for tackling complex problems, and creating mental models\nthat suggest entry points or levers for solving them. When combined with expertise and experience, these modes of\nthought can be very powerful. Two good examples of systemic thinking in this class are the notion of meta-theories\nand the idea of higher-order contexts of development. Both require thinking about complex multi-level systems\u2013 like\nsystems of theories and ecological perspectives.\nDoes everyone reach postformal or even formal operational thought? Formal operational thought involves being able\nto think abstractly; however, this ability does not apply to all situations or all adults. Formal operational thought is\ninfluenced by experience and education. Some adults lead lives in which they are not challenged to think abstractly\nabout their world. Many adults do not receive any formal education and are not taught to think abstractly about\nsituations they have never experienced. Further, many people are not exposed to conceptual tools used to formally\nanalyze hypothetical situations. Those who do think abstractly may be able to do so more easily in some subjects than\nothers. For example, psychology majors may be able to think abstractly about psychology but be unable to use abstract\nreasoning in physics or chemistry. Abstract reasoning in a particular field requires a knowledge base that no one has in\nall areas. Consequently, our ability to think abstractly also depends on our experiences.\nIntelligence and Wisdom\nWhen looking at scores on traditional intelligence tests, tasks measuring verbal skills show minimal or no age-related\ndeclines, while scores on performance tests, which measure solving problems quickly, decline with age (Botwinick,\n1984). This profile mirrors crystalized and fluid intelligence. As you recall from last chapter, crystallized intelligence\nencompasses abilities that draw upon experience and knowledge. Measures of crystallized intelligence include vocabulary\ntests, solving number problems, and understanding texts. Fluid intelligence refers to information processing abilities,\nsuch as logical reasoning, remembering lists, spatial ability, and reaction time. Baltes (1993) introduced two additional\ntypes of intelligence to reflect cognitive changes in aging. Pragmatics of intelligence are cultural exposure to facts and\nprocedures that are maintained as one ages and are similar to crystalized intelligence. Mechanics of intelligence are\ndependent on brain functioning and decline with age, similar to fluid intelligence. Baltes indicated that pragmatics of\nintelligence show little decline and typically increase with age whereas mechanics decline steadily, staring at a relatively\nyoung age. Additionally, pragmatics of intelligence may compensate for the declines that occur with mechanics of\nintelligence. In summary, global cognitive declines are not typical as one ages, and individuals typically compensate for\nsome cognitive declines, especially processing speed.\nWisdom has been defined as \u201cexpert knowledge in the fundamental pragmatics of life that permits exceptional insight,\njudgment and advice about complex and uncertain matters\u201d (Baltes & Smith, 1990). A wise person is insightful and has\nknowledge that can be used to overcome obstacles in living. Does aging bring wisdom? While living longer brings\nexperience, it does not always bring wisdom. Paul Baltes and his colleagues (Baltes & Kunzmann, 2004; Baltes &\nStaudinger, 2000) suggest that wisdom is rare. In addition, the emergence of wisdom can be seen in late adolescence\nand young adulthood, with there being few gains in wisdom over the course of adulthood (Staudinger & Gluck, 2011).\nThis would suggest that factors other than age are stronger determinants of wisdom. Occupations and experiences\nLate Adulthood | 383 that emphasize others rather than self, along with personality characteristics, such as openness to experience and\ngenerativity, are more likely to provide the building blocks of wisdom (Baltes & Kunzmann, 2004). Age combined with a\ncertain types of experience and/or personality brings wisdom.\nReligion and Spirituality\nGrzywacz and Keyes (2004) found that in addition to personal health behaviors, such as regular exercise, healthy weight,\nand not smoking, social behaviors, including involvement in religious-related activities, have been shown to be positively\nrelated to optimal health. However, it is not only those who are involved in a specific religion that benefit, but so too\ndo those who identified themselves as being spiritual. According to Greenfield, Vaillant, and Marks (2009) religiosity\nrefers to engaging with a formal religious group\u2019s doctrines, values, traditions, and co-members. In contrast, spirituality\nrefers to an individual\u2019s intrapsychic sense of connection with something transcendent (that which exists apart from and\nnot limited by the material universe) and the subsequent feelings of awe, gratitude, compassion, and forgiveness. Research\nhas demonstrated a strong relationship between spirituality and psychological well-being, irrespective of an individual\u2019s\nreligious participation (Vaillant, 2008). Additionally, Sawatzky, Ratner, & Chiu (2005) found that spirituality was related\nto a higher quality of life for both individuals and societies.\nBased on reports from the 2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States, Greenfield et al. (2009) found that higher\nlevels of spirituality were associated with lower levels of negative affect and higher levels of positive affect, personal\ngrowth, purpose in life, positive relationships with others, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and autonomy. In\ncontrast, formal religious participation was associated with lower levels of autonomy but, among older adults, also with\nhigher levels of purpose in life and personal growth. In summary, it appears that formal religious participation and\nspirituality relate differently to an individual\u2019s overall psychological well-being.\nAge. Older individuals identify religion/spirituality as being more important in their lives than those younger (Beit-\nHallahmi & Argyle, 1998). This age difference has been explained by several factors including the likelihood that religion\nand spirituality provide opportunities for socialization and social support in later life, and assist older individuals in\ncoping with age-related losses. These age differences may also reflect cohort differences in that older individuals were\ntypically socialized to be more religious and spiritual than those younger (Greenfield et al., 2009).\nGender. In the United States, women report identifying as being more religious and spiritual than men do (de Vaus\n& McAllister, 1987). According to the Pew Research Center (2016), women in the United States are more likely to\nsay religion is very important in their lives than are men (60% vs. 47%). American women are also more likely than\nAmerican men to say they pray daily (64% vs. 47%) and attend religious services at least once a week (40% vs.\n32%). Theories to explain these gender difference include the notion that women may benefit more from the social-\nrelational aspects of religion/spirituality because social relationships more strongly influence women\u2019s mental health.\nAdditionally, compared to men, women have been socialized more to internalize the behaviors linked with religious\nvalues, such as cooperation and nurturance (Greenfield et al., 2009).\nWorldwide. To measure the religious beliefs and practices of men and women around the world, the Pew Research\nCenter (2016) conducted surveys of the general population in 84 countries between 2008 and 2015. Overall, an estimated\n83% of women worldwide identified with a religion compared with 80% of men. This equaled 97 million more women\nthan men identifying with a religion. There were no countries in which men were more religious than women by 2\npercentage points or more. Among Christians, women reported higher rates of weekly church attendance and higher\nrates of daily prayer. In contrast, Muslim women and Muslim men showed similar levels of religiosity, except frequency\nof attendance at worship services. Because of religious norms, Muslim men worshiped at a mosque more often than\nMuslim women. Similarly, Jewish men attended synagogue more often than Jewish women. In Orthodox Judaism,\ncommunal worship services cannot take place unless a minyan, or quorum of at least 10 Jewish men, is present, thus\nensuring that men will have high rates of attendance.

Most other developments across the rest of the lifespan\nrepresent sets of options, but this last step is not optional. It is where all our earthly journeys end. In this chapter, we\nexplain differences in life expectancy and the factors that influence length of life, as well as theories of aging itself. We\nconsider the end of life and how it is approached in different cultures. We examine the ways that conceptions of death\ndiffer and develop across childhood and adolescence, as well as processes of grief and bereavement and the factors that\ninfluence how they unfold and are resolved.\nLifespan and Life Expectancy: Healthy Aging\nLife Expectancy vs. Lifespan\nLifespan or maximum lifespan refer to the greatest age reached by any member of a given species (or population). For\nhumans, the lifespan is currently between 120 and 125. Life expectancy is defined as the average number of years that\nmembers of a species (or population) live. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019) global life expectancy\nfor those born in 2019 is 72.0 years, with females reaching 74.2 years and males reaching 69.8 years. Women live longer\nthan men around the world, and the gap between the sexes has remained the same since 1990. Overall life expectancy\nranges from 61.2 years in the WHO African Region to 77.5 years in the WHO European Region. Global life expectancy\nincreased by 5.5 years between 2000 and 2016. Improvements in child survival and access to antiretroviral medication\nfor the treatment of HIV are considered the main reasons for this increase. However, life expectancy in low-income\ncountries (62.7 years) is 18.1 years lower than in high-income countries (80.8 years). In high-income countries, the\nmajority of people who die are old, while in low-income countries almost one in three deaths are in children under\n5 years of age. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (2019) the United States ranks 45th in the world for life\nexpectancy.\nWorld Healthy Life Expectancy. A better way to appreciate the diversity of people in late adulthood is to go beyond\nchronological age and examine how well the person is aging. Many in late adulthood enjoy better than average health\nand social well-being and so are aging at an optimal level. In contrast, others experience poor health and dependence\nto a greater extent than would be considered typical. When looking at large populations, the WHO (2019) measures how\nmany equivalent years of full health on average a newborn baby is expected to have. This age, called The Healthy Life\nExpectancy, takes into account current age-specific mortality, morbidity, and disability risks. In 2016, the global Healthy\nLife Expectancy was 63.3 years up from 58.5 years in 2000. The WHO African Region had the lowest Healthy Life\nExpectancy at 53.8 years, while the WHO Western Pacific Region had the highest at 68.9 years.\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 397 Figure 10.17. Life expectancies around the world in 2015\nLife Expectancy in America. The overall life expectancy for a baby born in 2017 in the United States is 78.6 years,\ndecreasing from 78.7 years in 2016 and 78.8 years in 2015 (Arias & Xu, 2019). The decrease from 2016 occurred for males,\nchanging from 76.2 years to 76.1 years, while it did not change for females (81.1 years). Life expectancy at birth decreased\nby 0.1 year for the non-Hispanic white population (78.6 to 78.5). Life expectancy at birth did not change from 2016 for the\nnon-Hispanic black population (74.9), and the Hispanic population (81.8). Before this unprecedented two-year decline,\nlife expectancy had been increasing steadily for decades. Reasons given by the CDC for this decrease in life expectancy\ninclude deaths from drug overdoses, an increase in liver disease, and a rise in suicide rates (Saiidi, 2019). Figure 10.18\nshows the United States life expectancy from 2006-2017 by ethnicity and sex.\n398 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement Figure 10.18. US Life Expectancy by Sex and Ethnicity\nAmerican Healthy Life Expectancy. To determine the current United States Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE), factors were\nevaluated in 2007-2009 to determine how long an individual currently at age 65 will continue to experience good health\n(CDC, 2013). The highest Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) was observed in Hawaii with 16.2 years of additional good health,\nand the lowest was in Mississippi with only 10.8 years of additional good health. Overall, the lowest HLE was among\nsouthern states. Females had a greater HLE than males at age 65 years in every state and DC. HLE was greater for whites\nthan for blacks in DC and all states from which data were available, except in Nevada and New Mexico.\nBLUE ZONES\nRecent research on longevity reveals that people in some regions of the world live significantly longer\nthan people elsewhere. Efforts to study the common factors between these areas and the people who live\nthere is known as blue zone research. Blue zones are regions of the world where Dan Buettner claims\npeople live much longer than average. The term first appeared in his November 2005 National Geographic\nmagazine cover story, \u201cThe Secrets of a Long Life.\u201d Buettner identified five regions as \u201cBlue Zones\u201d: Okinawa\n(Japan); Sardinia (Italy); Nicoya (Costa Rica); Icaria (Greece); and the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda,\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 399 California. He offers an explanation, based on data and first hand observations, for why these populations\nlive healthier and longer lives than others.\nThe people inhabiting blue zones share common lifestyle characteristics that contribute to their longevity.\nThe Venn diagram below (Figure 10.19) highlights the following six shared characteristics among the people\nof Okinawa, Sardinia, and Loma Linda blue zones. Though not a lifestyle choice, they also live as isolated\npopulations with a related gene pool.\n\u2022 Family \u2013 put ahead of other concerns\n\u2022 Less smoking\n\u2022 Semi-vegetarianism \u2013 the majority of food consumed is derived from plants\n\u2022 Legumes commonly consumed\n\u2022 Constant moderate physical activity \u2013 an inseparable part of life\n\u2022 Social engagement \u2013 people of all ages are socially active and integrated into their communities\nIn his book, Buettner provides a list of nine lessons, covering the lifestyle of blue zones people:\n\u2022 Moderate, regular physical activity.\n\u2022 Life purpose.\n\u2022 Stress reduction.\n\u2022 Moderate caloric intake.\n\u2022 Plant-based diet.\n\u2022 Moderate alcohol intake, especially wine.\n\u2022 Engagement in spirituality or religion.\n\u2022 Engagement in family life.\n\u2022 Engagement in social life.\n400 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement Figure 10.19. Blue zones share many common healthy habits\ncontributing to longer lifespans.\nAlthough improvements have occurred in overall life expectancy, children born in America today may be the first\ngeneration to have a shorter life span than their parents. Much of this decline has been attributed to the increase\nin sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Since 1980, the obesity rate for children between the ages of 2 and 19 has tripled,\nas 20.5% of children were obese in 2014 compared with 5% in 1980 (American Medical Association, 2016). Obesity\nin children is associated with many health problems, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, elevated blood\ncholesterol levels, and psychological concerns including low self-esteem, negative body image, and depression. Excess\nweight is associated with an earlier risk of obesity-related diseases and death. In 2007, former Surgeon General Richard\nCarmona stated, \u201cBecause of the increasing rates of obesity, unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity, we may see\nthe first generation that will be less healthy and have a shorter life expectancy than their parents\u201d (p. 1).\nGender Differences in Life Expectancy\nSeveral explanations have been offered for the gender differences in average life expectancy that emerged in the late\n1800s\u2013 one focused on nature and the other on nurture.\nBiological Explanations. Biological differences in sex chromosomes and different pattern of gene expression are\ntheorized as one reason why females live longer (Chmielewski, Boryslawski, & Strzelec, 2016). Males are heterogametic\n(XY), whereas females are homogametic (XX) with respect to sex chromosomes. Males can only express the X\nchromosome genes that come from the mother, while females have the advantage of being able to select the \u201cbetter\u201d X\nchromosome from their mother or father, while inactivating the \u201cworse\u201d X chromosome. This process of selection for\n\u201cbetter\u201d genes is impossible in males and results in the greater genetic and developmental stability of females.\nIn terms of developmental biology, women are the \u201cdefault\u201d sex, which means that the creation of a male individual\nrequires a sequence of events at a molecular level. According to Chmilewski et al. (2016), these events are initiated by the\nactivity of the SRY gene located on the Y chromosome. This activity and change in the direction of development results\nin a greater number of disturbances and developmental disorders, because the normal course of development requires\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 401 many different factors and mechanisms, each of which must work properly and at a specific stage of the development\n(p. 134).\nMen are more likely to contract viral and bacterial infections, and their immunity at the cellular level decreases\nsignificantly faster with age. Although women are slightly more prone to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such\nas rheumatoid arthritis, the gradual deterioration of the immune system is slower in women (Caruso, Accardi, Virruso,\n& Candore, 2013; Hirokawa et al., 2013).\nLooking at the influence of hormones, estrogen levels in women appear to have a protective effect on their heart\nand circulatory systems (Vi\u00f1a, Borr\u00e1s, Gambini, Sastre, & Pallard\u00f3, 2005). Estrogens also have antioxidant properties\nthat protect against harmful effects of free radicals, which damage cell components, cause mutations, and are in part\nresponsible for the aging process. Testosterone levels are higher in men than in women and are related to more frequent\ncardiovascular and immune disorders. The level of testosterone is also responsible, in part, for male behavioral patterns,\nincluding increased level of aggression and violence (Martin, Poon, & Hagberg, 2011; Borys\u0142awski & Chmielewski, 2012).\nAnother factor responsible for risky behavior is the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe, which controls judgment\nand consideration of an action\u2019s consequences, develops more slowly in boys and young men. This lack of judgment\naffects lifestyle choices, and consequently many more boys and men die by smoking, excessive drinking, accidents,\ndrunk driving, and violence (Shmerling, 2016).\nLifestyle Factors. Certainly not all the reasons women live longer than men are biological. As previously mentioned,\nmale behavioral patterns and lifestyle play a significant role in the shorter lifespans for males. One significant factor is\nthat males work in more dangerous jobs, including police, fire fighters, and construction, and they are more exposed to\nviolence. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (2014) there were 11,961 homicides in the U.S. in 2014 (last year\nfor full data) and of those 77% were males. Further, males serve in the military in much larger numbers than females.\nAccording to the Department of Defense (2015), in 2014 83% of all officers in the Services (Navy, Army, Marine Corps\nand Air Force) were male, while 85% of all enlisted service members were male. Males are also more than three times as\nlikely to commit suicide (CDC, 2016a).\nAdditionally, men are less likely than women to have health insurance, develop a regular relationship with a doctor,\nor seek treatment for a medical condition (Scott, 2015). As mentioned in the middle adulthood chapter, women are\nmore religious than men, which is associated with healthier behaviors (Greenfield, Vaillant & Marks, 2009). Lastly, social\ncontact is also important as loneliness is considered a health hazard. Nearly 20% of men over 50 have contact with their\nfriends less than once a month, compared to only 12% of women who see friends that infrequently (Scott, 2015). Hence,\nmen\u2019s lower life expectancy appears to be due to both biological and lifestyle factors.\nTheories of Aging\nWhy do we age? There are many theories that attempt to explain how we age, but researchers still do not fully\nunderstand what factors contribute to the human lifespan (Jin, 2010). Research on aging is constantly evolving and\nincludes a variety of studies involving genetics, biochemistry, animal models, and human longitudinal studies (NIA,\n2011a). According to Jin (2010), modern biological theories of human aging involve two categories. The first is\nProgrammed Theories that follow a biological timetable, possibly a continuation of childhood development. This timetable\nwould depend on \u201cchanges in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair, and defense\nresponses,\u201d (p. 72). The second category includes Damage Theories which emphasize environmental factors that cause\ncumulative damage in organisms. Examples from each of these categories will be discussed.\nPrimary Aging: Programmed Theories\n402 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement Genetics. Genetic make-up certainly plays a role in longevity, but scientists are still attempting to identify which genes\nare responsible. Based on animal models, some genes promote longer life, while other genes limit longevity.\nSpecifically, longevity may be due to genes that better equip\nsomeone to survive a disease. For others, some genes may\naccelerate the rate of aging, while others slow that rate. To help\ndetermine which genes promote longevity and how they\noperate, researchers scan the entire genome and compare\ngenetic variants in those who live longer with those who have\nan average or shorter lifespan. For example, a National\nInstitutes of Health study identified genes possibly associated\nwith blood fat levels and cholesterol, both risk factors for\ncoronary disease and early death (NIA, 2011a). Researchers\nFigure 10.20 believe that it is most likely a combination of many genes that\naffect the rate of aging.\nCellular Clock Theory. This theory suggests that biological\naging is due to the fact that normal cells cannot divide\nindefinitely. This is known as the Hayflick limit, and is\nevidenced in cells studied in test tubes, which divide about\n40-60 times before they stop (Bartlett, 2014). But what is the\nmechanism behind this cellular senescence? At the end of each\nchromosomal strand is a sequence of DNA that does not code for\nany particular protein, but protects the rest of the chromosome,\nwhich is called a telomere.\nWith each replication, the telomere gets shorter. Once it\nbecomes too short the cell does one of three things. It can stop\nreplicating by turning itself off, called cellular senescence. It can\nstop replicating by dying, called apoptosis. Or, as in the\nFigure 10.21. Telomeres and cellular senescence\ndevelopment of cancer, it can continue to divide and become\nabnormal. Senescent cells can also create problems. While they\nmay be turned off, they are not dead, thus they still interact with other cells in the body and can lead to an increase risk\nof disease. When we are young, senescent cells may reduce our risk of serious diseases such as cancer, but as we age\nthey increase our risk of such problems (NIA, 2011a). The question of why cellular senescence changes from being\nbeneficial to being detrimental is still under investigation. The answer may lead to some important clues about the aging\nprocess.\nDNA Damage. Over time DNA, which contains the genetic code for all organisms, accumulates damage. This is usually\nnot a concern as our cells are capable of repairing damage throughout our life. Further, some damage is harmless.\nHowever, some damage cannot be repaired and remains in our DNA. Scientists believe that this damage, and the body\u2019s\ninability to fix itself, is an important part of aging (NIA, 2011a). As DNA damage accumulates with increasing age, it\ncan cause cells to deteriorate and malfunction (Jin, 2010). Factors that can damage DNA include ultraviolet radiation,\ncigarette smoking, and exposure to hydrocarbons, such as auto exhaust and coal (Dollemore, 2006).\nMitochondrial Damage. Damage to mitochondrial DNA can lead to a decaying of the mitochondria, which is a cell\norganelle that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. The mitochondria convert oxygen to adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP) which provides the energy for the cell. When damaged, mitochondria become less efficient and generate less\nenergy for the cell and can lead to cellular death (NIA, 2011a).\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 403 Free Radicals. When the mitochondria use oxygen to produce energy, they also\nproduce potentially harmful byproducts called oxygen free radicals (NIA, 2011a). The\nfree radicals are missing an electron and create instability in surrounding molecules by\ntaking electrons from them. There is a snowball effect (A takes from B and then B takes\nfrom C, etc.) that creates more free radicals which disrupt the cell and causes it to\nbehave abnormally (See Figure 10.22). Some free radicals are helpful as they can destroy\nbacteria and other harmful organisms, but for the most part they cause damage in our\ncells and tissue. Free radicals are identified with disorders seen in those of advanced\nage, including cancer, atherosclerosis, cataracts, and neurodegeneration. Some\nresearch has suggested that adding antioxidants to our diets can help counter the\neffects of free radical damage because the antioxidants can donate an electron that can\nneutralize damaged molecules. However, the research on the effectiveness of\nantioxidants is not conclusive (Harvard School of Public Health, 2016).\nImmune and Hormonal\nStress Theories. Ever notice\nhow quickly U.S. presidents\nseem to age? Before and after Figure 10.22. Free Radicals\nphotos reveal how stress can\nplay a role in the aging process. When gerontologists study\nstress, they are not just considering major life events, such as\nunemployment, death of a loved one, or the birth of a child.\nThey are also including metabolic stress, the life sustaining\nactivities of the body, such as circulating the blood, eliminating\nwaste, controlling body temperature, and neuronal firing in the\nFigure 10.23. Former President Obama brain. In other words, all the activities that keep the body alive\nalso create biological stress.\nTo understand how this stress affects aging, researchers note that both problems with the innate and adaptive immune\nsystem play key roles. The innate immune system is made up of the skin, mucous membranes, cough reflex, stomach acid,\nand specialized cells that alert the body of an impending threat. With age these cells lose their ability to communicate\nas effectively, making it harder for the body to mobilize its defenses. The adaptive immune system includes the tonsils,\nspleen, bone marrow, thymus, circulatory system and the lymphatic system that work to produce and transport T cells. T-\ncells, or lymphocytes, fight bacteria, viruses, and other foreign threats to the body. T-cells are in a \u201cna\u00efve\u201d state before\nthey are programmed to fight an invader and become \u201cmemory cells\u201d. These cells now remember how to fight a certain\ninfection should the body ever come across this invader again. Memory cells can remain in your body for many decades,\nwhich is why the measles vaccine you received as a child is still protecting you from this virus today. As older adults\nproduce fewer new T-cells to be programmed, they are less able to fight off new threats and new vaccines work less\neffectively. The reason why the shingles vaccine works well with older adults is because they already have some existing\nmemory cells against the varicella virus. The shingles vaccine is acting as a booster (NIA, 2011a).\nHormonal Stress Theory, also known as Neuroendocrine Theory of Aging, suggests that as we age the ability of the\nhypothalamus to regulate hormones in the body begins to decline leading to metabolic problems (American Federation\nof Aging Research (AFAR) 2011). This decline is linked to excessive levels of the stress hormone cortisol. While many\nof the body\u2019s hormones decrease with age, cortisol does not (NIH, 2014a). The more stress we experience, the more\ncortisol we release, and the more hypothalamic damage that occurs. Changes in hormones have been linked to several\nmetabolic and hormone related problems that increase with age, such as diabetes (AFAR, 2011), thyroid problems (NIH,\n2013), osteoporosis, and orthostatic hypotension (NIH, 2014a).\n404 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement Secondary Aging: Damage Theories\nA second set of theories focuses on aging as an outcome of the wear and tear our bodies receive as part of our daily\nlives. Damage theories examine the parts of aging and death that come from the outside. This perspective scrutinizes\nthe nurture or environmental side of the equation, and holds that the body wears out through the cumulative effects of\na host of life events and lifestyle factors, such as disease, disuse, abuse, stress, and environmental toxins. Evidence to\nsupport this position comes from three sources.\nLifestyle Factors that Predict Aging and Death. The first body of research supporting the role of nurture in aging\nexamines the effects of a variety of physical factors, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and substance abuse, as well\nas psychological factors, such as stress, social inactivity, and pessimistic outlook. Studies show that these factors can\npredict both how healthy people will be and how long they will live. Such forces can cause biological damage, which is\nrepaired more and more slowly as we age. From this perspective aging results from the accumulation of such damage.\nExposure to Environmental Toxins. A second body of evidence shows that aging can be shaped by exposure to\nenvironmental pollution, as caused for example by pesticides, air pollutants, and radiation, or by harmful substances\nadded to our food and water. When we metabolize these toxins, they do damage, not only to our bodies, but also to\nour our genetic DNA material at the cellular level. As our organ systems deteriorate and become more vulnerable, errors\npile up- and our body\u2019s ability to repair them slows down. Toxins can cause allergic reactions and auto-immune diseases,\nas seen in the upswing in Type II adult-onset diabetes and other chronic conditions. Effects of environmental toxins are\nalso seen in inflammatory processes involved in life threatening medical conditions, like cardiovascular disease, arthritis,\nand cancer.\nHistorical Increases in Average Life Expectancy. A third source of evidence that aging can be speeded up or slowed\ndown by external factors comes from documentation of steady historical increases in average life expectancy. These\nincreases follow from changes in external factors, mostly related to public health. They include historical reductions\nin the number of people in extreme poverty as well as improvements in nutrition, quality and access to medical\ncare, sanitation, child birth procedures, and the invention of antibiotics. These historical changes did not result in\nevolutionary changes in human biology. They produced recent changes in environmental factors that are shaping the\nrate of aging and the timing of death.\nIn sum, as you can see that aging and death are processes that are multiply determined\u2013 by biological, psychological,\nsocial, and contextual factors. Theories of primary aging are correct that we have the seeds of our aging programmed\ninto our bodies. But theories of secondary aging are also correct\u2013 the environment also speeds-up and slows down\nour aging and dying via the damage it does to our increasingly vulnerable biology. And, of course, lifespan researchers\nwould remind us that the active individual also plays a role through the decisions they make about behavioral risks,\nlike smoking, drinking, and using or abusing substances, as well as via more positive routes, especially a healthy\ndiet, exercise, and continued participation in positive social and cognitive activities.\nDying and Grieving in Children and Adolescents: Developmental Concepts of Death\nWhen we think of death and dying, we naturally focus on the elderly, and when we think of children in this process,\nwe typically think of adult children, who often act as caregivers for their aging and dying parents. However, children\nand adolescents are also involved in both dying and bereavement. An understanding of age-appropriate grief reactions\nand conceptions of death are important when assessing a child\u2019s response to their own terminal illness and how they\nare dealing with the death of a loved one. This section reviews key developmental concepts and describes strategies for\nsupporting children and adolescents who are grieving as well as those who are dying.\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 405 Children grieve differently than adults. They often grieve in spurts and can re-grieve at new developmental stages as\ntheir understanding of death and perceptions of the world change. Childhood grief may be expressed as behavioral\nchanges and/or emotional expression. The two most important predictive factors of a child\u2019s successful resolution\nafter suffering a loss are the availability of one significant adult and the provision of a safe physical and emotional\nenvironment.\nDying and Grieving during Infancy (0-2 years)\nChildren at this age have no cognitive understanding of death. If they themselves are dying, they are not aware of this\nfact. Their reactions are based completely on local conditions, including their contact with caregivers and their own\ncurrent levels of pain and suffering. Infants can be comforted by the presence of secure attachment figures and palliative\ncare to reduce pain. The process of dying is much more psychologically painful for caregivers than for infants, but\nhospitals and hospice care know how important the active participation of a caring and responsive attachment figure\ncan be, one who is making medical decisions based on the balance between the probability that a treatment will be\neffective (vs. prolong the dying process) and the pain that treatments cause.\nIn terms of infants\u2019 reactions to the death of a loved one, even if infants are not cognitively aware of death, they\nare cognizant of separation and loss, and so separation anxiety and grief reactions are possible. Behavioral and\ndevelopmental regression can occur as children have difficulty identifying and dealing with their loss; they may react in\nconcert with the distress experienced by their caregiver. There is a need to maintain routines and to avoid separation\nfrom significant others.\nIf the death is the primary attachment figure, the presence of grief and the severity of the infant\u2019s reaction will depend\non their age and the quality of care they receive from their new primary caregiver. Before the age of 6 months, the long\nterm effects of maternal death depend almost entirely on whether a sensitive responsive substitute caregiver can be\nfound who can take over immediately. For children older than 6 months, who have formed a specific attachment to the\nprimary caregiver, expressions of grief and loss are common, but the transition is easier if the new primary caregiver\nis someone who the infant or toddler knows and with whom they already have a trusting relationship (e.g., father, aunt,\ngrandmother). As mentioned previously, children may repeatedly revisit and re-grieve the loss of a primary caregiver at\nsuccessive ages as they develop cognitive capacities that allow them to to reflect on the loss in qualitatively different\nways.\nDying and Grieving during Early Childhood (2-6 years)\nPreschool age children see death as temporary and reversible. They interpret their world in a literal manner and may\nask questions reflecting this perspective. When children themselves are facing death, they take their cues about what is\nhappening almost entirely from their caregivers and the other people around them. They have typical developmentally-\ngraded concerns about attachment and abandonment, and have a hard time understanding why they have to accept\npainful treatments and why they can\u2019t just go home and get back to life as usual. They can have tantrums and difficulty\nregulating their emotions and behaviors, and it can be hard for parents to discipline or set limits with a terminally ill\nchild. However, the same kinds of high quality parenting that are good for children in other circumstances, namely,\nlove (affection, caring, and concern) combined with firm and reasonable limits, and autonomy support (validation and\nopportunities for free expression of preferences and perspectives), are helpful for young children in these situations.\nYoung children should be protected from adult anguish, but they can sense when adults are upset. Small children benefit\nfrom familiar routines, assurances that familiar adults are going to be with them the whole time, support for whatever\nemotions children are actually experiencing, and developmentally-attuned explanations and answers to young\nchildren\u2019s questions.\nWhen preschool aged children are dealing with the death of a loved one, especially a central person in their lives, like\na mother, father, or sibling, their conception of death makes the process of grieving more difficult. They may believe\n406 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement that death can be caused by thoughts and provide magical explanations, often blaming themselves for the death. The\nconviction that death is reversible makes it difficult for preschoolers to cognitively accept the death as final. They\nsometimes beg parents to go get the dead person and bring them back home, and they can become frantic if they are\ntold that the person has been buried. In the context of this conception of death, it is challenging to provide simple and\nstraightforward explanations that emphasize that the child is not to blame, that the loved one cannot return even though\nthey did not want to go, and that the absent person still loves the child.\nEven when adults avoid euphemisms and try to correct misperceptions, preschool children often regard death like a\nkidnapping (with the dead person taken far away against their will) until they reach the concrete operational stage of\ncognitive development, when they rework their understanding of the death. It is this combination of developmental\ncharacteristics\u2013 when a young child has a full-blown attachment to a primary caregiver and a conception of death\nthat makes it impossible to accept death as final\u2013 that puts children this age at particular risk for complicated grief\nand long-term negative neurophysiological and psychological effects. As with infants, the greatest protection against\ndevelopmental risk is provided by the immediate presence of a loving and stable attachment figure, preferably one to\nwhom the young child is already securely attached.\nDying and Grieving during the Stage of Concrete Operational Development\nMiddle childhood (6-8 years). When children reach the concrete operational stage of cognitive development, they\nunderstand that death is final and irreversible but do not believe that it is universal or could happen to them. Death is\noften personalized and/or personified. Expressions of anger towards the deceased or towards those perceived to have\nbeen unable to save the deceased can occur. Anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatic complaints may be present.\nThe child often has fears about death and concerns about the safety of their other loved ones. In addition to giving clear,\nrealistic information, offer to include the child in funeral ceremonies. Notifying the school will help teachers understand\nthe child\u2019s reaction and provide additional adult support.\nPreadolescence (8-12 years). Children at this age have an adult understanding of death \u2013 that it is final, irreversible,\nand universal. They are able to understand the biological aspects of death as well as cause-and-effect relationships.\nThey tend to intellectualize death as many have not yet learned to identify and deal with feelings. They may develop a\nmorbid curiosity and are often interested in the physical details of the dying process as well as religious and cultural\ntraditions surrounding death. The ability to identify causal relationships can lead to feelings of guilt; such feelings\nshould be explored and addressed. To facilitate identification with emotions, it may prove useful to talk about your own\nemotions surrounding death and to offer opportunities for the child to discuss death. The child should also be allowed\nto participate, as much as they feel comfortable, in seeing the dying patient and participating in activities surrounding\nthe death.\nDuring middle childhood and preadolescence, children have a concrete operational understanding of death. When\nchildren in this stage are themselves terminally ill and facing their own death, their concrete understanding of death\ncan lead to a relatively matter-of-fact acknowledgement of the actual situation. At this age, adults should still follow the\nchild\u2019s lead in terms of questions and explanations, and share their own grief and sadness only as appropriate. Children\nmay show a wide variety of emotions, but they still have developmentally-graded concerns focused, for example, on\nkeeping up with their friends and their schoolwork. To the extent that the parents of a child\u2019s friends are willing to\nlet them keep the dying child company, the presence of friends can provide both distraction and comfort to the child.\nConnections with friends can also be maintained through letters, notes, phone conversations, and virtual meetings,\nwhere the friends can play games or work together on their homework.\nDying and Grieving during Adolescence (12-18 years)\nAdolescents also have an adult understanding of death. At the same time, however, they are also developing the ability to\nthink abstractly and are often curious of the existential implications of death. They often reject adult rituals and support\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 407 and feel that no one understands them. They may engage in high-risk activities in order to more fully challenge their\nown mortality. They often have strong emotional reactions and may have difficulty identifying and expressing feelings.\nIt is important that adults support independence and access to peers, but also provide emotional support when needed.\nWhen adolescents face their own deaths, they also have full blown emotional and psychological reactions. Like adults,\nthey can grieve the lives and possibilities that are lost with death at a young age. Parents and peers can help them create\nlegacy projects, like blogs, videos, music, or books, that can enable adolescents to feel that they have accomplished at\nleast some parts of their life purposes. However, they remain adolescents, with developmentally-appropriate concerns\nand problems. For example, the emotional instability and need for autonomy that is characteristic of adolescence\ncan sometimes make it difficult for parents to provide helpful support under such circumstances. Adolescents can\nget into arguments with parents about whether or not they will accept certain medical treatments, especially if\nthe treatments affect their physical appearance. Adolescents, especially young adolescents, can find life-threatening\ndiseases embarrassing, because it makes them different from their peers during a time when they are concerned with\npeer conformity. However, adults can rest assured that even if they do not always acknowledge it, adolescents count on\nthe presence, wisdom, and support of their parents.\nIn sum, the generalizations and strategies provided here only serve as a framework when helping a child come to terms\nwith their own death or that of a loved one. The overarching message is that children and adolescents have age-graded\nconceptions of death, and developmentally-appropriate concerns and challenges in dealing with grieving and dying.\nThey also need individually and developmentally attuned supports during these processes, which can be demanding for\ntheir adults. When in doubt, seek help from pediatricians, child-life specialists, mental health professionals, and others\nspecializing in bereavement.\nLoss during Childhood\nLoss of a family member. For a child, the death of a parent, without support to manage the effects of the grief, may\nresult in long-term psychological harm. This is more likely if adult caregivers are struggling with their own grief and\nare psychologically unavailable to the child. The surviving parent or caregiver plays a crucial role in helping the child\nadapt to a parent\u2019s death. Studies have shown that losing a parent at a young age does not just lead to negative\noutcomes; there are also some potentially positive effects. Some children showed increased maturity, better coping, and\nimproved communications skills. Adolescents who have lost a parent value other people more than those who have not\nexperienced such a close loss (Ellis & Lloyd-Williams, 2008).\nThe loss of a parent, grandparent, or sibling can be very troubling in childhood, but even in childhood there are age\ndifferences in relation to the loss. A very young child, under six months of age, may have no reaction if a caregiver dies,\nbut older children are typically affected by the loss. This is especially true if the loss occurs during the time when trust\nand dependency are formed. During critical periods such as 8\u201312 months, when attachment and separation anxiety are\nat their height, even a brief separation from a parent or other person who cares for the child can cause distress.\nEven as a child grows older, death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds. For example, younger\nchildren see death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. Reactions can manifest\nthemselves in \u201cacting out\u201d behaviors: a return to earlier behaviors such as sucking thumbs, clinging to a toy or angry\nbehavior; though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity. As children enter\npre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding, but strong emotional reactions are still normal.\nLoss of a friend or classmate. Children may experience the death of a friend or a classmate through illness, accidents,\nsuicide, or violence. Loss from sudden violence, like drive by or school shootings, are particularly traumatic. Initial\nsupport involves reassuring children that they are safe, that their emotional and physical feelings are normal, and that\nsupport is available. Schools are advised to plan for these possibilities in advance. Planning and participating in rituals\n408 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement and memorials may be helpful, but will also challenging. Some children choose to continue visiting with the parents or\nfamily of their dead friend or classmate, to keep the connection, share the loss, and comfort the family.\nOther forms of loss. Children can experience grief as a result of losses due to causes other than death. For example,\nchildren may grieve losses connected with divorce and pine for the original family that has been forever lost. As with\nother losses, they may re-grieve this transition as they get older and have more sophisticated cognitive capacities to\nreflect on and rework the meaning of the divorce. Relocations can also cause children significant grief particularly if\nthey are combined with other difficult circumstances such as neglectful or abusive parental behaviors, other significant\nlosses, etc. It is also possible for children who have been physically, psychologically, or sexually abused to grieve over\nthe damage to or the loss of their ability to trust. Since such children usually have no support or acknowledgement from\nany source outside the family unit, this is likely to be experienced as disenfranchised grief.\nEnd-of-Life\nK\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019 Stages of Loss\nBased on her work and interviews with terminally ill patients, K\u00fcbler-Ross (1975) described five stages of\nloss experienced by someone who faces the news of their impending untimely death. These \u201cstages\u201d are not really\nstages that a person goes through in order or only once; nor are they stages that occur with the same intensity. Indeed,\nthe process of death is influenced by a person\u2019s life experiences, the timing of their death in relation to life events, the\npredictability of their death based on health or illness, their belief system, and their assessment of the quality of their\nown life. Nevertheless, these stages provide a framework to help us to understand and recognize some of what a dying\nperson experiences psychologically. And by understanding, we are more equipped to support that person as they die\nand to face death ourselves when our time comes (K\u00fcbler-Ross, 1975).\nDenial is often the first reaction to overwhelming, unimaginable news. Denial, or disbelief or shock, protects us by\nallowing such news to enter slowly and to give us time to come to grips with what is taking place. The person who\nreceives positive test results for a life-threatening condition may question the diagnosis, seek second opinions, or may\nsimply feel a sense of psychological disbelief even though they know that the results are true.\nAnger also provides us with protection in that being angry energizes us to fight against something and gives structure\nto a situation that may be thrusting us into the unknown. It is much easier to be angry than to be sad or in pain or\ndepressed. It helps us to temporarily believe that we have a sense of control over our future and to feel that we have at\nleast expressed our rage about how unfair life can be. Anger can be focused on a person, a health care provider, at God,\nor at the world in general. And it can be expressed over issues that have nothing to do with our death; consequently,\nbeing in this stage of loss is not always obvious.\nBargaining involves trying to think of what could be done to turn the situation around. Living better, devoting oneself\nto a cause, being a better friend, parent, or spouse, are all agreements one might willingly commit to if doing so would\nlengthen life. Asking to just live long enough to witness a family event or finish a task are examples of bargaining.\nDepression is sadness and sadness is appropriate for such an event. Feeling the full weight of loss, crying, and losing\ninterest in the outside world is an important part of the process of dying. This depression makes others feel very\nuncomfortable and family members may try to console their loved one. Sometimes hospice care may include the use of\nantidepressants to reduce depression during this stage.\nAcceptance involves learning how to carry on and to incorporate this aspect of the life span into daily existence.\nReaching acceptance does not in any way imply that people who are dying are happy about it or content with it. It means\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 409 that they are facing it and continuing to make arrangements and to say what they wish to say to others. Some terminally\nill people find that they live life more fully than ever before after they come to this stage.\nIn some ways, these five stages serve as coping mechanisms, allowing the individual to make sense of the situation\nwhile coming to terms with what is happening. They are, in other words, the mind\u2019s way of gradually recognizing the\nimplications of one\u2019s impending death and giving him or her the chance to process it. These stages provide a type of\nframework in which dying is experienced, although it is not exactly the same for every individual in every case. when\ndeath is on time and comes at the an advanced age, people have had more opportunity to come to grips with impending\ndeath and so may show only acceptance. In fact, research shows that as people age, they become less and less afraid of\ndeath, so that for many who are old-old (i.e., 85+ years), death seems like a natural next step.\nSince K\u00fcbler-Ross presented these stages of loss, several other models have been developed. These subsequent models,\nin many ways, build on that of K\u00fcbler-Ross, offering expanded views of how individuals process loss and grief. While\nK\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019 model was restricted to dying individuals, subsequent theories tended to focus on loss as a more general\nconstruct. This ultimately suggests that facing one\u2019s own death is just one example of the grief and loss that human\nbeings can experience, and that other loss or grief-related situations tend to be processed in a similar way.\nCultural Differences in End-of-Life Decisions\nCultural factors strongly influence how doctors, other health care providers, and family members communicate bad\nnews to patients, the expectations regarding who makes the health care decisions, and attitudes about end-of-life care\n(Ganz, 2019; Searight & Gafford, 2005a). In Western medicine, doctors take the approach that patients should be told\nthe truth about their health. Blank (2011) reports that 75% of the world\u2019s population do not conduct medicine by the\nsame standards. Thus, outside Western nations, and even among certain racial and ethnic groups within the those\nnations, doctors and family members may conceal the full nature of a terminal illness, as revealing such information is\nviewed as potentially harmful to the patient, or at the very least is seen as disrespectful and impolite. Chattopadhyay\nand Simon (2008) reported that in India doctors routinely abide by the family\u2019s wishes and withhold information from\nthe patient, while in Germany doctors are legally required to inform the patient. In addition, many doctors in Japan and\nin numerous African nations used terms such as \u201cmass,\u201d \u201cgrowth,\u201d and \u201cunclean tissue\u201d rather than referring to cancer\nwhen discussing the illness to patients and their families (Holland, Geary, Marchini, &Tross, 1987). Family members also\nactively protect terminally ill patients from knowing about their illness in many Hispanic, Chinese, and Pakistani cultures\n(Kaufert & Putsch, 1997; Herndon & Joyce, 2004).\nIn western medicine, we view the patient as autonomous in\nhealth care decisions (Chattopadhyay & Simon, 2008; Searight\n& Gafford, 2005a). However, in other nations the family or\ncommunity plays the main role, or decisions are made primarily\nby medical professionals, or the doctors in concert with the\nfamily make the decisions for the patient. For instance, in\ncomparison to European Americans and African Americans,\nKoreans and Mexican-Americans are more likely to view family\nmembers as the decision makers rather than just the patient\n(Berger, 1998; Searight & Gafford, 2005a). In many Asian Figure 10.24\ncultures, illness is viewed as a \u201cfamily event\u201d, not just something\nthat impacts the individual patient (Blank, 2011; Candib, 2002; Chattopadhyay & Simon, 2008). Thus, there is an\nexpectation that the family has a say in the health care decisions. As many cultures attribute high regard and respect for\ndoctors, patients and families may defer some of the end-of-life decision making to the medical professionals (Searight\n& Gafford, 2005b).\nThe notion of advanced directives, which spell out a patient\u2019s wishes for end-of-life-care, hold little or no relevance\n410 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement in many cultures outside of western society (Blank, 2011). For instance, in India advanced directives are virtually non-\nexistent, while in Germany they are regarded as a major part of health care (Chattopadhyay & Simon, 2008). Moreover,\nend-of-life decisions involve how much medical aid should be used. In the United States, Canada, and most European\ncountries artificial feeding is more commonly used once a patient has stopped eating, while in many other nations lack\nof eating is seen as a sign, rather than a cause, of dying and do not consider using a feeding tube (Blank, 2011).\nAccording to a Pew Research Center Survey (Lipka, 2014), while death may not be\na comfortable topic to ponder, 37% of their survey respondents had given a great\ndeal of thought about their end-of-life wishes, with 35% having put these in\nwriting. Yet, over 25% had given no thought to this issue. Lipka (2014) also found\nthat there were clear racial and ethnic differences in end-of-life wishes (see\nFigure 10.25). Whites are more likely than Blacks and Hispanics to prefer to have\ntreatment stopped if they have a terminal illness. In contrast, the majority of\nBlacks (61%) and Hispanics (55%) prefer that everything be done to keep them\nalive. Searight and Gafford (2005a) suggest that the low rate of completion of\nadvanced directives among non-whites may reflect a distrust of the U.S. health\ncare system as a result of the health care disparities non-whites have\nexperienced. Among Hispanics, patients may also be reluctant to select a single\nfamily member to be responsible for end-of-life decisions out of a concern of\nisolating the person named and of offending other family members, as this is\ncommonly seen as a \u201cfamily responsibility\u201d (Morrison, Zayas, Mulvihill, Baskin, &\nMeier, 1998).\nFigure 10.25\nReligious Practices after Death\nFuneral rites are expressions of loss that reflect personal and cultural beliefs about the meaning of death and the\nafterlife. Ceremonies provide survivors a sense of closure after a loss. These rites and ceremonies send the message\nthat the death is real and allow friends and loved ones to express their love and respect for those who die. Under\ncircumstances in which a person has been lost and presumed dead or when family members were unable to attend a\nfuneral, there can continue to be a lack of closure that makes it difficult to grieve and to learn to live with loss. Although\nmany people are still in shock when they attend funerals, the ceremony still provides a marker of the beginning of a new\nperiod of one\u2019s life as a survivor. The following are some of the religious practices regarding death, however, individual\nreligious interpretations and practices may occur (Dresser & Wasserman, 2010; Schechter, 2009).\nHinduism. The Hindu belief in reincarnation accelerates the funeral ritual, and deceased Hindus are cremated as soon\nas possible. After being washed, the body is anointed, dressed, and then placed on a stand decorated with flowers ready\nfor cremation. Once the body has been cremated, the ashes are collected and, if possible, dispersed in one of India\u2019s holy\nrivers.\nJudaism. Among the Orthodox, the deceased is first washed and then wrapped in a simple white shroud. Males are also\nwrapped in their prayer shawls. Once shrouded the body is placed into a plain wooden coffin. The burial must occur\nas soon as possible after death, and a simple service consisting of prayers and a eulogy is given. After burial the family\nmembers typically gather in one home, often that of the deceased, and receive visitors. This is referred to as \u201csitting\nshiva\u201d.\nMuslim. In Islam the deceased are buried as soon as possible, and it is a requirement that the community be involved in\nthe ritual. The individual is first washed and then wrapped in a plain white shroud called a kafan. Next, funeral prayers\nare said followed by the burial. The shrouded dead are placed directly in the earth without a casket and deep enough\nnot to be disturbed. They are also positioned in the earth, on their right side, facing Mecca, Saudi Arabia.\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 411 Roman Catholic. Before death an ill Catholic individual is anointed by a priest, commonly referred to as the Anointing\nof the Sick. The priest recites a prayer and applies consecrated oil to the forehead and hands of the ill person. The\nindividual also takes a final communion consisting of consecrated bread and wine. The funeral rites consist of three\nparts. First is the wake that usually occurs in a funeral parlor. The body is present, and prayers and eulogies are offered\nby family and friends. The funeral mass is next which includes an opening prayer, bible readings, liturgy, communion,\nand a concluding rite. The funeral then moves to the cemetery where a blessing of the grave, scripture reading, and\nprayers conclude the funeral ritual.\nGreen Burial\nIn 2017, the median cost of an adult funeral with viewing and\nburial was $8,775. The median cost for viewing and cremation\nwas $6,260 (National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA),\n2019). The same NFDA survey found that nearly half of all\nrespondents had attended a funeral in a non-traditional setting,\nsuch as an outdoor setting that was meaningful to the\ndeceased, and over half of the respondents said they would be\ninterested in exploring green funeral options (NFDA, 2017).\nAccording to the Green Burial Council (GBC) (2019) Americans\nbury over 64 thousand tons of steel, 17 thousand tons of copper\nand bronze, 1.6 million tons of concrete, 20 million feet of wood,\nand over 4 million gallons of embalming fluid every year. As a\nFigure 10.26 Green burial site in the UK\nresult, there has been a growing interest in green or natural\nburials. Green burials attempt to reduce the impact on the environment at every stage of the funeral. This can include\nusing recycled paper, biodegradable caskets, cotton shroud in the place of any casket, formaldehyde free, or no\nembalming, and trying to maintain the natural environment around the burial site (GBC, 2019). According to the NFDA\n(2017), many cemeteries have reported that consumers are requesting green burial options, and since many of the add-\nons of a traditional burial, such as a concrete vault, embalming, and casket are not required, the cost can be substantially\nless.\nOptional Reading:\nCurative, Palliative, and Hospice Care\nWhen individuals become ill, they need to make choices about the treatment they wish to receive. One\u2019s\nage, type of illness, and personal beliefs about dying affect the type of treatment chosen (Bell, 2010).\nCurative care is designed to overcome and cure disease and illness (Fox, 1997). Its aim is to promote complete\nrecovery, not just to reduce symptoms or pain. An example of curative care would be chemotherapy. While\ncuring illness and disease is an important goal of medicine, it is not its only goal. As a result, some have\ncriticized the curative model as ignoring the other goals of medicine, including preventing illness, restoring\nfunctional capacity, relieving suffering, and caring for those who cannot be cured.\nPalliative care focuses on providing comfort and relief from physical and emotional pain to patients\nthroughout their illness, even while being treated (NIH, 2007). In the past, palliative care was confined to\noffering comfort for the dying. Now it is offered whenever patients suffer from chronic illnesses, such as\ncancer or heart disease (IOM, 2015). Palliative care is also part of hospice programs.\n412 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement Hospice emerged in the United Kingdom in the mid-20th century as a result of the work of Cicely Saunders.\nThis approach became popularized in the U.S. by the work of Elizabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross (IOM, 2015), and by 2012\nthere were 5,500 hospice programs in the U.S. (National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO),\n2013).\nHospice care whether at home, in a hospital,\nnursing home, or hospice facility involves a team of\nprofessionals and volunteers who provide terminally\nill patients with medical, psychological, and spiritual\nsupport, along with support for their families\n(Shannon, 2006). The aim of hospice is to help the\ndying be as free from pain as possible, and to\ncomfort both the patients and their families during\na difficult time.\nIn order to enter hospice, a patient must be\ndiagnosed as terminally ill with an anticipated death\nFigure 10.28\nwithin 6 months (IOM, 2015). The patient is allowed\nto go through the dying process without invasive treatments. Hospice workers try to inform the family of\nwhat to expect and reassure them that much of what they see is a normal part of the dying process.\nAccording to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (2019) there are four types of hospice\ncare in America:\n\u2022 Routine hospice care, where the patient has chosen to receive hospice care at home, is the most\ncommon form of hospice.\n\u2022 Continuous home care is predominantly nursing care, with caregiver and hospice aides\nsupplementing this care, to manage pain and acute symptom crises for 8 to 24 hours in the home.\n\u2022 Inpatient respite care is provided by a hospital, hospice, or long-term care facility to provide\ntemporary relief for family caregivers.\n\u2022 General inpatient care is provided by a hospital, hospice, or long-term care facility when pain and\nacute symptom management can on be handled in other settings.\nIn 2017, an estimated 1.5 million people residing in America received hospice care (NHPCO, 2019). The\nmajority of patients on hospice were patients suffering from dementia, heart disease, or cancer, and\ntypically did not enter hospice until the last few weeks prior to death. Almost one out of three patients were\non hospice for less than a week.\nAccording to Shannon (2006), the basic elements of hospice include:\n\u2022 Care of the patient and family as a single unit\n\u2022 Pain and symptom management for the patient\n\u2022 Having access to day and night care\n\u2022 Coordination of all medical services\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 413 \u2022 Social work, counseling, and pastoral services\n\u2022 Bereavement counseling for the family up to one year after the patient\u2019s death\nAlthough hospice care has become more widespread, these new programs are subject to more rigorous\ninsurance guidelines that dictate the types and amounts of medications used, length of stay, and types of\npatients who are eligible to receive hospice care (Weitz, 2007). Thus, more patients are being served, but\nproviders have less control over the services they provide, and lengths of stay are more limited. In addition,\na recent report by the Office of the Inspector General at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n(2018) highlighted some of the vulnerabilities of the hospice system in the U.S. Among the concerns raised\nwere that hospices did not always provide the care that was needed and sometimes the quality of that care\nwas poor, even at Medicare certified facilities.\nNot all racial and ethnic groups feel the same way about hospice care. African-American families may\nbelieve that medical treatment should be pursued on behalf of an ill relative as long as possible and that only\nGod can decide when a person dies. Chinese-American families may feel very uncomfortable discussing\nissues of death or being near the deceased family member\u2019s body. The view that hospice care should always\nbe used is not held by everyone, and health care providers need to be sensitive to the wishes and beliefs of\nthose they serve (Coolen, 2012).\nFamily Caregivers\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine (2015), it is estimated that 66 million Americans, or 29% of the adult\npopulation, are caregivers for someone who is dying or chronically ill. Two-thirds of these caregivers are\nwomen. This care takes its toll physically, emotionally, and financially. Family caregivers may face the\nphysical challenges of lifting, dressing, feeding, bathing, and transporting a dying or ill family member. They\nmay worry about whether they are performing all tasks safely and properly, as they receive little training or\nguidance. Such caregiving tasks may also interfere with their ability to take care of themselves and meet\nother family and workplace obligations. Financially, families may face high out of pocket expenses (IOM,\n2015).\nAs can be seen in Table 10.6, most family caregivers are providing care by themselves with little professional\nintervention, are employed, and have provided care for more than 3 years. The annual loss of productivity in\nthe U.S. was $25 billion in 2013 as a result of work absenteeism due to providing this care. As the prevalence\nof chronic disease rises, the need for family caregivers is growing. Unfortunately, the number of potential\nfamily caregivers is declining as the large baby boomer generation enters into late adulthood (Redfoot,\nFeinberg, & Houser, 2013).\n414 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement Table 10.6 Characteristics of Family Caregivers in the United States\nCharacteristic Percentages\nNo home visits by health care professionals 69%\nCaregivers are also employed 72%\nDuration of employed workers who have been caregiving for 3+ years 55%\nCaregivers for the elderly 67%\nadapted from Lally & Valentine-French (2019) and IOM (2015)\nAdvanced Directives\nAdvanced care planning refers to all documents that pertain to end-of-life care. These include advance\ndirectives and medical orders. Advance directives include documents that mention a health care agent and\nliving wills. These are initiated by the patient. Living wills are written or video statements that outline the\nhealth care initiates the person wishes under certain circumstances. Durable power of attorney for health\ncare names the person who should make health care decisions in the event that the patient is incapacitated. In\ncontrast, medical orders are crafted by a medical professional on behalf of a seriously ill patient. Unlike\nadvanced directives, as these are doctor\u2019s orders, they must be followed by other medical personnel.\nMedical orders include Physician Orders for Life-sustaining Treatment (POLST), do-not-resuscitate, do-\nnot-incubate, or do-not-hospitalize. In some instances, medical orders may be limited to the facility in\nwhich they were written. Several states have endorsed POLST so that they are applicable across heath care\nsettings (IOM, 2015).\nDespite the fact that many Americans worry about the financial burden of end-of-life care, \u201cmore than one-\nquarter of all adults, including those aged 75 and older, have given little or no thought to their end-of-life\nwishes, and even fewer have captured those wishes in writing or through conversation\u201d (IOM, 2015, p. 18).\nGrief, Bereavement, and Mourning\nThe terms grief, bereavement, and mourning are often used interchangeably, however, they have different meanings.\nGrief is the normal process of reacting to a loss. Grief can be in response to a physical loss, such as a death, or a social loss\nincluding a relationship or job. Bereavement is the period after a loss during which grief and mourning occurs. The time\nspent in bereavement for the loss of a loved one depends on the circumstances of the loss and the level of attachment to\nthe person who died. Mourning is the process by which people adapt to a loss. Mourning is greatly influenced by cultural\nbeliefs, practices, and rituals (Casarett, Kutner, & Abrahm,2001).\nThe Process of Grieving\nTypical grief reactions involve emotional, mental, physical, and social responses. These reactions can include feelings\nof numbness, anger, guilt, anxiety, sadness, and despair. The individual can experience difficulty concentrating, sleep\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 415 and eating problems, loss of interest in formerly pleasurable activities, physical problems, and even illness. Research\nhas demonstrated that the immune systems of individuals grieving is suppressed and their healthy cells behave more\nsluggishly, resulting in greater susceptibility to illnesses (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). However, the intensity and duration\nof typical grief symptoms do not match those seen in severe grief reactions, and symptoms typically diminish within\n6-10 weeks (Youdin, 2016).\nProlonged and Complicated Grief. After the loss of a loved one,\nhowever, some individuals experience complicated grief, which\nincludes atypical grief reactions (Newson, Boelen, Hek, Hofman,\n& Tiemeier, 2011). Symptoms of complicated grief include:\nFeelings of disbelief, a preoccupation with the dead loved one,\ndistressful memories, feeling unable to move on with one\u2019s life,\nand a yearning for the deceased. Additionally, these symptoms\nmay last six months or longer and mirror those seen in major\ndepressive disorder (Youdin, 2016).\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nFigure 10.27.\nDisorders (5th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 2013),\ndistinguishing between major depressive disorder and\ncomplicated grief requires clinical judgment. The psychologist needs to evaluate the client\u2019s individual history and\ndetermine whether the symptoms are focused entirely on the loss of the loved one and represent the individual\u2019s cultural\nnorms for grieving, which would be appropriate. Those who seek assistance for complicated grief usually have\nexperienced traumatic forms of bereavement, such as unexpected, multiple and violent deaths, or those due to murders\nor suicides (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010).\nAnticipatory Grief. Grief that occurs when a death is expected, and survivors have time to prepare to some extent before\nthe loss is referred to as anticipatory grief. Such anticipation can make adjustment after a loss somewhat easier (K\u00fcbler-\nRoss & Kessler, 2005). Anticipatory grief can include the same denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance\nexperienced in loss one might experience after a death; this can make adjustment after a loss somewhat easier, although\na person may then go through the stages of loss again after the death. A death after a long-term, painful illness may bring\nfamily members a sense of relief that the suffering is over or the exhausting process of caring for someone who is ill is\nover. At the same time, when a person has organized all their waking hours around the care of a dying loved one, upon\ntheir death the caregiver may experience feelings of emptiness and disorientation in addition to relief.\nSurvivor\u2019s guilt (also called survivor\u2019s syndrome) is a mental condition that occurs when a person blames themselves\nfor surviving a traumatic event when others did not. It may be found among survivors of combat, natural disasters,\nepidemics, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations such as among\nthose whose colleagues are laid off.\nDisenfranchised Grief. Social support from others plays an important role in processes of grieving. However, grief that\nis not socially recognized is referred to as disenfranchised grief (Doka, 1989). Examples of disenfranchised grief include\ndeath due to AIDS, the suicide of a loved one, perinatal deaths, abortions, the death of a pet, lover, or ex-spouse,\nand psychological losses, such as divorce or a partner developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Due to the type of loss, there\nis no formal mourning practices or recognition by others that would comfort the grieving individual. Consequently,\nindividuals experiencing disenfranchised grief may suffer intensified symptoms due to the lack of social support (Parkes\n& Prigerson, 2010).\nPatterns of grief. It has been said that intense grief lasts about two years or less, but grief is felt throughout life. One loss\ntriggers the feelings that surround another. People grieve with varied intensity throughout the remainder of their lives.\nIt does not end. But it eventually becomes something that a person has learned to live with. As long as we experience\n416 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement loss, we experience grief. Over time, grief becomes interlaced with gratitude for the presence of the loved one in our\nlives and the cherished memories that remain.\nThere are layers of grief. Initial denial, marked by shock and disbelief in the weeks following a loss may become an\nexpectation that the loved one will walk in the door. And anger directed toward those who could not save our loved\none\u2019s life, may become resentment and bitterness that life did not turn out as we expected. There is no right way to\ngrieve. A bereavement counselor expressed it well by saying that grief touches all of us on the shoulder from time to\ntime throughout life.\nGrief and mixed emotions go hand in hand. A sense of relief is accompanied by regrets, and periods of reminiscing\nabout our loved ones are interspersed with feeling haunted by them in death. Our outward expressions of loss are\nalso sometimes contradictory. We want to move on but at the same time are saddened by going through a loved one\u2019s\npossessions and giving them away. We may no longer feel sexual arousal or we may want sex to feel connected and alive.\nWe need others to befriend us but may get angry at their attempts to console us. These contradictions are normal and\nwe need to allow ourselves and others to grieve in their own time and in their own ways.\nThe \u201cdeath-denying, grief-dismissing world\u201d is often the approach to grief in our modern society. We are asked to grieve\nprivately, quickly, and to medicate our suffering. Employers grant us 3 to 5 days for bereavement, if our loss is that\nof an immediate family member. And such leaves are sometimes limited to no more than one per year. Yet grief takes\nmuch longer and the bereaved are seldom ready to perform well on the job. It becomes a clash between life having to\ncontinue, and the individual being unready for it to do so. One coping mechanism that can help smooth out this conflict\nis called the fading affect bias. Based on a collection of similar findings, the fading affect bias suggests that negative\nevents, such as the death of a loved one, tend to lose their emotional intensity at a faster rate than pleasant events (Walker\net al., 2003). This is believed to help enhance pleasant experiences and avoid the negative emotions associated with\nunpleasant ones, thus helping the individual return to his or her normal daily routines following a loss.\nFactors that Affect Grief and Bereavement\nGrief reactions vary depending on whether a loss\nwas anticipated or unexpected (e.g., parents do not expect to\nlose their children), and whether or not it occurred suddenly or\nafter a long illness, and whether or not the survivor feels\nresponsible for the death. Struggling with the question of\nresponsibility is particularly felt by those who lose a loved one\nto suicide or overdose (Gibbons et al., 2018). These survivors\nmay torment themselves with endless \u201cwhat ifs,\u201d even if they\nknow cognitively that there was nothing more that could have\nbeen done.\nAnd family members may also hold one another responsible for\nFigure 10.29. Bereavement is the term to describe those who\nthe loss. The same may be true for any sudden or\nhave lost a loved one\u2014everyone deals with this is different\nunexpected death, making conflict an added complication to ways, although there are some common threads shared by\nmany who experience this loss.\nthe grieving process. Much of this laying of blame is an effort to\nthink that we have some control over these losses; the\nassumption being that if we do not repeat the same mistakes, we can control what happens in our life and prevent such\nlosses in the future. While grief describes the response to loss, bereavement describes the state of being following the\ndeath of someone.\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 417 As we\u2019ve already learned in terms of attitudes toward death, individuals\u2019 own lifespan developmental stage and cognitive\nlevel can influence their emotional and behavioral reactions to the death of someone they know. But what about the\nimpact of the type of death or age of the deceased or relationship to the deceased upon bereavement?\nDeath of a Child\nDeath of a child can take the form of a loss in infancy such as miscarriage or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS.\nAlternatively, death can take an older child, adolescent, or adult child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost\nunbearably devastating, and the death of a child tends to hold greater risk for negative psychical and psychological\noutcomes than any other loss. This loss also begins a lifelong process: One does not \u201cget over\u201d the death but instead\nmust bear, assimilate, and live with it. Intervention and comforting support can make a big difference to the survival of\na parent in this type of grief but, the risk for negative outcomes is great and may include family breakup, depression,\nor suicide. Feelings of guilt, whether legitimate or not, are pervasive, and the dependent nature of the relationship\npredisposes parents to feelings of responsibility, and hence to a variety of problems as they seek to cope with this great\nloss. Parents who suffer miscarriage or a regretful or coerced abortion may experience resentment towards others who\nexperience successful pregnancies. And seeing other children who are the age that the child would have been had they\nlived can be painful and triggering.\nSuicide and Drug Overdoses\nSuicide rates are growing worldwide and over the last thirty years there has been international research to gather\nknowledge about who is \u201cat-risk\u201d and to find out how to successfully intervene to curb this phenomenon. When a parent\nloses their child through suicide (and suicide is the second leading cause of death during adolescence), it is traumatic,\nsudden, and impacts all those who loved this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves most parents\nfeeling hurt, angry, and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can\u2019t openly discuss their grief and feel\ntheir emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents,\nfamily members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following\nthe loss of a child. They report that \u201ca wall of silence\u201d goes up around them that shapes how people interact with them.\nOne of the best ways to grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find a support group of other parents who have\nsuffered a similar loss, and to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but\nas parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.\nWhen adolescents or other family members die from a drug overdose, the grieving process can also be prolonged and\ncomplicated, with patterns similar to grieving someone who committed suicide. Survivors may experience feelings of\nguilt, anger, resentment, and helplessness; and may not receive the sympathy and social support from others that they\notherwise would. Survivors may worry about the person\u2019s reputation and the value placed on them by society because\nthey committed suicide or died from an accidental overdose, and so may feel defensive, inhibited, or worried about\nsharing their experience of loss.\nDeath of a Spouse\nThe death of a spouse is usually a particularly powerful loss. A spouse often becomes part of the other in unique ways.\nMany widows and widowers describe losing \u201chalf of themselves\u201d and losing their past selves as well. The days, months,\nand years after the loss of a spouse can echo with emptiness, and learning to live without them may be harder than\nthe survivor expects. The grief experience is unique to each person. Sharing and building a life with another human\nbeing, then learning to live alone, can be an adjustment that is more complex than those providing support may realize.\nDepression and loneliness are very common. Feeling bitter and resentful are also normal feelings for the spouse who is\n\u201cleft behind.\u201d Oftentimes, the widow/widower may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new\nlife.\nAfter a long marriage, at older ages, the elderly may find it a very difficult transition to begin anew; but at younger ages\n418 | Death, Dying, & Bereavement as well, the death of a spouse is unexpected and off-time. A marriage relationship is often a profound anchor around\nwhich one\u2019s life is organized, and the loss can completely disrupt the life of the survivor. Furthermore, most couples\nhave a division of \u2018tasks\u2019 or \u2018labor\u2019, (e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc.) which, in addition to\ndealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Immediately after the death of\na spouse, there are tasks that must be completed. Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning\nwas not completed. Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare are just some\nof the issues that can be intimidating to someone who is grieving. If there are children still at home, the survivor must\ntake care of them, support them in their grieving processes, and still find time to take care of themselves as well. Social\nisolation may also become an issue, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity\nof the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. In fact, seeing other\ncouples still together may be intensely painful. Widows in many cultures, for instance, wear black for the rest of their\nlives to signify the loss of their spouse and their ongoing grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been\nreduced to shorter periods of time.\nDeath of a Parent\nWhen an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is considered to be \u201ctimely\u201d and so a normative life course event.\nThis allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in\nan adult\u2019s midlife is not experienced as a simple \u201cnormative life event\u201d by any measure, but instead represents a major\nlife transition that can trigger an evaluation of one\u2019s own life or mortality. Others may shut out friends and family in\nprocessing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship (Marshall, 2004). And the grieving\nprocess can be especially challenging if the parent-child relationship was contentious or difficult, and many issues were\nunresolved.\nDeath of a Sibling\nThe loss of a sibling can be a devastating life event. Despite this, sibling grief is often the most disenfranchised\nor overlooked of the four main forms of grief, especially with regard to adult siblings. Grieving siblings are often referred\nto as the \u2018forgotten mourners\u2019 who are made to feel as if their grief is not as severe as their parents\u2019 grief. However,\nthe sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship since it can last for the lifespan, and siblings who\nhave been part of each other\u2019s lives since birth, such as twins, help form and sustain each other\u2019s identities. With the\ndeath of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor\u2019s identity because \u201cyour identity is based on having them\nthere.\u201d\nThe sibling relationship is a unique one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain\nrole and place in the family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits. Siblings who enjoy a close\nrelationship participate in each other\u2019s daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure\ntime together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often\nlooks toward a future together (even into retirement). Surviving siblings lose this \u201ccompanionship and a future\u201d with\ntheir deceased siblings (White, 2006).\nConclusion\nDeath and dying, like every other developmental task across the lifespan, are biological, psychological, and social\nprocesses. All lifespan perspectives begin at conception and end at death, so textbooks cover from the cradle to the\ngrave, or from \u201csperm to worm\u201d or from \u201cwomb to tomb.\u201d Many philosophers and spiritual guides suggest that you\nshould \u201cLet death be your advisor.\u201d This phase has many meanings, but as Carlos Castaneda explains, \u201cDeath is the only\nwise advisor that we have. Whenever you feel, as you always do, that everything is going wrong and you\u2019re about to be\nannihilated, turn to your death and ask if that is so. Your death will tell you that you\u2019re wrong; that nothing really matters\noutside its touch. Your death will tell you, \u2018I haven\u2019t touched you yet.\u201d Death helps us keep life in perspective, reminds us\nDeath, Dying, & Bereavement | 419 what is really important, encourages us to treasure and make good use of the time we have remaining, and ties us to all\nof living things, past, present, and future.\nSupplemental Materials\n\u2022 In this Ted Talk, Dr. David Williams explains the health outcomes of chronically experiencing racism.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.
