{"text":"Reading and Writing as Processes\nWhile reading and writing well may seem like magic, each is actually a step-\nby-step process that anyone can learn. This section will walk you through the\nsteps and give you some techniques for reading and writing in college that\nhave helped many students much like you.\nWriting Reading\nPlanning to Read\nPlanning to Write\nSurvey\nDrafting\nQuestion\nEditing and Revising\nRead\nProofreading\nRecite\nPublishing\nReview\nPlanning to Read or Write How do I get started reading or writing?\nWriting\nReading\nHow do I get started?\nThe first step in writing is actually not writing at all. Before you can write\nwell, you have to have something to say. So, the first step is to generate ideas\nthat you will incorporate into your writing.\nThere are several strategies that students and professors alike use to help\nthem come up with good ideas. These strategies work well for writing you\ndo as an out-of-class assignment or for in-class writing; you\u2019ll simply spend\nmore time if you\u2019re writing out of class. These strategies are brainstorming,\nfreewriting, and clustering (also known as mapping).\nFor more detailed information on planning your writing, visit the Wikibooks\n- Rhetoric and Composition chapter, \"Planning and Prewriting.\"\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nReading\nBefore you start to read, preview the material. Note the section headings and\nany bold or italicized words. Next, jot down some questions you might have\nabout the reading assignment. If you are reading about the American\nRevolutionary War, you might have the question, \u201cWhat caused the way?\u201d\nNow you are ready to read! Just be sure to be an active reader, someone who\nis truly paying attention to the ideas, not just someone who is looking at the\nwords but not really understanding them. To make sure that you are an active\nreader, picture what is being said. If the material is about a battle, picture the\nbattle and the fighting that occurs; don\u2019t just \u201cthink\u201d the words. That way, you\nshould find the answers to the questions you came up with before reading\nand remember what you have read. After you have read and answered the\nquestions you prepared, go back over the questions and recite the answers. Finally, review the material. You want to make sure that you not only read\nthe material, but that you also understood it!\nLoading ... SQR\nThe SQ3R method is a reading strategy that teaches the reader to: Survey,\nQuestion, Read, Recite, and Review.\nTo learn about this method, you may visit the websites below.\nSQ3R Handout\nhandout provided by the Borough of Manhattan Community College\nThe SQ3R Reading Method\nfrom the Study Guides and Strategies website Brainstorming\nBrainstorming is the planning method most often used for in-class, timed\nwriting, but many students also like it for out-of-class writing as well. When\nyou brainstorm, you look at your topic and start writing down ideas about\nthat topic as soon as they occur to you. You don\u2019t worry about whether the\nideas are good or bad; the point is just to generate ideas to choose from. If\nyou\u2019re writing out of class with no time limit, you might brainstorm for five\nor ten minutes. For timed writing, most students will spend as few as two\nand no more than five minutes.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Clustering\nClustering is particularly useful for writers who like having a visual\nrepresentation of their ideas. In this method, students write their topic in the\ncenter of a piece of paper and draw a circle around it. Then they put related,\nsupporting ideas in a \u201ccluster\u201d around that central topic, drawing circles\naround the ideas and connecting them to the main idea or even each other\nwith lines to show how they are related.\nA simple cluster map of the essay about apples might look something like\nthis:\nMap with running an apple farm center, subtopics Climate (at 12:00),\nTaxes (5:00), and Marketing (7:00)\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Freewriting\nFreewriting is sometimes called the \u201cwet ink\u201d method of planning a piece of\nwriting. In this method, you pick a period of time, often five to ten minutes,\nand you write complete sentences about your topic without pausing \u2013 without\nletting the ink get dry on the page. You don\u2019t go back and make changes or\ncorrections, you don\u2019t worry about the quality of your ideas, and if you run\nout of ideas, you write \u201cI can\u2019t think what to write\u201d until something comes to\nyou. Again, the point is to generate ideas, although sometimes student writers\nfind they can take whole sentences from their freewriting and put them\ndirectly into their papers.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nDrafting Writing the paper\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten into the habit of planning, you may well find that the\nactual writing of the essay is relatively easy. If you have the basic plan laid\nout, you can follow it as you explain your thoughts. You don\u2019t have to follow\nit in exact order, though. If you find it easier to start with one of the body\nparagraphs even though the introduction will ultimately be the first thing a\nreader sees, feel free. You can put everything in order later.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Drafting guidelines\n1Overview of Drafting\n2Drafting: The Process\n3During the Drafting Process\n3.1Let It Flow\n3.2Dealing with Writer's Block\n3.3Experiment\n3.4Meeting the Minimum Word Count\n3.5Title of Your Essay\n4Final Thoughts on Drafting\nhttps:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Drafting\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike\nLicense.; additional terms may apply. Writing outside of class\nWriting on a time limit while you're in class is a special situation, and it's\ndiscussed at length in the chapter on writing in class. If your essay is one that\nyou write as homework, though, your job as a writer is easier. As long as\nyou manage your time well, you don\u2019t have to worry about time limits. You\nmay also be able to write on a computer, which of course makes rearranging\nand editing much easier.\nYou should follow the same steps in the writing process: planning,\ncomposing, revising, editing, and proofreading. One tip that will help you is\nto plan your steps to take place at different times. If you take a break between\nplanning and composing, new and useful ideas may occur to you. If you set\nyour essay aside once you\u2019ve composed it and come back to revising in a\nday or two, you will do a much better job because you\u2019ll be able to see the\nessay more as a reader does. Finally, if you can, set it aside for another day\nbefore proofreading and editing. You\u2019ll find you catch many more mistakes\nthan you would if you tried to proofread right after finishing it.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nEditing and Revising Editing and revising\nRevising, editing, and proofreading are the most important steps in college\nwriting, but they are steps many beginning college writers are tempted to\nskip. Don\u2019t be one of those! Students who don\u2019t revise, edit, or proofread\noften turn in great ideas, but in a form that is hard to understand or that just\nisn\u2019t up to the standard of formal academic work. These steps don\u2019t have to\nbe hard, but they can make a huge difference in what your work says about\nyou and how you are perceived. They can also make a huge difference in\nyour grades!\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Revising\nRevising is the \u201cbig picture\u201d work. Look at what you\u2019ve written to see if it\nall makes sense. Check your logic; have you explained everything clearly\nand shown how it all ties together? Do you have enough details or examples\nto illustrate what you\u2019re trying to say and to make the essay interesting? Does\neach body paragraph really belong in this essay? Is there another paragraph\nthat you really should write and include? Be sure to do these \u201cbig picture\u201d\nchecks before you get into the details of editing and proofreading since any\nbig changes will mean you just have to edit and proofread again.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Editing\nEditing is a stage between revising and looking for typos. At this stage,\ncheck to be sure all your sentences are clear. Also, check the beginning of\neach paragraph and anywhere else that you introduce a new idea and make\nsure that passage flows smoothly from the passage that came before. If not,\nadd a transitional word, phrase, or even sentence to help bridge the gap.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp More on editing and revising Contents\n1 Editing and Revising: One and the Same?\n2 Sentence Structure\n3 Editing Tips\n4 Perspectives on Style\n4.1Richard Lanham on Prose Styles\n5External Links\nFrom Rhetoric and Composition\/Editing\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike\nLicense.; additional terms may apply.\nProofreading Proofreading\nAt the proofreading stage, you are sure that you have all the sentences you\nwant and that they\u2019re in the right place. At this point, you can start cleaning\nup any typos or grammatical errors. If you\u2019re able to work at home or some\nother private place, try reading your work out loud; this helps many writers\nfind mistakes. If you\u2019re working on a computer, print your essay out or\nchange the font so that it looks different; sometimes that helps in spotting\nerrors, too. Finally, try reading the essay \u201cbackward.\u201d Read the last sentence\nfirst, then read the sentence before that, etc. This can help you really focus on\nwhat the sentences actually say. When you read over something you\u2019ve\nwritten in order, sometimes you unconsciously \u201ccorrect\u201d it, seeing what you\nmeant to write instead of what is actually on the paper.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp More on proofreading Contents\n1 Proofreading\n2 Proofreading Basics\n3 Proofreading Tips\n4 Proofreading & Copy Editing Symbols\n5 Ten Steps for Proofreading Your Work\nFrom Rhetoric and Composition\/Proofreading\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike\nLicense.; additional terms may apply.\nPublishing Publishing\n\"Publishing\" does not have to mean that your work will be printed and sold\nin bookstores.

The difference is that the main idea is not a\nsentence that you find in the paragraph or reading selection; it is unstated or\nimplied. You might be asking why a reading selection would not contain a\nstated main idea, but the majority of college textbooks do not contain stated\nmain ideas. The material is presented with enough clues that you can figure\nout the main idea of the text.\nIn order to understand how to find an unstated main idea, let\u2019s review some\nbasic steps. When you are finding a stated main idea or topic sentence, you\nlook for the topic. The topic is a few words (may be even one word) that\nmay be repeated throughout the passage. You find the topic by asking \u201cwho\u201d\nor \u201cwhat\u201d the passage is about. Once you have determined the topic, you\nmove on to asking yourself what the author is saying about the topic. When\nthe main idea or topic sentence is stated, you are looking for a sentence that\ntells what point the author is making; however, when the main idea or topic\nsentence is unstated, you must come up with a sentence that states the\nauthor\u2019s point. Let\u2019s look at an example.\nCarefully I pulled my jacket more tightly around my body. Even the thick\nsweatshirt I was wearing didn\u2019t help. The tip of my nose was cold, and my\nfingers felt too frozen to type. I looked longingly at my portable heater\nbut didn\u2019t want to use it because I was afraid I\u2019d leave it on by accident.\nSighing to myself, I began to type but stopped when I could almost see my\nbreath in the air. \u201cEnough for today,\u201d I said to myself. \u201cI\u2019m headed\nhome.\u201d\nLet\u2019s start with the first question: the topic. Who or what is the paragraph\nabout?\nLook at the word choice. The word \u201ccold\u201d is used once, but what picture is\nthe author painting? If you said that the topic was a cold office, you\u2019d be\nright. There are several clues: warm clothing, cold nose, frozen fingers,\nbreath in the air. Now, let\u2019s ask ourselves the key question: What is the author saying about\nthe cold office? It appears that the author is cold enough that he\/she chooses\nnot to stay long in the cold office, so put that idea into a sentence.\nThe office is too cold for anyone (or the author) to stay very long.\nRemember, main ideas must be expressed in a complete sentence, so a\nfragment will not work when you are constructing the main idea or topic\nsentence. In addition, you need to test your sentence. Is it general enough to\ninclude the points of the paragraph? Main ideas\/topic sentences are general\nsentences as opposed to specific ones. Is it well written? Again, it must be\na complete sentence. Our sentence appears to capture the point the author\nwas making, so we have successfully created a main idea from a paragraph\nwhose main idea was unstated.\nFinding the unstated main idea takes some practice. In your textbooks, you\nwill need to read slowly and carefully in order to fully grasp the author\u2019s\npoint. When you write your essays, you will always state the main idea or\ntopic sentence in your essays, but you need to be aware that your college\ntextbooks will not always have the main idea or topic sentence stated for\nyou. If you don\u2019t see a general sentence that sums up the points of the\nparagraph or reading selection, then you will need to visualize or even write\ndown the main idea because it is unstated.\nAuthor: Dr. Lydia Postell\nEssay Structure Structure overview\nYou can imagine the structure of an essay looking something like the diagram\nbelow.\nAt the top is your introductory paragraph, which starts broad and narrows\ndown over the course of a few sentences to your very specific thesis\nstatement, which is the last sentence in the paragraph.\nThen, the middle or body paragraphs are \"fat\" with lots of specific details in\neach to illustrate your points.\nFinally, the conclusion paragraph at the bottom starts narrowly, with a\nrestatement of your thesis (be sure to word it differently than in the\nintroduction - same idea, different words). Then the paragraph gets broader\nover the next few sentences, where you address the \"so what\" question. What\nis the broader significance of what you've been saying in the essay?\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Preposition Video (20 minutes)\nThesis\/Topic\/Main Idea Main Idea\/ Thesis Statement Main idea\nAuthor: Lydia Postell\nThe main idea, as we call it in reading class, is the same as the topic\nsentence in English class. The main idea, like the topic sentence, simply\nstates what the reading passage is about in one sentence. There are several\nways to find the main idea that you can apply to topic sentences as well.\n1. Find the topic of the selection. In order to find the topic, ask yourself who\nor what the selection is about. When you answer either one of those\nquestions, you will have found the topic. Here are a couple more hints. The\ntopic will often be a word that is repeated throughout the selection. For\ninstance, if you were reading a paragraph about dinosaurs and how they\nbecame extinct, you would see the reason they became extinct repeated\nseveral times throughout the selection, many times using different words.\n2. Another important concept about the topic is that it is always written as a\nfew words or even as one word. Sometimes the title of the selection is the\ntopic.\n3. A third way to look for a main idea is to consider the wording. When you\nsee words that suggest you could find the information by creating a list, then\nyou have found the main idea sentence. Examples of these word groups are\nseveral kinds, three disadvantages of, several reasons for, three causes of,\nand others along these lines. These types of sentences announce the points\nthe reading will deal with.\nA couple of ideas to keep in mind: Main idea sentences take in everything in\nthe reading passage, so when you look for a main idea sentence, be sure to\nlook for the sentence that can take in all the points the paragraph or reading\nmakes. Another important idea to keep in mind is that the main idea, like the\ntopic sentence, may appear in other locations besides the beginning of an\nessay. While it may appear in the first two or three sentences, it may also\nappear in the middle or at the end of a reading selection. Don\u2019t limit\nyourself by looking only at the beginning! Look for the most general\nsentence, and then ask yourself who or what the selection is about. If you are struggling at that point, you might wish to look at the wording of the\nsentences to see if one suggests that a list might be coming. If so, then that is\nyour main idea sentence. Thesis Statement\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nIn writing, a thesis statement is the most important sentence you will write in\nan essay. For this class, and likely for most of your college courses, it should\nbe the last sentence \u2013 or sometimes the last two sentences \u2013 in your\nintroduction paragraph.\nThe thesis statement will say something about your topic, but doesn't just\nstate your topic. For example, you would not want to write\n[Bad thesis]: This is an essay about how everyone should\nown a dog.\nInstead, your thesis statement should say something that is debatable \u2013 that\nis, it should have some attitude. If no one could possibly argue with your\nthesis statement, what would be the point of writing at all? So, let's work on\nthat thesis statement from before:\n[Bad thesis]: This is an essay about how everyone should\nown a dog.\nHow could any reader argue with that? It's your essay \u2013 you know what it's\ngoing to be about. No one reading your essay knows what it's about yet \u2013\notherwise why read it? So, to give it some attitude, let's quit talking about the\nfact that it\u2019s an essay:\n[Decent thesis]: Everyone should own a dog.\nOK. That's better \u2013 that thesis statement has an attitude. But, if I'm reading\nyour essay, I still don't really know where you're going with this, do I?\nThat's where the other part of the thesis statement comes in: the essay map.\nAn essay map gives your reader some idea of what's coming. What would you talk about in trying to convince your friends that everyone should own a\ndog? Those are the topics that you will explain in your body paragraphs, and\nthey are the things you should list in your thesis statement\u2019s essay map.\nHere's an example:\nGood thesis: Everyone should own a dog because dogs\nprovide companionship, provide protection, and provide\ngreat entertainment.\nNow, there is a thesis statement! That one has attitude \u2013 it takes a side on the\ntopic. It also provides a map of where the essay is going. With a thesis\nstatement like this, readers know to expect a body paragraph about\ncompanionship, then one about protection, and then one about entertainment.\nSounds more interesting than just saying \u201cthis essay will be about dogs,\u201d\nhuh? Main Idea - Practice Exercise1\nSelect the stated main idea in the following passages.\nPassage 1\nMany people claim that they do not have time to work exercise into their\ndaily schedules. However, exercise can be easily worked one's daily\nroutine. For instance, one can do stretches while taking a shower. While\nstanding in line at the grocery store, one can flex the abs or clench the rear.\nOne can even do calf raises while talking on the phone. More ideas: try\nwalking around the building during lunch breaks and always take the stairs.\nPassage 2\nMany parents tend to think of day-care centers as breeding grounds for\ncolds. But new research suggests that children in day-care centers appear to\ndevelop immunity to many of the viruses responsible for the common cold.\nAn article published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine\nfound that children ages 6 to 11 who had been enrolled at large day-care\ncenters as toddlers had about one-third as many colds as children who had\nstayed home as toddlers. Dr. Thomas Ball, one of the authors of the study,\nsays that when children have colds as toddlers, their immune systems are\nlearning from these experiences, and this learning will come back to protect\nchildren later in life. Such news should be reassuring to parents whose\npreschool children are in daycare.\nMain Idea - Practice 1 Answer Key Main Idea - Practice Exercise 2\nSelect the stated main idea in the following passages.\nPassage 1\nOne sign of pregnancy is nausea upon awakening. Other signs are increase\nin size and tenderness of the breasts. Still other signs include increase in the\nfrequency of urination and an increase in the size of the abdomen. Thus,\naside from pregnancy tests, a woman can sometimes recognize the early\nsigns and symptoms of pregnancy.\nPassage 2\nIs this year's holiday season making you tired? You can easily perk up by\nfollowing a few easy tips. First, get plenty of rest. Second, snack wisely.\nThird, keep fit. Exercise is very important during the holidays--and not just\nfor its weight benefits. Fourth, take a relaxing bath, and finally try sharing\nwith others.\nPassage 3\nAre you confused by your holiday leftovers? Well, don't save any food that\nhas been sitting around on your dining room table or counters for more than\ntwo hours after cooking. Do place the leftovers in the refrigerator while they\nare still warm. Don't waste those turkey scraps: add them to a salad or\nmake a delicious soup. There are many strategies that you should use when\ndealing with holiday leftovers. You can even pool your leftovers with\nfriends and neighbors by having an after-holiday potluck dinner.\nPassage 4\nYesterday's storm did considerable damage to our neighborhood. Many\nstately oaks were uprooted, and several large old pine trees crushed the\nroofs of at least five houses. The hail that accompanied the storm damaged\nall of the cars that were not under shelter, and my neighbor's home was\ncompletely demolished. And my own \"detached\" garage was certainly detached from its foundation. Clearly, yesterday's storm caused much\ndestruction.\nPassage 5\nSome folks think that pets are trustworthy and harmless creatures. However,\nit's surprising what little thieves these creatures can be. My daughter's ferret\nhas stolen my checkbook, my calculator, my wallet, and my change purse.\nMy officemate's dog stole a neighbor's T-bone steak right off the grill. My\nold dog Moonbear was known to steal freshly baked cherry pies and peanut\nbutter cookies, while the dog that lived below us stole his master's roast one\nday.\nPassage 6\nLara is quite different from her sister Lisa. Lara's hair is jet black and curly,\nwhile Lisa's is blond and straight. Lara stands 5 feet 10 inches in her\nstocking feet, while Lisa is a mere 5 feet 2 inches (in heels!). Furthermore,\nLara's complexion is olive, quite unlike Lisa's rosy hue.\nPassage 7\nMany people are not good listeners. They may not even realize that they lack\nthis skill. But almost anyone can become a better listener by being aware of\ncertain negative listening habits. One such habit is jumping to conclusions\nbefore hearing the entire message. Another bad habit is to nod off when\nsomeone is speaking in a monotone. Turning off to speakers who are not\nnecessarily experts is also a negative listening habit. Yet another bad habit to\navoid is the habit of reacting emotionally to certain words.\nMain Idea - Practice 2 Answer Key Thesis Statement Handout\nThesis Statement Handout\nhandout created by UNC Writing Center\nParagraphs Structuring your essay\nEssays in college may be very long or relatively short. Some will have five\nparagraphs, a structure you may have seen before. Others may have fewer\nparagraphs, and still others may have many more paragraphs.\nAll of your colllege essays, thoguh, will be divided into paragraphs: groups\nof related sentences that develop an idea that is in turn tied back to your main\ntopic. Each paragraph will be presented on your page separately; when you\nstart a new paragraph you will go to a new line, and usually, indent about\nhalf an inch. In some disciplines and some online work, you may skip a line\ninstead of indenting.\nRegardless of the number of paragraphs, all of your essays should have three\nkinds of paragraphs:\nAn introduction paragraph (or paragraphs in very long essays),\nBody paragraphs, and\nA conclusion paragraph\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nParagraph Handout\nhandout from OWL Writing Lab (Purdue University) Introduction\nIn an essay, you\u2019ll first present a broad overview of your topic and the\nposition you take on that topic in an opening paragraph called the\nintroduction. Your thesis statement, usually the last sentence in the paragraph,\nwill state your position. Think of this as your \u201cattitude\u201d toward your topic.\nFor example, if you are writing an essay about apple farming for an\neconomics class, your topic will be apple farms. Your attitude could be\nmany things, depending on your assignment, but perhaps you\u2019ve been asked\nto explain in which areas of the country apple farms are most successful.\nYour thesis statement could be, \u201cAlthough apples can be grown in most of the\nUnited States, the most successful large-scale apple operations are in\nMichigan and Washington State.\u201d In that case, your position, or attitude, is\nthat Michigan and Washington are where the most successful apple farms are\nlocated.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Transitions Body paragraphs\nOnce you have an introduction and a thesis, you will need to support that\nthesis with some examples or evidence. You will do that in the body\nparagraphs that follow the introduction. An essay may have two, three, four,\nor more body paragraphs, but the most common number is three.\nEach body paragraph will develop one point that supports your thesis, and\neach will contain several specific details, examples, or evidence of that\npoint. For example, in your apple essay, in one paragraph you could make the\npoint that the climates in Michigan and Washington State are perfect for\napples. Some of your details could be the average annual temperature in the\ntwo states. You could add that those average temperatures are 44 degrees\nFahrenheit for Michigan and 48 degrees Fahrenheit for Washington, perfect\nfor growing apples.\nYou would also want to add at least one or two more body paragraphs to\nyour essay, each with its own point to make in support of your thesis. In the\napple essay, perhaps one would be about low land taxes in the two states and\nthe other about the ease of getting apples to market there.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Conclusion\nThe final paragraph of your essay is the conclusion. In this paragraph, you\u2019ll\nsum up your main points, and you may restate your thesis. However, you\nshould avoid using the exact same words you used earlier in the paper \u2013 you\nhave to reword, or find a different way to say, those points and that thesis.\nAfter summing up, you should consider what the broader implications of\nwhat you have written may be. Have you (or has your reader) learned\nanything from the essay? Clarified thoughts on a subject? Proven a point?\nDetermined what should be done about a problem? If so, you should indicate\nthis in a sentence or two \u2013 this is the real \u201cconclusion\u201d of your essay.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nExamples\/Supporting Ideas Including Examples and Supporting Details in\nYour Paragraphs\nOne of the most important things you can do to bring your writing to life for\nyour readers is to make sure that you provide plenty of examples or\nsupporting details to explain the big ideas in each of your paragraphs. For\nexample, let's say you wanted to write a paragraph supporting that thesis\nstatement we discussed earlier about owning dogs. Remember, the thesis\nstatement read \"Everyone should own a dog because dogs provide\ncompanionship, provide protection, and provide great entertainment.\"\nLet's work on the first body paragraph, the one about companionship. You\nknow that you want to say that dogs are great companions. But what does that\nmean, exactly? You need to add details to make your point clear. So, take a\nminute and brainstorm some details or examples of ways in which dogs make\ngreat companions. Maybe your list would look like this:\nGreet you when you get home\nWag tails\nLie at your feet when you're sitting around the house\nGo for walks with you\nKeep you company when you're sick\nThat's a good list of some of the ways dogs provide companionship. Now,\nyour job is to pick two or, better, three of the best to write about in that\nparagraph. You want to explain a little bit about each of them.\nSay you think you can write something good about dogs greeting you when\nyou get home. You could add a couple of sub-details to that detail. You could\nsay that dogs wag their tails, jump up and down, and try to lick your hands or\nface when you get home. You could explain that no one other than a dog is\nthat excited to see you every single time you get back, even if you've only\nbeen gone for five minutes.\nPractice What could you add more detail about? Choose one of the other items from\nour list, and jot down a couple of things that you could say about that.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nModes of Organization About the modes of organization\nThe first part of this book is about the stages of the writing process. Now it's\ntime to shift gears and start thinking about the kinds of assignments you're\nlikely to encounter in college. Each \"writing mode\" requires a different mode\nof thinking, and that's why teachers and professors often ask for different\nkinds of writing (they want you to think about a subject in a variety of ways).\nBut generally, assignments will require you to apply several modes,\nsimultaneously, to accomplish a well-rounded body of writing. Few\nprofessors beyond the first-year level of coursework require an assignment\nthat merely focuses on description or narration; other modes are required to\ngenerate a well-rounded piece of writing that entertains, informs, and\npersuades (i.e., narrative, explication, argument).\nMost of the time, you'll find yourself switching among all of these modes as\nyou write. You would have a hard time, for instance, reviewing a car without\nspending any time describing it, and the strength of an argument depends on\nhow well you've evaluated its evidence. What's important is that you\nrecognize the difference between them. Many students lose points each year\nwhen they offer their teacher a description instead of the evaluation or\nargument called for by the assignment. Below, we break down some common\nwriting modes, telling you their characteristics and what makes them unique,\nthen offer examples of informal and formal writing that show them in action.\nFrom Rhetoric and Composition\/Writing Applications\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike\nLicense.; additional terms may apply.

But there are a few major\nerrors to watch out for, errors that indicate some difficulty in forming\nsentences. Here at Dalton State College, those are referred to as Type 1\nerrors, although other schools may have other names for them. This section is\na short introduction to those Type 1 errors; if you have questions, please visit\nthe Writing Lab in the Liberal Arts building (room 315).\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp\nType I\nSentence fragments\nFused or run-on sentences\nSubject-Verb disagreement\nComma Splices A Quick Guide to the Type 1 Errors\nFragments\nA fragment is a group of words that is trying to be a sentence, but that lacks a\nsubject, a verb, or a complete thought.\nBecause Johnny can\u2019t read. (Incorrect. No complete thought \u2013\n\u201cBecause\u201d is the most common subordinating conjunction.)\nThe kids running through the field. (Incorrect. No verb \u2013 remember, -\ning verbs don\u2019t count, and neither do infinitives like \u201cto be\u201d or \u201cto\nrun\u201d).\nAte ten Krystals all at once. (Incorrect. No subject \u2013 who ate those\nKrystals?)\nComma Splices\nThis is when there are two independent clauses (subject, verb, and complete\nthought) with only a comma between them.\nJohn ate ten Krystals, then he threw up. (Incorrect. Both have subject, verb,\nand complete thought, so you need at least a semicolon, not a comma,\nbetween them.)\nRun-on Sentences or Fused Sentences\nJust like a comma splice, except that there\u2019s nothing at all in between the\nindependent clauses.\nDr. Jones must love grammar she writes run-on sentence examples at\nseven in the morning. (Incorrect. This is two clauses with subject,\nverb, and complete thought, just stuck together.) Subject-Verb Agreement Problems\nSubjects and verbs must agree in number. Verbs are \u201cbackwards\u201d\u2014that is,\nverbs have an \u2018s\u2019 on the end when they are singular (remember, nouns have\n\u2018s\u2019 when they are plural).\nOne guy runs. (Correct)\nThree guys run. (Correct)\nThree guys runs. (Incorrect)\nThe trick with subject-verb agreement is to find the subject\u2014what\u2019s doing\nthe \u201cverbing\u201d in the sentence?\nOne guy, as well as his roommates, runs across the dorm parking lot.\n(Correct. The subject is \u201cguy.\u201d The stuff set off by commas and \u201cas well\nas\u201d doesn\u2019t count.)\nOne guy and his roommates run across the parking lot. (Correct. With\n\u201cand,\u201d all of them are running, so all are the subject).\nThere are three apples. (\u201cThere\u201d can be either singular or plural,\ndepending on what it is \u201cpointing to.\u201d In this case, that\u2019s \u201cthree apples,\u201d\na plural subject.)\nThere is one apple. (Correct. \u201cThere\u201d can be either singular or plural,\ndepending on what it is \u201cpointing to.\u201d In this case, that\u2019s \u201cone apple,\u201d a\nsingular subject.)\nWhere is my apple? (Correct.

You\nmay not realize it, but the more words you know, the better your speaking and\nwriting skills will be. College freshmen typically know around 20,000\nwords (need citation). Your goal is to increase this number of words so that\nboth your speaking and reading vocabulary will grow, but what happens\nwhen you come across a word you don\u2019t know?\nContext Clues\nMany times students struggle when they come across a word they have never\nseen. For a long time, students were told to \u201clook it up\u201d when they\nencountered a word they did not know. That is fine if you have access to a\ndictionary, but what if you don\u2019t? What if you are taking a test and don\u2019t\nrecognize the word in a passage?\nContext clues will help you. They are words that appear before, after, or\nclose to a word whose meaning you might not know. All you do is keep\nreading and see if there is a clue to the unknown word\u2019s meaning either\nbefore, after, or close to the unknown word. Here is an example:\nThe gregarious student spent too much time socializing and not enough time\nstudying.\nLet\u2019s say you don\u2019t know the meaning of gregarious. Take a closer look at the\nsentence. What does the gregarious student do? He (or she) likes to socialize\nand talk to others. This type of student is definitely social, so another way to\ndescribe this student is outgoing; therefore, a gregarious student would be\nsomeone who is outgoing and who likes the company of others.\nContext clues typically fall into four categories: synonym, antonym, example,\nand general sense of the sentence. A synonym context clue means that there is a word in the sentence that\ncontains the same meaning as the word you may not know. Take a look at this\nsentence.\nThe math test was arduous; students spent the entire class working on the\ndifficult exam, and many needed extra time just to complete it.\nLooking at the sentence, you\u2019ll notice there is a word that seems to describe\narduous. What word is it?\nIf you said difficult, then you are right. Think about it. If a test requires the\nentire class period and students still need extra time, then that is one difficult\ntest!\nAn antonym context clue means the opposite of what another word means.\nHere is an example:\nThe class completed the easy grammar test in thirty minutes, but the arduous\nmath test took the entire class period.\nHere\u2019s our word arduous again. What word in the sentence means the exact\nopposite? If you said \u201ceasy,\u201d then you would be right, but how do you know\nif the context clue is a synonym or an antonym? Look at the wording in the\nsentence. It contains the word but. This word, like however and yet, shows a\ncontrast, something that is the opposite in meaning. When you see these\nwords used in a sentence, what comes after them will not be the same in\nmeaning as what has come before.\nProbably one of the easiest types of context clues is the example. Sentences\nwith these types of context clues give illustrations of the difficult word. Take\na look at this sentence:\nOur pond is home to amphibious creatures such as frogs and turtles, who\nenjoy swimming in the clear water and then sunning themselves on the rocks.\nIf you don\u2019t know the definition of amphibious, then you might consider what\nfrogs and turtles have in common: they swim in the water and then spend\ntime on the rocks. Therefore, they live on the water and on the land, so amphibious creatures are at home both in water and on land. Sentences with\nexample context clues contain words that let you know an illustration or\nexample is coming: such as and to illustrate are two common wording\npatterns that are used. When you see these, you know an example or\nillustration is in the sentence.\nUsing your general sense of the sentence is also a great help when decoding\nwords. You can look at what the sentence is saying and figure out the\nmeaning of an unknown word. Take a look at the sentence below.\nThe student received an expeditious answer to her email because her\ninstructor was online and answering student questions.\nYou would probably assume that since the instructor was online and\nanswering questions that the answer to the email came quickly. If so, you\nwould be correct.\nLearning to use context clues takes time. It isn\u2019t a skill you will acquire\novernight; however, always stop and think when you come across a word\nyou don\u2019t know. Reread the sentence, and then go back and read a few\nsentence that lead up to the sentence you are studying. If you don\u2019t see a clue,\nkeep reading because the context clue may be after the sentence. Just don\u2019t\ngive up. Study the sentence and the sentences around it until you find a clue\nthat might help you decode the word you don\u2019t understand.\nAuthor: Dr. Lydia Postell\nPractice Games Verb Games\nGrammar Bytes (Subject-Verb Agreement)\nGrammar Gorilla\nFrog Verbs\nTo Bee or not To Bee\nTreasure Hunt\nVerb Power\nEnglish Monstruo\nEnglish Monstruo is a free app (iPad and Android versions available)\ncontaining eight games designed to help students learn verb conjugation.

Inference\nThe information on this side of the page will help in your reading - but it's\nthe same kinds of ideas as in writing! Inference\nInference is sometimes a difficult concept. It means to make \u201can educated\nguess\u201d or \u201creading between the lines\u201d or \u201cdrawing a conclusion\u201d. These\nphrases are used because the information you are seeking is not stated.\nWhen you were in the fourth or fifth grade, you probably answered such\nquestions as \u201cWhat countries border Iraq?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the capital of\nVermont?\u201d Those questions had answers that were stated in the text you had\njust read. Inference, however, requires you to find answers by drawing a\nconclusion from the material you have read. There are clues in the material\nto aid you in finding the answer, but the answer is not directly stated, as it is\nin a literal question. An inferential question in a reading class might be\n\u201cWhat would be a good title for the passage you just read? Here are some\nhints for how you might answer that question.\n1. What is the topic of the passage? Remember, ask yourself who or what\nthe passage is about. You may also look for words that are used more\nthan once and\/or words that describe the same idea, person, or thing.\n2. What is the author saying about the topic? When you can answer what\nthe author is saying about the topic, you will have the implied main\nidea, which should permit you to answer a variety of inference\nquestions because you will know the author\u2019s position on his\/her topic.\nUse these strategies when you are confronted with questions whose answers\nare not stated in the text. The questions may be more difficult to answer, but\nyou can answer them with a little extra thought.\nJust be aware that although most college textbooks use inference to\ncommunicate the main idea in the majority of paragraphs, you do not need to\nuse inference to communicate you main idea in English 0098!\nAuthor: Dr. Lydia Postell\nWriting in Class Writing in class\nIf you\u2019re writing in class, on a time limit, the first thing you should do is\ndecide how much time you should spend on each step in the writing process.\nIf you have an hour, consider spending your time this way:\n5-10 minutes planning,\n30-40 minutes composing, and\n10-25 minutes revising, editing, and proofreading.\nIf you\u2019re allowed to write your essay on loose-leaf paper, try putting each\nparagraph on a separate page. This gives you the option of rearranging the\norder of your paragraphs if you need to. If you must write in a theme book\nand you don\u2019t want to write your introduction first, leave space for it at the\nbeginning.\nIf you can, skip lines as you write. This will allow you to make neat\ncorrections on your first draft. Some students prefer to write out a rough draft\nand then copy it over, and this can work very well. Since you have limited\ntime, however, it\u2019s best to give yourself a \u201cbackup plan\u201d in case you run out\nof time, and skipping lines can help with this.\nAuthor: Jenny Crisp Prewriting Preparing for an Essay Exam (part 1) Preparing for an Essay Exam (part 2)\nEnglish Language Learners Overview chapter\nHelp for English Language Learners\nExplanation from the book Writing for Success\n\u2022 Publisher: Saylor Academy\n\u2022 Year Published: 2012\nCreative Commons License Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) Games\nEnglish Monstruo\nEnglish Monstruo is a free app (iPad and Android versions available)\ncontaining eight games designed to help students practice.

According to WebMd, there are a number of symptoms associated with\nhypothyroidism. One common symptom is the inability to tolerate cold.\nPeople with hypothyroidism feel cold more intensely and often wear\nlight sweaters, even during the summer. Another symptom is feeling\ntired throughout the day. In addition, individuals with this disease often\nexperience hair loss. (Some women find that they never have to shave\ntheir legs again.) Yet another symptom is dry skin. Perhaps most\nproblematic is modest weight gain. People with undiagnosed\nhypothyroid disease often gain weight even when they do not overeat.\n2. Mystery fiction comes in many varieties, each appealing to different\ngroups of readers. First, there is the \"classic\" mystery. Classic\nmysteries include works by Agatha Christie, Edgar Allan Poe, and Sir\nArthur Conan Doyle and allow the reader an equal opportunity to solve\nthe crime. Another category is the hard-boiled variety. Often\nconsidered distinctly American, this variety includes tough, solitary\ndetectives who live in a world gone wrong. Then there are police\nprocedurals. These stories offer a step-by-step look at the personnel\nand methods used in the investigation of a crime and typically include\npolice officers as protagonists. Finally, there is the contemporary cozy,\nwhich is similar to the classical style.\n3. For a novel to be classified as a \"contemporary classic mystery,\" it\nmust include many of the following characteristics. For one thing, there must be a puzzle to be solved by both the reader and the protagonist. In\naddition, the detective, usually a reluctant amateur, is the hero. Next,\nthe investigation of the crime must be the central action or plot of the\nstory. Furthermore, the victim of the crime should be someone who\nwill not be terribly missed. Contemporary classic writers must also\nfollow the rules of fair play. That is, all clues should be accessible to\nthe reader and no new evidence should be included when the villain is\nunmasked.\n4. The 1970s saw a number of changes in the mystery fiction publishing\nworld. One change was the importance of regionalism. Novels need\nnot be set in an English country village or on the mean streets of some\nhuge city. Another change was inclusion. Females were no longer\nexcluded in the world of the private eye. Novels of this time period\nalso saw changes in ethnic and racial representation. For instance,\nJames Patterson introduced the African-American detective Alex Cross,\nand Rabbi David Small and Father Dowling both had crimes to solve.\nIn addition, novels of the 1970s showed increased specialization.\nSeries might focus on horse racing, sports agents, cats, and even antique\nprints.\n5. The writer S. S. Van Dine forbade certain tricks in the writing of\nmystery and detective fiction. First of all, a writer could not use a\nseance to trick the guilty party into confessing. The detective also could\nnot use a word association test to determine guilt. Another forbidden\ntrick was the use of phony fingerprints. Nor could writers have a\ncharacter use a dummy to establish an alibi. Van Dine viewed such\ntricks as violating the rules of fair play.\n6. Father Ronald Knox also offered his own rules for detective fiction. No\nmore than one secret room or secret passageway was allowed. The\ncriminal had to be introduced fairly early in the story. Supernatural forces were also not permitted. Knox also believed that the detective\ncould not be the villain. Perhaps his strangest rule was that no\nChinamen could be featured in a story.\n7. The Dalton State Portal has many useful features. It includes access to\nBANNER. Here students can check their grades or register for\ncourses. The Portal also includes campus announcements. These may\ninform students of new courses or events offered through the Fine Arts\nseries. The Portal's \"bookmark\" feature is particularly useful. With a\nfew simple steps, the user can have access to the Weather Channel, the\nHummingbird Migration Web site, or even the Daily Citizen online.\nMoreover, the Portal offers \"tabs\". These tabs can take interested\nstudents to the Roberts Library Web site or to their DSConnect course\npage. Finally, the Portal offers access to campus email.\n8. According to Research Methods in the Social Sciences (Frankfort-\nNachmias and Nachmias), using personal interviews is often more\nadvantageous than using questionnaires sent through the mail. Personal\ninterviews offer greater flexibility. For instance, during an interview,\nthe interviewer can clarify questions that might be misunderstood. In\naddition, personal interviews typically yield a better response rate.\nResearchers cannot control how many questionnaires are thrown away\nas junk mail, but they can control the numbers of people they eventually\ninterview. Personal interviews also provide fuller information. The\ninterviewer can observe facial expressions and spontaneous reactions\nthat a mailed survey cannot provide.\n9. However, using personal interviews to conduct research is not without\ndisadvantages. The text Research Methods in the Social Sciences\n(Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias) notes that personal interviews are\nmore expensive than mailed questionnaires. For example, travel costs\nto interview a single subject for a study may be far more expensive than the cost of a postage stamp. In addition, personal interviews are\nsubject to interviewer bias. During a face-to-face interview, the\ninterviewer may inadvertently send nonverbal signals to the\ninterviewee that might affect his or her responses. A final drawback of\npersonal interviews is the lack of anonymity. If the subject matter is\nsensitive or controversial, the interviewee could feel too uncomfortable\nto answer truthfully.\n10. American workers change jobs for a variety of reasons. Promotion is\none typically positive reason for changing jobs. Relocating is also a\ncommon reason for a job change. Sometimes workers relocate to help\nout an aging parent; others relocate for health reasons. Layoffs are also\nresponsible for many job changes. Employees who find themselves\nlaid off will often take any job available. And of course, some\nindividuals are forced into a new line of work when they are fired.\nSupporting Details - Practice 1 Answer Key\nReadings Reading Comprehension Test 1\n\"The End of Relationships and Reality\" by Hudson Owens\nReading Comprehension 1\nShort Answer and Multiple Choice\n1.
