Psychology\nUNIT ONE\nPsychology An Overview\nGeneral Objective: At the end of the unit the trainee will\nbe able to describe the introductory\naspects of psychology.\n1.1. Nature of Psychology\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the\ntrainee will be able to describe the\nnature of psychology.\nActivity: Start the lesson by forwarding the\nfollowing brainstorming questions.\nHave you ever read any material or heard anything\nrelated to psychology?\nSpecify the source?\nDid you appreciate?\n\u2666 Psychology originated from two Greek words i.e.,\nPsyche __________ soul\nLogos __________ study\n\u2666 Psychology broke away from philosophy and\nphysiology and emerged as a separate discipline\nsome 100 years ago.\n1 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 since its emergence as a separate science it has\nundergone a series of changes in its research\nmethodology and definition.\nWidely used definition: Psychology is the science of\nhuman and animal behavior.\nWhen explaining the definition underline the main\ncomponents of the definition.\n\u2666 What is science?\n(cid:131) Steps in scientific Study\n(cid:131) Problem identification (example:\nsanitary problems in the family)\n(cid:131) Data collection (family size, age,\ngender, expenditure, access to\npotable water)\n(cid:131) Instruments for data collection\n(observation, interview,\nquestionnaire, case studies, focus\ngroup discussions)\n(cid:131) Organizing the data and\nreporting\n(cid:131) Based on the conclusions arrived\nputting into practice\n\u2666 Behavior is an action, activity or process that\nwe can observe and measure indirectly.\n2 Introduction to Psychology\nExample: to know health practices of a family we can\ninterview members of the family or head of\nthe household by asking different questions.\n1.2 Scope of psychology\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee will\nbe able to state the scope of\npsychology.\nActivity: Start the lesson by asking this question (What is\nthe role of psychology in your future career?)\n\u2666 Compared to other sciences psychology is a young\ndiscipline but it is growing at a faster rate. These\ndays, directly or indirectly, psychology contributes\nsomething to all aspects of human life. Explain the\nfollowing relationships:\n\u25aa Psychology and politics.\n\u25aa Psychology and economics.\n\u25aa Psychology and health.\n1.3 Branches of psychology\nLeading question In Biology the sub fields are zoology,\nbotany, anatomy and physiology. What do you think\nare the sub fields of psychology?\n3 Introduction to Psychology\n1.3.1 Educational psychology\n\u2666 It is about Ways and methods of educating people.\nExample: Which seating arrangement (chairs in\nrows, chairs in small groups, chairs in\na circle) increases participation of\ncommunity members in discussing the\nfollowing community problem. (How can\nwe protect the spring water in the\ncommunity to make it safe and clean?)\nRemind the trainees on the advantages of participatory\nlearning in health education in the acquisition of new\nknowledge and skills.\n1.3.2 Developmental psychology\n\u2666 Deals with aspects of human development\nover the entire span of life.\n\u2666 Span of life covers from conception to death.\n\u2666 Aspects of human development are the\nfollowing:\n\u25aa Physical\n\u25aa Mental\n\u25aa Social\n4 Introduction to Psychology\n1.3.3 Social psychology\n\u2666 It is the study of how people\u2019s thoughts, feelings\nand actions are affected by others.\n\u2666 Social psychologists study aggressive\nbehaviors (example: violence, rape, alcoholism\nin the community)\n\u2666 Social psychologists study conflict between\ngroups, communities, and ethnic groups and\nmethods of solving it.\n1.3.4 Behavioral psychology\n\u2666 It is about the role of environment in\ndeveloping behavior\n\u2666 It is about ways of learning new knowledge\nand skills\nExample: When introducing a new way of thinking in health\nstart from what community members already\nknow and proceed from the known to the\nunknown.\n\u25aa It is about shaping human behavior\nusing rewards.\n\u25aa Toilet training in children\n\u25aa Dietary habit in the family\n\u25aa Sanitation practices in the family\n5 Introduction to Psychology\n1.3.5 Clinical psychology\n\u2666 It is about Psychological disorders and their\ntreatment.\n\u2666 It is about how to change the environment to\nprevent the prevalence of psychological disorders.\nExample: the role a health extension worker plays in\nsensitizing the bad effects of khat, alcohol, and\ntobacco on health and productivity\nNote: indicate that there are traditional ways of healing\npsychological disorders in our society.\n1.3.6 Health psychology\n\u2666 Emphasizes the preventive aspect of health\nthan the curative aspect\n\u2666 Health is not merely the absence of illness.\nHealth is a state of physical, mental and\nsocial well-being .\nExample: Teaching about personal hygiene is not enough.\nBut the family and the society at large must\nparticipate in health programs. Recognizing the\nrole of every member in the community is\nimportant to implement any health program.\nAssignment: ask the trainees to search for other\nbranches of psychology.\n6 Introduction to Psychology\nUNIT TWO\nHuman Development\nGeneral Objective: At the end of the unit trainees will be\nable to describe human development.\n2.1. Introduction to human development\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainees\nwill be able to describe the introductory aspect of human\ndevelopment.\n\u2666 Reflection: Start the lesson by review questions\nfrom their previous experience.\n(cid:131) Which branch of psychology\nstudies development?\n(cid:131) What do you understand by the\nword development?\n(cid:131) Describe a well-developed\npersonality?\n\u2666 Development: It is the sequence of changes over\na full span of life.\n\u25aa development is about how the\nbiological infant turns into the social\nadult.\n7 Introduction to Psychology\n\u25aa development Is regulated by the\ninteraction of hereditary traits with\nenvironmental factors - (D=H X E)\nDevelopment Vs Growth: we use these two terms\ninterchangeably. More often we use growth\nto mean an increase in body size. Average\ngrowth rate during prenatal stage of\ndevelopment is shown below.\nExample\nAt 4 weeks the embryo is\none- fifth of an inch\nAt 8 weeks the embryo is 1 inch\nAt 28 weeks the fetus is 16 inches\nAt 38 weeks the fetus is 20 inches\n\u2666 Development is a more general term indicating changes\nphysically, mentally and socially. It also, explains\npossible causes of changes in all areas.\nPrinciples of development\n1. Development is sequential\nExample: motor development\n\u25aa 2 months an infant raises his head.\n\u25aa 4-7months shows improvement in hand\nand eye coordination.\n8 Introduction to Psychology\n\u25aa 7 months_____ can sit up and stand up holding or\na chair.\n2. Development is irreversible\n\u25aa it is uni-directional\n\u25aa it does not switch back and forth.\n\u25aa Under normal condition we expect mental and\nsocial developments to go with biological development.\n3. Development is progressive change\n\u25aa A lower level leads to a higher one\nExample: In cognitive (mental) development the\nprogress is from sensory knowledge to\nabstract thinking.\nActivity: Form small groups and encourage\ntrainees to explain how the social network\nof the child changes as his/her interaction\nwith his/her environment increases.\nCribs family members\nneighborhood school\n2.2. Stages of human development\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainees\nwill be able to describe the stages of\nhuman development.\n9 Introduction to Psychology\n2. 2.1.Nature or nurture\n\u2666 Brain storming: Before you start explaining the\ntopic pose this question (which factor is\nresponsible in shaping human development;\nheredity or environment?) consider the case of\nidentical twins.\n\u2666 Remind the trainees that nature (heredity) or\nnurture (environment) issue was important even\nin the past.\nExample: in the 1600 the English philosopher John Locke\nconsidered the newborn baby as white paper\n(emphasized the role of nurture)\n\u2666 The French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau\nconsidered hereditary factors as most important\n(emphasized the role of nature)\n\u2666 Developmental psychologists take middle position.\nThey claim that both Heredity and Environment\ninteractively shape human personality. ( D=H x E)\n2.2.2. Stages of development\n\u2666 Infancy\n(cid:131) The infant has a unproportional appearance\n(head is large in proportion to body)\n10 Introduction to Psychology\n(cid:131) Although girls have less muscle tissue and\nweigh less than boys, on the average infants\nare 20 inches tall and weigh seven and half\npounds at birth.\n(cid:131) Behavioral reflexes are present from the\nmoment of birth.\nExample: Infants can react to stimuli such as\ngentle touch or moving light.\n(cid:131) It can extend and flex arms and legs\nwhen touched, smack lips, chew\nfingers, grasp an object.\n(cid:131) During the first year of life motor\ndevelopment (sitting, walking) is\nlargely dependent on biological\nmaturation, even though, practice\ncan speed up the whole process.\n\u25aa Sensory motor coordination\n\u2022 during 1 month can\nstare at an attractive object\n\u2022 during 2 and half months swipe at an\nobject\n\u2022 during 4-months raise\nhands to catch the object\n11 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 during 5 months reach\nand grasp the object\n\u2666 Childhood (preschool children)\n(cid:131) Development is rapid in all areas (physically,\ncognitive, and socially) during this stage\n(cid:131) Rate of growth is slower at this stage than\ninfancy.\n(cid:131) There are changes in body proportion.\nExample: \u25aa head growth is slow\n\u2022 Trunk growth is rapid\nLimb growth is rapid\n\u2022 Matured body proportion, increased strength\ncoordination and developed nervous system\nprovide foundation for increased psychomotor\nskills.\n\u2022 At age 6 children achieve sufficient eye and\nhand coordination, timing, and fine muscle\ncontrol to demonstrate any skill in this activity.\n\u2022 The child develops language skills and enters\nthe world of knowledge and culture by asking\nthe why question.\n\u2022 Vocabulary increases rapidly between 2 and 6\nyears of age.\n12 Introduction to Psychology\n\u25aa Each day on average, five to eight words, are\nadded to the child\u2019s vocabulary.\nQuestion:- (why do we send children to school at the\nage of seven?)\n\u2666 Childhood (middle childhood 6 (7) - 12 years)\n\u2022 Physical growth begins to slow down.\n\u2022 A adolescent growth spurt begins at the age of\n10 and 12 for girls and boys respectively.\n\u2022 Muscle tissue increases and they grow\nstronger.\n\u2022 Motor development tends to be smooth accurate\nand well coordinated.\n\u2666 Adolescence (18-25)\n\u2022 It is a period between childhood and adulthood\n\u2022 Puberty is a biological event in which hormonal\nchanges promote rapid physical growth and\nsexual maturity in both sexes. It is marked by\nmenarche (the first menstrual cycle in girls) and\nNocturnal emission (sperm ejaculation) in boys.\nPuberty is not a period by itself. It is a gate way\nto adolescence.\n13 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Adolescents become sexually active, delinquent,\nbe involved in drug and alcohol abuse, suicide,\nrisk taking. At this stage they are also exposed\nto sexually (STD) transmitted diseases and\nschool failure. Family and school guidance are\nvery essential and helpful for adolescents to\ncope up with challenges of this period.\n\u2022 Early maturation of boys may enhance self-\nimage, which is an advantage socially and\nathletically. For girls early maturation may result\nin early sex which is a risk factor.\n\u2666 Adulthood (20-60 years)\n\u2022 It is a developmental stage in which\ntypical life goals and concerns are taking\nshape.\n\u2022 Typical life goals during adulthood are\nrelated to\n\u2022 Education and family\n\u2022 Children\u2019s lives and personal property\n\u2022 Good health, retirement, leisure and the\ncommunity.\n\u2022 Typical concerns during adulthood are\nrelated to\n14 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Relationship with friends\n\u2022 Occupational worries\n\u2022 Health fears\nNOTE: Social and personality development for all stages of\ndevelopment are discussed under unit five.\n2.3. Theories of development\n2.3.1. Cognitive theory of development General\n\u2022 The term cognitive came from the Latin word\ncognosco which means to know.\n\u2022 Cognition refers to acquisition, processing,\norganizing and the use of knowledge.\n\u2022 Jean Piaget developed the cognitive theory of\ndevelopment.\nDevelopmental stages\n\u2666 Stage one: sensory motor stage (from birth up to two\nyears)\n\u2022 A child\u2019s experience is based on an immediate\nperception of physical objects.\n\u2022 Thinking is dominated by the here and now.\n15 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 For the child out of sight is out of mind (example:\nhide his toy under the blanket for the child the toy is\nnon existent)\nReason: language and memory are not developed.\n\u2666 Stage two: preoperational stage (two to seven years)\n\u2022 With developed language the child is now\ncapable of thinking in the absence of the object.\n\u2022 Now the child sees the world only from his own\npoint of view (example: The child says that\nother people see me if I see them)\n\u2022 The Child\u2019s thought is also centered on only one\nfeature of a situation.\nExample: For a child at the preoperational stage sausage\nshaped bread is bigger than a ball shaped\nbread even though both are equal in their size.\n\u2666 Stage three: Concrete operational stage (7 \u2013 11 years)\n\u2022 The child has the ability to think reversibly. He\ncan easily understand that a sausage shape can\nbe changed into round shape and back to\nsausage shape without necessarily seeing the\nobject.\n\u2022 The child has also the ability to see more than\none feature of an object. He can see for example\nthe height, width and length of an object.\n16 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 Stage four: Formal operational stage (11 years onwards)\n\u25aa The ability to reason out abstractly without\nconcrete objects or events starts.\n\u25aa It is a form of adult thinking. This helps the\nchild to learn science and mathematics\nand other subjects set in the curriculum\nmaterial.\nImplications:\n\u2022 The health extension worker and parents\nshould be aware of to the Child\u2019s level of\ndevelopment.\n\u2022 Active participation and interaction with the\nenvironment is important.\n\u2022 Encouraging children to ask questions on\nseveral topics and encouraging them to\nexplore their environment develops their\ncognitive (mental) capacity.\n2.3.2. Psychoanalytic theory of development\nGeneral\n\u2022 Sigmund Freud is the founder of the\npsychoanalytic theory of development\n(1856-1939)\n17 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Children pass through a series of\ndevelopmental stages.\n\u2022 Failure in to resolve problems at a particular\nstage results in halting in development. In\npsychoanalysis this is called fixation.\n\u2022 Fixation at a particular stage may result in\nadult emotional problems.\n\u2666 Oral stage (from birth to one year)\n\u2022 Activity is centered to the mouth and the child\ngains satisfaction from sucking.\n\u2022 Fixation may be caused by:\n\u2022 Over feeding, sometimes\nunprogrammed feeding\n\u2022 Frustration of the Child\u2019s\nbiological needs.\n\u2666 Possible adult life characteristics are\n\u25aa Addictions (smoking, alcoholism)\n\u25aa Nail biting.\nNote: Emphasize the importance of breast-feeding for\nphysical and emotional development of the child.\n18 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 Anal stage (second year of life)\n\u25aaThe child exercises withholding and expelling of\nfeces.\n\u25aa Important event at this stage is toilet training.\nFixation may occur due to conflict between\nthe child\u2019s need and adults\u2019 restrictions\nduring toilet training. Some parents are\nextremely strict and others are reluctant in\nthe training process.\n\u2666 Possible adult life problems are excessive cleanliness\nand orderliness.\nReflection: encourage trainees to reflect toilet training\npractices and their implications in our society.\n\u2666 Phallic stage (three to six years)\n\u25aa Day dreaming for sexual intimacy with parents of\nopposite sex.\n\u25aa Through the socialization process, however, boys\nand girls understand and change in their belief\nsystem that this is forbidden wish.\n\u25aa To avoid the sense of being guilty, they identify\nthemselves with parents of the same sex (how?)\n(cid:131) By adopting gender roles in the\nsociety.\n19 Introduction to Psychology\n(cid:131) By adopting moral norms in the\nsociety.\n\u2666 Latency period (6 years to puberty)\n\u25aa It is relatively a calm period.\n\u25aa It is the time to learn basic social and\nintellectual skills.\n\u2666 Genital stage (puberty)\nReflection: Ask trainees to reflect on the landmarks\nof the onset of puberty.\n\u2022 Hormonal changes due to biological maturity are\nimportant developments during this stage.\n\u2022 Interest in sexual maturity begins.\n\u2022 Adult\u2019s sexual attitudes and feelings\nbegin to develop.\n20 Introduction to Psychology\nUNIT THREE\nLearning\nGeneral Objective: At the end of the unit the trainee will\nbe able to describe learning.\n3.1. The nature of learning\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee\nwill be able to describe the nature of\nlearning.\nBrain storming: Start the lesson by encouraging trainees\nto give their own definitions of learning\n\u2666 Learning is a relatively permanent change of behavior\ndue to training and/ or experience.\n\u2666 Main components of the above definition are:\n\u25aa Learners involve in the learning process.\n\u25aa Learners are engaged in activities.\n\u2666 In learning less emphasis is given to information\ntransmission and greater emphasis is given to skill\ndevelopment and attitudinal change.\n\u2666 Basic components of learning: briefly learning is a\nfunction of:\n21 Introduction to Psychology\nL= S R C\nWhere\nL = Learning\nS = Stimulus\nR = Response\nC =Consequence (some kind of reward or punishment)\n\u2666Drive\n\u25aa The degree of desire to learn\n\u25aa Expectation of the learner from the instructional process\n\u2666 Stimulus\n\u2022 A stimulus is any form of energy from the\nenvironment to which a person is capable of\nreacting.\n\u2022 When the learner is activated by a stimulus learning\ntakes place.\n\u2022 In the learning process the learner should be\nprovided with adequate stimuli.\nExample: guidelines, principles, and steps.\n\u2666 Response involves\n\u2022 Reaction to environmental stimuli.\n\u2022 Learning is not a spectator sport.\n22 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 Response of the learners includes:\n\u2022 Discussing about what they listen.\n\u2022 Relating to past experience.\n\u2022 Applying it to their daily activities.\nNB. Tell me and I will listen. Show me and I will understand.\nInvolve me and I will learn.\n\u2666 Reinforcement\nIt is the process of increasing the probability of a specific\nresponse. Reinforcement increases the association\nbetween a stimulus and its response. For example, good\ncommunication and establishment of common\nunderstanding with the community can increase the\ncooperation of the community. Provision of maternal and\nchild services encourages and reinforces mothers to seek\nthe services and increases utilization. Reinforcers are of\ntwo kinds.\n\u25aa Primary reinforcers satisfy some kind of biological\nneeds.\nExample: food, warmth, and cessation of pain.\n\u25aa Secondary reinforcers work when they are associated\nwith primary reinforces\nExample: Money.\n23 Introduction to Psychology\nIt becomes a reinforcer when we use it to improve life\ncondition in the family.\n3.2. Theories of learning\nSpecific objectives: At the end of the lesson the trainees\nwill be able to describe the theories\nof learning.\n3.2.1.Classical conditioning theory\n\u2022 Ivan Pavlov Russian physiologist and\npsychologist and Nobel Prize winner in 1904\ndeveloped the theory.\n\u2022 Pavlov found that the mouth secretes saliva\nwhen food is merely seen or smelled.\n\u2022 Classical conditioning is a basic form of\nlearning in which a neutral stimulus results in an\ninvoluntary action.\n\u2666 The basic steps in classical conditioning experiment are:\nA. Before conditioning Response\n(Neutral stimulus) Pricking of the ear\nSound of a bell\n24 Introduction to Psychology\nB. During conditioning Unconditioned response\nConditioned Stimulus (SALIVA)\nSound of a bell (CS) (UCR)\n+\nMeat (unconditioned stimulus UCS)\nC. After conditioning Conditioned response\n(CS) alone (CR) saliva\n\u2666 Unconditioned stimulus (ucs) in this case meat leads to\nunconditioned response(ucr) which is secretion of saliva.\n\u2666 Secretion of saliva (UCR) to a piece of meat (UCS) is\nnatural. It is not learned. It is inborn.\n\u2666 During conditioning or training the sound of the bell which\nis the conditioned stimulus (CS) is transformed into\nconditioned response (CR) saliva.\n\u2666 UCR and CR are similar. In both cases it is secretion of\nsaliva. But the CR is learned. It is the result of training or\nconditioning\n\u2666 Some features of classical conditioning\n\u25aa Extinction: when the sound of the bell is\npresented repeatedly without the meat, the dog\n25 Introduction to Psychology\nstops secreting saliva. The relationship between\nthe two stimuli becomes loose. We call this\nprocess extinction. Extinction is a form of\nforgetting.\n\u25aaSpontaneous recovery: when the dog\nrestarts to secrete saliva after extinction.\nExample: If a khat addicted person after receiving\ntreatment is continuously exposed to khat,\nhe may suddenly relapse in to khat\nchewing.\n\u25aaStimulus generalization: It is giving the\nsame response to similar stimuli. It\nmay or may not be appropriate.\nExample: If a student has learned that virus and\nbacteria cause infectious diseases and uses\nthese two words as if they are similar, he\nmade inappropriate generalization.\n3.2.2. Operant conditioning theory\n\u2022 B.F. Skinner an American psychologist developed\nthe theory.\n\u2022 Laboratory animals learn to press the lever in order\nto obtain food.\n26 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Reinforcement is an important aspect of operant\nconditioning.\n\u2022 When teaching the community about health related\ntopics, it is essential to engage the learners in some\nrelevant activity directly related to the task at hand.\nExample: When community members bring some kind of\nbehavioral changes with respect to health within\nthe families and within the community, it is\nessential to reward (material or moral) them.\n3.3. Dynamic components of learning\n3.3.1.Motives of learning\n\u2666They are interests or drive, which cause a\nperson to behave in a certain way.\nExample: motive of getting scientific knowledge about\nthe preventive aspect of health.\n\u2666 Motives of learning occur when:\n\u2022 A student is inspired to work hard.\n\u2022 When the trainer makes learning interesting\nand easier to learn.\n\u2022 When learning is relevant to the extension\nworkers future career.\n27 Introduction to Psychology\n3.3.2 Attitudes of learning\n\u2666 Attitudes: It is a tendency to behave or think in a\ncertain way. For example, one health worker may\nrefuse to see patients when the health center is\nclosed. Another may be willing to see patients at any\ntime. This is because they have different attitudes to\ntheir job.\n\u2666 Attitudes are formed or changed during training.\n\u2666 Like knowledge and skills attitudes are not easy to\nmeasure.\nExample: Teaching Health workers how to inject a patient\nis a skill. Explaining to health workers about\nthe importance of respecting the opinion of\npatients is trying to change the attitudes of\nhealth workers. But it is difficult to find out\nwhether the health worker\u2019s attitudes have\nchanged or not. Measuring attitude is more\ndifficult than measuring skill and knowledge.\n\u2666 General methods to shape attitudes.\n(cid:131) Providing information\nExample: the relationship between smoking of cancer and\nheart diseases.\n28 Introduction to Psychology\nExercise: What facts are you going to mention to the\ncommunity if you want to persuade a mother to\nhave a positive attitude towards breast-feeding?\n(cid:131) Providing positive models (setting\nideal persons or examples in the\nsociety, teachers, nurses, doctors,\nother health extension workers)\n(cid:131) Providing experience to shape\nattitudes (direct experience, for\nexample, seeing health sufferings of\nthe community will have more input\non shaping students attitudes).\nExample: students may grow vegetables in their training\ncompound and experience its nutritional value\nin the community.\n\u2022 Students should practically see the\nbenefits of an uncontaminated water\nsupply in a village\nExercise: Ask your students to list three experiences that\nwould help them to form good attitudes to\nclients.\n\u2022 Conduct discussion in small groups\nto shape attitudes of student.\n29 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Discuss the experiences that they\nhave had with clients.\n\u2022 Let some students say their opinions\nand see the reaction of other\nstudents.\n\u25aa Sample questions for discussions\n\u2022 How would you start to persuade the\nlocal people about the importance of\npiped water supplies?\n\u2022 What objections could come from the\ncommunity?\n\u2022 How would you respond to these\nobjections of the community?\n3.3.3 Interest\n\u2666 Interest means what an individual likes or dislikes or\nprefers to engage in a particular type of work\nrather than another one.\n\u2666 Interest can be intrinsic or extrinsic.\n\u2022 extrinsic interest is related to activities which\nwould rise satisfaction and pleasure\n(example Learning to get better salary)\n30 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Intrinsic interest is an internal satisfaction\nthat one gains by simply doing or performing\nan activity .\n\u2022 The health extension worker may be\nintrinsically interested to solve health\nproblems of the community.\nIndividuals in the course of their development acquire\ninterests. It would be easier for the teacher to arouse\nthe interest of the traineeships for the desired result of\nlearning. During the training period it is essential to\ndevelop interest in trainees about their future career.\n31 Introduction to Psychology\nUNIT FOUR\nMemories And Forgetting\nGenera Objective: At the end the unit the trainee will be\nable to describe memory and forgetting\nSpecific Objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee\nwill be able describe the stages of memory.\n4.1. Introduction to memory\n\u2666 Memory is the power of retaining what one has\nlearned and the power of retrieving it at will for\nfuture use.\n\u2666 Memory is not a thing but a process.\n\u2666 Memory and learning go together.\n\u2666 You cannot really learn if you are unable to\nremember what you have learned. Also unless\nyou acquire new knowledge you have nothing to\nstore and nothing to memorize.\n4.1.1. Stages of memory\nThere are three stages of memory. These are:\n32 Introduction to Psychology\n1. Sensory memory\n\u2022 it is initial and momentary storage of\ninformation.\n\u2022 Information coming from the\nenvironment reaches the brain through\nthe sensory nerves.\n\u2022 In the brain it is registered as sound,\nlight, or any other stimuli.\n\u2022 Information in the sensory memory\nlasts about one second.\nExample: flash of light\n2. Short term memory\n\u2022 Information first gets meaning in the\nshort term memory.\n\u2022 In the short term memory information\nlasts about fifteen to twenty-five\nseconds.\nExample: asking someone a telephone number\nand after calling, the information (the number) is\nlost from memory.\n33 Introduction to Psychology\n3. Long term memory.\n\u2022 It is the process of placing (encoding)\ninformation in the memory.\n\u2022 When we need the information, we can\neasily recall it and use it.\nHow to recall information from the long term memory\n\u2022 By expanding the already existing information\n\u2022 By meaningful repetition\n\u25aaThe human long term memory has\nunlimited capacity to restore and retrieve\ninformation.\nNB. Adults learn best about health extension packages\nwhen learning experiences are related to life(for further\nreading see pedagogy of the oppressed by Paulo ferrire)\n4. 2. Theories of forgetting\n\u2666 Decay theory\n\u2022 It is the earliest theory of memory\n\u2022 At early stage memory is sharp and clear but\nfades or decays with the passage of time. (it is\nlike a photograph left in the sun)\n34 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Time and presentation of the material are\ncontributing factors of forgetting. (faster\npresentation lesser time)\nnoitamrofnI\nfo deniateR\negatnecreP\negarevA\nTime\nFigure 1: The forgetting curve\ninterference theory\n\u25aa When one task interferes in the performance of\nanother task then forgetting takes place.\nInterference can happen in two ways.\n35 Introduction to Psychology\n1. Retroactive interference\n\u2022 it takes place when later learning interferes with\nthe recall of prior learning.\nExample: task one- student learns the anatomical structure\nof the heart.\nTask two-student learns the functions of the heart.\n\u2022 The student confuses some of the functions of\nthe heart with anatomical structures of the\nheart.\n2. Proactive interference\n\u2022 When prior learning interferes with later learning\nwe call it proactive interference.\nExample: task one- student memorizes names of certain\nspecies.\nTask-two student memorizes names of another set\nof species.\n\u2022 Information from task one interferes when the\nstudent wants to recall facts from task two.\n\u2666 Consolidation theory\n\u2022 It is the degree to which a new material is\nremembered.\n\u2022 It is processing information in depth.\n36 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 To consolidate information, use cues\n\u2022 Processing information in terms of physical\naspect (learning by doing, using demonstration\nwhen teaching new skills)\n\u2022 By associating new knowledge with past\nexperience\n\u2666 Motivated forgetting theory\n\u25aa It is repressing or pushing unacceptable\nthoughts and feelings into the unconscious part\nof the mind so as to avoid confronting them\ndirectly.\n\u25aa It is deliberate forgetting.\n\u25aa Repressive forgetting is common among people\nwho have committed crimes.\nExample: rape (the victim as well as the rapist attempt to\nrepress the thought into the unconscious part of\nthe mind). They don\u2019t want to remember the\nsituation.\n4.3. Motivation in learning\n\u2666 The role of motivation\nExpectation and knowing the benefits of the goal will\ninfluence us to behave in a certain manner.\n37 Introduction to Psychology\nExample: The degree to which the trainee is motivated to\nstudy hard to complete the training program\ndepends upon his expectation how much\ncompleting the training will pay off.\n\u2022 In terms of good grade\n\u2022 and the value the trainee places on getting\ngood grade.\n\u2022 If both expectations and benefits are high\nthe trainee will be motivated to study hard.\n\u2022 If expectations or benefits are low the\ntrainees motivation to study will be\nrelatively low.\nActivity: Let the trainees list down their expectations from\nthe training program in the Training Center.\nLet them explain the value they attach to the\nfulfillment of their expectations.\n\u2022 Cues: I expect to gain basic knowledge and\nunderstanding on health problems of Ethiopia\nduring my stay in the college (expectation)\n\u2022 The knowledge and skills I get from the training will\nenable me to contribute something to alleviate the\nhealth problem in my country.\n38 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 Use of mnemonics\n\u2022 The word mnemonics originated from the Greek\nword mneme which means \u201cmemory.\u201d\n\u2022 Mnemonics are strategies to organize and\nremember given information.\n\u2022 By using mnemonics we can improve our retention\nof information.\n\u2022 The method of loci for example involves associating\ninformation to remember with a series of places that\nare firmly fixed in our memory.\nExample: digestive systems\nMouth__________ the gate of your house\nEsophagus_______ the corridor in the waiting\nroom\nStomach________ the dinning table (similarly\nyou can relate the rest of the digestive system with\nsections of your rooms.\n\u25aa When we learn the rhyme thirty days have\nSeptember, April, June, and November all the\nrest have \u2026.) We use mnemonics.\n39 Introduction to Psychology\nUNIT FIVE\nPersonality\nGeneral Objective: At the end of the unit the trainee will\nbe able to describe personality.\n5.1. Theories of personality\nSpecific Objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee\nwill be able to describe theories of\npersonality.\nDefinition: The word personality originated from the Latin\nword persona meaning person. In classical\nRoman literature, it was a mask which an actor\nwore to play his role. The word persona was used\nto indicate the actor in the mask. The layman may\nequate personality to popularity or good clothing.\nScientific definition of personality: The difference among\npeople plus the stability of any individual\u2019s\nbehavior over long periods.\n\u25aa Personality is dynamic. It develops out of the\nconstant interaction between man and\nenvironment.\n40 Introduction to Psychology\nACTIVITY\nMAN\nENVIRONMENT\n5.1.1 Psychoanalytic theory\n\u2666 Sigmund Freud was the founder\nof the theory.\n\u2666 It is the most profound theory of\npersonality.\n\u2666 Basic ideas of the theory\n\u25aa Forces contained within us, which we are not\naware of trigger our behavior.\n\u25aa These hidden forces, shaped and consolidated by\nchildhood experiences, play an important role in\ndirecting our behavior.\n\u25aa Freud termed this process the Unconscious.\nNote: Underline that childhood is a critical period for the\nformation of later adulthood personality.\nAccording to Freud the human personality consists of three\nstructures. These are:\n1. The Id\n41 Introduction to Psychology\n\u25aa It is inborn.\n\u25aa It is governed by the pleasure principle.\n\u25aa its main goal is to reduce tensions created by\nprimitive drives and get maximum\nsatisfaction of the biological needs.\n(Example: hunger, sex)\n2. The ego\n\u25aa It is executive of personality. All decision making\nprocesses of the personality are done by the ego.\n\u2022 It Makes decision.\n\u2022 It Controls action.\n\u2022 It allows thinking and problem solving\napproach when the personality faces\nproblems.\n3. The super ego\n\u2022 It helps to integrate broad moral values of society.\nThese broad moral values are learned through the\nsocialization process in the family, religious\ninstitutions and from the community at large.\nThrough the socialization process we learn all the\ndos and don\u2019ts.\n\u2022 It prevents us from doing immoral things.\n42 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 The super ego motivates us to do what are morally\naccepted things by the society.\nRemark. The three personality structures interact in actual\nlife situation. The ego is mediator and helps the personality\nto adjust to its environment. It tries to bring together\nopposing tendencies of the id and the superego and\nenables the personality to adjust to the environment. See\nthe following example.\nBereket, a seven year old boy spot a candy in the\nsupermarket. He wanted to posses the candy. His\nbiological id pushed him to get the candy as soon as\npossible. The super ego tells him that stealing is forbidden.\nHis ego tells him that it is wise and appropriate to ask his\nfather to buy him the candy.\nActivity: form small groups and help your students to\ndiscuss the problem of HIV/AIDS and how\nthe three personality structures work together\nto bring behavioral change to reduce and\ncontrol the epidemic.\n43 Introduction to Psychology\n5.1.2. Trait theory\n\u2022 A trait is a way in which one\nindividual differs from another. They\nare modes of behavior and are\nrelatively stable for a long period of\ntime.\nExample: extraversion.\n\u25aa It is a personality trait. People with\nextraversion personality are characterized by:\n\u25aa Active and interactive in social gatherings\n\u25aa Gregarious and sociable\n\u25aa Easily excited by things\nIntroversion.\n\u25aaIt is another form of personality trait.\n\u25aapeople with introvert personality are characterized by:\n\u2022 they are Passive\n\u2022 they are Quiet and in most cases\nspend their time lonely.\n\u2022 they are cautious very careful when\ndoing things.\n\u2022 they are reserved and they do not interact\neasily with other people.\n44 Introduction to Psychology\nActivity: Divide your students into small groups and ask\nthem to list down words or adjectives that\ndescribe human personality in our society and\nhow these personality traits affect a person\u2019s life.\n5.1.3. Humanistic theory\n\u2666 Each individual has a unique potential.\n\u2666 Self esteem (having positive or negative regard for\noneself) is important in shaping ones personality. Over\nestimating and under estimating ones own capabilities\nmay result in social and psychological problems like\nsuperiority and inferiority complexes.\n\u2666 Individual needs (need for recognition) have an effect on\nones personality.\nNB: Remind your students that it is very important to\naccept, recognize and appreciate the personality of\ncommunity members, elders and religious leaders\nbefore introducing any health related package in the\ncommunity. In a community there are resourceful\npersons having varieties of potential. Hence it is\nadvisable for the health extension worker to utilize this\npotential wisely.\n45 Introduction to Psychology\n5.2. Social and personality development\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the\ntrainee will be able to describe social and personality\ndevelopment.\n5.2.1. Social and personality development in infancy\n(birth \u20131 \u00bd years)\n\u2666 Consistently meeting the physical and social needs of the\nnewborn baby (when cold, wet, hungry, affection) is very\nimportant for healthy social and personality development.\n\u2666 Positive interaction and attachment with caregivers\ndevelops trust and self-confidence.\n\u2666 Eye to eye interaction between an infant and care givers\n(mother, father or any other adult person) is important for\nemotional development\n5.2.2. Social and personality development in childhood\n\u2666 From 1 \u00bd- 3 years\n\u25aa It is time to explore the environment.\n\u25aa If children are restricted and controlled they are\nunable to develop self-control.\n\u25aa Too little control may result in an over\ndemanding behavior\n\u2666 From 3- 6 years\n\u25aa Children start to plan and set goals, act\nindependently.\n46 Introduction to Psychology\n\u25aa Adults should react positively to the Child's\nattempts.\nHow can the child be protected from failure and other\nunwanted consequences in his activity?\n\u2022 By easing autonomy (not to be authoritative)\n\u2022 Permitting children to participate in decision-\nmaking at home.\n\u2022 Encouraging children not to give up their plans.\n\u2666 From 6-12 years\n\u2022 The child shows competency in all areas.\n\u2022 Social interaction widens (influence of peer\ngroups is great)\n\u2022 Academic skills develop.\n\u2022 Enters into the wider culture\n5.2.3. Social and personality development in adolescent\n(18-25 years)\n\u2666 The adolescent raises the identity question (who am I?)\n\u2666 Pressure due to:\n\u2022 Physical change (primary and secondary\nsex characters develop)\n47 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Societal expectation changes (they\nconsider themselves as adults, yet\nthey are dependent on their parents)\n\u2666 To avoid confusion appropriate role model formation\nis important.\n5.2.4. Social and personality development in adult hood.\n\u2666Formation of close relationship with others.\n\u2666Relationship could be on physical, intellectual or\nemotional level.\nExample: marriage, becoming member of professional\nassociations.\n\u2666 Contribution to the family, community and his country\nbecomes great during this period.\nNOTE: Remind the trainees that the responsibility of the\nhealth extension worker is multi-dimensional. In\naddition to promoting the preventive aspect and\nhealth in the communities health extension workers\nare also social agents. They have responsibility to\neducate the community on child rearing practices\nand sensitizing the community on problems of\nadolescents and gender issues.\n48 Introduction to Psychology\nUNIT SIX\nMotivation And Emotion\nGeneral Objective: At the end of the unit the trainee will\nbe able to describe motivation and\nemotion.\n6.1 Theories of motivation.\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee\nwill be able to describe the principles\nof motivation.\nDefinition of motivation. It is the process, which gives\nimpetus to behavior by arousing\nsustaining and directing it toward the\nattainment of goals.\n\u2666 instinct theory\n\u25aa An instinct is an inborn force found in all members\nof a species.\n\u25aa It directs behavior in a fixed manner without\nsignificant change in that species.\n\u25aa The behavior of lower animals is largely instinctual.\n\u25aa It is built in genetically.\n\u25aa In human beings also there are instinct behaviors.\n49 Introduction to Psychology\nExample: Curiosity, reproduction and repulsion (babies\nhave built-in tendency to become attached to\nadults who care for them)\n\u25aa Compared to lower animals human instincts are\nless rigid and vary due to learning.\nAssignment: List down the different reflexes in the\nnewborn baby and explain their survival value for\nthe newborn baby.\n\u2666 Drive reduction theory:\n\u25aa Drive is the outcome of an animal\u2019s state of\nbiological needs.\n\u25aa As a result of drive an animal becomes more active.\n\u25aa Drive reduction response woks for biological needs\nlike eating, sleep, avoidance of pain.\nBut motivation can result from two different forces.\n\u2022 External pull of incentives (satisfaction of\nbiological needs)\n\u2022 Internal push of primary drives (community\nmembers may spend two or three days in\ncleaning the spring water or prepare pit\nlatrines for the entire community on voluntary\nbasis)\n50 Introduction to Psychology\n6.2. Social motivation and emotion\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee will\nbe able to describe social motivation\nand emotion.\n\u2666 Need hierarchy theory, by Abraham Maslow, is one of\nthe theories of motivation.\n\u2666 According to this theory when lower needs are met\nhigher needs emerge.\n\u2666 Basically we can put human needs into categories.\nThese are:\n1. Basic or biological needs (the need for food, water,\nshelter, security needs)\n2. Social needs (love, recognition,)\n3. Achievement motivation\n\u25aa Emphasizes the role of setting life goals and the\ninfluence of success or failure experiences to\nattain these goals.\n\u25aa It is an aspiration to succeed at the greatest level\npossible and the desire to avoid the\ndisappointment that results from failure.\n\u25aa Extremely high goals may lead to failure and low-\nlevel goals may result in less satisfaction from\naccomplishments\n51 Introduction to Psychology\n4. Affiliation need\n\u25aa It is the need for affection\n\u25aa It is the feeling of being needed\n\u25aa The need to be member of a family, peer group and\nother informal organizations in the community like\nIdir, Iquib are affiliation needs,\nNOTE: Informal organizations in the community are fertile\ngrounds to promote health extension programs in\nthe community.\n\u25aa Patients must be helped to retain intact with their\nfamily and friends to satisfy their affiliation needs.\n\u25aa Encouraging interactions between community\nmembers facilitates the sharing of experiences\nand the attainment of common goals.\n\u2666 The Problems of emotion\n\u25aa Emotions are feelings.\n\u25aa They have physiological and cognitive elements.\n\u25aa They regulate our behavior.\n\u25aa They prepare us for action\n\u25aa They shape our future behavior\n\u25aaThey regulate our social interactions.\n52 Introduction to Psychology\nExample: Joy, acceptance, fear, surprise, sadness,\ndisgust, anger, and anticipation are different forms\nof emotions.\nActivity: Form small groups (preferably on cultural\nbackgrounds) and ask them to identify the different\ntypes of emotions, their manifestations and how\nthey vary from one culture to another.\n53 Introduction to Psychology\nUNIT SEVEN\nHealth Stress And Coping\nGeneral Objective: At the end of the unit the trainee will\nbe able to describe health stress\nand coping.\n7.1. Stress and Health\nSpecific Objective: at the end of the lesson the trainee\nwill be able to describe stress and\nhealth.\nStress \u2013 (definition)\n\u2666 Stress is physical and emotional response that occurs\nwhen people are exposed to stressors\n\u2666 Stressors are the events that produce stress.\n\u2666 There is cause and effect relationship between stress\nand stressors\nExample of Stressors: -\n\u25aa Death of spouse\n\u25aa Marriage\n\u25aa Divorce\n\u25aa Injury or illness\n\u25aa Financial crisis\n\u25aa Pregnancy or fathered pregnancy\n54 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 Physiological stress response\nThe human body passes through three stages when\nconfronted by stressors. These are:\n1. Alarm reaction stage (involuntary physiological\nchanges)\nExample:\n\u25aa increased sweating\n\u25aa Increased muscle tension\n\u25aa Decreased salivation\n2. Body\u2019s attempt to maintain balance or homeostasis\n\u25aa Specific organs and systems become focus of\nresponse.\n3. Exhaustion stage\n\u25aa Long-term exposure to stress often results in an\noverload\n\u25aa Hormone level rises\n\u25aa If the individual is exposed to different kinds of\nstressors for a long period of time, it may cause\nillness even death.\n\u2666 Direct effect of stress on health\n\u25aaThe immune system weakens and some illnesses\nmay result in.\n\u25aa Among the most common psychosomatic disorders\nare:\n55 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2022 Ulcers\n\u2022 Asthma\n\u2022 Arthritis\n\u2022 High blood pressure\n\u2022 Eczema\n\u2666Cognitive impairments:\n\u2022 Stress prevents people from coping with life\nadequately.\n\u2022 People's understanding of their environment may\nbe clouded.\n\u2666 At emotional level:\n\u2022 Minor criticisms made by a friend are blown out\nof proportion.\n\u2022 Anger and aggression\n\u2022 Apathy and depression\n7.2 Coping skills\nSpecific objective: At the end of the lesson the trainee\nwill be able to describe coping skills\nin stress.\nCoping - definition: It is the effort to control or to reduce\nthe threats that lead to stress.\n56 Introduction to Psychology\nThere are eight types of coping skills. These\nare:-\n\u2666 Emotion focused coping: It is an attempt to reduce\ndisturbing emotions, which\naccompany the experience of stress.\nEmotion focused coping strategies are:\n\u2022 Getting social support from the society and\ninstitutions.\n\u2022 Getting psychological assistance from friends and\nrelatives.\n\u2022 Getting support from ones working place.\n\u2666 Defense mechanisms coping: These are mental\nstrategies we use when we do not wish to face reality.\nExample:\nAvoidance\nDenial\nRepression\n\u2666 Mal-adaptive coping methods\nExample: Taking drugs, heavy alcohol and other stimulants\nto cover the problem for only a limited period of\ntime.\n57 Introduction to Psychology\n\u2666 Problem focused coping:\n\u2022 it is trying to think and understand the problem\nsituation better and taking action to deal with the\nproblem.\n\u2666 Coping appraisal\n\u2022 Thinking about the stressful situation and trying\nto find out ways of solving the problem\n\u2666 Time management\n\u2022 Planning and prioritizing activities\n\u2666 Assertiveness\n\u2022 To say no when there is imposition\n\u2022 It counteracts low self-esteem\n\u2666 Relaxation techniques\n\u2022 Focused attention\n\u2022 Physical exercise\n58 Introduction to Psychology\nReferences\n1.
