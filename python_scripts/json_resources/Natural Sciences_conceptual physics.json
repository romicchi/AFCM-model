The sun and moon both rise in the east\nandsetinthewest. Anotherfactthatcanbesettledtoafairdegree\nof accuracy using the naked eye is that the apparent sizes of the sun\nandmoondon\u2019tchangenoticeably. (Thereisanopticalillusionthat\nmakes the moon appear bigger when it\u2019s near the horizon, but you\ncan easily verify that it\u2019s nothing more than an illusion by checking\nits angular size against some standard, such as your pinkie held\nat arm\u2019s length.) If the sun and moon were varying their distances\nfromus,theywouldappeartogetbiggerandsmaller,andsincethey\ndon\u2019t appear to change in size, it appears, at least approximately,\nthat they always stay at the same distance from us.\nFromobservationslikethese,theancientsconstructedascientific\nmodel, in which the sun and moon traveled around the earth in\nperfect circles.

Science only tries to make models of\ntime-exposure photograph, each\nreality that have predictive power.\nstarappearsasastreak.\nOur modern approach to understanding physics revolves around\nthe concepts of symmetry and conservation laws, both of which are\ndemonstrated by this example.\nThe sun and moon were believed to move in circles, and a circle\nis a very symmetric shape. If you rotate a circle about its center,\nlike a spinning wheel, it doesn\u2019t change. Therefore, we say that the\ncircle is symmetric with respect to rotation about its center. The\nancients thought it was beautiful that the universe seemed to have\nthis type of symmetry built in, and they became very attached to\nthe idea.\nA conservation law is a statement that some number stays the\nsamewiththepassageoftime. Inourexample,thedistancebetween\nthe sun and the earth is conserved, and so is the distance between\nthe moon and the earth. (The ancient Greeks were even able to\n7 determine that earth-moon distance.)\nb/Emmy Noether (1882-1935).

If that was to happen, then it seems as though atoms would\nhave to be created or destroyed, which doesn\u2019t happen in any phys-\nical processes that are familiar from everyday life, such as chemical\nreactions. On the other hand, I\u2019ve already cautioned you against\nbelieving that a law of physics must be true just because it seems\nappealing. The laws of physics have to be found by experiment, and\nthere seem to be experiments that are exceptions to the conserva-\ntion of matter. A log weighs more than its ashes. Did some matter\nsimply disappear when the log was burned?\nThe French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was the first sci-\nentist to realize that there were no such exceptions. Lavoisier hy-\npothesized that when wood burns, for example, the supposed loss\nof weight is actually accounted for by the escaping hot gases that\nthe flames are made of. Before Lavoisier, chemists had almost never\nweighed their chemicals to quantify the amount of each substance\nthat was undergoing reactions. They also didn\u2019t completely under-\nstand that gases were just another state of matter, and hadn\u2019t tried\nperformingreactionsinsealedchamberstodeterminewhethergases\nwere being consumed from or released into the air. For this they\nhad at least one practical excuse, which is that if you perform a gas-\nreleasing reaction in a sealed chamber with no room for expansion,\nyou get an explosion!

Based on many observations of this type, Lavoisier\nproposed a general law of nature, that matter is always conserved.\nself-checkA\nIn ordinary speech, we say that you should \u201cconserve\u201d something, be-\ncause if you don\u2019t, pretty soon it will all be gone.

(cid:46)Answer,\np. 179\nAlthough Lavoisier was an honest and energetic public official,\nhe was caught up in the Terror and sentenced to death in 1794. He\nrequested a fifteen-day delay of his execution so that he could com-\nplete some experiments that he thought might be of value to the\nRepublic.

Weneedtobemoreprecisenowabout\nwhat we really mean by \u201cthe amount of matter,\u201d which is what\nwe\u2019re saying is conserved. Since physics is a mathematical science,\ndefinitions in physics are usually definitions of numbers, and we\ndefine these numbers operationally. An operational definition is one\nthat spells out the steps required in order to measure that quantity.\nFor example, one way that an electrician knows that current and\nvoltage are two different things is that she knows she has to do\ncompletely different things in order to measure them with a meter.\nIf you ask a room full of ordinary people to define what is meant\nby mass, they\u2019ll probably propose a bunch of different, fuzzy ideas,\nand speak as if they all pretty much meant the same thing: \u201chow\ng/The time for one cycle of\nmuch space it takes up,\u201d \u201chow much it weighs,\u201d \u201chow much matter\nvibration is related to the object\u2019s\nmass. is in it.\u201d Of these, the first two can be disposed of easily. If we\nwere to define mass as a measure of how much space an object\noccupied, then mass wouldn\u2019t be conserved when we squished a\npiece of foam rubber. Although Lavoisier did use weight in his\nexperiments, weight also won\u2019t quite work as the ultimate, rigorous\ndefinition, because weight is a measure of how hard gravity pulls on\nanobject,andgravityvariesinstrengthfromplacetoplace. Gravity\nis measurably weaker on the top of a mountain that at sea level,\nand much weaker on the moon. The reason this didn\u2019t matter to\nLavoisier was that he was doing all his experiments in one location.\nThe third proposal is better, but how exactly should we define \u201chow\nh/Astronaut Tamara Jernigan\nmuch matter?\u201d To make it into an operational definition, we could\nmeasures her mass aboard the\ndo something like figure g.

For this reason, the vibration of the mass on the spring\nwill take a longer time if the mass is greater. If we put two different\n10 Chapter 1 Conservation of Mass and Energy masses on the spring, and they both take the same time to complete\none oscillation, we can define them as having the same mass.\nSince I started this chapter by highlighting the relationship be-\ntweenconservationlawsandsymmetries,you\u2019reprobablywondering\nwhat symmetry is related to conservation of mass. I\u2019ll come back to\nthat at the end of the chapter.\nWhen you learn about a new physical quantity, such as mass,\nyou need to know what units are used to measure it. This will lead\nus to a brief digression on the metric system, after which we\u2019ll come\nback to physics.\n1.3 Review of the metric system and\nconversions\nThe metric system\nEvery country in the world besides the U.S. has adopted a sys-\ntem of units known colloquially as the \u201cmetric system.\u201d Even in\nthe U.S., the system is used universally by scientists, and also by\nmanyengineers. Thissystemisentirelydecimal, thankstothesame\neminently logical people who brought about the French Revolution.\nIn deference to France, the system\u2019s official name is the Syst`eme In-\nternational, or SI, meaning International System. (The phrase \u201cSI\nsystem\u201d is therefore redundant.)\nThe metric system works with a single, consistent set of prefixes\n(derivedfromGreek)thatmodifythebasicunits. Eachprefixstands\nfor a power of ten, and has an abbreviation that can be combined\nwith the symbol for the unit. For instance, the meter is a unit of\ndistance. The prefix kilo- stands for 1000, so a kilometer, 1 km, is\na thousand meters.\nIn this book, we\u2019ll be using a flavor of the metric system, the SI,\nin which there are three basic units, measuring distance, time, and\nmass. The basic unit of distance is the meter (m), the one for time\nis the second (s), and for mass the kilogram (kg). Based on these\nunits, we can define others, e.g., m/s (meters per second) for the\nspeed of a car, or kg/s for the rate at which water flows through a\npipe. It might seem odd that we consider the basic unit of mass to\nbe the kilogram, rather than the gram. The reason for doing this\nis that when we start defining other units starting from the basic\nthree, some of them come out to be a more convenient size for use\nin everyday life. For example, there is a metric unit of force, the\nnewton (N), which is defined as the push or pull that would be able\nto change a 1-kg object\u2019s velocity by 1 m/s, if it acted on it for 1 s.\nA newton turns out to be about the amount of force you\u2019d use to\npickupyourkeys. Ifthesystemhadbeenbasedonthegraminstead\nof the kilogram, then the newton would have been a thousand times\nSection 1.3 Review of the metric system and conversions 11 smaller, something like the amount of force required in order to pick\nup a breadcrumb.\nThe following are the most common metric prefixes. You should\nmemorize them.\nprefix meaning example\nkilo- k 1000 60 kg = a person\u2019s mass\ncenti- c 1/100 28 cm = height of a piece of paper\nmilli- m 1/1000 1 ms = time for one vibration of a guitar\nstring playing the note D\nThe prefix centi-, meaning 1/100, is only used in the centimeter;\na hundredth of a gram would not be written as 1 cg but as 10 mg.\nThe centi- prefix can be easily remembered because a cent is 1/100\nofadollar. TheofficialSIabbreviationforsecondsis\u201cs\u201d(not\u201csec\u201d)\nand grams are \u201cg\u201d (not \u201cgm\u201d).\nYoumayalsoencountertheprefixesmega-(amillion)andmicro-\n(one millionth).\nScientific notation\nMost of the interesting phenomena in our universe are not on\nthehumanscale. Itwouldtakeabout1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\nbacteria to equal the mass of a human body. When the physicist\nThomas Young discovered that light was a wave, scientific notation\nhadn\u2019t been invented, and he was obliged to write that the time\nrequired for one vibration of the wave was 1/500 of a millionth of\na millionth of a second. Scientific notation is a less awkward way\nto write very large and very small numbers such as these. Here\u2019s a\nquick review.\nScientificnotationmeanswritinganumberintermsofaproduct\nof something from 1 to 10 and something else that is a power of ten.\nFor instance,\n32 = 3.2\u00d7101\n320 = 3.2\u00d7102\n3200 = 3.2\u00d7103 ...\nEach number is ten times bigger than the last.\nSince 101 is ten times smaller than 102 , it makes sense to use\nthe notation 100 to stand for one, the number that is in turn ten\ntimes smaller than 101 . Continuing on, we can write 10\u22121 to stand\nfor0.1, thenumber tentimes smallerthan100 . Negative exponents\nare used for small numbers:\n3.2 = 3.2\u00d7100\n0.32 = 3.2\u00d710\u22121\n0.032 = 3.2\u00d710\u22122 ...\n12 Chapter 1 Conservation of Mass and Energy A common source of confusion is the notation used on the dis-\nplays of many calculators. Examples:\n3.2\u00d7106 (written notation)\n3.2E+6 (notation on some calculators)\n3.26 (notation on some other calculators)\nThe last example is particularly unfortunate, because 3.26 really\nstands for the number 3.2\u00d73.2\u00d73.2\u00d73.2\u00d73.2\u00d73.2 = 1074, a\ntotally different number from 3.2\u00d7106 = 3200000. The calculator\nnotation should never be used in writing. It\u2019s just a way for the\nmanufacturer to save money by making a simpler display.\nself-checkB\nAstudentlearnsthat104bacteria,standinginlinetoregisterforclasses\natParameciumCommunityCollege,wouldformaqueueofthissize:\nThestudentconcludesthat102bacteriawouldformalineofthislength:\nWhyisthestudentincorrect? (cid:46)Answer,p. 179\nConversions\nI suggest you avoid memorizing lots of conversion factors be-\ntween SI units and U.S. units. Suppose the United Nations sends\nits black helicopters to invade California (after all who wouldn\u2019t\nrather live here than in New York City?), and institutes water flu-\noridation and the SI, making the use of inches and pounds into a\ncrime punishable by death. I think you could get by with only two\nmental conversion factors:\n1 inch = 2.54 cm\nAn object with a weight on Earth of 2.2 pounds-force has a\nmass of 1 kg.\nThe first one is the present definition of the inch, so it\u2019s exact. The\nsecondoneisnotexact, butisgoodenoughformostpurposes. (U.S.\nunits of force and mass are confusing, so it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re\nnot used in science. In U.S. units, the unit of force is the pound-\nforce, and the best unit to use for mass is the slug, which is about\n14.6 kg.)\nMore important than memorizing conversion factors is under-\nstanding the right method for doing conversions. Even within the\nSI, you may need to convert, say, from grams to kilograms. Differ-\nent people have different ways of thinking about conversions, but\nthe method I\u2019ll describe here is systematic and easy to understand.\nThe idea is that if 1 kg and 1000 g represent the same mass, then\nSection 1.3 Review of the metric system and conversions 13 we can consider a fraction like\n103 g\n1 kg\ntobeawayofexpressingthenumberone. Thismaybotheryou. For\ninstance, if you type 1000/1 into your calculator, you will get 1000,\nnot one. Again, different people have different ways of thinking\nabout it, but the justification is that it helps us to do conversions,\nand it works! Now if we want to convert 0.7 kg to units of grams,\nwe can multiply kg by the number one:\n103 g\n0.7 kg\u00d7\n1 kg\nIf you\u2019re willing to treat symbols such as \u201ckg\u201d as if they were vari-\nables as used in algebra (which they\u2019re really not), you can then\ncancel the kg on top with the kg on the bottom, resulting in\n103 g\n0.7(cid:0)k(cid:0)g\u00d7 = 700 g.\n1(cid:0)k(cid:0)g\nTo convert grams to kilograms, you would simply flip the fraction\nupside down.\nOne advantage of this method is that it can easily be applied to\na series of conversions. For instance, to convert one year to units of\nseconds,\n36 15 (cid:24)y(cid:8)d e(cid:24)aa (cid:24)(cid:8) ry(cid:8) s 24 1(cid:24)h (cid:8)do a(cid:24) (cid:8)u y(cid:24) rs 6 10 (cid:24)h(cid:8)m u(cid:24)(cid:8) i(cid:8) n 16 (cid:8)m0 i(cid:8)s\n1(cid:24)ye(cid:24)a(cid:24)r\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 o(cid:24) \u00d7 (cid:8) =\nr n\n= 3.15\u00d7107 s.\nShould that exponent be positive or negative?\nAcommonmistakeistowritetheconversionfractionincorrectly.\nFor instance the fraction\n103 kg\n(incorrect)\n1 g\ndoes not equal one, because 103 kg is the mass of a car, and 1 g is\nthe mass of a raisin.

If we release it at rest, we\nexpect it to remain at rest. If it did start moving all by itself, that\nwould be strange: it would have to pick some direction in which\nto move, and why would it pick that direction rather than some\nother one? If we observed such a phenomenon, we would have to\nconcludethatthatdirectioninspacewassomehowspecial. Itwould\nbe the favored direction in which hockey pucks (and presumably\nother objects as well) preferred to move. That would violate our\nintuition about the symmetry of space, and this is a case where our i/A hockey puck is released\nintuition is right: a vast number of experiments have all shown that at rest. If it spontaneously\nthat symmetry is a correct one. In other words, if you secretly pick scooted off in some direction,\nup the physics laboratory with a crane, and spin it around gently that would violate the symmetry\nofalldirectionsinspace.\nwith all the physicists inside, all their experiments will still come\nout the same, regardless of the lab\u2019s new orientation. If they don\u2019t\nhave windows they can look out of, or any other external cues (like\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field), then they won\u2019t notice anything until\nthey hang up their lab coats for the evening and walk out into the\nparking lot.\nAnother way of thinking about it is that a moving hockey puck\nwould have some energy, whereas a stationary one has none. I\nhaven\u2019t given you an operational definition of energy yet, but we\u2019ll\ngradually start to build one up, and it will end up fitting in pretty\nwell with your general idea of what energy means from everyday\nlife. Regardless of the mathematical details of how you would actu-\nally calculate the energy of a moving hockey puck, it makes sense\nthat a puck at rest has zero energy. It starts to look like energy is\nconserved. A puck that initially has zero energy must continue to\nhave zero energy, so it can\u2019t start moving all by itself.\nYou might conclude from this discussion that we have a new\nexample of Noether\u2019s theorem: that the symmetry of space with re-\nspect to different directions must be equivalent, in some mysterious j/James Joule (1818-1889)\ndiscovered the law of conserva-\nway, to conservation of energy. Actually that\u2019s not quite right, and\ntionofenergy.\nthe possible confusion is related to the fact that we\u2019re not going\nto deal with the full, precise mathematical statement of Noether\u2019s\ntheorem. In fact, we\u2019ll see soon that conservation of energy is re-\nallymorecloselyrelatedtoadifferentsymmetry, whichissymmetry\nSection 1.4 Conservation of energy 15 with respect to the passage of time.\nThe principle of inertia\nNow there\u2019s one very subtle thing about the example of the\nhockey puck, which wouldn\u2019t occur to most people. If we stand\non the ice and watch the puck, and we don\u2019t see it moving, does\nthat mean that it really is at rest in some absolute sense? Remem-\nber, the planet earth spins once on its axis every 24 hours. At the\nlatitude where I live, this results in a speed of about 800 miles per\nhour, or something like 400 meters per second. We could say, then\nthat the puck wasn\u2019t really staying at rest. We could say that it\nwas really in motion at a speed of 400 m/s, and remained in motion\nat that same speed. This may be inconsistent with our earlier de-\nscription, but it is still consistent with the same description of the\nlaws of physics. Again, we don\u2019t need to know the relevant formula\nfor energy in order to believe that if the puck keeps the same speed\n(and its mass also stays the same), it\u2019s maintaining the same energy.\nIn other words, we have two different frames of reference, both\nequally valid. The person standing on the ice measures all velocities\nrelative to the ice, finds that the puck maintained a velocity of zero,\nand says that energy was conserved. The astronaut watching the\nscene from deep space might measure the velocities relative to her\nown space station; in her frame of reference, the puck is moving at\n400 m/s, but energy is still conserved.\nThis probably seems like common sense, but it wasn\u2019t common\nsense to one of the smartest people ever to live, the ancient Greek\nphilosopher Aristotle. He came up with an entire system of physics\nk/Why does Aristotle look based on the premise that there is one frame of reference that is\nso sad? Is it because he\u2019s special: the frame of reference defined by the dirt under our feet.\nrealized that his entire system of\nHe believed that all motion had a tendency to slow down unless a\nphysicsiswrong?\nforce was present to maintain it. Today, we know that Aristotle was\nwrong. One thing he was missing was that he didn\u2019t understand the\nconcept of friction as a force. If you kick a soccer ball, the reason\nit eventually comes to rest on the grass isn\u2019t that it \u201cnaturally\u201d\nwants to stop moving. The reason is that there\u2019s a frictional force\nfrom the grass that is slowing it down. (The energy of the ball\u2019s\nmotion is transformed into other forms, such as heat and sound.)\nModern people may also have an easier time seeing his mistake,\nbecause we have experience with smooth motion at high speeds.\nFor instance, consider a passenger on a jet plane who stands up\nin the aisle and inadvertently drops his bag of peanuts. According\nl/The jets are at rest. The\nto Aristotle, the bag would naturally slow to a stop, so it would\nEmpireStateBuildingismoving.\nbecome a life-threatening projectile in the cabin!

The necessity for\nthe more precise formulation becomes evident if you think about\nexamples in which the motion changes its speed or direction.

The\nFoucaultpendulumwasthefirstdefinitiveexperimentalproofthat\nthe earth really did spin on its axis, although scientists had been\nconvincedofitsrotationforacenturybasedonmoreindirectevi-\ndence about the structure of the solar system.\nPeople have a strong intuitive belief that there is a state of ab-\nsolute rest, and that the earth\u2019s surface defines it. But Copernicus\nproposed as a mathematical assumption, and Galileo argued as a\nmatter of physical reality, that the earth spins on its axis, and also\ncircles the sun. Galileo\u2019s opponents objected that this was impossi-\nble, because we would observe the effects of the motion. They said,\nfor example, that if the earth was moving, then you would never\nbe able to jump up in the air and land in the same place again \u2014\nthe earth would have moved out from under you. Galileo realized\n18 Chapter 1 Conservation of Mass and Energy that this wasn\u2019t really an argument about the earth\u2019s motion but\nabout physics. In one of his books, which were written in the form\nof dialogues, he has the three characters debate what would happen\nif a ship was cruising smoothly across a calm harbor and a sailor\nclimbed up to the top of its mast and dropped a rock. Would it hit\nthe deck at the base of the mast, or behind it because the ship had\nmoved out from under it? This is the kind of experiment referred to\nin the principle of inertia, and Galileo knew that it would come out\nthe same regardless of the ship\u2019s motion. His opponents\u2019 reasoning,\nas represented by the dialog\u2019s stupid character Simplicio, was based\non the assumption that once the rock lost contact with the sailor\u2019s\nhand, it would naturally start to lose its forward motion. In other\nwords, they didn\u2019t even believe in the idea that motion naturally\ncontinues unless a force acts to stop it.\nBut the principle of inertia says more than that. It says that\nmotion isn\u2019t even real: to a sailor standing on the deck of the ship,\nthe deck and the masts and the rigging are not even moving. People\nontheshorecantellhimthattheshipandhisownbodyaremoving\nin a straight line at constant speed. He can reply, \u201cNo, that\u2019s an\nillusion. I\u2019m at rest. The only reason you think I\u2019m moving is\nbecause you and the sand and the water are moving in the opposite\ndirection.\u201d The principle of inertia says that straight-line, constant-\nspeed motion is a matter of opinion. Thus things can\u2019t \u201cnaturally\u201d\nslow down and stop moving, because we can\u2019t even agree on which\nthings are moving and which are at rest.\nIfobserversindifferentframesofreferencedisagreeonvelocities,\nit\u2019snaturaltowanttobeabletoconvertbackandforth.

If we didn\u2019t already\nknow the equation, this experiment would make us suspect that\nit involved the product mh, since that\u2019s what\u2019s the same for both\ngirls.\nOnce we have an equation for one form of energy, we can estab-\nlish equations for other forms of energy. For example, if we drop a\nrock and measure its final velocity, v, when it hits the ground, we\nknow how much GE it lost, so we know that\u2019s how much KE it must\nhave had when it was at that final speed.

If a single\natomfallsthroughaheightofonemeter,itlosesacertainamount\nof gravitational energy and gains a corresponding amount of ki-\nnetic energy. Kinetic energy relates to speed, so that determines\nhow fast it\u2019s moving at the end of its one-meter drop. (The same\nreasoning could be applied to any point along the way between\nzero meters and one.)\nNow what if we stick two atoms together? The pair has double\nthe mass, so the amount of gravitational energy transformed into\nkineticenergyistwiceasmuch. Buttwiceasmuchkineticenergy\nis exactly what we need if the pair of atoms is to have the same\nspeed as the single atom did. Continuing this train of thought, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how many atoms an object contains; it will have\nthe same speed as any other object after dropping through the\nsame height.\n1.5 Newton\u2019s law of gravity\nWhy does the gravitational field on our planet have the particular\nvalueitdoes?

The\ndifferent mass must be the reason for the vastly different gravita-\ntional fields. (The notation 1012 means 1 followed by 12 zeroes.)\nThis makes sense, because gravity is an attraction between things\nthat have mass.\nThe mass of an object, however, isn\u2019t the only thing that deter-\nmines the strength of its gravitational field, as demonstrated by the\ndifference between the fields of the sun and a neutron star, despite\ntheir similar masses. The other variable that matters is distance.\nBecause a neutron star\u2019s mass is compressed into such a small space\n(comparable to the size of a city), a point on its surface is within a\nfairly short distance from every part of the star. If you visited the\nsurface of the sun, however, you\u2019d be millions of miles away from\nmost of its atoms.\nAsalessexoticexample,ifyoutravelfromtheseaportofGuaya-\nquil, Ecuador, to the top of nearby Mt. Cotopaxi, you\u2019ll experience\na slight reduction in gravity, from 9.7806 to 9.7624 J/kg/m. This is\nbecause you\u2019ve gotten a little farther from the planet\u2019s mass.

His\nbook on the motion of material objects, the Mathematical Princi-\nples of Natural Philosophy, was uncontradicted by experiment for\n200 years, but his other main work, Optics, was on the wrong track\ndue to his conviction that light was composed of particles rather\nthan waves. He was an avid alchemist, an embarrassing fact that\nmodern scientists would like to forget. Newton was on the winning\nside of the revolution that replaced King James II with William and\nMary of Orange, which led to a lucrative post running the English\nroyal mint; he worked hard at what could have been a sinecure, and\ntook great satisfaction from catching and executing counterfeiters.\nNewton\u2019s personal life was less happy, as we\u2019ll see in chapter 5.\nNewton\u2019s apple example 12\nA charming legend attested to by Newton\u2019s niece is that he first\nconceived of gravity as a universal attraction after seeing an ap-\nplefallfromatree. Hewonderedwhethertheforcethatmadethe\napple fall was the same one that made the moon circle the earth\nrather than flying off straight. Newton had astronomical data that\nallowed him to calculate that the gravitational field the moon ex-\nperienced from the earth was 1/3600 as strong as the field on\nthe surface of the earth.4 (The moon has its own gravitational\nfield, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about.) The moon\u2019s dis-\ntance from the earth is 60 times greater than the earth\u2019s radius,\nsothisfitperfectlywithaninverse-squarelaw: 60\u00d760 = 3600.\n1.6 Noether\u2019s theorem for energy\nNow we\u2019re ready for our first full-fledged example of Noether\u2019s the-\norem. Conservation of energy is a law of physics, and Noether\u2019s\ntheorem says that the laws of physics come from symmetry. Specif-\nically, Noether\u2019s theorem says that every symmetry implies a con-\nservation law. Conservation of energy comes from a symmetry that\nwe haven\u2019t even discussed yet, but one that is simple and intuitively\nappealing: as time goes by, the universe doesn\u2019t change the way it\nworks. We\u2019ll call this time symmetry.\nWe have strong evidence for time symmetry, because when we\nsee a distant galaxy through a telescope, we\u2019re seeing light that\nhas taken billions of years to get here. A telescope, then, is like a\ntime machine. For all we know, alien astronomers with advanced\ntechnologymaybeobservingourplanetrightnow,5 butifso,they\u2019re\n4See example 12 on page 50.\n5Ourpresenttechnologyisn\u2019tgoodenoughtoletuspicktheplanetsofother z/Example12.\nsolarsystemsoutfromtheglareoftheirsuns,exceptinafewexceptionalcases.\nSection 1.6 Noether\u2019s theorem for energy 27 seeing it not as it is now but as it was in the distant past, perhaps\nin the age of the dinosaurs, or before life even evolved here. As we\nobserve a particularly distant, and therefore ancient, supernova, we\nsee that its explosion plays out in exactly the same way as those\nthat are closer, and therefore more recent.\nNow suppose physics really does change from year to year, like\npolitics, pop music, and hemlines. Imagine, for example, that the\n\u201cconstant\u201dGinNewton\u2019slawofgravityisn\u2019tquitesoconstant. One\ndayyoumightwakeupandfindthatyou\u2019velostalotofweightwith-\nout dieting or exercise, simply because gravity has gotten weaker\nsince the day before.\nIf you know about such changes in G over time, it\u2019s the ultimate\ninsiderinformation. YoucanuseittogetasrichasCroesus, oreven\nBill Gates. On a day when G is low, you pay for the energy needed\ntoliftalargemassuphigh. Then,onadaywhengravityisstronger,\nyou lower the mass back down, extracting its gravitational energy.\nThe key is that the energy you get back out is greater than what\nyou originally had to put in. You can run the cycle over and over\nagain, always raising the weight when gravity is weak, and lowering\nit when gravity is strong. Each time, you make a profit in energy.\nEveryone else thinks energy is conserved, but your secret technique\nallowsyoutokeeponincreasingandincreasingtheamountofenergy\nin the universe (and the amount of money in your bank account).\nThe scheme can be made to work if anything about physics\nchanges over time, not just gravity. For instance, suppose that the\nmass of an electron had one value today, and a slightly different\nvalue tomorrow. Electrons are one of the basic particles from which\natoms are built, so on a day when the mass of electrons is low, every\nphysical object has a slightly lower mass. In problem 14 on page\n35, you\u2019ll work out a way that this could be used to manufacture\nenergy out of nowhere.\nSorry, but it won\u2019t work. Experiments show that G doesn\u2019t\nchange measurably over time, nor does there seem to be any time\nvariation in any of the other rules by which the universe works.6 If\narchaeologists find a copy of this book thousands of years from now,\nthey\u2019ll be able to reproduce all the experiments you\u2019re doing in this\ncourse.\nI\u2019ve probably convinced you that if time symmetry was violated,\nthen conservation of energy wouldn\u2019t hold. But does it work the\n6In 2002, there have been some reports that the properties of atoms as ob-\nservedindistantgalaxiesareslightlydifferentthanthoseofatomshereandnow.\nIf so, then time symmetry is weakly violated, and so is conservation of energy.\nHowever, this is a revolutionary claim, and it needs to be examined carefully.\nThechangebeingclaimedislargeenoughthat,ifit\u2019sreal,itshouldbedetectable\nfromoneyeartothenextinultra-high-precisionlaboratoryexperimentshereon\nearth.\n28 Chapter 1 Conservation of Mass and Energy other way around? If time symmetry is valid, must there be a law\nof conservation of energy? Logically, that\u2019s a different question. We\nmay be able to prove that if A is false, then B must be false, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that if A is true, B must be true as well. For\ninstance, if you\u2019re not a criminal, then you\u2019re presumably not in\njail, but just because someone is a criminal, that doesn\u2019t mean he\nis in jail \u2014 some criminals never get caught.\nNoether\u2019s theorem does work the other way around as well: if\nphysics has a certain symmetry, then there must be a certain cor-\nresponding conservation law. This is a stronger statement. The\nfull-strength version of Noether\u2019s theorem can\u2019t be proved without\na model of light and matter more detailed than the one currently at\nour disposal.\n1.7 Equivalence of mass and energy\nMass-energy\nYou\u2019ve encountered two conservation laws so far: conservation\nof mass and conservation of energy. If conservation of energy is a\nconsequence of symmetry, is there a deeper reason for conservation\nof mass?\nActually they\u2019re not even separate conservation laws. Albert\nEinstein found, as a consequence of his theory of relativity, that\nmass and energy are equivalent, and are not separately conserved\n\u2014 one can be converted into the other. Imagine that a magician\nwaves his wand, and changes a bowl of dirt into a bowl of lettuce.\nYou\u2019d be impressed, because you were expecting that both dirt and\nlettuce would be conserved quantities. Neither one can be made to\nvanish, or to appear out of thin air. However, there are processes\nthat can change one into the other. A farmer changes dirt into\nlettuce, and a compost heap changes lettuce into dirt. At the most\nfundamental level, lettuce and dirt aren\u2019t really different things at\nall; they\u2019re just collections of the same kinds of atoms \u2014 carbon,\nhydrogen, and so on.\nWe won\u2019t examine relativity in detail in this book, but mass-\nenergy equivalence is an inevitable implication of the theory, and\nit\u2019s the only part of the theory that most people have heard of, via\nthe famous equation E = mc2. This equation tells us how much\nenergy is equivalent to how much mass: the conversion factor is the\nsquare of the speed of light, c. Since c is a big number, you get\na really really big number when you multiply it by itself to get c2.\nThis means that even a small amount of mass is equivalent to a very\nlarge amount of energy.\nSection 1.7 Equivalence of mass and energy 29 aa/Example13.\nGravity bending light example 13\nGravity is a universal attraction between things that have mass,\nandsincetheenergyinabeamoflightisequivalenttosomevery\nsmall amount of mass, we expect that light will be affected by\ngravity, although the effect should be very small. The first exper-\nimental confirmation of relativity came in 1919 when stars next\nto the sun during a solar eclipse were observed to have shifted\na little from their ordinary position. (If there was no eclipse, the\nglare of the sun would prevent the stars from being observed.)\nStarlight had been deflected by the sun\u2019s gravity. Figure aa is a\nphotographicnegative,sothecirclethatappearsbrightisactually\nthe dark face of the moon, and the dark area is really the bright\ncorona of the sun. The stars, marked by lines above and below\nthem, appeared at positions slightly different than their normal\nones.\nBlack holes example 14\nA star with sufficiently strong gravity can prevent light from leav-\ning. Quite a few black holes have been detected via their gravita-\ntional forces on neighboring stars or clouds of gas and dust.\nab/A New York Times head-\nBecause mass and energy are like two different sides of the same\nline from November 10, 1919,\ndescribing the observations coin, we may speak of mass-energy, a single conserved quantity,\ndiscussedinexample13. found by adding up all the mass and energy, with the appropriate\nconversion factor: E +mc2.\n30 Chapter 1 Conservation of Mass and Energy A rusting nail example 15\n(cid:46) An iron nail is left in a cup of water until it turns entirely to rust.\nThe energy released is about 500,000 joules. In theory, would a\nsufficiently precise scale register a change in mass? If so, how\nmuch?\n(cid:46) The energy will appear as heat, which will be lost to the envi-\nronment. The total mass-energy of the cup, water, and iron will\nindeed be lessened by 500,000 joules. (If it had been perfectly\ninsulated, there would have been no change, since the heat en-\nergy would have been trapped in the cup.) The speed of light in\nmetric units is c = 3\u00d7108 meters per second (scientific notation\nfor 3 followed by 8 zeroes), so converting to mass units, we have\nE\nm =\nc2\n500,000\n=\n(cid:0) 3\u00d7108(cid:1)2\n= 0.000000000006 kilograms.\n(The design of the metric system is based on the meter, the kilo-\ngram, and the second.

When Einstein came up with relativity, conservation of\nenergy had been accepted by physicists for decades, and conserva-\ntion of mass for over a hundred years.\nDoes an example like this mean that physicists don\u2019t know what\nthey\u2019re talking about? There is a recent tendency among social sci-\nentists to deny that the scientific method even exists, claiming that\nscience is no more than a social system that determines what ideas\nto accept based on an in-group\u2019s criteria. If science is an arbitrary\nsocial ritual, it would seem difficult to explain its effectiveness in\nbuilding such useful items as airplanes, CD players and sewers. If\nvoodoo and astrology were no less scientific in their methods than\nchemistry and physics, what was it that kept them from producing\nanything useful? This silly attitude was effectively skewered in a\nfamous hoax carried out in 1996 by New York University physicist\nAlan Sokal. Sokal wrote an article titled \u201cTransgressing the Bound-\naries: TowardaTransformativeHermeneuticsofQuantumGravity,\u201d\nand got it accepted by a cultural studies journal called Social Text.7\n7The paper appeared in Social Text #46/47 (1996) pp. 217-\nSection 1.7 Equivalence of mass and energy 31 The scientific content of the paper is a carefully constructed soup of\nmumbo jumbo, using technical terms to create maximum confusion;\nI can\u2019t make heads or tails of it, and I assume the editors and peer\nreviewersatSocial Text understoodevenless.

If a theory such\nas conservation of mass or conservation of energy became accepted\nin physics, it was because it was supported by a vast number of ex-\nperiments. It\u2019sjustthatexperimentsneverhaveperfectaccuracy,so\na discrepancy such as the tiny change in the mass of the rusting nail\nin example 15 was undetectable. The old experiments weren\u2019t all\nwrong. They were right, within their limitations. If someone comes\nalong with a new theory he claims is better, it must still be consis-\ntent with all the same experiments. In computer jargon, it must be\nbackward-compatible. This is called the correspondence principle:\nnew theories must be compatible with old ones in situations where\nthey are both applicable. The correspondence principle tells us that\nwe can still use an old theory within the realm where it works, so\nfor instance I\u2019ll typically refer to conservation of mass and conserva-\ntion of energy in this book rather than conservation of mass-energy,\nexcept in cases where the new theory is actually necessary.\nIronically, the extreme cultural relativists want to attack what\ntheyseeasphysicalscientists\u2019arrogantclaimstoabsolutetruth,but\nwhat they fail to understand is that science only claims to be able\nto find partial, provisional truth. The correspondence principle tells\nus that each of today\u2019s scientific truths can be superseded tomorrow\nbyanothertruththatismoreaccurateandmorebroadlyapplicable.\nIt also tells us that today\u2019s truth will not lose any value when that\nhappens.\n252.

It conserves energy as well, since the rebounding Lu\nhas the same energy he started with.\nSuppose you live in a country where the only laws are prohibi-\n37 tions against murder and robbery. One day someone covers your\nhouse with graffiti, and the authorities refuse to prosecute, because\nno crime was committed. You\u2019re convinced of the need for a new\nlaw against vandalism. Similarly, the story of Jen Yu and Iron Arm\nLu shows that we need a new conservation law.\n2.1 Translation symmetry\nThe most fundamental laws of physics are conservation laws, and\nNoether\u2019s theorem tells us that conservation laws are the way they\nare because of symmetry. Time symmetry is responsible for con-\nservation of energy, but time is like a river with only two direc-\ntions, past and future. What\u2019s impossible about Lu\u2019s motion is the\nabrupt reversal in the direction of his motion in space, but neither\ntime symmetry nor energy conservation tell us anything about di-\nrections in space. When you put gas in your car, you don\u2019t have\nto decide whether you want to buy north gas or south gas, east,\nwest, up or down gas. Energy has no direction. What we need is\na new conserved quantity that has a direction in space, and such\na conservation law can only come from a symmetry that relates\nto space. Since we\u2019ve already had some luck with time symmetry,\nwhich says that the laws of physics are the same at all times, it\nseems reasonable to turn now to the possibility of a new type of\nsymmetry, which would state that the laws of physics are the same\nin all places in space. This is known as translation symmetry, where\nthe word \u201ctranslation\u201d is being used in a mathematical sense that\nmeans sliding something around without rotating it.\nTranslation symmetry would seem reasonable to most people,\nbutyou\u2019llseethatitendsupproducingsomeverysurprisingresults.\nTo see how, it will be helpful to imagine the consequences of a\nviolation of translation symmetry. What if, like the laws of nations,\nthe laws of physics were different in different places? What would\nhappen, and how would we detect it? We could try doing the same\nexperiment in two different places and comparing the results, but\nit\u2019s even easier than that. Tap your finger on this spot on the page\n\u00d7\nand then wait a second and do it again. Did both taps occur at\nthe same point in space? You\u2019re probably thinking that\u2019s a silly\nquestion; am I just checking whether you followed my directions?\nNot at all. Consider the whole scene from the point of view of a\nMartian who is observing it through a powerful telescope from her\nhome planet. (You didn\u2019t draw the curtains, did you?) From her\npoint of view, the earth is spinning on its axis and orbiting the sun,\nat speeds measured in thousands of kilometers per hour. According\ntoher, yoursecondfingertaphappenedatapointinspaceabout30\nkilometers from the first. If you want to impress the Martians and\n38 Chapter 2 Conservation of Momentum win the Martian version of the Nobel Prize for detecting a violation\nof translation symmetry, all you have to do is perform a physics\nexperiment twice in the same laboratory, and show that the result\nis different.\nButwho\u2019stosaythattheMartianpointofviewistherightone?\nItgetsalittlethornynow. Howdoyouknowthatwhatyoudetected\nwas a violation of translation symmetry at all? Maybe it was just\na violation of time symmetry. The Martian Nobel committee isn\u2019t\ngoing to give you the prize based on an experiment this ambiguous.\nA possible scheme for resolving the ambiguity would be to wait a\nyear and do the same experiment a third time. After a year, the\nearth will have completed one full orbit around the sun, and your\nlab will be back in the same spot in space. If the third experiment\ncomes out the same as the first one, then you can make a strong\nargument that what you\u2019ve detected is an asymmetry of space, not\ntime. There\u2019saproblem, however. YouandtheMartiansagreethat\nthe earth is back in the same place after a year, but what about an\nobserver from another solar system, whose planet orbits a different\nstar? This observer says that our whole solar system is in motion.\nTo him, the earth\u2019s motion around our sun looks like a spiral or a\ncorkscrew, since the sun is itself moving.\n2.2 The principle of inertia\nSymmetry and inertia\nThis story shows that translation symmetry is closely related to\ntherelativenatureofmotion,asexpressedbytheprincipleofinertia.\nRiding in a train on a long, straight track at constant speed, how\ncan you even tell you\u2019re in motion? You can look at the scenery\noutside, but that\u2019s irrelevant, because we could argue that the trees\nand cows are moving while you stand still. (The Martians say both\ntrain and scenery are moving.) The real point is whether you can\ndetect your motion without reference to any external object. You\ncan hear the repetitive thunk-thunk-thunk as the train passes from\nonepieceoftracktothenext, butagainthisisjustareferencetoan\nexternal object \u2014 all that proves is that you\u2019re moving relative to\nthe tracks, but is there any way to tell that you\u2019re moving in some\nabsolute sense? Assuming no interaction with the outside world, is\nthere any experiment you can do that will give a different result\nwhen the train is in motion than when it\u2019s at rest? You could\nif translation symmetry was violated. If the laws of physics were\ndifferent in different places, then as the train moved it would pass\nthrough them. \u201cRiding over\u201d these regions would be like riding over\nthe pieces of track, but you would be able to detect the transition\nfrom one region to the next simply because experiments inside the\ntrain came out different, without referring to any external objects.\nRather than the thunk-thunk-thunk of the rails, you would detect\nSection 2.2 The principle of inertia 39 increases and decreases in some quantity such as the gravitational\nconstant G, or the speed of light, or the mass of the electron.\nWe can therefore conclude that the following two hypotheses are\nclosely related.\nThe principle of inertia\nThe results of experiments don\u2019t depend on the straight-line,\nconstant-speed motion of the apparatus.\nTranslation symmetry\nThelawsofphysicsarethesameateverypointinspace.

For simplicity, we\u2019ll model them as two identical,\nfeatureless pool balls, a. This may seem like a drastic simplification,\nbut even a collision between two human bodies is really just a series\nofmanycollisionsbetweenatoms. Thefilmshowsaseriesofinstants\nin time, viewed from overhead. The light-colored ball comes in,\nhits the darker ball, and rebounds. It seems strange that the dark\nball has such a big effect on the light ball without experiencing\nany consequences itself, but how can we show that this is really\nimpossible?\n40 Chapter 2 Conservation of Momentum a/Howcanweprovethatthiscol-\nlisionisimpossible?\nWe can show it\u2019s impossible by looking at it in a different frame\nof reference, b. This camera follows the light ball on its way in, so\nin this frame the incoming light ball appears motionless. (If you\never get hauled into court on an assault charge for hitting someone,\ntry this defense: \u201cYour honor, in my fist\u2019s frame of reference, it\nwas his face that assaulted my knuckles!\u201d) After the collision, we\nlet the camera keep moving in the same direction, because if we\ndidn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be showing us an inertial frame of reference.\nTo help convince yourself that figures a and b represent the same\nmotion seen in two different frames, note that both films agree on\nthe distances between the balls at each instant. After the collision,\nframe b shows the light ball moving twice as fast as the dark ball;\nan observer who prefers frame a explains this by saying that the\ncamera that produced film b was moving one way, while the ball\nwas moving the opposite way.\nb/The collision of figure a is\nviewed in a different frame of ref-\nerence.\nFigures a and b record the same events, so if one is impossible,\nthe other is too. But figure b is definitely impossible, because it\nviolates conservation of energy. Before the collision, the only kinetic\nenergy is the dark ball\u2019s. After the collision, light ball suddenly has\nsome energy, but where did that energy come from? It can only\nhave come from the dark ball. The dark ball should then have lost\nsome energy, which it hasn\u2019t, since it\u2019s moving at the same speed as\nbefore.\nFigure c shows what really does happen. This kind of behavior\nis familiar to anyone who plays pool. In a head-on collision, the\nSection 2.3 Momentum 41 incoming ball stops dead, and the target ball takes all its energy\nand flies away. In c/1, the light ball hits the dark ball.

Since they\nstartoutwiththesamespeed, andtheyhavethesamemass, there\u2019s\nno reason for them to behave differently from each other after the\ncollision. By symmetry, if the light ball feels a certain effect from\nthe dark ball, the dark ball must feel the same effect from the light\n42 Chapter 2 Conservation of Momentum ball.\nThis is exactly like the rules of accounting.

The\nearth\u2019s gravitational force on the ball is 10 newtons, so with each\nsecond, the ball\u2019s momentum increases by 10 units, and its speed\nalso increases by 10 m/s. The ball falls 10 m in the first second, 20\nm in the next second, and so on.\nself-checkD\nWhatwouldhappeniftheball\u2019smasswas2kilograms?

What\u2019s different here is that as the moon\nmoves 1,100 meters, it changes its position relative to the earth,\nso down is now in a new direction.

One of the reasons Newton was\nthefirsttomakeanyprogressinanalyzingthemotionoftheplanets\naround the sun was that his contemporaries were confused on this\npoint. Most of them thought that in addition to an attraction from\nthe sun, a second, forward force must exist on the planets, to keep\nthem from slowing down. This is incorrect Aristotelian thinking;\nobjects don\u2019t naturally slow down. Car 1 in figure p only needs a\nforward force in order to cancel out the backward force of friction;\nthe total force on it is zero. Similarly, the forward and backward\nforces on car 2 are canceling out, and the only force left over is the\ninward one. There\u2019s no friction in the vacuum of outer space, so if\ncar 2 was a planet, the backward force wouldn\u2019t exist; the forward\nforcewouldn\u2019texisteither,becausetheonlyforcewouldbetheforce\nof the sun\u2019s gravity.\np/The forces on car 1 can-\ncel, and the total force on it is q/A large number of gentle taps gives a good approximation to\nzero.

Kepler, in con-\ntradiction to his late boss, had formed a prejudice, a correct one\nas it turned out, in favor of the theory that the earth and planets\nrevolved around the sun, rather than the earth staying fixed and\neverything rotating about it. Although motion is relative, it is not\njust a matter of opinion what circles what. The earth\u2019s rotation\nand revolution about the sun make it a noninertial reference frame,\nwhich causes detectable violations of Newton\u2019s laws when one at-\ntemptstodescribesufficientlypreciseexperimentsintheearth-fixed\nframe. Although such direct experiments were not carried out until\nthe 19th century, what convinced everyone of the sun-centered sys-\ntem in the 17th century was that Kepler was able to come up with\na surprisingly simple set of mathematical and geometrical rules for\ndescribing the planets\u2019 motion using the sun-centered assumption.\nAfter 900 pages of calculations and many false starts and dead-end\nideas, Kepler finally synthesized the data into the following three\nlaws:\nKepler\u2019s elliptical orbit law\nThe planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at\none focus.\nKepler\u2019s equal-area law\nThelineconnectingaplanettothesunsweepsoutequalareas\nin equal amounts of time.\n54 Chapter 2 Conservation of Momentum Kepler\u2019s law of periods\nLet T, called the planet\u2019s period, be the time required for a\nplanettoorbitthesun,andletabethelongaxisoftheellipse.\nThen T2 is proportional to a3.\nAlthoughtheplanets\u2019orbitsareellipsesratherthancircles,most u/An ellipse is a circle that\nhas been distorted by shrinking\nare very close to being circular.

The equal-area law implies\nthat a planet in a circular orbit moves around the sun with constant\nspeed. For a circular orbit, the law of periods then amounts to a\nstatement that T2 is proportional to r3, where r is the radius. If\nall the planets were moving in their orbits at the same speed, then\nthe time for one orbit would only increase with the circumference\nof the circle, so we would have a simple proportionality between T\nand r. Since this is not the case, we can interpret the law of periods\nto mean that different planets orbit the sun at different speeds.

By conservation\nof energy, this must also be the amount of energy lost from the\nchemical energy of the gasoline inside the box.9\nNow what if we use the black box to pull a plow? The energy in-\ncrease in the outside world is of a different type than before: mainly\nheat created by friction between the dirt and the ploughshare. The\nbox, however, only communicates with the outside world via the\nhole through which its cable passes. The amount of chemical en-\nergy lost by the gasoline can therefore only depend on F and d, so\nagain the amount of energy transferred must equal Fd.\nThe same reasoning can in fact be applied no matter what the\ncable is being used to do. There must always be a transfer of energy\nfrom the box to the outside world that is equal to Fd. In general,\nwhen energy is transferred, we refer to the amount of energy trans-\nferredaswork,W.

To avoid repeating the same\nmistakes, we need to clearly spell out what we think are the basic\nproperties of time and space that will be a reliable foundation for\nour reasoning.\nExperiments show that:\n1. The laws of physics have translation symmetry (section 2.1),\ntime symmetry (section 1.6), and rotational symmetry (p. 15\nand section 3.3).\n2. The principle of inertia holds (p. 16).\n3. Causality holds, in the sense described on page 72.\n4. Time depends on the state of motion of the observer.\nIf it were not for property 4, we could imagine that figure g\nwould give the correct transformation between frames of reference\nin motion relative to one another. Let\u2019s say that observer 1, whose\ngrid coincides with the gray rectangle, is a hitch-hiker standing by\nthe side of a road. Event A is a raindrop hitting his head, and\n74 Chapter 4 Relativity event B is another raindrop hitting his head. He says that A and B\noccur at the same location in space. Observer 2 is a motorist who\ndrives by without stopping; to him, the passenger compartment of\nhis car is at rest, while the asphalt slides by underneath. He says\nthat A and B occur at different points in space, because during the\ntime between the first raindrop and the second, the hitch-hiker has\nmoved backward. On the other hand, observer 2 says that events A\nand C occur in the same place, while the hitch-hiker disagrees. The\nslope of the grid-lines is simply the velocity of the relative motion\nof each observer relative to the other. (Recall that slope is defined\nas the rise over the run. On these graphs of distance versus time,\nthe slope is the distance traveled divided by the elapsed time.)\nh/In the units that are most\nconvenientforrelativity,thetrans-\nFigure g has familiar, comforting, and eminently sensible behav-\nformation has symmetry about a\nior, but it also happens to be wrong, because it violates property\n45-degreediagonalline.\n4.

Slopes on these graphs are inter-\npreted as velocities. This line has a slope of 1 in our special rel-\nativistic units, but that slope corresponds to some number, call it\nc, in ordinary units of meters per second. Now note what happens\nwhen we perform a Lorentz transformation: this particular line gets\nstretched, but the new version of the line lies right on top of the old\none, and its slope stays the same. In other words, if one observer\nsays that something has a velocity equal to c, every other observer\nwill agree on that velocity as well.\nVelocities don\u2019t simply add and subtract.\nThis is counterintuitive, since we expect velocities to add and\nn/A proof that causality im-\nsubtract in relative motion.

This seems like a\n80 Chapter 4 Relativity paradox: light is supposed to have a specific speed, but there is no\nway to decide what frame of reference to measure it in. The way\nout of the paradox is that light must travel at a velocity equal to c.\nSince all observers agree on a velocity of c, regardless of their frame\nof reference, everything is consistent.\nThe Michelson-Morley experiment\nThe constancy of the speed of light had in fact already been\nobserved when Einstein was an 8-year-old boy, but because nobody\ncould figure out how to interpret it, the result was largely ignored.\nIn 1887 Michelson and Morley set up a clever apparatus to measure\nany difference in the speed of light beams traveling east-west and\nnorth-south.

The basic idea can be demonstrated by dropping a ping-pong\nball and a baseball stacked on top of each other like a snowman.\nThey separate slightly in mid-air, and the baseball therefore has\ntime to hit the floor and rebound before it collides with the ping-\npong ball, which is still on the way down. The result is a surprise\nif you haven\u2019t seen it before: the ping-pong ball flies off at high\nspeed and hits the ceiling! A similar fact is known to people who\ninvestigate the scenes of accidents involving pedestrians. If a car\nmoving at 90 kilometers per hour hits a pedestrian, the pedestrian\nflies off at nearly double that speed, 180 kilometers per hour. Now\nsuppose the car was moving at 90 percent of the speed of light.\nWould the pedestrian fly off at 180% of c?\nr/Anunequalcollision, viewedin\nthe center-of-mass frame, 1, and\nin the frame where the small ball\nis initially at rest, 2. The motion\nis shown as it would appear on\nthefilmofanold-fashionedmovie\ncamera, with an equal amount of\ntime separating each frame from\nthe next. Film 1 was made by\na camera that tracked the center\nof mass, film 2 by one that was\ninitially tracking the small ball,\nand kept on moving at the same\nspeedafterthecollision.\nTo see why not, we have to back up a little and think about\nwherethisspeed-doublingresultcomesfrom. Foranycollision,there\nis a special frame of reference, the center-of-mass frame, in which\nthe two colliding objects approach each other, collide, and rebound\nwith their velocities reversed. In the center-of-mass frame, the total\nSection 4.3 Dynamics 85 momentum of the objects is zero both before and after the collision.\nFigure r/1 shows such a frame of reference for objects of very\nunequalmass.

We know that this is the right result for the outcome of the\ncollision because it conserves both momentum and kinetic energy,\nand everything not forbidden is compulsory, i.e., in any experiment,\nthere is only one possible outcome, which is the one that obeys all\nthe conservation laws.\nself-checkA\nHow do we know that momentum and kinetic energy are conserved in\nfigurer/1? (cid:46)Answer,p. 179\nLet\u2019s make up some numbers as an example. Say the small ball\nhas a mass of 1 kg, the big one 8 kg. In frame 1, let\u2019s make the\nvelocities as follows:\nbefore the collision after the collision\n-0.8 0.8\n0.1 -0.1\nFigurer/2showsthesamecollisioninaframeofreferencewhere\nthe small ball was initially at rest. To find all the velocities in this\nframe, we just add 0.8 to all the ones in the previous table.\nbefore the collision after the collision\n0 1.6\n0.9 0.7\nIn this frame, as expected, the small ball flies off with a velocity,\n1.6, that is almost twice the initial velocity of the big ball, 0.9.\nIf all those velocities were in meters per second, then that\u2019s ex-\nactly what happened. But what if all these velocities were in units\nof the speed of light? Now it\u2019s no longer a good approximation just\nto add velocities. We need to combine them according to the rela-\ntivistic rules. For instance, reasoning similar to that in problem 1,\npage 89 tells us that combining a velocity of 0.8 times the speed of\nlightwithanothervelocityof0.8resultsin0.98, not1.6. Theresults\nare very different:\nbefore the collision after the collision\n0 0.98\n0.83 0.76\nWe can interpret this as follows. Figure r/1 is one in which the\nbig ball is moving fairly slowly. This is very nearly the way the\nscene would be seen by an ant standing on the big ball. According\n86 Chapter 4 Relativity s/An 8-kg ball moving at 83%\nof the speed of light hits a 1-kg\nball. The balls appear foreshort-\nened due to the relativistic distor-\ntionofspace.\nto an observer in frame s, however, both balls are moving at nearly\nthe speed of light after the collision. Because of this, the balls\nappear foreshortened, but the distance between the two balls is also\nshortened. Tothisobserver,itseemsthatthesmallballisn\u2019tpulling\naway from the big ball very fast.\nNowhere\u2019swhat\u2019sinterestingaboutallthis. Theoutcomeshown\nin figure r/2 was supposed to be the only one possible, the only\none that satisfied both conservation of energy and conservation of\nmomentum. So how can the different result shown in figure s be\npossible? The answer is that relativistically, momentum must not\nequal mv. The old, familiar definition is only an approximation\nthat\u2019s valid at low speeds. If we observe the behavior of the small\nballinfigures,itlooksasthoughitsomehowhadsomeextrainertia.\nIt\u2019s as though a football player tried to knock another player down\nwithoutrealizingthattheotherguyhadathree-hundred-poundbag\nfull of lead shot hidden under his uniform \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t seem\nto react to the collision as much as he should. This extra inertia is\ndescribed by redefining momentum as\nmomentum = m\u03b3v.\nAt very low velocities, \u03b3 is close to 1, and the result is very nearly\nmv, as demanded by the correspondence principle. But at very\nhigh velocities, \u03b3 gets very big \u2014 the small ball in figure s has a\n\u03b3 of 5.0, and therefore has five times more inertia than we would\nexpect nonrelativistically.\nEquivalence of mass and energy\nNow we\u2019re ready to see why mass and energy must be equivalent\nas claimed in the famous E = mc2. So far we\u2019ve only considered\ncollisions in which none of the kinetic energy is converted into any\nother form of energy, such as heat or sound. Let\u2019s consider what\nhappens if a blob of putty moving at velocity v hits another blob\nthat is initially at rest, sticking to it. The nonrelativistic result is\nthat to obey conservation of momentum the two blobs must fly off\ntogetheratv/2. Halfoftheinitialkineticenergyhasbeenconverted\nto heat.5\n5A double-mass object moving at half the speed does not have the same\nkinetic energy. Kinetic energy depends on the square of the velocity, so cutting\nSection 4.3 Dynamics 87 Relativistically, however, an interesting thing happens. A hot\nobject has more momentum than a cold object! This is because\nthe relativistically correct expression for momentum is m\u03b3v, and\nthe more rapidly moving atoms in the hot object have higher values\nof \u03b3. In our collision, the final combined blob must therefore be\nmoving a little more slowly than the expected v/2, since otherwise\nthe final momentum would have been alittle greater than the initial\nmomentum. To an observer who believes in conservation of momen-\ntumandknowsonlyabouttheoverallmotionoftheobjectsandnot\nabout their heat content, the low velocity after the collision would\nseem to be the result of a magical change in the mass, as if the mass\nof two combined, hot blobs of putty was more than the sum of their\nindividual masses.\nNow we know that the masses of all the atoms in the blobs must\nbethesameastheyalwayswere. Thechangeisduetothechangein\n\u03b3 with heating, not to a change in mass. The heat energy, however,\nseems to be acting as if it was equivalent to some extra mass.\nBut this whole argument was based on the fact that heat is a\nform of kinetic energy at the atomic level. Would E = mc2 apply to\nother forms of energy as well? Suppose a rocket ship contains some\nelectrical energy stored in a battery. If we believed that E = mc2\napplied to forms of kinetic energy but not to electrical energy, then\nwe would have to believe that the pilot of the rocket could slow\nthe ship down by using the battery to run a heater! This would\nnot only be strange, but it would violate the principle of relativity,\nbecause the result of the experiment would be different depending\nonwhethertheshipwasatrestornot. Theonlylogicalconclusionis\nthat all forms of energy are equivalent to mass. Running the heater\nthen has no effect on the motion of the ship, because the total\nenergy in the ship was unchanged; one form of energy (electrical)\nwas simply converted to another (heat).\nThe equation E = mc2 tells us how much energy is equivalent\nto how much mass: the conversion factor is the square of the speed\nof light, c. Since c a big number, you get a really really big number\nwhenyoumultiplyitbyitselftogetc2. Thismeansthatevenasmall\namount of mass is equivalent to a very large amount of energy.\nWe\u2019ve already seen several examples of applications of E = mc2,\non page 30.\nthe velocity in half reduces the energy by a factor of 1/4, which, multiplied by\nthe doubled mass, makes 1/2 the original energy.\n88 Chapter 4 Relativity Problems\nKey\n\u221a\nA computerized answer check is available online.\n(cid:82)\nA problem that requires calculus.\n(cid:63) A difficult problem.\n1 The figure illustrates a Lorentz transformation using the con-\nventions described on p. 43.

Why dwell on the\nsad side of his life? To the modern science educator, Newton\u2019s life-\nlong obsession with alchemy may seem an embarrassment, a distrac-\ntion from his main achievement, the creation of the modern science\nof mechanics. To Newton, however, his alchemical researches were\nnaturally related to his investigations of force and motion. What\nwas radical about Newton\u2019s analysis of motion was its universal-\nity: it succeeded in describing both the heavens and the earth with\nthe same equations, whereas previously it had been assumed that\nthe sun, moon, stars, and planets were fundamentally different from\nearthly objects. But Newton realized that if science was to describe\nall of nature in a unified way, it was not enough to unite the human\nscale with the scale of the universe: he would not be satisfied until\n93 he fit the microscopic universe into the picture as well.\nIt should not surprise us that Newton failed.

In uniting the human and cosmic scales of existence, he had\nreimagined both as stages on which the actors were objects (trees\nand houses, planets and stars) that interacted through attractions\nand repulsions. He was already convinced that the objects inhab-\niting the microworld were atoms, so it remained only to determine\nwhat kinds of forces they exerted on each other.\nHisnextinsightwasnolessbrilliantforhisinabilitytobringitto\nfruition. He realized that the many human-scale forces \u2014 friction,\nsticky forces, the normal forces that keep objects from occupying\nthe same space, and so on \u2014 must all simply be expressions of a\nmore fundamental force acting between atoms. Tape sticks to paper\nbecause the atoms in the tape attract the atoms in the paper.

Itwastemptingtothinkthattheatomicforce\nwas a form of gravity, which he knew to be universal, fundamental,\nand mathematically simple. Gravity, however, is always attractive,\nso how could he use it to explain the existence of both attractive\nand repulsive atomic forces? The gravitational force between ob-\njects of ordinary size is also extremely small, which is why we never\nnotice cars and houses attracting us gravitationally. It would be\nhard to understand how gravity could be responsible for anything\nas vigorous as the beating of a heart or the explosion of gunpowder.\nNewton went on to write a million words of alchemical notes filled\nwithspeculationaboutsomeotherforce, perhapsa\u201cdivineforce\u201dor\n\u201cvegetative force\u201d that would for example be carried by the sperm\n94 Chapter 5 Electricity to the egg.\nLuckily, we now know enough to investigate a different suspect\nas a candidate for the atomic force: electricity. Electric forces are\noften observed between objects that have been prepared by rubbing\n(orothersurfaceinteractions), forinstancewhenclothesrubagainst\neach other in the dryer. A useful example is shown in figure 5.1/1:\nstick two pieces of tape on a tabletop, and then put two more pieces\non top of them. Lift each pair from the table, and then separate\nthem. The two top pieces will then repel each other, 5.1/2, as\nwill the two bottom pieces. A bottom piece will attract a top piece,\nhowever,5.1/3. Electricalforceslikethesearesimilarincertainways\nto gravity, the other force that we already know to be fundamental:\n\u2022 Electrical forces are universal. Although some substances,\nsuch as fur, rubber, and plastic, respond more strongly to\nelectrical preparation than others, all matter participates in\nelectrical forces to some degree. There is no such thing as a\n\u201cnonelectric\u201d substance. Matter is both inherently gravita-\ntional and inherently electrical.\na/Four pieces of tape are\nprepared, 1, as described in the\n\u2022 Experiments show that the electrical force, like the gravita-\ntext. Depending on which com-\ntional force, is an inverse square force. That is, the electrical bination is tested, the interaction\nforce between two spheres is proportional to 1/r2, where r is can be either repulsive, 2, or\nthe center-to-center distance between them. attractive,3.\nFurthermore, electrical forces make more sense than gravity as\ncandidates for the fundamental force between atoms, because we\nhave observed that they can be either attractive or repulsive.\n5.2 Charge, electricity and magnetism\nCharge\n\u201cCharge\u201d is the technical term used to indicate that an object\nparticipates in electrical forces. This is to be distinguished from\nthe common usage, in which the term is used indiscriminately for\nanything electrical. For example, although we speak colloquially of\n\u201ccharging\u201d a battery, you may easily verify that a battery has no\ncharge in the technical sense, e.g., it does not exert any electrical\nforce on a piece of tape that has been prepared as described in\nsection 5.1.\nTwo types of charge\nWe can easily collect reams of data on electrical forces between\ndifferent substances that have been charged in different ways. We\nfind for example that cat fur prepared by rubbing against rabbit\nfur will attract glass that has been rubbed on silk. How can we\nmake any sense of all this information? A vast simplification is\nSection 5.2 Charge, electricity and magnetism 95 achieved by noting that there are really only two types of charge.\nSuppose we pick cat fur rubbed on rabbit fur as a representative of\ntype A, and glass rubbed on silk for type B. We will now find that\nthere is no \u201ctype C.\u201d Any object electrified by any method is either\nA-like, attracting things A attracts and repelling those it repels, or\nB-like, displayingthesameattractionsandrepulsionsasB.Thetwo\ntypes, A and B, always display opposite interactions. If A displays\nan attraction with some charged object, then B is guaranteed to\nundergo repulsion with it, and vice-versa.\nThe coulomb\nAlthoughthereareonlytwotypesofcharge, eachtypecancome\nin different amounts. The metric unit of charge is the coulomb\n(rhymes with \u201cdrool on\u201d), defined as follows:\nOne Coulomb (C) is the amount of charge such that a force of\n9.0\u00d7109 N occurs between two pointlike objects with charges\nof 1 C separated by a distance of 1 m.\nThe notation for an amount of charge is q. The numerical factor\nin the definition is historical in origin, and is not worth memoriz-\ning. The definition is stated for pointlike, i.e., very small, objects,\nbecause otherwise different parts of them would be at different dis-\ntances from each other.\nA model of two types of charged particles\nExperiments show that all the methods of rubbing or otherwise\ncharging objects involve two objects, and both of them end up get-\nting charged. If one object acquires a certain amount of one type of\ncharge, then the other ends up with an equal amount of the other\ntype. Various interpretations of this are possible, but the simplest\nis that the basic building blocks of matter come in two flavors, one\nwith each type of charge. Rubbing objects together results in the\ntransfer of some of these particles from one object to the other. In\nthismodel,anobjectthathasnotbeenelectricallypreparedmayac-\ntuallypossessesagreatdealofboth typesofcharge,buttheamounts\nare equal and they are distributed in the same way throughout it.\nSince type A repels anything that type B attracts, and vice versa,\nthe object will make a total force of zero on any other object. The\nrest of this chapter fleshes out this model and discusses how these\nmysterious particles can be understood as being internal parts of\natoms.\nUse of positive and negative signs for charge\nBecause the two types of charge tend to cancel out each other\u2019s\nforces,itmakessensetolabelthemusingpositiveandnegativesigns,\nand to discuss the total charge of an object. It is entirely arbitrary\nwhich type of charge to call negative and which to call positive.\nBenjamin Franklin decided to describe the one we\u2019ve been calling\n96 Chapter 5 Electricity \u201cA\u201d as negative, but it really doesn\u2019t matter as long as everyone is\nconsistent with everyone else. An object with a total charge of zero\n(equal amounts of both types) is referred to as electrically neutral.\nself-checkA\nCriticizethefollowingstatement: \u201cTherearetwotypesofcharge,attrac-\ntiveandrepulsive.\u201d (cid:46)Answer,p.\n180\nCoulomb\u2019s law\nA large body of experimental observations can be summarized\nas follows:\nCoulomb\u2019s law: The magnitude of the force acting between\npointlike charged objects at a center-to-center distance r is given\nby the equation\n|q ||q |\n1 2\n|F| = k ,\nr2\nwhere the constant k equals 9.0\u00d7109 N\u00b7m2/C2. The force is attrac-\ntive if the charges are of different signs, and repulsive if they have\nthe same sign.\nConservation of charge\nAnevenmorefundamentalreasonforusingpositiveandnegative\nsigns for electrical charge is that experiments show that with the\nb/A charged piece of tape\nsigns defined this way, the total amount of charge is a conserved attracts uncharged pieces of\nquantity. This is why we observe that rubbing initially uncharged paper from a distance, and they\nsubstances together always has the result that one gains a certain leapuptoit.\namount of one type of charge, while the other acquires an equal\namount of the other type. Conservation of charge seems natural in\nourmodelinwhichmatterismadeofpositiveandnegativeparticles.\nIf the charge on each particle is a fixed property of that type of\nparticle, and if the particles themselves can be neither created nor\ndestroyed, then conservation of charge is inevitable.\nElectrical forces involving neutral objects\nAs shown in figure 5.2.3, an electrically charged object can at-\ntract objects that are uncharged. How is this possible? The key is\nthat even though each piece of paper has a total charge of zero, it\nhas at least some charged particles in it that have some freedom to\nmove. Suppose that the tape is positively charged, 5.2.3. Mobile\nparticles in the paper will respond to the tape\u2019s forces, causing one\nend of the paper to become negatively charged and the other to\nbecome positive.

Physicists before about 1905\nwere in exactly the same situation. They knew all about electrical\ncircuits, and had even invented radio, but knew absolutely nothing\nabout subatomic particles. In other words, it hardly ever matters\nthatelectricityreallyismadeofchargedparticles,andithardlyever\nmatters what those particles are. Nevertheless, it may avoid some\nconfusion to give a brief review of how an atom is put together:\ncharge mass in units of location in atom\nthe proton\u2019s mass\nproton +e 1 in nucleus\nneutron 0 1.001 in nucleus\nelectron \u2212e 1/1836 orbiting nucleus\nThe symbol e in this table is an abbreviation for 1.60 \u00d7 10\u221219 C.\nThe physicist Robert Millikan discovered in 1911 that any material\nobject(heusedoildroplets)wouldhaveachargethatwasamultiple\nof this number, and today we interpret that as being a consequence\nof the fact that matter is made of atoms, and atoms are made of\nparticles whose charges are plus and minus this amount.\nElectric current\nIf the fundamental phenomenon is the motion of charged parti-\ncles, then how can we define a useful numerical measurement of it?\nWe might describe the flow of a river simply by the velocity of the\nwater, but velocity will not be appropriate for electrical purposes\nbecause we need to take into account how much charge the moving\nparticles have, and in any case there are no practical devices sold\nat Radio Shack that can tell us the velocity of charged particles.\nExperiments show that the intensity of various electrical effects is\nrelated to a different quantity: the number of coulombs of charge\nthat pass by a certain point per second. By analogy with the flow\nof water, this quantity is called the electric current, I. Its units\nof coulombs/second are more conveniently abbreviated as amperes,\ne/Andre\u00b4 Marie Ampe`re (1775-\n1836). 1 A=1 C/s. (In informal speech, one usually says \u201camps.\u201d)\n98 Chapter 5 Electricity The main subtlety involved in this definition is how to account\nfor the two types of charge. The stream of water coming from a\nhose is made of atoms containing charged particles, but it produces\nnone of the effects we associate with electric currents. For example,\nyou do not get an electrical shock when you are sprayed by a hose.\nThis type of experiment shows that the effect created by the motion\nof one type of charged particle can be canceled out by the motion of\nthe opposite type of charge in the same direction. In water, every\noxygen atom with a charge of +8e is surrounded by eight electrons\nwith charges of \u2212e, and likewise for the hydrogen atoms.\nWe therefore refine our definition of current as follows:\ndefinition of electric current\nWhenchargedparticlesareexchangedbetweenregionsofspace\nA and B, the electric current flowing from A to B is\nchange in B\u2019s charge\nI = ,\nt\nwhere the transfer occurs over a period of time t.\nIn the garden hose example, your body picks up equal amounts of\npositive and negative charge, resulting in no change in your total\ncharge, so the electrical current flowing into you is zero.\nIons moving across a cell membrane example 1\n(cid:46) Figure f shows ions, labeled with their charges, moving in or\nout through the membranes of four cells.

As we will see, currents flow through metal wires\nvia the motion of electrons, which are negatively charged, so the\ndirection of motion of the electrons in a circuit is always opposite to\nthedirectionofthecurrent.

The only method of\ncontrolling electric charge we have studied so far is to charge differ-\nent substances, e.g., rubber and fur, by rubbing them against each\nother. Figure g/1 shows an attempt to use this technique to light\na lightbulb. This method is unsatisfactory.

The wire will\nquickly begin acquiring a net charge, because it has no way to get\nrid of the charge flowing into it. The repulsion of this charge will\nmake it more and more difficult to send any more charge in, and\nsoon the electrical forces exerted by the battery will be canceled\nout completely. The whole process would be over so quickly that\nthe filament would not even have enough time to get hot and glow.\nThis is known as an open circuit. Exactly the same thing would\nhappen if the complete circuit of figure g/2 was cut somewhere with\na pair of scissors, and in fact that is essentially how an ordinary\nlight switch works: by opening up a gap in the circuit.\nThedefinitionofelectriccurrentwehavedevelopedhasthegreat\nvirtue that it is easy to measure.

Asimplifiedammeter,g/4,\nsimply consists of a coiled-wire magnet whose force twists an iron\nneedle against the resistance of a spring. The greater the current,\nthe greater the force. Although the construction of ammeters may\ndiffer, their use is always the same. We break into the path of the\nelectric current and interpose the meter like a tollbooth on a road,\ng/5. There is still a complete circuit, and as far as the battery and\nbulb are concerned, the ammeter is just another segment of wire.\nDoesitmatterwhereinthecircuitweplacetheammeter? Could\nwe, for instance, have put it in the left side of the circuit instead\nof the right? Conservation of charge tells us that this can make no\ndifference. Charge is not destroyed or \u201cused up\u201d by the lightbulb,\nso we will get the same current reading on either side of it. What is\n\u201cused up\u201d is energy stored in the battery, which is being converted\ninto heat and light energy.\n5.4 Voltage\nThe volt unit\nElectrical circuits can be used for sending signals, storing infor-\nmation, or doing calculations, but their most common purpose by\nfar is to manipulate energy, as in the battery-and-bulb example of\nthe previous section. We know that lightbulbs are rated in units of\nwatts, i.e., how many joules per second of energy they can convert\nintoheatandlight,buthowwouldthisrelatetotheflowofchargeas\nmeasured in amperes? By way of analogy, suppose your friend, who\ndidn\u2019t take physics, can\u2019t find any job better than pitching bales of\nhay. Thenumberof caloriesheburnsperhour willcertainlydepend\non how many bales he pitches per minute, but it will also be pro-\nportional to how much mechanical work he has to do on each bale.\nIf his job is to toss them up into a hayloft, he will got tired a lot\nmore quickly than someone who merely tips bales off a loading dock\nSection 5.4 Voltage 101 into trucks. In metric units,\njoules haybales joules\n= \u00d7 .\nsecond second haybale\nSimilarly, the rate of energy transformation by a battery will not\njust depend on how many coulombs per second it pushes through a\ncircuit but also on how much mechanical work it has to do on each\ncoulomb of charge:\njoules coulombs joules\n= \u00d7\nsecond second coulomb\nor\npower = current\u00d7work per unit charge.\nUnits ofjoules percoulomb areabbreviated asvolts, 1 V=1J/C,\nnamedaftertheItalianphysicistAlessandroVolta. Everyoneknows\nthat batteries are rated in units of volts, but the voltage concept is\nh/AlessandroVolta(1745-1827).\nmore general than that; it turns out that voltage is a property of\nevery point in space.\nTo gain more insight, let\u2019s think again about the analogy with\nthe haybales. It took a certain number of joules of gravitational\nenergytoliftahaybalefromoneleveltoanother. Sincewe\u2019retalking\nabout gravitational energy, it really makes more sense to talk about\nunits of mass, rather than using the haybale as our measure of the\nquantity of matter. The gravitational version of voltage would then\nbe joules per kilogram. Gravitational energy equals mgh, but if we\ncalculatehowmuchofthatwehaveper kilogram,we\u2019recancelingout\nthe m, giving simply gh. For any point in the Earth\u2019s gravitational\nfield, we can assign a number, gh, which tells us how hard it is to\nget a given amount of mass to that point. For instance, the top\nof Mount Everest would have a big value of gh, because of the big\nheight. That tells us that it\u2019s expensive in terms of energy to lift a\ngiven amount of mass from some reference level (sea level, say) to\nthe top of Mount Everest.\nVoltage does the same thing, but using electrical energy. We\ncan visualize an electrical circuit as being like a roller-coaster. The\nbattery is like the part of the roller-coaster where they lift you up to\nthe top. The height of this initial hill is analogous to the voltage of\nthe battery. When you roll downhill later, that\u2019s like a lightbulb. In\nthe roller-coaster, the initial gravitational energy is turned into heat\nand sound as the cars go down the hill. In our circuit, the initial\nelectrical energy is turned into heat by the lightbulb (and the hot\nfilament of the lightbulb then glows, turning the heat into light).\nEnergy stored in a battery example 3\n(cid:46)The1.2Vrechargeablebatteryinfigureiislabeled1800milliamp-\ni/Example3. hours. What is the maximum amount of energy the battery can\nstore?\n102 Chapter 5 Electricity (cid:46) An ampere-hour is a unit of current multiplied by a unit of time.\nCurrent is charge per unit time, so an ampere-hour is in fact a\nfunny unit of charge:\n(1 A)(1 hour) = (1 C/s)(3600 s)\n= 3600 C\n1800 milliamp-hours is therefore 1800\u00d710\u22123 \u00d73600 C = 6.5\u00d7\n103 C.

For what possible reason would the shock have\nhadinsufficientpowertohurtme?\n5.5 Resistance\nWhat\u2019s the physical difference between a 100-watt lightbulb and a\n200-watt one? They both plug into a 110-volt outlet, so according\nto the equation P = IV, the only way to explain the double power\nof the 200-watt bulb is that it must pull in, or \u201cdraw,\u201d twice as\nmuch current. By analogy, a fire hose and a garden hose might be\nserved by pumps that give the same pressure (voltage), but more\nwater will flow through the fire hose, because there\u2019s simply more\nwater in the hose that can flow. Likewise, a wide, deep river could\nflow down the same slope as a tiny creek, but the number of liters\nof water flowing through the big river is greater. If you look at the\nfilaments of a 100-watt bulb and a 200-watt bulb, you\u2019ll see that the\n200-watt bulb\u2019s filament is thicker. In the charged-particle model\nof electricity, we expect that the thicker filament will contain more\ncharged particles that are available to flow. We say that the thicker\nfilament has a lower electrical resistance than the thinner one.\nk/Georg Simon Ohm (1787-\n1854).\nj/A fat pipe has less resistance\nthanaskinnypipe.\nAlthough it\u2019s harder to pump water rapidly through a garden\nhose than through a fire hose, we could always compensate by using\na higher-pressure pump. Similarly, the amount of current that will\nflow through a lightbulb depends not just on its resistance but also\non how much of a voltage difference is applied across it. For many\nsubstances, including the tungsten metal that lightbulb filaments\nare made of, we find that the amount of current that flows is pro-\n104 Chapter 5 Electricity portional to the voltage difference applied to it, so that the ratio\nof voltage to current stays the same. We then use this ratio as a\nnumerical definition of resistance,\nV\nR = ,\nI\nwhich is known as Ohm\u2019s law. The units of resistance are ohms,\nsymbolized with an uppercase Greek letter Omega, \u2126. Physically,\nwhen a current flows through a resistance, the result is to transform\nelectrical energy into heat. In a lightbulb filament, for example, the\nheat is what causes the bulb to glow.\nOhm\u2019s law states that many substances, including many solids\nand some liquids, display this kind of behavior, at least for voltages\nthat are not too large. The fact that Ohm\u2019s law is called a \u201claw\u201d\nshould not be taken to mean that all materials obey it, or that it\nhas the same fundamental importance as the conservation laws, for\nexample. Materials are called ohmic or nonohmic, depending on\nwhether they obey Ohm\u2019s law.\nOn an intuitive level, we can understand the idea of resistance\nby making the sounds \u201chhhhhh\u201d and \u201cffffff.\u201d To make air flow out\nof your mouth, you use your diaphragm to compress the air in your\nchest. The pressure difference between your chest and the air out-\nside your mouth is analogous to a voltage difference. When you\nmake the \u201ch\u201d sound, you form your mouth and throat in a way that\nallows air to flow easily. The large flow of air is like a large current.\nDividingbyalargecurrentinthedefinitionofresistancemeansthat\nwe get a small resistance. We say that the small resistance of your\nmouth and throat allows a large current to flow. When you make\nthe \u201cf\u201d sound, you increase the resistance and cause a smaller cur-\nrent to flow. In this mechanical analogy, resistance is like friction:\nthe air rubs against your lips. Mechanical friction converts mechan-\nical forms of energy to heat, as when you rub your hands together.\nElectrical friction \u2014 resistance \u2014 converts electrical energy to heat.\nIf objects of the same size and shape made from two different\nohmic materials have different resistances, we can say that one ma-\nterial is more resistive than the other, or equivalently that it is less\nconductive. Materials, such as metals, that are very conductive are\nsaid to be good conductors. Those that are extremely poor conduc-\ntors, for example wood or rubber, are classified as insulators. There\nis no sharp distinction between the two classes of materials. Some,\nsuch as silicon, lie midway between the two extremes, and are called\nsemiconductors.\nApplications\nSuperconductors\nAll materials display some variation in resistance according to\ntemperature (a fact that is used in thermostats to make a ther-\nSection 5.5 Resistance 105 mometer that can be easily interfaced to an electric circuit). More\nspectacularly, most metals have been found to exhibit a sudden\nchange to zero resistance when cooled to a certain critical tempera-\nture. They are then said to be superconductors. A current flowing\nthrough a superconductor doesn\u2019t create any heat at all.\nTheoretically, superconductors should make a great many excit-\ning devices possible, for example coiled-wire magnets that could be\nused to levitate trains. In practice, the critical temperatures of all\nmetals are very low, and the resulting need for extreme refrigera-\ntion has made their use uneconomical except for such specialized\napplications as particle accelerators for physics research.\nBut scientists have recently made the surprising discovery that\ncertain ceramics are superconductors at less extreme temperatures.\nThe technological barrier is now in finding practical methods for\nmaking wire out of these brittle materials. Wall Street is currently\ninvesting billions of dollars in developing superconducting devices\nfor cellular phone relay stations based on these materials. In 2001,\nthecityofCopenhagenreplacedashortsectionofitselectricalpower\ntrunks with superconducing cables, and they are now in operation\nand supplying power to customers.\nThere is currently no satisfactory theory of superconductivity in\ngeneral, although superconductivity in metals is understood fairly\nwell. Unfortunately I have yet to find a fundamental explanation of\nsuperconductivity in metals that works at the introductory level.\nConstant voltage throughout a conductor\nThe idea of a superconductor leads us to the question of how\nwe should expect an object to behave if it is made of a very good\nconductor. Superconductors are an extreme case, but often a metal\nwire can be thought of as a perfect conductor, for example if the\nparts of the circuit other than the wire are made of much less con-\nductive materials. What happens if the resistance equals zero in the\nequation\nV\nR = ?\nI\nThe result of dividing two numbers can only be zero if the number\non top equals zero. This tells us that if we pick any two points\nin a perfect conductor, the voltage difference between them must\nbe zero. In other words, the entire conductor must be at the same\nvoltage. Using the water metaphor, a perfect conductor is like a\nperfectly calm lake or canal, whose surface is flat. If you take an\neyedropper and deposit a drop of water anywhere on the surface, it\ndoesn\u2019t flow away, because the water is still. In electrical terms, a\ncharge located anywhere in the interior of a perfect conductor will\nalways feel a total electrical force of zero.\nSuppose, for example, that you build up a static charge by scuff-\n106 Chapter 5 Electricity ing your feet on a carpet, and then you deposit some of that charge\nontoadoorknob,whichisagoodconductor. Howcanallthatcharge\nbeinthedoorknobwithoutcreatinganyelectricalforceatanypoint\ninside it? The only possible answer is that the charge moves around\nuntil it has spread itself into just the right configuration. In this\nconfiguration, the forces exerted by all the charge on any charged\nparticle within the doorknob exactly cancel out.\nWecanexplainthisbehaviorifweassumethatthechargeplaced\non the doorknob eventually settles down into a stable equilibrium.\nSincethedoorknobisaconductor,thechargeisfreetomovethrough\nit. If it was free to move and any part of it did experience a nonzero\ntotal force from the rest of the charge, then it would move, and we\nwould not have an equilibrium.\nIt also turns out that charge placed on a conductor, once it\nreaches its equilibrium configuration, is entirely on the surface, not\non the interior. We will not prove this fact formally, but it is intu-\nitively reasonable (see discussion question B).\nShort circuits\nSo far we have been assuming a perfect conductor. What if it\u2019s\na good conductor, but not a perfect one? Then we can solve for\nV = IR.\nAn ordinary-sized current will make a very small result when we\nmultiply it by the resistance of a good conductor such as a metal\nwire. The voltage throughout the wire will then be nearly constant.\nIf, on the other hand, the current is extremely large, we can have\na significant voltage difference. This is what happens in a short-\ncircuit: acircuitinwhichalow-resistancepathwayconnectsthetwo\nsides of a voltage source. Note that this is much more specific than\nthe popular use of the term to indicate any electrical malfunction\nat all.

Thedarkestregion\ninthecenterisaboutthesizeofourplanet.\nChapter 6\nFields\n6.1 Farewell to the mechanical universe\nAs late as 1900, physicists generally conceived of the universe in\nmechanical terms. Newton had revealed the solar system as a col-\nlection of material objects interacting through forces that acted at\na distance. By 1900, evidence began to accumulate for the exis-\ntence of atoms as real things, and not just as imaginary models\nof reality. In this microscopic realm, the same (successful) Newto-\nnian picture tended to be transferred over to the microscopic world.\nNow the actors on the stage were atoms rather than planets, and\nthe forces were electrical rather than gravitational, but it seemed to\nbe a variation on the same theme. Some physicists, however, began\nto realize that the old mechanical picture wouldn\u2019t quite work. At\na deeper level, the operation of the universe came to be understood\nin terms of fields, the general idea being embodied fairly well in\n\u201cThe Force\u201d from the Star Wars movies: \u201c... an energy field cre-\nated by all living things. It surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds\nthe galaxy together.\u201d Substitute \u201cmassive\u201d for \u201cliving,\u201d and you\nhave a fairly good description of the gravitational field, which I first\ncasually mentioned on page 20. Substitute \u201ccharged\u201d instead, and\n111 it\u2019s a depiction of the electric field.\nTime delays in forces exerted at a distance\nWhat convinced physicists that they needed this new concept of\na field of force? Although we have been dealing mostly with elec-\ntrical forces, let\u2019s start with a magnetic example. (In fact the main\nreason I\u2019ve delayed a detailed discussion of magnetism for so long\nis that mathematical calculations of magnetic effects are handled\nmuch more easily with the concept of a field of force.) First a little\nbackgroundleadinguptoourexample. Abarmagnet,a,hasanaxis\nabout which many of the electrons\u2019 orbits are oriented. The earth\nitself is also a magnet, although not a bar-shaped one. The interac-\ntion between the earth-magnet and the bar magnet, b, makes them\nwant to line up their axes in opposing directions (in other words\nsuch that their electrons rotate in parallel planes, but with one set\nrotating clockwise and the other counterclockwise as seen looking\nalong the axes). On a smaller scale, any two bar magnets placed\nnear each other will try to align themselves head-to-tail, c.\nNow we get to the relevant example. It is clear that two people\nseparated by a paper-thin wall could use a pair of bar magnets to\nsignal to each other. Each person would feel her own magnet trying\nto twist around in response to any rotation performed by the other\nperson\u2019s magnet. The practical range of communication would be\nvery short for this setup, but a sensitive electrical apparatus could\na/A bar magnet\u2019s atoms are pick up magnetic signals from much farther away. In fact, this is\n(partially)aligned.\nnot so different from what a radio does: the electrons racing up\nand down the transmitting antenna create forces on the electrons\nin the distant receiving antenna. (Both magnetic and electric forces\nare involved in real radio signals, but we don\u2019t need to worry about\nthat yet.)\nA question now naturally arises as to whether there is any time\ndelay in this kind of communication via magnetic (and electric)\nforces. Newton would have thought not, since he conceived of\nphysics in terms of instantaneous action at a distance. We now\nknow, however, that there is such a time delay. If you make a\nlong-distance phone call that is routed through a communications\nsatellite, you should easily be able to detect a delay of about half a\nb/A bar magnet interacts\nsecondoverthesignal\u2019sroundtripof50,000miles.

(For a more realistic example, we\u2019d have to have\ntwo radio antennas, not two magnets, but the magnets are easier\nto visualize.) During the flipping, each magnet is still feeling the\nforces arising from the way the other magnet used to be oriented.\nEven though the two magnets stay aligned during the flip, the time\ndelay causes each person to feel resistance as she twists her magnet\naround. How can this be? Both of them are apparently doing\nmechanicalwork,sotheymustbestoringmagneticenergysomehow.\nBut in the traditional Newtonian conception of matter interacting\nviainstantaneousforcesatadistance, interactionenergyarisesfrom\nthe relative positions of objects that are interacting via forces. If\nthe magnets never changed their orientations relative to each other,\nhow can any magnetic energy have been stored?\nThe only possible answer is that the energy must have gone\ninto the magnetic force ripples crisscrossing the space between the\nmagnets.

The weather is ever-changing, of course, but for\nSection 6.1 Farewell to the mechanical universe 113 now let\u2019s just imagine steady wind patterns. Definitions in physics\nare operational, i.e., they describe how to measure the thing being\ndefined.

Charting\nall these measurements on a map leads to a depiction of the field of\nwind force like the one shown in the figure. This is known as the\n\u201csea of arrows\u201d method of visualizing a field.\nNow let\u2019s see how these concepts are applied to the fundamental\nforce fields of the universe. We\u2019ll start with the gravitational field,\nwhich is the easiest to understand. We\u2019ve already encountered the\ngravitational field, g, which we defined in terms of energy. Essen-\ntially, g was defined as the number that would make the equation\nGE = mgh give the right answer. However, we intuitively feel that\nthegravitationalfieldhasadirectionassociatedwithit: down! This\ncan be more easily expressed via the following definition:\ndefinition of the gravitational field\nThe gravitational field, g, at any location in space is found by\nplacing a test mass m at that point. The field is then given\nby g = F/m, where F is the gravitational force on the test\nmass.\nWith this new definition, we get units of N/kg, rather then\nJ/kg/m. These are in fact equivalent units.\nThe most subtle point about all this is that the gravitational\nfield tells us about what forces would be exerted on a test mass by\nthe earth, sun, moon, and the rest of the universe, if we inserted a\ntest mass at the point in question. The field still exists at all the\nplaces where we didn\u2019t measure it.\nSources and sinks\nIf we make a sea-of-arrows picture of the gravitational fields\nsurroundingtheearth, g, theresultisevocativeofwatergoingdown\na drain. For this reason, anything that creates an inward-pointing\nfield around itself is called a sink.

The electric field vector\nis then given by E = F/q, where F is the electric force on the\ntest charge.\nCharges are what create electric fields. Unlike gravity, which is\nalways attractive, electricity displays both attraction and repulsion.\nA positive charge is a source of electric fields, and a negative one is\na sink.\n6.2 Electromagnetism\nThink not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am\nnot come to destroy, but to fulfill. Matthew 5:17\nMagnetic interactions\nAt this stage, you understand roughly as much about the clas-\nsification of interactions as physicists understood around the year\n1800. There appear to be three fundamentally different types of\ninteractions: gravitational, electrical, and magnetic. Many types\nof interactions that appear superficially to be distinct \u2014 stickiness,\nchemical interactions, the energy an archer stores in a bow \u2014 are\nreally the same: they\u2019re manifestations of electrical interactions be-\ntween atoms. Is there any way to shorten the list any further? The\nprospects seem dim at first. For instance, we find that if we rub a\npiece of fur on a rubber rod, the fur does not attract or repel a mag-\nnet. The fur has an electric field, and the magnet has a magnetic\nfield. The two are completely separate, and don\u2019t seem to affect\none another. Likewise we can test whether magnetizing a piece of\niron changes its weight.

Magnetic interac-\ntionsmust existaccordingtothetheoryofrelativity. Tounderstand\nhow this can be, consider how time and space behave in relativity.\nObservers in different frames of reference disagree about the lengths\nof measuring sticks and the speeds of clocks, but the laws of physics\nare valid and self-consistent in either frame of reference. Similarly,\nobservers in different frames of reference disagree about what elec-\ntric and magnetic fields there are, but they agree about concrete\nphysical events. An observer in frame of reference k/1 says there\nare electric fields around the particles, and predicts that as time\ngoes on, the particles will begin to accelerate towards one another,\neventually colliding. She explains the collision as being due to the k/One observer sees an electric\nfield,whiletheotherseesbothan\nelectricalattractionbetweentheparticles.

This observer also predicts that the\nparticles will collide, but explains their motion in terms of both an\nelectric field and a magnetic field. As we\u2019ll see shortly, the mag-\nnetic field is required in order to maintain consistency between the\npredictions made in the two frames of reference.\nTo see how this really works out, we need to find a nice simple\nexample. An example like figure k is not easy to handle, because in\nthe second frame of reference, the moving charges create fields that\nchangeovertimeatanygivenlocation,likewhentheV-shapedwake\nof a speedboat washes over a buoy. Examples like figure j are easier,\nbecause there is a steady flow of charges, and all the fields stay the\nsame over time. Figure l/1 shows a simplified and idealized model\nof figure j. The charge by itself is like one of the charged particles in\nthe vacuum tube beam of figure j, and instead of the wire, we have\ntwo long lines of charges moving in opposite directions. Note that,\nl/A model of a charged par-\nas discussed in discussion question C on page 104, the currents of\nticle and a current-carrying wire,\nthe two lines of charges do not cancel out.

In a real piece of copper wire, there are indeed charged\nparticles of both types, but it turns out that the particles of one\ntype (the protons) are locked in place, while only some of the other\ntype (the electrons) are free to move. The model also shows the\nparticles moving in a simple and orderly way, like cars on a two-\nlane road, whereas in reality most of the particles are organized\ninto copper atoms, and there is also a great deal of random thermal\nmotion. The model\u2019s unrealistic features aren\u2019t a problem, because\nthe point of this exercise is only to find one particular situation that\nshows magnetic effects must exist based on relativity.\nWhat electrical force does the lone particle in figure l/1 feel?\nSince the density of \u201ctraffic\u201d on the two sides of the \u201croad\u201d is equal,\nSection 6.2 Electromagnetism 117 there is zero overall electrical force on the lone particle. Each \u201ccar\u201d\nthat attracts the lone particle is paired with a partner on the other\nside of the road that repels it. If we didn\u2019t know about magnetism,\nwe\u2019d think this was the whole story: the lone particle feels no force\nat all from the wire.\nFigurel/2showswhatwe\u2019dseeifwewereobservingallthisfrom\naframeofreferencemovingalongwiththelonecharge. Here\u2019swhere\nthe relativity comes in. Relativity tells us that moving objects ap-\npear contracted to an observer who is not moving along with them.\nBoth lines of charge are in motion in both frames of reference, but\nin frame 1 they were moving at equal speeds, so their contractions\nwere equal. In frame 2, however, their speeds are unequal. The\ndark charges are moving more slowly than in frame 1, so in frame 2\nthey are less contracted. The light-colored charges are moving more\nquickly, so their contraction is greater now. The \u201ccars\u201d on the two\nsides of the \u201croad\u201d are no longer paired off, so the electrical forces\non the lone particle no longer cancel out as they did in l/1. The\nlone particle is attracted to the wire, because the particles attract-\ning it are more dense than the ones repelling it. Furthermore, the\nattractionfeltbythelonechargemustbepurelyelectrical, sincethe\nlone charge is at rest in this frame of reference, and magnetic effects\noccur only between moving charges and other moving charges.\nNow observers in frames 1 and 2 disagree about many things,\nbut they do agree on concrete events. Observer 2 is going to see\nthe lone particle drift toward the wire due to the wire\u2019s electrical\nattraction, gradually speeding up, and eventually hit the wire. If 2\nsees this collision, then 1 must as well. But 1 knows that the total\nelectrical force on the lone particle is exactly zero. There must be\nsome new type of force. She invents a name for this new type of\nforce: magnetism. This was a particularly simple example, because\nthe force was purely magnetic in one frame of reference, and purely\nelectrical in another. In general, an observer in a certain frame\nof reference will measure a mixture of electric and magnetic fields,\nwhile an observer in another frame, in motion with respect to the\nfirst,saysthatthesamevolumeofspacecontainsadifferentmixture.\nWe therefore arrive at the conclusion that electric and magnetic\nphenomenaaren\u2019tseparate.

(We know that flipping the charge\nreverses the interaction, because that\u2019s the way it works for elec-\ntric forces, and magnetic forces are just electric forces viewed in a\ndifferent frame of reference.)\nA magnetic weathervane placed near a current. example 1\nFigurenshowsamagneticweathervane,consistingoftwocharges\nn/Example1\nthat spin in circles around the axis of the arrow.

Justlikethemagneticcompassinfigureh,\nthe weathervane\u2019s arrow tends to align itself in the direction per-\npendicular to the wire. This is its preferred orientation because\nthe charge close to the wire is attracted to the wire, while the\ncharge far from the wire is repelled by it.\nMagnetic fields\nHow should we define the magnetic field? When two objects at-\ntract each other gravitationally, their gravitational energy depends\nonly on the distance between them, and it seems intuitively reason-\nable that we define the gravitational field arrows like a street sign\nthat says \u201cthis way to lower gravitational energy.\u201d The same idea\nworks fine for the electric field. But what if two charged particles\nare interacting magnetically? Their interaction doesn\u2019t just depend\non the distance, but also on their motions.\nWe need some way to pick out some direction in space, so we\ncan say, \u201cthis is the direction of the magnetic field around here.\u201d A\nnaturalandsimplemethodistodefinethemagneticfield\u2019sdirection\naccording to the direction a compass points.

For that matter, let\u2019s model\nthe atoms as weathervanes like the one in figure n. Suppose we\nput two such weather vanes side by side, with their arrows both\npointing away from us. From our point of view, they\u2019re both spin-\nning clockwise. As one of the charges in the left-hand weather\nvane comes down on the right side, one of the charges in the\nright-hand vane comes up on the left side. These two charges\nare close together, so their magnetic interaction is very strong at\nthis moment. Their interaction is repulsive, so this is an unstable\narrangement of the two weathervanes.\nOn the other hand, suppose the left-hand weathervane is point-\ning away from is, while its partner on the right is pointing toward\nus. From our point of view, we see the one on the right spinning\ncounterclockwise. At the moment when their charges come as\nclose as possible, they\u2019re both on the way up.

A force perpendicular\nto the direction of motion is exactly what is required for circular\nmotion, so we find that a charged particle in a vacuum will go in\na circle around the magnetic field arrows (or perhaps a corkscrew\npattern, if it also has some motion along the direction of the field).\nThat means that magnetic fields tend to trap charged particles.\nFigure r shows this principle in action. A beam of electrons is\ncreated in a vacuum tube, in which a small amount of hydrogen\ngas has been left. A few of the electrons strike hydrogen molecules,\ncreating light and letting us see the path of the beam. A magnetic\nfield is produced by passing a current (meter) through the circular\ncoils of wire in front of and behind the tube.

Figure t\nshows an example that doesn\u2019t even involve two different frames of\nreference. This phenomenon of induced electric fields \u2014 fields that\narenotduetocharges\u2014wasapurelyexperimentalaccomplishment\nby Michael Faraday (1791-1867), the son of a blacksmith who had\nto struggle against the rigid class structure of 19th century Eng-\nland. Faraday, working in 1831, had only a vague and general idea\nthat electricity and magnetism were related to each other, based on\nOersted\u2019s demonstration, a decade before, that magnetic fields were\ncaused by electric currents.\nFigure t is a simplified drawing of the experiment, as described\nin Faraday\u2019s original paper: \u201cTwo hundred and three feet of cop-\nper wire ...were passed round a large block of wood; [another] two\nhundred and three feet of similar wire were interposed as a spiral\nbetween the turns of the first, and metallic contact everywhere pre-\nventedbytwine[insulation]. Oneofthese[coils]wasconnectedwith\na galvanometer [voltmeter], and the other with a battery...When\nthe contact was made, there was a sudden and very slight effect at\nthe galvanometer, and there was also a similar slight effect when\nthe contact with the battery was broken. But whilst the ...current\nwas continuing to pass through the one [coil], no ...effect ...upon\nthe other [coil] could be perceived, although the active power of the\nbattery was proved to be great, by its heating the whole of its own\ncoil [through ordinary resistive heating] ...\u201d\nFrom Faraday\u2019s notes and publications, it appears that the sit-\nuation in figure t/3 was a surprise to him, and he probably thought\nt/Faraday\u2019s experiment, sim-\nit would be a surprise to his readers, as well. That\u2019s why he offered\nplified and shown with modern\nequipment. evidence that the current was still flowing: to show that the battery\nhadn\u2019t just died. The induction effect occurred during the short\n122 Chapter 6 Fields time it took for the black coil\u2019s magnetic field to be established, t/2.\nEven more counterintuitively, we get an effect, equally strong but\nin the opposite direction, when the circuit is broken, t/4. The effect\noccurs only when the magnetic field is changing: either ramping up\nor ramping down.\nWhat are we really measuring here with the voltmeter? A volt-\nmeter is nothing more than a resistor with an attachment for mea-\nsuring the current through it. A current will not flow through a\nresistor unless there is some electric field pushing the electrons, so\nwe conclude that the changing magnetic field has produced an elec-\ntric field in the surrounding space. Since the white wire is not a\nperfect conductor, there must be electric fields in it as well. The\nremarkable thing about the circuit formed by the white wire is that\nas the electrons travel around and around, they are always being\npushed forward by electric fields. That is, the electric field seems to\nform a curly pattern, like a whirlpool.\nWhat Faraday observed was an example of the following princi-\nple:\nthe principle of induction\nAny magnetic field that changes over time will create an electric\nu/The geometry of induced\nfield.

One is the principle of induction, and the other is the idea\nthataccordingtorelativity,observersindifferentframesofreference\nmust perceive different mixtures of magnetic and electric fields. At\nthe time Faraday was working, relativity was still 70 years in the\nfuture, so the relativistic concepts weren\u2019t available \u2014 to him, his\nobservations were just surprising empirical facts. But in fact, the\nrelativistic idea about frames of reference has a logical connection\nto the idea of induction.\nFigure x is a nice example that can be interpreted either way.\nObserver A is at rest with respect to the bar magnets, and sees\nthe particle swerving off in the z direction, as it should according\nto the right-hand rule. Suppose observer B, on the other hand, is\nmoving to the right along the x axis, initially at the same speed\nas the particle. B sees the bar magnets moving to the left and the\nparticle initially at rest but then accelerating along the z axis in a\nstraightline.

Bisthusledtotheinescapable\nconclusionthatthereisanelectricfieldinthisregionofspace,which\npoints along the z axis. In other words, what A perceives as a pure\nmagnetic field, B sees as a mixture of electric and magnetic fields.\nThis is what we expect based on the relativistic arguments, but it\u2019s\nalso what\u2019s required by the principle of induction. In B\u2019s frame of\nreference, there\u2019s initially no magnetic field, but then a couple of\nbar magnets come barging in and create one. This is a change in\nthe magnetic field, so the principle of induction predicts that there\nmust be an electric field as well.\nElectromagnetic waves\nTheoristJamesClerkMaxwellwasthefirsttoworkouttheprin-\nciple of induction (including the detailed numerical and geometric\nrelationships, which we won\u2019t go into here).

As an electric\nwave washes over you, you feel an electric field that changes over\ntime. By the principle of induction, there must also be a magnetic\nfield accompanying it. It works the other way, too. It may seem a\nlittle spooky that the electric field causes the magnetic field while\nthe magnetic field causes the electric field, but the waves themselves\ndon\u2019t seem to worry about it.\nThedistancefromonerippletothenextiscalledthewavelength\nof the light.

For instance, we\u2019ve seen that\nif you tried to omit magnetism from the laws of physics, electrical\ninteractions wouldn\u2019t make sense as seen by observers in different\nframes of reference; magnetism is required by relativity.\nThe magnetic interaction rules in figure m are consistent with the\ntime-reversal symmetry of the laws of physics. In other words, the\nrules still work correctly if you reverse the particles\u2019 directions of\nmotion. Now you get to play God (and fail). Suppose you\u2019re going\nto make an alternative version of the laws of physics by reversing\nProblems 127 the direction of motion of only one of the eight particles.

Prove that all of these mod-\nified sets of physical laws are impossible, either because the are\nself-contradictory, or because they violate time-reversal symmetry.\n2 The purpose of this problem is to show that the magnetic in-\nteraction rules shown in figure m can be simplified by stating them\nin terms of current. Recall that, as discussed in discussion question\nC on page 104, one type of charge moving in a particular direction\nproduces the same current as the other type of charge moving in\nthe opposite direction. Let\u2019s say arbitrarily that the current made\nby the dark type of charged particle is in the direction it\u2019s moving,\nwhile a light-colored particle produces a current in the direction op-\nposite to its motion.

Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t surprise\nus, then, that Newton succeeded so well in explaining the motion of\nobjects, but was far less successful with the study of light.\nTheclimaxofourstudyofelectricityandmagnetismwasdiscov-\nery that light is an electromagnetic wave. Knowing this, however, is\nnot the same as knowing everything about eyes and telescopes. In\nfact, the full description of light as a wave can be rather cumber-\nsome. In this chapter, we\u2019ll instead make use of a simpler model of\nlight, the ray model, which does a fine job in most practical situa-\ntions. Not only that, but we\u2019ll even backtrack a little and start with\na discussion of basic ideas about light and vision that predated the\ndiscovery of electromagnetic waves.\n131 The nature of light\nThe cause and effect relationship in vision\nDespite its title, this chapter is far from your first look at light.\nThatfamiliaritymightseemlikeanadvantage,butmostpeoplehave\nnever thought carefully about light and vision. Even smart people\nwho have thought hard about vision have come up with incorrect\nideas. The ancient Greeks, Arabs and Chinese had theories of light\nand vision, all of which were mostly wrong, and all of which were\naccepted for thousands of years.\nOne thing the ancients did get right is that there is a distinction\nbetween objects that emit light and objects that don\u2019t. When you\nsee a leaf in the forest, it\u2019s because three different objects are doing\ntheir jobs: the leaf, the eye, and the sun. But luminous objects\nlike the sun, a flame, or the filament of a light bulb can be seen by\nthe eye without the presence of a third object. Emission of light\nis often, but not always, associated with heat. In modern times,\nwe are familiar with a variety of objects that glow without being\nheated, including fluorescent lights and glow-in-the-dark toys.\nHowdoweseeluminousobjects? TheGreekphilosophersPythago-\nras (b. ca. 560 BC) and Empedocles of Acragas (b. ca. 492\nBC), who unfortunately were very influential, claimed that when\nyou looked at a candle flame, the flame and your eye were both\nsending out some kind of mysterious stuff, and when your eye\u2019s stuff\ncollided with the candle\u2019s stuff, the candle would become evident to\nyour sense of sight.\nBizarre as the Greek \u201ccollision of stuff theory\u201d might seem, it\nhad a couple of good features. It explained why both the candle\nand your eye had to be present for your sense of sight to function.\nThe theory could also easily be expanded to explain how we see\nnonluminous objects. If a leaf, for instance, happened to be present\nat the site of the collision between your eye\u2019s stuff and the candle\u2019s\nstuff, then the leaf would be stimulated to express its green nature,\nallowing you to perceive it as green.\nModern people might feel uneasy about this theory, since it sug-\ngests that greenness exists only for our seeing convenience, implying\na human precedence over natural phenomena. Nowadays, people\nwould expect the cause and effect relationship in vision to be the\nother way around, with the leaf doing something to our eye rather\nthan our eye doing something to the leaf. But how can you tell?\nThe most common way of distinguishing cause from effect is to de-\ntermine which happened first, but the process of seeing seems to\noccur too quickly to determine the order in which things happened.\nCertainly there is no obvious time lag between the moment when\nyou move your head and the moment when your reflection in the\nmirror moves.\n132 Chapter 7 The Ray Model of Light Today,photographyprovidesthesimplestexperimentalevidence\nthatnothinghastobeemittedfromyoureyeandhittheleafinorder\nto make it \u201cgreenify.\u201d A camera can take a picture of a leaf even\nif there are no eyes anywhere nearby. Since the leaf appears green\nregardless of whether it is being sensed by a camera, your eye, or\nan insect\u2019s eye, it seems to make more sense to say that the leaf\u2019s\ngreenness is the cause, and something happening in the camera or\neye is the effect.\nLight is a thing, and it travels from one point to another.\nAnother issue that few people have considered is whether a can-\ndle\u2019s flame simply affects your eye directly, or whether it sends out\nlight which then gets into your eye. Again, the rapidity of the effect\nmakesit difficulttotellwhat\u2019shappening.

The fact that we speak casually today of \u201cthe\nspeed of light\u201d implies that at some point in history, somebody\nsucceededinshowingthatlightdidnottravelinfinitelyfast. Galileo\ntried, and failed, to detect a finite speed for light, by arranging with\na person in a distant tower to signal back and forth with lanterns.\nGalileo uncovered his lantern, and when the other person saw the\nlight, he uncovered his lantern. Galileo was unable to measure any\ntime lag that was significant compared to the limitations of human\nreflexes.\nThe first person to prove that light\u2019s speed was finite, and to\ndetermine it numerically, was Ole Roemer, in a series of measure-\nSection 7.1 Light rays 133 ments around the year 1675.

Since the distance is\nchanging gradually due to the two planets\u2019 orbital motions, a finite\nspeed of light would make the \u201cIo clock\u201d appear to run faster as the\nplanets drew near each other, and more slowly as their separation\nincreased. Roemer did find a variation in the apparent speed of Io\u2019s\norbits, which caused Io\u2019s eclipses by Jupiter (the moments when Io\npassed in front of or behind Jupiter) to occur about 7 minutes early\nwhen the earth was closest to Jupiter, and 7 minutes late when it\nwas farthest. Based on these measurements, Roemer estimated the\nspeed of light to be approximately 2\u00d7108 m/s, which is in the right\nballparkcomparedtomodernmeasurementsof3\u00d7108 m/s.

There is an obvious delay between when you see their\npalms come together and when you hear the clap.\nThe fundamental distinction between sound and light is that\nsound is an oscillation in air pressure, so it requires air (or some\nother medium such as water) in which to travel. Today, we know\nthat outer space is a vacuum, so the fact that we get light from the\nsun, moon and stars clearly shows that air is not necessary for the\npropagation of light.\n134 Chapter 7 The Ray Model of Light Interaction of light with matter\nAbsorption of light\nThe reason why the sun feels warm on your skin is that the\nsunlightisbeingabsorbed,andthelightenergyisbeingtransformed\ninto heat energy. The same happens with artificial light, so the net\nresult of leaving a light turned on is to heat the room. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter whether the source of the light is hot, like the sun, a flame,\nor an incandescent light bulb, or cool, like a fluorescent bulb. (If\nyour house has electric heat, then there is absolutely no point in\nfastidiously turning off lights in the winter; the lights will help to\nheat the house at the same dollar rate as the electric heater.)\nThis process of heating by absorption is entirely different from\nheating by thermal conduction, as when an electric stove heats\nspaghettisaucethroughapan. Heatcanonlybeconductedthrough\nmatter, but there is vacuum between us and the sun, or between us\nandthefilamentofanincandescentbulb. Also, heatconductioncan\nonly transfer heat energy from a hotter object to a colder one, but a\ncool fluorescent bulb is perfectly capable of heating something that\nhad already started out being warmer than the bulb itself.\nHow we see nonluminous objects\nNot all the light energy that hits an object is transformed into\nheat. Some is reflected, and this leads us to the question of how\nwe see nonluminous objects. If you ask the average person how we\nsee a light bulb, the most likely answer is \u201cThe light bulb makes\nlight, which hits our eyes.\u201d But if you ask how we see a book, they\nare likely to say \u201cThe bulb lights up the room, and that lets me\nsee the book.\u201d All mention of light actually entering our eyes has\nmysteriously disappeared.\nMost people would disagree if you told them that light was re-\nflected from the book to the eye, because they think of reflection as\nsomething that mirrors do, not something that a book does. They\nassociate reflection with the formation of a reflected image, which\ndoes not seem to appear in a piece of paper. d/Two self-portraits of the\nauthor, one taken in a mirror and\nImagine that you are looking at your reflection in a nice smooth\nonewithapieceofaluminumfoil.\npiece of aluminum foil, fresh off the roll.

Diffuse reflection is how we see nonluminous objects.\nSpecular reflection only allows us to see images of objects other\nthan the one doing the reflecting. In top part of figure d, imagine\nthat the rays of light are coming from the sun. If you are looking\ndown at the reflecting surface, there is no way for your eye-brain\nsystem to tell that the rays are not really coming from a sun down\nbelow you.\nFigure f shows another example of how we can\u2019t avoid the con-\nclusion that light bounces off of things other than mirrors. The\nlamp is one I have in my house. It has a bright bulb, housed in a\ncompletely opaque bowl-shaped metal shade. The only way light\ncan get out of the lamp is by going up out of the top of the bowl.\nThe fact that I can read a book in the position shown in the figure\nmeans that light must be bouncing off of the ceiling, then bouncing\noff of the book, then finally getting to my eye.\nThis is where the shortcomings of the Greek theory of vision\nbecome glaringly obvious. In the Greek theory, the light from the\nbulb and my mysterious \u201ceye rays\u201d are both supposed to go to the\nbook, where they collide, allowing me to see the book. But we now\nhave a total of four objects: lamp, eye, book, and ceiling. Where\ndoes the ceiling come in? Does it also send out its own mysterious\n\u201cceiling rays,\u201d contributing to a three-way collision at the book?\nThat would just be too bizarre to believe!\nThe differences among white, black, and the various shades of\nf/Light bounces off of the gray in between is a matter of what percentage of the light they\nceiling,thenoffofthebook.\nabsorb and what percentage they reflect.

Figuregshows\nsome more examples. More formally, this is known as the ray model\nof light. The ray model of light seems natural once we convince\nourselves that light travels through space, and observe phenomena\nlike sunbeams coming through holes in clouds. If you\u2019ve read chap-\nter 6, you\u2019ve already been introduced to the concept of light as an\nelectromagnetic wave, and you know that the ray model is not the\nultimate truth about light, but the ray model is simpler, and in any\ncase science always deals with models of reality, not the ultimate\nnature of reality. Figure h summarizes three models of light.\n136 Chapter 7 The Ray Model of Light g/Examplesofraydiagrams.\nh/Threemodelsoflight.\nThe ray model is a generic one. By using it we can discuss the\npathtakenbythelight,withoutcommittingourselvestoanyspecific\ndescription of what it is that is moving along that path. We will\nuse the nice simple ray model for rest of this chapter, and with it\nwe can analyze a great many devices and phenomena.\nNote that the statements about the applicability of the various\nmodelsareonlyroughguides. Forinstance,waveinterferenceeffects\nare often detectable, if small, when light passes around an obstacle\nthat is quite a bit bigger than a wavelength. Also, the criterion for\nwhen we need the particle model really has more to do with energy\nscales than distance scales, although the two turn out to be related.\nThe alert reader may have noticed that the wave model is re-\nquired at scales smaller than a wavelength of light (on the order of a\nmicrometerforvisiblelight), andtheparticlemodelisdemandedon\nthe atomic scale or lower (a typical atom being a nanometer or so in\nsize). This implies that at the smallest scales we need both the wave\nmodel and the particle model. They appear incompatible, so how\ncan we simultaneously use both? The answer is that they are not\nas incompatible as they seem. Light is both a wave and a particle,\nSection 7.1 Light rays 137 and a full understanding of this apparently nonsensical statement\nwould lead us to a discussion of the quantum physics revolution of\nthe twentieth century.\nGeometry of specular reflection\nSpecular reflection obeys two simple geometrical rules:\n\u2022 Theangleofthereflectedrayisthesameasthatoftheincident\nray.\n\u2022 The reflected ray lies in the plane containing the incident ray\nand the normal (perpendicular) line.

The\nrays appear to have come from a point above the goldfish\u2019s actual\nlocation, an effect that is familiar to people who have tried spear-\nfishing.\n\u2022 A stream of light is not really confined to a finite number of\nnarrow lines. We just draw it that way. In j/1, it has been\nnecessary to choose a finite number of rays to draw (five),\nrather than the theoretically infinite number of rays that will\ndiverge from that point.\n\u2022 There is a tendency to conceptualize rays incorrectly as ob-\njects. In his Optics, Newton goes out of his way to caution\nthe reader against this, saying that some people \u201cconsider ...\ntherefractionof... raystobethebendingorbreakingofthem\nin their passing out of one medium into another.\u201d But a ray\n138 Chapter 7 The Ray Model of Light is a record of the path traveled by light, not a physical thing\nthat can be bent or broken.\n\u2022 In theory, rays may continue infinitely far into the past and\nfuture, but we need to draw lines of finite length. In j/1, a\njudicious choice has been made as to where to begin and end\nthe rays. There is no point in continuing the rays any farther\nthan shown, because nothing new and exciting is going to\nhappen to them. There is also no good reason to start them\nearlier,beforebeingreflectedbythefish,becausethedirection\nofthediffuselyreflectedraysisrandomanyway, andunrelated\nto the direction of the original, incoming ray.\n\u2022 When representing diffuse reflection in a ray diagram, many\nstudents have a mental block against drawing many rays fan-\nning out from the same point. Often, as in example j/2, the\nproblem is the misconception that light can only be reflected\nin one direction from one point.\n\u2022 Another difficulty associated with diffuse reflection, example\nj/3, is the tendency to think that in addition to drawing many\nrays coming out of one point, we should also be drawing many\nrays coming from many points. In j/1, drawing many rays\ncoming out of one point gives useful information, telling us,\nforinstance,thatthefishcanbeseenfromanyangle. Drawing\nmany sets of rays, as in j/3, does not give us any more useful\ninformation, and just clutters up the picture in this example.\nThe only reason to draw sets of rays fanning out from more\nthan one point would be if different things were happening to\nthe different sets.\nj/1.

In that case, why does a\ndistant candle appear dim? Likewise, our sun is just a star like any\nother star, but it appears much brighter because it\u2019s so much closer\nto us. Why are the other stars so dim if not because their light gets\n\u201ctired,\u201d or \u201cwears out?\u201d It\u2019s not that the light rays are stopping,\nit\u2019s that they\u2019re getting spread out more thinly. The light comes\nout of the source in all directions, and if you\u2019re very far away, only\na tiny percentage of the light will go into your eye. (If all the light\nfrom a star went into your eye, you\u2019d be in trouble.)\nk/The light is four times dimmer\nattwicethedistance.\n140 Chapter 7 The Ray Model of Light Figure k shows what happens if you double your distance from\nthe source. The light from the flame spreads out in all directions.\nWe pick four representative rays from among those that happen\nto pass through the nearer square. Of these four, only one passes\nthrough the square of equal area at twice the distance. If the two\nequal-area squares were people\u2019s eyes, then only one fourth of the\nlight would go into the more distant person\u2019s eye.\nAnother way of thinking about it is that the light that passed\nthrough the first square spreads out and makes a bigger square; at\ndouble the distance, the square is twice as wide and twice as tall, so\nits area is 2\u00d72 = 4 times greater. The same light has been spread\nout over four times the area.\nIn general, the rule works like this:\n1\ndistance\u00d72 \u21d2 brightness\u00d7\n4\n1\ndistance\u00d73 \u21d2 brightness\u00d7\n9\n1\ndistance\u00d74 \u21d2 brightness\u00d7\n16\nTo get the 4, we multiplied 2 by itself, 9 came from multiplying 3 by\nitself, and so on. Multiplying a number by itself is called squaring\nit, and dividing one by a number is called inverting it, so a rela-\ntionship like this is known as an inverse square law. Inverse square\nlaws are very common in physics: they occur whenever something is\nspreadingoutinalldirectionsfromapoint. Physicistsalreadyknew\naboutthiskindofinversesquarelaw, forlight, beforeNewtonfound\nout that the force of gravity varied as an inverse square, so his law\nof gravity made sense to them intuitively, and they were ready to\naccept it. However, Newton\u2019s law of gravity doesn\u2019t describe grav-\nity as a substance that physically travels outward through space, so\nit\u2019s only a rough analogy. (One modern hypothesis about gravity\nis that the messages of gravitational attraction between two objects\nare actually carried by little particles, called gravitons, but nobody\nhas ever detected a graviton directly.)\nself-checkB\nAlice is one meter from the candle, while Bob is at a distance of five\nmeters.

In the previous examples, we\nSection 7.2 Applications 141 knew the distance and wanted to find the intensity (brightness).\nHere, we know about the intensity (loudness), and we want to\nfind out about the distance. Rather than taking a number and\nmultiplying it by itself to find the answer, we need to reverse the\nprocess,andfindthenumberthat,whenmultipliedbyitself,gives\nfour.

At night\nthey dilate, becoming bigger \u201clight buckets.\u201d Your perception of\nbrightness depends not only on the true brightness of the source\nand your distance from it, but also on how much area your pupils\npresent to the light. Cameras have a similar mechanism, which\nis easy to see if you detach the lens and its housing from the\nbody of the camera, as shown in the figure. Here, the diameter\nof the largest aperture is about ten times greater than that of the\nsmallest aperture.

Your brain\nwould know that this large angle implied a very small distance.\nThis is called the parallax angle. Objects at greater distances have\nsmaller parallax angles, and when the angles are small, it\u2019s a good\napproximation to say that the angle is inversely proportional to the\ndistance. In figure m, the parallax angle is almost exactly cut in\nhalf when the person moves twice as far away.\nParallax can be observed in other ways than with a pair of eye-\nballs. As a child, you noticed that when you walked around on a\nmoonlit evening, the moon seemed to follow you. The moon wasn\u2019t\nreally following you, and this isn\u2019t even a special property of the\nmoon. It\u2019s just that as you walk, you expect to observe a paral-\nlax angle between the same scene viewed from different positions\nof your whole head. Very distant objects, including those on the\nEarth\u2019s surface, have parallax angles too small to notice by walking\nback and forth. In general, rays coming from a very distant object\nare nearly parallel.\nIf your baseline is long enough, however, the small parallaxes\nof even very distant objects may be detectable. In the nineteenth\ncentury,nobodyknewhowtalltheHimalayaswere,orexactlywhere\ntheir peaks were on a map, and the Andes were generally believed\nto be the tallest mountains in the world. The Himalayas had never\nbeenclimbed,andcouldonlybeviewedfromadistance. Fromdown\non the plains of India, there was no way to tell whether they were\nvery tall mountains very far away, or relatively low ones that were\nmuch closer. British surveyor George Everest finally established\ntheir true distance, and astounding height, by observing the same\npeaks through a telescope from different locations far apart.\nAn even more spectacular feat of measurement was carried out\nby Hipparchus over twenty-one centuries ago. By measuring the\nparallax of the moon as observed from Alexandria and the Helle-\nspont, he determined its distance to be about 90 times the radius\nof the earth.2\n2The reason this was a hard measurement was that accurate clocks hadn\u2019t\nbeen invented, so there was no easy way to synchronize the two observations,\nand the desired effect would be masked by the apparent motion of the moon\nacrosstheskyasitroseandset.

For these stars,\nthe distances derived from parallax can be checked against the ones\nfound by the method of example 2 on page 142. They do check out,\nwhich verifies the assumption that the stars are objects analogous\nto our sun.\nn/The nearer star has a larger\nparallax angle.

Thisisnotjustapointless\ndetail about specular reflection. It\u2019s a manifestation of a very deep\nand important fact about nature, which is that the laws of physics\ndo not distinguish between past and future. Cannonballs and plan-\nets have trajectories that are equally natural in reverse, and so do\nlight rays. This type of symmetry is called time-reversal symmetry.\nTypically, time-reversal symmetry is a characteristic of any pro-\ncess that does not involve heat. For instance, the planets do not\nexperience any friction as they travel through empty space, so there\nis no frictional heating. We should thus expect the time-reversed\nversions of their orbits to obey the laws of physics, which they do.\nIn contrast, a book sliding across a table does generate heat from\nfriction as it slows down, and it is therefore not surprising that this\ntype of motion does not appear to obey time-reversal symmetry. A\nbook lying still on a flat table is never observed to spontaneously\nstartsliding,suckingupheatenergyandtransformingitintokinetic\nenergy.\nSimilarly, the only situation we\u2019ve observed so far where light\ndoes not obey time-reversal symmetry is absorption, which involves\nheat. Your skin absorbs visible light from the sun and heats up,\nbut we never observe people\u2019s skin to glow, converting heat energy\ninto visible light.

Although AQB is not the shortest possible path, it\ncannot be shortened by changing it infinitesimally, e.g., by moving\nQ a little to the right or left.

First bring this page closer wand\ncloser to your eyes, until you can no longer focus on it without\nstraining. Then go in the bathroom and see how close you can\nget your face to the surface of the mirror before you can no longer\neasily focus on the image of your own eyes. You will find that\nthe shortest comfortable eye-mirror distance is much less than the\nshortest comfortable eye-paper distance. This demonstrates that\nthe image of your face in the mirror acts as if it had depth and\nexisted in the space behind the mirror. If the image was like a flat\npicture in a book, then you wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on it from\nsuch a short distance.\nIn this chapter we will study the images formed by flat and\ncurved mirrors on a qualitative, conceptual basis. Although this\ntype of image is not as commonly encountered in everyday life as\nimages formed by lenses, images formed by reflection are simpler to\nunderstand.\nA virtual image\nWe can understand a mirror image using a ray diagram. Figure\nu shows several light rays, 1, that originated by diffuse reflection at\nthe person\u2019s nose. They bounce off the mirror, producing new rays,\n2. To anyone whose eye is in the right position to get one of these\nrays, they appear to have come from a behind the mirror, 3, where\nthey would have originated from a single point. This point is where\nthe tip of the image-person\u2019s nose appears to be.

(cid:46)Answer,p. 180\nThe geometry of specular reflection tells us that rays 1 and 2\nare at equal angles to the normal (the imaginary perpendicular line\npiercing the mirror at the point of reflection). This means that ray\n2\u2019s imaginary continuation, 3, forms the same angle with the mirror\nas ray 1. Since each ray of type 3 forms the same angles with the\nmirror as its partner of type 1, we see that the distance of the image\nfrom the mirror is the same as the actual face from the mirror, and\nlies directly across from it. The image therefore appears to be the\nsame size as the actual face.\nCurved mirrors\nAn image in a flat mirror is a pretechnological example: even\nanimals can look at their reflections in a calm pond. We now pass\nto our first nontrivial example of the manipulation of an image by\ntechnology: an image in a curved mirror. Before we dive in, let\u2019s\nconsider why this is an important example. If it was just a ques-\ntion of memorizing a bunch of facts about curved mirrors, then you\nwould rightly rebel against an effort to spoil the beauty of your lib-\nerally educated brain by force-feeding you technological trivia. The\nreason this is an important example is not that curved mirrors are\nso important in and of themselves, but that the results we derive for\ncurved bowl-shaped mirrors turn out to be true for a large class of\nv/An image formed by a other optical devices, including mirrors that bulge outward rather\ncurvedmirror.\nthan inward, and lenses as well. A microscope or a telescope is sim-\nply a combination of lenses or mirrors or both.

(The surface itself would be\n148 Chapter 7 The Ray Model of Light described as concave. The term is not all that hard to remember,\nbecause the hollowed-out interior of the mirror is like a cave.) It\nis surprising but true that all the rays like 3 really do converge on\na point, forming a good image. We will not prove this fact, but it\nis true for any mirror whose curvature is gentle enough and that\nis symmetric with respect to rotation about the perpendicular line\npassing through its center (not asymmetric like a potato chip). The\nold-fashioned method of making mirrors and lenses is by grinding\nthem in grit by hand, and this automatically tends to produce an\nalmost perfect spherical surface.\nBendingaraylike2inwardimpliesbendingitsimaginarycontin-\nuation 3 outward, in the same way that raising one end of a seesaw\ncauses the other end to go down.

The point\nwhere they cross is the image of the point on the original object.\nThis type of image is called a real image, in contradistinction to the\nvirtual images we\u2019ve studied before.

With no\nforces on it, the spring assumes its equilibrium length, 8/1. It can\nbe stretched, 2, or compressed, 3. We attach the spring to a wall\non the left and to a mass on the right.

One complete repetition of the motion is\ncalled a cycle.\nWe are used to referring to short-period sound vibrations as\n\u201chigh\u201d in pitch, and it sounds odd to have to say that high pitches\nhave low periods. It is therefore more common to discuss the rapid-\nity of a vibration in terms of the number of vibrations per second,\na quantity called the frequency, f.

The amplitude of a Microcomputers these days operate at clock frequencies of about a\nswinging pendulum would more gigahertz.\nnaturally be defined as an angle.\nWe have discussed how to measure how fast something vibrates,\nbut not how big the vibrations are. The general term for this is\n162 Chapter 8 Waves amplitude, A. The definition of amplitude depends on the system\nbeing discussed, and two people discussing the same system may\nnot even use the same definition. In the example of the block on\nthe end of the spring, 8.1/1, the amplitude will be measured in\ndistance units such as cm. One could work in terms of the distance\ntraveledbytheblockfromtheextremelefttotheextremeright, but\nit would be somewhat more common in physics to use the distance\nfrom the center to one extreme. The former is usually referred to as\nthe peak-to-peak amplitude, since the extremes of the motion look\nlike mountain peaks or upside-down mountain peaks on a graph of\nposition versus time.\nIn other situations we would not even use the same units for am-\nplitude. The amplitude of a child on a swing, or a pendulum, 8.1/2,\nwould most conveniently be measured as an angle, not a distance,\nsince her feet will move a greater distance than her head. The elec-\ntrical vibrations in a radio receiver would be measured in electrical\nunits such as volts or amperes.\nIn many physical examples of vibrations, the force that brings\nthe vibrating object back to equilibrium gets stronger and stronger\nas the object gets father and farther from equilibrium, and the force\nis directly proportional to the distance from equilibrium. Most\nsprings behave this way, for example, so for example we\u2019d expect\nthat the spring in figure 8 would make very nearly twice the force\nwhen stretched twice as much. We then define a spring constant,,\nwhichtellsushowmanynewtonsofforcewegetpermeterofstretch-\ning. For example, the John Hancock Tower has a spring constant of\nabout 200 MN/m (meganewtons per meter), meaning that the wind\nmustexertaforceofabout200MNinordertomakethetowersway\nby one meter. To make it sway by two meters, the force would have\nto be 400 MN.\nWhen the force has this type of mathematical behavior, the re-\nsulting motion is known as simple harmonic motion. One surprising\nand useful fact about simple harmonic motion is that its frequency\nis independent of amplitude. Intuitively, we would expect that vi-\nbrations with a greater amplitude would take more time, i.e., have a c/The John Hancock Tower\nlower frequency. However, when the amplitude is greater, the force in Boston vibrates naturally at a\naccelerating the mass back toward the equilibrium position is also frequency of 0.14 Hz.

Legend has it that Galileo first noticed\nvibrations\nthis fact when he watched a chandelier swinging during a church\nservice, and timed it against his pulse. Mathematically, the fre-\n(cid:112)\nquency of vibration is given by f = (1/2\u03c0) k/m, where k is the\nspring constant, and m is the mass that is vibrating.\nSection 8.1 Vibrations 163 d/The two circular patterns of\nripples pass through each other.\nUnlikematerialobjects,wavepat-\nterns can overlap in space, and\nwhen this happens they combine\nbyaddition.\n8.2 Wave motion\nThere are three main ways in which wave motion differs from the\nmotion of objects made of matter.\n1. Superposition\nThe first, and most profound, difference between wave motion\nand the motion of objects is that waves do not display any repulsion\nof each other analogous to the normal forces between objects that\ncome in contact. Two wave patterns can therefore overlap in the\nsame region of space, as shown in the figure at the top of the page.\nWhere the two waves coincide, they add together. For instance,\nsuppose that at a certain location in at a certain moment in time,\neach wave would have had a crest 3 cm above the normal water\nlevel. The waves combine at this point to make a 6-cm crest. We\nuse negative numbers to represent depressions in the water. If both\nwaveswouldhavehadatroughsmeasuring-3cm,thentheycombine\nto make an extra-deep -6 cm trough. A +3 cm crest and a -3 cm\ntrough result in a height of zero, i.e., the waves momentarily cancel\neach other out at that point. This additive rule is referred to as\nthe principle of superposition, \u201csuperposition\u201d being merely a fancy\nword for \u201cadding.\u201d\nSuperposition can occur not just with sinusoidal waves like the\nones in the figure above but with waves of any shape. The figures\non the following page show superposition of wave pulses. A pulse is\nsimply a wave of very short duration. These pulses consist only of\n164 Chapter 8 Waves a single hump or trough. If you hit a clothesline sharply, you will\nobserve pulses heading off in both directions. This is analogous to\nthe way ripples spread out in all directions when you make a distur-\nbance at one point on water. The same occurs when the hammer\non a piano comes up and hits a string.\nDiscussion question\nA In figure e, the fifth frame shows the spring just about perfectly\nflat. If the two pulses have essentially canceled each other out perfectly,\nthenwhydoesthemotionpickupagain?

The medium is not transported with the wave.\nFigure f shows a series of water waves before it has reached a\nrubber duck (left), having just passed the duck (middle) and having\nprogressed about a meter beyond the duck (right). The duck bobs\naround its initial position, but is not carried along with the wave.\nThis shows that the water itself does not flow outward with the\nwave. If it did, we could empty one end of a swimming pool simply\nby kicking up waves! We must distinguish between the motion of\nthe medium (water in this case) and the motion of the wave pattern\nthrough the medium. The medium vibrates; the wave progresses\nthrough space.\nself-checkA\nInfigureg,youcandetecttheside-to-sidemotionofthespringbecause\nthe spring appears blurry.

A wave\u2019s velocity depends on the medium.\nA material object can move with any velocity, and can be sped\nup or slowed down by a force that increases or decreases its kinetic\nenergy. Not so with waves. The magnitude of a wave\u2019s velocity\ndepends on the properties of the medium (and perhaps also on the\nshape of the wave, for certain types of waves). Sound waves travel\nat about 340 m/s in air, 1000 m/s in helium. If you kick up water\ni/Example 4: a breaking\nwaves in a pool, you will find that kicking harder makes waves that\nwave.\nare taller (and therefore carry more energy), not faster.

In the following section we will\ngiveanexampleofthephysicalrelationshipbetweenthewavespeed\nand the properties of the medium.\nBreaking waves example 4\nThe velocity of water waves increases with depth. The crest of a\nwave travels faster than the trough, and this can cause the wave\nto break.\nOnce a wave is created, the only reason its speed will change is\nif it enters a different medium or if the properties of the medium\nchange. It is not so surprising that a change in medium can slow\ndown a wave, but the reverse can also happen. A sound wave trav-\neling through a helium balloon will slow down when it emerges into\nj/Example 5.

The wave\u2019s speed de-\npends only on the medium. Adding energy to the wave doesn\u2019t\nspeed it up, it just increases its amplitude.\nA water wave, unlike many other types of wave, has a speed that\ndepends on its shape: a broader wave moves faster.

Sounds do not knock other\nsoundsoutofthewaywhentheycollide,andwecanhearmore\nthan one sound at once if they both reach our ear simultane-\nously.\n\u2022 The medium does not move with the sound. Even standing\nin front of a titanic speaker playing earsplitting music, we do\nnot feel the slightest breeze.\n\u2022 The velocity of sound depends on the medium. Sound travels\nfasterinheliumthaninair, andfasterinwaterthaninhelium.\nPutting more energy into the wave makes it more intense, not\nfaster. For example, you can easily detect an echo when you\nclap your hands a short distance from a large, flat wall, and\nthe delay of the echo is no shorter for a louder clap.\nAlthough not all waves have a speed that is independent of the\nshape of the wave, and this property therefore is irrelevant to our\ncollection of evidence that sound is a wave phenomenon, sound does\nnevertheless have this property. For instance, the music in a large\nconcert hall or stadium may take on the order of a second to reach\nsomeone seated in the nosebleed section, but we do not notice or\ncare, because the delay is the same for every sound. Bass, drums,\nand vocals all head outward from the stage at 340 m/s, regardless\nof their differing wave shapes.\nIf sound has all the properties we expect from a wave, then what\ntype of wave is it? It must be a vibration of a physical medium such\nas air, since the speed of sound is different in different media, such\nas helium or water. Further evidence is that we don\u2019t receive sound\nsignalsthathavecometoourplanetthroughouterspace. Theroars\nand whooshes of Hollywood\u2019s space ships are fun, but scientifically\nwrong.1\nWe can also tell that sound waves consist of compressions and\nexpansions, rather than sideways vibrations like the shimmying of a\nsnake. Only compressional vibrations would be able to cause your\n1Outer space is not a perfect vacuum, so it is possible for sounds waves to\ntravel through it.

An isolated tuning fork, left to vibrate in interstellar space,\nwould dissipate the energy of its vibration into internal heat at a rate many\norders of magnitude greater than the rate of sound emission into the nearly\nperfect vacuum around it.\nSection 8.3 Sound and light waves 169 eardrums to vibrate in and out. Even for a very loud sound, the\ncompression is extremely weak; the increase or decrease compared\nto normal atmospheric pressure is no more than a part per million.\nOur ears are apparently very sensitive receivers!\nLight waves\nEntirely similar observations lead us to believe that light is a\nwave, although the concept of light as a wave had a long and tortu-\nous history. It is interesting to note that Isaac Newton very influen-\ntially advocated a contrary idea about light. The belief that matter\nwas made of atoms was stylish at the time among radical thinkers\n(although there was no experimental evidence for their existence),\nanditseemedlogicaltoNewtonthatlightaswellshouldbemadeof\ntinyparticles, whichhecalledcorpuscles(Latinfor\u201csmallobjects\u201d).\nNewton\u2019s triumphs in the science of mechanics, i.e., the study of\nmatter, brought him such great prestige that nobody bothered to\nquestion his incorrect theory of light for 150 years. One persua-\nsive proof that light is a wave is that according to Newton\u2019s theory,\ntwo intersecting beams of light should experience at least some dis-\nruption because of collisions between their corpuscles. Even if the\ncorpuscles were extremely small, and collisions therefore very infre-\nquent, at least some dimming should have been measurable. In fact,\nvery delicate experiments have shown that there is no dimming.\nThewavetheoryoflightwasentirelysuccessfulupuntilthe20th\ncentury, when it was discovered that not all the phenomena of light\ncould be explained with a pure wave theory. It is now believed that\nboth light and matter are made out of tiny chunks which have both\nwave and particle properties. For now, we will content ourselves\nwith the wave theory of light, which is capable of explaining a great\nmany things, from cameras to rainbows.\nIf light is a wave, what is waving? What is the medium that\nwiggles when a light wave goes by? It isn\u2019t air. A vacuum is impen-\netrable to sound, but light from the stars travels happily through\nzillionsofmilesofemptyspace. Lightbulbshavenoairinsidethem,\nbut that doesn\u2019t prevent the light waves from leaving the filament.\nFor a long time, physicists assumed that there must be a mysterious\nmedium for light waves, and they called it the aether (not to be con-\nfused with the chemical). Supposedly the aether existed everywhere\nin space, and was immune to vacuum pumps. We now know that,\nas discussed in chapter 6, light can instead be explained as a wave\npattern made up of electrical and magnetic fields.\n8.4 Periodic waves\nPeriod and frequency of a periodic wave\nYou choose a radio station by selecting a certain frequency. We\nhave already defined period and frequency for vibrations, but what\n170 Chapter 8 Waves do they signify in the case of a wave? We can recycle our previous\ndefinition simply by stating it in terms of the vibrations that the\nwave causes as it passes a receiving instrument at a certain point\nin space. For a sound wave, this receiver could be an eardrum or\na microphone. If the vibrations of the eardrum repeat themselves\nover and over, i.e., are periodic, then we describe the sound wave\nm/A graph of pressure ver-\nthat caused them as periodic. Likewise we can define the period\nsus time for a periodic sound\nand frequency of a wave in terms of the period and frequency of\nwave,thevowel\u201cah.\u201d\nthe vibrations it causes.

Many phenomena that we do not normally think of as\nlight are actually just forms of light that are invisible because they\nfall outside the range of frequencies our eyes can detect. Beyond the\nred end of the visible rainbow, there are infrared and radio waves.\nPast the violet end, we have ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays.\nGraphs of waves as a function of position\nSome waves, like sound waves, are easy to study by placing a\ndetector at a certain location in space and studying the motion as\na function of time. The result is a graph whose horizontal axis is\ntime. With a water wave, on the other hand, it is simpler just to\nlook at the wave directly. This visual snapshot amounts to a graph\nof the height of the water wave as a function of position.

Taking the\nseismometer as an example, the chart is essentially a record of the\nground\u2019s wave motion as a function of time, but if the paper was set\nto feed at the same velocity as the motion of an earthquake wave, it\nwould also be a full-scale representation of the profile of the actual\nwave pattern itself. Assuming, as is usually the case, that the wave\nvelocity is a constant number regardless of the wave\u2019s shape, know-\ning the wave motion as a function of time is equivalent to knowing\nit as a function of position.\nSection 8.4 Periodic waves 171 Wavelength\nAny wave that is periodic will also display a repeating pattern\nwhen graphed as a function of position.

This effect can be observed when ocean waves come up to\nthe shore.

You can\u2019t get rid of it even if you want to.\nPage 13, self-check B: Exponents have to do with multiplication, not addition. The first line\nshould be 100 times longer than the second, not just twice as long.\nPage 26, self-check C: Doubling d makes d2 four times bigger, so the gravitational field\nexperienced by Mars is four times weaker.\nAnswers to Self-Checks for Chapter 2\nPage 40, self-check A:No,itdoesn\u2019tviolatesymmetry. Space-translationsymmetryonlysays\nthat space itself has the same properties everywhere. It doesn\u2019t say that all regions of space\nhave the same stuff in them. The experiment on the earth comes out a certain way because that\nregion of space has a planet in it. The experiment on the moon comes out different because\nthat region of space has the moon in it. of the apparatus, which you forgot to take with you.\nPage 42, self-check B: The camera is moving at half the speed at which the light ball is\ninitially moving. After the collision, it keeps on moving at the same speed \u2014 your five x\u2019s all\nline on a straight line. Since the camera moves in a straight line with constant speed, it is\nshowing an inertial frame of reference.\nPage 43, self-check C: The table looks like this:\nvelocity (meters per second)\nbefore the colli- after the collision change\nsion\n\u22121 0 +1\n0 \u22121 \u22121\nObservers in all three frames agree on the changes in velocity, even though they disagree on the\nvelocities themselves.\nPage 50, self-check D: The motion would be the same. The force on the ball would be 20\nnewtons, so with each second it would gain 20 units of momentum. But 20 units of momentum\nfor a 2-kilogram ball is still just 10 m/s of velocity.\nAnswers to Self-Checks for Chapter 3\nPage 65, self-check A:Thedefinitionoftorqueisimportant, andsoistheequationF = \u00b1Fr.\nThe two equations in between are just steps in a derivation of F = \u00b1Fr.\nAnswers to Self-Checks for Chapter 4\nPage 86, self-check A: The total momentum is zero before the collision. After the collision,\nthetwomomentahavereversedtheirdirections,buttheystillcancel. Neitherobjecthaschanged\nits kinetic energy, so the total energy before and after the collision is also the same.\n179 Answers to Self-Checks for Chapter 5\nPage 97, self-check A: Either type can be involved in either an attraction or a repulsion. A\npositive charge could be involved in either an attraction (with a negative charge) or a repulsion\n(withanotherpositive), andanegativecouldparticipateineitheranattraction(withapositive)\nor a repulsion (with a negative).\nPage 97, self-check B:Itwouldn\u2019t make anydifference. The rolesof thepositiveand negative\ncharges in the paper would be reversed, but there would still be a net attraction.\nAnswers to Self-Checks for Chapter 6\nPage 124, self-check A: An induced electric field can only be created by a changing magnetic\nfield. Nothing is changing if your car is just sitting there. A point on the coil won\u2019t experience\na changing magnetic field unless the coil is already spinning, i.e., the engine has already turned\nover.\nAnswers to Self-Checks for Chapter 7\nPage 138, self-check A: Only 1 is correct. If you draw the normal that bisects the solid ray,\nit also bisects the dashed ray.\nPage 141, self-check B: He\u2019s five times farther away than she is, so the light he sees is 1/25\nthe brightness.\nPage 148, self-check C: You should have found from your ray diagram that an image is still\nformed, and it has simply moved down the same distance as the real face. However, this new\nimage would only be visible from high up, and the person can no longer see his own image.\nPage 150, self-check D: Increasing the distance from the face to the mirror has decreased the\ndistance from the image to the mirror. This is the opposite of what happened with the virtual\nimage.\nAnswers to Self-Checks for Chapter 8\nPage 166, self-check A: The leading edge is moving up, the trailing edge is moving down,\nand the top of the hump is motionless for one instant.\nSolutions to Selected Homework Problems\nSolutions for chapter 1\nPage 33, problem 1:\n10\u22123 g 10\u22123 kg\n134 mg\u00d7 \u00d7 = 1.34\u00d710\u22124 kg\n1 mg 1 g\nSolutions for chapter 3\nPage 68, problem 4: The pliers are not moving, so their angular momentum remains constant\nat zero, and the total torque on them must be zero. Not only that, but each half of the pliers\nmust have zero total torque on it. This tells us that the magnitude of the torque at one end\nmust be the same as that at the other end. The distance from the axis to the nut is about 2.5\ncm, and the distance from the axis to the centers of the palm and fingers are about 8 cm. The\nangles are close enough to 90\u25e6 that we can pretend they\u2019re 90 degrees, considering the rough\nnature of the other assumptions and measurements. The result is (300 N)(2.5 cm) = (F)(8 cm),\n180 or F = 90 N.\n181 Index\nabsorption, 135 for relativistic momentum, 87\nalchemy, 94 for time dilation, 72\nammeter, 101 coulomb (unit), 96\nampere
